The boys were accordingly told  to assemble after school hours at a well-known tombstone in the  neighbouring Churchyard, as something of importance was under  consideration. The place of meeting was an elevated parallelogram  tombstone, which had always served as a kind of council table to  settle our little disputes as well as parties of pleasure. Here we all  assembled at the appointed time. Our leader took his stand at one end  of the stone, with the head boys who were in the secret on each side  of him. 'My boys (he laconically observed), to-morrow morning we are  to _bar-out_ the flogging parson, and to make him promise that he will  not flog us hereafter without a cause, nor set us long tasks or  deprive us of our holidays. The boys of the Greek form will be your  Captains, and I am to be your Captain-General. Those that are cowards  had better retire and be satisfied with future floggings; but you, who  have courage, and know what it is to have been flogged for nothing,  come here and sign your names.' He immediately pulled out a pen and a  sheet of paper; and having tied some bits of thread round the  finger-ends of two or three boys, with a pin he drew blood to answer  for ink, and to give more solemnity to the act. He signed the first,  the Captains next, and the rest in succession. Many of the lesser boys  slunk away during the ceremony; but on counting the names we found we  mustered upwards of forty--sufficient, it was imagined, even to carry  the school by storm. The Captain-General then addressed us: 'I have  the key of the school, and shall be there at seven o'clock. The old  Parson will arrive at nine, and every one of you must be there before  eight to allow us one hour for barricading the doors and windows.  Bring with you as much provision as you can; and tell your parents  that you have to take your dinners in school. Let every one of you  have some weapon of defence; you who cannot obtain a sword, pistol, or  poker, must bring a stick or cudgel. Now, all go home directly, and be  sure to arrive early in the morning.'    \"Perhaps a more restless and anxious night was never passed by young  recruits on the eve of a general battle. Many of us rose some hours  before the time; and at seven o'clock, when the school door was  opened, there was a tolerably numerous muster. Our Captain immediately  ordered candles to be lighted, and a rousing fire to be made (for it  was a dark December's morning). He then began to examine the store of  provisions, and the arms which each had brought. In the meantime, the  arrival of every boy with additional material was announced by  tremendous cheers.    \"At length the Church Clock struck eight. 'Proceed to barricade the  doors and windows,' exclaimed the Captain, 'or the old lion will be  upon us before we are prepared to meet him.' In an instant the old  oaken door rang on its heavy hinges. Some, with hammers, gimlets, and  nails, were eagerly securing the windows, while others were dragging  along the ponderous desks, forms, and everything portable, to  blockade, with certain security, every place which might admit of  ingress. This operation being completed, the Captain mounted the  master's rostrum, and called over the list of names, when he found  only two or three missing. He then proceeded to classify them into  divisions, or companies of six, and assigned to each its respective  Captain. He prescribed the duties of each company. Two were to guard  the large casement window, where, it was expected, the first attack  would be made; this was considered the post of honour, and,  consequently, the strongest boys, with the most formidable weapons,  were selected, whom we called Grenadiers. Another company, whom we  considered as the Light Infantry, or Sharp Shooters, were ordered to  mount a large desk in the centre of the School; and, armed with  squibs, crackers, and various missiles, they were to attack the enemy  over the heads of the Combatants. The other divisions were to guard  the back windows and door, and to act according to the emergency of  the moment. Our leader then moved some resolutions (which, in  imitation of Brutus, he had cogitated during the previous night), to  the effect that each individual should implicitly obey his own  Captain; that each Captain should follow the orders of the  Captain-general, and that a _corps de reserve_ should be stationed in  the rear, to enforce this obedience, and prevent the combatants from  taking to flight. The resolutions were passed amid loud vociferations.    \"We next commenced an examination of the various weapons, and found  them to consist of one old blunderbuss, one pistol, two old swords, a  few rusty pokers, and sticks, stones, squibs, and gunpowder in  abundance. The firearms were immediately loaded with blank powder; the  swords were sharpened, and the pokers heated in the fire. These  weapons were assigned to the most daring company, who had to protect  the principal window. The missiles were for the light infantry, and  all the rest were armed with sticks.    \"We now began to manoeuvre our companies, by marching them into line  and column, so that every one might know his own situation. In the  midst of this preparation, the sentinel whom we had placed at the  window, loudly vociferated, 'The parson! The parson's coming!'    \"In an instant all was confusion. Every one ran he knew not where; as  if eager to fly, or screen himself from observation. Our captain  immediately mounted a form, and called to the captains of the two  leading companies to take their stations. They immediately obeyed;  and the other companies followed their example; though they found it  much more difficult to manoeuvre when danger approached than they  had a few minutes before! The well-known footstep, which had often  struck on our ears with terror, was now heard to advance along the  portico. The muttering of his stern voice sounded in our ears like the  lion's growl. A death-like silence prevailed: we scarcely dared to  breathe: the palpitations of our little hearts could, perhaps, alone  be heard. The object of our dread then went round to the front window,  for the purpose of ascertaining whether any one was in the school.  Every footstep struck us with awe: not a word, not a whisper was  heard. He approached close to the window; and with an astonished  countenance stood gazing upon us, while we were ranged in battle  array, motionless statues, and silent as the tomb. 'What is the  meaning of this?' he impatiently exclaimed. But no answer could he  obtain, for who would then have dared to render himself conspicuous by  a reply? Pallid countenances and livid lips betrayed our fears. The  courage, which one hour before was ready to brave every danger,  appeared to be fled. Every one seemed anxious to conceal himself from  view: and there would, certainly, have been a general flight through  the back windows had it not been for the prudent regulation of a  _corps de reserve,_ armed with cudgels, to prevent it.    \"'You young scoundrels, open the door instantly,' he again exclaimed;  and, what added to our indescribable horror, in a fit of rage he  dashed his hand through the window, which consisted of diamond-shaped  panes, and appeared as if determined to force his way in.    \"Fear and trepidation, attended by an increasing commotion, now  possessed us all. At this critical moment every eye turned to our  captain, as if to reproach him for having brought us into this  terrible dilemma. He alone stood unmoved; but he saw that none would  have courage to obey his commands. Some exciting stimulus was  necessary. Suddenly waving his hand, he exclaimed aloud, 'Three cheers  for the barring-out, and success to our cause!' The cheers were  tremendous; our courage revived; the blood flushed in our cheeks; the  parson was breaking in; the moment was critical. Our Captain,  undaunted, sprang to the fire-place--seized a heated poker in one  hand, and a blazing torch in the other. The latter he gave to the  captain of the sharp shooters, and told him to prepare a volley; when,  with red-hot poker, he fearlessly advanced to the window seat; and,  daring his master to enter, he ordered an attack--and an attack,  indeed, was made, sufficiently tremendous to have repelled a more  powerful assailant. The missiles flew at the ill-fated window from  every quarter. The blunderbuss and the pistol were fired; squibs and  crackers, inkstands and rulers, stones, and even burning coals, came  in showers about the casement, and broke some of the panes into a  thousand pieces; while blazing torches, heated pokers, and sticks,  stood bristling under the window. The whole was scarcely the work of a  minute: the astonished master reeled back in dumb amazement. He had,  evidently, been struck with a missile or with the broken glass; and  probably fancied that he had been wounded by the firearms. The schools  now rang with the shouts of 'Victory,' and continued cheering. 'The  enemy again approaches,' cried the captain; 'fire another  volley;--stay, he seeks a parley--hear him.' 'What is the meaning, I  say, of this horrid tumult?' 'The barring-out, the barring-out!' a  dozen voices instantly exclaimed. 'For shame,' says he, in a tone  evidently subdued; what disgrace are you bringing upon yourselves and  the schools. What will the Trustees--what will your parents say?  William,' continued he, addressing the captain, 'open the door without  further delay.' 'I will, Sir,' he replied, 'on your promising to  pardon us, and give us our lawful holidays, of which we have lately  been deprived; and not set us tasks during the holidays.' 'Yes, yes,'  said several squealing voices, 'that is what we want; and not to be  flogged for nothing.' 'You insolent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#13)"],[1,"claws; and on some one's informing  the young lady of these proceedings of the cat and kittens, suppose she  answered that it wasn't her cat, but her sister's, and the pictures  weren't hers, but her uncle's, and she couldn't leave her work, for she  had to make so many pairs of comforters before dinner. Would you not say  that the prudent and kind young lady was, on the whole, answerable for  the additional touches of claw on the Vandykes?      84. Now, that is precisely what we prudent and kind English are doing,  only on a larger scale. Here we sit in Manchester, hard at work, very  properly, making comforters for our cousins all over the world. Just  outside there in the hall--that beautiful marble hall of Italy--the cats  and kittens and monkeys are at play among the pictures: I assure you, in  the course of the fifteen years in which I have been working in those  places in which the most precious remnants of European art exist, a  sensation, whether I would or no, was gradually made distinct and deep  in my mind, that I was living and working in the midst of a den of  monkeys;--sometimes amiable and affectionate monkeys, with all manner of  winning ways and kind intentions,--more frequently selfish and  malicious monkeys; but, whatever their disposition, squabbling  continually about nuts, and the best places on the barren sticks of  trees; and that all this monkeys' den was filled, by mischance, with  precious pictures, and the witty and wilful beasts were always wrapping  themselves up and going to sleep in pictures, or tearing holes in them  to grin through; or tasting them and spitting them out again, or  twisting them up into ropes and making swings of them; and that  sometimes only, by watching one's opportunity, and bearing a scratch or  a bite, one could rescue the corner of a Tintoret, or Paul Veronese, and  push it through the bars into a place of safety.      85. Literally, I assure you, this was, and this is, the fixed impression  on my mind of the state of matters in Italy. And see how. The professors  of art in Italy, having long followed a method of study peculiar to  themselves, have at last arrived at a form of art peculiar to  themselves; very different from that which was arrived at by Correggio  and Titian. Naturally, the professors like their own form the best; and,  as the old pictures are generally not so startling to the eye as the  modern ones, the dukes and counts who possess them, and who like to see  their galleries look new and fine (and are persuaded also that a  celebrated chef-d'oeuvre ought always to catch the eye at a quarter of a  mile off), believe the professors who tell them their sober pictures are  quite faded, and good for nothing, and should all be brought bright  again; and, accordingly, give the sober pictures to the professors, to  be put right by rules of art. Then, the professors repaint the old  pictures in all the principal places, leaving perhaps only a bit of  background to set off their own work. And thus the professors come to be  generally figured, in my mind, as the monkeys who tear holes in the  pictures, to grin through. Then the picture-dealers, who live by the  pictures, cannot sell them to the English in their old and pure state;  all the good work must be covered with new paint, and varnished so as to  look like one of the professorial pictures in the great gallery, before  it is saleable. And thus the dealers come to be imaged, in my mind, as  the monkeys who make ropes of the pictures, to swing by. Then, every now  and then at some old stable, or wine-cellar, or timber-shed, behind  some forgotten vats or faggots, somebody finds a fresco of Perugino's or  Giotto's, but doesn't think much of it, and has no idea of having people  coming into his cellar, or being obliged to move his faggots; and so he  whitewashes the fresco, and puts the faggots back again; and these kind  of persons, therefore, come generally to be imaged, in my mind, as the  monkeys who taste the pictures, and spit them out, not finding them  nice. While, finally, the squabbling for nuts and apples (called in  Italy \"bella liberta\") goes on all day long.      86. Now, all this might soon be put an end to, if we English, who are so  fond of travelling in the body, would also travel a little in soul! We  think it a great triumph to get our packages and our persons carried at  a fast pace, but we never take the slightest trouble to put any pace  into our perceptions; we stay usually at home in thought, or if we ever  mentally see the world, it is at the old stage-coach or waggon rate. Do  but consider what an odd sight it would be, if it were only quite clear  to you how things are really going on--how, here in England, we are  making enormous and expensive efforts to produce new art of all kinds,  knowing and confessing all the while that the greater part of it is bad,  but struggling still to produce new patterns of wall-papers, and new  shapes of teapots, and new pictures, and statues, and architecture; and  pluming and cackling if ever a teapot or a picture has the least good in  it;--all the while taking no thought whatever of the best possible  pictures, and statues, and wall-patterns already in existence, which  require nothing but to be taken common care of, and kept from damp and  dust: but we let the walls fall that Giotto patterned, and the canvases  rot that Tintoret painted, and the architecture be dashed to pieces that  St. Louis built, while we are furnishing our drawing-rooms with prize  upholstery, and writing accounts of our handsome warehouses to the  country papers. Don't think I use my words vaguely or generally: I speak  of literal facts. Giotto's frescoes at Assisi are perishing at this  moment for want of decent care; Tintoret's pictures in San Sebastian, at  Venice, are at this instant rotting piecemeal into grey rags; St.  Louis's chapel, at Carcassonne, is at this moment lying in shattered  fragments in the market-place. And here we are all cawing and crowing,  poor little half-fledged daws as we are, about the pretty sticks and  wool in our own nests. There's hardly a day passes, when I am at home,  but I get a letter from some well-meaning country clergyman, deeply  anxious about the state of his parish church, and breaking his heart to  get money together that he may hold up some wretched remnant of Tudor  tracery, with one niche in the corner and no statue--when all the while  the mightiest piles of religious architecture and sculpture that ever  the world saw are being blasted and withered away, without one glance of  pity or regret. The country clergyman does not care for _them_--he has a  sea-sick imagination that cannot cross channel. What is it to him, if  the angels of Assisi fade from its vaults, or the queens and kings of  Chartres fall from their pedestals? They are not in his parish.      87. \"What!\" you will say, \"are we not to produce any new art, nor take  care of our parish churches?\" No, certainly not, until you have taken  proper care of the art you have got already, and of the best churches  out of the parish. Your first and proper standing is not as  churchwardens and parish overseers, in an English county, but as members  of the great Christian community of Europe. And as members of that  community (in which alone, observe, pure and precious ancient art  exists, for there is none in America, none in Asia, none in Africa), you  conduct yourselves precisely as a manufacturer would, who attended to  his looms, but left his warehouse without a roof. The rain floods your  warehouse, the rats frolic in it, the spiders spin in it, the choughs  build in it, the wall-plague frets and festers in it; and still you keep  weave, weave, weaving at your wretched webs, and thinking you are  growing rich, while more is gnawed out of your warehouse in an hour than  you can weave in a twelvemonth.      88. Even this similitude is not absurd enough to set us rightly forth.  The weaver would, or might, at least, hope that his new woof was as  stout as the old ones, and that, therefore, in spite of rain and ravage,  he would have something to wrap himself in when he needed it. But _our_  webs rot as we spin. The very fact that we despise the great art of the  past shows that we cannot produce great art now. If we could do it, we  should love it when we saw it done--if we really cared for it, we should  recognize it and keep it; but we don't care for it. It is not art that  we want; it is amusement, gratification of pride, present gain--anything  in the world but art: let it rot, we shall always have enough to talk  about and hang over our sideboards.      89. You will (I hope) finally ask me what is the outcome of all this,  practicable tomorrow morning by us who are sitting here? These are the  main practical outcomes of it: In the first place, don't grumble when  you hear of a new picture being bought by Government at a large price.  There are many pictures in Europe now in danger of destruction which  are, in the true sense of the word, priceless; the proper price is  simply that which it is necessary to give to get and to save them. If  you can get them for fifty pounds, do; if not for less than a hundred,  do; if not for less than five thousand, do; if not for less than twenty  thousand, do; never mind being imposed upon: there is nothing  disgraceful in being imposed upon; the only disgrace is in imposing;  and you can't in general get anything much worth having, in the way of  Continental art, but it must be with the help or connivance of numbers  of people who, indeed, ought to have nothing to do with the matter, but  who practically have, and always will have, everything to do with it;  and if you don't choose to submit to be cheated by them out of a ducat  here and a zecchin there, you will be cheated by them out of your  picture; and whether you are most imposed upon in losing that, or the  zecchins, I think I may leave you to judge;"]]]
