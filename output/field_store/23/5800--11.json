They soon come to rest, and germinate in    the same way as those of the white rusts and mildews.      As soon as the sporangium is emptied, a new one is formed, either by    the filament growing up through it (Fig. 36, _F_) and the end being    again cut off, or else by a branch budding out just below the base    of the empty sporangium, and growing up by the side of it.      Besides zooespores there are also resting spores developed. Ooegonia    like those of _Vaucheria_ or the _Peronosporeae_ are formed usually    after the formation of zooespores has ceased; but in many cases,    perhaps all, these develop without being fertilized. Antheridia are    often wanting, and even when they are present, it is very doubtful    whether fertilization takes place.[5]    [5] The antheridia, when present, arise as branches just below the  ooegonium, and become closely applied to it, sometimes sending tubes  through its wall, but there has been no satisfactory demonstration of  an actual transfer of the contents of the antheridium to the egg cell.      The ooegonia (Fig. 36, _G_, _H_) arise at the end of the main    filaments, or of short side branches, very much as do the sporangia,    from which they differ at this stage in being of globular form. The    contents contract to form one or several egg cells, naked at first,    but later becoming thick-walled resting spores (_H_).          CHAPTER IX.    THE TRUE FUNGI (_Mycomycetes_).      The great majority of the plants ordinarily known as _fungi_ are  embraced under this head. While some of the lower forms show  affinities with the _Phycomycetes_, and through them with the algae,  the greater number differ very strongly from all green plants both in  their habits and in their structure and reproduction. It is a  much-disputed point whether sexual reproduction occurs in any of them,  and it is highly probable that in the great majority, at any rate, the  reproduction is purely non-sexual.    Probably to be reckoned with the _Mycomycetes_, but of doubtful  affinities, are the small unicellular fungi that are the main causes  of alcoholic fermentation; these are the yeast fungi (_Saccharomycetes_).  They cause the fermentation of beer and wine, as well as the incipient  fermentation in bread, causing it to \"rise\" by the giving off of  bubbles of carbonic acid gas during the process.    If a little common yeast is put into water containing starch or sugar,  and kept in a warm place, in a short time bubbles of gas will make  their appearance, and after a little longer time alcohol may be  detected by proper tests; in short, alcoholic fermentation is taking  place in the solution.      If a little of the fermenting liquid is examined microscopically, it    will be found to contain great numbers of very small, oval cells,    with thin cell walls and colorless contents. A careful examination    with a strong lens (magnifying from 500-1000 diameters) shows that    the protoplasm, in which are granules of varying size, does not fill    the cell completely, but that there are one or more large vacuoles    or spaces filled with colorless cell sap. No nucleus is visible in    the living cell, but it has been shown that a nucleus is present.      If growth is active, many of the cells will be seen dividing. The    process is somewhat different from ordinary fission and is called    budding (Fig. 37, _B_). A small protuberance appears at the bud or    at the side of the cell, and enlarges rapidly, assuming the form of    the mother cell, from which it becomes completely separated by the    constriction of the base, and may fall off at once, or, as is more    frequently the case, may remain attached for a time, giving rise    itself to other buds, so that not infrequently groups of half a    dozen or more cells are met with (Fig. 37, _B_, _C_).    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--_A_, single cells of yeast. _B_, _C_, similar  cells, showing the process of budding, x 750.]    That the yeast cells are the principal agents of alcoholic  fermentation may be shown in much the same way that bacteria are shown  to cause ordinary decomposition. Liquids from which they are excluded  will remain unfermented for an indefinite time.    There has been much controversy as to the systematic position of the  yeast fungi, which has not yet been satisfactorily settled, the  question being whether they are to be regarded as independent plants  or only one stage in the life history of some higher fungi (possibly  the _Smuts_), which through cultivation have lost the power of  developing further.      CLASS I.--THE SMUTS (_Ustillagineae_).    The smuts are common and often very destructive parasitic fungi,  living entirely within the tissues of the higher plants. Owing to  this, as well as to the excessively small spores and difficulty in  germinating them, the plants are very difficult of study, except in a  general way, and we will content ourselves with a glance at one of the  common forms, the corn smut (_Ustillago maydis_). This familiar fungus  attacks Indian corn, forming its spores in enormous quantities in  various parts of the diseased plant, but particularly in the flowers  (\"tassel\" and young ear).      The filaments, which resemble somewhat those of the white rusts,    penetrate all parts of the plant, and as the time approaches for the    formation of the spores, these branch extensively, and at the same    time become soft and mucilaginous (Fig. 38, _B_). The ends of these    short branches enlarge rapidly and become shut off by partitions,    and in each a globular spore (Fig. 38, _C_) is produced. The outer    wall is very dark-colored and provided with short spines. To study    the filaments and spore formation, very thin sections should be made    through the young kernels or other parts in the vicinity, before    they are noticeably distorted by the growth of the spore-bearing    filaments.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--_A_, \"tassel\" of corn attacked by smut  (_Ustillago_). _B_, filaments of the fungus from a thin section of a  diseased grain, showing the beginning of the formation of the spores,  x 300. _C_, ripe spores, x 300.]    As the spores are forming, an abnormal growth is set up in the cells  of the part attacked, which in consequence becomes enormously enlarged  (Fig. 38, _A_), single grains sometimes growing as large as a walnut.  As the spores ripen, the affected parts, which are at first white,  become a livid gray, due to the black spores shining through the  overlying white tissues. Finally the masses of spores burst through  the overlying cells, appearing like masses of soot, whence the popular  name for the plant.    The remaining _Mycomycetes_ are pretty readily divisible into two  great classes, based upon the arrangement of the spores. The first of  these is known as the _Ascomycetes_ (Sac fungi), the other the  _Basidiomycetes_ (mushrooms, puff-balls, etc.).      CLASS II.--_Ascomycetes_ (SAC FUNGI).    This class includes a very great number of common plants, all  resembling each other in producing spores in sacs (_asci_, sing.  _ascus_) that are usually oblong in shape, and each containing eight  spores, although the number is not always the same. Besides the spores  formed in these sacs (ascospores), there are other forms produced in  various ways.    There are two main divisions of the class, the first including only a  few forms, most of which are not likely to be met with by the student.  In these the spore sacs are borne directly upon the filaments without  any protective covering. The only form that is at all common is a  parasitic fungus (_Exoascus_) that attacks peach-trees, causing the  disease of the leaves known as \"curl.\"    All of the common _Ascomycetes_ belong to the second division, and  have the spore sacs contained in special structures called spore  fruits, that may reach a diameter of several centimetres in a few  cases, though ordinarily much smaller.    Among the simpler members of this group are the mildews  (_Perisporiaceae_), mostly parasitic forms, living upon the leaves and  stems of flowering plants, sometimes causing serious injury by their  depredations. They form white or grayish downy films on the surface of  the plant, in certain stages looking like hoar-frost. Being very  common, they may be readily obtained, and are easily studied. One of  the best species for study (_Podosphaera_) grows abundantly on the  leaves of the dandelion, especially when the plants are growing under  unfavorable conditions. The same species is also found on other plants  of the same family. It may be found at almost any time during the  summer; but for studying, the spore fruits material should be  collected in late summer or early autumn. It at first appears as  white, frost-like patches, growing dingier as it becomes older, and  careful scrutiny of the older specimens will show numerous brown or  blackish specks scattered over the patches. These are the spore  fruits.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--_A_, spore-bearing filaments of the dandelion  mildew (_Podosphaera_), x 150. _B_, a germinating spore, x 150. _C-F_,  development of the spore fruit, x 300. _ar._ archicarp. _G_, a ripe  spore fruit, x 150. _H_, the spore sac removed from the spore fruit,  x 150. _I_, spore-bearing filament attacked by another fungus  (_Cicinnobulus_), causing the enlargement of the basal cell, x 150.  _J_, a more advanced stage, x 300. _K_, spores, x 300.]      For microscopical study, fresh material may be used, or, if    necessary, dried specimens. The latter, before mounting, should be    soaked for a short time in water, to which has been added a few    drops of caustic-potash solution. This will remove the brittleness,    and swell up the dried filaments to their original proportions. A    portion of the plant should be carefully scraped off the leaf on    which it is growing, thoroughly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20394"],[0,"Correspondence Relating to Executions in Turkey for Apostacy from Islamism (#13)"],[1," in the end, though with much  reluctance. Nothing whatever has occurred to warrant the alarming  rumours of popular excitement and insurrection diligently  circulated, and even countenanced by Rifaat Pasha, some days ago. If  my information be correct, there is reason, on the contrary, to  believe that not only the Mussulman inhabitants of the capital are  sufficiently indifferent to the question at issue, but that many of  the upper classes, some of the most distinguished Turkish statesmen,  and a few even of the Ulemah are favourable to our view of the  subject.    Inclosure in No. 34.    _Answer of Rifaat Pasha to M. Frederic Pisani, March_ 14, 1844.    La réponse de son Excellence Rifaat Pacha, dite verbalement et  officiellement, se trouve dans une pièce qui nous a été présentée.  Cette pièce était un extrait d'une dépêche à Aali Effendi et à  Réchid Pacha. Nous avons refusé de la prendre parcequ'elle n'est pas  satisfaisante. Elle est conçue ainsi: \"Comme la loi ne permet  nullement de changer les dispositions à l'égard de la punition des  apostats, la Sublime Porte prendra des mesures efficaces, les  mesures possibles, pour que l'exécution des Chrétiens qui, devenus  Musulmans, retournent au Christianisme, n'ait pas lieu.\"    (Translation.)    The answer of his Excellency Rifaat Pasha, verbally and officially  pronounced, is contained in a document which was presented to us.  This document was an extract from a despatch to Aali Effendi and to  Reshid Pasha. We refused to take it, because it is not satisfactory.  It is couched in these terms: \"As the law does not admit of any  change being made in the enactments regarding the punishment of  apostates, the Sublime Porte will take efficacious measures, the  measures which are possible, in order that the execution of  Christians who, having become Mussulmans, return to Christianity,  shall not take place.\"              No. 35.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Stratford Canning_.    (Extract.)                        _Foreign Office, April_ 6, 1844.    The latest account which I have received from your Excellency of  your proceedings with regard to the question pending with the Porte,  arising out of the execution of the Greek near Brussa on the charge  of apostacy from Islamism, is contained in your despatch of the 14th  of March. From that despatch it appears that, in conjunction with  your French colleague, you had rejected as unsatisfactory the  communication made to your dragomans on that day by the Ministers of  the Porte, and that you were taking measures to secure an audience  of the Sultan, in the event of your failing to obtain from the Porte  without further delay, a more satisfactory reply.    On the statements in that despatch I have to acquaint your  Excellency that Her Majesty's Government concur with you in  considering that the communication made to you through your dragoman  on the 14th of March, was not of that absolute and unequivocal  character which you were instructed in my despatch of the 16th of  January to require from the Porte; and that you consequently acted  rightly in refusing to receive it, and in taking steps to obtain  either a more satisfactory communication from the Ministers of the  Porte, or admission to the presence of the Sultan for the purpose of  addressing to His Highness in person that appeal which you were  directed in case of necessity to make to him.    With regard, however, to the nature of the communication which Her  Majesty's Government would consider satisfactory, I have to state to  your Excellency that Her Majesty's Government are content to abide  by the terms which, it appears from your despatch of the 6th of  March, were suggested to Rifaat Pasha on the preceding day by your  Excellency and M. de Bourqueney, namely, that the Porte should make  \"an official declaration that effectual measures would be taken to  prevent the recurrence of executions for apostacy,\" or, as the  proposition has been reported by M. de Bourqueney to his Government,  \"that the Porte will take effectual measures to prevent the renewal  of executions similar to those which have recently taken place at  Constantinople and Biligik.\"    With such a declaration, officially made, Her Majesty's Government  would be perfectly satisfied, even without the additional clause  reported by your Excellency, which appears to them to be  unnecessary.    I need scarcely inform your Excellency that Her Majesty's Government  look with much anxiety to an early solution of this question. They  are sensible of the many inconveniences which the continued  agitation of it may involve, although it is with no small  satisfaction that they perceive from your Excellency's despatch that  there is no present appearance of the difficulties necessarily  attached to the question being increased by any insurrectionary or  fanatical movement on the part of the Mussulman inhabitants of the  Capital.    I have not yet received from the Turkish Ambassador in this country  any communication of the despatch from which the answer given to  your Excellency, through M. Pisani, appears to be an extract.    It is greatly to be desired that the Porte should act with  promptitude. Much of the embarrassment to which the agitation of  this question has given rise, may be traced to the attempt of the  Porte to invest it exclusively with a religious character.              No. 36.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received April_  10.)    (Extract.)                        _Constantinople, March_ 23, 1844.    I have the honour and satisfaction to inform your Lordship that the  question of religious executions is happily and, to all appearance,  conclusively settled. The concession has been obtained with great  difficulty; and, even to the last moment, it required the firmness  of resolution inspired by your Lordship's instruction to overcome  the obstacles which were raised against us, and to keep the Turkish  Ministers steady to their professions. I felt it to be my duty to  accept nothing short of your Lordship's requisition in its full  extent. But this obligation did not preclude me either from adopting  such means of success as were best calculated to hasten a favourable  result, or from accepting that result in a conciliatory though  effective shape. By availing myself of an overture to communicate  directly with the Sultan, I succeeded in obtaining all that was  necessary, and in receiving His Highness' acknowledgments for the  consideration I had shewn to his wishes.    These transactions have so little interest now, that it would be a  waste of your Lordship's time to enter upon a narration of them. It  may suffice for me to state that, after several unacceptable  propositions, the Porte's definitive reply was communicated to me  and to the French Minister in suitable terms, and also in writing,  which had been long refused; that to leave no doubt of what I  understand to be the meaning of the Porte, I sent in an  acknowledgment, of which a copy is herewith inclosed, together with  a translated copy of the Porte's declaration; and that to-day, at my  audience of the Sultan, His Highness not only confirmed what the  Porte had declared, but added, in frank and explicit language, the  assurances which I had previously required as to the general good  treatment of the Christians throughout his dominions. He, in fact,  gave me his royal word that, henceforward, neither should  Christianity be insulted in his dominions, nor should Christians be  in any way persecuted for their religion. Important as it was to  obtain this assurance from the lips of the Sovereign himself, I  should have thought it right to demand an audience for the mere  purpose of removing false impressions from His Highness' mind  respecting the motives and objects of Her Majesty's Government. In  this respect, also, I had every reason to be satisfied. The Sultan  expressed the strongest reliance on the friendly intentions of Great  Britain; he fully appreciated the motives which had actuated her on  the present occasion; he acknowledged more than once the signal and  frequent services rendered to his empire by British arms and  counsels; he declared that the great concession which he had now  confirmed, though entirely consonant with his own feelings, had been  made to his sense of obligation towards the British Government; he  called upon me to convey his thanks to Her Majesty for the good  treatment experienced by the millions of Mussulman subjects living  under British sway in India, and his anxious desire that the  engagements which he had taken to protect from violent and undue  interference the Christians established in his empire, should be  appreciated by Her Majesty's Government, and prove a source of  increased good-will between the two nations, and an occasion of  eliciting fresh proofs of friendly interest on the part of Great  Britain towards his dominions.    What passed at this audience is the more important and binding, as  it was one of a formal character, applied for on public grounds;  and, to give it still greater value, the Sultan, after I had retired  from his presence, called back the dragoman of the Porte, and  desired him to assure me that what he had said in public proceeded  from his real conviction, and was, in fact, the sincere expression  of his personal sentiments.    Inclosure 1 in No. 36.    _Official Declaration of the Sublime Porte, relinquishing the  practice of Executions for Apostacy_.    (Translation.)    It is the special and constant intention of His Highness the Sultan  that his cordial relations with the High Powers be preserved, and  that a perfect reciprocal friendship be maintained, and increased.    The Sublime Porte engages to take effectual measures to prevent  henceforward the execution and putting to death of the Christian who  is an apostate.    _March_ 21, 1844.
