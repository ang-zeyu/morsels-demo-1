[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#13)"],[1," Asia was fringed with islands  to the number of several thousands, and persuading himself that he was  among that cluster, he hoped soon to arrive at the dominion of the Grand  Khan.    The weather became unfavourable, adding greatly to the difficulties of  navigation.  These islands were generally uninhabited, but on the 22nd  of May he came to one to which he gave the name of Santa Marta.  Here  was a large village abandoned by its inhabitants.    Quantities of fish were found in their dwellings, as also domesticated  parrots, scarlet cranes, and some dumb dogs, which they fattened as an  article of food.  One day a number of natives were seen in a canoe,  occupied in fishing.  They employed a small fish, tied by the tail, the  flat head of which was furnished with numerous suckers, by which it  attached itself so firmly to any object as to be torn to pieces rather  than abandon its hold.  In this way the Spaniards witnessed the taking  of a tortoise of enormous size.  The same mode of fishing is said to be  employed on the eastern coast of Africa.  The natives led the Admiral to  suppose that the sea was full of islands south and west, and that Cuba  ran to the west without any termination.    Having extricated himself from this archipelago, Columbus steered for a  mountainous part of Cuba, and landing at a large village, he was  received with the same kindness which invariably distinguished its  inhabitants.  He found them mild, hospitable, and pacific; even the  animals were tamer as well as larger and better than those seen  elsewhere.  Here stock doves were brought to him, whose crops were found  to contain several spices.  The cacique told him that the name of his  province was Ornofay, and that farther on to the west was the province  of Mangon, whose inhabitants would give him more ample information.  He  was struck by the sound of the name.  It resembled that of Mangi, the  richest province of the Grand Khan bordering the ocean.  He understood  the Indians to say that it was inhabited by people who had tails, and  wore garments to conceal them.  He recollected that Sir John Mandeville  had recorded a story to the same effect as current among certain naked  tribes, who could not conceive that people would wear clothes unless to  conceal some defect.  He flattered himself, therefore, that he should  soon come to the rich province of Mangi and the long-robed inhabitants  of the empire of Tartary.  He therefore sailed on, animated by one of  the pleasing illusions of his imagination, along a coast where, for  thirty-five leagues, the navigation is unembarrassed by banks or  islands.  The shores were thickly populated.  As the vessels glided by,  the natives came off in their canoes to offer fruits and other  productions of the land.  Often too the sound of their loud music could  be heard, as they celebrated the arrival of the white men.    It is sad to think that this whole district was soon depopulated, the  simple inhabitants destroyed by the ruthless hand of the cruel and  bigoted Spaniard.  Again the vessels were entangled among sand-banks,  and the water appeared as white as milk.  This appearance was produced  by fine sand raised from the bottom by the agitation of the waves and  currents, but the seamen, unable to account for it, entreated that they  might return to the east.  Columbus, however, would not consent to  relinquish his voyage, believing, as he did, that he was on the eve of a  brilliant discovery.  The caravel was sent ahead to explore.  Only by  the greatest caution, toil, and peril did he succeed in making his way  through the narrow channels.    At length, with a fair wind, he steered towards some mountains seen  rising close to the coast, and came to an anchor near a beautiful grove  of palm-trees.  Here a party was sent on shore to obtain wood and water.  While they were thus employed an archer, who had gone into the forest  with his crossbow in search of game, came hurrying back, declaring that  he had seen, through an open glade, a man in a long white dress, two  others following in white tunics reaching to their knees, their  complexions as fair as those of Europeans.  Behind these appeared many  more, to the number of thirty, armed with clubs and lances.  They gave  no signs, he confessed, of hostile intentions, the man in the long white  dress alone advancing.    The watering party having no wish to encounter so many armed men,  hastened back to the ship.  Columbus, on hearing the story, was fully  persuaded that they were the clothed inhabitants of Mangon.    The following day he sent a strong force to penetrate into the interior.  They, however, found it impossible to get far on account of the matted  grass and creeping vegetation, and at length returned, wearied and  exhausted, to the ships.  The next day another party was dispatched, but  they came back, some declaring that they had seen the tracks of a lion,  others of a griffon.  Probably the marks were produced by alligators,  while the supposed white-robed natives were no doubt tall white cranes,  of which the bold archer had suddenly come in sight.  The only  inhabitants seen on the coast were perfectly naked.  Columbus attributed  this circumstance to their being mere fishermen, and supposed that the  civilised regions lay in the interior.    For several days Columbus continued exploring the coast, until he  perceived that it took a bend to the south-west.  This accorded with the  descriptions given by Marco Polo of the remote coasts of Asia.  He was  now sure that he was on that part of the Asiatic continent beyond the  limits of the Old World laid down by Ptolemy, and that by continuing his  course he should arrive at the point where this range of toast  terminated in the Aurea Chersonesus of the ancients.  Doubling this, he  would emerge into the seas bordered by the luxurious nations of the  East.  Stretching across the Gulf of the Ganges, he might continue on to  the Straits of Babel Mandel, and arrive on the shores of the Red Sea.  Thence he might make his way by land to Jerusalem, taking ship at Joppa,  and traverse the Mediterranean to Spain, or sail round the whole coast  of Africa, and thus circumnavigate the globe.    These notions, though not his enthusiasm, were shared by many of the  able navigators on board; but they considered the vessels, strained and  leaky, with rigging worn out, totally inadequate to the undertaking.  Of  this Columbus himself became convinced, and after exploring the coast  for four days longer, and finding it still trending to the south-west,  all declared that it was impossible so extensive a continuity of land  should belong to a mere island.    That no one might afterwards blame him for abandoning the enterprise, he  made each pilot and master sign a document expressing his opinion on the  subject, and as he had no other opportunity of verifying this idea, he  died in the belief that Cuba was the extremity of the Asiatic coast.    From this point, escaping numerous perils, he now again steered  eastward, until on the 7th of July he anchored in the mouth of a fine  river, intending to give the crews rest and recreation after their  confinement of two months on board.  He was here visited by the cacique  and his venerable minister of fourscore years, who brought a string of  beads, to which he attached a mystic value, and a calabash of a delicate  kind of fruit.  These he presented in token of amity.    The people also brought utias, large pigeons, bread, and rich fruits;  indeed, they and the chief cacique received him with mingled  demonstrations of joy and reverence.    In all remarkable places Columbus visited he erected crosses in  conspicuous situations.  Here a large one of wood was elevated on the  bank of a river.  Mass was then performed, and after it was concluded,  the old counsellor approached, and expressed his satisfaction that the  strangers thus gave thanks to God.    \"Be not vainglorious,\" he added, \"at all you have accomplished.  Know  that there are two places to which the souls of men go: the one dismal,  foul, and dark, prepared for those who have been unjust and cruel; the  other pleasant and full of delight for such as have promoted peace on  earth.  Beware, then, that you wrongfully hurt no man, and do no harm to  those who have done no harm to thee.\"    The Admiral, greatly moved, assured him that he rejoiced to hear his  doctrine respecting the future state, and told him that he had been sent  by his sovereigns to teach them the true religion, and to help them  subdue their enemies the cannibals, and therefore that all peaceable men  might look to him as their protector.    The old man then offered to embark with the Admiral, seized with a  desire to visit the wonderful country from which he and his followers  came, and only with great reluctance, moved by the lamentations of his  wife and children, would he abandon his project.    After remaining several days here, Columbus put to sea; but unable to  fetch Hispaniola, stood over to Jamaica, intending to finish its  circumnavigation.  The inhabitants came off, exhibiting the most  friendly disposition whenever the vessels neared the shore, and Diego  Colon, the interpreter, never failed to expatiate on the wonders he had  seen in Spain, and the prowess of the Spaniards who had defeated the  dreaded Caribs.    As the ships were one day standing along the coast under easy sail, with  a light wind, three canoes came off.  In the largest, handsomely carved  and painted, sat a cacique, his wife, two daughters, two sons, and his  five brothers.  One of the daughters, eighteen years of age, was  beautiful in form and countenance, and though destitute of clothing, was  of modest demeanour.  In the prow stood the standard-bearer, clad in a  mantle of variegated feathers, with a tuft of gay plumes on his head,  while he bore in his hand a fluttering white banner.  Two Indians, with  caps of feathers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#13)"],[1,"to speak in his own  defense.    When a man was accused of any wrongdoing, he was brought before this  jury, who sat under the open sky at night. No light was provided, and  the whole trial was carried on in the dark, so that the jury should not  be influenced by the good or bad looks of the prisoner, but should judge  merely from what was proved about him.    If the accused person was found guilty, he was also sentenced and  executed in the dark, so that the bright sun god, riding across the sky  in his golden chariot, should not be offended by the sad sight of a man  dying for his misdeeds.    Every citizen of Athens, whether rich or poor, was allowed to vote; and  as a salary was now paid to the men who helped govern the city, even a  man of small means, if elected to the Tribunal, could afford to give his  time to public duties.    By Solon's order the people were encouraged to talk matters over in  public in the market place; and, as the Athenians were fond of making  speeches, many of them became very eloquent.    Solon saw that his reforms were likely to work all the better if they  were fairly tried, and if he were not there to see how the people did.  He therefore made the Athenians promise to obey his laws for ten years,  and again set out on his travels.          XXXV. THE FIRST PLAYS.      In the days of Solon, men were often to be seen wandering around the  streets during the festival of Di-o-ny'sus, god of wine. They were clad  in goatskins, were smeared with the dregs of wine, and danced and sang  rude songs in honor of their god.    [Illustration: Theater of Dionysus.]    These songs were called tragedies, which in Greek means \"goat songs,\"  because the goat was sacred to the god whom they thus worshiped. The  people were greatly amused by the rude songs and dances of these  worshipers of Dionysus, and crowds gathered about them to listen to  their singing and to watch their antics.    Thes'pis, a Greek of great intelligence, noticed how popular these  amusements were, and to please the public taste he set up the first rude  theater. In the beginning it was only a few boards raised on trestles to  form a sort of stage in the open air; but Thespis soon built a booth, so  that the actors, when not on the stage, could be hidden from public  view.    The first plays, as already stated, were very simple, and consisted of  popular songs rudely acted. Little by little, however, the plays became  more and more elaborate, and the actors tried to represent some of the  tales which the story-tellers had told.    Some people did not approve of this kind of amusement; and among them  was Solon, who said that Thespis was teaching the Athenians to love a  lie, because they liked the plays, which, of course, were not true.    In spite of Solon's displeasure, the actors went on playing, and soon  the best poets began to write works for the stage. The actors became  more and more skillful, and had many spectators, although no women were  allowed on the stage, their parts being taken by men.    Finally, to make room for the ever-increasing number of theater goers, a  huge amphitheater was built. It was so large, we are told, that there  were seats for thirty thousand spectators. These seats were in  semicircular rows or tiers, of which there were one hundred, rising one  above another. The lowest row of all, near the orchestra, was composed  of sixty huge marble chairs. The amphitheater was open to the sky, the  stage alone being covered with a roof; and all the plays were given by  daylight. The ruins of this building, which is known as the Theater of  Dionysus, were dug out in 1862, and are now often visited by people who  go to Athens.    [Illustration: Sophocles.]    The Greek actors soon dressed in costume, and all wore masks expressing  the various emotions they wished to represent. The principal parts of  the play were recited; but from time to time singers came on the stage,  and chanted parts of the play in chorus.    Some of these plays were so sad that the whole audience was melted to  tears; others were so funny that the people shouted with laughter. When  you learn Greek, you will be able to read the grand tragedies which were  written by AEs'chy-lus, Soph'o-cles, and Eu-rip'i-des, and the comedies  or funny plays of Ar-is-toph'a-nes.          XXXVI. THE TYRANT PISISTRATUS.      Not very long after Solon had given the new laws to the Athenians, the  two political parties of the city again began to quarrel. One of these  parties was composed wholly of rich men and nobles, or _aristoi_, from  which Greek word is formed our English word \"aristocrat;\" the other  party included the farmers and poor people, or _demos_, the Greek term  which has given rise to the word \"democrat.\"    Among the aristocrats, or nobles, there was a nephew of Solon called  Pi-sis'tra-tus. He was very rich; but, instead of upholding his own  party, he seemed to scorn the rich, and always sided with the poor. To  make friends with the democrats, he pretended to obey the laws with the  greatest care, and addressed every man with the utmost politeness.    Once, having killed a man by accident, Pisistratus came of his own free  will before the judges of the Areopagus, confessed his crime, and was so  humble that he quite disarmed the anger of the people.    As soon as he felt quite sure that he had won many friends among the  poor, Pisistratus appeared one day in the market place, covered with  blood, which flowed from slight wounds which he had made upon his own  body.    His polite manners and kindly words had been only a pretense, however;  and he was not only a hypocrite, but also a liar. So he now said that  the aristocrats had tried to kill him because he was the friend of the  people.    In proof of these words, he pointed to his wounds. The poorer  Athenians, who believed him, were very indignant, and began to talk  angrily about the wicked nobles, who had hurt Pisistratus only because  he was ready to help them.    When Pisistratus cried out that his life was no longer safe, all the  democrats exclaimed that they would protect him; and, as they had the  right of voting, they then and there said that he should have a  bodyguard of fifty armed men to protect him.    Pisistratus pretended to be very grateful for this favor, and, under  pretext of choosing his bodyguard, engaged a great number of soldiers.  When his plans were all ready, he took possession of the Acropolis by  force.    The people now found out, but too late, that Pisistratus had deceived  them only to get more power; and that, thanks to the guard they had  voted him, he had become master of the town, and held the reins of the  government.    The Athenians did not long remain angry with their former favorite,  however; for he did all he could to make them happy, and ruled them very  wisely. He improved the city by building magnificent temples and other  public buildings, and made a great aqueduct, so that the people could  have plenty of pure water to drink.    Pisistratus also laid out a public park, the Ly-ce'um, just outside the  city walls, so that the Athenians could go there, and enjoy the cool  shade of the groves he had planted.    Then he began to collect all the poems of Homer, had them carefully  written down, and placed them in a public library, so that the Greeks  could read them whenever they pleased. Until then these poems had only  been recited, and no written copy existed. Pisistratus, therefore, did a  very good work in thus keeping for our enjoyment the greatest epic poems  ever composed.    As Pisistratus ruled just as he pleased, without consulting the Tribunal  or people, he has been called a tyrant. This word in those days meant  \"supreme ruler;\" but as many of those who followed him made a bad use of  their power, and were cruel and grasping, its meaning soon changed, and  the word now means \"a selfish and unkind ruler.\"          XXXVII. THE TYRANT'S INSULT.      While Pisistratus was thus governing Athens to suit himself, Solon was  traveling in Asia, where he met several interesting persons of whom you  will hear in ancient history.    Solon had gone away for ten years, hoping that the Athenians would  strictly obey his laws. During that time he had no news of his native  land; for there were no post offices or newspapers in those days, and  people neither wrote nor received letters except when something very  important happened.    On coming back to Athens, Solon was very sorry to learn that it was  Pisistratus, his own kinsman, who had taken the power of the archons;  but when he saw how wisely Pisistratus governed the people, and how  careful he was to make them happy and improve them, he freely forgave  him, and remained on good terms with him until he died.    Pisistratus went on ruling the Athenians for thirty-three years, and  when he died they mourned him greatly. In their grief for their loss,  they allowed his sons, Hip'-pi-as and Hip-par'chus, to succeed him,  without raising any objections.    These young men were very careful at first to follow their father's good  example; but they soon began to neglect business for pleasure, and,  instead of thinking of the people's good, they spent much of their time  in feasting and drinking.    In those days there dwelt at Athens two young men named Har-mo'di-us and  A-ris-to-gi'ton. They were intimate friends, and were loved by all on  account of their good qualities, and more especially because they were  so anxious to increase the glory and prosperity of their native city.    Harmodius had a sister who was as good as she was beautiful: so the  people, hoping to please him, chose her to carry a basket of flowers in  the great religious procession which took place in Athens every year.    One of the tyrants, Hipparchus, was very jealous of Harmodius, because  the people loved him so much. He therefore tried to annoy the young man  in every way; and when he heard that his"]]]
