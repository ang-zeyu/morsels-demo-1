You will note that  the wave length, which represents the distance between the dotted lines  A is much greater than E.    HEARING ELECTRICITY.--In electricity, mechanism has been made to enable  man to note the action of the current. By means of the armature,  vibrating in front of a magnet, we can see its manifestations. It is now  but a step to devise some means whereby we may hear it. In this, as in  everything else electrically, the magnet comes into play.    [Illustration: _Fig. 80._ THE MAGNETIC FIELD]    In the chapter on magnetism, it was stated that the magnetic field  extended out beyond the magnet, so that if we were able to see the  magnetism, the end of a magnet would appear to us something like a  moving field, represented by the dotted lines in Fig. 80.    The magnetic field is shown in Fig. 80 at only one end, but its  manifestations are alike at both ends. It will be seen that the magnetic  field extends out to a considerable distance and has quite a radius of  influence.    THE DIAPHRAGM IN A MAGNETIC FIELD.--If, now, we put a diaphragm (A) in  this magnetic field, close up to the end of the magnet, but not so close  as to touch it, and then push it in and out, or talk into it so that the  sound waves strike it, the movement or the vibration of the diaphragm  (A) will disturb the magnetic field emanating from the magnet, and this  disturbance of the magnetic field at one end of the magnet also affects  the magnetic field at the other end in the same way, so that the  disturbance there will be of the same amplitude. It will also display  the same characteristics as did the magnetic field when the diaphragm  (A) disturbed it.    A SIMPLE TELEPHONE CIRCUIT.--From this simple fact grew the telephone.  If two magnets are connected up in the same circuit, so that the  magnetic fields of the two magnets have the same source of electric  power, the disturbance of one diaphragm will affect the other similarly,  just the same as the two magnetic fields of the single magnet are  disturbed in unison.    HOW TO MAKE A TELEPHONE.--For experimental and testing purposes two of  these telephones should be made at the same time. The case or holder  (A) may be made either of hard wood or hard rubber, so that it is of  insulating material. The core (B) is of soft iron, 3/8 inch in diameter  and 5 inches long, bored and threaded at one end to receive a screw (C)  which passes through the end of the case (A).    The enlarged end of the case should be, exteriorly, 2-1/4 inches in  diameter, and the body of the case 1 inch in diameter.    [Illustration: _Fig. 81._ SECTION OF TELEPHONE RECEIVER]    Interiorly, the large end of the case is provided with a circular recess  1-3/4 inches in diameter and adapted to receive therein a spool which  is, diametrically, a little smaller than the recess. The spool fits  fairly tight upon the end of the core, and when in position rests  against an annular shoulder in the recess. A hollow space (F) is thus  provided behind the spool (D), so the two wires from the magnet may  have room where they emerge from the spool.    The spool is a little shorter than the distance between the shoulder (E)  and the end of the casing, at G, and the core projects only a short  distance beyond the end of the spool, so that when the diaphragm (H) is  put upon the end of the case, and held there by screws (I) it will not  touch the end of the core. A wooden or rubber mouthpiece (J) is then  turned up to fit over the end of the case.    [Illustration: _Fig. 82._ THE MAGNET AND RECEIVER HEAD]    The spool (D) is made of hard rubber, and is wound with No. 24  silk-covered wire, the windings to be well insulated from each other.  The two ends of the wire are brought out, and threaded through holes (K)  drilled longitudinally through the walls of the case, and affixed to the  end by means of screws (L), so that the two wires may be brought  together and connected with a duplex wire (M).    As the screw (C), which holds the core in place, has its head hidden  within a recess, which can be closed up by wax, the two terminals of the  wires are well separated so that short-circuiting cannot take place.    TELEPHONE CONNECTIONS.--The simplest form of telephone connection is  shown in Fig. 83. This has merely the two telephones (A and B), with a  single battery (C) to supply electricity for both. One line wire (D)  connects the two telephones directly, while the other line (E) has the  battery in its circuit.    [Illustration: _Fig. 83._ SIMPLE TELEPHONE CONNECTION]    COMPLETE INSTALLATION.--To install a more complete system requires, at  each end, a switch, a battery and an electro-magneto bell. You may use,  for this purpose, a bell, made as shown in the chapter on bells.    Fig. 84 shows such a circuit. We now dispense with one of the line  wires, because it has been found that the ground between the two  stations serves as a conductor, so that only one line wire (A) is  necessary to connect directly with the telephones of the two stations.  The telephones (B, B', respectively) have wires (C, C') running to the  pivots of double-throw switches (D, D'), one terminal of the switches  having wires (E, E'), which go to electric bells (F, F'), and from the  bells are other wires (G, G'), which go to the ground. The ground wires  also have wires (H, H'), which go to the other terminals of the switch  (D, D'). The double-throw switch (D, D'), in the two stations, is thrown  over so the current, if any should pass through, will go through the  bell to the ground, through the wires (E, G or E', G').    [Illustration: _Fig. 84._ TELEPHONE STATIONS IN CIRCUIT]    Now, supposing the switch (D'), in station 2, should be thrown over so  it contacts with the wire (H'). It is obvious that the current will then  flow from the battery (I') through wires (H', C') and line (A) to  station 1; then through wire C, switch D, wire E to the bell F, to the  ground through wire G. From wire G the current returns through the  ground to station 2, where it flows up wire G' to the battery, thereby  completing the circuit.    [Illustration: _Fig. 85._ ILLUSTRATING LIGHT CONTACT POINTS]    The operator at station 2, having given the signal, again throws his  switch (D') back to the position shown in Fig. 84, and the operator at  station 1 throws on his switch (D), so as to ring the bell in station 2,  thereby answering the signal, which means that both switches are again  to be thrown over so they contact with the battery wires (H and H'),  respectively. When both are thus thrown over, the bells (G, G') are cut  out of the circuit, and the batteries are both thrown in, so that the  telephones are now ready for talking purposes.    MICROPHONE.--Originally this form of telephone system was generally  employed, but it was found that for long distances a more sensitive  instrument was necessary.    LIGHT CONTACT POINTS.--In 1877 Professor Hughes discovered,  accidentally, that a light contact point in an electric circuit  augmented the sound in a telephone circuit. If, for instance, a light  pin, or a nail (A, Fig. 85) should be used to connect the severed ends  of a wire (B), the sounds in the telephone not only would be louder, but  they would be more distinct, and the first instrument made practically,  to demonstrate this, is shown in Fig. 86.    [Illustration: _Fig. 86._ MICROPHONE]    [Illustration: _Fig. 87._ TRANSMITTER]    HOW TO MAKE A MICROPHONE.--This instrument has simply a base (A) of  wood, and near one end is a perpendicular sounding-board (B) of wood, to  one side of which is attached, by wax or otherwise, a pair of carbon  blocks (C, D). The lower carbon block (C) has a cup-shaped depression in  its upper side, and the upper block has a similar depression in its  lower side. A carbon pencil (E) is lightly held within these cups, so  that the lightest contact of the upper end of the pencil with the  carbon block, makes the instrument so sensitive that a fly, walking upon  the sounding-board, may be distinctly heard through the telephone which  is in the circuit.    MICROPHONE THE FATHER OF THE TRANSMITTER.--This instrument has been  greatly modified, and is now used as a transmitter, the latter thereby  taking the place of the pin (A), shown in Fig. 85.    AUTOMATIC CUT-OUTS FOR TELEPHONES.--In the operation of the telephone,  the great drawback originally was in inducing users of the lines to  replace or adjust their instruments carefully. When switches were used,  they would forget to throw them back, and all sorts of trouble resulted.    It was found necessary to provide an automatic means for throwing in and  cutting out an instrument, this being done by hanging the telephone on  the hook, so that the act merely of leaving the telephone made it  necessary, in replacing the instrument, to cut out the apparatus.    Before describing the circuiting required for these improvements, we  show, in Fig. 87, a section of a transmitter.    A cup-shaped case (A) is provided, made of some insulating material,  which has a diaphragm (B) secured at its open side. This diaphragm  carries the carbon pencil (C) on one side and from the blocks which  support the carbon pencil the wires run to binding posts on the case.  Of course the carbon supporting posts must be insulated from each other,  so the current will go through the carbon pencil (C).    COMPLETE CIRCUITING WITH TRANSMITTER.--In showing the circuiting (Fig.  88) it will not be possible to illustrate the boxes, or casings, which  receive the various instruments. For instance, the hook which carries  the telephone or the receiver, is hinged within the transmitter box. The  circuiting is all that it is intended to show.    [Illustration: _Fig. 88._ COMPLETE TELEPHONIC CIRCUIT]    The batteries of the two stations are connected up by a wire (A), unless  a ground circuit is used. The other side of each battery has a wire  connection (B, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22771"],[0,"Cattle and Their Diseases (#13)"],[1,"produce wonderful  animals to look at, but neither useful nor profitable ones, and there is  danger of thus producing a most undesirable variation, since in animals  the process may be carried far enough to produce barrenness. Instances  are not wanting, particularly among the more recent improved  short-horns, of impotency among the males and of barrenness among the  females; and in some cases where the latter have borne calves, they have  failed to secrete sufficient milk for their nourishment. Impotency in  bulls of various breeds has, in many instances, occurred from too high  feeding, especially when connected with a lack of sufficient exercise. A  working bull, though perhaps not so pleasing to the eye as a fat one, is  a surer stock-getter; and his progeny is more likely to inherit full  health and vigor.    _Habit_ has a decided influence toward producing variations. We find in  domestic animals that use--or the demand created by habit--is met by a  development or change in the organization adapted to the requirement.  For instance, with cows in a state of nature, or where required only to  suckle their young, the supply of milk is barely fitted to the  requirement. If more is desired, and the milk is drawn completely and  regularly, the yield is increased and continued longer. By keeping up  the demand there is induced, in the next generation, a greater  development of the secreting organs, and more milk is given. By  continuing the practice, by furnishing the needful conditions of  suitable food and the like, and by selecting in each generation those  animals showing the greatest tendency toward milk, a breed specially  adapted for the dairy may be established. It is just by this mode that  the Ayrshires have, within the past century, been brought to be what  they are--a breed giving more good milk upon a certain amount of food  than any other.    [Illustration: READY FOR ACTION.]    It is a fact too well established to be controverted, that the first  male produces impressions upon subsequent progeny by other males. To  what extent this principle holds, it is impossible to say. Although the  instances in which it is known to be of a very marked and obvious  character may be comparatively few, yet there is ample reason to  believe that, although in a majority of cases the effect may be less  noticeable, it is not less real; and it therefore demands the special  attention of breeders. The knowledge of this law furnishes a clue to the  cause of many of the disappointments of which practical breeders often  complain, and of many variations otherwise unaccountable, and it  suggests particular caution as to the first male employed in the  coupling of animals--a matter which has often been deemed of little  consequence in regard to cattle, inasmuch as fewer heifers' first calves  are reared, than those are which are borne subsequently.    The phenomenon--or law, as it is sometimes called--of atavism, or  _ancestral influence_, is one of considerable practical importance, and  well deserves the careful attention of the breeder of farm stock.    Every one is aware that it is by no means unusual for a child to  resemble its grandfather, or grandmother, or even some ancestor still  more remote, more than it does either its own father or mother. The same  occurrence is found among our domestic animals, and oftener in  proportion as the breeds are crossed or mixed up. Among our common stock  of neat cattle, or natives--originating, as they did, from animals  brought from England, Scotland, Denmark, France, and Spain, each  possessing different characteristics of form, color, and use, and bred,  as our common stock has usually been, indiscriminately together, with no  special object in view, with no attempt to obtain any particular type or  form, or to secure adaptation for any particular purpose--frequent  opportunities are afforded of witnessing the results of this law of  hereditary transmission. So common, indeed, is its occurrence, that the  remark is often made, that, however good a cow may be, there is no  telling beforehand what sort of a calf she may have. The fact is  sufficiently obvious, that certain peculiarities often lie dormant for a  generation or two and then reappear in subsequent progeny. Stockmen  often speak of it as \"breeding back,\" or \"crying back.\"    The lesson taught by this law is very plain. It shows the importance of  seeking thorough-bred or well-bred animals; and by these terms are  simply meant such as are descended from a line of ancestors in which for  many generations the desirable forms, qualities, and characteristics  have been _uniformly shown_. In such a case, even if ancestral influence  does come in play, no material difference appears in the offspring, the  ancestors being all essentially alike. From this standpoint we best  perceive in what consists the money value of a good \"pedigree.\" This is  valuable, in proportion as it shows an animal to be descended, not only  from such as are purely of its own race or breed, but also from such  individuals of that breed as were specially noted for the excellencies  for which that particular breed is esteemed.    Probably the most distinctly marked evidence of ancestral influence  among us, is to be found in the ill-begotten, round-headed calves, not  infrequently dropped by cows of the common mixed kind, which, if killed  early, make very blue veal, and if allowed to grow up, become  exceedingly profitless and unsatisfactory beasts; the heifers being  often barren, the cows poor milkers, the oxen dull, mulish beasts,  yielding flesh of very dark color, of ill flavor and destitute of fat.    _The relative influence_ of the male and female parents upon the  characteristics of progeny has long been a fruitful subject of  discussion among breeders. It is found in experience that progeny  sometimes resembles one parent more than the other--sometimes there is  an apparent blending of the characteristics of both--sometimes a  noticeable dissimilarity to either, though always more or less  resemblance somewhere--and sometimes the impress of one may be seen upon  a portion of the organization of the offspring, and that of the other  parent upon another portion; yet we are not authorized from such  discrepancies to conclude that it is a matter of chance; for all of  nature's operations are conducted in accordance with fixed laws, whether  we be able fully to discover them or not. The same causes always produce  the same results. In this case, not less than in others, there are,  beyond all doubt, certain fixed laws; and the varying results which we  see are easily and sufficiently accounted for by the existence of  conditions or modifying influences not fully open to our observation.    It may be stated, on the whole--as a result of the varied investigations  to which this question has given rise--that the evidence, both from  observation and the testimony of the best practical breeders, goes to  show that each parent usually contributes certain portions of the  organization to the offspring, and that each has a modifying influence  upon the other. Facts also show that the same parent does not always  contribute the same portions, but that the order is at times, and not  rarely, reversed. Where animals are of distinct species or breeds,  transmission is usually found to be in harmony with the principle, that  the male gives mostly the outward form and locomotive system, and the  female chiefly the interior system, constitution and the like. Where  the parents are of the same breed, it appears that the proportions  contributed by each are governed, in a large measure, by the condition  of each in regard to age and vigor, or by virtue of individual potency  or superiority of physical endowment. This potency or power of  transmission, seems to be legitimately connected with high breeding, or  the concentration of fixed qualities, obtained by continued descent for  many generations from such only as possess in the highest degree the  qualities desired.    Practically, the knowledge obtained dictates in a most emphatic manner  that every stock-grower use his utmost endeavor to obtain the services  of the best sires; that is, the best for the ends and purposes in  view--that he depend chiefly on the sire for outward form and  symmetry--and that he select dams best calculated to develop the good  qualities of the male, depending chiefly upon these for freedom, from  internal disease, for hardihood and constitution, and, generally, for  all qualities dependent upon the vital or nutritive system. The neglect  of the qualities of the dam, which is far too common--miserably old and  inferior animals being often employed--cannot be too strongly censured.    With regard to the laws which regulate the sex of the progeny very  little is known. Many and extensive observations have been made, without  reaching any definite conclusion. Nature seems to have provided that the  number of each sex; produced, shall be nearly equal; but by what means  this result is attained, has not as yet been discovered.    It has long been a disputed point, whether the system of _breeding  in-and-in_, or the opposite one of frequent crossing, has the greater  tendency to improve the character of stock This term, in-and-in, is  often very loosely used and as variously understood. Some confine the  phrase to the coupling of those of exactly the same blood, as brothers  and sisters, while others include in it breeding from parents and  offsprings; and others still employ it to embrace those of a more  distant relationship. For the last, the term breeding-in, or close  breeding, is generally deemed more suitable.    The current opinion is decidedly against the practice of breeding from  any near relatives; it being usually found that degeneracy follows, and  often to a serious degree; but it is not proved that this degeneracy,  although very common and even usual, is yet a"]]]
