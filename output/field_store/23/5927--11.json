Of this kind was the general evidence of the  witnesses examined. Less incredible, perhaps, is the statement  that they sometimes saw demons in the appearance of women; and a  more credible allegation is that of a secret understanding with  the Turks.    Notoriously suspicious communication had been maintained with the  enemy; they even went so far as to adopt their style of dress and  living. Worse than all, by an amiable but unaccustomed tolerance,  the followers of Mohammed had been allowed a free exercise of  their religion, a sort of liberality little short of apostasy  from the faith. Without recounting all the horrors of the  persecution, it must be sufficient to repeat that fifty-four  of the wretched condemned, having been degraded by the Bishop  of Paris, were handed over to the flames. Four years afterwards  the scene was consummated by the burning of Jacques Molay.  Torture of the most dreadful sort had been applied to force  necessary confessions; and the complaint of one of the criminals  is significant--'I, single, as I am, cannot undertake to argue  with the Pope and the King of France.'[60] In attempting to  detect the mysterious facts of this dark transaction little  assistance is given by the contradictory statements of cotemporary  or later writers; some asserting the charges to be mere  fabrications throughout; others their positive reality; and recent  historians have attempted to substantiate or destroy them. Hallam  truly remarks that the rapacious and unprincipled conduct of  Philip, the submission of Clement V. to his will, the apparent  incredibility of the charges from their monstrousness, the just  prejudice against confessions obtained by torture and retracted  afterwards; the other prejudice, not always so just, but in the  case of those not convicted on fair evidence deserving a better  name, in favour of assertions of innocence made on the scaffold  and at the stake, created, as they still preserve, a strong  willingness to disbelieve the accusations which come so  suspiciously before us.[61] An approximation to the truth may  be obtained if, rejecting as improbable the accusations of  devil-worship and its concomitant rites which, invented to  amuse the vulgar, characterise the proceedings, we admit the  _probability_ of a secret understanding with the Turks, or the  _possibility_ of infidelity to the religion of Christ. Their  destruction had been predetermined; the slender element of truth  might soon be exaggerated and confounded with every kind of  fiction. Their pride, avarice, luxury, corrupt morals, would give  colour to the most absurd inventions.[62]      [60] Michelet's _History of France_, book v. 4. M. Michelet    suggests an ingenious explanation of some of their supposed    secret practices. 'The principal charge, the denial of the    Saviour, rested on an equivocation. The Templars might    confess to the denial without being in reality apostates.    Many averred that it was a symbolical denial, in imitation    of St. Peter's--one of those pious comedies in which the    antique Church enveloped the most serious acts of religion,    but whose traditional meaning was beginning to be lost in    the fourteenth century.' The idol-head, believed to    represent Mohammed or the devil, he supposes to have been 'a    representation of the Paraclete, whose festival, that of    Pentecost, was the highest solemnity of the Temple.' Some    have identified them, like those of the Albigenses or    Waldenses, with the ceremonies of the Gnostics.      [61] _View of the Middle Ages_, chap. i. The judicial    impartiality (eulogised by Macaulay) and patient    investigation of truth (the first merits of a historian) of    the author of the _Constitutional History of England_, might    almost entitle him to rank with the first of historians,    Gibbon.      [62] The alliance of the Church--of the Dominican Order in    particular--with the secular power against its once foremost    champions, is paralleled and explained by the causes that led    to the dissolution of the Order of Jesus by Clement XIV. in    the eighteenth century--fear and jealousy.    If the history of the extermination of the Templars exemplifies  in an eminent manner the political uses made by the highest in  office of a prevalent superstition, the story of Alice Kyteler  illustrates equally the manner in which it was prostituted to the  private purposes of designing impostors. The scene is in Ireland,  the period the first half of the fourteenth century; Richard de  Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory, being the principal prosecutor, and a  lady, Alice Kyteler, the defendant. The details are too tedious  to be repeated here;[63] but the articles upon which the  conviction of Alice Kyteler and her accomplices was sought are  not dissimilar to those just narrated. To give effect to their  sorcery they were in the habit of denying the faith for a year,  or shorter period, as the object to be attained was greater or  less. Demons were propitiated with sacrifices of living animals,  torn limb by limb and scattered (a Hecatean feast) about  cross-roads. It was alleged that by sorceries they obtained help  from the devil; that they impiously used the ceremonies of the  Church in nightly conventicles, pronouncing with lighted candles  of wax excommunication against the persons of their own husbands,  naming expressly every member from the sole of the foot to the  top of the head. Their compositions are of the Horatian and  Shakspearian sort. With the intestines of cocks were sacrificed  various herbs, the nails of dead men, hair, brains, and clothes  of children dying unbaptized, with other equally efficacious  ingredients, boiled in the skull of a certain famous robber  recently beheaded: powders, ointments, and candles of fat boiled  in the same skull were the intended instruments for exciting love  or hatred, and in affecting the bodies of the faithful. An unholy  connection existed between the Lady Alice and a demon in the form  sometimes of a black dog, sometimes of a cat. She was possessed  of a secret ointment for impregnating a piece of wood, upon  which, with her companions, she was carried to any part of the  world without hurt or hindrance: in her house was found a wafer  of consecrated bread inscribed with the name of the devil. The  event of this trial was the conviction and imprisonment of the  criminals, with the important exception of the chief object of  the bishop's persecution, who contrived an escape to England.  Petronilla de Meath was the first to suffer the extreme penalty.  This lady, by order of the bishop, had been six times flogged,  when, to escape a repetition of that barbarous infliction, she  made a public confession involving her fellow-prisoners. After  which Petronilla was carried out into the city and burned before  all the people--the first witch, it is said, ever burned in  Ireland. Of the other accused all were treated with more or less  severity; two were subsequently burned, some were publicly  flogged in the market-place and through the city, others  banished; a few, more fortunate, escaping altogether.      [63] They are given in full in _Narratives of Sorcery and    Magic from the most Authentic Sources_, by Thomas Wright. In    the _Annals of Ireland_, affixed to Camden's _Britannia_,    ed. 1695, sub anno 1325 A.D., the case of Dame Alice Ketyll    is briefly chronicled. Being cited and examined by the    Bishop of Ossory, it was discovered, among other things,    'That a certain spirit called Robin Artysson lay with her;    and that she offered him nine red cocks on a stone bridge    where the highway branches out into four several parts.    _Item_: That she swept the streets of Kilkenny with besoms    between Compline and Courefeu, and in sweeping the filth    towards the house of William Utlaw, her son, by way of    conjuring, wished that all the wealth of Kilkenny might flow    thither. The accomplices of this Alice in these devilish    practices were Pernil of Meth, and Basilia the daughter of    this Pernil. Alice, being found guilty, was fined by the    bishop, and forced to abjure her sorcery and witchcraft. But    being again convicted of the same practice, she made her    escape with Basilia, and was never found. But Pernil was    burnt at Kilkenny, and before her death declared that    William above-said deserved punishment as well as she--that    for a year and a day he wore the devil's girdle about his    bare body,' &c.          CHAPTER III.         Witchcraft and Heresy purposely confounded by the       Church--Mediaeval Science closely connected with Magic and       Sorcery--Ignorance of Physiology the Cause of many of the       Popular Prejudices--Jeanne d'Arc--Duchess of       Gloucester--Jane Shore--Persecution at Arras.      What can hardly fail to be discerned in these prosecutions is the  confusion of heresy and sorcery industriously created by the  orthodox Church to secure the punishment of her offending  dissentients. There are few proceedings against the pretended  criminals in which it is not discoverable; the one crime being,  as a matter of course, the necessary consequence of the other. In  the interest of the Church as much as in the credulity of the  people must be sought the main cause of so violent an epidemic,  of so fearful a phenomenon in its continuance and atrocities, a  fact demonstrated by the whole course of the superstition in the  old times of Catholicism. Materials for exciting animosity and  indignation against suspected heretics were near at hand. In  the assurance of the pre-scientific world everything remote  from ordinary knowledge or experience was inseparable from  supernaturalism. What surpassed the limits of a very feeble  understanding, what was beyond the commonest experience of  every-day life, was with one accord relegated to the domain of  the supernatural, or rather "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#13)"],[1,"r: In the first place those ingredients containing a  noticeable amount of protein are carefully weighed. Food tables are then  consulted to discover the protein percentage. Suppose, for instance, the  only ingredient having a noticeable quantity of protein is rice, and 1  lb. is used. The table is consulted and shows rice to contain eight per  cent. protein. In 1 lb. avoirdupois there are 7,000 grains; eight per  cent. of 7,000 is 70.00 x 8 = 560 grains. Therefore, in the dish  prepared there are 560 grains of protein. It is as well after cooking to  weight the entree or pudding and divide the number of ounces it weighs  into 560, thus obtaining the number of grains per ounce. Weighing out  food at meals is only necessary at first, say for the first week or so.  Having decided about how many grains of protein to have daily, and  knowing how many grains per ounce the food contains, the eye will soon  get trained to estimate the quantity needed. It is not necessary to be  exact; a rough approximation is all that is needed, so as to be sure  that the system is getting somewhere near the required amount of  nutriment, and not suffering from either a large excess or deficiency of  protein.

P. O., Washington, D. C.]          III    WHEN TO EAT      The question of when to eat is of some importance. The Orientals eat  fewer meals than we do, and in their abstemiousness they set us an  example we should do well to follow. Sufficient has already been said to  show that it is a mistake to imagine a great deal of food gives great  strength. When we eat frequently, and especially when we 'live well,'  that is, are accustomed to a large variety of food, we are tempted to  eat far more than is good for us. Little and often may work  satisfactorily so long as it does not develop into much and often,  which, needless to say, it is very likely to do. Most people on this  account would probably be much better in their health if they ate but  twice daily, at noon, and five or six hours before going to bed. Then  there is less chance of over-feeding. If, however, we experimentally  determine the quantity of food that our particular system requires in  order to be maintained in good health, and can trust our self-command in  controlling the indulgence of sense, probably the best method is to eat  anyway three times daily, and four, five, or even six times, or doing  away with set meals altogether, would be a procedure which, judging  from analogy of the anthropoids, ought to be a better method than eating  a whole day's supply at once, or at two or three meals.    It is not wise to sit down to a meal when the body is thoroughly  fatigued. A glass of hot or cold water will be found reviving, and then,  after a short rest, the system will be far better able to assimilate  food. When the body is 'tired out,' it stands to reason it cannot  perform digestion as easily and as well as when in fit condition.    Also it is unwise to eat immediately before undertaking vigorous  muscular work. Strenuous exercise after meals is often the cause of  digestive disorders. Starting on exercise after a hearty meal may  suspend the gastric digestion, and so prevent the assimilation of  protein as to produce a sensation of exhaustion. If, however, rest is  taken, the digestive organs proceed with their work, and after a short  time recuperation follows, and the exercise can be continued. It is  unwise to allow such a suspension of digestion because of the danger of  setting up fermentation, or putrefaction, in the food mass awaiting  digestion, for this may result in various disorders.    For the same reason it is a bad plan to eat late at night. It is unwise  to take a meal just before going to bed, for the digestive organs cannot  do their work properly, if at all, while the body is asleep, and the  food not being digested is liable to ferment and result in dyspepsia.  The 'sinking feeling' sometimes complained of if a meal is not eaten  late at night and described as a kind of hunger is probably due to an  abnormal secretion of acid in the stomach. A glass of hot water will  often relieve this discomfort. This feeling is seldom experienced by  vegetarians of long standing. The natives of India, it is said, do not  experience it at all, which fact leads us to surmise the cause to be in  some way connected with flesh-eating. Farinaceous foods, however,  prepared as soup, porridge, gruel, pultaceous puddings, etc., when  eaten, as is customary, without proper insalivation, are liable to be  improperly digested and to ferment, giving rise to the sensation  described as a 'sinking feeling' and erroneously thought to be hunger.    It is an excellent rule that prescribes fasting when without hunger.  When there is no appetite do not eat. It is an example of conventional  stupidity that we eat because it is 'meal time,' even though there be  not the slightest feeling of genuine hunger. Leaving out of  consideration the necessitous poor and those who for their living engage  themselves in hard physical toil, it is safe to say that hardly one  person in a thousand has ever felt real hunger. Yet no one was ever the  worse for waiting upon appetite. No one was ever starved by not eating  because of having no appetite. Loss of appetite is a sign that the  digestive organs require a rest. It is better to go without food for a  time than to force oneself to eat against inclination. The forcing of  oneself to eat to 'keep up one's strength,' is perhaps the quickest way  to bring down one's strength by overworking the system and burdening it  with material it does not need. Eat by appetite, not by time. Eat  frequently when the appetite demands frequent satisfaction, and seldom  when seldom hungry. These rules hold good at all times and for everyone.  Loss of appetite during sickness should not be looked upon as anything  serious in itself, but as a sign that the system does not require food.  A sick man like a well man will feel hunger as soon as food is needed,  and the practice of tempting the appetite with rich and costly foods is  not only a waste of money but is injurious physiologically. Possibly  there may be pathological conditions under which hunger cannot make  itself felt, but it would seem contrary to Nature as far as the writer,  a layman, understands the matter. At least, leaving abnormal conditions  of health out of consideration, we can say this much affirmatively: if a  man is hungry enough to relish dry bread, then, and then only, does he  really require nourishment.    Hunger is always experienced when nutriment is needed, and will be felt  a dozen times a day if the food eaten at each of a dozen meals has  supplied only sufficient nutriment to produce the force expended between  each meal. If the meal is large and supplies sufficient nutriment to  produce the force expended in a whole day, then the one meal is all that  is required. Never eat to be sociable, or conventional, or sensual; eat  when hungry.    Professor Pavlov says: 'Appetite is juice'; that is to say, the  physiological condition existing when the body has run short of  food-fuel, produces a psychological effect, the mind thinking of food,  thereby causing through reaction a profuse secretion of saliva, and we  say 'the mouth waters.' It is true the appetite is amenable to  suggestion. Thus, though feeling hunger, the smell of, or even thought  of, decayed food may completely take away appetite and all inclination  to eat. This phenomenon is a provision of Nature to protect us from  eating impure food. The appetite having thus been taken away will soon  return again when the cause of its loss has been removed. Therefore the  appetite should be an infallible guide when to eat.    There is one further point to be noted. Food should not be eaten when  under the influence of strong emotion. It is true that under such  conditions there probably would be no appetite, but when we are so  accustomed to consulting the clock that there is danger of cozening  ourselves into the belief that we have an appetite when we have not, and  so force ourselves to eat when it may be unwise to do so. Strong  emotions, as anger, fear, worry, grief, judging by analogy, doubtless  inhibit digestive activity. W. B. Cannon, M.D., speaking of experiments  on cats, says: 'The stomach movements are inhibited whenever the cat  shows signs of anxiety, rage, or distress.' To thoroughly enjoy one's  food, it is necessary to have hunger for it, and if we only eat when we  feel hungry, there is little likelihood of ever suffering from  dyspepsia.    In passing, it is appropriate to point out that as when food is better  enjoyed it is better digested, therefore art, environment, mental  disposition, indirectly affect the digestive processes. We should,  therefore, remembering that simplicity, not complexity, is the essence  of beauty, ornament our food and table, and be as cheerful, sociable,  and even as merry as possible.          IV    HOW TO EAT      The importance of thorough mastication and insalivation cannot be  overestimated. The mouth is a part of the digestive apparatus, and in it  food is not only broken down, but is chemically changed by the action of  the saliva. If buccal (mouth) digestion be neglected, the consequence is  that the food passes into the stomach in a condition that renders it  difficult for that organ to digest it and any of a great number of  disturbances may result.    Mastication means a thorough breaking up of the food into the smallest  particles, and insalivation means the mixing of the small particles with  the saliva. The mechanical work is done with the jaws and tongue, and  the chemical work is performed by the saliva. When the mechanical"]]]
