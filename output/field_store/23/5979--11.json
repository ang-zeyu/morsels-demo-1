In this sermon, not only was  the status of the Church of England claimed as the Established Church of  the Empire, and exclusively entitled to the Clergy Reserves, or one  seventh of the lands of Upper Canada, but an appeal was made to the  Imperial Government and Parliament for a grant of L300,000 per annum, to  enable the Church of England in Upper Canada, to maintain the loyalty of  Upper Canada to England. And these statements and appeals were made ten  years after the close of the war of 1812-1815, by the United States  against Britain, with the express view of conquering Canada and annexing  it to the United States; and during which war both Methodist preachers  and people were conspicuous for their loyalty and zeal in defence of the  country.    The Methodists in York (now Toronto) at that time (1826) numbered about  fifty persons, young and old; the two preachers arranged to meet once in  four weeks on their return from their country tours, when a social  meeting of the leading members of the society was held for conversation,  consultation, and prayer. One of the members of this company obtained  and brought to the meeting a copy of the Archdeacon's sermon, and read  the parts of it which related to the attacks upon the Methodists, and  the proposed method of exterminating them. The reading of those extracts  produced a thrilling sensation of indignation and alarm, and all agreed  that something must be written and done to defend the character and  rights of Methodists and others assailed, against such attacks and such  a policy. The voice of the meeting pointed to me to undertake this work.  I was then designated as \"The Boy Preacher,\" from my youthful  appearance, and as the youngest minister in the Church. I objected on  account of my youth and incompetence; but my objections were overruled,  when I proposed as a compromise, that during our next country tour the  Superintendent of the Circuit (Rev. James Richardson), and myself should  each write on the subject, and from what we should both write,  something might be compiled to meet the case. This was agreed to, and  at our next social monthly meeting in the town, inquiry was made as to  what had been written in defence of the Methodists and others, against  the attacks and policy of the Archdeacon of York. It was found that the  Superintendent of the Circuit had written nothing; and on my being  questioned, I said I had endeavoured to obey the instructions of my  senior brethren. It was then insisted that I must read what I had  written. I at length yielded, and read my answer to the attacks made on  us. The reading of my paper was attended with alternate laughter and  tears on the part of those present, all of whom insisted that it should  be printed, I objecting that I had never written anything for the press,  and was not competent to such a task, and advanced to throw my  manuscript into the fire, when one of the elder members caught me by the  arms, and another wrenched the manuscript out of my hands, saying he  would take it to the printer. Finding my efforts vain to recover it, I  said if it were restored I would not destroy it but rewrite it and  return it to the brethren to do what they pleased with it. I did so. Two  of the senior brethren took the manuscript to the printer, and its  publication produced a sensation scarcely less violent and general than  a Fenian invasion. It is said that before every house in Toronto might  be seen groups reading and discussing the paper on the evening of its  publication in June; and the excitement spread throughout the country.  It was the first defiant defence of the Methodists, and of the equal and  civil rights of all religious persuasions; the first protest and  argument on legal and British constitutional grounds, against the  erection of a dominant church establishment supported by the state in  Upper Canada.    It was the Loyalists of America, and their descendants, in Upper Canada  who first lifted up the voice of remonstrance against ecclesiastical  despotism in the province, and unfurled the flag of equal religious  rights and liberty for all religious persuasions.    The sermon of the Archdeacon of York was the third formal attack made by  the Church of England clergy upon the characters of their unoffending  Methodist brethren and those of other religious persuasions; but no  defence of the assailed parties had as yet been written. In a subsequent  discussion on another topic, referring to this matter, I said:         \"Up to this time not a word had been written respecting the clergy       of the Church of England, or the Clergy Reserve question, by any       minister or member of the Methodist Church. At that time the       Methodists had no law to secure a foot of land, on which to build       parsonages, Chapels, and in which to bury their dead; their       ministers were not allowed to solemnize matrimony; and some of       them had been the objects of cruel and illegal persecution on the       part of magistrates and others in authority. And now they were the       butt of unprovoked and unfounded aspersions from two heads of       Episcopal Clergy, while pursuing the 'noiseless tenor of their       way,' through trackless forests and bridgeless rivers and streams,       to preach among the scattered inhabitants the unsearchable riches       of Christ.\"[7]    _The Review_, in defence of the Methodists and others against such  gratuitous and unjust imputations, consisted of about thirty octavo  pages, appeared over the signature of \"A Methodist Preacher;\" it was  commenced near Newmarket, in a cottage owned by the late Mr. Elias  Smith, whose wife was a sister of the Lounts--a woman of great  excellence. It was written piecemeal in the humble residences of the  early settlers, in the course of eight days, during which time I rode on  horseback nearly a hundred miles and preached seven sermons. On its  publication I pursued my country tour of preaching, &c., little  conscious of the storm that was brewing; but on my return to town, at  the end of two weeks, I received newspapers containing four replies to  my _Review_--three of them written by clergymen, and one by a scholarly  layman of the Church of England. In those replies to the then unknown  author of the _Review_, I was assailed by all sorts of contemptuous and  criminating epithets--all denying that the author of such a publication  could be \"a Methodist Preacher,\"--but was \"an American,\" \"a rebel,\" \"a  traitor,\"--and that the _Review_ was the \"prodigious effort of a party.\"    My agitation was extreme; finding myself, against my own intention and  will, in the very tempest of a discussion for which I felt myself poorly  prepared, I had little appetite or sleep. At length roused to a sense of  my position, I felt that I must either flee or fight. I decided upon the  latter, strengthened by the consciousness that my principles were those  of the British Constitution and in defence of British rights. I devoted  a day to fasting and prayer, and then went at my adversaries in good  earnest. In less than four years after the commencement of this  controversy, laws were passed authorising the different religious  denominations to hold land for churches, parsonages, and burying  grounds, and their Ministers to solemnize matrimony; while the  Legislative Assembly passed, by large majorities, resolutions, and  addresses to the Crown against the exclusive pretensions of the Church  of England to the Clergy Reserves and being the exclusive established  Church of Upper Canada, though the Clergy Reserve question itself  continued to be discussed, and was not finally settled until more than  ten years afterwards.    Several months after the commencement of this controversy I paid my  first annual visit to my parents, and for the first two days the burden  of my Father's conversation was this controversy which was agitating the  country. At length, while walking in the orchard, my Father turned  short, and in a stern tone, said, \"Egerton, they say that you are the  author of these papers which are convulsing the whole country. I want to  know whether you are or not?\" I was compelled to acknowledge that I was  the writer of these papers, when my Father lifted up his hands, in an  agony of feeling, and exclaimed, \"My God! we are all ruined!\"    The state of my own mind and the character of my labours during this  first year of my ministry, may be inferred from the following brief  extracts from my diary:--         _October 4th_,--I have this evening arrived on my Circuit at York.       I feel the change to be awfully important, and entirely inadequate       to give proper instruction to so intelligent a people. The Lord       give me his assisting grace. I am resolved to devote my time, my       heart, my all, to God without reserve. I do feel determined, by       God's assistance, to rise early, spend no more time than is       absolutely necessary, pray oftener, and more fervently, to be       modest and solemn in the discharge of my public duties--to improve       every leisure moment by reading or meditation, and to depend upon       the assistance of Almighty God for the performance of every duty.       Oh, Lord, assist an ignorant youth to declare thy great salvation!         _Oct. 9th._--Commenced my labours this day. In the morning, the       Lord was very near to help me, giving me a tongue to speak, and a       heart to feel. But in the evening, after I got through my       introduction, recollection failed and my mind was entirely blank.       For nearly five minutes I could scarcely speak a word; after this       my thoughts returned. This seemed to be the hand of God, to show me       my entire weakness.         _Oct. 16th--Sabbath._--Oh, God, water the efforts of this day with       thy grace! If I am the means of persuading only one soul to embrace       the Lord Jesus, I shall be amply rewarded. \"Paul "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#13)"],[1,"  propose a question.\"    \"First of all, tell me why you came hither,\" interrupted Mustapha,  full of resentment at finding himself detected.    \"That I will explain to you,\" rejoined the other: \"I could not put up  with the Mighty any longer, and therefore ran away; but you, Mustapha,  were properly the cause of our quarrel, and so you must give me your  sister to wife, and I will help you in your flight; give her not, and  I will go to my new master, and tell him something of our new Bashaw.\"    Mustapha was beside himself with fear and anger; at the very moment  when he thought he had arrived at the happy accomplishment of his  wishes, must this wretch come, and frustrate them all! It was the only  way to carry his plan into execution--he must slay the little monster:  with one bound, he sprang from the bed upon him; but the other, who  might perhaps have anticipated something of the kind, let the lamp  fall, which was immediately extinguished, and rushed forth in the  dark, crying vehemently for help.    Now was the time for decisive action; the maids he was obliged, for  the moment, to abandon, and attend only to his own safety:  accordingly, he approached the window, to see if he could not spring  from it. It was a tolerable distance from the ground, and on the other  side stood a lofty wall, which he would have to surmount. Reflecting,  he stood by the window until he heard many voices approaching his  chamber: already were they at the door, when seizing desperately his  dagger, and garments, he let himself down from the window. The fall  was hard, but he felt that no bone was broken; immediately he sprang  up, and ran to the wall which surrounded the court. This, to the  astonishment of his pursuers, he mounted, and soon found himself at  liberty. He ran on until he came to a little forest, where he sank  down exhausted. Here he reflected on what was to be done; his horses  and attendants he was obliged to leave behind, but the money, which he  had placed in his girdle, he had saved.    His inventive genius, however, soon pointed him to another means of  deliverance. He walked through the wood until he arrived at a village,  where for a small sum he purchased a horse, with the help of which, in  a short time, he reached a city. There he inquired for a physician,  and was directed to an old experienced man. On this one he prevailed,  by a few gold pieces, to furnish him with a medicine to produce a  death-like sleep, which, by means of another, might be instantaneously  removed. Having obtained this, he purchased a long false beard, a  black gown, and various boxes and retorts, so that he could readily  pass for a travelling physician; these articles he placed upon an ass,  and rode back to the castle of Thiuli-Kos. He was certain, this time,  of not being recognised, for the beard disfigured him so that he  scarcely knew himself.    Arrived in the vicinity of the castle, he announced himself as the  physician Chakamankabudibaba, and matters turned out as he had  expected. The splendor of the name procured him extraordinary favor  with the old fool, who invited him to table. Chakamankabudibaba  appeared before Thiuli, and, having conversed with him scarcely an  hour, the old man resolved that all his female slaves should submit to  the examination of the wise physician. The latter could scarcely  conceal his joy at the idea of once more beholding his beloved sister,  and with palpitating heart followed Thiuli, who conducted him to his  seraglio. They reached an unoccupied room, which was beautifully  furnished.    \"Chambaba, or whatever thou mayest be called, my good physician,\" said  Thiuli-Kos, \"look once at that hole in the wall; thence shall each of  my slaves stretch forth her arm, and thou canst feel whether the pulse  betoken sickness or health.\"    Answer as he might, Mustapha could not arrange it so that he might see  them; nevertheless, Thiuli agreed to tell him, each time, the usual  health of the one he was examining. Thiuli drew forth a long list from  his girdle, and began, with loud voice, to call out, one by one, the  names of his slaves; whereupon, each time, a hand came forth from the  wall, and the physician felt the pulse. Six had been read off, and  declared entirely well, when Thiuli, for the seventh called Fatima,  and a small white hand slipped forth from the wall. Trembling with  joy, Mustapha grasped it, and with an important air pronounced her  seriously ill. Thiuli became very anxious, and commanded his wise  Chakamankabudibaba straightway to prescribe some medicine for her. The  physician left the room, and wrote a little scroll:    \"Fatima, I will preserve thee, if thou canst make up thy mind to take  a draught, which for two days will make thee dead; nevertheless, I  possess the means of restoring thee to life. If thou wilt, then only  return answer, that this liquid has been of no assistance, and it will  be to me a token that thou agreest.\"    In a moment he returned to the room, where Thiuli had remained. He  brought with him an innocent drink, felt the pulse of the sick Fatima  once more, pushed the note beneath her bracelet, and then handed her  the liquid through the opening in the wall. Thiuli seemed to be in  great anxiety on Fatima's account, and postponed the examination of  the rest to a more fitting opportunity. As he left the room with  Mustapha, he addressed him in sorrowful accents:    \"Chadibaba, tell me plainly, what thinkest thou of Fatima's illness?\"    My brother answered with a deep sigh: \"Ah, sir, may the Prophet give  you consolation! she has a slow fever, which may, perhaps, cost her  life!\"    Then burned Thiuli's anger: \"What sayest thou, cursed dog of a  physician? She, for whom I gave two thousand gold pieces--shall she  die like a cow? Know, if thou preservest her not, I will chop off  thine head!\"    My brother immediately saw that he had made a misstep, and again  inspired Thiuli with hope. While they were yet conversing, a black  slave came from the seraglio to tell the physician, that the drink had  been of no assistance.    \"Put forth all thy skill, Chakamdababelda, or whatever thy name may  be; I will pay thee what thou askest!\" cried out Thiuli-Kos, well-nigh  howling with sorrow, at the idea of losing so much gold.    \"I will give her a potion, which will put her out of all danger,\"  answered the physician.    \"Yes, yes!--give it her,\" sobbed the old Thiuli.    With joyful heart Mustapha went to bring his soporific, and having  given it to the black slave, and shown him how much it was necessary  to take for a dose, he went to Thiuli, and, telling him he must  procure some medicinal herbs from the sea, hastened through the gate.  On the shore, which was not far from the castle, he removed his false  garments, and cast them into the water, where they floated merrily  around; concealing himself, however, in a thicket, he awaited the  night, and then stole softly to the burying-place of Thiuli's castle.    Hardly an hour had Mustapha been absent, when they brought Thiuli the  intelligence that his slave Fatima was in the agonies of death. He  sent them to the sea-coast to bring the physician back with all speed,  but his messengers returned alone, with the news that the poor  physician had fallen into the water, and was drowned; that they had  espied his black gown floating upon the surface, and that now and then  his large beard peeped forth from amid the billows. Thiuli seeing now  no help, cursed himself and the whole world; plucked his beard, and  dashed his head against the wall. But all this was of no use, for soon  Fatima gave up the ghost, in the arms of her companions. When the  unfortunate man heard the news of her death, he commanded them quickly  to make a coffin, for he could not tolerate a dead person in his  house; and bade them bear forth the corpse to the place of burial. The  carriers brought in the coffin, but quickly set it down and fled, for  they heard sighs and sobs among the other piles.    Mustapha, who, concealed behind the coffins, had inspired the  attendants with such terror, came forth and lighted a lamp, which he  had brought for that purpose. Then he drew out a vial which contained  the life-restoring medicine, and lifted the lid of Fatima's coffin.  But what amazement seized him, when by the light of the lamp, strange  features met his gaze! Neither my sister, nor Zoraida, but an entire  stranger, lay in the coffin! It was some time before he could recover  from this new stroke of destiny; at last, however, compassion  triumphed over anger. He opened the vial, and administered the liquid.  She breathed--she opened her eyes--and seemed for some time to be  reflecting where she was. At length, recalling all that had happened,  she rose from the coffin, and threw herself, sobbing, at Mustapha's  feet.    \"How may I thank thee, excellent being,\" she exclaimed, \"for having  freed me from my frightful prison?\" Mustapha interrupted her  expressions of gratitude by inquiring, how it happened that she, and  not his sister Fatima, had been preserved. The maiden looked in  amazement.    \"Now is my deliverance explained, which was before incomprehensible,\"  answered she. \"Know that in this castle I am called Fatima, and it was  to me thou gavest thy note, and the preserving-drink.\"    My brother entreated her to give him intelligence of his sister and  Zoraida, and learned that they were both in the castle, but, according  to Thiuli's custom, had received different names; they were now  called Mirza and Nurmahal. When Fatima, the rescued slave, saw that my  brother was so cast down by this failure of his enterprise, she bade  him take courage, and promised to show him means whereby he could  still deliver both the maidens. Aroused by this thought, Mustapha was  filled with new hope, and besought her to point out to him the way.    \"Only five months,\" said she, \"have I been Thiuli's slave;  nevertheless, from the"]]]
