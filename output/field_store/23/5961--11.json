Looking back I found it easy to answer this question myself, for,  perhaps, beginning with a little gentle aversion to the English rimed  translations of the \"Divine Comedy,\" my love for Dante has been a slow  growth. The Dante specialists discourage us with their learning. There  are few who, like Mr. Plimpton, can lucidly expose the foundations of  the educations of Dante to us without frightening us by the sight of a  wall of impregnable erudition. Naturally, one cannot approach Dante in  order to begin an education in the Middle Ages and the Renascence which  one never began in one's own time; but to be consoled by Dante it is not  necessary to be erudite. In fact, to the mind bent on spiritual  enlightenment, the notes of the erudite, above all, the conjectures of  the erudite, are frequently wrong. Even Israel Gollancz, in his three  valuable volumes in the Temple Edition, nods over his notes  occasionally. And by the way, for all amateurs in the reading of the  \"Divine Comedy\" nothing can be better than this Temple Edition, which  contains the Italian on one page and a lucid prose translation into  English on the next. As I grew older I grew more and more enamoured of  Longfellow's Dantean Sonnets, but not of his translation, for all rime  translations must be one half, at least, the author and the other half  the translator. Gollancz is best for anybody who does not enjoy poetic  _tours de force_.    In his note on the most popular lines in the \"Divine Comedy,\"                        _Nessun maggior dolors,      che ricordarsi del tempo felice      nella miseria;_    Gollancz says:         Although these words are translated literally from Bo[:e]thius, and       although we know that Dante had made a special study of Bo[:e]thius,       yet we cannot well identify the _dottore_ with this philosopher:       for how can we be expected to assume that Francesca was acquainted       with these two facts? The reference is probably to Virgil, and to       his position in Limbo.    Into this Limbo Christ descended fifty-two years after Virgil's death  and drew certain souls up with him to Heaven. We are, however, by no  means certain that Virgil was happier on earth than he was \"upon the  green enamel\" (_verde smalto_) in this place of quiet leisure which was  the vestibule to Hell, but not Hell itself, and which, to some chosen  souls, had already been a vestibule to the Palace of the Beatific  Vision. If Dante had been translated in the old days of rigid Calvinism  in Scotland and New England, his tolerance of the pagans who found parts  of Hell not entirely uncomfortable would have caused him to be looked on  as a corruptor of the faith. But what would they have said to the  \"Paradiso\" which I have always found more full of consolation than any  sermon that was ever preached? Let us take the description of the Church  Triumphant in Canto XXXII. How sweetly Dante disposes of the heresy that  all children unbaptized by material water are doomed:        _Dunque, senza merce di lor costume,        locati son per gradi differenti,        sol differendo nel primiero acume._        _Bastava si nei secoli recenti        con l'innocenza, per aver salute,        solamente la fede dei parenti;_        _poiche le prime etadi fur compiute,        convenne ai maschi all' innocenti penne,        per circoncidere, acquistar virtute._        _Ma poichee il tempo della grazia venne,        senza battesmo perfetto di Cristo,        tale innocenza laggiu si ritenne._    And then remembering the innocence of the little children Dante turns to  that face \"which is most likest unto Christ's\" the face of Mary the  Mother, who is the protectress and friend of all children. If the strict  Calvinists had known the \"Paradiso\" of Dante as well as they knew their  Old Testament, their theology might have found more adherence among the  merciful, for the \"Paradiso\" is a triumphant song of mercy, of love, and  of the final triumph of every soul that has sincerely hoped in, or  sought, the truth, even if the truth were not crowned in its fullness in  this world.    And Dante, put by Raphael without protest from the Church Militant,  among the Doctors of the Faith, glorifies Trajan among the Saved and  opens Heaven to Cato. This shows, by the way, the falsity of the  Voltairean _mauvais mot_, that all the people worth meeting are in Hell!  And Dante sees Constantine in Heaven, although he thinks that this  Emperor's donation of territory was an evil gift. Dante, who, by the  way, was nearer to the old records and this tradition of the older time,  is a witness against Lord Bryce's assertion that the documents of  Constantine's donation were mediaeval forgeries. Dante believed, however,  that the donation was invalid, because the successor of St. Peter, being  of the spirit, could not accept temporal power. This he asserts in his  \"De Monarchia,\" which was for a time on the \"Index.\" Times have changed,  and \"De Monarchia\" and Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" are no longer in the  \"Index,\" though Balzac and Dumas, in French, are. But many of the  Faithful in the United States console themselves by assuming that, as in  the case of Dr. Zahm's \"Religion and Science,\" this the method of the  Sacred Congregation is not without its distinctions. Dr. Zahm's book,  suppressed in Italian, received the proper \"imprimatur\" in English! So  may \"The Three Musketeers\" and may \"Monte Cristo\" be regarded as coming  under the ban in the original, but as tolerated in the translation?    Dante's bitterness against certain Popes made no rift in his creed, nor  does it seem to have made him less respected by the Roman Court. There  is in the \"Paradiso\" that great passage on the poet's faith--        _Cos[`i] spir[`o] di quell' amore acceso;        indi soggiunse: \"Assai bene [`e] trascorsa        d'esta moneta gi[`a] la lega e il peso;      ma dimmi se tu l' hai nella tua borsa.\"        ed' io: \"Si, l'ho, si lucida e si tonda,        che nel suo conio nulla mi s' inforsa.\"_        _Appresso usci della luce profonda,        che li splendeva; \"Questa cara gioia,        sopra la quale ogni virt[`u] si fonda,      onde ti venne?\" Ed io: \"La larga ploia        dello Spirito Santo, ch' [`e] diffusa        in su le vecchie e in su le nuove cuoia,_        _[`E] sillogismo, che la mia ha conchiusa        acutamente si, che in verso d' ella        ogni dimostrazion mi pare ottusa.\"_    If the reading of the \"Paradiso\" turns one to other books, so much the  better. Aristotle is worth while; he holds the germ of what is best in  modern life; and St. Thomas Aquinas, his echo, with new harmonies added  the Wagner to Aristotle's Mozart. No--that is going too far!--the  musical comparison fails. \"If thou should'st never see my face again,  pray for my soul,\" is King Arthur's prayer. It is the prayer of Pope  Gregory that saved Trajan.    When we come to the \"Purgatorio,\" like the \"Paradiso\" too neglected, we  find much that illuminates our minds and touches our hearts. The  \"Purgatorio\" is not without humour, and it is certainly very human. For  instance, there is the case of the negligent ruler, Nino de' Visconti.  Dante is frankly pleased to meet him, but his address is hardly tactful.  He is evidently surprised to find that Nino is not in Hell,        When he came near to me I said to him;        gentle Judge Nino, how I'm delighted well        that I have seen thee here and not in Hell.    Nino begs that his innocent daughter, Giovanna, may be asked by Dante,  on his return to earth, to pray for him. He is not pleased that his  widow should desire to marry         the Milanese who blazoned a viper on his shield.    He thinks that his wife has ceased to love him as she has discarded her  \"white wimples,\" which, if she marries this inferior person, she may  long for once again! And he adds, rather cynically, for a blessed soul  in Purgatory, that through her one may mightily well         know how short a time love may last in woman, if the eye and the       touch do not keep it alive.    One must admit that there is an element of humour--not for the  victim--in the \"Inferno,\" when Dante puts Pope Boniface VIII. into Hell  three and a half years before he died! Nicholas III., whom Dante thought  guilty of the unpardonable sin of simony, had preceded Boniface; and he  says,        _E se non fosse ch' ancor lo mi vieta        la riverenza delle somme chiavi,        che tu tenesti nella vita lieta        l' userei parole ancor pi[`u] gravi--_    But for consolation, there is no great poem so good as the \"Paradiso.\"      _English and American Verse_    Edmund Clarence Stedman tells us how thrilled the youths of his  generation were when the new poet, Tennyson, \"swam into their ken.\" It  is difficult for the young of to-day to believe this. There is no great  reigning poet to-day; there are great numbers of fair poets, who are  hailed as crown princes by the groups that gather about them. Whatever  the old may say, this is a good sign. Any evidence of a sincere interest  in poetry is a good sign. Tennyson's \"Dream of Fair Women\" and his  portrait studies broke in on the old tradition. \"The Lady of Shalott,\"  with its pictures of silence and its fine transmutation of commonplace  into something very beautiful, was new.    We who succeeded Stedman by some years loved all the beauty of Tennyson  while we were not especially struck by those mediaeval lay figures which  he labelled \"King Arthur\" and \"Sir Galahad\" and \"Sir Percival.\" They  were too much like what the English people at that time insisted that  the Prince Consort was. Even Sir Lancelot would have profited in our  eyes by a touch of the fire of Milton's \"Lucifer.\" But the lyricism of  Tennyson, the music of Tennyson, is as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#13)"],[1,"rit, only one!'    It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of  something, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their  questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to  which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an  animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an  animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and  lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show  of, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was  never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a  bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every  fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar  of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to  get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a  similar state, cried out:    'I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!'    'What is it?' cried Fred.    'It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.'    Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though  some objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been  'Yes'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have  diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had  any tendency that way.    'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,' said Fred, 'and it  would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled  wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, \"Uncle Scrooge!\"'    'Well! Uncle Scrooge!' they cried.    'A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!'  said Scrooge's nephew. 'He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it,  nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!'    Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that  he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked  them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the  whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his  nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.    Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but  always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they  were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by  struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,  and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery's every  refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast  the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing and taught  Scrooge his precepts.    It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts  of this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into  the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that, while  Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,  clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it  until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking at the  Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair  was grey.    'Are spirits' lives so short?' asked Scrooge.    'My life upon this globe is very brief,' replied the Ghost. 'It ends  to-night.'    'To-night!' cried Scrooge.    'To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.'    The chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven at that moment.    'Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,' said Scrooge, looking  intently at the Spirit's robe, 'but I see something strange, and not  belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a  claw?'    'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's  sorrowful reply. 'Look here!'    From the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,  frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung  upon the outside of its garment.    'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.    They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but  prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have  filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a  stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted  them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat  enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no  degradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the  mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and  dread.    Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he  tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,  rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.    'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.    'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they  cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This  girl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of  all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,  unless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out  his hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for  your factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'    'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.    'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last  time with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'    The bell struck Twelve.    Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last  stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob  Marley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and  hooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.      STAVE FOUR          THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS      The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,  Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this  Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.    It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its  face, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched  hand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure  from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was  surrounded.    He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that  its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,  for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.    'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said  Scrooge.    The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.    'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,  but will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,  Spirit?'    The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its  folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer  he received.    Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the  silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found  that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit  paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to  recover.    But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,  uncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were  ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his  own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great  heap of black.    'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre  I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope  to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your  company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'    It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.    'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is  precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'    The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in  the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him  along.    They scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to  spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they  were in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried  up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in  groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their  great gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.    The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing  that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their  talk.    'No,' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, 'I don't know much  about it either way. I only know he's dead.'    'When did he die?' inquired another.    'Last night, I believe.'    'Why, what was the matter with him?' asked a third, taking a vast  quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. 'I thought he'd never  die.'    'God knows,' said the first, with a yawn.    'What has he done with his money?' asked a red-faced gentleman with a  pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills  of a turkey-cock.    'I haven't heard,' said the man with the large chin, yawning again.  'Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to _me_. That's all  I know.'    This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.    'It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,' said the same speaker; 'for,  upon my life, I don't know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a  party, and volunteer?'    'I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,' observed the gentleman with  the excrescence on his nose. 'But I must be fed if I make one.'    Another laugh.    [Illust"]]]
