Knight asked him if they were going to live together like  brothers in the same wig-wam, and the Indian answered they were, and  they went in very friendly talk. At night-fall when they camped, Knight  let his guard bind him, but he spent the hours till daybreak trying  secretly to free himself. At dawn the Indian rose and unbound his  captive. Then he rekindled the fire, at the same time fighting the gnats  that swarmed upon his naked body. He willingly consented that Knight  should make a smoke to drive them from his back, and Knight took a heavy  stick from the fire as if to do this; but when he got behind the Indian  he struck him on the head with all his strength. The Indian fell forward  into the fire, but quickly gathered himself up and ran off howling.  Knight wanted to shoot him as he ran; in his eagerness to cock the rifle  he broke the lock, and the Indian escaped. He got safely to the Shawnee  town, where he described the fight in terms that transformed the little  doctor into a furious giant, whom no amount of stabbing had any effect  upon.    [Illustration: Knight escapes 097L]    The other Indians, who seem to have understood this cowardly boaster,  received his story with shouts of laughter. But Knight was very glad  to make off with his gun and ammunition, and leave them to settle the  affair among themselves. When he came to the prairies he hid himself in  the grass and waited till dark before venturing to cross them, and  by daybreak he was in the woods again. He could kill nothing with his  broken gun, and he lived for twenty-one days on wild gooseberries, with  two young blackbirds and a tortoise, which he ate raw. He reached the  Ohio River on the twenty-second day, and crossed in safety to Fort  Mcintosh.    The tragic adventures of the Indian captives must often have been  relieved by comic incidents like those of Knight's escape from his  guard; but there is very little record of anything except sorrow and  suffering, danger and death. Certainly in the captivity of John Slover,  another of Crawford's ill-starred and ill-willed crew of marauders,  there were few gleams of happier chance to distinguish it from most  histories of the sort. He had been captured by the Indians when a boy  of eight years, and carried from his home in Virginia to their town of  Sandusky, where he was adopted into their nation, and where he lived  quite happily till his twentieth year, when he was given up to his own  people.    He fought through two years of the Revolutionary War, and he was  thoroughly fitted to act as a guide for Crawford.    After the battle, or rather the disorderly rout, he was one of those who  was mired in the swamps. He left his horse there, and with a few others  tried to make his way to Detroit. Twice the party escaped capture by  hiding in the grass, as the Indians passed near them, but on the third  morning they were ambushed; two were killed, one ran away, and the  remaining three gave themselves up on the promise of good treatment.  They were taken to Wapatimika, where Simon Kenton was to have been  burned, and they soon proved how far the promises of the savages were to  be trusted.    The Indians knew Slover at once, and they bitterly reproached him with  having come to betray his friends. At the council held to try him,  James Girty urged them to put him to death for his treason. But Slover  strongly defended himself, reminding the Indians that they had freely  given him up, and had no longer any claim upon him. His words had such  weight that the council put off its decision. In the meantime he was  left with an old squaw, who hid him under a bear skin, and scolded off  the messengers who came to bring him before a grand council of Shawnee,  Delaware, Wyandot, Chippewa, and Mingo warriors. But shortly after,  Girty came with forty braves and seized him. Slover was now stripped,  and with his hands tied and his face painted black, he was taken to a  village five miles off, where he was beaten as usual by the people,  and then driven a little farther to another village, where he found  everything made ready to burn him, as Crawford had been burned. He was  tied to the stake, and the fire was lighted; an orator began to kindle  the anger of the savages; but at the last moment a heavy shower of rain  burst over the roofless council house where they had gathered to torture  their captive, put out the fire, and drove them to a sheltered part of  the lodge, where they consoled themselves as best they could by beating  him till midnight, and promising him that he should be burned the next  day. He was then carried to the blockhouse and left bound with two  guards, who entertained themselves, but did not amuse Slover, by talking  over his probable behavior under the torture that awaited him. They fell  asleep, worn out, about daybreak, when Slover made a desperate effort to  free himself, and to his own astonishment, succeeded. He stepped across  his snoring guards out into the open air. No one was astir in the  village, and he ran to hide himself in a cornfield, where he nearly fell  over a sleeping squaw and her papooses. On the other side of the field  he found some horses, and making a halter of the buffalo thong that had  bound him, and that still hung upon his arm, he leaped upon one of them  and dashed through the woods. By ten o'clock in the forenoon he had  reached the Scioto fifty miles away.    He allowed his horse to breathe here; then he remounted, crossed the  river, and galloped half as far again. At three o'clock his horse gave  out, and Slover left him and ran forward afoot, spurred on by the yells  of the pursuers close behind him. The moon came up, and knowing that his  trail could be easily followed by her light, he ran till daybreak. The  next night he reached the Muskingum, naked, torn by briers, and covered  with the mosquitoes which swarmed upon his bleeding body. A few wild  raspberries enabled him to break his fast for the first time, but the  next day he feasted upon two crawfish. When he came to the Ohio, just  across from Wheeling, and called to a man whom he saw on the island  there, to bring his canoe and take him over, it is not strange that the  man should have hesitated at the sight of the figure on the Ohio shore.  Not till Slover had given him the names of many men in Crawford's army,  as well as his own name, did the man come to his rescue and ferry him  over to the fort, where he was safe at last.          XI. THE INDIAN WARS AND ST. CLAIR'S DEFEAT.    The Indians and the renegades at Sandusky would not believe their  prisoners when Crawford's men told them that Cornwallis and his army had  surrendered to Washington; but the Revolutionary War had now really come  to an end. The next year Great Britain acknowledged the independence  of the United States, and gave up the whole West to them, as France  had given it up to her before. Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,  Pennsylvania, and Virginia claimed each the country lying westward  of them, but the other states denied this claim. The West was finally  declared the property of the whole Union, and in 1784 the first  ordinance was passed by Congress for its government. It was not until  1787 that the great ordinance was passed which gave the future empire  of the world to the West on terms of freedom to all men: \"There shall  be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said Territory  otherwise than in the punishment of crime.\"    This made the West free forever, but no law of Congress could make it  safe without the consent of the savage nations which had again changed  masters by the treaty of foreign powers. The war between England and  America was over, but the war between white men and red men raged  more fiercely after our peace with Great Britain than before. The  backwoodsmen took this peace for a sign that they might now cross the  river from New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to settle in the Ohio  country; and they were soon there by hundreds. It is true that the  United States had made treaties with the United Tribes for certain  tracts beyond the Ohio River, but the Indians declared that they had  been tricked into these treaties. It is true that Congress meant to deal  fairly by them so far as to drive the hard bargains with them for their  lands which the white men had always driven with the Indians; but the  backwoodsmen waited for nothing, and the old story of surprises and  slaughters, of captivities and tortures, went on, with the difference  that the war parties now need not cross the Ohio to take scalps and  prisoners, and the vengeance of the pioneers had not so far to follow  them in their return to the woods.    The first white settlers in Ohio were largely the kind of half-savages  who had butchered the Christians at Gnadenhiitten. They built their  cabins and cleared their fields on lands so shamelessly stolen that in  1785 a force of United States troops was sent to drive them out of their  holdings. They seemed to go, but in reality they staid, and wherever the  backwoodsman planted his foot west of the Ohio, he never turned his face  eastward again.    He was unlawfully there, but from the Indian's point of view he was no  more unrightfully there than the settlers who came a few years later to  take up farms under the land companies authorized by Congress. If any  other proof were wanting that these companies possessed themselves of  land which the Indians believed they had never sold, it would appear in  the fact that the first thing the settlers did was to build a stockade,  or high bullet-proof fence of logs with a strong blockhouse for a kind  of citadel, where they might gather for safety in case of attacks from  any of the wild natives of the woods about them.    The invaders were from New England, from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],[0,"Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#13)"],[1,"the  wilderness.  At first only one or two were seen, but afterwards as many  as fifty or sixty were passed in a day.  At one place a hundred were  found together, and near the wells of El Hammar they were lying too  thickly to be counted.  One morning as Denham, dozing on his horse, was  riding, he was startled by a peculiar sound of something crashing under  the animal's feet, and, on looking down, he found that he was trampling  over two human skeletons, one of the horse's feet having driven a skull  before him like a ball.  To some of the bones portions of the flesh and  hair still adhered, and the features of others were distinguishable.  Two skeletons of females lay close together, who had evidently died in  each other's arms.    The Arabs, accustomed to such scenes, laughed at the sympathy exhibited  by the English, observing, with a curse on their fathers, that they were  only blacks.  There can be no doubt that the larger group consisted of a  number of slaves captured by the Sultan of Fezzan, during a late  expedition he had made into Soudan.  His troops, having left Bornou with  an insufficient supply of provisions, allowed their unhappy captives to  perish, while they made their escape with the food intended to support  them.    One evening the major exhibited a book of drawings made by Captain Lyon,  to Boo-Khaloum.  The portraits he understood, but he could not  comprehend the landscapes, and would look at one upside down.  On seeing  a beautiful print of sand-wind in the desert, though it was twice  reversed, he exclaimed: \"Why, it is all the same!\"  Probably a European,  even, who had never before cast his eye on the representation of a  landscape, would be long before he could appreciate the beauties of the  picture.  One beautiful moonlight evening Denham exhibited his  telescope.  An old _hadji_, after he had been helped to fix the glass on  the moon, uttering an exclamation of wonder, walked off as fast as he  could, repeating words from the Koran.    Few adventures were met with; but one whole day the travellers were  annoyed by a strong east wind, and the next day the wind and drifting  sand were so violent that they were compelled to keep their tents.  They  had to sit in their shirts, as the sand could thus be shaken off as soon  as it made a lodgment, which with any other articles of dress could not  be done.  Denham found the greatest relief by rubbing the neck and  shoulders with oil, and being shampooed by his servant, Barca's wife,  who, when a slave in the palace of the pacha, had learned the art.    The Tibboos, a tribe who had for some time accompanied them, went off to  obtain some sheep, an ox, honey, milk and fat.  On their return the milk  turned out sour camels' milk, full of sand, and the fat very rancid,  while a single lean sheep was purchased for two dollars.    Some of their horses were very handsome and extremely fat, which arose  from being fed entirely on camels' milk, corn being too scarce for the  Tibboos to spare them.    The girls of this tribe were pretty, but the men extremely ugly.    Their Arabs, who were sent as an escort to oppose banditti, after a time  became dissatisfied at having nothing to do, and were evidently  contemplating inroads on the inhabitants.    Denham, with Boo-Khaloum and a dozen horsemen, each having a footman  behind him, started off towards a spot where some Tibboo tents had been  seen.  On their arrival they found that the shepherds had moved off,  knowing well how they should be treated by the white people, as they  called the Arabs.  Their caution was made the excuse for plundering  them.  \"What! not stay to sell their sheep? the rogues!\" exclaimed the  Arabs.    After a time they came in sight of two hundred head of cattle and about  twenty persons--men, women and children--with camels, moving off.  The  Arabs, slipping from behind their leaders, with a shout, rushed down the  hill, part running towards the cattle to prevent their escape.  The  unfortunate people were rapidly plundered, the camels were brought to  the ground and the whole of their loads rifled.  The poor women and  girls lifted up their hands, stripped as they were to the skin, but  Denham felt that he could do nothing for them beyond saving their lives.    When Boo-Khaloum came up, however, he seemed ashamed of the paltry booty  his followers had obtained, and Denham seized the favourable moment to  advise that the Arabs should give everything back, and have a few sheep  and an ox for a feast.  He gave the order, and the property was  restored, with the exception of ten sheep and a fat bullock.    An old _maraboot_ assured Denham that to plunder those who left their  tents, instead of supplying travellers, was quite lawful.  Too often the  natives are not only plundered, but murdered, by the armed attendants of  caravans as they make their way across the desert.    The natives, as may be supposed, retaliate.  Should any animal straggle  from the main body, it is certain to be carried off.  Major Denham lost  a favourite dog, which was captured and eaten.    On reaching Lara, a small town of conical-topped rush huts, to the  delight of the travellers they saw before them, from a rising ground,  the boundless expanse of Lake Chad, glowing with the golden rays of the  sun.  They hastened down to the shores of this large inland sea, which  was darkened with numberless birds of varied plumage--ducks, geese,  pelicans and cranes four or five feet high, immense spoonbills of snowy  whiteness, yellow-legged plovers--all quietly feeding at half  pistol-shot.  A large basket to supply their larder was soon filled.    Moving along the shores of the lake, the caravan arrived at Woodie, a  negro town of considerable size.  It was here arranged that the caravan  should wait till an embassy could be sent to the Sheikh of Bornou, to  obtain permission for presenting themselves before him.    The empire of Bornou had, some twenty years before, been overrun and  subjected by the Felatahs, a powerful people to the west.  The present  sheikh, a native of Kanem, though of humble birth, had by his superior  talents and energy rallied round him a band of warriors, and, pretending  that he had received a command from the prophet, hoisted the green flag,  and had in a few months driven the invaders out of the country, which  they had never since been able to occupy, though frequently attacking  his borders.    While waiting for the sheikh's reply, Major Denham rode out early one  morning in search of a herd of a hundred and fifty elephants, which had  been seen the day before.  He found them about six miles from the town,  on ground annually overflowed by the waters of the lake.  They seemed to  cover the whole face of the country, and exceeded the number he expected  to see.  Often, when forced by hunger, they approach the towns and  spread devastation throughout their march, whole plantations being  destroyed in a single night.  Some antelopes were also seen, but they  never allowed the party to get near enough to hazard a shot.    The country for the last eighteen days of their journey had been covered  with a grass which produces a calyx full of prickles.  These adhere to  the dress and penetrate to the skin, to which they fasten themselves  like grappling-irons.  They got between the toes of the poor dog Niger,  and into every part of his long silken hair, so as to make him unable to  walk.    At the next camping-place hyaenas came close to their tents and killed a  camel, on the carcase of which a lion, when he had driven them away,  banqueted, when they returned and devoured what he had left.    Several days' journey took the caravan into the neighbourhood of Kouka.  They had been told that the sheikh's soldiers were a few ragged negroes,  armed with spears, who lived upon the plunder of the black Kaffir  countries.  Greatly to their astonishment, as they approached the town  they beheld a body of several thousand cavalry, drawn up in line and  extending right and left as far as they could see.    As the Arabs approached, a yell was given by the sheikhs people, which  rent the air; and a blast being blown from their rude instruments, they  moved on to meet Boo-Khaloum and his Arabs.  Small bodies kept charging  rapidly towards them, to within a few feet of their horses' heads,  without checking the speed of their own until the moment of their  halting; then they wheeled at their utmost speed with great precision,  shaking their spears over their heads, exclaiming, \"_Baka_ _baka_!\"  (\"Blessing! blessing!\") They quickly, however, surrounded the caravan so  as to prevent it moving on, which greatly enraged Boo-Khaloum, but to no  purpose, as he was only answered by shrieks of welcome, and spears  unpleasantly rattled over the traveller's heads.  In a short time, Barca  Gana, the sheikh's first general--a negro of noble aspect, clothed in a  figured silk _tobe_, mounted on a beautiful Mandara horse--made his  appearance, and cleared away those who had pressed upon them, when the  party moved on slowly towards the city.    Arrived at the gates, Boo-Khaloum, with the English and about a dozen of  his followers, alone were allowed to enter.  They proceeded along a wide  street completely lined with spearmen on foot, with cavalry in front of  them, to the door of the sheikh's residence.  Here the horsemen were  formed up three deep, and the party halted while some of the chief's  attendants came out and, after a great many \"_Baka's! baka's_!\" retired,  when others performed the same ceremony.  On this, Boo-Khaloum again  lost patience, and swore by the pacha's head that he would return to his  tents, if he was not immediately admitted.  Denham advised him to  submit, and Barca Gana, appearing, invited him to dismount.  The English  were about to do the same, when an officer intimated that the Arab alone  was to be admitted.    Another half-hour, and the gates were again opened, and"]]]
