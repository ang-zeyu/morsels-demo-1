A row of skins are joined head to tail and the next row headed  the opposite way will fit in perfectly, the legs being left on the  skins. The sketch with this will explain better than any description.  The guanaco pelt being of a woolly nature makes it unnecessary to run it  all the same way and the entire skins are utilized in spite of their  ungainly shape, the flaps and tabs trimmed off filling the indentations  around the outer edge of the robe. They make an excellent camp blanket  as light and warm as the malodorous, hairy rabbit skin robe of Hudsons  Bay, and no Patagonian ranch house bed is complete without its guanaco  coverlet.    You will likely be called on to repair robes much oftener than to make  them and such work is nearly all profit, as it generally consists in  sewing up rips and tears in the skins. Never attempt to do this from the  front or fur side as it can only be done right from the back. To do this  at least one side of the lining will have to be ripped and the robe  turned, turning it back and resewing it on completion. Linings are  turned under at the edges all around.    [Illustration: PATAGONIAN ROBE OF GUANACO SKINS.]    Worn and soiled linings and trimming often need replacing with new  material and it is sometimes necessary to purchase an unlined goat  \"plate\" to repair robes of that common variety. Worn robes can be cut  down in size if no similar material is to be had for repairs.          CHAPTER XIV.    MOUNTING ENTIRE SMALL FUR ANIMALS.      In Chapters VI and VIII directions are given for skinning and preparing  this class of animals for mounting, so with the skin properly cleaned  and poisoned before us the next thing is to cut the wires for a  supporting frame. These are six in number usually, body wire, tail wire  and one for each leg. The body wire is about one-half longer than from  nose to base of tail; tail wire the length of the tail bone and half the  body, and each leg wire twice the length of the leg.    I have spoken of using a muskrat for an initial attempt as it is of a  convenient size to handle and the length of its fur will hide small  defects in the anatomy. Most books of instruction select a squirrel for  the beginner's victim. It is true it is not as difficult as a hairless  Mexican terrier but it is apt to discourage the learner. An opossum will  do very well or any long haired animal of about that size.    We will first reconstruct a hind leg and if it is a fresh specimen being  mounted without a bath in the pickle we can have the opposite leg in the  flesh to guide, as to proper proportions. The wire is passed through the  cut in the bottom of the foot and along the back of the leg bones where  it is secured in about three places by tying with small cord. The end is  left projecting three inches beyond the end of the upper leg bone.    [Illustration: HIND AND FRONT LEG OF MUSKRAT WRAPPED READY TO CLAY AND  RETURN TO SKIN.]    The muscles and flesh are replaced by winding on tow with stout thread  until the approximate size is reached, when the surface is given a thin  coating of clay and the leg is drawn back into its skin. The fore legs  are in the same manner built to the joint with the shoulder blade.    After sharpening the tail wire to a point it is wound with fine tow and  thread and coated with clay until it duplicates the bone and flesh  removed. This is slipped into the tail sheath with the unwound end  projecting into the body and the slit along the lower side of tail sewed  up.    After making a ring about the diameter of a .22 shell on one end of the  body wire place it on your sketch where the hip joint was marked,  letting the wire run lengthwise of the body. Another ring similar is  made at the shoulder. These form the points of attachment for the legs.    [Illustration: WIRING FOR SMALL ANIMALS, FRONT LEG WIRES TWISTED TO BACK  WIRE.]    The skull, cleaned of flesh and poisoned, should have the muscles  replaced with tow and the whole coated with clay. Force a piece of cork  into the opening at the back of the skull. Sharpen the end of body wire  and force it through the cork and out one of the nostrils. The skull is  pushed back along the wire until it reaches the proper distance from the  shoulder ring, when all but an inch or so of the projecting wire is cut  off.    Insert the skull through the body opening and work it up the neck into  its place in the head skin, letting the end of wire go through the  nostril of skin also. This will hold the nose in place. Adjust the eyes  and ears also.    Now pass the ends of leg wire through the rings from their opposite  sides. The tail wire is passed through the rear ring and twisted around  the body wire a few times. The ends of leg wires projecting through the  ring cross, so twist them together a turn or two with pliers, next bring  them down and under the body wire, twisting them together, first one  side of it and then the other. This treatment will fasten the legs and  tail also firmly to the body wire.    Thus we have the skin with head, tail and legs filled out and the  supporting wires fastened together. The remainder of filling, usually  chopped tow, is placed with fingers, forceps, and stuffers. First a good  layer next the skin all around, then part this and fill in the center a  little at a time, first at one end, then the other. Put a good cushion  at the hips and shoulders between the wires and the skin and also at the  back. Fill out the neck well but do not stretch it unduly.    Begin sewing up at both ends of the opening cut, drawing a few stitches  up and tying the thread while you fill a little more. Model the animal  into shape from time to time by pressure with your hands and when filled  out and sewed up tie the threads together.    Our animal is now lying on its back with head, tail and limbs extended;  bend them into some natural position and set it on its feet. It may be  well to force a little chopped tow and clay into the bottoms of the feet  and draw the cuts in them together with a few stitches around the leg  wire projecting from them.    A temporary stand of a piece of board supported on cleats at each end is  prepared and a number of holes bored for the leg wires. A little  experimenting will find the proper place for these when the surplus ends  of wire are bent along the bottom of the board and fastened with  staples. Complete the head and face modeling now, filling out the cheeks  and lips and pinning them in place. Work the skin around the eyes and  ears into proper place and fasten with pins.    Fill eye sockets with sufficient clay and set the eyes, drawing the lids  down where they belong.    Any deficiencies at the back of the head can be filled through the ears.  In the case of a muskrat the ears are so insignificant that they only  need a little clay and tow forced into them to hold them in place. More  prominent ears as those of fox, 'coon, or wild cat must be filled with a  pasteboard form, cut the proper size and shape, coated with liquid glue  and inserted from the inside before returning the skull to the skin. The  ears of all animals should be pocketed when skinned, that is turned  inside out to their tips to admit preservatives and later some filling  material which will retain their shape when dry.    Do not skin out and throw away the ear cartilage but leave it adhering  to the skin of the inner side of the ear. Without it this skin is very  frail and brittle and thorough pickling will prevent shrinkage and  distortion of the ear.    Before leaving the head push it slightly towards the body on the wire  and cut same close to end of nose. Pull head back to place, the wire  disappears up the nose about 1/4 inch, then you can shape the nostrils  and fill so they will not shrivel up in drying and look as though their  owner had been a mouth breather.    [Illustration: OPOSSUM MOUNTED IN WALKING POSITION.]    If the general pose and appearance seem correct finish up by placing the  feet and toes correctly. Nothing gives a mounted animal a more trampish,  disreputable appearance than slouchy, run over feet with toes that don't  seem to be on the job. Lastly comb the fur out and fluff it up before  setting away to dry.    Animals up to the coyote in size are usually mounted by similar methods  to the preceding. Sometimes a piece of board is substituted for the body  wire, especially in the larger specimens, the wires to which are too  heavy to clinch readily. The skull is on a separate neck wire and all  wires are fastened to the back board by passing through holes and then  stapling.    Of course it is possible to mount small specimens by the same methods  most large ones are, by drawing the skin over a hard filling, in fact a  statuette, which must be made to fit the skin. This method in the case  of small animals requires so much time that it is impossible in ordinary  commercial work.    Strive to put your mounted animals in easy natural poses unless you are  making a grotesque, in which case go the length.    Clean the eyes and teeth with a brush when dry, and beat the fur to make  it stand out. Fasten securely on whatever form of mounting you have  decided on, countersinking the wires on the under side. Accessories, as  a piece of food in the mouth or paws, are added now if they have been  prepared for.    [Illustration: CAT SITTING AND WATCHING]    A slip with record of the specimen written on it and pasted to the under  side of stand will usually be appreciated. If the mouth is wanted open  it should be braced in that position, the lips, etc., held in place by  clay. When it is dry this can be dug out with awls and modelling tools  and the tongue, gums, and inside the mouth modelled in mache or some  plaster composition. The tongue may be modelled in connection with the  lower part of the mouth or made separately and fastened in place with a  brad and some glue.

It was worth the whole  wearisome journey--danger from Indians, grizzly bears, sleeping under  the stars, and all--to behold this beautiful vision. While I stood  breathless with admiration, a singular sound, and an exclamation of \"A  rattlesnake!\" from F., startled me into common sense again. I gave one  look at the reptile, horribly beautiful, like a chain of living opals,  as it corkscrewed itself into that peculiar spiral which it is  compelled to assume in order to make an attack, and then, fear  overcoming curiosity, although I had never seen one of them before, I  galloped out of its vicinity as fast as my little mule could carry me.    The hill leading into Rich Bar is five miles long, and as steep as you  can imagine. Fancy yourself riding for this distance along the edge of  a frightful precipice, where, should your mule make a misstep, you  would be dashed hundreds of feet into the awful ravine below. Every one  we met tried to discourage us, and said that it would be impossible for  me to ride down it. They would take F. aside, much to my amusement, and  tell him that he was assuming a great responsibility in allowing me to  undertake such a journey. I, however, insisted upon going on. About  halfway down we came to a level spot, a few feet in extent, covered  with sharp slate-stones. Here the girth of my saddle, which we  afterwards found to be fastened only by four _tacks_, gave way, and I  fell over the right side, striking on my left elbow. Strange to say, I  was not in the least hurt, and again my heart wept tearful thanks to  God, for, had the accident happened at any other part of the hill, I  must have been dashed, a piece of shapeless nothingness, into the dim  valleys beneath.    F. soon mended the saddle-girth. I mounted my darling little mule, and  rode triumphantly into Rich Bar at five o'clock in the evening. The  Rich Barians are astonished at my courage in daring to ride down the  hill. Many of the miners have told me that they dismounted several  times while descending it. I, of course, feel very vain of my exploit,  and glorify myself accordingly, being particularly careful, all the  time, not to inform my admirers that my courage was the result of the  know-nothing, fear-nothing principle; for I was certainly ignorant,  until I had passed them, of the dangers of the passage. Another thing  that prevented my dismounting was the apparently utter impossibility,  on such a steep and narrow path, of mounting again. Then, I had much  more confidence in my mule's power of picking the way and keeping his  footing, than in my own. It is the prettiest sight in the world to see  these cunning creatures stepping so daintily and cautiously among the  rocks. Their pretty little feet, which absolutely do not look larger  than a silver dollar, seem made on purpose for the task. They are often  perfect little vixens with their masters, but an old mountaineer, who  has ridden them for twenty years, told me that he never knew one to be  skittish with a woman. The intelligent darlings seem to know what a  bundle of helplessness they are carrying, and scorn to take advantage  of it.    We are boarding, at present, at the \"Empire,\" a huge shingle palace in  the center of Rich Bar, which I will describe in my next letter.  Pardon, dear M., the excessive egotism of this letter; but you have  often flattered me by saying that my epistles were only interesting  when profusely illuminated by that manuscriptal decoration represented  by a great _I_. A most intense love of the ornament myself makes it  easy for me to believe you, and doubt not that my future communications  will be as profusely stained with it as even you could desire.

I believe that I closed my last letter by informing you that I was  safely ensconced--after all the hair-breadth escapes of my wearisome,  though at the same time delightful, journey--under the magnificent roof  of the \"Empire,\" which, by the way, is _the_ hotel of the place, not  but that nearly ever other shanty on the Bar claims the same  grandiloquent title. Indeed, for that matter, California herself might  be called the Hotel State, so completely is she inundated with taverns,  boarding-houses, etc. The Empire is the only two-story building in  town, and absolutely has a live \"upstairs.\" Here you will find two or  three glass windows, an unknown luxury in all the other dwellings. It  is built of planks of the roughest possible description. The roof, of  course, is covered with canvas, which also forms the entire front of  the house, on which is painted, in immense capitals, the following  imposing letters: \"THE EMPIRE!\" I will describe, as exactly as  possible, this grand establishment. You first enter a large apartment,  level with the street, part of which is fitted up as a barroom, with  that eternal crimson calico which flushes the whole social life of the  Golden State with its everlasting red, in the center of a fluted mass  of which gleams a really elegant mirror, set off by a background of  decanters, cigar-vases, and jars of brandied fruit; the whole forming a  _tout ensemble_ of dazzling splendor. A table covered with a green  cloth,--upon which lies a pack of monte-cards, a back-gammon-board, and  a sickening pile of \"yallow-kivered\" literature,--with several  uncomfortable-looking benches, complete the furniture of this most  important portion of such a place as \"The Empire.\" The remainder of the  room does duty as a shop, where velveteen and leather, flannel shirts  and calico ditto,--the latter starched to an appalling state of  stiffness,--lie cheek by jowl with hams, preserved meats, oysters, and  other groceries, in hopeless confusion. From the barroom you ascend by  four steps into the parlor, the floor of which is covered by a straw  carpet. This room contains quite a decent looking-glass, a sofa  fourteen feet long and a foot and a half wide, painfully suggestive of  an aching back,--of course covered with red calico (the sofa, _not_ the  back),--a round table with a green cloth, six cane-bottom chars,  red-calico curtains, a cooking-stove, a rocking-chair, _and_ a woman  and a baby, (of whom more anon,) the latter wearing a scarlet frock, to  match the sofa and curtains. A flight of four steps leads from the  parlor to the upper story, where, on each side of a narrow entry, are  four eight-feet-by-ten bedrooms, the floors of which are covered by  straw matting. Here your eyes are again refreshed with a glittering  vision of red-calico curtains gracefully festooned above wooden windows  picturesquely lattice-like. These tiny chambers are furnished with  little tables covered with oilcloth, and bedsteads so heavy that  nothing short of a giant's strength could move them. Indeed, I am  convinced that they were built, piece by piece, on the spot where they  now stand. The entire building is lined with purple calico, alternating  with a delicate blue, and the effect is really quite pretty. The floors  are so very uneven that you are always ascending a hill or descending  into a valley. The doors consist of a slight frame covered with  dark-blue drilling, and are hung on hinges of leather. As to the  kitchen and dining-room, I leave to your vivid imagination to picture  their primitiveness, merely observing that nothing was ever more  awkward and unworkmanlike than the whole tenement. It is just such a  piece of carpentering as a child two years old, gifted with the  strength of a man, would produce, if it wanted to play at making  grown-up houses. And yet this impertinent apology for a house cost its  original owners more than eight thousand dollars. This will not be  quite so surprising when I inform you that, at the time it was built,  everything had to be packed from Marysville at a cost of forty cents a  pound. Compare this with the price of freight on the railroads at home,  and you will easily make an estimate of the immense outlay of money  necessary to collect the materials for such an undertaking at Rich Bar.  It was built by a company of gamblers as a residence for two of those  unfortunates who make a trade--a thing of barter--of the holiest  passion, when sanctified by _love_, that ever thrills the wayward heart  of poor humanity. To the lasting honor of _miners_ be it written, the  _speculation_ proved a decided failure. Yes! these thousand men, many  of whom had been for years absent from"]]]
