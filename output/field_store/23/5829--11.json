The _pattern-makers  spokeshave_, Fig. 119, which has a wooden frame, is better suited to  more careful work. The method of using the spokeshave is shown in Fig.  120. (See p. 100.)    [Illustration: Fig. 120. Using a Spokeshave.]    The _router-plane_, Figs. 121 and 122, is used to lower a certain part  of a surface and yet keep it parallel with the surrounding part, and  it is particularly useful in cutting panels, dadoes, and grooves. The  cutter has to be adjusted for each successive cut. Where there are a  number of dadoes to be cut of the same depth, it is wise not to finish  them one at a time, but to carry on the cutting of all together,  lowering the cutter after each round. In this way all the dadoes will  be finished at exactly the same depth.    [Illustration: Fig. 121. Router-Plane.]    The _dowel-pointer_, Fig. 123, is a convenient tool for removing the  sharp edges from the ends of dowel pins. It is held in a brace. The  cutter is adjustable and is removable for sharpening.    The _cornering tool_, Fig. 124, is a simple device for rounding sharp  corners. A cutter at each end cuts both ways so that it can be used  with the grain without changing the position of the work. The depth of  the cut is fixed.    [Illustration: Fig. 122. Using a Router-Plane.]      2. BORING TOOLS.    Some boring tools, like awls, force the material apart, and some, like  augers, remove material.    The _brad-awl_, Fig. 125, is wedge-shaped, and hence care needs to  be taken in using it to keep the edge across the grain so as to avoid  splitting the wood, especially thin wood. The size is indicated by the  length of the blade when new,--a stupid method. The awl is useful for  making small holes in soft wood, and it can readily be sharpened by  grinding.    [Illustration: Fig. 123. Dowel-Pointer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 124. Cornering Tool.]    [Illustration: Fig. 125. Brad-Awl.]    [Illustration: Fig. 126. Twist-Drill.]    [Illustration: Fig. 127. Twist-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 128. German Gimlet-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 129. Bit-Point Drill.]    [Illustration: Fig. 130. Auger-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 131. Plug-Cutter.]    [Illustration: Fig. 132. Center-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 133. Foerstner Auger-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 134. Expansive-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 135. Reamer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 136. Rose Countersink.]    _Gimlets_ and _drills_ are alike in that they cut away material, but  unlike in that the cutting edge of the gimlet is on the side, while  the cutting edge of the drill is on the end.    _Twist-drills_, Fig. 126, are very hard and may be used in drilling  metal. They are therefore useful where there is danger of meeting  nails, as in repair work. Their sizes are indicated by a special drill  gage, Fig. 220, p. 117.    _Twist-bits_, Fig. 127, are like twist-drills except that they are not  hard enough to use for metal. Their sizes are indicated on the tang  in 32nds of an inch. Both twist-bits and drill-bits have the advantage  over gimlet-bits in that they are less likely to split the wood.    Twist-bits and twist-drills are sharpened on a grindstone, care being  taken to preserve the original angle of the cutting edge so that the  edge will meet the wood and there will be clearance.    _German gimlet-bits_, Fig. 128, have the advantage of centering well.  The size is indicated on the tang in 32nds of an inch. They are useful  in boring holes for short blunt screws as well as deep holes. They  cannot be sharpened readily but are cheap and easily replaced.    _Bit-point drills_, Fig. 129, are useful for accurate work, but are  expensive.    _Auger-bits_, Fig. 130, have several important features. The spur  centers the bit in its motion, and since it is in the form of a  pointed screw draws the auger into the wood. Two sharp nibs on either  side score the circle, out of which the lips cut the shavings, which  are then carried out of the hole by the main screw of the tool. The  size of auger-bits is indicated by a figure on the tang in 16ths of an  inch. Thus 9 means a diameter of 9/16\".    There are three chief precautions to be taken in using auger-bits. (1)  One is to bore perpendicularly to the surface. A good way to do this  is to lay the work flat, either on the bench or in the vise, and sight  first from the front and then from the side of the work, to see that  the bit is perpendicular both ways. The test may also be made with the  try-square, Fig. 137, or with a plumb-line, either by the worker,  or in difficult pieces, by a fellow worker. The sense of  perpendicularity, however, should constantly be cultivated. (2)  Another precaution is that, in thru boring, the holes should not be  bored quite thru from one side, lest the wood be splintered off on the  back. When the spur pricks thru, the bit should be removed, the piece  turned over, and the boring finished, putting the spur in the hole  which is pricked thru in boring from the first side. It is seldom  necessary to press against the knob of the brace in boring, as the  thread on the spur will pull the bit thru, especially in soft wood.  Indeed, as the bit reaches nearly thru the board, if the knob is  gently pulled back, then when the spur pricks thru the bit will  be pulled out of its hole. This avoids the necessity of constantly  watching the back of the board to see if the spur is thru. (3) In stop  boring, as in boring for dowels or in making a blind mortise, care  should be taken not to bore thru the piece. For this purpose an  auger-bit-gage, Fig. 219, p. 116, may be used, or a block of wood of  the proper length thru which a hole has been bored, may be slipped  over the bit, or the length of bit may be noted before boring, and  then the length of the projecting portion deducted, or the number of  turns needed to reach the required depth may be counted on a trial  piece. Tying a string around a bit, or making a chalk mark on it is  folly.    [Illustration: Fig. 137. Using a Try-Square as a Guide in Boring.]    Auger-bits are sharpened with an auger-bit file, Fig. 142, p. 90, a  small flat file with two narrow safe edges at one end and two wide  safe edges at the other. The \"nibs\" should be filed on the inside so  that the diameter of the cut may remain as large as that of the body  of the bit. The cutting lip should be sharpened from the side toward  the spur, care being taken to preserve the original angle so as to  give clearance. If sharpened from the upper side, that is, the side  toward the shank, the nibs will tend to become shorter.    The _plug-cutter_, Fig. 131, is useful for cutting plugs with which to  cover the heads of screws that are deeply countersunk.    _Center-bits_, Fig. 132, work on the same principle as auger-bits,  except that the spurs have no screw, and hence have to be pushed  forcibly into the wood. Sizes are given in 16ths of an inch. They are  useful for soft wood, and in boring large holes in thin material which  is likely to split. They are sharpened in the same way as auger-bits.    _Foerstner bits_, Fig. 133, are peculiar in having no spur, but  are centered by a sharp edge around the circumference. The size is  indicated on the tang, in 16ths of an inch. They are useful in boring  into end grain, and in boring part way into wood so thin that a spur  would pierce thru. They can be sharpened only with special appliances.    _Expansive-bits_, Fig. 134, are so made as to bore holes of different  sizes by adjusting the movable nib and cutter. There are two sizes,  the small one with two cutters, boring from 1/2\" to 1-1/2\" and the  large one with three cutters boring from 7/8\" to 4\". They are very  useful on particular occasions, but have to be used with care.    _Reamers_, Fig. 135, are used for enlarging holes already made. They  are made square, half-round and six cornered in shape.    _Countersinks_, Fig. 136, are reamers in the shape of a flat cone, and  are used to make holes for the heads of screws. The rose countersink  is the most satisfactory form.    [Illustration: Fig. 138. Washer-Cutter.]    The _washer-cutter_, Fig. 138, is useful not only for cutting  out washers but also for cutting holes in thin wood. The size is  adjustable.      3. CHOPPING TOOLS.    The primitive celt, which was hardly more than a wedge, has been  differentiated into three modern hand tools, the _chisel_, see above,  p. 53, the _ax_, Fig. 139, and the _adze_, Fig. 141.    The _ax_ has also been differentiated into the _hatchet_, with a short  handle, for use with one hand, while the ax-handle is long, for use  with two hands. Its shape is an adaption to its manner of use. It is  oval in order to be strongest in the direction of the blow and also  in order that the axman may feel and guide the direction of the blade.  The curve at the end is to avoid the awkward raising of the left  hand at the moment of striking the blow, and the knob keeps it from  slipping thru the hand. In both ax and hatchet there is a two-beveled  edge. This is for the sake of facility in cutting into the wood at any  angle.    There are two principal forms, the common ax and the two bitted ax,  the latter used chiefly in lumbering. There is also a wedge-shaped ax  for splitting wood. As among all tools, there is among axes a great  variety for special uses.    [Illustration: Fig. 139. Ax.]    [Illustration: Fig. 140. Shingling Hatchet.]    [Illustration: Fig. 141. Carpenter's Adze.]    The _hatchet_ has, beside the cutting edge, a head for driving nails,  and a notch for drawing them, thus combining three tools in one. The  shingling hatchet, Fig. 140, is a type of this.    The _adze_, the carpenter's house adze, Fig. 141, is flat on the lower  side, since its use is for straightening surfaces.

We know  nothing of the interior of families but by report, and have no share in  those numerous occurrences of life in which the amiable parts of  character are most exhibited.\" \"Missionaries of a different  religion,[54] judges, police-magistrates, officers of revenue or  customs, and even diplomatists, do not see the most virtuous portion of  a nation, nor any portion, unless when influenced by passion, or  occupied by some personal interest. What we _do_ see we judge by our own  standard. We conclude that a man who cries like a child on slight  occasions must always be incapable of acting or suffering with dignity;  and that one who allows himself to be called a liar would not be ashamed  of any baseness. Our writers also confound the distinctions of time and  place; they combine in one character the Maratta and the Bengalese, and  tax the present generation with the crimes of the heroes of the  Mahabharata. It might be argued, in opposition to many unfavorable  testimonies, that those who have known the Indians longest have always  the best opinion of them; but this is rather a compliment to human  nature than to them, since it is true of every other people. It is more  in point, that all persons who have retired from India think better of  the people they have left, after comparing them with others, even of the  most justly-admired nations.\"    But what is still more extraordinary than the ready acceptance of  judgments unfavorable to the character of the Hindus, is the  determined way in which public opinion, swayed by the statements of  certain unfavorable critics, has persistently ignored the evidence  which members of the Civil Service, officers and statesmen--men of the  highest authority--have given again and again, in direct opposition to  these unfavorable opinions.    Here, too, I must ask to be allowed to quote at least a few of these  witnesses on the other side.    Warren Hastings thus speaks of the Hindus in general: \"They are gentle  and benevolent, more susceptible of gratitude for kindness shown them,  and less prompted to vengeance for wrongs inflicted than any people on  the face of the earth; faithful, affectionate, submissive to legal  authority.\"    Bishop Heber said: \"The Hindus are brave, courteous, intelligent, most  eager for knowledge and improvement; sober, industrious, dutiful to  parents, affectionate to their children, uniformly gentle and patient,  and more easily affected by kindness and attention to their wants and  feelings than any people I ever met with.\"[55]    Elphinstone states: \"No set of people among the Hindus are so depraved  as the dregs of our own great towns. The villagers are everywhere  amiable, affectionate to their families, kind to their neighbors, and  toward all but the government honest and sincere. Including the Thugs  and Dacoits, the mass of crime is less in India than in England. The  Thugs are almost a separate nation, and the Dacoits are desperate  ruffians in gangs. The Hindus are mild and gentle people, more  merciful to prisoners than any other Asiatics. Their freedom from  gross debauchery is the point in which they appear to most advantage;  and their superiority in purity of manners is not flattering to our  self-esteem.\"[56]    Yet Elphinstone can be most severe on the real faults of the people of  India. He states that, at present, want of veracity is one of their  prominent vices, but he adds[57] \"that such deceit is most common in  people connected with government, a class which spreads far in India,  as, from the nature of the land-revenue, the lowest villager is often  obliged to resist force by fraud.\"[58]    Sir John Malcolm writes:[59] \"I have hardly ever known where a person  did understand the language, or where a calm communication was made to  a native of India, through a well-informed and trustworthy medium,  that the result did not prove, that what had at first been stated as  falsehood had either proceeded from fear or from misapprehension. I by  no means wish to state that our Indian subjects are more free from  this vice than other nations that occupy a nearly equal position in  society, but I am positive that they are not more addicted to  untruth.\"    Sir Thomas Munro bears even stronger testimony. He writes:[60] \"If a  good system of agriculture, unrivalled manufacturing skill, a capacity  to produce whatever can contribute to either convenience or luxury,  schools established in every village for teaching reading, writing,  and arithmetic,[61] the general practice of hospitality and charity  among each other, and, above all, a treatment of the female sex full  of confidence, respect, and delicacy, are among the signs which  denote a civilized people--then the Hindus are not inferior to the  nations of Europe--and if civilization is to become an article of  trade between England and India, I am convinced that England will gain  by the import cargo.\"    My own experience with regard to the native character has been, of  course, very limited. Those Hindus whom I have had the pleasure to  know personally in Europe may be looked upon as exceptional, as the  best specimens, it may be, that India could produce. Also, my  intercourse with them has naturally been such that it could hardly  have brought out the darker sides of human nature. During the last  twenty years, however, I have had some excellent opportunities of  watching a number of native scholars under circumstances where it is  not difficult to detect a man's true character--I mean in literary  work and, more particularly, in literary controversy. I have watched  them carrying on such controversies both among themselves and with  certain European scholars, and I feel bound to say that, with hardly  one exception, they have displayed a far greater respect for truth and  a far more manly and generous spirit than we are accustomed to even in  Europe and America. They have shown strength, but no rudeness; nay, I  know that nothing has surprised them so much as the coarse invective  to which certain Sanskrit scholars have condescended, rudeness of  speech being, according to their view of human nature, a safe sign not  only of bad breeding, but of want of knowledge. When they were wrong,  they have readily admitted their mistakes; when they were right, they  have never sneered at their European adversaries. There has been,  with few exceptions, no quibbling, no special pleading, no  untruthfulness on their part, and certainly none of that low cunning  of the scholar who writes down and publishes what he knows perfectly  well to be false, and snaps his fingers at those who still value truth  and self-respect more highly than victory or applause at any price.  Here, too, we might possibly gain by the import cargo.    Let me add that I have been repeatedly told by English merchants that  commercial honor stands higher in India than in any other country, and  that a dishonored bill is hardly known there.    I have left to the last the witnesses who might otherwise have been  suspected--I mean the Hindus themselves. The whole of their literature  from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and  reverence for truth. Their very word for truth is full of meaning. It  is s a t or s a t y a, s a t being the participle of the verb _as_, to be.  True, therefore, was with them simply _that which is_. The English  _sooth_ is connected with sat, also the Greek [Greek: on] for  [Greek: _eson_], and the Latin _sens_, in _praesens_.    We are all very apt to consider truth to be what is trowed by others,  or believed in by large majorities. That kind of truth is easy to  accept. But whoever has once stood alone, surrounded by noisy  assertions, and overwhelmed by the clamor of those who ought to know  better, or perhaps who did know better--call him Galileo or Darwin,  Colenso or Stanley, or any other name--he knows what a real delight it  is to feel in his heart of hearts, this is true--this is--this is  s a t--whatever daily, weekly, or quarterly papers, whatever bishops,  archbishops, or popes, may say to the contrary.    Another name for truth is the Sanskrit _r i_t a, which originally seems  to have meant _straight_, _direct_, while a n_r i_t a is untrue, false.    Now one of the highest praises bestowed upon the gods in the Veda is  that they are s a t y a, true, truthful, trustworthy;[62] and it is well  known that both in modern and ancient times, men always ascribe to God  or to their gods those qualities which they value most in themselves.    Other words applied to the gods as truthful beings are, a d r o g h a,  lit. not deceiving.[63] A d r o g h a-v a _k_ means, he whose word is  never broken. Thus Indra, the Vedic Jupiter, is said to have been  praised by the fathers[64] \"as reaching the enemy, overcoming him,  standing on the summit, _true of speech_, most powerful in thought.\"    D r o g h a v a _k_,[65] on the contrary, is used for deceitful men. Thus  Vasish_th_a, one of the great Vedic poets, says: \"If I had worshipped  false gods, or if I believed in the gods vainly--but why art thou  angry with us, O _G_atavedas? May liars go to destruction!\"    S a t y a m, as a neuter, is often used as an abstract, and is then  rightly translated by truth. But it also means that which is, the true,  the real; and there are several passages in the Rig-Veda where, instead  of _truth_, I think we ought simply to translate s a t y a m by the  true, that is, the real, [Greek: to ontos on].[66] It sounds, no doubt,  very well to translate Satyena uttabhita bhumi_h_ by \"the earth is  founded on truth;\" and I believe every translator has taken s a t y a in  that sense here. Ludwig translates, \"Von der Wahrheit ist die Erde  gestuetzt.\" But such an idea, if it conveys any tangible meaning at all,  is far too"]]]
