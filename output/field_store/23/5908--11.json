Canada was to pay most dearly in later years, as these pages will show,  for the alliance Champlain made with the inveterate enemies of the  ablest and bravest Indians of North America.  Nowhere in his own  narrative of his doings in the colony does he give us an inkling of the  motives that influenced him.  We may, however, fairly believe that he  underrated the strength and warlike qualities of the Iroquois, and  believed that the allied nations of Canada would sooner or later, with  his assistance, win the victory.  If he had shown any hesitation to  ally himself with the Indians of Canada, he might have hazarded the  fortunes, and even ruined the fur-trade which was the sole basis of the  little colony's existence for many years.  The dominating purpose of  his life in Canada, it is necessary to remember, was the exploration of  the unknown region to which the rivers and lakes of Canada led, and  that could never have been attempted, had he by any cold or  unsympathetic conduct alienated the Indians who guarded the waterways  over which he had to pass before he could unveil the mysteries of the  western wilderness.    In the month of June Champlain and several Frenchmen commenced their  ascent of the Richelieu in a large boat, in company with several bark  canoes filled with sixty Canadian Indians.  When they reached the  rapids near the lovely basin of Chambly--named after a French officer  and seignior in later times--the French boat could not be taken any  {73} further.  It was sent back to Quebec while Champlain and two  others, armed with the arquebus, a short gun with a matchlock, followed  the Indians through the woods to avoid this dangerous part of the  river.  The party soon reached the safe waters of the Richelieu and  embarked once more in their canoes.  For the first time Champlain had  abundant opportunities to note the customs of the Indians on a  war-path, their appeals to evil spirits to help them against their  enemies, their faith in dreams, and their methods of marching in a  hostile country.  The party passed into the beautiful lake which has  ever since that day borne the great Frenchman's name; they saw its  numerous islets, the Adirondacks in the west, and the Green Mountains  in the east.  Paddling cautiously for some nights along the western  shore, they reached at last on the evening of the 29th of July a point  of land, identified in later days as the site of Ticonderoga, so  celebrated in the military annals of America.  Here they found a party  of Iroquois, who received them with shouts of defiance, but retreated  to the woods for the night with the understanding on both sides that  the fight would take place as soon as the sun rose next morning.  The  allies remained in their canoes, dancing, singing, and hurling insults  at their foes, who did not fail to respond with similar demonstrations.    Next morning, two hundred stalwart Iroquois warriors, led by three  chiefs with conspicuous plumes, marched from their barricade of logs  and were met by the Canadian Indians.  Champlain immediately fired on  the chiefs with such success that two of {74} them fell dead and the  other was wounded and died later.  \"Our Indians,\" writes Champlain,  \"shouted triumphantly, and then the arrows began to fly furiously from  both parties.  The Iroquois were clearly amazed that two chiefs should  have been so suddenly killed although they were protected from arrows  by a sort of armour made of strong twigs and filled with cotton.  While  I was reloading, one of my men, who was not seen by the enemy, fired a  shot from the woods and so frightened the Iroquois, no longer led by  their chiefs, that they lost courage and fled precipitately into the  forest, where we followed and succeeded in killing a number and taking  ten or twelve prisoners.  On our side only ten or fifteen were wounded,  and they very soon recovered.\"    On their return to the St. Lawrence, the Indians gave Champlain an  illustration of their cruelty towards their captives.  When they had  harangued the Iroquois and narrated some of the tortures that his  nation had inflicted on the Canadians in previous times, he was told to  sing, and when he did so, as Champlain naively says, \"the song was sad  to hear.\"    A fire was lit, and when it was very hot, the Indians seized a burning  brand and applied it to the naked body of their victim, who was tied to  a tree.  Sometimes they poured water on his wounds, tore off his nails,  and poured hot gum on his head from which they had cut the scalp.  They  opened his arm near the wrists, and pulled at his tendons and when they  would not come off, they used their knives.  The poor wretch was forced  to cry out now and then in his agony, and it made Champlain {75}  heart-sick to see him so maltreated, but generally he exhibited so much  courage and stoicism that he seemed as if he were not suffering at all.  Champlain remonstrated with them, and was at last allowed to put a  speedy end to the sufferings of the unhappy warrior.  But even when he  was dead, they cut the body into pieces and attempted to make the  brother of the victim swallow his heart.  Champlain might well say that  it was better for an Indian to die on the battlefield or kill himself  when wounded, than fall into the hands of such merciless enemies.    Soon after this memorable episode in the history of Canada, Champlain  crossed the ocean to consult De Monts, who could not persuade the king  and his minister to grant him a renewal of his charter.  The merchants  of the seaboard had combined to represent the injury the trade of the  kingdom would sustain by continuing a monopoly of Canadian furs.  De  Monts, however, made the best arrangements he could under such  unfavourable conditions, and Champlain returned to the St. Lawrence in  the spring of 1610.  During the summer he assisted the Canadian allies  in a successful assault on a large body of the Iroquois who had raised  a fortification at the mouth of the Richelieu, and all of whom were  killed.  It was on this occasion, when a large number of Canadian  nations were assembled, that he commenced the useful experiment of  sending Frenchmen into the Ottawa valley to learn the customs and  language of the natives, and act as interpreters afterwards.    The French at Quebec heard of the assassination {76} of Henry the  Fourth who had been a friend of the colony.  Champlain went to France  in the autumn of 1610, and returned to Canada in the following spring.  In the course of the summer he passed some days on the island of Mont  Royal where he proposed establishing a post where the allied nations  could meet for purposes of trade and consultation, as he told the  Ottawa Indians at a later time when he was in their country.  He made a  clearing on a little point to which he gave the name of Place Royale,  now known as Pointe-a-Callieres, on a portion of which the hospital of  the Grey Nuns was subsequently built.  It was not, however, until  thirty years later that the first permanent settlement was made on the  island, and the foundations laid of the great city which was first  named Ville-Marie.    During the next twenty-four years Champlain passed some months in  France at different times, according to the exigencies of the colony.  One of the most important changes he brought about was the formation of  a new commercial association, for the purpose of reconciling rival  mercantile interests.  To give strength and dignity to the enterprise,  the Count de Soissons, Charles of Bourbon, one of the royal sons of  France, was placed at the head, but he died suddenly, and was replaced  by Prince de Conde, Henry of Bourbon, also a royal prince, best known  as the father of the victor of Rocroy, and the opponent of Marie de'  Medici during her intrigues with Spain.  It was in this same year that  he entered into an engagement with a rich Calvinist, Nicholas Boulle,  to marry his daughter Helen, then a child, {77} when she had arrived at  a suitable age, on the condition that the father would supply funds to  help the French in their Canadian experiment.  The marriage was not  consummated until ten years later, and Champlain's wife, whose  Christian name he gave to the pretty islet opposite Montreal harbour,  spent four years in the settlement.  The happiness of a domestic life  was not possible in those early Canadian days, and a gentle French girl  probably soon found herself a mere luxury amid the savagery of her  surroundings.  Helen Champlain has no place in this narrative, and we  leave her with the remark that she was converted by her husband, and on  his death retired to the seclusion of an Ursuline convent in France.  No child was born to bear the name and possibly increase the fame of  Champlain.    On his return to Canada, in the spring of 1613, Champlain decided to  explore the western waters of Canada.  L'Escarbot, who published his  \"New France,\" soon after his return from Acadia, tells us that  \"Champlain promised never to cease his efforts until he has found there  [in Canada] a western or northern sea opening up the route to China  which so many have so far sought in vain.\"  While at Paris, during the  winter of 1612, Champlain saw a map which gave him some idea of the  great sea which Hudson had discovered.  At the same time he heard from  a Frenchman, Nicholas de Vignau, who had come to Paris direct from the  Ottawa valley, that while among the Algonquin Indians he had gone with  a party to the north where they had found a salt water sea, on whose  shores were the remains {78} of an English ship.  The Indians had also,  according to Vignau, brought back an English lad, whom they intended to  present to Champlain when he made his promised visit to the Upper  Ottawa.    Champlain probably thought he was at last to realise the dream of his  life.

There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat;  but I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under _any_ cir'stances.\"    \"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten. \"They are  no bigger than mice, and I'm sure mice are proper for me to eat.\"    \"It isn't the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl. \"These  are Mr. Wizard's pets, just as you are my pet, and it wouldn't be any  more proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you.\"    \"And that's just what I shall do if you don't let those little balls of  pork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes.  \"If you injure any one of them I'll chew you up instantly.\"    The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decide  whether he meant it or not.    \"In that case,\" she said, \"I'll leave them alone. You haven't many teeth  left, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. So  the piglets will be perfectly safe, hereafter, as far as I am  concerned.\"    \"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the Wizard, earnestly. \"Let us all be  a happy family and love one another.\"    Eureka yawned and stretched herself.    \"I've always loved the piglets,\" she said; \"but they don't love me.\"    \"No one can love a person he's afraid of,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If you  behave, and don't scare the little pigs, I'm sure they'll grow very fond  of you.\"    The Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and the  journey was resumed.    \"We must be pretty near the top, now,\" said the boy, as they climbed  wearily up the dark, winding stairway.    \"The Country of the Gurgles can't be far from the top of the earth,\"  remarked Dorothy. \"It isn't very nice down here. I'd like to get home  again, I'm sure.\"    No one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breath  for the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard  often had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keep  it from jamming against the rocky walls.    At last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew clearer  and stronger as they advanced.    \"Thank goodness we're nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard.    Jim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck his  head above the rocky sides of the stairway. Then he halted, ducked down  and began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the  others.    \"Let's go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice.    \"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard. \"What's the matter with you, old  man?\"    \"Everything,\" grumbled the horse. \"I've taken a look at this place, and  it's no fit country for real creatures to go to. Everything's dead, up  there--no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere.\"    \"Never mind; we can't turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don't intend to  stay there, anyhow.\"    \"It's dangerous,\" growled Jim, in a stubborn tone.    \"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and I  have been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escaped  without harm. We've even been to the marvelous Land of Oz--haven't we,  Dorothy?--so we don't much care what the Country of the Gargoyles is  like. Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we'll make the best of it.\"    \"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;  so if you get into trouble don't blame me.\"    With this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining  steps. The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad  platform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes  had ever beheld.    \"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so it  was. The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard  knots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. There were odd wooden  houses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards. The tree-trunks  were of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings. The  patches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass nor  sawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring. Wooden birds fluttered  among the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; but  the most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the creatures  known as Gargoyles.    These were very numerous, for the palace was thickly inhabited, and a  large group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon the  strangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway.    The Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet in  height. Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and their  arms extraordinarily long and stout. Their heads were too big for their  bodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon. Some had long,  curved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths. Others had  flat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of an  elephant. There were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; but  all were equally disagreeable in appearance. The tops of their heads had  no hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some having  a row of points or balls around the top, other designs resembling  flowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked like  waffles cut criss-cross on their heads. They all wore short wooden wings  which were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges  with wooden screws, and with these wings they flew swiftly and  noiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them.    This noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the  Gargoyles. They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying to  speak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with  their wooden fingers or lips. Neither was there any sound to be heard  anywhere throughout the wooden country. The birds did not sing, nor did  the cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere.    The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near  the stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evil  eyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land. In  turn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined the  Gargoyles with the same silent attention.    \"There's going to be trouble, I'm sure,\" remarked the horse. \"Unhitch  those tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fight  comfortably.\"    \"Jim's right,\" sighed the Wizard. \"There's going to be trouble, and my  sword isn't stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall have  to get out my revolvers.\"    He got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadly  looking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to  look at.    \"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy. \"They have no weapons to  hurt us with.\"    \"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and I'm  sure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes. Even these  revolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies,  and after that we will be at their mercy.\"    \"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl.    \"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely.  \"It's every man's duty to do the best he knows how; and I'm going to do  it.\"    \"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse.    \"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along several  other useful things,\" responded the Wizard. \"But we dropped into this  adventure rather unexpectedly.\"    The Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of  talking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words  seemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as the  conversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and  flew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before  them like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats. The horse had  especially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and  strangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their  first attack.    But Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned his  heels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could. Crack!  crash! bang! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the  Gargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force that  they scattered like straws in the wind. But the noise and clatter seemed  as dreadful to them as Jim's heels, for all who were able swiftly turned  and flew away to a great distance. The others picked themselves up from  the ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for a  moment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease.    But the Wizard was not so confident.    \"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all the  damage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their noses  and ears. That cannot make them look any uglier, I'm sure, and it is my  opinion they will soon renew the attack.\"    \"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy.    \"The noise, of course. Don't you remember how the Champion escaped them  by shouting his battle-cry?\"    \"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the boy. \"We have  time, just now, and I'd rather "]]]
