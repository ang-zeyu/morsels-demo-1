The reading of one cheers  me up for the day. Cyrilla Blair, what is the matter? You nearly  frightened me to death!\" Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the  centre of the floor, waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air.    \"Girls, I have an inspiration!\" she exclaimed.    \"Good! Let's hear it,\" said Carol.    \"Let's write letters--rainy-day letters--to everyone in the house,\"  said Cyrilla. \"You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs.  Plunkett's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely  too, as well as ourselves. Let's write them the jolliest, nicest  letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms.  There's that pale little sewing girl, I don't believe she ever gets  letters from anybody, and Miss Marshall, I'm sure _she_ doesn't, and  poor old Mrs. Johnson, whose only son died last month, and the new  music teacher who came yesterday, a letter of welcome to her--and old  Mr. Grant, yes, and Mrs. Plunkett too, thanking her for all her  kindness to us. You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of  the oil stove ukase. That's six--two apiece. Let's do it, girls.\"    Cyrilla's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others.    \"It's a nice idea,\" said Mary, brightening up. \"But who's to write to  whom? I'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall. I couldn't write  a line to her to save my life. She'd be horrified at anything funny or  jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense--nonsense of the  best brand, to be sure, but still nonsense.\"    \"Better leave Miss Marshall out,\" suggested Carol. \"You know she  disapproves of us anyhow. She'd probably resent a letter of the sort,  thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her.\"    \"It would never do to leave her out,\" said Cyrilla decisively. \"Of  course, she's a bit queer and unamiable, but, girls, think of thirty  years of boarding-house life, even with the best of Plunketts.  Wouldn't that sour anybody? You know it would. You'd be cranky and  grumbly and disagreeable too, I dare say. I'm really sorry for Miss  Marshall. She's had a very hard life. Mrs. Plunkett told me all about  her one day. I don't think we should mind her biting little speeches  and sharp looks. And anyway, even if she is really as disagreeable as  she sometimes seems to be, why, it must make it all the harder for  her, don't you think? So she needs a letter most of all. I'll write to  her, since it's my suggestion. We'll draw lots for the others.\"    Besides Miss Marshall, the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla's share.  Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker, and Carol drew Mrs.  Johnson and old Mr. Grant. For the next two hours the girls wrote  busily, forgetting all about the rainy day, and enjoying their  epistolary labours to the full. It was dusk when all the letters were  finished.    \"Why, hasn't the afternoon gone quickly after all!\" exclaimed Carol.  \"I just let my pen run on and jotted down any good working idea that  came into my head. Cyrilla Blair, that big fat letter is never for  Miss Marshall! What on earth did you find to write her?\"    \"It wasn't so hard when I got fairly started,\" said Cyrilla, smiling.  \"Now, let's hunt up Nora Jane and send the letters around so that  everybody can read his or hers before tea-time. We should have a  choice assortment of smiles at the table instead of all those frowns  and sighs we had at dinner.\" Miss Emily Marshall was at that moment  sitting in her little back room, all alone in the dusk, with the rain  splashing drearily against the windowpanes outside. Miss Marshall was  feeling as lonely and dreary as she looked--and as she had often felt  in her life of sixty years. She told herself bitterly that she hadn't  a friend in the world--not even one who cared enough for her to come  and see her or write her a letter now and then. She thought her  boarding-house acquaintances disliked her and she resented their  dislike, without admitting to herself that her ungracious ways were  responsible for it. She smiled sourly when little ripples of laughter  came faintly down the hall from the front room where The Trio were  writing their letters and laughing over the fun they were putting into  them.    \"If they were old and lonesome and friendless they wouldn't see much  in life to laugh at, I guess,\" said Miss Marshall bitterly, drawing  her shawl closer about her sharp shoulders. \"They never think of  anything but themselves and if a day passes that they don't have 'some  fun' they think it's a fearful thing to put up with. I'm sick and  tired of their giggling and whispering.\"    In the midst of these amiable reflections Miss Marshall heard a knock  at her door. When she opened it there stood Nora Jane, her broad red  face beaming with smiles.    \"Please, Miss, here's a letter for you,\" she said.    \"A letter for me!\" Miss Marshall shut her door and stared at the fat  envelope in amazement. Who could have written it? The postman came  only in the morning. Was it some joke, perhaps? Those giggling girls?  Miss Marshall's face grew harder as she lighted her lamp and opened  the letter suspiciously.    \"Dear Miss Marshall,\" it ran in Cyrilla's pretty girlish writing, \"we  girls are so lonesome and dull that we have decided to write rainy-day  letters to everybody in the house just to cheer ourselves up. So I'm  going to write to you just a letter of friendly nonsense.\"    Pages of \"nonsense\" followed, and very delightful nonsense it was, for  Cyrilla possessed the happy gift of bright and easy letter-writing.  She commented wittily on all the amusing episodes of the  boarding-house life for the past month; she described a cat-fight she  had witnessed from her window that morning and illustrated it by a  pen-and-ink sketch of the belligerent felines; she described a lovely  new dress her mother had sent her from home and told all about the  class party to which she had worn it; she gave an account of her  vacation camping trip to the mountains and pasted on one page a number  of small snapshots taken during the outing; she copied a joke she had  read in the paper that morning and discussed the serial story in the  boarding-house magazine which all the boarders were reading; she wrote  out the directions for a new crocheted tidy her sister had made--Miss  Marshall had a mania for crocheting; and she finally wound up with  \"all the good will and good wishes that Nora Jane will consent to  carry from your friend, Cyrilla Blair.\"    Before Miss Marshall had finished reading that letter she had cried  three times and laughed times past counting. More tears came at the  end--happy, tender tears such as Miss Marshall had not shed for years.  Something warm and sweet and gentle seemed to thrill to life within  her heart. So those girls were not such selfish, heedless young  creatures as she had supposed! How kind it had been in Cyrilla Blair  to think of her and write so to her. She no longer felt lonely and  neglected. Her whole sombre world had been brightened to sunshine by  that merry friendly letter.    Mrs. Plunkett's table was surrounded by a ring of smiling faces that  night. Everybody seemed in good spirits in spite of the weather. The  pale little dressmaker, who had hardly uttered a word since her  arrival a week before, talked and laughed quite merrily and girlishly,  thanking Cyrilla unreservedly for her \"jolly letter.\" Old Mr. Grant  did not grumble once about the rain or the food or his rheumatism and  he told Carol that she might be a good letter writer in time if she  looked after her grammar more carefully--which, from Mr. Grant, was  high praise. All the others declared that they were delighted with  their letters--all except Miss Marshall. She said nothing but later  on, when Cyrilla was going upstairs, she met Miss Marshall in the  shadows of the second landing.    \"My dear,\" said Miss Marshall gently, \"I want to thank you for your  letter, I don't think you can realize just what it has meant to me. I  was so--so lonely and tired and discouraged. It heartened me right up.  I--I know you have thought me a cross and disagreeable person. I'm  afraid I have been, too. But--but--I shall try to be less so in  future. If I can't succeed all at once don't mind me because, under it  all, I shall always be your friend. And I mean to keep your letter and  read it over every time I feel myself getting bitter and hard again.\"  \"Dear Miss Marshall, I'm so glad you liked it,\" said Cyrilla frankly.  \"We're all your friends and would be glad to be chummy with you. Only  we thought perhaps we bothered you with our nonsense.\"    \"Come and see me sometimes,\" said Miss Marshall with a smile. \"I'll  try to be 'chummy'--perhaps I'm not yet too old to learn the secret of  friendliness. Your letter has made me think that I have missed much in  shutting all young life out from mine as I have done. I want to reform  in this respect if I can.\"    When Cyrilla reached the front room she found Mrs. Plunkett there.    \"I've just dropped in, Miss Blair,\" said that worthy woman, \"to say  that I dunno as I mind your making candy once in a while if you want  to. Only do be careful not to set the place on fire. Please be  _particularly_ careful not to set it on fire.\"    \"We'll try,\" promised Cyrilla with dancing eyes. When the door closed  behind Mrs. Plunkett the three girls looked at each other.    \"Cyrilla, that idea of yours was a really truly inspiration,\" said  Carol solemnly.    \"I believe it was,\" said Cyrilla, thinking of Miss Marshall.          Dorinda's Desperate Deed      Dorinda had been home for a whole wonderful week and the little Pages  were beginning to feel acquainted with her. When a girl goes away when  she is ten and doesn't come back until she is fifteen, it is only to  be expected that her family should regard her as somewhat of a  stranger, especially when she is really a Page, and they are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#13)"],[1,":    \"I hope you won't mention this to anyone, Melissa. I don't mind  marrying Isaac, but I don't want people to know how it came about.\"    \"Oh, I won't say anything about it,\" said Melissa, laughing a little  disagreeably.    \"Because,\" I said, to clinch the matter, looking significantly at her  front hair as I said it, \"I have something to tell, too.\"    Melissa will hold her tongue.          By the Rule of Contrary      \"Look here, Burton,\" said old John Ellis in an ominous tone of voice,  \"I want to know if what that old busybody of a Mary Keane came here  today gossiping about is true. If it is--well, I've something to say  about the matter! Have you been courting that niece of Susan Oliver's  all summer on the sly?\"    Burton Ellis's handsome, boyish face flushed darkly crimson to the  roots of his curly black hair. Something in the father's tone roused  anger and rebellion in the son. He straightened himself up from the  turnip row he was hoeing, looked his father squarely in the face, and  said quietly,    \"Not on the sly, sir, I never do things that way. But I have been  going to see Madge Oliver for some time, and we are engaged. We are  thinking of being married this fall, and we hope you will not object.\"    Burton's frankness nearly took away his father's breath. Old John  fairly choked with rage.    \"You young fool,\" he spluttered, bringing down his hoe with such  energy that he sliced off half a dozen of his finest young turnip  plants, \"have you gone clean crazy? No, sir, I'll never consent to  your marrying an Oliver, and you needn't have any idea that I will.\"    \"Then I'll marry her without your consent,\" retorted Burton angrily,  losing the temper he had been trying to keep.    \"Oh, will you indeed! Well, if you do, out you go, and not a cent of  my money or a rod of my land do you ever get.\"    \"What have you got against Madge?\" asked Burton, forcing himself to  speak calmly, for he knew his father too well to doubt for a minute  that he meant and would do just what he said.    \"She's an Oliver,\" said old John crustily, \"and that's enough.\" And  considering that he had settled the matter, John Ellis threw down his  hoe and left the field in a towering rage.    Burton hoed away savagely until his anger had spent itself on the  weeds. Give up Madge--dear, sweet little Madge? Not he! Yet if his  father remained of the same mind, their marriage was out of the  question at present. And Burton knew quite well that his father would  remain of the same mind. Old John Ellis had the reputation of being  the most contrary man in Greenwood.    When Burton had finished his row he left the turnip field and went  straight across lots to see Madge and tell her his dismal story. An  hour later Miss Susan Oliver went up the stairs of her little brown  house to Madge's room and found her niece lying on the bed, her pretty  curls tumbled, her soft cheeks flushed crimson, crying as if her heart  would break.    Miss Susan was a tall, grim, angular spinster who looked like the last  person in the world to whom a love affair might be confided. But never  were appearances more deceptive than in this case. Behind her  unprepossessing exterior Miss Susan had a warm, sympathetic heart  filled to the brim with kindly affection for her pretty niece. She had  seen Burton Ellis going moodily across the fields homeward and guessed  that something had gone wrong.    \"Now, dearie, what is the matter?\" she said, tenderly patting the  brown head.    Madge sobbed out the whole story disconsolately. Burton's father would  not let him marry her because she was an Oliver. And, oh, what would  she do?    \"Don't worry, Madge,\" said Miss Susan comfortingly. \"I'll soon settle  old John Ellis.\"    \"Why, what can you do?\" asked Madge forlornly.    Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused.    \"You'll see. I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself. He is  the most contrary man the Lord ever made. I went to school with him. I  learned how to manage him then, and I haven't forgotten how. I'm going  straight up to interview him.\"    \"Are you sure that will do any good?\" said Madge doubtfully. \"If you  go to him and take Burton's and my part, won't it only make him  worse?\"    \"Madge, dear,\" said Miss Susan, busily twisting her scanty, iron-grey  hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge's  glass, \"you just wait. I'm not young, and I'm not pretty, and I'm not  in love, but I've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will  have. You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something.  You'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis.\"    Burton had returned to the turnip field, but old John Ellis was taking  his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of  his house. Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a  cutting sarcasm contained therein, he saw a tall, angular figure  coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and  flutter of shawl and skirt.    \"Old Susan Oliver, as sure as a gun,\" said old John with another  chuckle. \"She looks mad clean through. I suppose she's coming here to  blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers. She's  been angling and scheming for it for years, but she will find who she  has to deal with. Come on, Miss Susan.\"    John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile.    Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them. She did  indeed look angry and disturbed. Without any preliminary greeting she  burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe's  breath.    \"Look here, John Ellis, I want to know what this means. I've  discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours, who ought to be  in short trousers yet, has been courting my niece, Madge Oliver, all  summer. He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry  her. I won't have it, I tell you, and you can tell your son so. Marry  my niece indeed! A pretty pass the world is coming to! I'll never  consent to it.\"    Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts  thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and  taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment, but I doubt it.  The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the  Ellis contrariness was roused.    \"What have you got to say against my son?\" he fairly shouted in his  rage. \"Isn't he good enough for your girl, Susan Oliver, I'd like to  know?\"    \"No, he isn't,\" retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly.  \"He's well enough in his place, but you'll please to remember, John  Ellis, that my niece is an Oliver, and the Olivers don't marry beneath  them.\"    Old John was furious. \"Beneath them indeed! Why, woman, it is  condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece--condescension,  that is what it is. You are as poor as church mice.\"    \"We come of good family, though,\" retorted Miss Susan. \"You Ellises  are nobodies. Your grandfather was a hired man! And yet you have the  presumption to think you're fit to marry into an old, respectable  family like the Olivers. But talking doesn't signify. I simply won't  allow this nonsense to go on. I came here today to tell you so plump  and plain. It's your duty to stop it; if you don't I will, that's  all.\"    \"Oh, will you?\" John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and  stubbornness now. \"We'll see, Miss Susan, we'll see. My son shall  marry whatever girl he pleases, and I'll back him up in it--do you  hear that? Come here and tell me my son isn't good enough for your  niece indeed! I'll show you he can get her anyway.\"    \"You've heard what I've said,\" was the answer, \"and you'd better go by  it, that's all. I shan't stay to bandy words with you, John Ellis. I'm  going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain, and what I  want her to do, and she'll do it, I haven't a fear.\"    Miss Susan was halfway down the steps, but John Ellis ran to the  railing of the verandah to get the last word.    \"I'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what  _he_ wants her to do, and we'll see whether she'll sooner listen to  you than to him,\" he shouted.    Miss Susan deigned no reply. Old John strode out to the turnip field.  Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath, but  his father's first words almost took away his breath.    \"See here, Burt, I take back all I said this afternoon. I want you to  marry Madge Oliver now, and the sooner, the better. That old cat of a  Susan had the face to come up and tell me you weren't good enough for  her niece. I told her a few plain truths. Don't you mind the old  crosspatch. I'll back you up.\"    By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously, to hide the amused  twinkle of comprehension in his eyes. He admired Miss Susan's tactics,  but he did not say so.    \"All right, Father,\" he answered dutifully.    When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put  on her new pink muslin, because she guessed Burton would be down that  evening.    \"Oh, Auntie, how did you manage it?\" cried Madge.    \"Madge,\" said Miss Susan solemnly, but with dancing eyes, \"do you know  how to drive a pig? Just try to make it go in the opposite direction  and it will bolt the way you want it. Remember that, my dear.\"          Fair Exchange and No Robbery      Katherine Rangely was packing up. Her chum and roommate, Edith Wilmer,  was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion  peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer.    \"It does seem too provoking,\" said Katherine, as she tugged at an  obstinate shawl strap, \"that Ned should be transferred here now, just  when I'm going away. The powers that be might have waited until  vacation was over. Ned won't know a soul here and he'll be horribly  lonesome.\"    \"I'll do my best to befriend him, with your permission,\" said Edith  consolingly.    \"Oh, I know."]]]
