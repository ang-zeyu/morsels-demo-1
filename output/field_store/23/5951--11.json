Should this unfortunately happen,  you must understand that at whatever sacrifice it is imperatively  necessary that her Majesty's forces in Natal and the Transvaal must  be reinforced by the immediate despatch of the military and naval  contingents now operating in the Cape, or such portion of them as  may be required. This is necessary not only for the safety of the  Transvaal, for the defence of which her Majesty's Government are  immediately concerned, but also in the interest of the Cape, since  a defeat of the Zulu king would act more powerfully than any other  means in disheartening the native races of South Africa.\"    On this subject Sir H. Bulwer wrote: \"There has been for the last  eight or nine months a danger of collision with the Zulus at any  moment.\" And in November 1878 he said: \"The system of government in  the Zulu country is so bad that any improvement seems hopeless. We  should, if necessary, be justified in deposing Cetchwayo.\"    Consequently, Sir Bartle Frere was not surprised when all efforts to  reduce Cetchwayo to yield to British demand failed. As time went by  it became clear that enforcement of these demands must be placed in  the hands of Lord Chelmsford and the military authorities, and  accordingly, on the 10th of January 1879, the Commander-in-Chief of  the forces of South Africa crossed the frontier.    As the frontier extended for some two hundred miles, to assume a  purely defensive attitude would have been impossible. Our forces so  placed would not have been sufficiently strong to resist an attack  made at their own time and place by a horde of some ten to twenty  thousand Zulus. Lord Chelmsford had no alternative, therefore, but  to invade Zululand.      ISANDLWANA    The force under Lord Chelmsford's command was divided into four columns.  These were composed partly of British soldiers, partly of Colonists, and  partly of blacks. The first column, under Colonel Pearson, crossed the  Lower Tugela; the second, under Lieutenant-Colonel Durnford, R.E.,  consisting of native troops and Natal Volunteers, was to act in concert  with column three; the third, under Colonel Glyn--but directed by the  General, who assumed all responsibility--crossed the Buffalo River; and  the fourth, under Colonel Evelyn Wood, entered Zululand from near  Newcastle on the north-west. The plan was for the four columns to  converge upon Ulundi, in the neighbourhood of the king's kraal, where  fighting might be expected to begin.    [Illustration: MAP OF ZULULAND AND ADJOINING PORTIONS OF NATAL.]    The crossing of the Buffalo River was effected without difficulty or  resistance, and ten days after the central column formed a camp at  the foot of the hill Isandlwana (the Little Hand). On the morning of  the 22nd the Commander-in-Chief advanced at daybreak, for the  purpose of attacking a kraal some miles distant. The camp at  Isandlwana was left in charge of a force of some eight hundred mixed  troops--regulars, volunteers, and natives. Strict orders to defend  and not to leave the camp were given, but in spite of these orders  portions of the force became detached. Suddenly, unobserved by them,  there appeared a dense impi of some twenty thousand Zulus. The  savage horde rushed shouting upon the small British detachments,  rushed with the swiftness of cavalry, attacked them before they  could unite, and swooping down with tremendous velocity, seized the  camp and separated the British troops from their reserves of  ammunition. In face of this warrior multitude our troops were  defenceless. A few moments of wild despairing energy, a hand-to-hand  struggle for life between the white man and the bloodthirsty savage,  groans of wounded and yells of victory, and all was over. Of the six  companies of the 24th, consisting of more than half the infantry  engaged, but six souls escaped. The rest died where they fell, with  no kindly hand to give them succour, no British voice to breathe a  burial prayer. But some before they dropped managed to cut their way  through the ring of Zulu spears. Two gallant fellows, Lieutenants  Melvill and Coghill, almost succeeded in saving the colours of the  first battalion of the 24th Regiment. They made a bold rush, but  merely reached the Natal bank of the Buffalo to be struck down. The  colours, wrapped round Melvill's body, were discovered in the river  some days afterwards.    The Zulu plan of fighting, in this case so successful, is curious.  The formation of their attacks represents the figure of a beast with  horns, chest, and loins. While making a feint with one horn, the  other, unperceived in long grass or bush, swoops round and closes in  on the enemy. The chest then advances to attack. The loins are kept  at a distance, and simply join in pursuit.    The news of the disaster spread fast. Sir Bartle Frere, on the  morning of the 24th, was awakened by the arrival of two almost  distraught and wholly unintelligible messengers. Their report, when  it could be at last comprehended, seemed too horrible for belief.  That they had escaped some terrible ordeal was evident; that they  were members of the company of naval volunteers that formed part of  the General's army, their uniform proclaimed. But of the General  they could say nothing--he might be dead, he might be missing--all  they knew was of their own miraculous escape from a scene of  slaughter. Colonel Pulleine they declared was dead, but further news  had to be awaited with anxious hearts.    Meanwhile Lord Chelmsford had heard the horrible news. The camp had  been seen in the possession of the Zulus. Worn and weary with heavy  marching in a baking sun, he and his troops began to retreat. At  nightfall, thoroughly jaded, they returned to a grim scene. All  around lay the still silent dead--the corpses of the comrades they  had parted with but a few hours before. There, amid the pathetic  wreckage, were they forced to lay them down to rest!    Fortunately the Zulus, having plundered the camp, had made off, and  the British force was able the next day to proceed to the relief of  Rorke's Drift. At Rorke's Drift the now world-celebrated defence of  Lieutenant Bromhead, of the 24th, and Lieutenant Chard, R.E., took  place. These young officers had been left with one hundred and four  soldiers to take charge of a small depot of provisions and an  hospital, and to keep open the communication with Natal. Some hours  after the disaster of Isandlwana their post was attacked by  Dabulamanzi (brother of Cetchwayo) and over three thousand of his  finest warriors. The little garrison had made for themselves a  laager of sacks of maize and biscuit-boxes, and behind these they  defended themselves so stubbornly and so heroically throughout the  night of the 23rd, that the Zulu chieftain, discomfited and  harassed, eventually retired. For their magnificent pluck the two  young officers received the Victoria Cross. Their action had saved  Natal from invasion by the enemy. Of the little garrison seventeen  fell and ten were wounded. The loss of the Zulus was about three  hundred.    [Illustration: THE DEFENCE OF RORKE'S DRIFT, 22nd to 23rd JANUARY  1879.    Painted by Alphonse de Neuville, Etched by L. Flameng.    Reproduced by special arrangement with the Fine Art Society,  London.]    Colonel Pearson's column, as we said, crossed the Lower Tugela near  the sea, with the intention of joining the other columns at Ulundi.  On the way thither he was attacked by a Zulu force at Inyesani. This  force, though it more than doubled the strength of his own, he drove  back with heavy loss, and marched to the Norwegian Mission station,  Eshowe. On his arrival there on the 23rd of January, he learnt the  awful news of the disaster, and instantly sent his cavalry back to  Natal, fortified his station, and waited there the arrival of  reinforcements.    The third column, commanded by Colonel Evelyn Wood (consisting of  1700 British soldiers, 50 farmers under Commandant Pieter Uys, and  some 300 blacks), reached Kambula in safety, and fortified a post  there. Colonel Wood harassed the enemy by frequent sallies, however,  and on one occasion the attack on the Zlobane Mountain lost about  ninety-six of his men. Among these were Colonel Weatherley, his  young son, and Commandant Uys. The following day the British laager  was attacked by a horde of Zulus, who were routed. In this  engagement Colonel Wood, Colonel Buller, and Captain Woodgate  especially distinguished themselves.    Lord Chelmsford, with a force of soldiers and sailors, marched in  April from Natal to the relief of Colonel Pearson at Eshowe. He  arrived there in safety, after having encountered and beaten back  the Zulus at Ginginlova: yet it was not until the 4th of July that  the troops eventually reached Ulundi, where the final battle and  victory took place. But of this later.      AFFAIRS AT HOME    Two days after the arrival of the news of the disaster at  Isandlwana, Parliament met. The reverse in Zululand naturally  engrossed all thoughts. Questions innumerable were addressed to  Government, as to the strength of reinforcements to be sent out--as  to the further necessity for war at all--as to the so-called  high-handed action of Sir Bartle Frere, and the so-called blunders  of Lord Chelmsford. Scapegoats were wanted, and, as a natural  consequence, the two most energetic and hard-worked of the Queen's  servants were attacked.    A political pitched battle was imminent. The Ministers declined to  withdraw their confidence from the Lord High Commissioner, though  they passed on him censure for his hasty and independent  proceedings. That the members of Government had a high appreciation  of his great experience, ability, and energy was apparent, for they  declared they had \"no desire to withdraw in the present crisis of  affairs the confidence hitherto reposed in him, the continuance of  which was now more than ever needed to conduct our difficulties in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#13)"],[1," 1831 in Virginia,  originating near the southern border. Four slaves in alliance with three  whites commenced it by killing several families and pressing all the  slaves they could find into their service, until the force was nearly  two hundred. They spread desolation everywhere. Fifty-five white persons  were murdered before the insurrection was in hand. Virginia and North  Carolina called out troops, and at last all the insurgents were captured  or killed. The leader was a black named Nat Turner, who believed himself  called of God to give his people freedom. He had heard voices in the air  and seen signs on the sky, which, with many other portents, he  interpreted as proofs of his divine commission. When all was over Turner  escaped to the woods, dug a hole under some fence-rails and lived there  for six weeks, coming out only at midnight for food. Driven thence by  discovery, he still managed to hide here and there about the plantations  in spite of a whole country of armed men in search of him, until at last  he was accidentally confronted in the bush by a white man with levelled  rifle. He was hanged, November 11th, and sixteen others later. His wife  was tortured for evidence, but in vain. Twelve negroes were transported.  Very many were, without trial, punished in inhuman ways, the heads of  some impaled along the highway as a warning. Partly in consequence of  this horrible affair, originated a stout movement for the abolition of  slavery in Virginia. This was favored by many of the ablest men in the  Old Dominion, but they were overruled.      [Illustration: Turner, holding a short sword and another man pointing a  rifle at him.]  The Discovery of Nat Turner.      Danger from the blacks necessitated the most rigid laws concerning them.  Time had been when it was thought not dangerous to teach slaves to read.  In 1742 Commissary Garden, of the English Society for Propagating the  Gospel, founded a negro school in Charleston, where slaves were taught  by slave teachers, these last being the society's property. Honest Elias  Neale, the society's catechist in New York, engaged in the same work  there, and afterward catechists were so employed in Philadelphia. That  organization did much to stir up the planters to teach their slaves the  rudiments of Christianity. [Footnote: Eggleston in Century, May, 1888.]  Now, all this was changed. The strictest laws were made to keep every  slave in the most abject ignorance, to prevent their congregating, and  to make it impossible for abolitionists or abolitionist literature or  influence to get at them.    [1816]    Inconvenient and perilous as slavery was, southern devotion to it for  many reasons strengthened rather than weakened. The masses did not  perceive the ruin the system was working, which, moreover, consisted  with great profits to vast numbers of influential men and to many  localities. Border States little by little gave up the hope of becoming  free, the old anti-slavery convictions of their best men faltering, and  the practical problem of emancipation, really difficult, being too  easily decided insoluble. More significant, owing to a variety of  circumstances, the abolition spirit itself greatly subsided early in the  present century. Completion of the emancipation process in the North was  assured by the action of New York in 1817, proclaiming a total end to  slavery there from July 4, 1827. The view that each State was absolute  sovereign over slavery within its own borders, responsibility for it and  its abuses there ending with the State's own citizens, was now  universally accepted. Success in securing the act of 1807, making the  slave trade illegal from January 1, 1808, and affixing to it heavy  penalties, lulled multitudes to sleep. This act, however, had effect  only gradually, and its beneficence was greatly lessened in that it left  confiscated negroes to the operation of the local law.    Such quietude was furthered through the formation of the American  Colonization Society in 1816, by easy philanthropists and statesmen,  North as well as South, who swore by the Constitution as admitting no  fundamental amendment, admired its three great compromises, loved all  brethren of the Union except agitators, and deprecated slavery and the  black race about equally; its mission negro deportation, but its actual  efforts confined to the dumping of free blacks, reprobates, and  castaways in some remote corner of the universe, for the convenience of  slave-holders themselves. [Footnote: 3 Schouler's United States, 198.]    [1839]    Meantime much was occurring to harden northern hostility to slavery into  resolute hatred, a fire which might smoulder long but could not die out.  The fugitive slave law for the rendition of runaways found in free  States operated cruelly at best, and was continually abused to kidnap  free blacks. The owner or his attorney or agent could seize a slave  anywhere on the soil of freedom, bring him before the magistrate of the  county, city, or town corporate in which the arrest was made, and prove  his ownership by testimony or by affidavit; and the certificate of such  magistrate that this had been done was a sufficient warrant for the  return of the poor wretch into bondage. Obstruction, rescue, or aid  toward escape was fined in the sum of five hundred dollars. This is the  pith of the fugitive slave act of 1793. It might have been far more  mischievous but for the interpretation put upon it in the celebrated  case of Prigg versus Pennsylvania.    Mr. Prigg was the agent of a Maryland slave-owner. He had in 1839  pursued a slave woman into Pennsylvania, and when refused her surrender  by the local magistrate carried her away by force. He was indicted in  Pennsylvania for kidnapping, an amicable lawsuit made up, and an appeal  taken to the United States Supreme Court. Here, in an opinion prepared  by Justice Story, the Pennsylvania statute under which the magistrate  had acted, providing a mode for the return of fugitives by state  authorities, was declared unconstitutional on the ground that only  Congress could legislate on the subject; but it was added that while a  free State had no right in any way to block the capture of a runaway, as  for example by ordering a jury trial to determine whether a seized  person had really been a slave, so as to protect free persons of dark  complexion, yet States might forbid their officers to aid in the  recovery of slaves. As the act of 1793 did not name any United States  officials for this service it became nearly inoperative. Spite of this  terrible construction of the Constitution, which Chief Justice Taney  thought should have included an assertion of a State's duty by  legislation to aid rendition, many northern States passed personal  liberty laws, besetting the capture of slaves with all possible  difficulties thought compatible with the Constitution. The South  denounced all such laws whatever as unconstitutional, and perhaps some  of them were.    [1835]    Constitutional or not, they were needed. There were regular expeditions  to carry off free colored persons from the coasts of New York and New  Jersey, many of them successful. The foreign slave-trade, with its  ineffable atrocities, proved defiant of law and preternaturally  tenacious of life. A lucrative but barbarous domestic trade had sprung  up between the Atlantic States, Virginia and North Carolina especially,  and those on the Gulf, for the supply of the southern market. Families  were torn apart, gangs of the poor creatures driven thousands of miles  in shackles or carried coastwise in the over-filled holds of vessels, to  live or die--little matter which--under unknown skies and strange,  heartless masters.    The slave codes of the southern States grew severer every year, as did  legislation against free colored people. Laws were passed rendering  emancipation more difficult and less a blessing when obtained. The  Mississippi and Alabama constitutions, 1817 and 1819 respectively, and  all those in the South arising later, were shaped so as to place general  emancipation beyond the power even of Legislatures. Congress was even  thus early--so it seemed at the North--all too subservient to the  slave-holders, partly through the operation of the three-fifths rule,  partly from fear that opposition would bring disunion, partly in that  ambitious legislators were eager for southern votes. As to the Senate,  the South had taken care, Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee having evened  the score, all before 1800, to allow no new northern State to be  admitted unless matched by a southern. In addition to all this, the  North had a vast trade with the South, and northern capitalists held to  an enormous amount mortgages on southern property of all sorts, so that  large and influential classes North had a pecuniary interest in  maintaining at the South both good nature and business prosperity.        CHAPTER II.    \"IMMEDIATE ABOLITION\"    [1832]    While slavery was thus strengthening itself upon its own soil and in  some respects also at the North, its champions ever more alert and  forward, its old foes asleep, these very facts were provoking thought  about the institution and hostility to it, destined in time to work its  overthrow. Interested people saw that slavery, so aggressive and  defiant, must be fought to be put down, and that if the Constitution was  its bulwark, as all believed, provided a tithe of what the South as well  as the North had said of its evils was true, the whole country, and not  the South only, was guilty in tolerating the curse. In 1821 Lundy began  publishing his Genius of Universal Emancipation, seconded, from 1829, by  the more radical Garrison.  In 1831 Garrison founded the Liberator,  whose motto, \"immediate and unconditional emancipation,\" was intended as  a rebuke to the tame policy of the colonizationists. \"I am in earnest,\"  said the plucky man, when his utterances threatened"]]]
