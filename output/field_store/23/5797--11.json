In reality, it had served his purpose to perfection. Its  presence had diverted French levies from Italy, and enabled him,  unmolested, to conquer Navarre. With that he was content. Why should  he wish to see Henry in Guienne? He was too shrewd to involve his own  forces in that hopeless adventure, and the departure of the English  furnished him with an excuse for entering into secret negotiations  with Louis. His methods were eloquent of sixteenth-century         (p. 059)  diplomacy. He was, he ordered Carroz to tell Henry many months  later,[113] when concealment was no longer possible or necessary,  sending a holy friar to his daughter in England; the friar's health  did not permit of his going by sea; so he went through France, and was  taken prisoner. Hearing of his fame for piety, the French Queen desired  his ghostly advice, and took the opportunity of the interview to  persuade the friar to return to Spain with proposals of peace.  Ferdinand was suddenly convinced that death was at hand; his confessor  exhorted him to forgive and make peace with his enemies. This work of  piety he could not in conscience neglect. So he agreed to a twelvemonth's  truce, which secured Navarre. In spite of his conscience he would  never have consented, had he not felt that the truce was really in  Henry's interests. But what weighed with him most was, he said, the  reformation of the Church. That should be Henry's first and noblest  work; he could render no greater service to God. No reformation was  possible without peace, and so long as the Church was unreformed, wars  among princes would never cease.                       [Footnote 112: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 68, 70, 72; _cf._                     _L. and P._, i., 3350, 3356.]                       [Footnote 113: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 89, 118; _L. and                     P._, i., 3839.]    Such reasoning, he thought, would appeal to the pious and unsophisticated  Henry. To other sovereigns he used arguments more suited to their  experience of his diplomacy. He told Maximilian[114] that his main  desire was to serve the Emperor's interests, to put a curb on the  Italians, and to frustrate their design of driving himself, Louis and  Maximilian across the Alps. But the most monumental falsehood he  reserved for the Pope; his ambassador at the Papal Court was to    (p. 060)  assure Julius that he had failed in his efforts to concert with Henry  a joint invasion of France, that Henry was not in earnest over the war  and that he had actually made a truce[115] with France. This had  enabled Louis to pour fresh troops into Italy, and compelled him,  Ferdinand, to consult his own interests and make peace! Two days later  he was complaining to Louis that Henry refused to join in the  truce.[116] To punish Henry for his refusal he was willing to aid  Louis against him, but he would prefer to settle the differences  between the French and the English kings by a still more treacherous  expedient. Julius was to be induced to give a written promise that, if  the points at issue were submitted to his arbitration, he would  pronounce no verdict till it had been secretly sanctioned by Ferdinand  and Louis. This promise obtained, Louis was publicly to appeal to the  Pope; Henry's devotion to the Church would prevent his refusing the  Supreme Pontiff's mediation; if he did, ecclesiastical censures could  be invoked against him.[117] Such was the plot Ferdinand was hatching  for the benefit of his daughter's husband. The Catholic King had ever  deceit in his heart and the name of God on his lips. He was accused by  a rival of having cheated him twice; the charge was repeated to  Ferdinand. \"He lies,\" he broke out, \"I cheated him three times.\" He  was faithful to one principle only, self-aggrandisement by fair means  or foul. His favourite scheme was a kingdom in Northern Italy; but in  the way of its realisation his own overreaching ambition placed an  insuperable bar. Italy had been excluded from his truce with France to  leave him free to pursue that design;[118] but in July, 1512, the  (p. 061)  Italians already suspected his motives, and a papal legate declared  that they no more wished to see Milan Spanish than French.[119] In the  following November, Spanish troops in the pay and alliance of Venice  drove the French out of Brescia. By the terms of the Holy League, it  should have been restored to its owner, the Venetian Republic.  Ferdinand kept it himself; it was to form the nucleus of his North  Italian dominion. Venice at once took alarm and made a compact with  France which kept the Spaniards at bay until after Ferdinand's  death.[120] The friendship between Venice and France severed that  between France and the Emperor; and, in 1513, the war went on with a  rearrangement of partners, Henry and Maximilian on one side,[121]  against France and Venice on the other, with Ferdinand secretly trying  to trick them all.                       [Footnote 114: _Ibid._, ii., 96, 101.]                       [Footnote 115: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 106.]                       [Footnote 116: _Ibid._, ii., 107.]                       [Footnote 117: _Ibid._, ii., 104.]                       [Footnote 118: _Sp.

Bergenroth, in his zeal for Ferdinand,                     represents the Pope and not Ferdinand as being                     responsible for driving Venice into the arms of                     France.]                       [Footnote 121: _L. and P._, i., 3649, 3859-61. The                     league between Henry and Maximilian was concluded                     5th April, 1513; Carroz ratified it on Ferdinand's                     behalf on 25th April, though Ferdinand had already                     signed a truce with France. A good instance of                     Ferdinand's duplicity may be found in _Sp. Cal._,                     ii., 104, 207; in the former he is asking for the                     hand of Renee for his grandson Ferdinand, in the                     latter he tells the Pope that the report that he                     had made this request was pure invention.]           *       *       *       *       *    For many months Henry knew not, or refused to credit, his father-in-law's  perfidy. To outward appearance, the Spanish King was as eager as ever  for the war in Guienne. He was urging Henry to levy 6,000 Germans  (p. 062)  to serve for that purpose in conjunction with Spanish forces; and, in  April, Carroz, in ignorance of his master's real intentions, signed on  his behalf a treaty for the joint invasion of France.[122] This forced  the Catholic King to reveal his hand. He refused his ratification;[123]  now he declared the conquest of Guienne to be a task of such magnitude  that preparations must be complete before April, a date already past;  and he recommended Henry to come into the truce with Louis, the  existence of which he had now to confess. Henry had not yet fathomed  the depths; he even appealed to Ferdinand's feelings and pathetically  besought him, as a good father, not to forsake him entirely.[124] But  in vain; his father-in-law deserted him at his sorest hour of need. To  make peace was out of the question. England's honour had suffered a  stain that must at all costs be removed. No king with an atom of  spirit would let the dawn of his reign be clouded by such an admission  of failure. Wolsey was there to stiffen his temper in case of need;  with him it was almost a matter of life and death to retrieve the  disaster. His credit was pledged in the war. In their moments of anger  under the Spanish sun, the English commanders had loudly imputed to  Wolsey the origin of the war and the cause of all the mischief.[125]  Surrey, for whose banishment from Court the new favourite had  expressed to Fox a wish, and other \"great men\" at home, repeated the  charge.[126] Had Wolsey failed to bring honour with peace, his name  would not have been numbered among the greatest of England's  statesmen.                       [Footnote 122: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 101.]                       [Footnote 123: _Ib._, ii., 118, 122.]                       [Footnote 124: _Ib._, ii., 125.]                       [Footnote 125: _L. and P._, i., 3356, 3451.]                       [Footnote 126: _Ib._, i., 3443.]    Henry's temper required no spur. Tudors never flinched in the face (p. 063)  of danger, and nothing could have made Henry so resolved to go on as  Ferdinand's desertion and advice to desist. He was prepared to avenge  his army in person. There were to be no expeditions to distant shores;  there was to be war in the Channel, where Englishmen were at home on  the sea; and Calais was to be the base of an invasion of France over  soil worn by the tramp of English troops. In March, 1513, Henry, to  whom the navy was a weapon, a plaything, a passion, watched his fleet  sail down the Thames; its further progress was told him in letters  from its gallant admiral, Sir Edmund Howard, who had been strictly  charged to inform the King of the minutest details in the behaviour of  every one of the ships.[127] Never had such a display of naval force  left the English shores; twenty-four ships ranging downwards from the  1,600 tons of the _Henry Imperial_, bore nearly 5,000 marines and  3,000 mariners.[128] The French dared not venture out, while Howard  swept the Channel, and sought them in their ports. Brest was  blockaded. A squadron of Mediterranean galleys coming to its relief  anchored in the shallow water off Conquet. Howard determined to cut  them out; he grappled and boarded their admiral's galley.

It was only a few months after Chopin met George Sand that he was  attacked with a peculiar hacking cough. His friends were sure it was  consumption, and a leading physician gave it as his opinion that if the  patient spent the approaching Winter in Paris, it would be death in  March.    The facts being brought to the notice of George Sand, she had but one  thought--to save the life of this young man. He was too ill to decide  what was best to do, and was never able by temperament to take the  initiative, anyway, so this strong and capable woman, forgetful of self  and her own interests, made all the arrangements and took him to the  Isle of Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea. There she cared for him alone  as she might for a babe, for six long, weary months. They lived in the  cells of an old monastery at Valdemosa, away up on the mountainside  overlooking the sea. Here where the roses bloomed the whole year  through, surrounded by groves of orange-trees, shut in by vines and  flowers, with no society save that of the sacristan and an aged woman  servant, she nursed the death-stricken man back to life and hope.    To better encourage him she sent for and surprised him with his piano,  which had to be carried up the mountain on the backs of mules. In the  quiet cloisters she cared for him with motherly tenderness, and there he  learned again to awake the slumbering echoes with divine music. Several  of his best pieces were composed at Majorca during his convalescence,  where the soft semi-tropical breeze laved his cheek, the birds warbled  him their sweetest carols, and away down below, the sea, mother of all,  sang her ceaseless lullaby. When they returned to France the following  Spring, M. Dudevant had accommodatingly vacated the family residence at  Nohant in favor of his wife. It was here she took the convalescent  Chopin. He was charmed with the rambling old house, its walled-in  gardens with their arbors of clustering grapes, and the green meadows  stretching down to the water's edge, where the little river ran its way  to the ocean.    Back of the house was a great forest of mighty trees, beneath whose  thick shade the sun's rays never entered, and a half-mile away arose the  spire of the village church. There were no neighbors, save a cheery old  priest, and the simple villagers who made respectful obeisance as they  passed. Here it was that Matthew Arnold came to pay his tribute to  genius, also Liszt and the fair Countess d'Agoult, Delacroix, Renan,  Lamennais, Lamartine, and so many others of the great and excellent.  Chopin was enchanted with the place, and refused to go back to Paris.  Madame Dudevant insisted, and explained to him that she took him to  Majorca to spend the Winter, but she had no intention or thought of  caring for him longer than the few months that might be required to  restore him to health. But he cried and clung to her with such  half-childish fright that she had not the heart to send him away.    The summer months passed and the leaves began to turn scarlet and gold,  and he only consented to return to Paris on her agreeing to go with him.  So they returned together, and had rooms not so very far apart.    He went back sturdily to his music-teaching, with an occasional  musicale, yet gave but one public concert in the space of ten years.    The exquisite quality of Chopin's playing appealed only to the sacred  few, but his piano scores were slowly finding sale, through the  advertisement they received by being played by Liszt, Tausig and others.  Yet the critics almost uniformly condemned his work as bizarre and  erratic.    Each Summer he spent at lovely Nohant, and there found the rest and  quiet which got nerves back to the norm and allowed him to go on with  his work. So passed the years away. Of this we are very sure--no taint  exists on the record of Chopin excepting possibly his relationship with  George Sand. That he endeavored to win her full heart's love, for the  purpose of honorable marriage, Mr. Hadow is fully convinced. But when  his suit failed, after an eight years' courtship, and the lover was  discarded, he ceased to work. His heart was broken; he lingered on for  two years, and then death claimed him at the early age of forty years.           *       *       *       *       *    There is a tendency to judge a work of art by its size. Thus the  sculptor who does a \"heroic figure\" is the man who looms large to the  average visitor at the art-gallery.    Chopin wrote no lengthy symphonies, oratorios or operas. His music is  poetry set to exquisite sounds. Poetry is an ecstasy of the spirit, and  ecstasies in their very nature are not sustained moods.    The poetic mood is transient. A composition by Chopin is a soul-ecstasy,  like unto the singing of a lark.    No other man but Chopin should have been allowed to set the songs of  Shelley to music. With such names as Shelley, Keats, Poe and Crane must  Chopin's name be linked.    In Chopin's music there is much loose texture; there are wide-meshed  chords, daring leaps and abrupt arpeggios. These have often been pointed  out as faults, but such harmonious discords are now properly valued, and  we see that Chopin's lapses all had meaning and purpose, in that they  impart a feeling--making their appeal to souls that have suffered--souls  that know.    More of Chopin's music is sold in America every year than was sold  altogether during the lifetime of the composer. His name and fame grow  with each year. Everywhere--wherever a piano is played--on concert  platform, in studio or private parlor, there you will find the work of  Frederic Chopin. That such a widespread distribution must have a potent  and powerful effect upon the race goes without argument, although the  furthest limit of that influence no man can mark. It is registered with  Infinity alone. And thus does that modest, mild and gentle revolutionist  Frederic Chopin live again in minds made better.          [Illustration: SCHUMANN]    ROBERT SCHUMANN           Beneath these flowers I dream, a silent chord. I can not wake my       own strings to music; but under the hands of those who comprehend       me, I become an eloquent friend. Wanderer, ere thou goest, try me!       The more trouble thou takest with me, the more lovely will be the       tones with which I shall reward thee.         --_Robert Schumann_      ROBERT SCHUMANN    That any man should ever write his thoughts for other men to read, seems  the very height of egoism.    Literature never dies, and so the person who writes constitutes himself  a rival of Shakespeare and seeks to lure us from Montaigne, Milton,  Emerson and Carlyle. To write nothing better than grammatical English,  to punctuate properly, and repeat thoughts in the same sequence that  have been repeated a thousand times, is to do something icily regular,  splendidly null.    To down the demons of syntax and epithet is not enough. To compose  blameless sonatas and produce symphonies in the accepted style, is not  adding an iota to the world's worth.    The individual who tries to compose either ideas or harmonious sounds,  and hopes for success, must compose because he can not help it. He must  place the thing in a way it has never before been placed; on the subject  he must throw a new light; he must carry the standard forward, and plant  it one degree nearer the uncaptured citadel of the Ideal. And he must  remember this: the very prominence of his position will cause him to be  the target of contumely, abuse and much stupid misunderstanding. If he  complains of these things (as he probably will), he reveals a rift in  the lute and proves that he is only a half-god, after all.    Men of the highest type of culture--those of masterly talent--are not  gregarious in their nature. The \"jiner\" instinct goes with a man who is  a little doubtful, and so he attaches himself to this society, club or  church.    The very tendency to \"jine\" is an admission of weakness--it is a getting  under cover, a combining against the supposed enemy. The \"jiner\" is an  ameba that clings to flotsam, instead of floating free in the great  ocean of life. The lion loves his mate, but prefers to flock by himself.    The pioneer in art, as in any other field, must be willing to face  deprivations and loneliness and heart-hunger. He must find companionship  with birds and animals, and be brother to the trees and swift-flying  clouds. When men meet on the desert or in the forest wilds, how grateful  and how gracious is their hand-clasp! When love and understanding come  to those who live on the border-land of two worlds, how precious and  priceless the boon!           *       *       *       *       *    Robert Schumann was the son of a book-publisher of Zwickau. He was a  handsome lad with the flash of genius in his luminous eyes, and an  independence like that of an Alpine goat. When very young they say he  used to have tantrums. If your child has a tantrum, it is bad policy for  you to imitate him and have one, too.    A tantrum is only one of the little whirlwinds of God--it is misdirected  energy, power not yet controlled. When Robert had a tantrum, his father  would shake him violently to improve his temper, or fall upon him with a  strap that hung handy behind the kitchen-door. Then the mother, when the  father was out of the way, would take the lad and cry over him, and  coddle him, and undo the discipline.    The best treatment for tantrums is--nothing. The more you let a nervous,  impressionable child alone, the better.    When the lad was fourteen years old, we find him setting type in his  father's printery. He was working on a book called, \"The World's  Celebrities,\" and his share of the work dealt with Jean Paul Richter. He  grew interested in the copy and stopped setting type and read ahead, as  printers sometimes will. The more he read, the more he was fascinated.  He fell under the spell of Jean Paul "]]]
