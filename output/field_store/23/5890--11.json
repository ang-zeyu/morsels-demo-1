[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#13)"],[1," He now had his wooden  rails and his pygmy engine but was confronted by still another  perplexity. The railroad must pass a very abrupt curve, it was  unavoidable that it should do so--a curve so dangerous that everybody  who saw it predicted that to round it without the engine jumping the  track and derailing the cars behind would be impossible. Poor Peter  Cooper faced a very discouraging problem. There was no gainsaying that  the curve was a bad one; moreover, his locomotive was not so perfect a  product as he might have wished. It had been built under his direction  and consisted of the wee engine he had bought in New York connected with  an iron boiler about the size of an ordinary tin wash boiler; and as no  iron piping was made in America at this time Cooper had taken some old  steel musket barrels as a substitute for tubing. With this crude affair  he was determined to convince the public that a steam railroad was a  workable proposition.\"    \"He had a nerve!\"    \"It took nerve to live and accomplish anything in those days,\" returned  Mr. Tolman. \"In the first place few persons had fortunes large enough to  back big undertakings; and in addition America was still such a young  country that it had not begun to produce the materials needed by  inventors for furthering any very extensive projects. In fact the world  of progress was, as Kipling says, 'very new and all.' Hence human  ingenuity had to make what was at hand answer the required purpose, and  as a result Peter Cooper's Tom Thumb engine, with its small iron boiler  and its gun-barrel tubing, was set upon the wooden track, and an open  car (a sort of box on wheels with seats in it) was fastened to it. Into  this primitive conveyance the guests invited for the occasion clambered.  Ahead lay the forbidding curve. Stephenson, the English engineer, had  already stated mathematically the extreme figure at which a curve could  be taken and the locomotive still remain on the track, and Peter Cooper  was well aware that the curve he must make was a far worse one. However,  it would never do for him to betray that he had any misgivings.  Therefore, together with his guests, he set out on his eventful trip  which was either to demolish them all, or convince the dignitaries of  the railroad company that not only was a steam railroad practical but  that the Baltimore and Ohio Road was a property valuable enough to be  backed by capital.\"    Steve leaned forward, listening eagerly to the story.    \"Slowly the little engine started, and nearer and nearer came the  terrible curve. The train was now running at fifteen miles an hour, a  speed almost unbelievable to the simple souls of that time. Round the  curve it went in safety, increasing its velocity to eighteen miles an  hour. The railroad officials who were Cooper's guests were frantic with  enthusiasm. One man produced paper and pencil and begged those present  to write their names, just to prove that it was possible to write even  when flying along at such a meteoric rate of speed. Another man jotted  down a few sentences to demonstrate that to think and write connected  phrases were things that could be done, in spite of the fact that one  was dashing through space with this unearthly rapidity.\"    \"So the railroad men were converted, were they?\"    \"They were more than converted; they were exultant,\" said his father.  \"Of course it was some time after this before the Baltimore and Ohio  Railroad became a reality. Capital had to be raised and the project  stably launched.\"    \"Oh, then this was not the first railroad in the country, after all,\"  observed the boy in a disappointed tone.    \"No. South Carolina boasts the first regular passenger locomotive  propelled by steam,\" returned Mr. Tolman. \"This road ran from Charleston  to Hamburg and although a charter was obtained for it in 1827 it took  all the first year to lay six miles of track. In fact it was not until  1830 that the railroad began to be operated to any extent. When it was,  a locomotive, every part of which had been produced in this country, was  employed to draw the trains. This was the first steam locomotive of  American make in history. It was dubbed 'The Best Friend' and, like the  engines that had preceded it, had a series of interesting adventures.  Since it was the only locomotive in the possession of the road and was  in use all day any repairs on the hard-worked object had to be made at  night.\"    \"Humph!\" ejaculated Stephen.    \"Nevertheless 'The Best Friend' might have gone on its way prosperously  had it not been for the ignorance of those who ran it. The engineer, to  be sure, understood more or less about a steam locomotive although he  was none too wise; but the fireman, unfortunately, understood next to  nothing, and one day, on being left alone in the cab and seeing the  steam escaping from the safety valve, he conceived the notion that a  leak was causing unnecessary waste. Therefore he securely screwed up the  space through which the steam had been issuing, and to make prevention  more certain he himself, a large and heavy man, sat down on the escape  valve.\"    \"And presto!\" exclaimed Steve, rubbing his hands.    \"Exactly so! Presto, indeed! Figuratively speaking, he blew sky-high and  'The Best Friend' with him,\" replied Mr. Tolman. \"It was an unfortunate  happening, too, for people were still ill-informed about the uses of  steam and very nervous about its mysterious power and this accident only  served to make them more so. For some time afterward many persons  refused to patronize the railroad in spite of all the authorities could  do to soothe them. In time, however, the public calmed down, although in  order to reassure them it was found necessary to put a car heaped with  bales of cotton between them and the engine, not only to conceal the  monster from their view but also to convince them that it was some  distance away. Whether they also had a vague notion that in case they  went skyward the cotton might soften their fall when they came down, I  do not know.\"    \"Railroading certainly had its troubles, didn't it?\" Steve commented  with amusement.    \"It certainly had, especially in our own country,\" was the reply. \"In  England Stephenson and other experimenters like him had materials at  hand which to some extent served their purpose; moreover, thanks to Watt  and other inventors, there were definite scientific ideas to work from.  But in America the successful railroad which might serve as a model was  unknown. Therefore for some time English engines continued to be shipped  across the sea, and even then it was a long time before our American  engineers understood much about their mechanism. Only by means of  repeated experiments, first in one part of the country and then in  another, did our American railroads, so marvelous in their construction,  come into being.\"    Mr. Tolman paused a moment, yawned, and then rose and beckoned to the  porter.    \"We still have much to perfect in our modern railroad, however,\" he said  with a touch of humor. \"The sleeping car, for example, is an  abomination, as you are speedily to have proved to you. Here, porter!  We'd like these berths made up. I guess we'd better turn in now, son.  You have had enough railroading for one day and are tired. You must get  a rest and be in the pink of condition to-morrow for, remember, you are  going to wake up in New York.\"    \"If it will make to-morrow come any quicker I am quite ready to go to  bed,\" retorted Stephen, with a sleepy smile.          CHAPTER VII    A HOLIDAY JOURNEY      The next morning, when Steve woke to the swaying of the train and a  drowsy sense of confusion and smoke, he could not for an instant think  where he was; but it did not take long for him to open his eyes,  recollect the happenings of the previous day, smile with satisfaction,  and hurriedly wriggle into his clothes.    Already he could hear his father stirring in the berth below and  presently the elder man called:    \"We shall be in New York in half-an-hour, son, so get your traps packed  up. How did you sleep?\"    \"Sound as a top!\"    \"That is fine! I was afraid you might not rest very well. As I observed  last night, a sleeping car is not all that it might be. The day will  come when it will have to be improved. However, since it gets us to New  York safely and economizes hours of day travel, it is a blessing for  which we should be grateful.\"    As he spoke he moved into the aisle and helped the boy down from his  perch; they then sought out a distant seat where they dropped down and  watched the rapidly passing landscape.    \"I have been thinking, as I was dressing, of the story you told me last  night about our American railroads,\" said the lad. \"It surprised me a  good deal to hear that the South took the lead over the North in the  introduction of the steam locomotive.\"    Mr. Tolman smiled into the eager face.    \"While it is true that South Carolina took the initiative in railroading  for a short time the South did not remain long in the ascendency,\" he  answered, \"for the third steam locomotive put into actual passenger  service was built at Albany. This city, because of its geographical  position, was a great stagecoach center, having lines that radiated from  it into the interior in almost every direction. And not only was it an  important coaching rendezvous but as it was also a leading commercial  tributary of New York the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad had built a short  track between Albany and Schenectady and supplied it with cars propelled  by horse power. Now in 1831 the company decided to transform this road  into a steam railroad and to this end ordered a steam locomotive called  the 'DeWitt Clinton' to be constructed at West Point with the aim of  demonstrating to the northern States the advantages of steam  transportation. You can imagine the excitement this announcement caused.

Wait patiently a little longer. You have but three days  more, and your term will be completed. You know it is for your own good,  and I encourage you to persevere. Shall not your aged father live to see  you a star among the chieftains and the beloved of battle?\"    The son assented; and covering himself more closely, that he might shut  out the light which prompted him to complain, he lay till the eleventh  day, when he repeated his request.    The father addressed Iadilla as he had the day before, and promised that  he would himself prepare his first meal, and bring it to him by the dawn  of the morning.    The son moaned, and the father added:    \"Will you bring shame upon your father when his sun is falling in the  west?\"    \"I will not shame you, my father,\" replied Iadilla; and he lay so still  and motionless that you could only know that he was living by the gentle  heaving of his breast.    At the spring of day, the next morning, the father, delighted at having  gained his end, prepared a repast for his son, and hastened to set it  before him. On coming to the door of the little lodge, he was surprised  to hear his son talking to himself. He stooped his ear to listen, and,  looking through a small opening, he was yet more astonished when he  beheld his son painted with vermilion over all his breast, and in the  act of finishing his work by laying on the paint as far back on his  shoulders as he could reach with his hands, saying at the same time, to  himself:    \"My father has destroyed my fortune as a man. He would not listen to my  requests. He has urged me beyond my tender strength. He will be the  loser. I shall be forever happy in my new state, for I have been  obedient to my parent. He alone will be the sufferer, for my guardian  spirit is a just one. Though not propitious to me in the manner I  desired, he has shown me pity in another way--he has given me another  shape; and now I must go.\"    At this moment the old man broke in, exclaiming:    \"My son! my son! I pray you leave me not!\"    But the young man, with the quickness of a bird, had flown to the top of  the lodge and perched himself on the highest pole, having been changed  into a beautiful robin red-breast. He looked down upon his father with  pity beaming in his eyes, and addressed him as follows:    \"Regret not, my father, the change you behold. I shall be happier in my  present state than I could have been as a man. I shall always be the  friend of men, and keep near their dwellings. I shall ever be happy and  contented; and although I could not gratify your wishes as a warrior, it  will be my daily aim to make you amends for it as a harbinger of peace  and joy. I will cheer you by my songs, and strive to inspire in others  the joy and lightsomeness of heart I feel in my present state. This will  be some compensation to you for the loss of glory you expected. I am now  free from the cares and pains of human life. My food is spontaneously  furnished by the mountains and fields, and my pathway of life is in the  bright air.\"    Then stretching himself on his toes, as if delighted with the gift of  wings, Iadilla caroled one of his sweetest songs, and flew away into a  neighboring wood.          X.    WHITE FEATHER AND THE SIX GIANTS.      There was an old man living in the depth of a forest, with his grandson,  whom he had taken in charge when quite an infant. The child had no  parents, brothers, or sisters; they had all been destroyed by six large  giants, and he had been informed that he had no other relative living  beside his grandfather. The band to whom he had belonged had put up  their children on a wager in a race against those of the giants, and had  thus lost them. There was an old tradition in the tribe, that, one day,  it would produce a great man, who would wear a white feather, and who  would astonish every one by his feats of skill and bravery.    The grandfather, as soon as the child could play about, gave him a bow  and arrows to amuse himself with. He went into the edge of the woods one  day, and saw a rabbit; but not knowing what it was, he ran home and  described it to his grandfather. He told him what it was, that its flesh  was good to eat, and that if he would shoot one of his arrows into its  body he would kill it. The boy went out again and brought home the  little animal, which he asked his grandfather to boil, that they might  feast on it. He humored the boy in this, and he encouraged him to go on  in acquiring the knowledge of hunting, until he could kill deer and the  larger kinds of game; and he became, as he grew up, an expert hunter.    As they lived alone, and away from other Indians, the curiosity of the  stripling was excited to know what was passing in the world. One day he  came to the edge of a prairie, where he saw ashes like those at his  grandfather's lodge, and lodge-poles left standing.    He returned, and inquired whether his grandfather had put up the poles  and made the fire. He was answered, No. Nor did he believe that he had  seen any thing of the kind. He must have lost his senses to be talking  of such things.    Another day the young man went out to see what there was, within a day's  hunt, that was curious; and on entering the woods he heard a voice  calling out to him, \"Come here, you destined wearer of the White  Feather. You do not wear it, yet, but you are worthy of it. Return home  and take a short nap. You will dream of hearing a voice, which will tell  you to rise and smoke. You will see in your dream a pipe, a  smoking-sack, and a large white feather. When you awake you will find  these articles. Put the feather on your head, and you will become a  great hunter, a great warrior, and a great man, able to do any thing. As  a proof that these things shall come to pass, when you smoke, the smoke  will turn into pigeons.\"    The voice then informed the young man who he was, and made known the  character of his grandfather, who was imposing upon him to serve his own  ends.    The voice-spirit then caused a vine to be laid at his side, and told him  that he was now of an age to avenge the wrongs of his kindred. \"When you  meet your enemy,\" the spirit added, \"you will run a race with him. He  will not see the vine, because it is enchanted. While you are running,  you will throw it over his head and entangle him, so that you will win  the race.\"    Long before this speech was ended the young man had turned to the  quarter from which the voice proceeded, and he was astonished to behold  a man; for as yet he had never seen any human being beside his  grandfather.    As he looked more keenly, he saw that this man, who had the looks of  great age, was wood from the breast downward, and that he appeared to be  fixed in the earth. As his eye dwelt upon this strange being, the  countenance by degrees faded away, and when he advanced to the spot  whence it had addressed him, it was gone.    He returned home; slept; in the midst of his slumbers, as from the  hollow of the air, heard the voice; wakened and found the promised  gifts. His grandfather, when his attention was called to his awakening,  was greatly surprised to find the youth with a white feather on his  forehead, and to see flocks of pigeons flying out of his lodge. He then  remembered the old tradition, and knowing that now the day when he  should lose control of his charge had begun, he bitterly bewailed the  hour.    Possessed of his three magic gifts, the young man departed the next  morning, to seek his enemies, and to demand revenge.    The six giants lived in a very high lodge in the middle of a wood. He  traveled on, in good heart, till he reached this lodge, where he found  that his coming had been made known by the little spirits who carry the  news. The giants hastened out, and gave a cry of joy as they saw him  drawing near. When he approached within hail, they began to make sport  of him, saying, \"Here comes the little man with the white feather, who  is to achieve such wonderful wonders.\"    When, however, he had arrived among them, they spoke him fair, saying he  was a brave man and would do brave things. Their object was to encourage  him, so that he would be bold to engage in some fool-hardy trial of  strength.    Without paying much heed to their fine speeches, White Feather went  fearlessly into their lodge; and without waiting for invitation, he  challenged them to a foot-match. They agreed; and, as they said, by way  of being easy with him, they told him to begin the race with the  smallest of their number.    The point to which they were to run was a peeled tree toward the rising  sun, and then back to the starting-place, which was a war-club of iron.  Whoever won this stake, was empowered to use it in dispatching the  defeated champion. If White Feather should overcome the first giant, he  was to try the second, and so on, until they had all measured speed with  him. By a dexterous use of the vine, he gained the first race, struck  down his competitor, and cut off his head.    The next morning he ran with the second giant, whom he also outran,  killed and beheaded.    He went on in this way for the five mornings, always conquering by the  aid of his vine, and lopping off the heads of the vanquished giants.    The last of the giants who was yet to run with him acknowledged his  power, but prepared secretly to deceive him. By way of parley, he  proposed that White Feather should leave the heads with him, and that he  would give him a handsome start for odds. This White Feather declined,  as he preferred to keep the heads as trophies of his victory.    Before going to the giant's lodge, on the sixth morning, he met his old  counselor in the woods, standing rooted in the earth, as before. He told  White Feather that he was about to be deceived; that he had never known  any other sex but his own, but that as he went on his way to the lodge  he would meet the most"]]]
