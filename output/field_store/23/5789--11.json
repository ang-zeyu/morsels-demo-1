But to the last the difficulties of the      language were a main obstacle, not only to himself, but to every      other foreigner who served with, or under, the United States. Thus      there are still preserved some of the ill-spelled and scarcely      intelligible notes of Count Pulasky, during the short time that he      served as general of cavalry. Still worse was the case of Baron      Steuben, a veteran of the school of Frederick the Second, who      joined the Americans a few months later than La Fayette, and who      greatly aided them in the establishment of discipline. The Baron,      it appears, could not teach and drill, nor even swear and curse,      but by means of an interpreter! He was, therefore, most fortunate      in securing as his aid-de-camp Captain Walker of New-York--most      fortunate, if, as his American biographer assures us, \"there was      not, perhaps, another officer in the army, unless Hamilton be      excepted, who could speak French and English so as to be well      understood in both.\"        La Fayette did not always confine himself to the bounds of his own      profession; sometimes, and, perhaps, not greatly to his credit, he      stepped beyond them. Here is one case recorded with much      satisfaction by himself. He states, that soon after his arrival in      America, and while attending on Sunday the service of the Church      of England, he was displeased with the clergyman, because in his      sermon he had said nothing at all of politics. \"I charged him to      his face,\" says La Fayette, \"with preaching only about Heaven!...      But next Sunday,\" continues the keen young officer, \"I heard him      again, when his loud invectives against 'the execrable House of      Hanover,' showed that he was ready and willing to take my good      advice.\"                                  JOHN HORNE TOOKE.        His abilities were ill fitted for the profession of a clergyman,      which indeed he at last renounced, but they highly qualified him      for his favorite occupation as a demagogue. Between him and Wilkes      there now arose a violent animosity and a keen altercation carried      on in newspapers. Descending to the lowest and most selfish      details, they were not ashamed thus publicly to wrangle respecting      a Welsh pony and a hamper of claret! Even before the close of 1770      might be discerned the growing discord and weakness of Wilkes and      his city friends. At a meeting which they convened to consider      their course of action, some proposed a new Remonstrance to the      King, while others urged an impeachment of Lord North in the House      of Commons. \"What is the use of a new Remonstrance?\" cried Wilkes.      \"It would only serve to make another paper kite for His Royal      Highness the Prince of Wales!\"--\"What is the use of an      impeachment?\" cried Sawbridge. \"Lord North is quite sure of the      Bishops and the Scotch Peers in the Upper House, and could not      fail to be acquitted!\" But although these ardent patriots might      differ a little as to the means, they were bent on one and the      same end; and the Remonstrance which was at last agreed upon,      appears to have been framed by their united wisdom. As thus drawn      up it teemed with silly vagaries fit only to please the lowest      order of intellects. Thus it prayed that His Majesty would for      ever remove from his presence and councils all his Ministers and      Secretaries of State, especially Lord Mansfield (who by the way      was not one of them), and that His Majesty would not again admit      any Scotchman into the administration!                               THE CHARACTER OF WILKES.        He was born in 1727, the son of a rich distiller. Early in life he      set up a brewery for himself, but soon relinquished the wearisome      business. Early in life also he improved his fortune by his      marriage with the daughter and heiress of the celebrated Dr. Mead,      the author of the \"Treatise on Poisons.\" But this lady, being of      maturer age than himself, and of slight personal attractions, was      speedily slighted, and he left her with as much disgust as he had      his brewery. In 1757 he was elected Member of Parliament for      Aylesbury, but never obtained any success as an orator, his      speeches being, though flippant, yet feeble. In truth he had no      great ability of any kind, but dauntless courage and high animal      spirits. Nor should we deny him another much rarer praise,--a vein      of good humor and kindliness, which did not forsake him through      all his long career, amidst the riot of debauchery or the rancor      of faction. So agreeable and insinuating was his conversation,      that more than one fair dame as she listened found herself forget      his sinister squint and his ill-favored countenance. He used to      say of himself in a laughing strain, that though he was the      ugliest man in England, he wanted nothing to make him even with      the handsomest but half an hour at starting! Politics indeed      seemed at first wholly alien from Wilkes's sphere; gayety and      gallantry were his peculiar objects. For some time he reigned the      oracle of green-rooms and the delight of taverns. In conjunction      with other kindred spirits, as Paul Whitehead and Sir Francis      Dashwood, amounting in all to twelve, he rented Medmenham Abbey,      near Marlow. It is a secluded and beautiful spot on the banks of      the Thames, with hanging woods that slope down to the crystal      stream, a grove of venerable elms, and meadows of the softest      green. In days of old it had been a convent of Cistercian monks,      but the new brotherhood took the title of Franciscans in      compliment to Sir Francis Dashwood, whom they called their Father      Abbot. On the portal, now again in ruins, and once more resigned      to its former solitude and silence, I could still a few years      since read the inscription placed there by Wilkes and his friends:      fay ce que voudras. Other French and Latin inscriptions, now with      good reason effaced, then appeared in other parts of the grounds,      some of them remarkable for wit, but all for either profaneness or      obscenity, and many the more highly applauded as combining both.      In this retreat the new Franciscans used often to meet for summer      pastimes, and varied the round of their debauchery by a mock      celebration of the principal Roman Catholic rites.                               WILKES'S ESSAY ON WOMAN.        It appears that Wilkes had, several years before, and in some of      his looser hours, composed a parody of Pope's \"Essay on Man.\" In      this undertaking, which, according to his own account, cost him a      great deal of pains and time, he was, it is said, assisted by      Thomas Potter, second son of the late Archbishop of Canterbury,      who had been Secretary of Frederick Prince of Wales, and had since      shown ability and gained office in the House of Commons, but was      (as well became one of Wilkes's friends) of lax morals in his      private life. The result of their joint authorship, however, has      little wit or talent to make any amends for the blasphemy and      lewdness with which it abounds. As the original had been inscribed      by Pope to Lord Bolingbroke, so was the parody by Wilkes to Lord      Sandwich; thus it began, \"Awake my Sandwich!\" instead of \"Awake my      St. John!\" Thus also, in ridicule of Warburton's well-known      commentary, some burlesque notes were appended in the name of the      Right Reverend the Bishop of Gloucester.        This worthless poem had remained in manuscript, and lain in      Wilkes's desk, until in the previous spring he had occasion to set      up a press at his own house, and was tempted to print fourteen      copies only as presents to his boon companions. Of one of these      copies the Government obtained possession, through a subordinate      agent, and by not very creditable means, and Lord Sandwich holding      it forth in his hand with the air of injured innocence, denounced      it as not only scandalous and impious, but also as a breach of      Privilege against the Bishop as a Peer of Parliament. He likewise      complained of another profane parody, written by the same hand,      and printed on the same occasion; this last was entitled, \"The      VENI CREATOR paraphrased.\" The most offensive passages of both      were now by Lord Sandwich's order read aloud to the House, until      Lord Lyttleton with a groan entreated that they might hear no      more!        In the discussion which ensured, Bishop Warburton, forgetting that      such ribaldries could not really tarnish his character, showed a      heat which little became it. He exclaimed that the blackest fiends      in Hell would disdain to keep company with Wilkes,--and then asked      pardon of Satan for comparing them together! Both the Earl and      Bishop in their passion would have readily over-leaped the common      forms of justice. The former, after producing evidence at the Bar      as to the authorship of Wilkes, wished the House to take measures      for his prosecution, without the least delay. But the Peers,      although readily agreeing to vote the two parodies blasphemous and      breaches of Privilege, resolved, on the motion of Lord Mansfield,      to adjourn all further questions until the day after the next, so      as to give Wilkes the opportunity, if he desired it, of alleging      any matter in denial or defence.                                    LORD THURLOW.        With all his faults and shortcomings there was that in Thurlow      which overawed and daunted his contemporaries, and of which the      impression is not wholly lost even on posterity. It was a saying      of Mr. Fox, that no man ever yet was so wise as Thurlow looked.

They thought that this in some way killed  the wicked magician who had killed their friend. For example, it  happened that in a squabble between two men about a horse a third man  who tried to make peace between the disputants was mortally wounded by  their spears and died in a few days. To us it might seem obvious that  the peacemaker was killed by the spear-wounds which he had received, but  none of the Abipones would admit such a thing for a moment. They stoutly  affirmed that their comrade had been done to death by the magical arts  of some person unknown, and their suspicions fell on a certain old  woman, known to be a witch, to whom the deceased had lately refused to  give a water-melon, and who out of spite had killed him by her spells,  though he appeared to the European eye to have died of a spear-wound.[7]    [Sidenote: Belief of the Araucanians.]    Similarly the warlike Araucanians of Chili are said to disbelieve in  natural death. Even if a man dies peaceably at the age of a hundred,  they still think that he has been bewitched by an enemy. A diviner or  medicine-man is consulted in order to discover the culprit. Some of  these wizards enjoy a great reputation and the Indians will send a  hundred miles or more to get the opinion of an eminent member of the  profession. In such cases they submit to him some of the remains of the  dead man, for example, his eyebrows, his nails, his tongue, or the soles  of his feet, and from an examination of these relics the man of skill  pronounces on the author of the death. The person whom he accuses is  hunted down and killed, sometimes by fire, amid the yells of an enraged  crowd.[8]    [Sidenote: Belief of the Bakairi.]    When the eminent German anthropologist was questioning a Bakairi Indian  of Brazil as to the language of his tribe, he gave the sentence, \"Every  man must die\" to be translated into the Bakairi language. To his  astonishment, the Indian remained long silent. The same long pause  always occurred when an abstract proposition, with which he was  unfamiliar, was put before the Indian for translation into his native  tongue. On the present occasion the enquirer learned that the Indian has  no idea of necessity in the abstract, and in particular he has no  conception at all of the necessity of death. The cause of death, in his  opinion, is invariably an ill turn done by somebody to the deceased. If  there were only good men in the world, he thinks that there would be  neither sickness nor death. He knows nothing about a natural end of the  vital process; he believes that all sickness and disease are the effects  of witchcraft.[9]    [Sidenote: Belief of the Indians of Guiana in sorcery as the cause of  sickness and death.]    Speaking of the Indians of Guiana, an English missionary, who knew them  well, says that the worst feature in their character is their proneness  to blood revenge, \"by which a succession of retaliatory murders may be  kept up for a long time. It is closely connected with their system of  sorcery, which we shall presently consider. A person dies,--and it is  supposed that an enemy has secured the agency of an evil spirit to  compass his death. Some sorcerer, employed by the friends of the  deceased for that purpose, pretends by his incantations to discover the  guilty individual or family, or at any rate to indicate the quarter  where they dwell. A near relative of the deceased is then charged with  the work of vengeance. He becomes a _kanaima_, or is supposed to be  possessed by the destroying spirit so called, and has to live apart,  according to strict rule, and submit to many privations, until the deed  of blood be accomplished. If the supposed offender cannot be slain, some  innocent member of his family--man, woman, or little child--must suffer  instead.\"[10] The same writer tells us that these Indians of Guiana  attribute sickness and death directly to the agency of certain evil  spirits called _yauhahu_, who delight in inflicting miseries upon  mankind. Pain, in the language of the Arawaks (one of the best-known  tribes of Guiana), is called _yauhahu simaira_ or \"the evil spirit's  arrow.\"[11] It is these evil spirits whom wicked sorcerers employ to  accomplish their fell purpose. Thus while the demon is the direct cause  of sickness and death, the sorcerer who uses him as his tool is the  indirect cause. The demon is thought to do his work by inserting some  alien substance into the body of the sufferer, and a medicine-man is  employed to extract it by chanting an invocation to the maleficent  spirit, shaking his rattle, and sucking the part of the patient's frame  in which the cause of the malady is imagined to reside. \"After many  ceremonies he will produce from his mouth some strange substance, such  as a thorn or gravel-stone, a fish-bone or bird's claw, a snake's tooth,  or a piece of wire, which some malicious _yauhahu_ is supposed to have  inserted in the affected part. As soon as the patient fancies himself  rid of this cause of his illness his recovery is generally rapid, and  the fame of the sorcerer greatly increased. Should death, however,  ensue, the blame is laid upon the evil spirit whose power and malignity  have prevailed over the counteracting charms. Some rival sorcerer will  at times come in for a share of the blame, whom the sufferer has  unhappily made his enemy, and who is supposed to have employed the  _yauhahu_ in destroying him. The sorcerers being supposed to have the  power of causing, as well as of curing diseases, are much dreaded by the  common people, who never wilfully offend them. So deeply rooted in the  Indian's bosom is this belief concerning the origin of diseases, that  they have little idea of sickness arising from other causes. Death may  arise from a wound or a contusion, or be brought on by want of food, but  in other cases it is the work of the _yauhahu_\"[12] or evil spirit.    [Sidenote: Some deaths attributed to sorcery and others to evil spirits:  practical consequence of this distinction.]    In this account it is to be observed that while all natural deaths from  sickness and disease are attributed to the direct action of evil  spirits, only some of them are attributed to the indirect action of  sorcerers. The practical consequences of this theoretical distinction  are very important. For whereas death by sorcery must, in the opinion of  savages, be avenged by killing the supposed sorcerer, death by the  action of a demon cannot be so avenged; for how are you to get at the  demon? Hence, while every death by sorcery involves, theoretically at  least, another death by violence, death by a demon involves no such  practical consequence. So far, therefore, the faith in sorcery is far  more murderous than the faith in demons. This practical distinction is  clearly recognised by these Indians of Guiana; for another writer, who  laboured among them as a missionary, tells us that when a person dies a  natural death, the medicine-man is called upon to decide whether he  perished through the agency of a demon or the agency of a sorcerer. If  he decides that the deceased died through the malice of an evil spirit,  the body is quietly buried, and no more is thought of the matter. But if  the wizard declares that the cause of death was sorcery, the corpse is  closely inspected, and if a blue mark is discovered, it is pointed out  as the spot where the invisible poisoned arrow, discharged by the  sorcerer, entered the man. The next thing is to detect the culprit. For  this purpose a pot containing a decoction of leaves is set to boil on a  fire. When it begins to boil over, the side on which the scum first  falls is the quarter in which the supposed murderer is to be sought. A  consultation is then held: the guilt is laid on some individual, and one  of the nearest relations of the deceased is charged with the duty of  finding and killing him. If the imaginary culprit cannot be found, any  other member of his family may be slain in his stead. \"It is not  difficult to conceive,\" adds the writer, \"how, under such circumstances,  no man's life is secure; whilst these by no means unfrequent murders  must greatly tend to diminish the number of the natives.\"[13]    [Sidenote: Among the Indians of Guiana death is oftener attributed to  sorcery than to demons.]    However, it would seem that among the Indians of Guiana sickness and  death are oftener ascribed to the agency of sorcerers than to the agency  of demons acting alone. For another high authority on these Indians, Sir  Everard F. im Thurn, tells us that \"every death, every illness, is  regarded not as the result of natural law, but as the work of a  _kenaima_\" or sorcerer. \"Often indeed,\" he adds, \"the survivors or the  relatives of the invalid do not know to whom to attribute the deed,  which therefore perforce remains unpunished; but often, again, there is  real or fancied reason to fix on some one as the _kenaima_, and then the  nearest relative of the injured individual devotes himself to retaliate.  Strange ceremonies are sometimes observed in order to discover the  secret _kenaima_. Richard Schomburgk describes a striking instance of  this. A Macusi boy had died a natural death, and his relatives  endeavoured to discover the quarter to which the _kenaima_ who was  supposed to have slain him belonged. Raising a terrible and monotonous  dirge, they carried the body to an open piece of ground, and there  formed a circle round it, while the father, cutting from the corpse both  the thumbs and little fingers, both the great and the little toes, and a  piece of each heel, threw these pieces into a new pot, which had been  filled with water. A fire was kindled, and on this the pot was placed.  When the water began to boil, according to the side on which one of the  pieces was first thrown out from the pot by the bubbling of the water,  in that direction would the _kenaima_ be.
