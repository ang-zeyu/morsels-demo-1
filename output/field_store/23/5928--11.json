Westward of his monument stands that  of Archbishop Stratford (1333-1348), who was Grand Justiciary to Edward  III. during his absence in Flanders, and won fame by his struggle with the  king. Between this tomb and the archbishop's throne lies Cardinal Kemp  (1452-1454), who was present at Agincourt in the camp of Henry V.; his  tomb is surmounted by a remarkable wooden canopy. Opposite, on the north  side, is the very interesting monument of Archbishop Henry Chichele  (1414-1443). Shakespeare tells us that he was the instigator of Henry V.'s  war with France, and it is supposed that out of remorse for this act he  built, during his lifetime, the curious tomb which now conceals his bones;  it is kept in repair by All Souls' College, which was founded by the  penitent archbishop that its fellows might pray for the souls of all who  had perished during the war; the effigy, in full canonicals, with its head  supported by angels, and with two monks holding open books, kneeling at  its feet, lies on the upper slab; and underneath is a ghastly figure in a  winding-sheet, supposed to represent the archbishop after death; the  diminutive figures which originally filled the niches were destroyed by  the Puritans, but have been to some extent replaced. The gaudy colours of  the tomb enable one to form some idea of the appearance of the churches in  the Middle Ages, when they were bedizened with painted images, hangings,  and frescoes: to judge from this specimen the effect must have been  distinctly tawdry. Further east we find the monument of Archbishop Howley;  he was chiefly remarkable as having crowned Queen Victoria and married her  to the Prince Consort, and his monument is noticeable as being the first  erected to an archbishop, in the cathedral, since the Reformation; he  himself lies at Addington. Beyond is a fine tomb well worthy of  examination, crowned by an elaborate canopy which shows traces of rough  usage at the hands of the restoring enthusiasts, who surrounded the choir  with classical wainscoting after the Restoration. It is the monument of  Archbishop Bourchier, a staunch supporter of the House of York; he was  primate for thirty-two years, from 1454 to 1486, and crowned Edward IV.,  Richard III., and Henry VII. The \"Bourchier knot\" is among the decorations  which enrich the canopy of his tomb.    #The South-East Transept.#--According to the present custom of the  Canterbury vergers, the visitor is led from the choir to the south-east  transept. \"In the choir of Ernulf,\" says Willis, \"the transepts were cut  off from the body by the continuity of the pier-arches and the wall above,  and each transept was therefore a separate room with a flat ceiling....  But in the new design of William the transepts were opened to the central  portion, and the triforium and clerestory of the choir were turned at  right angles to their courses, and thus formed the side walls of the  transepts.... The entire interior of the eastern transept has been most  skilfully converted from Ernulfian architecture to Willelmian (if I may be  allowed the phrase for the nonce). It was necessary that the triforium and  clerestory of the new design should be carried along the walls of these  transepts, which were before the fire probably ornamented by a  continuation of those of Ernulf. But the respective level of these  essential members were so different in the old and new works that the  only parts of them that could be retained were the windows of the old  clerestory, which falls just above the new triforium tablet, and  accordingly these old windows may still be seen in the triforia of the  transepts, surmounted by the new pointed clerestory windows. But the whole  of the arcade work and mouldings in the interior of these transepts  belongs to William of Sens, with the sole exception of the lower windows.  Even the arches which open from the east wall of these transepts to the  apses have been changed for pointed arches, the piers of which have a  singularly elegant base.\"    In the two apses of this transept altars to St. Gregory and St. John once  stood, and here were shrines of four Saxon primates. There is a window in  the south wall erected to the memory of Dean Alford; below it is the spot  on which the tomb of Archbishop Winchelsea (1294-1313) was placed. He was  famous for his contest with Edward I. concerning clerical subsidies, and  for having secured from the king the confirmation of the charter. He was  more practically endeared to the people by the generosity of his  almsgiving--it is said that he distributed two thousand loaves among the  poor every Sunday and Thursday when corn was dear, and three thousand when  it was cheap. His tomb was heaped with offerings like the shrine of a  saint, but the Pope refused to confirm the popular enthusiasm by  canonizing the archbishop; the fact, however, that it had been so  reverenced was enough to qualify it for destruction in the days of Henry  VIII. This transept is used at present as a chapel for the King's School,  a direct continuation of the monastery school, at which Archbishops  Winchelsea and Kemp were both educated. It contains the Corinthian throne  which was set up in the choir early in the last century.    #The South-West Choir Aisle.#--At the corner of this aisle we may notice  the arcade which shows the combination of the Norman rounded arch and  double zigzag ornamentation with the pointed arch and dogtooth tracery of  William. Here also are two tombs, which have given rise to a good deal of  speculation. The more easterly one used to be regarded as the monument of  Hubert Walter, who was chancellor to Richard Coeur de Lion and followed  him and Archbishop Baldwin to Palestine, and, on the death of the latter,  was made primate in the camp at Acre: it is thought more probable,  however, in the light of recent research, that he is buried in the Trinity  Chapel. The other tomb used to be the resting place of Archbishop  Reynolds, the favourite of Edward II., but it also affords food for  discussion, as there is no trace of the \"pall\"--a Y-shaped strip of lamb's  wool marked with crosses, a special mark of metropolitan dignity which was  sent to each primate by the Pope--on the vestments of the effigy. Hence  conjecture doubts whether these tombs are tenanted by archbishops at all,  and inclines to the theory that they contain the bones of two of the  Priors, perhaps of d'Estria. From this point we can notice the ingenious  apparatus connected with the organ.    #St. Anselm's Tower and Chapel.#--Proceeding eastward, towards the Trinity  Chapel, we pause to examine the chapel or tower of St. Anselm, which  corresponds to that of St. Andrew on the north side of the cathedral. Both  these chapels probably at one time were much more lofty, as they are  described as \"lofty towers\" by Gervase; it was in order to bring them into  the church, when it was reconstructed after the fire, that the eastward  contraction, which presents such a curious effect as seen from the choir,  was found necessary. They are now, as Willis points out, \"only of the same  height as the clerestory of the Norman Church, to which they formed  appendages, and consequently they rose above the side-aisles of that  church as much as the clerestory did. The external faces of the inward  walls of these towers are now inclosed under the roof of William's  triforium, and it may be seen that they were once exposed to the weather.\"  The arches in St. Anselm's tower were originally set up by Ernulf, but  there is reason to believe that they were rebuilt after the great  conflagration. \"The arch of communication,\" says Willis, \"is a round  arch, at first sight plainly of the Ernulfian period, having plaited-work  capitals and mouldings with shallow hollows. A similar arch opens on the  eastern side of the tower into its apse. But a close examination will shew  that both these arches have undergone alteration.... I am inclined to  believe that both these arches were reset and reduced in space after the  fire, probably to increase their strength and that of their piers, on  account of the loss of abutment, when the circular wall of the choir-apse  was removed.\" The alterations that were made in these arches were probably  not important, and did not extend beyond the re-modelling of the mouldings  on the side of the arch towards the choir-aisle; for we may notice that  above both the arches we can still trace the notched decoration which is  peculiar to Ernulf's work. This chapel was originally dedicated to St.  Peter and St. Paul, and a very interesting relic of this saintly patronage  has lately been discovered. Apparently, in order to strengthen the  building, two of the three windows in the chapel were blocked up, and a  buttress was built across a chord of the apse, in the early part of the  thirteenth century. In the course of the restoration of the tower which  was recently carried out, this buttress was taken away, and its removal  laid bare a fresco painting, representing St. Paul and the viper at  Melita. This piece of decoration, as need hardly be said, must have been  put in before the construction of the buttress which has concealed and  preserved it for nearly seven centuries; it is conjectured, with a good  deal of reason, that a similar presentment of St. Paul  [Transcriber: St. Peter?] was painted at the same time on the opposite  wall, but as it had no buttress to protect it, it has been altogether  effaced. A copy of the fresco of St. Paul has been placed in the cathedral  library. The altar of SS. Peter and Paul stood at the east end, and behind  it was the tomb of the celebrated Archbishop Anselm, by whose name the  chapel is now commonly called. A very interesting feature of this tower  is a large and elaborate five-light window of the Decorated period. It  replaced the original south window of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#13)"],[1,"the big Wolf with the black mane, it  struck him that this was also the Cub of the old Yellow fury that he  had trapped.    These were among the things he told me as we sat by the fire at night.  I knew of the early days when any one could trap or poison Wolves, of  the passing of those days, with the passing of the simple Wolves; of  the new race of Wolves with new cunning that were defying the methods  of the ranchmen, and increasing steadily in numbers. Now the wolver  told me of the various ventures that Penroof had made with different  kinds of Hounds; of Foxhounds too thin-skinned to fight; of Greyhounds  that were useless when the animal was out of sight; of Danes too heavy  for the rough country, and, last, of the composite pack with some of  all kinds, including at times a Bull-terrier to lead them in the final  fight.    He told of hunts after Coyotes, which usually were successful because  the Coyotes sought the plains, and were easily caught by the  Greyhounds. He told of killing some small Gray-wolves with this very  pack, usually at the cost of the one that led them; but above all he  dwelt on the wonderful prowess of \"that thar cussed old Black Wolf of  Sentinel Butte,\" and related the many attempts to run him down or  corner him--an unbroken array of failures. For the big Wolf, with  exasperating persistence, continued to live on the finest stock of the  Penroof brand, and each year was teaching more Wolves how to do the  same with perfect impunity.    I listened even as gold-hunters listen to stories of treasure trove,  for these were the things of my world. These things indeed were  uppermost in all our minds, for the Penroof pack was lying around our  camp-fire now. We were out after Badlands Billy.      VIII    THE VOICE IN THE NIGHT AND THE BIG TRACK IN THE MORNING    One night late in September after the last streak of light was gone  from the west and the Coyotes had begun their yapping chorus, a deep,  booming sound was heard. King took out his pipe, turned his head and  said: \"That's him--that's old Billy. He's been watching us all day from  some high place, and now when the guns are useless he's here to have a  little fun with us.\"    Two or three Dogs arose, with bristling manes, for they clearly  recognized that this was no Coyote. They rushed out into the night, but  did not go far; their brawling sounds were suddenly varied by loud  yelps, and they came running back to the shelter of the fire. One was  so badly cut in the shoulder that he was useless for the rest of the  hunt. Another was hurt in the flank--it seemed the less serious wound,  and yet next morning the hunters buried that second Dog.    The men were furious. They vowed speedy vengeance, and at dawn were off  on the trail. The Coyotes yelped their dawning song, but they melted  into the hills when the light was strong. The hunters searched about  for the big Wolf's track, hoping that the Hounds would be able to take  it up and find him, but they either could not or would not.    They found a Coyote, however, and within a few hundred yards they  killed him. It was a victory, I suppose, for Coyotes kill Calves and  Sheep, but somehow I felt the common thought of all: \"Mighty brave Dogs  for a little Coyote, but they could not face the big Wolf last night.\"    Young Penroof, as though in answer to one of the unput questions, said:    \"Say, boys, I believe old Billy had a hull bunch of Wolves with him  last night.\"    \"Didn't see but one track,\" said King gruffly.    In this way the whole of October slipped by; all day hard riding after  doubtful trails, following the Dogs, who either could not keep the big  trail or feared to do so, and again and again we had news of damage  done by the Wolf; sometimes a cowboy would report it to us; and  sometimes we found the carcasses ourselves. A few of these we poisoned,  though it is considered a very dangerous thing to do while running  Dogs. The end of the month found us a weather-beaten, dispirited lot of  men, with a worn-out lot of Horses, and a foot-sore pack, reduced in  numbers from ten to seven. So far we had killed only one Gray-wolf and  three Coyotes; Badlands Billy had killed at least a dozen Cows and Dogs  at fifty dollars a head. Some of the boys decided to give it up and go  home, so King took advantage of their going, to send a letter, asking  for reenforcements including all the spare Dogs at the ranch.    During the two days' wait we rested our Horses, shot some game, and  prepared for a harder hunt. Late on the second day the new Dogs  arrived--eight beauties--and raised the working pack to fifteen.    The weather now turned much cooler, and in the morning, to the joy of  the wolvers, the ground was white with snow. This surely meant success.  With cool weather for the Dogs and Horses to run; with the big Wolf not  far away, for he had been heard the night before; and with tracking  snow, so that once found he could not baffle us,--escape for him was  impossible.    We were up at dawn, but before we could get away, three men came riding  into camp. They were the Penroof boys back again. The change of weather  had changed their minds; they knew that with snow we might have luck.    \"Remember now,\" said King, as all were mounting, \"we don't want any but  Badlands Billy this trip. Get him an' we kin bust up the hull  combination. It is a five-and-a-half-inch track.\"    And each measured off on his quirt handle, or on his glove, the exact  five and a half inches that was to be used in testing the tracks he  might find.    Not more than an hour elapsed before we got a signal from the rider who  had gone westward. One shot: that means \"attention,\" a pause while  counting ten, then two shots: that means \"come on.\"    King gathered the Dogs and rode direct to the distant figure on the  hill. All hearts beat high with hope, and we were not disappointed.  Some small Wolf tracks had been found, but here at last was the big  track, nearly six inches long. Young Penroof wanted to yell and set out  at full gallop. It was like hunting a Lion; it was like finding  happiness long deferred. The hunter knows nothing more inspiring than  the clean-cut line of fresh tracks that is leading to a wonderful  animal, he has long been hunting in vain. How King's eye gleamed as he  gloated over the sign!      IX    RUN DOWN AT LAST    It was the roughest of all rough riding. It was a far longer hunt than  we had expected, and was full of little incidents, for that endless  line of marks was a minute history of all that the big Wolf had done  the night before. Here he had circled at the telephone box and looked  for news; there he had paused to examine an old skull; here he had  shied off and swung cautiously up wind to examine something that proved  to be an old tin can; there at length he had mounted a low hill and sat  down, probably giving the muster-howl, for two Wolves had come to him  from different directions, and they then had descended to the river  flat where the Cattle would seek shelter during the storm. Here all  three had visited a Buffalo skull; there they trotted in line; and  yonder they separated, going three different ways, to  meet--yes--here--oh, what a sight, a fine Cow ripped open, left dead  and uneaten. Not to their taste, it seems, for see! within a mile is  another killed by them. Not six hours ago, they had feasted. Here their  trails scatter again, but not far, and the snow tells plainly how each  had lain down to sleep. The Hounds' manes bristled as they sniffed  those places. King had held the Dogs well in hand, but now they were  greatly excited. We came to a hill whereon the Wolves had turned and  faced our way, then fled at full speed,--so said the trail,--and now it  was clear that they had watched us from that hill, and were not far  away.    The pack kept well together, because the Greyhounds, seeing no quarry,  were merely puttering about among the other Dogs, or running back with  the Horses. We went as fast as we could, for the Wolves were speeding.  Up mesas and down coulees we rode, sticking closely to the Dogs, though  it was the roughest country that could be picked. One gully after  another, an hour and another hour, and still the threefold track went  bounding on; another hour and no change, but interminable climbing,  sliding, struggling, through brush and over boulders, guided by the  far-away yelping of the Dogs.    Now the chase led downward to the low valley of the river, where there  was scarcely any snow. Jumping and scrambling down hills, recklessly  leaping dangerous gullies and slippery rocks, we felt that we could not  hold out much longer; when on the lowest, dryest level the pack split,  some went up, some went down, and others straight on. Oh, how King did  swear! He knew at once what it meant. The Wolves had scattered, and so  had divided the pack. Three Dogs after a Wolf would have no chance,  four could not kill him, two would certainly be killed. And yet this  was the first encouraging sign we had seen, for it meant that the  Wolves were hard pressed. We spurred ahead to stop the Dogs, to pick  for them the only trail. But that was not so easy. Without snow here  and with countless Dog tracks, we were foiled. All we could do was to  let the Dogs choose, but keep them to a single choice. Away we went as  before, hoping, yet fearing that we were not on the right track. The  Dogs ran well, very fast indeed. This was a bad sign, King said, but we  could not get sight of the track because the Dogs overran it before we  came.    After a two-mile run the chase led upward again in snow country; the  Wolf was sighted, but to our disgust, we were on the track of the  smallest one.    \"I thought so,\" growled young Penroof. \"Dogs was altogether too keen  for a serious proposition. Kind o' surprised it ain't turned out a  Jack-rabbit.\"    Within another mile he had turned to bay in a willow thicket. We heard  him howl the long-drawn"]]]
