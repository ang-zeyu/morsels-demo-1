In summer I like lily pads and always get them  when I can.\"    \"Can you swim?\" asked Peter eagerly.    \"Of course,\" grunted Prickly Porky.    \"I never see you out on the Green Meadows,\" said Peter.    \"And you never will,\" retorted Prickly Porky.  \"The Green Forest  for me every time.  Summer or winter, I'm at home there.\"    \"Don't you sleep through the cold weather the way Buster Bear and  I do?\" asked Johnny Chuck.    \"What should I sleep for?\" grumbled Prickly Porky.  \"Cold weather  doesn't bother me.  I like it.  I have the Green Forest pretty much  to myself then.  I like to be alone.  And as long as there are trees,  there is plenty to eat.  I sleep a great deal in the daytime because  I like night best.\"    \"What about your home?\" asked Happy Jack.    \"Home is wherever I happen to be, most of the time, but Mrs. Porky  has a home in a hollow log or a cave or under the roots of a tree  where the babies are born.  I guess that's all I've got to tell you.\"    \"You might add that those babies are big for the size of their  mother and have a full supply of quills when they are born,\" said  Old Mother Nature.  \"And you forgot to say how fond of salt you  are, and how often this fondness gets you into trouble around the  camps of men.  Your fear of Pekan the Fisher we all saw.  I might  add that Puma the Panther is to be feared at times, and when he  is very hungry Buster Bear will take a chance on turning you on  your back.  By the way, don't any of you call Prickly Porky a  Hedgehog.  He isn't any thing of the kind.  He is sometimes called  a Quill Pig, but his real name, Porcupine, is best.  He has no  near relatives.  Tomorrow morning, instead of meeting here, we'll  hold school on the shore of the pond Paddy the Beaver has made.  School is dismissed.\"        CHAPTER XII  A Lumberman and Engineer    Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk were the only ones who were not  on hand at the pond of Paddy the Beaver deep in the Green Forest  at sun-up the next morning.  Johnny and Striped Chipmunk were  afraid to go so far from home.  To the surprise of everybody,  Prickly Porky was there.    \"He must have traveled all night to get here he is such a slow-poke,\"  said Peter Rabbit to his cousin, Jumper the Hare.    Peter wasn't far from the truth.  But how ever he got there, there  he was, reaching for lily pads from an old log which lay half in  the water, and appearing very well satisfied with life.  You know  there is nothing like a good meal of things you like, to make  everything seem just as it should.    Old Mother Nature seated herself on one end of Paddy's dam and  called the school to order.  Just as she did so a brown head  popped out of the water close by and a pair of anxious eyes looked  up at Old Mother Nature.    \"It is quite all right, Paddy,\" said she softly.  \"These little  folks are trying to gain a little knowledge of themselves and  other folks, and we are going to have this morning's lesson right  here because it is to be about you.\"    Paddy the Beaver no longer looked anxious.  There was a sparkle in  his eyes.  \"May I stay?\" he asked eagerly.  \"If there is a chance  to learn anything I don't want to miss it.\"    Before Old Mother Nature could reply Peter Rabbit spoke up.  \"But  the lesson is to be about you and your family.  Do you expect to  learn anything about yourself?\" he demanded, and chuckled as if he  thought that a great joke.    \"It seems to me that some one named Peter learned a great deal about  his own family when he first came to school to me,\" said Old Mother  Nature.  Peter had grace enough to hang his head and look ashamed.  \"Of course you may stay, Paddy.  In fact, I want you to.  There are  some things I shall want you to explain.  That is why we are holding  school over here this morning.  Just come up here on your dam where  we can all get a good look at you.\"    Paddy the Beaver climbed out on his dam.  It was the first time  Happy Jack Squirrel ever had seen him out of water, and Happy Jack  gave a little gasp of surprise.  \"I had no idea he is so big!\"  he exclaimed.    \"He is the biggest of all the Rodents in this country, and one of  the biggest in all the Great World.  Also he is the smartest  member of the whole order,\" said Old Mother Nature.    \"He doesn't look it,\" said Chatterer the Squirrel with a saucy  jerk of his tail.    \"Which means, I suppose, that you haven't the least doubt that you  are quite as smart as he,\" said Old Mother Nature quietly, and  Chatterer looked both guilty and a little bit ashamed.  \"I'll admit  that you are smart, Chatterer, but often it is in a wrong way.  Paddy is smart in the very best way.  He is a lumberman, builder  and engineer.  A lot of my little people are workers, but they are  destructive workers.  The busier they are, the more they destroy.  Paddy the Beaver is a constructive worker.  That means that he is a  builder instead of a destroyer.\"    \"How about all those trees he cuts down?  If that isn't destroying,  I don't know what is!\" said Chatterer, and with each word jerked  his tail as if somehow his tongue and tail were connected.    \"So it is,\" replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly.  \"But just  think of the number of trees you destroy.\"    \"I never have destroyed a tree in my life!\" declared  Chatterer indignantly.    \"Yes, you have,\" retorted Old Mother Nature.    \"I never have!\" contradicted Chatterer, quite forgetting to whom  he was speaking.    But Old Mother Nature overlooked this.  \"I don't suppose you ever  ate a chestnut or a fat hickory nut or a sweet beechnut,\" said  she softly.    \"Of course,\" retorted Chatterer sharply.  \"I've eaten ever and  ever and ever so many of them.  What of it?\"    In the heart of each one was a little tree, explained Old Mother  Nature.  \"But for you very many of those little trees would have  sprung up and some day would have made big trees.  So you see for  every tree Paddy has destroyed you probably have destroyed a  hundred.  You eat the nuts that you may live.  Paddy cuts down the  trees that he may live, for the bark of those trees is his food.  Like Prickly Porky he lives chiefly on bark.  But, unlike Prickly  Porky, he doesn't destroy a tree for the bark alone.  He wastes  nothing.  He makes use of every bit of that tree.  He does something  for the Green Forest in return for the trees he takes.\"    Chatterer looked at Happy Jack and blinked in a puzzled way.  Happy Jack looked at Peter Rabbit and blinked.  Peter looked at  Jumper the Hare and blinked.  Jumper looked at Prickly Porky and  blinked.  Then all looked at Paddy the Beaver and finally at Old  Mother Nature, and all blinked.  Old Mother Nature chuckled.    \"Don't you think the Green Forest is more beautiful because of  this little pond?\" she asked.  Everybody nodded.  \"Of course,\" she  continued.  \"But there wouldn't be any little pond here were it  not for Paddy and the trees he has cut.  He destroyed the trees in  order to make the pond.  That is what I meant when I called him a  constructive worker.  Now I want you all to take a good look at  Paddy.  Then he will show us just how as a lumberman he cuts  trees, as a builder he constructs houses and dams, and as an  engineer he digs canals.\"    As Paddy sat there on his dam, he looked rather like a giant member  of the Rat family, though his head was more like that of a Squirrel  than a Rat.  His body was very thick and heavy, and in color he  was dark brown, lighter underneath than above.  Squatting there  on the dam his back was rounded.  All together, he was a very  clumsy-looking fellow.    Peter Rabbit appeared to be interested in just one thing, Paddy's  tail.  He couldn't keep his eyes off it.    Old Mother Nature noticed this.  \"Well, Peter,\" said she, \"what  have you on your mind now?\"    \"That tail,\" replied Peter.  \"That's the queerest tail I've ever  seen.  I should think it would be heavy and dreadfully in the way.\"    Old Mother Nature laughed.  \"If you ask him Paddy will tell you  that that tail is the handiest tail in the Green Forest,\" said she.  \"There isn't another like it in all the Great World, and if you'll  be patient you will see just how handy it is.\"    It was a queer-looking tail.  It was broad and thick and flat, oval  in shape, and covered with scales instead of hair.  Just then Jumper  the Hare made a discovery.  \"Why!\" he exclaimed, \"Paddy has feet  like Honker the Goose!\"    \"Only my hind feet,\" said Paddy.  \"They have webs between the toes  just as Honker's have.  That is for swimming.  But there are no  webs between my fingers.\"  He held up a hand for all to see.  Sure  enough, the fingers were free.    \"Now that everybody has had a good look at you, Paddy,\" said Old  Mother Nature, \"suppose you swim over to where you have been  cutting trees.  We will join you there, and then you can show us  just how you work.\"    Paddy slipped into the water, where for a second or two he floated  with just his head above the surface.  Then he quickly raised his  broad, heavy tail and brought it down on the water with a slap that  sounded like the crack of a terrible gun.  It was so loud and  unexpected that every one save Old Mother Nature and Prickly Porky  jumped with fright.  Peter Rabbit happened to be right on the edge  of the dam and, because he jumped before he had time to think, he  jumped right into the water with a splash.  Now Peter doesn't like  the water, as you know, and he scrambled out just as fast as ever  he could.  How the others did laugh at him.    \"What did he do that for?\" demanded Peter indignantly.  \"To show  you one use he has for that handy tail,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"That is the way he gives warning to his friends whenever he  discovers danger.  Did you notice how he used his tail to aid him  in swimming?  He turns it almost on edge and uses it as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#13)"],[1,"among the crowd. As the words of worship--I might  rather say the spells--they have been instructed to use are not  whispered but uttered, and by many with a loud voice, a stream of sound  falls on the ear. If, at some spot where bathers are not inconvenienced,  the boat be moored, and the visitor ascends the steps, he may find on  certain days, in two or three places, pundits reading and explaining the  Ramayan, or the Mahabharut, the great Hindu Epic Poems, to a crowd of  people, mainly composed of women. Sentence by sentence is read from  poetical translations made long ago, which require to be re-translated  into the ordinary language of the people to be generally intelligible.  We have occasionally stopped to hear these pundits, and, judging by what  we heard, we concluded they satisfied themselves with a loose paraphrase  of what they were reading. These men are rewarded with a respectful and  attentive hearing, and with something more substantial when the work is  over.    If the visitor is bent on obtaining a full impression of the work  continually carried on in Benares, he will make his way into the city  from one of the principal bathing-places. He will speedily find himself  in long narrow streets, with lofty stone houses on either side. The  buildings are of hewn stone, and of the most substantial description.  They have for the most part a narrow doorway, opening into a quadrangle,  around which are the apartments of the inmates. The streets are so  narrow that through some of them a vehicle cannot be taken, and in  others conveyances pass each other with difficulty. There are parts of  the narrower streets and lanes on which the sun never shines. In the few  cases where houses on both sides of the street opposite each other  belong to one proprietor, there is at the top a bridge by which the  inmates pass from one to the other.    [Sidenote: WORSHIP IN THE TEMPLES.]    Not the houses, however, but the temples, secure the chief attention of  the visitor. They are seen on every side. Numerous though they be, they  are not sufficient to meet the demands of the people. At every few steps  objects of worship meet your view. In niches of the walls are little  images, so worn by the weather and by the water poured on them by  worshippers that it is difficult to determine what they are intended to  represent. At your feet, close to the walls, you see misshapen stones  which are regarded as sacred. As you proceed you find yourself  accompanied by a crowd who have bathed, and who are going to complete  their morning worship by acts of obeisance to their gods. They are seen,  as they walk, bowing their heads and folding their hands before the  sacred objects that line their way. Every now and then one of a party  will raise the shout \"_Mahadeo jee kee jae!_\"--(\"Victory to the Great  God\"), that is to Shiva, to whom this title is given; and the shout is  taken up and repeated by others till the street resounds. It has  occurred to me that this is done with peculiar force when Europeans are  within hearing.    [Sidenote: THE TEMPLE OF BISHESHWAR.]    You speedily find yourself at the principal temple of Benares--the  temple of Bisheshwar, sacred to Shiva under this name, which means _Lord  of All_. This temple is in the midst of a quadrangle, covered in with a  roof; over it are a tower, a dome, and a spire. The tower and dome  glitter in the sun like masses of burnished gold, and on this account  it is called the Golden Temple. Natives will tell you that it is covered  with plates of solid gold, but in fact it is merely gilded with gold  leaf, spread over plates of copper overlaying the stones beneath. Under  the dome is a belfry in which nine bells are suspended, and these are so  low that they can be tolled by the hand of those who frequent the  temple. We are told that the temple, including the tower, is fifty-one  feet in height. \"Outside the enclosure is a large collection of deities,  raised upon a platform, called by the natives 'The Court of Mahadeo.'\"  Though the gods in the Hindu books are represented as continually  quarrelling with each other, and their devotees take up their quarrels,  not only at the temple of Bisheshwar, but throughout the city which is  regarded as Shiva's own, they are seen side by side, as in perfect  amity, and there is not a single god who does not secure the special  devotion of some worshippers. It is, however, required of all who dwell  in Kasee, or frequent it, to acknowledge that Mahadeo is entitled to  supreme homage, and that to him in the first instance obeisance must be  made. The symbol of Shiva, or Mahadeo, which is found wherever he is  worshipped, is the _Linga_, a conical stone, which does not in itself  suggest any impure notion, but which is intended to be a vile  representation. In this famous temple this conical stone receives  special honour. There, too, are figures of Shiva himself in all his  hideousness, with his three eyes, covered with ashes, and his eyes  inflamed with intoxicating herbs. Outside the temple there is a figure  cut in stone of a bull seven feet high, sacred to the god, as this is  his favourite animal for riding. Within the quadrangle there is a well  called _Gyan Bapee_, the well of knowledge, to which it is said the god  betook himself when he was expelled from his former temple by the bigot  Emperor Aurungzeb. On this account the well is deemed specially sacred.  It is surmounted by a handsome low-roofed colonnade with forty pillars.  It is covered with an iron grating, in which there is an aperture for  small vessels to be let down into it, which when full are drawn up, and  the water thus drawn is highly prized. As from day to day a large  quantity of flowers are thrown into it, it may be supposed how horrible  its water and how offensive its smell; it is a wonder the people are not  poisoned by it.    We must not proceed further with this description of Bisheshwar's  temple. Those who wish for more information can find it in the ample  details given by Mr. Sherring.    To this temple thousands resort every day. It is open, and priests are  present, we are told, twenty hours in the twenty-four. It is only shut  from midnight till four in the morning. The temple itself holds a very  small number, and the entire quadrangle would be crowded by one of our  large congregations. The people press into it in one continuous stream,  toll a bell to draw the attention of the god, make their obeisance, pour  on the object of their worship a little of the Ganges water from the  small brazen vessel they have in their hand, throw on it some flowers,  give a present to the attendant priests, go round the building with  their right hand towards it, and pass away to give place to others.    How does the visitor regard this scene? Apart from the consideration of  the dishonour done to the ever-blessed God by worship rendered to images  representing gods that are no gods--by which, if a Christian, he must be  painfully affected--there is much in the scene before him to impress  him with the sottish folly into which man can sink in his religious  views and practices; and there is nothing to draw forth his regard and  sympathy, except it be the fervour, the deep though mistaken fervour, of  some of the worshippers, especially of the women, who may sometimes be  seen with children in their arms teaching them to make obeisance to the  idol. In Roman Catholic worship there is much which, as Protestants  ruled by the Bible, we rightly condemn; but in the gorgeous vestments of  its priests, in the magnificence of many of the places in which they  minister, in the grand strains of their music and in their processions,  there is much to impress the senses and awe the mind; but in the worship  carried on in the temple of Bisheshwar it is difficult to find a  redeeming quality. The whole scene is repulsive. The place is sloppy  with the water poured out by the worshippers, and is littered by the  flowers they present. The ear is assailed with harsh sounds. The  ministering priests--Pundas as they are called--are, as a rule,  coarse-looking men, with shaven head, save with a long pendent tuft from  the crown, with the mark of their god on their forehead, and are very  scantily attired. They clamour for a present when a European appears,  and if given it is declared to be an offering to the god of the place.  Among the crowd you see men with matted hair and body bedaubed with  ashes, who have broken away from all domestic and social duties, and  devote themselves to what is called a religious life. Some of these  ascetics are no doubt impelled to follow the life they lead by a  superstitious feeling, but many are idle vagabonds ready for the  practice of every villainy, who find it more pleasant to roam about the  land and live on others than support themselves by honest labour. The  people dread their curse, but many give them neither respect nor love.  At a place like Bisheshwar's temple there is always a host of ordinary  beggars, who clamour for alms, and receive from some two or three  shells, called _cowries_, sixty of which go to make up a halfpenny, from  others a little grain, and from the more liberal or more wealthy a small  coin.    [Sidenote: THE MOSQUE OF AURUNGZEB.]    From this stirring scene you have only a few steps to go to find  yourself in the large mosque built by the Emperor Aurungzeb on the site  of the old temple of Bisheshwar, which was thrown down to give place to  it. The contrast is very striking. You have left the bustling, noisy  crowd, and see only a few individuals in the attitude of devotion--now  standing with folded hands, then on their knees, then with forehead  touching the floor, engaged in supplicating the Invisible One. Instead  of grotesque and repulsive images meeting your view, you see very little  ornament of any kind, and are impressed with the severe simplicity of  the lofty building. The more one knows "]]]
