This becomes more tasty if left with the olives for one or two  days.      156    STEWED BEEF TONGUE    (Lingua di bue in stufato)    Clean a fresh tongue of beef; put it in a plate, salt it generously and  put it back in the ice-box or in the pantry, until the following day.    After twenty-four hours, scald it in boiling water, skin and lard with  little pieces of bacon and put it in a kettle or a large saucepan in  which the seasoning is already placed. This seasoning consists of 1/2  lb. bacon cut in very thin slices, 1/4 lb. butter, one or two thin  slices of ham and two middle sized onions, sliced. Sprinkle the tongue  with flour, surround it with chopped meat and place the saucepan on the  fire. When the tongue begins to brown, pour five or six cups of soup  stock and one cup of water. Add the usual bunch of greens, two or three  cloves, salt, a pinch of pepper and one of cinnamon.    Cover the saucepan tightly, boil for about four hours, rub the sauce  through a sieve and serve everything hot.      157    VEAL SWEETBREADS    (Animelle di vitello)    Keep in fresh water for an hour. Then place them in a skimmer (ladle  with holes) and dip in boiling water or broth. After a brief boiling  remove and cool in cold water. Then remove the veins and gullet, taking  care not to tear them. The sweetbreads are prepared in various ways and  here we give some of the best known:    =Sweetbreads with butter.=--Boil in broth or water, clean and cut into  slices. Brown a piece of butter with salt and pepper. Then place the  sliced sweetbreads and brown them. Before serving squeeze on a little  lemon juice. The sweetbreads prepared in this way are served preferably  with rice or vegetables.    =Sweetbreads with white sauce.=--Boiled, cleaned and cut into slices,  they are placed in white sauce or =balsamella= (No. 54) adding a taste  of nutmeg, pepper, salt and the juice of half a lemon.    =Sweetbreads in fricassee.=--Boil, trim and cut into pieces. Then brown  in butter with a scallion chopped fine. Once browned, remove from the  gravy in which pour a tablespoonful of flour, moistened with broth. The  sauce that results is bound with egg-yolks and lemon juice.    =Sweetbreads fried.=--Boil and trim. Then cut in large slices, neither  too thick nor too thin. Dip in beaten egg and in bread crumbs ground.  Then fry in butter. Serve with vegetables.      158    TENDERLOIN WITH SPICES    (Filetto alla piemontese)    Clean and trim the meat, removing all the little skins. Then sprinkle  with nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, and pepper, and place in an earthen vase  covered, together with a bunch of aromatic herbs, sage, parsley,  rosemary, onion, carrot and celery, all chopped fine. After a few hours  melt and brown a piece of butter with the aromatic herbs, then remove  the latter and place the tenderloin, leaving it to simmer for half an  hour, pricking it often with a large fork or a larding pin, to add its  juice to the gravy. Serve hot.      159    STUFFED ONIONS    (Cipolle ripiene)    Boil six large onions for an hour. Then drain and skin. Remove the heart  with the point of a knife. In the place of the heart place the stuffing  made with 1/4 lb. ham or tongue, chopped and mixed with bread crumbs  ground, two tablespoonfuls of milk, two pinches of salt and one of  pepper. When the onions are prepared and stuffed place them in a  saucepan whose bottom has been greased with butter, sprinkle with bread  crumbs ground and place in the oven, not too hot. At the time of serving  add some white sauce or =balsamella= (No 54). Stuffed onions are served  as vegetables, or side-dish with roast-beef or boiled-beef.      160    STEWED ONIONS    (Cipolle in stufato)    Keep in cold water, for half an hour, two pounds of middle-sized onions.  Afterward skin and place in a saucepan in which pour as much broth as is  necessary to cover them. Let them cook on a low fire for an hour, if  they are scallions, or young onions. If they are not, two hours are not  enough, sometimes.    When cooked and soft, drain and place in a large deep dish. Brown a  piece of butter with a tablespoonful of flour, a cup of broth, salt and  pepper. Mix everything and when it begins to boil pour the sauce on the  onions, which must be served hot.      161    VEAL LIVER    (Fegato di vitella alla veneziana)    Brown a large onion cut in thin slices in oil and place in the saucepan  the liver cut in thin slices. Brown everything on a strong fire. When  the liver takes a reddish color it is ready. If it is overdone, it  becomes too hard. Salt just before removing from the saucepan.      162    FRIED LIVER    (Fegato al tegame)    Clean and trim the liver, then cut in slices half an inch thick. Dip in  flour and place, without delay in a saucepan in which a small onion has  been browned in butter. Salt just before serving.      163    POLENTA WITH SAUSAGES    (Polenta colle salsicce)    The polenta is a very popular dish in Northern Italy and can be  prepared in various ways. Always, however, it is better to serve with  the addition of sausages, or with birds or tomato paste.    The =polenta= is practically cornmeal and it is made with the so-called  =farina gialla= or yellow flour.    The ingredients for a good polenta are one pound of corn meal,  preferably granulous, one quart and a half of water, salted in  proportion, one piece of butter, one cup and a half of milk.    Pour the meal little by little into boiling water, continually stirring  with a wooden spoon. When the meal is half cooked, put the butter and  pour the milk little by little. While the =polenta= boils, place on the  fire in a little saucepan a tablespoonful of olive oil or a small piece  of butter. When the oil is hot or the butter is melted, put some  sausages repeatedly pricked with a fork.    When the sausages are cooked, pour the polenta hot in a dish and place  the sausages and the gravy in a cavity practised in the middle. Serve  hot.    In cooking the sausages two or three bay-leaves may be added and removed  before serving.      164    SAUSAGES WITH ONIONS    (Salsicce alla cipollata)    The =salsicce alla cipollata= are prepared with fresh and lean pork meat  and bacon in equal quantity, chopped fine and seasoned with salt,  pepper and spices. Add a proportional quantity of onions chopped very  fine, not too much, however. Fill with the hash the prepared entrails,  tie every two inches to divide the sausages.      CELERY    (Sedano)    Beside being used as a condiment with a great quantity of dishes, the  celery may be prepared in various different ways to form appetizing  vegetable dishes. We give here a certain number of those that appear  most commonly on Italian tables:      165    CELERY WITH BUTTER    (Sedano al burro)    Two heads of celery for each person.    Clean and trim, removing the sprigs that are too hard, and the leaves,  that are to be cut where they begin to be green. Finally trim the stem.  Then wash repeatedly in running water, drain and put to boil in salted  boiling water. Remove when cooked and drain again.    About three quarters of an hour before serving, melt a piece of butter  in a saucepan and brown the celery, turning them often for about ten  minutes. After that pour over hot stock (soup stock or chicken broth)  cover the saucepan and parboil. A few moments before serving season with  brown stock, if you have any at hand, otherwise with salt and pepper  only.      166    CELERY AU JUS    (Sedano al sugo)    Select nine or ten heads, neither too hard nor too soft, and cut them  about four inches from the root. Remove the green and hard branches and  trim the root, cutting the latter to a point. Scald the celery, after  washing well, in salted boiling water. Ten minutes will be sufficient.  Dip in cold water, open well the leaves and wash again carefully. Drain  and make bunches of two or three heads each that you will put in a  saucepan with a pint of broth or water and half a cup of good fat, onion  and carrot chopped, salt and pepper. Cover and let it simmer for about  two hour. Then remove the celery, drain and serve.      167    SAUCE FOR CELERY AU JUS    (Salsa per sedani al sugo)    The celery, prepared as above, are seasoned with the following sauce:  Make a =roux= melting a piece of butter and browning an equal weight of  flour; stir for about three minutes on the fire, after which thin the  roux with a little brown stock or with bouillon cubes diluted in water.  Continue stirring and reduce the sauce. Then rub through a sieve, pour  over the celery and serve very hot.      168    FRIED CELERY    (Sedani fritti)    This is a convenient way to prepare left-over celery that is still too  good to be thrown away.    Clean the left-over celery removing as best you can the sauce in which  they were served, dip in frying paste (flour and egg) fry and serve with  lemon.      169    PUREE OF CELERY    (Macco di sedani)    Take some big roots of celery, prepare as usual and wash in running  water. Boil in salted water, crush and rub through a sieve. Put in a  saucepan this puree, with a piece of butter, salt, flour and a little  cream or milk. The milk may be substituted with good soup stock or brown  stock. Just before serving add a little powdered sugar.      170    STEW    (Stufato)    The Italian =stufato= is somewhat different from the stewed meat that  is known under the name of \"Irish stew\". It corresponds to the French  =daube= and is prepared in Italy in many different ways.    An excellent =stufato= can be made in the following way: Chop fine two  bunches of parsley, a small carrot, half a medium sized onion, a little  piece of scallion and two bay-leaves. Brown with a good piece of butter  in a saucepan in which one and a half tablespoonful of oil have been  previously poured.    The meat must have been prepared beforehand, that is to say washed,  trimmed and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#13)"],[1,"among the clothes when they are laid aside for  the summer; and furs and other small articles can be kept by being sewed  in bags with bits of camphor wood, red cedar, or of Spanish cedar; while  the cloth lining of carriages can be secured forever from the attacks of  moths by being washed or sponged on both sides with a solution of the  corrosive sublimate of mercury in alcohol, made just strong enough not  to leave a white stain on a black feather.\" The moths can be most  readily killed by pouring benzine among them, though its use must be  much restricted from the disagreeable odor which remains. The recent  experiments made with carbolic acid, however, convince us that this will  soon take the place of other substances as a preventive and destroyer of  noxious insects.    [Illustration: The Juniper Sickle-wing.]          CHAPTER VI.    THE MOSQUITO AND ITS FRIENDS.      The subject of flies becomes of vast moment to a Pharaoh, whose ears are  dinned with the buzz of myriad winged plagues, mingled with angry cries  from malcontent and fly-pestered subjects; or to the summer traveller in  northern lands, where they oppose a stronger barrier to his explorations  than the loftiest mountains or the broadest streams; or to the African  pioneer, whose cattle, his main dependence, are stung to death by the  Tsetze fly; or the fariner whose eyes on the evening of a warm spring  day, after a placid contemplation of his growing acres of wheat blades,  suddenly detects in dismay clouds of the Wheat midge and Hessian fly  hovering over their swaying tops. The subject, indeed, has in such cases  a national importance, and a few words regarding the main points in the  habits of flies--how they grow, how they do not grow (after assuming the  winged state), and how they bite; for who has not endured the smart and  sting of these dipterous Shylocks, that almost torment us out of our  existence while taking their drop of our heart's blood--may be welcome to  our readers.    [Illustration: 61. Head of the Mosquito.]    The Mosquito will be our first choice. As she leaps off from her light  bark, the cast chrysalis skin of her early life beneath the waters, and  sails away in the sunlight, her velvety wings fringed with silken hairs,  and her neatly bodiced trim figure (though her nose is rather salient,  considering that it is half as long as her entire body), present a  beauty and grace of form and movement quite unsurpassed by her dipterous  allies. She draws near and softly alights upon the hand of the charmed  beholder, subdues her trumpeting notes, folds her wings noiselessly upon  her back, daintily sets down one foot after the other, and with an  eagerness chastened by the most refined delicacy for the feelings of her  victim, and with the air of Velpeau redivivus, drives through crushed  and bleeding capillaries, shrinking nerves and injured tissues, a  many-bladed lancet of marvellous fineness, of wonderful complexity and  fitness. While engorging herself with our blood, we will examine under  the microscope the mosquito's mouth. The head (Fig. 61) is rounded, with  the two eyes occupying a large part of the surface, and nearly meeting  on the top of the head. Out of the forehead, so to speak, grow the long,  delicate, hairy antennm (_a_), and just below arises the long beak which  consists of the bristle-like maxillae (_mx_, with their palpi, _mp_) and  mandibles (_m_), and the single hair-like labrum, these five  bristle-like organs being laid in the hollowed labium (_l_). Thus massed  into a single awl-like beak, the mosquito, without any apparent effort,  thrusts them all except the labium into the flesh. Her hind body may be  seen tilling with the red blood, until it cries quits, and the insect  withdraws its sting and flies sluggishly away. In a moment the wounded  parts itch slightly, though a very robust person may not notice the  irritation, or a more delicate individual if asleep; though if weakened  by disease, or if stung in a highly vascular and sensitive part, such as  the eyelid, the bite becomes really a serious matter. Multiply the  mosquito a thousand fold, and one flees their attacks and avoids their  haunts as he would a nest of hornets. Early in spring the larva (Fig.  62, A) of the mosquito may be found in pools and ditches. It remains at  the bottom feeding upon decaying matter (thus acting as a scavenger, and  in this state doing great benefit in clearing swamps of miasms), until  it rises to the surface for air, which it inhales through a single  respiratory tube (_c_) situated near the tail. When about to transform  into the pupa state, it contracts and enlarges anteriorly near the  middle, the larval skin is thrown off, and the insect appears in quite a  different form (Fig. 62, a). The head and thorax are massed together,  the rudiments of the mouth parts and of the wings and legs being folded  upon the breast, while there are two breathing tubes (_d_) situated upon  the back instead of the tail, which ends in two broad paddles (_a_); so  that it comes to the surface, head foremost instead of tail first, a  position according better with its increased age and experience in pond  life. In a few days the pupa skin is cast; the insect, availing itself  of its old habiliments as a raft upon which to float while its body is  drying, grows lighter, and its wings expand for its marriage flight. The  males are beautiful, both physically and morally, as they do not bite;  their manners are more retiring than those of their stronger minded  partners, as they rarely enter our dwellings, and live unnoticed in the  woods. They may be easily distinguished from the females by their long  maxillary palpi, and their thick, bushy, feathered antennae. The female  lays her elongated, oval eggs in a boat-shaped mass, which floats on the  water. A mosquito lives three or four weeks in the water before changing  to the adult or winged stage. How many days they live in the latter  state we do not know.    [Illustration: 62. Larva and Pupa of the Mosquito.]    Our readers will understand, then, that all flies, like our mosquito for  example, grow while in the larva and pupa state, _and after they acquire  wings do not grow_, so that the small midges are not young mosquitoes,  but the adult winged forms of an entirely different species and genus of  fly; and the myriads of small flies, commonly supposed to be the young  of larger flies, are adult forms belonging to different species of  different genera, and perhaps of different families of the suborder of  Diptera. The typical species of the genus Culex, to which the mosquito  belongs, is Culex pipiens, described by Linnaeus, and there are already  over thirty North American species of this genus described in various  works. Few insects live in the sea, but along the coast of New England  a small, slender white larva (Fig. 63a, magnified, and head greatly  enlarged; Fig. 64, pupa and fore foot of larva, showing the hooks),  whose body is no thicker than a knitting needle, lives between tides,  and has even been dredged at a depth of over a hundred feet, which  transforms into a yellow mosquito-like fly (Fig. 65, with head of the  female, magnified) which swarms in summer in immense numbers. I have  called it provisionally Chironomus oceanicus, or Ocean gnat. The larvae  of other species have been found by Mr. S. I. Smith living at great  depths in our Northern lakes. These kinds of gnats are usually seen  early in spring hovering in swarms in mid air.    [Illustration: 65. Ocean Gnat.]    [Illustration: 63. Larva of Ocean Gnat.]    [Illustration: 64. Pupa of Ocean Gnat.]    The strange fact has been discovered by Grimm, a Russian naturalist,  that the pupa of a feathered gnat is capable of laying eggs which  produce young during the summer time. Previous to this it had been  discovered that a larva of a gnat (Fig. 66 _a_, eggs from which the  young are produced) which lives under the bark of trees in Europe, also  produced young born alive.    The Hessian fly (Fig. 67, _a_, larva; _b_ pupa; _c_, stalk of wheat  injured by larvae) and Wheat midge, which are allied to the mosquito, are  briefly referred to in the calendar, so that we pass over these to  consider another pest of our forests and prairies.    [Illustration: 66. Viviparous gall larva.]    [Illustration: 67. Hessian Fly and its Young.]    The Black fly is even a more formidable pest than the mosquito. In the  northern, subarctic regions, it opposes a barrier against travel. The  Labrador fisherman spends his summer on the sea shore, scarcely daring  to penetrate the interior on account of the swarms of these flies.  During a summer residence on this coast, we sailed up the Esquimaux  river for six or eight miles, spending a few hours at a house situated  on the bank. The day was warm and but little wind blowing, and the  swarms of black flies were absolutely terrific. In vain we frantically  waved our net among them, allured by some rare moth; after making a few  desperate charges in the face of the thronging pests, we had to retire  to the house, where the windows actually swarmed with them; but here  they would fly in our faces, crawl under one's clothes, where they even  remain and bite in the night. The children in the house were sickly and  worn by their unceasing torments; and the shaggy Newfoundland dogs whose  thick coats would seem to be proof against their bites ran from their  shelter beneath the bench and dashed into the river, their only retreat.  In cloudy weather, unlike the mosquito, the black fly disappears, only  flying when the sun shines. The bite of the black fly is often severe,  the creature leaving a large clot of blood to mark the scene of its  surgical triumphs. Prof. E. T. Cox, State Geologist of Indiana, has sent  us specimens of a much larger fly, which Baron Osten Sacken refers to  this genus, which is called on the prairies, where it is said to bite  horses to death,"]]]
