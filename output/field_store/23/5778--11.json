It is his indeed pre-eminently to dwell  in the house of his God, to be hid away from the world and its many  allurements; but as every great blessing brings with it a great  responsibility, so the responsibility of the minister of Christ is  very great, and if he turn from the commandment delivered to him, his  condemnation is fearful. I should be much obliged to you, Meredith,  if you would read me these verses.\"    Meredith took the open Bible from Mr. Wilkinson's hand, and read aloud  the first ten verses of the 34th of Ezekiel.    \"In this holy word, which must be the standard for all our conduct,  we do not find that the Almighty looks upon this office as a light  thing. In the thirty-third chapter there is so solemn a warning to  the careless watchman, that I wonder any one who does not steadfastly  intend to give himself to his sacred duties, can read it and not  tremble. 'If the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,  and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take away any  person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but HIS  BLOOD WILL I REQUIRE AT THE WATCHMAN'S HAND. So thou, O son of man,  I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou  shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say  unto the wicked, Oh wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost  not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die  in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.' This is  the second solemn warning to the same purport given to Ezekiel; for,  in the third chapter, we find the same thing; and these are awful  truths engraved in God's everlasting word, by which we are to be  judged at the last day. You must excuse me,\" continued Mr. Wilkinson,  and his eyes glistened with emotion; \"but I am a watchman, and I must  warn you of the fearful sin you are contemplating.\"    Meredith was silent. He was impressed with the earnestness displayed by  Mr. Wilkinson, and the solemn truths he had brought before him--truths  it would be well if all those who are looking forward to entering the  sacred ministry would seriously and prayerfully consider.    The tea bell ringing at this moment, the conversation was necessarily  concluded; but that evening after prayers, Mr. Wilkinson put into  Meredith's hand a piece of paper, on which were written the following  references: Num. xvi. 9; Isaiah lii. 7, 8; lxii. 6, 7; Jer. xxiii. 1-4;  Ezek. iii. 17-21; xxxiii. 1-9; xxxiv. 1-10; John xxi. 15-17;  1 Cor. ix. 16, 17, 19; and both the Epistles to Timothy; and underneath  the references was the Apostle's injunction, \"Meditate upon these things;  give thyself wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear unto all.\"    When Louis was fairly in bed that night, he was called on for a story.    \"Tell us the end of the princess Rosetta, Louis,\" cried Frank;  \"I want to know how the fair animal got out of her watery bedroom,  and whether the green dog ever got his nose nipped by the oysters  he was so fond of snapping up.\"    \"Yes, Rosetta!\" cried several voices. \"Did she ever get to the king  of the peacocks, Louis?\"    \"No, no,\" cried Reginald; \"it is not fit for Sunday.\"    \"I am sure we have been doing heaps of good things to-day,\"  replied Frank, lightly; \"come, Louis.\"    \"I must not,\" said Louis, gently. \"I do not like telling stories at  night at all, because I think we ought not to fill our heads with such  things when we are going to sleep; but I must not tell you Rosetta  to-night, Frank.\"    \"Get along,\" said Frank, contemptuously; \"you are not worth the snap  of a finger. All you are ever worth is to tell stories, and now you  must needs set up for a good, pious boy--you, forsooth of all others!\"    \"Indeed, Frank, you will not understand me.\"    \"If you dare to say any more to Louis,\" cried Reginald, \"I'll make you--\"    Louis' hand was upon Reginald's mouth.    Frank replied, tauntingly, \"Ay, finish your work this time, that's  right. Come boys, never mind, I'll tell you a wonderful tale.\"    \"I think we'd better not have one to-night,\" said one; \"perhaps  Mortimer's right.\"    \"Don't have one, don't!\" said Louis, starting up; \"do not let us  forget that all this day is God's day, and that we must not even  speak our own words.\"    \"None of your cant,\" cried one.    \"Well, I propose that we go to sleep, and then we shan't hear what  he says,\" said Meredith. \"They talk of his not having pluck enough  to speak, but he can do it when he pleases,\" he remarked in a low  tone to his next companion, Frank Digby, who rejoined,    \"More shame for him, the little hypocrite. I like real religious  people, but I can't bear cant.\"    What Frank's idea of real religion was, may be rather a difficult  matter to settle. Probably it was an obscure idea to himself,--an  idea of certain sentiment and no vitality.          CHAPTER VII.      The next Saturday afternoon proving unusually fine, the community at  Ashfield House sallied forth to enjoy their half-holiday on the downs.  A few of the seniors had received permission to pay a visit to Bristol,  and not a small party was arranged for a good game of cricket. Among  the latter was Reginald Mortimer, whose strong arm and swift foot were  deemed almost indispensable on such occasions. As he rushed out of the  playground gates, bat in hand, accompanied by Meredith, he overtook his  brother, who had discovered a poem unknown to him in _Coleridge's Ancient  Mariner_, and was anticipating a pleasant mental feast in its perusal.    \"Louis, you lazy fellow,\" cried Reginald, good-temperedly, \"you shan't  read this fine afternoon--come, join us.\"    \"I don't play cricket, I have not learned,\" replied Louis.    \"And you never will,\" rejoined Reginald, \"if you don't make a beginning:  I'll teach you--now put away that stupid book.\"    \"_Stupid!_\" said Louis. \"It's Coleridge, that mamma promised to read  to us.\"    \"I hate poetry,\" exclaimed Reginald; \"I wonder how anybody can read such  stuff. Give me the book, Louis, and come along.\"    \"No, thank you, I'd rather not.\"    \"What a donkey you are!\" said Meredith: \"why don't you learn?\"    \"Perhaps my reputation may be the safer for not divulging my reasons,\"  said Louis, archly: \"it is sufficient for present purposes that I had  rather not.\"    \"_Rather not_--_rather not_,\" echoed Meredith: \"like one of your  sensible reasons.\"    \"He has refused to give them, so you cannot call that his reason,  Meredith,\" remarked Reginald; \"but let us be off, as Louis won't come.\"    Away they ran, and after looking at them for a minute, Louis turned  off his own way, but it was destined that he should not read the  _Ancient Mariner_ that day, for he was presently interrupted by  little Alfred Hamilton, who pounced upon him full of joy.    \"Louis,\" he cried, \"I am so glad to speak to you! I don't know how  it is that I have not been able to speak to you lately: I half thought  Edward did not like it, but he asked me to-day why I did not come to  you now.\"    \"Did he?\" exclaimed Louis, with joyful surprise; \"I am very glad you  are come. I think we shall have a beautiful walk.\"    \"I can't think how it is, Louis, that everybody is either so grave or  rude when I speak of you. What is the matter?\"    \"A mistake; and a sad one for me,\" said Louis, gravely. \"But don't say  any thing about it, Alfred; they think I have been doing something very  wrong; but all will come out some day.\"    \"I hope so,\" replied little Alfred; \"I cannot think what you can have  done wrong, Louis, you always seem so good.\"    The child looked wistfully up in Louis' face as he spoke, and seemed  to wait some explanation.    \"That is because you do not know much about me, Alfred,\" replied Louis;  \"but in this one case I have not done wrong, I assure you.\"    Alfred asked no more questions, though he looked more than once in the  now sorrowful young face by him, as they sauntered along the wide downs.    \"Here come Edward and Mr. Trevannion,\" said Alfred, turning round;  \"and there is Frank Digby, and Mr. Ferrers, too. I think Edward is  going to Bristol this afternoon.\"    This intimation of the august approach of his majesty and court was  hardly given when the young gentlemen passed Louis. Hamilton, with  Trevannion, as usual, leaning on his arm, and Frank Digby walking  backwards before them, vainly endeavoring to support a failing  argument with a flood of nonsense, a common custom with this young  gentleman; and, by the way, we might recommend it as remarkably  convenient at such times, to prevent the pain of a total discomfiture,  it being more pleasant to slip quietly and unseen from your pedestal  to some perfectly remote topic, than to allow yourself to be hurled  roughly therefrom by the rude hand of a more sound and successful  disputant.    \"Enough, enough, Frank!\" exclaimed Hamilton, laughing. \"I see through  your flimsy veil. We won't say any more: you either argue in a circle,  or try to blind us.\"    Louis looked up as Hamilton passed, in hopes that that magnate might  give him a favorable glance, in which he was not mistaken, for Edward  the Great had been watching him from some distance, and was perfectly  aware of his near approach to him.    He certainly did not seem displeased, though the grave countenance bore  no marks of particular satisfaction at the rencontre. He spoke carelessly  to his brother, and then, addressing Louis, said, \"You must look after  him, Louis, if you wish for his company; if not, dismiss him at once.\"    \"I do wish for him,\" said Louis, with a bright look of gratitude;  \"I promise to take care of him. Mr. Hamilton, I am getting up in my  class--I am fifth now.\"    The latter communication was made doubtfully, in a tone indicating  mixed pleasure and timidity.    \"I am glad to hear it,\" was Hamilton's laconic reply. He did not quicken  his pace. \"What have you there?\" he asked, noticing his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#13)"],[1," delicate wild flowers. The beauty  of these patches of gleaming color is enhanced by contrast with the  forbidding and rugged character of the surroundings; but in a very short  time these blossoms disappear from the arid and parched desert that they  have temporarily beautified. These beds of bloom are not seen in the  immediate vicinity of the present villages, but are unexpectedly met  with in portions of the neighboring mesas and canyons.    After crossing the 6 or 7 miles of comparatively level country that  intervenes between the mouth of Keam's Canyon and the first of the  occupied mesas, the toilsome ascent begins; at first through slopes and  dunes and then over masses of broken talus, as the summit of the mesa is  gradually approached. Near the top the road is flanked on one side by a  very abrupt descent of broken slopes, and on the other by a precipitous  rocky wall that rises 30 or 40 feet above. The road reaches the brink of  the promontory by a sharp rise at a point close to the village of Hano.      METHODS OF SURVEY.    Before entering upon a description of the villages and ruins, a few  words as to the preparation of the plans accompanying this paper will  not be amiss. The methods pursued in making the surveys of the inhabited  pueblos were essentially the same throughout. The outer wall of each  separate cluster was run with a compass and a tape measure, the lines  being closed and checked upon the corner from which the beginning was  made, so that the plan of each group stands alone, and no accumulation  of error is possible. The stretched tapeline afforded a basis for  estimating any deviations from a straight line which the wall presented,  and as each sight was plotted on the spot these deviations are all  recorded on the plan, and afford an indication of the degree of accuracy  with which the building was carried out. Upon the basis thus obtained,  the outlines of the second stories were drawn by the aid of measurements  from the numerous jogs and angles; the same process being repeated for  each of the succeeding stories. The plan at this stage recorded all the  stories in outline. The various houses and clusters were connected by  compass sights and by measurements. A tracing of the outline plan was  then made, on which the stories were distinguished by lines of different  colors, and upon this tracing were recorded all the vertical  measurements. These were generally taken at every corner, although in a  long wall it was customary to make additional measurements at  intervening points.      [Illustration: Plate XVII. View of Hano.]    Upon the original outline were then drawn all such details as coping  stones, chimneys, trapdoors, etc., the tapeline being used where  necessary to establish positions. The forms of the chimneys as well as  their position and size were also indicated on this drawing, which was  finally tinted to distinguish the different terraces. Upon this colored  sheet were located all openings. These were numbered, and at the same  time described in a notebook, in which were also recorded the necessary  vertical measurements, such as their height and elevation above the  ground. In the same notebook the openings were also fully described. The  ladders were located upon the same sheet, and were consecutively  lettered and described in the notebook. This description furnishes a  record of the ladder, its projection above the coping, if any, the  difference in the length of its poles, the character of the tiepiece,  etc. Altogether these notebooks furnish a mass of statistical data which  has been of great service in the elaboration of this report and in the  preparation of models. Finally, a level was carried over the whole  village, and the height of each corner and jog above an assumed base was  determined. A reduced tracing was then made of the plan as a basis for  sketching in such details of topography, etc., as it was thought  advisable to preserve.    These plans were primarily intended to be used in the construction of  large scale models, and consequently recorded an amount of information  that could not be reproduced upon the published drawings without causing  great confusion.    The methods followed in surveying the ruins underwent some changes from  time to time as the work progressed. In the earlier work the lines of  the walls, so far as they could be determined, were run with a compass  and tapeline and gone over with a level. Later it was found more  convenient to select a number of stations and connect them by  cross-sights and measurements. These points were then platted, and the  walls and lines of débris were carefully drawn in over the framework of  lines thus obtained, additional measurements being taken when necessary.  The heights of standing walls were measured from both sides, and  openings were located on the plan and described in a notebook, as was  done in the survey of the inhabited villages. The entire site was then  leveled, and from the data obtained contour lines were drawn with a  5-foot interval. Irregularities in the directions of walls were noted.  In the later plans of ruins a scale of symbols, seven in number, were  employed to indicate the amount and distribution of the débris. The  plans, as published, indicate the relative amounts of débris as seen  upon the ground. Probable lines of wall are shown on the plan by dotted  lines drawn through the dots which indicate débris. With this exception,  the plans show the ruins as they actually are. Standing walls, as a  rule, are drawn in solid black; their heights appear on the field  sheets, but could not be shown upon the published plans without  confusing the drawing. The contour lines represent an interval of 5  feet; the few cases in which the secondary or negative contours are used  will not produce confusion, as their altitude is always given in  figures.      PLANS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF RUINS.    The ruins described in this chapter comprise but a few of those found  within the province of Tusayan. These were surveyed and recorded on  account of their close traditional connection with the present villages,  and for the sake of the light that they might throw upon the relation of  the modern pueblos to the innumerable stone buildings of unknown date so  widely distributed over the southwestern plateau country. Such  traditional connection with the present peoples could probably be  established for many more of the ruins of this country by investigations  similar to those conducted by Mr. Stephen in the Tusayan group; but this  phase of the subject was not included in our work. In the search for  purely architectural evidence among these ruins it must be confessed  that the data have proved disappointingly meager. No trace of the  numerous constructive details that interest the student of pueblo  architecture in the modern villages can be seen in the low mounds of  broken down masonry that remain in most of the ancient villages of  Tusayan. But little masonry remains standing in even the best preserved  of these ruins, and villages known to have been occupied within two  centuries are not distinguishable from the remains to which distinct  tradition (save that they were in the same condition when the first  people of the narrators' gens came to this region) no longer clings.  Though but little architectural information is to be derived from these  ruins beyond such as is conveyed by the condition and character of the  masonry and the general distribution of the plan, the plans and relation  to the topography are recorded as forming, in connection with the  traditions, a more complete account than can perhaps be obtained later.    In our study of architectural details, when a comparison is suggested  between the practice at Tusayan and that of the ancient builders, our  illustrations for the latter must often be drawn from other portions of  the builders' territory where better preserved remains furnish the  necessary data.    WALPI RUINS.    In the case of the pueblo of Walpi, a portion of whose people seem to  have been the first comers in this region, a number of changes of sites  have taken place, at least one of which has occurred within the historic  period. Of the various sites occupied one is pointed out north of the  gap on the first mesa. At the present time this site is only a low mound  of sand-covered débris with no standing fragment of wall visible. The  present condition of this early Walpi is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the  absence of foundation walls or other definite lines, the character of  the site is expressed by the contour lines that define its relief.  Another of the sites occupied by the Walpi is said to have been in the  open valley separating the first from the second mesa, but here no trace  of the remains of a stone village has been discovered. This traditional  location is referred to by Mr. Stephen in his account of Walpi. The last  site occupied previous to the present one on the mesa summit was on a  lower bench of the first mesa promontory at its southern extremity. Here  the houses are said to have been distributed over quite a large area,  and occasional fragments of masonry are still seen at widely separated  points; but the ground plan can not now be traced. This was the site of  a Spanish mission, and some of the Tusayan point out the position  formerly occupied by mission buildings, but no architectural evidence of  such structures is visible. It seems to be fairly certain, however, that  this was the site of Walpi at a date well within the historic period,  although now literally there is not one stone upon another. The  destruction in this instance has probably been more than usually  complete on account of the close proximity of the succeeding pueblo,  making the older remains a very convenient stone quarry for the  construction of the houses on the mesa summit. Of the three abandoned  sites of Walpi referred to, not one furnishes"]]]
