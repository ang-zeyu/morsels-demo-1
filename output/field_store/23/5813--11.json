The schoolmaster  serves mass, sings in the choir, rings the vesper bell, arranges the  seats, renews the flowers before the sacred heart, furbishes the altar  candlesticks, dusts the tabernacle, folds the copes and the chasubles,  counts and keeps in order the linen of the sacristy, puts oil in the  lamps, beats the cushion of the confessional, sweeps out the church,  and sometimes the rectory; the remainder of his time, on condition that  he does not pronounce either of those three words of the devil,  Country, Republic, Liberty, he may employ, if he thinks proper, in  teaching little children to say their A, B, C.    M. Bonaparte strikes at instruction at the same moment above and below:  below, to please the priests, above, to please the bishops. At the same  time that he is trying to close the village school, he mutilates the  College de France. He overturns with one blow the professors' chairs of  Quinet and of Michelet. One fine morning, he declares, by decree, Greek  and Latin to be under suspicion, and, so far as he can, forbids all  intercourse with the ancient poets and historians of Athens and of  Rome, scenting in AEschylus and in Tacitus a vague odour of demagogy.  With a stroke of the pen, for instance, he exempts all medical men from  literary qualification, which causes Doctor Serres to say: \"_We are  dispensed, by decree, from knowing how to read and write._\"    New taxes, sumptuary taxes, vestiary taxes; _nemo audeat comedere  praeter duo fercula cum potagio_; tax on the living, tax on the  dead, tax on successions, tax on carriages, tax on paper. \"Bravo!\"  shouts the beadle party, \"fewer books; tax upon dogs, the collars will  pay; tax upon senators, the armorial bearings will pay.\"--\"All this  will make me popular!\" says M. Bonaparte, rubbing his hands. \"He is the  socialist Emperor,\" vociferate the trusty partisans of the faubourgs.  \"He is the Catholic Emperor,\" murmur the devout in the sacristies. How  happy he would be if he could pass in the latter for Constantine, and  in the former for Babeuf! Watchwords are repeated, adhesion is  declared, enthusiasm spreads from one to another, the Ecole Militaire  draws his cypher with bayonets and pistol-barrels, Abbe Gaume and  Cardinal Gousset applaud, his bust is crowned with flowers in the  market, Nanterre dedicates rosebushes to him, social order is certainly  saved, property, family, and religion breathe again, and the police  erect a statue to him.    Of bronze?    Fie! that may do for the uncle.    Of marble! _Tu es Pietri et super hanc pietram aedificabo effigiem  meam._[1]          [1] We read in the Bonapartist correspondence:--\"The committee        appointed by the clerks of the prefecture of police, considers        that bronze is not worthy to represent the image of the Prince;        it will therefore be executed in marble; and it will be placed on        a marble pedestal. The following inscription will be cut in the        costly and superb stone: 'Souvenir of the oath of fidelity to the        Prince-President, taken by the clerks of the prefecture of        police, the 29th of May, 1862, before M. Pietri, Prefect of        Police.'          \"The subscriptions of the clerks, whose zeal it was necessary to        moderate, will be apportioned as follows:--Chief of division        10fr., chief of a bureau 6fr., clerks at a salary of 1,800fr.,        3fr.; at 1,500fr., 2fr. 50c.; and finally, at 1,200fr., 2fr. It        is calculated that this subscription will amount to upwards of        6,000 francs.\"    That which he attacks, that which he persecutes, that which they all  persecute with him, upon which they pounce, which they wish to crush,  to burn, to suppress, to destroy, to annihilate, is it this poor  obscure man who is called primary instructor? Is it this sheet of paper  that is called a journal? Is it this bundle of sheets which is called a  book? Is it this machine of wood and iron which is called a press? No,  it is thou, thought, it is thou, human reason, it is thou, nineteenth  century, it is thou, Providence, it is thou, God!    We who combat them are \"the eternal enemies of order.\" We are--for they  can as yet find nothing but this worn-out word--we are demagogues.    In the language of the Duke of Alva, to believe in the sacredness of  the human conscience, to resist the Inquisition, to brave the state for  one's faith, to draw the sword for one's country, to defend one's  worship, one's city, one's home, one's house, one's family, and one's  God, was called _vagabondism_; in the language of Louis Bonaparte, to  struggle for freedom, for justice, for the right, to fight in the cause  of progress, of civilisation, of France, of mankind, to wish for the  abolition of war, and of the penalty of death, to take _au serieux_ the  fraternity of men, to believe in a plighted oath, to take up arms for  the constitution of one's country, to defend the laws,--this is called  _demagogy_.    The man is a demagogue in the nineteenth century, who in the sixteenth  would have been a vagabond.    This much being granted, that the dictionary of the Academy no longer  exists, that it is night at noonday, that a cat is no longer called  cat, and that Baroche is no longer called a knave; that justice is a  chimera, that history is a dream, that the Prince of Orange was a  vagabond, and the Duke of Alva a just man; that Louis Bonaparte is  identical with Napoleon the Great, that they who have violated the  Constitution are saviours, and that they who defended it are  brigands,--in a word that human probity is dead: very good! in that  case I admire this government It works well. It is a model of its  species. It compresses, it represses, it oppresses, it imprisons, it  exiles, it shoots down with grape-shot, it exterminates, and it even  \"pardons!\" It exercises authority with cannon-balls, and clemency with  the flat of the sabre.    \"At your pleasure,\" repeat some worthy incorrigibles of the former  party of order, \"be indignant, rail, stigmatize, disavow,--'tis all the  same to us; long live stability! All these things put together  constitute, after all, a stable government.\"    Stable! We have already expressed ourselves on the subject of this  stability.    Stability! I admire such stability. If it rained newspapers in France  for two days only, on the morning of the third nobody would know what  had become of M. Louis Bonaparte.    No matter; this man is a burden upon the whole age, he disfigures the  nineteenth century, and there will be in this century, perhaps, two or  three years upon which it will be recognised, by some shameful mark or  other, that Louis Bonaparte sat down upon them.    This person, we grieve to say it, is now the question that occupies all  mankind.    At certain epochs in history, the whole human race, from all points of  the earth, fix their eyes upon some mysterious spot whence it seems  that universal destiny is about to issue. There have been hours when  the world has looked towards the Vatican: Gregory VII and Leo X  occupied the pontifical throne; other hours, when it has contemplated  the Louvre; Philip Augustus, Louis IX, Francois I, and Henri IV were  there; the Escorial, Saint-Just: Charles V dreamed there; Windsor:  Elizabeth the Great reigned there; Versailles: Louis XIV shone there  surrounded by stars; the Kremlin: one caught a glimpse there of Peter  the Great; Potsdam: Frederick II was closeted there with Voltaire. At  present, history, bow thy head, the whole universe is looking at the  Elysee!    That species of bastard door, guarded by two sentry-boxes painted on  canvas, at the extremity of Faubourg Saint-Honore, that is the spot  towards which the eyes of the civilized world are now turned with a  sort of profound anxiety! Ah! what sort of place is that, whence no  idea has issued that has not been a plot, no action that has not been a  crime? What sort of place is that wherein reside all kinds of cynicism  and all kinds of hypocrisy? What sort of place is that where bishops  elbow Jeanne Poisson on the staircase, and, as a hundred years ago, bow  to the ground before her; where Samuel Bernard laughs in a corner with  Laubardemont; which Escobar enters, arm-in-arm with Guzman d'Alfarache;  where (frightful rumour), in a thicket in the garden, they despatch, it  is said, with the bayonet men whom they dare not bring to trial; where  one hears a man say to a woman who is weeping and interceding: \"I  overlook your love-affairs, you must overlook my hatreds!\" What sort of  place is that where the orgies of 1852 intrude upon and dishonour the  mourning of 1815! where Caesarion, with his arms crossed, or his hands  behind his back, walks under those very trees, and in those very  avenues still haunted by the indignant phantom of Caesar?    That place is the blot upon Paris; that place is the pollution of the  age; that door, whence issue all sorts of joyous sounds, flourishes of  trumpets, music, laughter, and the jingling of glasses; that door,  saluted during the day by the passing battalions; illuminated at night;  thrown wide open with insolent confidence,--is a sort of public insult  always present. There is the centre of the world's shame.    Alas! of what is France thinking? Of a surety, we must awake this  slumbering nation, we must take it by the arm, we must shake it, we  must speak to it; we must scour the fields, enter the villages, go into  the barracks, speak to the soldier who no longer knows what he is  doing, speak to the labourer who has in his cabin an engraving of the  Emperor, and who, for that reason, votes for everything they ask; we  must remove the radiant phantom that dazzles their eyes; this whole  situation is nothing but a huge and deadly joke. We must expose this  joke, probe it to the bottom, disabuse the people,--the country people  above all,--excite them, agitate them, stir them up, show them the  empty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20587"],[0,"Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-1965 (#13)"],[1,"blem.\"[2-23]  And this situation could not be avoided, since it would take several  years to train black mechanics; meanwhile black pilots would have to  work with white ground crews, often at distant bases outside their  regular chain of command. The Air Corps faced strong opposition    (p. 028)  when both the civil rights advocates and the rest of the Army attacked  this exclusion. The civil rights organizations wanted a place for  Negroes in the glamorous Air Corps, but even more to the point the  other arms and services wanted this large branch of the Army to absorb  its fair share of black recruits, thus relieving the rest of a  disproportionate burden.                       [Footnote 2-22: The Army's air arm was reorganized                     several times. Designated as the Army Air Corps in                     1926 (the successor to the historic Army Air                     Service), it became the Army Air Forces in the                     summer of 1941. This designation lasted until a                     separate U.S. Air Force was created in 1947.                     Organizationally, the Army was divided in March                     1942 into three equal parts: the Army Ground                     Forces, the Army Service Forces (originally                     Services of Supply), and the Army Air Forces. This                     division was administrative. Each soldier continued                     to be assigned to a branch of the Army, for                     example, Infantry, Artillery, or Air Corps, a title                     retained as the name of an Army branch.]                       [Footnote 2-23: Memo, CofAC for G-3, 31 May 40, sub:                     Employment of Negro Personnel in Air Corps Units,                     G-3/6541-Gen-527.]    [Illustration: LABOR BATTALION TROOPS IN THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, MAY  1943. _Stevedores pause for a hot meal at Massacre Bay._]    [Illustration: SERGEANT ADDRESSING THE LINE. _Aviation squadron  standing inspection, 1943._]    When the War Department supported these demands the Army Air Forces  capitulated. Its 1941 mobilization plans provided for the formation of  nine separate black aviation squadrons which would perform the  miscellaneous tasks associated with the upkeep of airfields. During  the next year the Chief of Staff set the allotment of black recruits  for the air arm at a rate that brought over 77,500 Negroes into the  Air Corps by 1943. On 16 January 1941 Under Secretary Patterson  announced the formation of a black pursuit squadron, but the Army Air  Forces, bowing to the opposition typified by General Arnold's comments  of the previous year, trained the black pilots in separate facilities  at Tuskegee, Alabama, where the Army tried to duplicate the expensive  training center established for white officers at Maxwell Field, just  forty miles away.[2-24] Black pilots were at first trained exclusively  for pursuit flying, a very difficult kind of combat for which a Negro  had to qualify both physically and technically or else, in Judge   (p. 029)  Hastie's words, \"not fly at all.\"[2-25] The 99th Fighter Squadron was  organized at Tuskegee in 1941 and sent to the Mediterranean theater in  April 1943. By then the all-black 332d Fighter Group with three  additional fighter squadrons had been organized, and in 1944 it too  was deployed to the Mediterranean.                       [Footnote 2-24: USAF Oral History Program, Interv                     with Maj Gen Noel F Parrish (USAF, Ret.), 30 Mar                     73.]                       [Footnote 2-25: William H. Hastie, _On Clipped Wings:                     The Story of Jim Crow in the Army Air Corps_ (New                     York: NAACP, 1943). Based on War Department                     documents and statistics, this famous pamphlet was                     essentially an attack on the Army Air Corps. For a                     more comprehensive account of the Negro and the                     Army Air Forces, see Osur, _Blacks in the Army Air                     Forces During World War II_.]    [Illustration: PILOTS OF THE 332D FIGHTER GROUP BEING BRIEFED _for  combat mission in Italy_.]    These squadrons could use only a limited number of pilots, far fewer  than those black cadets qualified for such training. All applicants in  excess of requirements were placed on an indefinite waiting list where  many became overage or were requisitioned for other military and  civilian duties. Yet when the Army Air Forces finally decided to  organize a black bomber unit, the 477th Bombardment Group, in late  1943, it encountered a scarcity of black pilots and crewmen. Because  of the lack of technical and educational opportunities for Negroes in  America, fewer blacks than whites were included in the manpower pool,  and Tuskegee, already overburdened with its manifold training  functions and lacking the means to train bomber crews, was unable to  fill the training gap. Sending black cadets to white training schools  was one obvious solution; the Army Air Forces chose instead to  postpone the operational date of the 477th until its pilots could be  trained at Tuskegee. In the end, the 477th was not declared        (p. 030)  operational until after the war. Even then some compromise with the  Army Air Forces' segregation principles was necessary, since Tuskegee  could not accommodate B-25 pilot transition and navigator-bombardier  training. In 1944 black officers were therefore temporarily assigned  to formerly all-white schools for such training. Tuskegee's position  as the sole and separate training center for black pilots remained  inviolate until its closing in 1946, however, and its graduates, the  \"Tuskegee Airmen,\" continued to serve as a powerful symbol of armed  forces segregation.[2-26]                       [Footnote 2-26: For a detailed discussion of the                     black training program, see Osur, _Blacks in the                     Army Air Forces During World War II_, ch. III; Lee,                     _Employment of Negro Troops_, pp. 461-66; Charles                     E. Francis, _The Tuskegee Airmen: The Story of the                     Negro in the U.S. Air Force_ (Boston Bruce                     Humphries, 1955).]    Training for black officer candidates other than flyers, like that of  most officer candidates throughout the Army, was integrated. At first  the possibility of integrated training seemed unlikely, for even  though Assistant Secretary of War for Air Robert A. Lovett had assured  Hastie that officer candidate training would be integrated, the  Technical Training Command announced plans in 1942 for a segregated  facility. Although the plans were quickly canceled the command's  announcement was the immediate cause for Hastie's resignation from the  War Department. The Air staff assured the Assistant Secretary of War  in January of 1943 that qualified Negroes were being sent to officer  candidate schools and to training courses \"throughout the school  system of the Technical Training Command.\"[2-27] In fact, Negroes did  attend the Air Forces' officer candidate school at Miami Beach,  although not in great numbers. In spite of their integrated training,  however, most of these black officers were assigned to the  predominantly black units at Tuskegee and Godman fields.                       [Footnote 2-27: Memo, CofAS for ASW, 12 Jan 43, ASW                     291.2.]    The Army Air Forces found it easier to absorb the thousands of black  enlisted men than to handle the black flying squadrons. For the  enlisted men it created a series of units with vaguely defined duties,  usually common labor jobs operating for the most part under a bulk  allotment system that allowed the Air Forces to absorb great numbers  of new men. Through 1943 hundreds of these aviation training  squadrons, quartermaster truck companies, and engineer aviation and  air base security battalions were added to the Air Forces'  organization tables. Practically every American air base in the world  had its contingent of black troops performing the service duties  connected with air operations.    The Air Corps, like the Armor and the Artillery branches, was able to  form separate squadrons or battalions for black troops, but the  Infantry and Cavalry found it difficult to organize the growing number  of separate black battalions and regiments. The creation of black  divisions was the obvious solution, although this arrangement would  run counter to current practice, which was based in part on the Army's  experience with the 92d Division in World War I. Convinced of the poor  performance of that unit in 1918, the War Department had decided in  the 1920's not to form any more black divisions. The regiment would  serve as the basic black unit, and from time to time these regiments  would be employed as organic elements of divisions whose other  regiments and units would be white. In keeping with this decision, the  black 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments were combined in October      (p. 031)  1940 with white regiments to form the 2d Cavalry Division.    Before World War II most black leaders had agreed with the Army's  opposition to all-black divisions, but for different reasons. They  considered that such divisions only served to strengthen the  segregation pattern they so opposed. In the early weeks of the war a  conference of black editors, including Walter White, pressed for the  creation of an experimental integrated division of volunteers. White  argued that such a unit would lift black morale, \"have a tremendous  psychological effect upon white America,\" and refute the enemy's  charge that \"the United States talks about democracy but practices  racial discrimination and segregation.\"[2-28] The NAACP organized a  popular movement in support of the idea, which was endorsed by many  important individuals and organizations.[2-29] Yet this experiment was  unacceptable to the Army."]]]
