We find from table 7 that the absolute  magnitude of the parallax stars varies between -4 and +11, the extreme  stars being of type M. The absolutely brightest stars have a rather  great distance from us and their absolute magnitude is badly determined.  The brightest star in the table is Antares with _M_ = -4.6, which value  is based on the parallax 0\".014 found by ADAMS. So small a parallax  value is of little reliability when it is directly computed from annual  parallax observations, but is more trustworthy when derived with the  spectroscopic method of ADAMS. It is probable from a discussion of the  _B_-stars, to which we return in a later chapter, that the absolutely  brightest stars have a magnitude of the order -5m or -6m. If the  parallaxes smaller than 0\".01 were taken into account we should find that  Canopus would represent the absolutely brightest star, having _M_ =  -8.17, and next to it we should find RIGEL, having _M_ = -6.97, but both  these values are based on an annual parallax equal to 0\".007, which is  too small to allow of an estimation of the real value of the absolute  magnitude.    If on the contrary the _absolutely faintest_ stars be considered, the  parallax stars give more trustworthy results. Here we have only to do  with near stars for which the annual parallax is well determined. In  table 8 I give a list of those parallax stars that have an absolute  magnitude greater than 9m.    There are in all 19 such stars. The faintest of all known stars is  INNES' star \"Proxima Centauri\" with _M_ = 13.9. The third star is  BARNARD's star with _M_ = 11.7, both being, together with [alpha]  Centauri, also the nearest of all known stars. The mean distance of all  the faint stars is 1.0 sir.    There is no reason to believe that the limit of the absolute magnitude  of the faint stars is found from these faint parallax stars:--Certainly  there are many stars in space with _M_ > 13m and the mean value of _M_,  for all stars in the Galaxy, is probably not far from the absolute value  of the faint parallax stars in this table. This problem will be  discussed in a later part of these lectures.

There, in front of the soda  fountain, were the bully of the Hall and his crony. They were drinking  soda and talking to a young girl who had served them.    \"Hullo, here they are!\" cried Sam, and came to a halt.    As they looked into the place they saw Tad Sobber reach over the counter  and catch the girl clerk by her curls. He held fast, grinning into her  face, while she tried to pull away from him.    \"The mean wretch!\" cried Dick. \"He tries to make himself as obnoxious as  he can to everybody he meets.\"    \"Oh, please let go!\" came in the girl's voice through the open doorway.  \"You hurt me!\"    \"Don't worry, I won't hurt you,\" replied Sobber, still grinning.    \"But I--I don't want my curls pulled,\" pleaded the frightened girl. \"Oh,  please let go, won't you?\"    \"I want you----\" began the bully, but did not finish, for at that moment  he felt Dick's hand on his ear. Then he received a yank that pained him  exceedingly.    \"Ouch!\" he yelled, and dropped his hold of the girl. \"Oh, my ear! Dick  Rover, what did you do that for?\"    \"I did it to make you behave yourself,\" answered Dick, sternly. \"Sobber,  I didn't really think you could be so mean,\" he went on.    \"I--I wasn't hurting the girl,\" grumbled the bully. \"And it's none of  your business anyway,\" he added, suddenly, in a blaze of passion.    \"After this, you leave her alone.\"    Tad Sobber glared at Dick for an instant. Then he raised his glass of  soda and attempted to dash it into Dick's face. But Sam saw the  movement, knocked up the bully's arm, and the soda went into Nick Pell's  ear.    \"Hi, stop!\" roared Nick Pell, as the soda trickled down his neck. \"What  did you do that for?\"    \"It was Sam Rover's fault,\" answered Sobber.    \"My brand new collar is spoilt!\"    \"Charge it to your crony,\" said Tom.    \"I'll fix you fellows!\" roared the bully, and raised the empty soda  glass over Dick's head. But now Tom rushed in and wrenched the glass  from Sobber's hand. In the meantime the girl behind the counter had  become more frightened than ever and she ran to the back of the store to  summon assistance.    It looked as if there might be a regular fight, but in a few seconds the  proprietor of the store appeared, armed with a mop stick he had picked  up. He happened to be the father of the girl, and she told him how Tad  Sobber had caught her by the hair.    \"See here,\" began the candy store keeper, and flourished his mop stick  at the bully. Then Sobber retreated from the establishment and Nick Pell  did likewise, and both started on a run up the street.    \"What do you cadets mean by coming in here and annoying my daughter?\"  demanded the storekeeper hotly. \"If you can't behave yourselves, you had  better keep away.\"    \"We didn't hurt your daughter,\" said Sam.    \"My brother here did what he could to save her from annoyance,\" said  Tom.    \"Oh, I know you cadets! You are all tarred with the same brush!\"  muttered the storekeeper. \"I want you to get out--and stay out!\"    \"Yes, but----\" began Dick.    \"No 'buts' about it, young man. I want you to get out.\"    \"Father, he made the other boy let go of my curls,\" explained the girl.  \"He caught the other boy by the ear.\"    \"That may be, Fanny, but these young bloods are all alike. I don't want  their trade. They must clear out, and stay away.\"    \"Come on, fellows,\" said Dick. \"We'll not stay if we are not wanted.\" He  turned again to the storekeeper. \"But I want you to remember one thing:  We had nothing to do with annoying your daughter.\"    \"Did they pay for the soda?\" asked the man suddenly.    \"No,\" replied the girl.    \"Then this crowd has got to pay,\" went on the storekeeper, unreasonably.  \"How much was it?\"    \"Ten cents.\"    \"We haven't bought anything and we'll not pay for anything,\" said Sam.    \"Not a cent shall I pay,\" put in Songbird.    \"Did vos a outrages!\" burst out Hans. \"Of you insult us some more I vos  call a bolicemans alretty!\" And he puffed up his chest indignantly.    \"Well, you get out, and be quick about it!\" cried the man, and raised  his stick. \"Don't let me catch any of you in here again either!\"    \"Don't worry,--we can spend our money elsewhere,\" said Tom.    \"Where we are treated decently,\" added Dick, and walked from the candy  store.    Once outside, the boys talked the situation over for all of ten minutes,  but without satisfaction. All were indignant over the way the  storekeeper had treated them, and Tom wanted to go back on the sly and  play a trick on him, but Dick demurred.    \"Let it go, Tom. He is a mean man, that's all.\"    \"Well, I am going to show folks how generous he is,\" answered Tom, with  a sudden grin. \"Wait here a few minutes,\" and he darted into a nearby  store where they sold stationery. When he came out he had a good-sized  sheet of paper in his hand and also several big red seals.    \"What's that?\" asked Sam.    \"It's a sign for the candy storekeeper's front window.\"    With caution Tom went back to the store. He saw that the proprietor was  in the rear parlor, dishing out ice-cream to several customers who had  come in. The girl was also at the back. Swiftly Tom stuck the sheet of  paper up under the show window, fastening it with the gummy seals. The  paper read as follows:    FREE BOUQUETS OF ROSES TO ALL YOUNG LADIES BUYING ICE-CREAM HERE TO-DAY.  COME IN!    \"Now let us watch for some fun,\" said Tom.    They had not long to wait. The steamboat had come in and a number of  passengers were walking up the street. Soon a party of three girls and a  young man espied the sign.    \"Oh, Clara,\" cried one of the girls. \"Free roses this time of year, just  think of it!\"    \"Come on right in,\" said the young man, and led the way into the store.  Then another young man came along with a girl and they also read the  sign and entered. Soon two old maids stopped and read the announcement.    \"I do love ice-cream, Angelina,\" said one. \"Let us go in and get  chocolate and get the bouquets, too.\" And they followed the crowd  inside.    The store had two side windows to it, which were opened a few inches  from the bottom for ventilation, and the cadets stole up to these  windows to listen to the talk. Everybody ordered cream and began to eat,  and then asked for the bouquets.    \"Bouquets?\" asked the storekeeper, mystified.    \"Why, yes,\" said the young man who had brought in the three girls.    \"If you don't mind, I'd like Jack roses,\" said one of the maidens.    \"And I like American Beauties,\" said another.    \"I don't care what kind I get so long as it is a big bunch,\" added the  third girl.    \"What are you talking about?\" demanded the storekeeper.    \"We are talking about the bouquets you are giving away,\" said the young  man. He had eaten nearly all of his cream and the girls had almost  finished.    \"I am giving away no bouquets.\"    \"Why, yes you are!\" cried the girls.    \"Of course!\" put in one of the old maids, suspiciously. \"And I want just  as good a bunch of roses as anybody.\"    \"So do I,\" added the second old maid.    \"Are you folks all crazy?\" demanded the storekeeper. \"I am not giving  away anything.\"    \"What!\" demanded the young man who had come in with one girl. \"Your sign  don't read that way. It says 'free bouquets of roses to all young ladies  buying ice-cream here to-day.' You've got to give this young lady her  bouquet or I won't pay for this cream!\"    \"Where is that sign?\" demanded the storekeeper, and when told rushed out  and tore the announcement down and into shreds. \"This is a--an outrage!  I didn't put the sign up!\"    After this there was a wordy war lasting several minutes. Nobody wanted  to pay for the cream eaten, and as he could not furnish the bouquets the  storekeeper could not collect. In a rage he chased the would-be  customers out and then started to look for the person who had played him  such a trick. But the cadets of Putnam Hall had withdrawn from that  vicinity and they took good care to keep out of sight.          CHAPTER XV    AN ASTONISHING GIFT      The steamboat had to take on considerable freight at Cedarville, so she  remained at the little dock for the best part of half an hour. During  that time the Rovers and their friends saw Tad Sobber and Nick Pell  walking around the village, but did not speak to them.    \"Hullo, here is something new,\" said Songbird, as they walked past the  stores. \"A dime museum!\"    \"Such a thing as that will never pay here,\" was Dick's comment. \"Not  enough people.\"    \"It is to remain only one week,\" said Sam, after reading the sign over  the door.    \"Wonder if they really have one hundred snakes in the collection?\" mused  Tom, also reading the sign. \"If so, there would be some fun if the bunch  broke loose.\"    \"Want to go in and look at the snakes?\" asked Songbird.    \"I ton't,\" answered Hans. \"Of I look at so many of dem nasty dings I  couldn't sleep for a month or sefen days, ain't it!\" And he shuddered.    While the boys were walking away they chanced to look back and saw Tad  Sobber and Nick Pell come from the \"museum,\" so called. The bully was  talking to a man connected with the show, a fellow who usually stood  outside, \"barking\" as it is called,--that is, asking folks to come up  and walk in and see the wonders inside.    \"Sobber must know that fellow,\" was Dick's comment, but thought no more  of this until long afterwards. A little later they saw the bully embark  on the steamboat, and Nick Pell started back for Putnam Hall alone.    The boys purchased the things they wanted and returned to the school.  They did not see Nick Pell until the following day, and then the latter  paid no attention to them. Sobber did not return to Putnam Hall for the  best part of a week. Then he appeared very thoughtful and he eyed all"]]]
