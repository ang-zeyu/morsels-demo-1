February 23, 1885.]    Yet we are right in never thinking of the Great Man first as a soldier,  he was so much besides. Washington's consummate intellectual trait was  sound judgment, only matched by the magnificent balance which subsisted  between his mental and his moral powers. \"George had always been a good  son,\" his mother said. Nature had endowed him with intense passions and  ambitions, but neither could blind him or swerve him one hair from the  line of rectitude as he saw it. And he made painful and unremitting  effort to see it and see it correctly. He was approachable, but repelled  familiarity, and whoever attempted this was met with a perfectly  withering look. He rarely laughed, and he was without humor, though he  wrote and conversed well. He had the integrity of Aristides. His account  with Congress while general shows scrupulousness to the uttermost  farthing. To subordinate, to foe, even to malicious plotters against  him, he was almost guiltily magnanimous. He loved popularity, yet, if  conscious that he was right, would face public murmuring with heart of  flint. Became the most famous man alive, idolized at home, named by  every tongue in Europe, praised by kings and great ministers, who  compared him with Caesar, Charlemagne, and Alfred the Great, his head  swam not, but with steadfast heart and mind he moved on in the simple  pursuit of his country's weal. \"In Washington's career,\" said Fisher  Ames, \"mankind perceived some change in their ideas of greatness; the  splendor of power, and even the name of conqueror had grown dim in their  eyes.\" Lord Erskine wrote him: \"You are the only being for whom I have  an awful reverence.\" \"Until time shall be no more,\" said Lord Brougham,  \"will a test of the progress which our race has made in Wisdom and  Virtue be derived from the veneration paid to the immortal name of  Washington.\" And Mr. Gladstone: \"If among all the pedestals supplied by  history for public characters of extraordinary nobility and purity I saw  one higher than all the rest, and if I were required at a moment's  notice to name the fittest occupant for it, my choice would light upon  WASHINGTON.\" [Footnote: See Winthrop's Oration for these and other  encomia.]        CHAPTER IX.    THE OLD CONFEDERATION    [1781]    The Revolutionary Congress was less a government than an exigency  committee. It had no authority save in tacit general consent. Need of an  express and permanent league was felt at an early date. Articles of  Confederation, framed by Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, were adopted by  Congress in November, 1777. They were then submitted to the State  Legislatures for ratification. By the spring of 1779 all the States but  Maryland had given their approval. Upon the accession of the latter, on  March 1, 1781, the articles went into effect at once.    The Confederation bound the States together into a \"firm league of  friendship\" for common defence and welfare, and this \"union\" was to be  \"perpetual.\"  Each State retained its \"sovereignty\" and \"independence,\"  as well as every power not \"expressly delegated\" to the central  Government. Inhabitants of each State were entitled to all the  privileges of citizens in the several States. Criminals fleeing from one  State to another were to be returned.    Congress was composed of delegates chosen annually, each State being  represented by not less than two or more than seven. Each State had but  one vote, whatever the number of its delegates.    Taxation and the regulation of commerce were reserved to the State  Governments. On the other hand, Congress alone could declare peace or  war, make treaties, coin money, establish a post-office, deal with  Indians outside of the States, direct the army, and appoint generals and  naval officers. Many other things affecting all the States alike,  Congress alone could do. It was to erect courts for trial of felonies  and piracies on the high seas, and appoint judges for the settlement of  disputes between the States. It was to make estimates for national  expenses, and request of each State its quota of revenue.    To amend the Articles, the votes of the entire thirteen States were  demanded. Important lesser measures--such as those regarding war or  peace, treaties, coinage, loans, appropriations--required the consent of  nine States. Upon other questions a majority was sufficient. A  committee, composed of one delegate from each State, was to sit during  the recess of Congress, having the general superintendence of national  affairs.    The faults of the Confederation were numerous and great. Three  outshadowed the rest: Congress could not enforce its will, could not  collect a revenue, could not regulate commerce.    Congress could not touch individuals; it must act through the State  Governments, and these it had no power to coerce. Five States, for  instance, passed laws which violated the treaty provision about payment  of British creditors; yet Congress could do nothing but remonstrate.  Hence its power to make treaties was almost a nullity. European nations  did not wish to treat with a Government that could not enforce its  promises.    Congress could make requisition upon the States for revenue, but had no  authority to collect a single penny. The States complied or not as they  chose. In October, 1781, Congress asked for $8,000,000; in January,  1783, it had received less than half a million. Lack of revenue made the  Government continually helpless and often contemptible.    Yet in spite of their looseness and other faults, the adoption of the  Articles of Confederation was a forward step in American public law.  Their greatest value was this: they helped to keep before the States the  thought of union, while at the same time, by their very inefficiency,  they proved the need of a stronger government to make union something  more than a thought. The years immediately after the war were an  extremely critical period. The colonies had indeed passed through the  Red Sea, but the wilderness still lay before them. The great danger  which had driven them into union being past, State pride and jealousy  broke out afresh. \"My State,\" not \"my country,\" was the foremost thought  in most minds. There was serious danger that each State would go its own  way, and firm union come, if at all, only after years of weakness and  disaster, if not of war. The unfriendly nations of Europe were eagerly  anticipating such result. At this juncture the Articles of  Confederation, framed during the war when union was felt to be  imperative, did invaluable service. They solemnly committed the States  to perpetual union. Their provisions for extradition of criminals and  for inter-State citizenship helped to break down the barriers between  State and State. Congress, by discharging its various duties on behalf  of all the States, kept steadily before the public mind the idea of a  national government, armed with at least a semblance of authority.      [Illustration: Coin.]  The Franklin Penny.  \"United States\" \"We Are One\"  \"Fugio\"  \"1787\"  \"Mind Your Business\"      [1783]    The war had cost about $150,000,000. In 1783 the debt was  $42,000,000--$8,000,000 owed in France and Holland, and the rest at  home. The States contributed in so niggardly a way that even the  interest could not be paid. Five millions were owing to the army. Deep  and ominous discontent spread among officers and men. An obscure  colonel, supposed to be the agent of more prominent men, wrote to  Washington, advocating a monarchy as the only salvation for the country,  and inviting him to become king. In the spring of 1783 an anonymous  address, of menacing tone, was circulated in the army, calling upon it  for measures to force its rights from an ungrateful country.    [1785]    That the army disbanded quietly at last, with only three months' pay, in  certificates depreciated nine-tenths, was due almost wholly to the  boundless influence of Washington. How powerless the Government would  have been to resist an uprising of the army, was shown by a humiliating  incident. In June, 1783, a handful of Pennsylvania troops, clamoring for  their pay, besieged the doors of Congress, and that august body had to  take refuge in precipitate flight.    The country suffered greatly for lack of uniform commercial laws. So  long as each State laid its own imposts, and goods free of duty in one  State might be practically excluded from another, Congress could  negotiate no valuable treaties of commerce abroad.    The chief immediate distress was from this wretchedness of our  commercial relations, whether foreign or between the States at home. If  our fathers would be independent, king and parliament were determined to  make them pay dearly for the privilege. Accordingly Great Britain laid  tariffs upon all our exports thither. What was much harder to bear, an  order of the king in council, July 2, 1783, utterly forbade American  ships to engage in that British West-Indian trade which had always been  a chief source of our wealth. The sole remedy for these abuses in  dealing with England at that time was retaliation, but Congress had no  authority to take retaliatory steps, while the separate States could not  or would not act sufficiently in harmony to do so. If one imposed  customs duties, another would open wide its ports, filling the markets  of the first with British goods by overland trade, so that the customs  law of the first availed nothing. If Pennsylvania and New York laid  tariffs on foreign commodities, New Jersey and Connecticut people, in  buying imported articles from Philadelphia or New York, were paying  taxes to those greater States. North Carolina was in the same manner a  forced tributary to South Carolina and Virginia, as were portions of  Connecticut and Massachusetts to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#13)"],[1,"than does the singing-voice. If the  tones in speech are steady in pitch, singing is possible in all  probability. If, on the contrary, the speaking-voice is croaky and  wavering, singing is difficult, if not impossible. As the object of the  study of vocal music in the public schools, in so far as it relates to  the treatment of the voice, is to develop good vocal habits, not bad  ones, it follows that if boys sing during the break it must be only upon  those tones which lie within their compass at any time, and that the  vocal organs must be used lightly, and without strain.    In nearly every upper grade room there will be a percentage of boys  whose voices are in a transition stage, some of whom can sing and others  of whom cannot. It requires judgment and tact to handle these voices,  but if boys have sung as they should up to this period, and have taken  pleasure in it, the mutual good understanding between them and their  teacher need not be disturbed. They are likely to do their best.    In this connection it should be said, that really it may be doubted if  the common practice of assigning all boys, whose voices show signs of  breaking, to the bass part, is right.    If boys have been kept upon the lower part, in all part singing and have  never used other than the thick chest voice, then, when the voice begins  to break up, it may be that they must sing bass or not sing at all. Boys  trained in this way have never used the soprano head register and so if  they sing alto, it will be with the thick chest voice of boyhood, which  will now be the upper tones of the developing man's voice.    Singing alto at the mutation period in _this_ manner, strains the vocal  bands beyond reason, and should not under any circumstances be allowed.  It must be understood then in what follows, that singing alto in this,  the chest voice, either before or during the break, is unqualifiedly  condemned.    But we will suppose now that boys have been permitted to sing only in  the head register, that they have been assigned to the upper part in  part singing, for notwithstanding that usage is to the contrary, this is  what should be done. As has already been suggested the voices of girls  change less, and at a younger age than do boys, and they begin to show  weight of tone and increased volume, at an age when boys are at their  best as sopranos. Girls at this period should sing the middle and lower  parts, but it must be said in passing that much of the music contained  in our text-books ranges too low in pitch for them, or any voice except  a low contralto or a tenor. They must not be permitted to use their  voices at full strength, and special care should be taken of those who  at this age show hoarseness. With girls as with boys, the change is  accompanied with periods of great relaxation of the vocal bands, and  during these periods the singing tone is either very light, or very  loud.    Returning to the subject of treatment of boys' voices during mutation,  and premising that they have sung only in the head voice during  childhood, the question arises whether they are not in many cases set to  singing bass prematurely. It is obvious that during this period the  voice is actually _broken_, divided in two. The lower notes are produced  in the chest or man's register, while more or less of the boy's voice  remains as upper tones. These tones, by the way, never are lost, they  remain as the falsetto or head voice of the man.    Now the vibratory action of the vocal ligaments is much larger for the  chest voice than for the head, or as we ordinarily call it, the  falsetto. There is then no question that during mutation a boy can  confine himself to the use of his old voice, or so much of it as is  available at any time with very little strain. The tone will be light,  in fact, during the active periods of laryngeal growth which  characterize mutation, there will perhaps be no voice at all, owing to  the congestion of the parts, but in the periods of rest separating the  periods of growth, the vocal bands will respond. The compass of the head  voice at this time varies largely, but it corresponds pretty closely to  that of the second soprano, in three part exercises, or from C to C. If  it is attempted to carry the voice down it changes to the chest register  unless used very lightly.    Without attempting then to lay down positive rules for treating a voice  which consists of fragments of voices, the above suggestions are made in  the hope that they may receive the consideration of teachers and  musicians.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE ALTO VOICE IN MALE CHOIRS.      The suggestions of the preceding chapters are addressed directly to  those who teach vocal music in public or private schools, but the  general principles and rules are equally applicable to the training of  soprano choir boys.    The results in beauty and power of tone which may be obtained from  carefully selected choir boys can seldom be equalled in the school-room,  first, because training is required to develop voices in strength and  purity of tone, and the time devoted generally to school singing, one  hour a week possibly, is no more than that given to a single rehearsal  of choristers.    Again school singing includes all members of the class, and while it is  true that there may be but few pupils in each room who cannot sing, yet  there are likely to be some.    These voices, which we call monotones disappear almost entirely when  pupils are trained to use the head voice. Still, there is a percentage  in every class in school, whose inherited musical perceptions are very  feeble, and their slowness cannot but retard the general progress.    Many of the difficulties that beset the teacher of music in schools,  then, are eliminated at the start by the choir trainer, when he selects  boys with good voices, who sing in tune naturally.    The increase in the number of vested choirs in this country has been  very rapid during the past few years, and fortunately, the ideas which  have prevailed among the majority of choir-masters on the subject of the  boy voice, have been just. This is easily understood when we reflect  that we have made the best English standards our ideal.    The leaven of sound doctrine on the boy voice is working rapidly, and  there are many choirs both in our large and small cities that are  excellent examples of well-trained soprano boys.    There is, however, one problem of male choir training which is not yet  satisfactorily solved, at least it is troublesome to those choirs which  have a small or moderate appropriation for music.    Boy sopranos are plentiful, basses and tenors are easily obtained, but  good male altos, men, not boys, are almost unknown outside of a few  large cities. This state of affair has led, in many cases, to the  employment of boys as altos, and they have of course sung with the thick  or chest voice. It is an unmanageable and unmusical voice, it is harsh,  unsympathetic, hard to keep in tune, its presence in a choir is a  constant menace to the soprano tone, and were it not for the idea that  there is no recourse from this voice, save in the employment of woman  altos, it would not be tolerated by musicians.    There is a recourse, however, and it is at the command of every choir  trainer whose sopranos have been taught to sing with the head voice  alone. It is to select certain sopranos, and when the voice breaks, let  them pass to the alto part, and _continue to use the head voice_.    The objection which will naturally occur, is, that no singing should be  permitted during the break. Well, let us consider. The period during  which the voice, in common parlance, is breaking, is a period of  laryngeal growth, just as inevitable and natural, as is the growth of  the body generally. The voice may be fractured, but the larynx is not.    Every choir trainer must have observed the preliminaries to this period.  A boy for instance, shows all at once a sudden increase of volume and  finds it difficult to sing unless quite loudly or softly.    This shows that the vocal bands are relaxed. Following this, the  speaking voice will lower in pitch, and show hoarseness at times. As  soon though, as this hoarseness passes away, that is, when the  congestion at the larynx has passed, the voice is better perhaps than  before. Then comes another break, as we say, that is, a period of sore  throat and hoarseness.    After this has passed, it may be that the boy has lost his upper notes,  but can sing the lower ones with ease; the tone too, is changed in  timbre. It has the color of the man's head voice; or it may be that the  boy can still sing his high notes, but that the lower ones are  uncertain. Voice mutation is not one continuous period of growth of  vocal bands and laryngeal cartilages. On the contrary, the periods of  vocal disturbance are separated by intervals when the throat is  comparatively free from irritation. These intervals may be long or  short. It evidently depends upon the rapidity or slowness of the general  growth and development.    There can be no doubt now, that during a time when the voice is  uncertain and hoarse from the irritation of the vocal bands and  surrounding parts, that singing is positively harmful, but during the  intervals separating these periods, especially where they extend, as in  many cases, over several months, it would seem that the singing voice  might be used.    Each individual case must be observed and judged by itself. This is  entirely possible in choirs. If then the choir-master is careful to  observe and to humor the changing voice at all critical times; if he  will insist that the boy sing very lightly or not at all if it hurts  him, and if he will resolutely check any tendency to break into the  tenor or chest quality, he can train in a short time a good alto force  from his choir, and these young men so trained may become efficient male  alto singers.
