In the  simplest case one atom of the one element combines with one atom of the  other. If the sulphur and the iron atoms never change their respective  masses when they unite to form a molecule of iron sulphide, all iron  sulphide molecules will have equal amounts of iron in them and also of  sulphur. Consequently any mass made up of iron sulphide molecules will  have the same fraction of iron by weight as do the individual iron  sulphide molecules. Iron sulphide, from whatever source, will have the  same composition, which is in accordance with the law of definite  composition.    3. _The atomic hypothesis and the law of multiple proportion._ But this  simplest case may not always be the only one. Under other conditions one  atom of iron might combine with two of sulphur to form a molecule of a  second compound. In such a case the one atom of iron would be in  combination with twice the mass of sulphur that is in the first  compound, since the sulphur atoms all have equal masses. What is true  for one molecule will be true for any number of them; consequently when  such quantities of these two compounds are selected as are found to  contain the same amount of iron, the one will contain twice as much  sulphur as the other.    The combination between the atoms may of course take place in other  simple ratios. For example, two atoms of one element might combine with  three or with five of the other. In all such cases it is clear that the  law of multiple proportion must hold true. For on selecting such numbers  of the two kinds of molecules as have the same number of the one kind of  atoms, the numbers of the other kind of atoms will stand in some simple  ratio to each other, and their weights will therefore stand in the same  simple ratio.    ~Testing the hypothesis.~ Efforts have been made to find compounds which  do not conform to these laws, but all such attempts have resulted in  failure. If such compounds should be found, the laws would be no longer  true, and the hypothesis of Dalton would cease to possess value. When an  hypothesis has been tested in every way in which experiment can test it,  and is still found to be in harmony with the facts in the case, it is  termed a _theory_. We now speak of the atomic theory rather than of the  atomic hypothesis.    ~Value of a theory.~ The value of a theory is twofold. It aids in the  clear understanding of the laws of nature because it gives an  intelligent idea as to why these laws should be in operation.    A theory also leads to discoveries. It usually happens that in testing a  theory much valuable work is done, and many new facts are discovered.  Almost any theory in explaining given laws will involve a number of  consequences apart from the laws it seeks to explain. Experiment will  soon show whether these facts are as the theory predicts they will be.  Thus Dalton's atomic theory predicted many properties of gases which  experiment has since verified.    ~Atomic weights.~ It would be of great advantage in the study of chemistry  if we could determine the weights of the different kinds of atoms. It is  evident that this cannot be done directly. They are so small that they  cannot be seen even with a most powerful microscope. It is calculated  that it would take 200,000,000 hydrogen atoms placed side by side to  make a row one centimeter long. No balance can weigh such minute  objects. It is possible, however, to determine their relative  weights,--that is, how much heavier one is than another. _These relative  weights of the atoms are spoken of as the atomic weights of the  elements._    If elements were able to combine in only one way,--one atom of one with  one atom of another,--the problem of determining the atomic weights  would be very simple. We should merely have to take some one convenient  element as a standard, and find by experiment how much of each other  element would combine with a fixed weight of it. The ratios thus found  would be the same ratios as those between the atoms of the elements, and  thus we should have their relative atomic weights. The law of multiple  proportion calls attention to the fact that the atoms combine in other  ratios than 1: 1, and there is no direct way of telling which one, if  any, of the several compounds in a given case is the one consisting of a  single atom of each element.    If some way were to be found of telling how much heavier the entire  molecule of a compound is than the atom chosen as a standard,--that is,  of determining the molecular weights of compounds,--the problem could be  solved, though its solution would not be an entirely simple matter.  There are ways of determining the molecular weights of compounds, and  there are other experiments which throw light directly upon the relative  weights of the atoms. These methods cannot be described until the facts  upon which they rest have been studied. It will be sufficient for the  present to assume that these methods are trustworthy.    ~Standard for atomic weights.~ Since the atomic weights are merely  relative to some one element chosen as a standard, it is evident that  any one of the elements may serve as this standard and that any  convenient value may be assigned to its atom. At one time oxygen was  taken as this standard, with the value 100, and the atomic weights of  the other elements were expressed in terms of this standard. It would  seem more rational to take the element of smallest atomic weight as the  standard and give it unit value; accordingly hydrogen was taken as the  standard with an atomic weight of 1. Very recently, however, this unit  has been replaced by oxygen, with an atomic weight of 16.    ~Why oxygen is chosen as the standard for atomic weights.~ In the  determination of the atomic weight of an element it is necessary to find  the weight of the element which combines with a definite weight of  another element, preferably the element chosen as the standard. Since  oxygen combines with the elements far more readily than does hydrogen to  form definite compounds, it is far better adapted for the standard  element, and has accordingly replaced hydrogen as the standard. Any  definite value might be given to the weight of the oxygen atom. In  assigning a value to it, however, it is convenient to choose a whole  number, and as small a number as possible without making the atomic  weight of any other element less than unity. For these reasons the  number 16 has been chosen as the atomic weight of oxygen. This makes  the atomic weight of hydrogen equal to 1.008, so that there is but  little difference between taking oxygen as 16 and hydrogen as 1 for the  unit.    The atomic weights of the elements are given in the Appendix.      EXERCISES    1. Two compounds were found to have the following compositions: (a)  oxygen = 69.53%, nitrogen = 30.47%; (b) oxygen = 53.27%, nitrogen =  46.73%. Show that the law of multiple proportion holds in this case.    2. Two compounds were found to have the following compositions: (a)  oxygen = 43.64%, phosphorus = 56.36%; (b) oxygen = 56.35%, phosphorus  = 43.65%. Show that the law of multiple proportion holds in this case.    3. Why did Dalton assume that all the atoms of a given element have the  same weight?          CHAPTER VI    CHEMICAL EQUATIONS AND CALCULATIONS      ~Formulas.~ Since the molecule of any chemical compound consists of a  definite number of atoms, and this number never changes without  destroying the identity of the compound, it is very convenient to  represent the composition of a compound by indicating the composition of  its molecules. This can be done very easily by using the symbols of the  atoms to indicate the number and the kind of the atoms which constitute  the molecule. HgO will in this way represent mercuric oxide, a molecule  of which has been found to contain 1 atom each of mercury and oxygen.  H_{2}O will represent water, the molecules of which consist of 1 atom of  oxygen and 2 of hydrogen, the subscript figure indicating the number of  the atoms of the element whose symbol precedes it. H_{2}SO_{4} will  stand for sulphuric acid, the molecules of which contain 2 atoms of  hydrogen, 1 of sulphur, and 4 of oxygen. The combination of symbols  which represents the molecule of a substance is called its _formula_.    ~Equations.~ When a given substance undergoes a chemical change it is  possible to represent this change by the use of such symbols and  formulas. In a former chapter it was shown that mercuric oxide  decomposes when heated to form mercury and oxygen. This may be expressed  very briefly in the form of the equation        (1) HgO = Hg + O.    When water is electrolyzed two new substances, hydrogen and oxygen, are  formed from it. This statement in the form of an equation is        (2) H_{2}O = 2H + O.    The coefficient before the symbol for hydrogen indicates that a single  molecule of water yields two atoms of hydrogen on decomposition.    In like manner the combination of sulphur with iron is expressed by the  equation        (3) Fe + S = FeS.    The decomposition of potassium chlorate by heat takes place as  represented by the equation        (4) KClO_{3} = KCl + 3O.    ~Reading of equations.~ Since equations are simply a kind of shorthand way  of indicating chemical changes which occur under certain conditions, in  reading an equation the full statement for which it stands should be  given.

Effie was  seduced by Geordie Robertson (_alias_ George Staunton), while in the  service of Mrs. Saddletree. She murdered her infant, and was condemned  to death; but her half-sister, Jeanie, went to London, pleaded her cause  before the queen, and obtained her pardon. Jeanie, on her return to  Scotland, married Reuben Butler; and Geordie Robertson (then Sir George  Staunton) married Effie. Sir George being shot by a gypsy boy, Effie  (_i.e._ Lady Staunton), retired to a convent on the Continent.--Sir W.  Scott, _Heart of Midlothian_ (time, George II.).      =Midshipman Easy.= (See EASY.)      =Midsummer Night's Dream.= Shakespeare says there was a law in Athens,  that if a daughter refused to marry the husband selected for her by her  father, she might be put to death. Eg[=e]us (3 _syl._), an Athenian,  promised to give his daughter, Hermia, in marriage to Dem[=e]trius; but,  as the lady loved Lysander, she refused to marry the man selected by her  father, and fled from Athens with her lover. Demetrius went in pursuit  of her, followed by Hel[)e]na, who doted on him. All four came to a  forest, and fell asleep. In their dreams a vision of fairies passed  before them, and on awaking, Demetrius resolved to forego Hermia, who  disliked him, and to take to wife Helena, who sincerely loved him. When  Egeus was informed thereof, he readily agreed to give his daughter to  Lysander, and the force of the law was not called into action (1592).    [Asterism] Several of the incidents of this comedy are borrowed from the  _Diana_ of Montemayor, a Spaniard (sixteenth century).      =Midwinter= (_Ozias_), the _alias_ of another Allan Armadale.

She held the male sex in utter contempt, but had a  secret exception in favor of Sim Tappertit, who irreverently called her  \"scraggy.\" Miss Miggs always sided with madam against master, and made  out that she was a suffering martyr, and he an inhuman Nero. She called  ma'am \"mim;\" said her sister lived at \"twenty-sivin;\" Simon she called  \"Simmun.\" She said Mrs. Varden was \"the mildest, amiablest,  forgivingest-sperited, longest-sufferingest female in existence.\"  Baffled in all her matrimonial hopes, she was at last appointed female  turnkey to a county Bridewell, which office she held for thirty years,  when she died.         Miss Miggs, baffled in all her schemes ... and cast upon a       thankless, undeserving world, turned very sharp and sour ... but       the justices of the peace for Middlesex ... selected her from 124       competitors to the office of turnkey for a county Bridewell, which       she held till her decease, more than thirty years afterwards,       remaining single all that time.--C.

Of all dwarfs he was the smallest. His feet were like an eagle's,       and close to the knees, for legs he had none. His royal robes were       not above half a yard long, and trailed one-third part upon the       ground. His head was as big as a peck, and his nose long enough for       twelve birds to perch on. His beard was bushy enough for a canary's       nest, and his ears reached a foot above his head.--Comtesse       D'Aulnoy, _Fairy Tales_ (\"The White Cat,\" 1682).      =Mikado= (_of Japan_), the hero of Gilbert and Sullivan's opera \"The  Mikado.\" The plot turns upon the complications brought about [TN-11] the  Mikado's severe laws against flirting:       \"So he decreed in words succint,      That all who flirted, leered or winked,      Unless connubially linked,      Should forthwith be beheaded.\"      =Mi'lan= (_The duke of_), an Italian prince, an ally of the  Lancastrians.--Sir W.
