At a crisis when I would have  given a month's income to have said something neat, epigrammatic,  suggestive, yet withal courteous and respectful, I could only find a  hackneyed, unenthusiastic phrase which I should have used in accepting  an invitation from a bore to lunch with him at his club.    \"Of course you understand my friends must be my father's friends.\"    \"Yes,\" I said gloomily, \"I suppose so.\"    \"So you must not think me rude if I--I--\"    \"Cut me,\" said I with masculine coarseness.    \"Don't seem to see you,\" said she, with feminine delicacy, \"when I am  with my father. You will understand?\"    \"I shall understand.\"    \"You see\"--she smiled--\"you are under arrest, as Tom says.\"    Tom!    \"I see,\" I said.    \"Good-by.\"    \"Good-by.\"    I watched her out of sight, and went on to interview Mr. Leigh.    We had a long and intensely uninteresting conversation about the  maladies to which chickens are subject. He was verbose and  reminiscent. He took me over his farm, pointing out as he went  Dorkings and Cochin Chinas which he had cured of diseases generally  fatal, with, as far as I could gather, Christian Science principles.    I left at last with instructions to paint the throats of the stricken  birds with turpentine--a task imagination boggled at, and one which I  proposed to leave exclusively to Ukridge and the hired retainer. As I  had a slight headache, a visit to the Cob would, I thought, do me  good. I had missed my bath that morning, and was in need of a breath  of sea air.    It was high tide, and there was deep water on three sides of the Cob.    In a small boat in the offing Professor Derrick appeared, fishing. I  had seen him engaged in this pursuit once or twice before. His only  companion was a gigantic boatman, by name Harry Hawk.    I sat on the seat at the end of the Cob, and watched the professor. It  was an instructive sight, an object lesson to those who hold that  optimism has died out of the race. I had never seen him catch a fish.  He did not look to me as if he were at all likely to catch a fish. Yet  he persevered.    There are few things more restful than to watch some one else busy  under a warm sun. As I sat there, my mind ranged idly over large  subjects and small. I thought of love and chicken farming. I mused on  the immortality of the soul. In the end I always returned to the  professor. Sitting, as I did, with my back to the beach, I could see  nothing but his boat. It had the ocean to itself.    I began to ponder over the professor. I wondered dreamily if he were  very hot. I tried to picture his boyhood. I speculated on his future,  and the pleasure he extracted from life.    It was only when I heard him call out to Hawk to be careful, when a  movement on the part of that oarsman set the boat rocking, that I  began to weave romances round him in which I myself figured.    But, once started, I progressed rapidly. I imagined a sudden upset.  Professor struggling in water. Myself (heroically): \"Courage! I'm  coming!\" A few rapid strokes. Saved! Sequel: A subdued professor,  dripping salt water and tears of gratitude, urging me to become his  son-in-law. That sort of thing happened in fiction. It was a shame  that it should not happen in real life. In my hot youth I once had  seven stories in seven weekly penny papers in the same month all  dealing with a situation of the kind. Only the details differed. In  \"Not Really a Coward,\" Vincent Devereux had rescued the earl's  daughter from a fire, whereas in \"Hilda's Hero\" it was the peppery old  father whom Tom Slingsby saved. Singularly enough, from drowning. In  other words, I, a very mediocre scribbler, had effected seven times in  a single month what the powers of the universe could not manage once,  even on the smallest scale.    I was a little annoyed with the powers of the universe.           *       *       *       *       *    It was at precisely three minutes to twelve--for I had just consulted  my watch--that the great idea surged into my brain. At four minutes to  twelve I had been grumbling impotently at Providence. By two minutes  to twelve I had determined upon a manly and independent course of  action.    Briefly, it was this. Since dramatic accident and rescue would not  happen of its own accord, I would arrange one for myself. Hawk looked  to me the sort of man who would do anything in a friendly way for a  few shillings.           *       *       *       *       *    That afternoon I interviewed Mr. Hawk at the Net and Mackerel.    \"Hawk,\" I said to him darkly, over a mystic and conspirator-like pot,  \"I want you, the next time you take Professor Derrick out  fishing\"--here I glanced round, to make sure that we were not  overheard--\"to upset him.\"    His astonished face rose slowly from the rim of the pot, like a full  moon.    \"What 'ud I do that for?\" he gasped.    \"Five shillings, I hope,\" said I; \"but I am prepared to go to ten.\"    He gurgled.    I argued with the man. I was eloquent, but at the same time concise.  My choice of words was superb. I crystallized my ideas into pithy  sentences which a child could have understood.    At the end of half an hour he had grasped all the salient points of  the scheme. Also he imagined that I wished the professor upset by way  of a practical joke. He gave me to understand that this was the type  of humor which was to be expected from a gentleman from London. I am  afraid he must at one period of his career have lived at one of those  watering places to which trippers congregate. He did not seem to think  highly of the Londoner.    I let it rest at that. I could not give my true reason, and this  served as well as any.    At the last moment he recollected that he, too, would get wet when the  accident took place, and raised his price to a sovereign.    A mercenary man. It is painful to see how rapidly the old simple  spirit is dying out in rural districts. Twenty years ago a fisherman  would have been charmed to do a little job like that for a shilling.          THE BRAVE PRESERVER    XI      I could have wished, during the next few days, that Mr. Harry Hawk's  attitude toward myself had not been so unctuously confidential and  mysterious. It was unnecessary, in my opinion, for him to grin  meaningly whenever he met me in the street. His sly wink when we  passed each other on the Cob struck me as in indifferent taste. The  thing had been definitely arranged (half down and half when it was  over), and there was no need for any cloak and dark-lantern effects. I  objected strongly to being treated as the villain of a melodrama. I  was merely an ordinary well-meaning man, forced by circumstances into  doing the work of Providence. Mr. Hawk's demeanor seemed to say:    \"We are two reckless scoundrels, but bless you, _I_ won't give away  your guilty secret.\"    The climax came one morning as I was going along the street toward the  beach. I was passing a dark doorway, when out shimmered Mr. Hawk as if  he had been a specter instead of the most substantial man within a  radius of ten miles.    \"St!\" he whispered.    \"Now look here, Hawk,\" I said wrathfully, for the start he had given  me had made me bite my tongue, \"this has got to stop. I refuse to be  haunted in this way. What is it now?\"    \"Mr. Derrick goes out this morning, zur.\"    \"Thank goodness for that,\" I said. \"Get it over this morning, then,  without fail. I couldn't stand another day of this.\"    I went on to the Cob, where I sat down. I was excited. Deeds of great  import must shortly be done. I felt a little nervous. It would never  do to bungle the thing. Suppose by some accident I were to drown the  professor, or suppose that, after all, he contented himself with a  mere formal expression of thanks and refused to let bygones be  bygones. These things did not bear thinking of.    I got up and began to pace restlessly to and fro.    Presently from the farther end of the harbor there put off Mr. Hawk's  boat, bearing its precious cargo. My mouth became dry with excitement.    Very slowly Mr. Hawk pulled round the end of the Cob, coming to a  standstill some dozen yards from where I was performing my beat. It  was evidently here that the scene of the gallant rescue had been  fixed.    My eyes were glued upon Mr. Hawk's broad back. The boat lay almost  motionless on the water. I had never seen the sea smoother.    It seemed as if this perfect calm might continue for ever. Mr. Hawk  made no movement. Then suddenly the whole scene changed to one of vast  activity. I heard Mr. Hawk utter a hoarse cry, and saw him plunge  violently in his seat. The professor turned half round, and I caught  sight of his indignant face, pink with emotion. Then the scene changed  again with the rapidity of a dissolving view. I saw Mr. Hawk give  another plunge, and the next moment the boat was upside down in the  water, and I was shooting head foremost to the bottom, oppressed with  the indescribably clammy sensation which comes when one's clothes are  thoroughly wet.    I rose to the surface close to the upturned boat. The first sight I  saw was the spluttering face of Mr. Hawk. I ignored him and swam to  where the professor's head bobbed on the waters.    \"Keep cool,\" I said. A silly remark in the circumstances.    He was swimming energetically but unskillfully. In his shore clothes  it would have taken him at least a week to struggle to land.    I knew all about saving people from drowning. We used to practice it  with a dummy in the swimming bath at school. I attacked him from the  rear and got a good grip of him by the shoulders. I then swam on my  back in the direction of land, and beached him at the feet of an  admiring crowd. I had thought of putting him under once or twice just  to show him he was being rescued, but decided against such a course as  needlessly realistic. As it was, I fancy he had"]]]
