Leonardo  must have loved the picture himself, and it is not strange that he  lavished more time upon it than he gave to the great picture of the Last  Supper (Fig. 37).    Leonardo sold this picture to Francis I. for nine thousand dollars, which  was then an enormous sum, though now one could scarcely fix a price upon  it. In 1860 the Emperor of Russia paid twelve thousand dollars for a St.  Sebastian by Leonardo, and in 1865 a madonna by him was sold in Paris for  about sixteen thousand dollars. Of course his pictures are rarely sold;  but, when they are, great sums are given for them.    In 1502 Caesar Borgia appointed Leonardo his engineer and sent him to  travel through Central Italy to inspect his fortresses; but this usurper  soon fled to Spain, and in 1503 our painter was again in Florence. In 1504  his father died. From 1507 to 1512 Leonardo was at the summit of his  greatness. Louis XII. appointed him his painter, and he labored for this  monarch also to improve the water-works of Milan. For seven years he dwelt  at Milan, making frequent journeys to Florence. But the political troubles  of the time made Lombardy an uncongenial home for any artist, and  Leonardo, with a few pupils, went to Florence and then on to Rome. Pope  Leo X. received him cordially enough, and told him to \"work for the glory  of God, Italy, Leo X., and Leonardo da Vinci.\" But Leonardo was not happy  in Rome, where Michael Angelo and Raphael were in great favor, and when  Francis I. made his successes in Italy in 1515, Leonardo hastened to  Lombardy to meet him. The new king of France restored him to the office to  which Louis XII. had appointed him, and gave him an annual pension of  seven hundred gold crowns.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--MONA LISA.--\"LA BELLE JOCONDE.\"]    When Francis returned to France he desired to cut out the wall on which  the Last Supper was painted, and carry it to his own country: this proved  to be impossible, and it is much to be regretted, as it is probable that  if it could have been thus removed it would have been better preserved.  However, not being able to take the artist's great work, the king took  Leonardo himself, together with his favorite pupils and friends and his  devoted servant. In France, Leonardo was treated with consideration. He  resided near Amboise, where he could mingle with the court. It is said  that, old though he was, he was so much admired that the courtiers  imitated his dress and the cut of his beard and hair. He was given the  charge of all artistic matters in France, and doubtless Francis hoped that  he would found an Academy as he had done at Milan. But he seems to have  left all his energy, all desire for work, on the Italian side of the Alps.  He made a few plans; but he brought no great thing to pass, and soon his  health failed, and he fell into a decline. He gave great attention to  religious matters, received the sacrament, and then made his will, and put  his worldly affairs in order.    The king was accustomed to visit him frequently, and on the last day of  his life, when the sovereign entered the room, Leonardo desired to be  raised up as a matter of respect to the king: sitting, he conversed of his  sufferings, and lamented that he had done so little for God and man. Just  then he was seized with an attack of pain--the king rose to support him,  and thus, in the arms of Francis, the great master breathed his last. This  has sometimes been doubted; but the modern French critics agree with the  ancient writers who give this account of his end.    He was buried in the Church of St. Florentin at Amboise, and it is not  known that any monument was erected over him. In 1808 the church was  destroyed; in 1863 Arsine Houssaye, with others, made a search for the  grave of Leonardo, and it is believed that his remains were found. In  1873 a noble monument was erected in Milan to the memory of Da Vinci. It  is near the entrance to the Arcade of Victor Emmanuel: the statue of the  master stands on a high pedestal in a thoughtful attitude, the head bowed  down and the arms crossed on the breast. Below are other statues and rich  bas-reliefs, and one inscription speaks of him as the \"Renewer of the Arts  and Sciences.\"    Many of his writings are in the libraries of Europe in manuscript form:  his best known work is the \"Trattato della Pittura,\" and has been  translated into English. As an engineer his canal of Mortesana was enough  to give him fame; as an artist he may be called the \"Poet of Painters,\"  and, if those who followed him surpassed him, it should be remembered that  it is easier to advance in a path once opened than to discover a new path.  Personally he was much beloved, and, though he lived when morals were at a  low estimate, he led a proper and reputable life. His pictures were pure  in their spirit, and he seemed only to desire the progress of art and  science, and it is a pleasure to read and learn of him, as it is to see  his works.    Other good artists of the Lombard school in the fifteenth century were  BERNARDINO LUINI (about 1460-1530), who was the best pupil of Leonardo,  GIOVANNI ANTONIO BELTRAFFIO (1467-1516), GAUDENZIO FARRARI (1484-1549),  AMBROGIO BORGOGNONE (works dated about 1500), and ANDREA SOLARIO, whose  age is not known.    We return now to the Florentine school at a time when the most remarkable  period of its existence was about to begin. We shall speak first of FRA  BARTOLOMMEO or BACCIO DELLA PORTA, also called IL FRATE (1469-1517). He  was born at Savignano, and studied at Florence under Cosimo Rosselli, but  was much influenced by the works of Leonardo da Vinci. This painter became  famous for the beauty of his pictures of the Madonna, and at the time  when the great Savonarola went to Florence Bartolommeo was employed in the  Convent of San Marco, where the preacher lived. The artist became the  devoted friend of the preacher, and, when the latter was seized, tortured,  and burned, Bartolommeo became a friar, and left his pictures to be  finished by his pupil Albertinelli. For four years he lived the most  austere life, and did not touch his brush: then his superior commanded him  to resume his art; but the painter had no interest in it. About this time  Raphael sought him out, and became his friend; he also instructed the monk  in perspective, and in turn Raphael learned from him, for Fra Bartolommeo  was the first artist who used lay figures in arranging his draperies; he  also told Raphael some secrets of colors.    About 1513 Bartolommeo went to Rome, and after his return to his convent  he began what promised to be a wonderful artistic career; but he only  lived four years more, and the amount of his work was so small that his  pictures are now rare. His madonnas, saints, and angels are holy in their  effect; his representations of architecture are grand, and while his works  are not strong or powerful, they give much pleasure to those who see them.    MICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI was born at the Castle of Caprese in 1475. His  father, who was of a noble family of Florence, was then governor of  Caprese and Chiusi, and, when the Buonarroti household returned to  Florence, the little Angelo was left with his nurse on one of his father's  estates at Settignano. The father and husband of his nurse were  stone-masons, and thus in infancy the future artist was in the midst of  blocks of stone and marble and the implements which he later used with so  much skill. For many years rude sketches were shown upon the walls of the  nurse's house made by her baby charge, and he afterward said that he  imbibed a love for marble with his earliest food.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--PORTRAIT OF MICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI.]    At the proper age Angelo was taken to Florence and placed in school; but  he spent his time mostly in drawing, and having made the acquaintance of  Francesco Granacci, at that time a pupil with Ghirlandajo, he borrowed  from him designs and materials by which to carry on his beloved pursuits.  Michael Angelo's desire to become an artist was violently opposed by his  father and his uncles, for they desired him to be a silk and woollen  merchant, and sustain the commercial reputation of the family. But so  determined was he that finally his father yielded, and in 1488 placed him  in the studio of Ghirlandajo. Here the boy of thirteen worked with great  diligence; he learned how to prepare colors and to lay the groundwork of  frescoes, and he was set to copy drawings. Very soon he wearied of this,  and began to make original designs after his own ideas. At one time he  corrected a drawing of his master's: when he saw this, sixty years later,  he said, \"I almost think that I knew more of art in my youth than I do in  my old age.\"    When Michael Angelo went to Ghirlandajo, that master was employed on the  restoration of the choir of Santa Maria Novella, so that the boy came at  once into the midst of important work. One day he drew a picture of the  scaffolding and all that belonged to it, with the painters at work  thereon: when his master saw it he exclaimed, \"He already understands more  than I do myself.\" This excellence in the scholar roused the jealousy of  the master, as well as of his other pupils, and it was a relief to Michael  Angelo when, in answer to a request from Lorenzo de Medici, he and  Francesco Granacci were named by Ghirlandajo as his two most promising  scholars, and were then sent to the Academy which the duke had  established. The art treasures which Lorenzo gave for the use of the  students were arranged in the gardens of San Marco, and here, under the  instruction of the old Bertoldo, Angelo forgot painting in his enthusiasm  for sculpture. He first copied the face of a faun; but he changed it  somewhat, and opened the mouth so that the teeth could be seen. When  Lorenzo visited the garden he praised the work, but said, \"You have made  your faun so old, and yet you have left him all his teeth;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#13)"],[1," the first of the inhabitants of Upper Georgia to take  up the cause of American independence; and his example, for he was a  notable man even in private life, did much to solidify and strengthen  those who leaned to that cause. When the British troops marched from the  coast into Upper Georgia, Elijah thought the time had come to take  his gun from the rack over the door, and make at least some show of  resistance. His courage, and the firmness and decision of his character,  made him the natural leader of those of his neighbors whose sympathies  were with the Liberty Boys in other parts of the State, and he soon  found himself a commander without commission or title. He cared less  for these things than for the principles of liberty for which he was  fighting.    For a while Elijah Clarke and his followers fought as partisan rangers,  but he soon drew around him a compact and disciplined body of men who  were ready to go wherever he might lead them. He did not confine his  efforts to his new neighborhood We hear of him with Howe's ill-fated  expedition against East Florida, where, at Alligator Creek, he was asked  to perform the impossible feat of storming with a troop of horse a camp  intrenched behind logs and brushwood. He was no doubt amazed at the  stupidity of General Howe in issuing such an order, but he attempted to  carry it out with his usual courage. He did succeed in floundering over  the logs with his troops, but he came to a ditch that was too wide for  his horses to leap, and too deep to be ridden through. At this moment he  and his men were saluted with a heavy fire from the enemy, and they were  compelled to retire in confusion. In this attempt Elijah Clarke was shot  through the thigh. Later he was in South Carolina, at Blackstocks, and  at The Cowpens.    In some quarters an effort has been made to blacken the reputation of  General Clarke by comparing his treatment of the Tories with the mild  and humane policy pursued by Francis Marion. There was, indeed, some  misunderstanding between the two men in regard to the methods that might  be adopted. The policy of Marion was undoubtedly the correct one, so far  as South Carolina was concerned; but if the Tories in that Province had  been guilty of the crimes committed by their brethren in Wilkes and the  surrounding region, General Marion's policy would not have been very  different from that of General Clarke. The Tories with whom Clarke was  familiar were guilty of murder, rapine, pillage, and incendiarism. The  Tories in South Carolina were kept under by the presence of Marion and  his men. Clarke went wherever his services were needed; and during his  absence, the Tories of the Broad River region were free to commit  every excess. Marion refused to leave the region where he made his name  famous, and thus kept the Tories in constant fear and dread.    Who shall say that Marion would not have been as ready to exterminate  the Tories as Clarke was, or that Clarke would not have been as humane  as Marion, if each of these distinguished patriots had been in the  other's place?    At the battle of Kettle Creek, in what is now Wilkes County, Elijah  Clarke distinguished himself by his readiness and skill as a commander.  The Americans under Colonel Pickens were in pursuit of the British under  Colonel Boyd. Their line of march was the order of battle, and following  the vanguard came the right and left wings. The left wing was commanded  by Elijah Clarke. The center was led by Colonel Pickens, who was in  command of the expedition. Colonel Boyd, the British commander, appeared  to be unconscious of pursuit. He had halted on a farm on the north side  of Kettle Creek. His horses were left to forage on the young cane that  grew on the edge of the swamp; and his men were slaying cattle and  parching corn, preparing for a feast after their short rations. The  British encampment was formed near the creek, on a piece of open ground  flanked on two sides by a canebrake. Colonel Boyd was in utter ignorance  of the approach of the Americans, who advanced at once to the attack.  The British colonel formed his line in the rear of his encampment, and  there received the assault. The battle was hotly contested for more than  an hour, and then the Tories retreated through the swamp.    Elijah Clarke, seeing a piece of rising ground on the farther side  of the creek, on which he suspected the Loyalists would try to form,  ordered the left wing to follow him, and was about to cross the stream  when his horse was shot under him. Mounting another, he soon crossed  the creek, followed by not more than a fourth of his division. There had  been some mistake in sending the order along the line. Clarke gained the  hill that had attracted his eye just in time to attack Major Spurgen, a  brave British officer, who was forming his command. The firing attracted  the notice of the rest of Clarke's division, and they soon joined their  leader. Pickens and Dooly also pressed through the swamp, and the battle  was renewed with great vigor. For a while the result was in doubt,  but at the end the Americans held the hill. The Tories fled in all  directions, leaving seventy dead on the field, and seventy-five wounded  and captured. Of the Americans, nine were slain, and twenty-three  wounded. To Elijah Clarke must be given the credit for this victory,  which, coming at the time it did, revived the hopes and courage of the  Liberty Boys in all parts of the country.    The Tories, on the other hand, were so depressed by it, that many  of them left that part of the State, and those who remained became  comparatively quiet. The situation was so encouraging, that many of the  people of Georgia, who had been driven from their homes by the cruelty  of the Tories, returned with their families. They were not long left in  peace, however. The British and the Tories had their active agents among  the Creeks and Cherokees, urging these tribes to take up arms and attack  the Americans. In view of this, Clarke was sent to guard the frontier  forts. Then the Tories again began to pillage and devastate the Broad  River region. Some of the crimes they committed would have disgraced  savages. Clarke's house was burned, and his family ordered to leave  the State. Mrs. Clarke and her two daughters started on their perilous  journey with nothing but a small pony of little value, and even this was  taken from them before they had gone very far. This only served to renew  the activity of Clarke in behalf of the American cause. He defeated  the Tories wherever he met them; and if he gave them no quarter, it was  because they had shown no mercy to the Americans. The savage character  of the warfare waged by the Tories against men, women, and children,  must ever stand as an explanation and as an excuse for the fierce spirit  displayed by Clarke and the Americans who lived in the Broad River  region.    In the battle near Musgrove's Mill, Clarke defeated the British, killing  sixty-three men, and wounding and capturing one hundred. During the  battle he was twice severely wounded on the head and neck; and once he  was surrounded by the enemy, captured, and placed in charge of two men.  One of these he knocked down with a blow of his fist, and the other  fled. At one time, acting without orders, he was near taking Augusta,  and was only prevented by the desire of his men to see their families.  After this he returned to Wilkes County, where he was compelled to take  under his protection nearly four hundred women and children who had been  driven from their homes by the savage Tories. He resolved to carry  these to a place of safety, and, with a sufficient guard, set out for  Kentucky. Cornwallis, hearing of this movement, and taking for granted  that it was a retreat, sent one hundred men under Captain Ferguson to  cut Clarke off, the supposition being that the great partisan fighter  would march through South Carolina, but he had re-crossed the mountains  in the Piedmont region. Hearing of this movement, Clarke detached  Major Chandler and Captain Johnston with thirty men to take part in  the operations against Ferguson. Thus it was the pursuit of Clarke that  brought on the memorable battle of Kings Mountain, which resulted in  a great victory for the cause of American independence; and although  Clarke was not there in person, his heroic spirit animated the brave men  who won the day.    He was the first to teach the militia to stand against the bayonets of  the British; and at Blackstocks, in South Carolina, at the head of his  Wilkes riflemen, he charged and drove the British light infantry in an  open field,--a movement that turned the enemy's right flank, and insured  the victory of the Americans. At the siege of Augusta, Clarke had  anticipated the movement of Colonel \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, and had  confined the British garrison to their works for weeks before Colonel  Lee's arrival.    At the close of the Revolution, Clarke led the movement against the  Indians. He defeated the Creeks in the battle of Jacks Creek. After  peace was declared, Clarke, who had been made a general by a grateful  State, settled on lands that had been reserved to the Indians. For this  he has been criticised very severely; but it is curious that the policy  for which he was attacked, shortly afterwards became the policy of the  whole people. The States and the United States have made treaties  with the Indians, only to break them. Having personal knowledge of the  Indians, and having been made the victim of some of their raids, he had  no respect for them or for their rights. To this view the whole country  afterwards came, and the red men disappeared before it.    It will be well to bear in mind, that, whatever failings he may have  had, there was not a more heroic figure in the Revolution than General  Elijah Clarke.          A WAR OF EXTERMINATION.
