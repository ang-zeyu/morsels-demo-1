A passive acceptance by us of the correct and  the proper did not satisfy him; he wanted us to love truth with our  whole hearts; he knew that mere acquiescence without love is empty. He  also knew that truth, if strayed from, can be found again, but a forced  or blind acceptance of it from the outside effectually bars the way in.    [Illustration: The Himalayas]    In my early youth I had conceived a fancy to journey along the Grand  Trunk Road, right up to Peshawar, in a bullock cart. No one else  supported the scheme, and doubtless there was much to be urged against  it as a practical proposition. But when I discoursed on it to my father  he was sure it was a splendid idea--travelling by railroad was not worth  the name! With which observation he proceeded to recount to me his own  adventurous wanderings on foot and horseback. Of any chance of  discomfort or peril he had not a word to say.    Another time, when I had just been appointed Secretary of the Adi Brahma  Samaj, I went over to my father, at his Park Street residence, and  informed him that I did not approve of the practice of only Brahmins  conducting divine service to the exclusion of other castes. He  unhesitatingly gave me permission to correct this if I could. When I got  the authority I found I lacked the power. I was able to discover  imperfections but could not create perfection! Where were the men? Where  was the strength in me to attract the right man? Had I the means to  build in the place of what I might break? Till the right man comes any  form is better than none--this, I felt, must have been my father's view  of the existing order. But he did not for a moment try to discourage me  by pointing out the difficulties.    As he allowed me to wander about the mountains at my will, so in the  quest for truth he left me free to select my path. He was not deterred  by the danger of my making mistakes, he was not alarmed at the prospect  of my encountering sorrow. He held up a standard, not a disciplinary  rod.    I would often talk to my father of home. Whenever I got a letter from  anyone at home I hastened to show it to him. I verily believe I was  thus the means of giving him many a picture he could have got from none  else. My father also let me read letters to him from my elder brothers.  This was his way of teaching me how I ought to write to him; for he by  no means underrated the importance of outward forms and ceremonial.    I am reminded of how in one of my second brother's letters he was  complaining in somewhat sanscritised phraseology of being worked to  death tied by the neck to his post of duty. My father asked me to  explain the sentiment. I did it in my way, but he thought a different  explanation would fit better. My overweening conceit made me stick to my  guns and argue the point with him at length. Another would have shut me  up with a snub, but my father patiently heard me out and took pains to  justify his view to me.    My father would sometimes tell me funny stories. He had many an anecdote  of the gilded youth of his time. There were some exquisites for whose  delicate skins the embroidered borders of even Dacca muslins were too  coarse, so that to wear muslins with the border torn off became, for a  time, the tip-top thing to do.    I was also highly amused to hear from my father for the first time the  story of the milkman who was suspected of watering his milk, and the  more men one of his customers detailed to look after his milking the  bluer the fluid became, till, at last, when the customer himself  interviewed him and asked for an explanation, the milkman avowed that if  more superintendents had to be satisfied it would only make the milk fit  to breed fish!    After I had thus spent a few months with him my father sent me back home  with his attendant Kishori.          PART IV          (16) My Return      The chains of the rigorous regime which had bound me snapped for good  when I set out from home. On my return I gained an accession of rights.  In my case my very nearness had so long kept me out of mind; now that I  had been out of sight I came back into view.    I got a foretaste of appreciation while still on the return journey.  Travelling alone as I was, with an attendant, brimming with health and  spirits, and conspicuous with my gold-worked cap, all the English people  I came across in the train made much of me.    When I arrived it was not merely a home-coming from travel, it was also  a return from my exile in the servants' quarters to my proper place in  the inner apartments. Whenever the inner household assembled in my  mother's room I now occupied a seat of honour. And she who was then the  youngest bride of our house lavished on me a wealth of affection and  regard.    In infancy the loving care of woman is to be had without the asking,  and, being as much a necessity as light and air, is as simply accepted  without any conscious response; rather does the growing child often  display an eagerness to free itself from the encircling web of woman's  solicitude. But the unfortunate creature who is deprived of this in its  proper season is beggared indeed. This had been my plight. So after  being brought up in the servants' quarters when I suddenly came in for a  profusion of womanly affection, I could hardly remain unconscious of it.    In the days when the inner apartments were as yet far away from me, they  were the elysium of my imagination. The zenana, which from an outside  view is a place of confinement, for me was the abode of all freedom.  Neither school nor Pandit were there; nor, it seemed to me, did anybody  have to do what they did not want to. Its secluded leisure had something  mysterious about it; one played about, or did as one liked and had not  to render an account of one's doings. Specially so with my youngest  sister, to whom, though she attended Nilkamal Pandit's class with us, it  seemed to make no difference in his behaviour whether she did her  lessons well or ill. Then again, while, by ten o'clock, we had to hurry  through our breakfast and be ready for school, she, with her queue  dangling behind, walked unconcernedly away, withinwards, tantalising us  to distraction.    And when the new bride, adorned with her necklace of gold, came into our  house, the mystery of the inner apartments deepened. She, who came from  outside and yet became one of us, who was unknown and yet our own,  attracted me strangely--with her I burned to make friends. But if by  much contriving I managed to draw near, my youngest sister would hustle  me off with: \"What d'you boys want here--get away outside.\" The insult  added to the disappointment cut me to the quick. Through the glass doors  of their cabinets one could catch glimpses of all manner of curious  playthings--creations of porcelain and glass--gorgeous in colouring and  ornamentation. We were not deemed worthy even to touch them, much less  could we muster up courage to ask for any to play with. Nevertheless  these rare and wonderful objects, as they were to us boys, served to  tinge with an additional attraction the lure of the inner apartments.    Thus had I been kept at arm's length with repeated rebuffs. As the outer  world, so, for me, the interior, was unattainable. Wherefore the  impressions of it that I did get appeared to me like pictures.    After nine in the evening, my lessons with Aghore Babu over, I am  retiring within for the night. A murky flickering lantern is hanging in  the long venetian-screened corridor leading from the outer to the inner  apartments. At its end this passage turns into a flight of four or five  steps, to which the light does not reach, and down which I pass into the  galleries running round the first inner quadrangle. A shaft of moonlight  slants from the eastern sky into the western angle of these verandahs,  leaving the rest in darkness. In this patch of light the maids have  gathered and are squatting close together, with legs outstretched,  rolling cotton waste into lamp-wicks, and chatting in undertones of  their village homes. Many such pictures are indelibly printed on my  memory.    Then after our supper, the washing of our hands and feet on the verandah  before stretching ourselves on the ample expanse of our bed; whereupon  one of the nurses Tinkari or Sankari comes and sits by our heads and  softly croons to us the story of the prince travelling on and on over  the lonely moor, and, as it comes to an end, silence falls on the room.  With my face to the wall I gaze at the black and white patches, made by  the plaster of the walls fallen off here and there, showing faintly in  the dim light; and out of these I conjure up many a fantastic image as I  drop off to sleep. And sometimes, in the middle of the night, I hear  through my half-broken sleep the shouts of old Swarup, the watchman,  going his rounds from verandah to verandah.    Then came the new order, when I got in profusion from this inner  unknown dreamland of my fancies the recognition for which I had all  along been pining; when that which naturally should have come day by day  was suddenly made good to me with accumulated arrears. I cannot say that  my head was not turned.    The little traveller was full of the story of his travels, and, with the  strain of each repetition, the narrative got looser and looser till it  utterly refused to fit into the facts. Like everything else, alas, a  story also gets stale and the glory of the teller suffers likewise; that  is why he has to add fresh colouring every time to keep up its  freshness.    After my return from the hills I was the principal speaker at my  mother's open air gatherings on the roof terrace in the evenings. The  temptation to become famous in the eyes of one's mother is as difficult  to resist as such fame is easy to earn. While I was at the Normal  School, when I first came across the information in some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#13)"],[1,", \"To the  desert!\" and, turning their horses, they galloped away, passed the foot  of the Pyramids, and out into the desert, where they halted, seeing that  once out of reach of the fire of the French guns, there was no fear  whatever of their being pursued.    \"It is the will of Allah,\" the sheik said, as he and his party  dismounted. \"Truly you were right, friend Edgar; we know not how to  fight. Who could have dreamt that men on foot could have withstood the  charge of five thousand horsemen? And yet the Mamelukes fought, as  always, bravely.\"    \"They did indeed, sheik,\" Edgar agreed. \"They did all that was possible  for men to do, but against such a fire of infantry and artillery  horsemen are powerless. Had our infantry been as well trained as those  of the French, and instead of remaining in the entrenchments, where they  could render no assistance whatever, marched against the French infantry  and broken their squares, the Mamelukes would then have been able to  dash down upon them, and not a French soldier would ever have reached  their ships again; but without infantry the horsemen could do nothing.\"    \"Then you think that all is lost, Edgar?\"    \"Assuredly all is lost for the present, sheik. Mourad Bey and the party  with him may get away, but the rest are penned in between the French and  the river, and few of them will escape. As for the infantry, they are a  mere mob, and even if they get away they will never venture to stand  against the French. Napoleon will enter Cairo to-morrow, and there he  will remain. Numbers of horses will fall into the hands of the French.  They will take many more in Cairo, and before long they will have  cavalry as well as infantry, and then no part of the country will be  safe from them.\"    \"Then is Egypt to fall altogether under the rule of the French?\"    \"Only for a time. Our fleet will soon return, and their troops here will  be cut off from their country. They may remain here for some time, but  at last they will have to go. I think that we shall send an army out to  fight against them. We shall know what their strength is, and that they  cannot be reinforced; and they will find in the long run that although  they may have captured Egypt, they are themselves but prisoners.\"    \"And what would you advise?\" the sheik asked. \"You understand the ways  and customs of the Franks, while I know no more than a little child.  Thus, you see, in this matter you are the graybeard and I but a boy.  Therefore speak freely what you think will be best.\"    \"Then I should say, sheik, that your best course would be to return at  once to your oasis. The French army will doubtless remain near Cairo.  They will send cavalry and light artillery over the country, to search  out their enemies, and to reduce all to obedience. Around Alexandria all  will be quiet, and so long as French convoys are not attacked, the force  there is not likely to interfere with peaceable people. If you return  there you will live unmolested. You can wait and see how matters go. If  there is any great rising against the French, it will be open to you to  take part in it, but at present hostilities against the French would  only bring down their vengeance. It may be that the Arabs in the great  oasis to the west will continue the war, but in the end they will be  sure to suffer by so doing.\"    \"I think that your advice is good,\" the sheik said. \"Sidi and you shall  return home at once with half my followers. I will ride at daybreak with  the other half. In one long day's ride I shall reach the spot where the  women and baggage have gone, and I will escort them back. The road will  certainly be safe from the Franks, who will, for some time, be occupied  with Cairo, though it is hardly likely that the town will resist.  Ibrahim, after the destruction of the Mamelukes and the defeat of the  army, cannot hope to resist a great attack; for the fortifications, like  those of Alexandria, have been suffered to decay, and the French would  assuredly soon force an entrance. However, after the march that they  have made they will need rest, and for a time the roads will be safe.  But this is not so with regard to the Arabs. The whole country will be  in confusion, and an unarmed caravan might well be plundered by any  party of Arabs who met it, though they would not interfere with it were  it headed by a sheik with armed followers. Therefore I will go to fetch  them. My son will ride fast, and take possession again of our home, lest  some of our neighbours, finding it deserted, should occupy it, and then  trouble would follow.\"    Accordingly, the next morning at daybreak the troop divided and rode off  in different directions. The greater part of the gathering had scattered  the evening before, and determined to return home and wait events. Four  days' rapid travelling took Sidi and his companions back to the oasis,  which they found exactly as they had left it, the tribes in the  neighbourhood having been all too busy in following the French army, and  picking up baggage left behind by the break-down of the horses, to  attend to other matters.    The next day Sidi and Edgar rode into Alexandria. Everything there was  going on as peacefully as usual; French soldiers lounging about the  streets, a number of labourers, under the direction of French officers,  were at work restoring the fortifications on the sea face of the town,  the shops were all open, the markets were as well supplied as usual. To  Edgar's surprise a good many French sailors were to be seen in the  streets.    \"Their fleet cannot have sailed,\" he said to Sidi. \"Let us ride out  through the East gate to Ramleh. It may be, of course, that there is a  despatch-boat lying in the port, though I did not see one. I can hardly  fancy that the French admiral would have kept his fleet here, for Nelson  must sooner or later get the news of what has taken place, and it is  certain that when he does he will hurry back at full speed.\"    From the elevation of Ramleh, however, the French fleet could be made  out, lying in Aboukir Bay in a long line.    \"Hurrah!\" Edgar exclaimed; \"there they are. I mean to see this battle,  Sidi, if I have to stop here a month. It cannot be long before Nelson  arrives. I cannot think why the French admiral should have risked being  caught in a trap like this, when a defeat would cut the French army off  from Europe altogether.\"    \"But what will you do?\"    \"I shall go into the town, and buy three or four of your Arab blankets,  and put up a little tent here.\"    \"I will share it with you,\" Sidi replied. \"I will send one of our two  men back and tell him to return with two more. There will be four of  them to look after the horses, and to fetch things out from the town as  we may require them. I should like to see the battle too; it must be  something terrible to hear the noise of so many great cannon.\"    The inaction of the French has never been satisfactorily explained.  Admiral Brueys bore a high reputation as a sailor. He was a personal  friend and possessed the complete confidence of Bonaparte. The latter  had given him the strictest injunctions to sail for Toulon as soon as he  had completed the discharge of the stores that he had on board. Instead  of doing this, however, he anchored in Aboukir Bay, and there waited. It  may have been that he feared that Napoleon might never reach Cairo, or  that he might be defeated in a great battle there, and that it might be  necessary for him to return to the port and to re-embark his army. No  other explanation is possible of his delay in carrying out the  imperative orders that he had received.    After the despatch of the messenger the two friends rode along the shore  until they could not only make out the exact position of the French  fleet, but count the guns in the broadsides of each vessel. It consisted  of thirteen line-of-battle ships, comprising the flag-ship the _Orient_,  of 120 guns, three of 80, and nine of 74, together with four frigates,  four mortar vessels, and a number of gun-boats, while on an island ahead  of the line was a battery of guns and mortars. Many parties of Arabs  were riding about on the shore, and there were several of their  encampments. Some had been attracted to the spot from a considerable  distance in order to view the great vessels of which reports had reached  them, others again were simply there from the spirit of restlessness  that pervaded the population.    The news of the battle of the Pyramids had not yet arrived, and all were  in suspense. The belief that the Mamelukes would defeat the French was  all but universal. Had this taken place the whole of the Arab tribes  would at once have harassed the retreat of the defeated army, and with  the Mamelukes pressing upon them it is probable that not a single  Frenchman would have reached the sea. As Edgar and his friend were  watching the French fleet a vessel was seen over the spit of sand. She  was some three miles out at sea.    \"There is another of their ships of war, Sidi. I wonder whether she has  been scouting along the coast to gather news as to where our fleet may  be at present?\"    When she came abreast of the extremity of the bay she changed her course  and bore closer in.    \"She is coming in to join the others. I wonder what news she brings?\"    When, however, she approached within two miles of the French fleet she  again changed her course, and bore along parallel with the coast.    \"I suppose she is going into Alexandria. She hasn't got any colours  flying. That is curious, too; all the ships here are flying theirs.  Look! there are men at the mast-heads of several of the ships examining  her with telescopes. That is curious, too, for she is not signalling.  There she is, turning again and making out to sea. Perhaps she is a  British ship sent on ahead by Nelson to discover the position of the  French. If it is so we shall most likely have the fleet here to-morrow.  Then we"]]]
