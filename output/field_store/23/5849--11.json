[Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE HOG, THE GOAT, AND THE  SHEEP.      A goat, a sheep, and a fat hog,  On the same cart were bound for the fair.  They lay as quietly as any log,  But were not seeking their amusement there.  They were to be sold, so says the story.  The carter, who his business knows,  Don't take them into town to see the _shows_.  Dame porker was inclined to squeal,  As though the butcher's knife she 'gan to feel.  Her grunts, and squeals, and cries  Were loud enough to deafen one,  The other animals more wise,  And better tempered, with surprise  Exclaimed, \"have done!\"  The carter to the porker turned,  \"Where have you manners learned,  Why stun us all? Do you not see  That you're the noisiest of the three?  That sheep says not a word,  Nor can the young goat's voice be heard.\"  \"But,\" said the hog, \"they both are fools.  If like me they knew their fate,  They'd halloo out at greater rate,  The goat will only lose her milk,  The sheep his wool, but here, poor me,  I'm to be eaten, and know my destiny.\"  The porker was quite right,  But hallooing with all her might,  Was all too late,  And could not alter her sad fate.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE DELICATE HERON.      By the bank of a river,    A heron walked out,  And in it were sporting,    Pike, mackerel and trout.    Now these fish with great ease,    Our bird might have caught,  But I'll wait till I'm hungry    The silly bird thought.    At last came his appetite,    \"Now I'll eat,\" the bird cries,  And some tench from the bottom,    Just then he saw rise.    \"But these are not good enough    At this time of day,\"  And he waited for better    Till all swam away.    At eve almost starved    When all other means fail,  He was right glad to sup    On a poor little snail.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BLACKAMOOR AND HER  MISTRESS.      A foolish young lady,    Took one of her maids,  Who chanced to be black    As the ace of spades,  And said she'd have her washed white,    By the other maids;  She was put in a tub,    And with water and towels  Her skin they did rub,    Through a long summer day till the night;  But the more they did rub her,    The blacker she got;  And while they did scrub her,    She mourned her hard lot.  So the maids threw away    All their labor and care,  And the mistress gave up    Her fine scheme in despair.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BEAR AND THE GARDENER.      A bear and gardener,    Who mutually tired  Of solitary life,    And were inspired,  With a warm friendship for each other,  Promised to be to one another,  Excellent friends, and so they were.  As for the death of the poor man  I'll tell you how it happened,  If I can.  The bear watching the gardener in his sleep--  Beholding on his head a fly,  And thinking it bad company,  Took up a stone and dropped it down,  Upon the fly 'tis true,  But broke the gardener's crown.      MORAL.    To make our fortunes or to mend,  A most malignant enemy  Is better than a foolish friend.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE VULTURES AND THE  PIGEONS.      The wing'd inhabitants of air  Waged on a time a direful war.  Not those, in budding groves who sing,  To usher in the amorous spring;  Nor those, with Venus' car who fly  Through the light clouds and yielding sky  But the rapacious vulture brood,  With crooked beak that thirsts for blood,  And iron fangs. Their war, 'tis said,  For a dog's carrion corse was made.  Shrill shrieks resound from shore to shore;  The earth beneath is sanguin'd o'er;  Versed in the science to destroy,  Address and valor they employ.  'Twould take a hundred tongues to tell,  The heroes from the air who fell.  The dovecote race, a gentle nation,  Made offers of their mediation.  Prudent ambassadors are sent;  The vultures with the terms content,  Agree their guarantee to take,  And armistice and treaty make.  This kind desire to interfere,  Cost the poor peace-makers full dear.  To rapine bred, the ruthless crew,  Nor gratitude nor faith who knew,  On the defenceless pigeons fall,  And shortly had devoured them all.      MORAL.    When tyrants from their quarrels cease,  Some weaker neighbor pays their peace.  His safety in their warfare lies;  Their feuds, not he should compromise.  When Joseph, Frederick, and Kate,  Tired of unprofitable hate,  Their animosities would heel,  They swallowed Poland at a meal.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BEAR AND THE BEES.      A bear once rambled from his home,  Chanced through a garden trim to roam,  Where, 'neath the shelter of the trees,  The farmer had his hives of bees.  Bruin loved honey. \"Now,\" said he,  \"I'll rob your store-house, Master Bee.  You'll buz, and hum about my ears,  But noise a brave bear never fears.\"  So saying, bear o'erturns a hive,  And straight the air is all alive,  With angry enemies, who sting  As well as buz; and make bear sing,  A lively tune of growls and roars,  And cover him with smarting sores.

Please reserve your books, and don't despair of my  being able to make them mine. If I succeed in that, I am superior to  Crassus in wealth and look down on everybody's manors and pastures.[41]    [Footnote 40: The annalist C. Licinius Macer was impeached _de  repetundis_ (he was praetor about B.C. 70 or 69, and afterwards had a  province), and finding that he was going to be condemned, committed  suicide. He was never therefore condemned regularly (Val. Max. ix. 127;  Plut. _Cic._ 9). Cicero presided at the court as praetor.]    [Footnote 41: The books must have been a very valuable collection, or  Cicero would hardly have made so much of being able to buy them,  considering his lavish orders for statues or antiques.]          X (A I, 1)      [Sidenote: B.C. 65. Coss., L. Aurelius Cotta, L. Manlius Torquatus.]         The election to the consulship is not till the next year (B.C. 64),       but Cicero is already making preparation for it, and looking out       for support. In July his only son was born. He does not refer to       the so-called \"first Catilinarian conspiracy,\" but mentions       Catiline as a possible competitor, and even contemplates defending       him on some charge brought against him to prevent his standing for       the consulship.      TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME, JULY    [Sidenote: B.C. 65, AET. 41]    The state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I know that  you are supremely interested, is this, as far as can be as yet  conjectured. The only person actually canvassing is P. Sulpicius  Galba.[42] He meets with a good old-fashioned refusal without reserve or  disguise. In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not  unfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally give as a reason  for their refusal that they are under obligations to me. So I hope my  prospects are to a certain degree improved by the report getting about  that my friends are found to be numerous. My intention was to begin my  own canvass just at the very time that Cincius[43] tells me that your  servant starts with this letter, namely, in the _campus_ at the time of  the tribunician elections on the 17th of July. My fellow candidates, to  mention only those who seem certain, are Galba and Antonius and Q.  Cornificius.[44] At this I imagine you smiling or sighing. Well, to make  you positively smite your forehead, there _are_ people who actually  think that Caesonius[45] will stand. I don't think Aquilius will, for he  openly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his  leading position at the bar. Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if  you can imagine a jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon. As  for Aufidius and Palicanus,[46] I don't think you will expect to hear  from me about them. Of the candidates for this year's election Caesar is  considered certain. Thermus is looked upon as the rival of Silanus.[47]  These latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems  _pas impossible_ to bring in Curius over their heads. But no one else  thinks so. What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should get  in with Caesar. For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if  left over to my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the  fact that he is commissioner of the _via Flaminia_, and when that has  been finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected  consul this election.[48] Such in outline is the position of affairs in  regard to candidates up to date. For myself I shall take the greatest  pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul  seems to have a considerable voting power, as soon as business at Rome  has come to a standstill I shall obtain a _libera legatio_ and make an  excursion in the course of September to visit Piso,[49] but so as not to  be back later than January. When I have ascertained the feelings of the  nobility I will write you word. Everything else I hope will go smoothly,  at any rate while my competitors are such as are now in town. You must  undertake to secure for me the _entourage_ of our friend Pompey, since  you are nearer than I. Tell him I shall not be annoyed if he doesn't  come to my election.[50] So much for that business. But there is a  matter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive me. Your  uncle Caecilius having been defrauded of a large sum of money by P.  Varius, began an action against his cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the  property which (as he alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a  collusive sale. He was joined in this action by the other creditors,  among whom were Lucullus and P. Scipio, and the man whom they thought  would be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius  Pontius; though it is ridiculous to be talking about a receiver at this  stage in the proceedings. Caecilius asked me to appear for him against  Satyrus. Now, scarcely a day passes that Satyrus does not call at my  house. The chief object of his attentions is L. Domitius,[51] but I am  next in his regard. He has been of great service both to myself and to  my brother Quintus in our elections. I was very much embarrassed by my  intimacy with Satyrus as well as that with Domitius, on whom the success  of my election depends more than on anyone else. I pointed out these  facts to Caecilius; at the same time I assured him that if the case had  been one exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I would have done what  he wished. As the matter actually stood, all the creditors being  concerned--and that too men of the highest rank, who, without the aid of  anyone specially retained by Caecilius, would have no difficulty in  maintaining their common cause--it was only fair that he should have  consideration both for my private friendship and my present situation.  He seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than I could have  wished, or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that time forth he  has entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me, which was only of a  few day's standing.[52] Pray forgive me, and believe that I was  prevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the reputation  of a friend in so vital a point at a time of such very great distress,  considering that he had shewn me every sort of kindness and attention.  But if you incline to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that the  interests of my canvass prevented me. Yet, even granting that to be so,  I think you should pardon me, \"since not for sacred beast or oxhide  shield.\"[53] You see in fact the position I am in, and how necessary I  regard it, not only to retain but even to acquire all possible sources  of popularity. I hope I have justified myself in your eyes, I am at any  rate anxious to have done so. The Hermathena you sent I am delighted  with: it has been placed with such charming effect that the whole  gymnasium seems arranged specially for it.[54] I am exceedingly obliged  to you.    [Footnote 42: One of the judices rejected by Verres on his trial, a  pontifex and augur.]    [Footnote 43: Agent of Atticus.]    [Footnote 44: C. Antonius (uncle of M. Antonius) was elected with  Cicero. Q. Cornificius had been tr. pl. in B.C. 69. See Letter XVIII.]    [Footnote 45: M. Caesonius, Cicero's colleague in the aedileship. He had  lost credit as one of the _Iunianum concilium_ in the trial of  Oppianicus.]    [Footnote 46: Aufidius Lurco, tr. pl. B.C. 61. M. Lollius Palicanus, tr.  pl. some years previously.]    [Footnote 47: L. Iulius Caesar, actually consul in B.C. 64,  brother-in-law of Lentulus the Catilinarian conspirator, was afterwards  _legatus_ to his distant kinsman, Iulius Caesar, in Gaul. A. Minucius  Thermus, defended by Cicero in B.C. 59, but the identification is not  certain. D. Iunius Silanus got the consulship in the year after Cicero  (B.C. 62), and as consul-designate spoke in favour of executing the  Catilinarian conspirators.]    [Footnote 48: The text is corrupt in all MSS. I have assumed a reading,  something of this sort, _quae cum erit absoluta, sane facile ac libenter  eum nunc fieri consulem viderim_. This at any rate gives nearly the  required sense, which is that Cicero regards the influence which Thermus  will gain by managing the repair of the _Flaminia_ as likely to make him  a formidable candidate, and therefore he would be glad to see him  elected in the present year 65 (_nunc_) rather than wait for the next,  his own year.]    [Footnote 49: C. Calpurnis Piso, consul in B.C. 67, then proconsul of  Gallia Transalpina (Narbonensis). He was charged with embezzlement in  his province and defended by Cicero in B.C. 63. There were no votes in  Transalpine Gaul, but Cicero means in going and coming to canvass the  Cispadane cities.]    [Footnote 50: Pompey was this year on his way to take over the  Mithridatic War. But Cicero may have thought it likely that he or some  of his staff would pass through Athens and meet Atticus.]    [Footnote 51: L.
