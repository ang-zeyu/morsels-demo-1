So were a great many speeches  uttered by senators and members of the House, and those bodies too often  acted upon them.    It is therefore but repeating recorded history to say that Mr. Johnson  was earnestly seeking to carry out Mr. Lincoln's plan of reconstruction,  which was upon consultation with his entire Cabinet, more especially  with Mr. Stanton, adopted by him as the basis for the restoration of the  revolted States.    Yet, with these facts of record, that action was afterwards assailed  by the Republican leaders in and out of Congress, who assumed to have  become Mr. Lincoln's executors in the work of reconstruction, as not  only an abandonment of the plan instituted by him, but a surrender  of the issues fought out and the results accomplished by the war just  closed notwithstanding very many of these critics of Mr. Johnson had but  a few months before criticised Mr. Lincoln with quite equal severity for  his suggestion of this same method of restoration.    Nor will it suffice to say that, though professing submission and  loyalty, the people of the South were still hostile to the Union, and  that there was no safety there for Union men. It is true that there came  to be violence and disorder there upon the rejection by Congress of Mr.  Johnson's plan of restoration.    These were the inevitable results of the conditions. There would also  have been disorder and violence in the North and to a far greater  degree, had the results of the war been reversed--an arbitrary and  tyrannical system of restoration insisted upon--the established order of  things destroyed homes broken up the people impoverished, and hordes  of unscrupulous adventurers swarmed up from the South and overrun  the country in pursuit of schemes of political chicanery and personal  ambition, peculation and plunder, as was the South after the close of  the war.    But when the fight was on, an overwhelmingly partisan House, as a last  resort, in the hope of at once ending, by removal, all opposition on  the part of the President to the views and aims of the dominant party  in Congress, resorted to the first project of impeachment set out in the  succeeding chapter.        CHAPTER IV. --  FIRST ATTEMPT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT.    THE ASHLEY INDICTMENT.    The initiation of formal proceedings for the impeachment and removal of  President Johnson occurred in the House of Representatives on January  7th, 1867, in the introduction of three separate resolutions for his  impeachment, by Messrs. Loan and Kelso, of Missouri, and Mr. Ashley of  Ohio. As Mr. Ashley's Resolution was the only one acted on by the House,  only the proceedings had thereon are here given, as follows:    Mr. Speaker:--I rise to perform a painful but, nevertheless, to me, an  imperative duty; a duty which I think ought not longer to be postponed,  and which cannot, without criminality on our part, be neglected. I had  hoped, sir, that this duty would have devolved upon an older and more  experienced member of this House than myself. Prior to our adjournment I  asked a number of gentlemen to offer the resolution which I introduced,  but upon which I failed to obtain a suspension of the rules.    Confident, sir, that the loyal people of this country demand the  adoption of some such proposition as I am about to submit, I am  determined that no effort on my part shall be wanting to see that their  expectations are not disappointed. * * * On my responsibility as a  Representative, and in the presence of this House, and before the  American people, I charge Andrew Johnson, Vice President and acting  President of the United States, with the commission of acts which in  contemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes and misdemeanors, for  which, in my judgment, he ought to be impeached. I therefore submit the  following:    I do impeach Andrew Johnson, Vice President and acting President of the  United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors:    I charge him with a usurpation of power and violation of law:    In that he has corruptly used the appointing power;    In that he has corruptly used the pardoning power;    In that he has corruptly used the veto power;    In that he has corruptly disposed of public property of the United  States;    In that he has corruptly interfered in elections, and committed acts  which, in contemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes and  misdemeanors: Therefore,    BE IT RESOLVED, That the Committee on the Judiciary be, and they are  hereby, authorized to inquire into the official conduct of Andrew  Johnson, Vice President of the United States, discharging the powers and  duties of the office of President of the United States, and to report to  this House, whether, in their opinion, the said Andrew Johnson, while in  said office, has been guilty of acts which are designed or calculated to  overthrow, subvert, or corrupt the Government of the United States, or  any department or office thereof; and whether the said Andrew Johnson  has been guilty of any act, or has conspired with others to do acts,  which, in contemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes and  misdemeanors, requiring the interposition of the constitutional power of  this House; and that said committee have power to send for persons and  papers, and to administer the customary oath to witnesses.    The question was taken on agreeing to the Resolution; and it was decided  in the affirmative--yeas 107, nays 39, not voting 45.    On the 2nd of March, 1867, the subject of impeachment again came up in  the House, and the following proceedings were had:    Mr. Wilson, of Iowa, (Rep.)--I am directed by the Committee on the  Judiciary to present a report relative to the official conduct of the  President of the United States.    Mr. Eldridge, (Dem.)--Mr. Speaker, I wish to raise a question of order:  I see by the clock that it is almost three o'clock in the morning; and  I believe this is the Sabbath day. I think we should not do any more  business tonight, except it be business of necessity or charity.    The Speaker.--This, in parliamentary view, is Saturday. The clerk will  read the report submitted by the gentleman from Iowa.    The clerk read as follows:    The Committee on the Judiciary, charged by the House with examination  of certain allegations, of high crimes and misdemeanors against the  President of the United States, submit the following report:    On the 7th day of January, 1867, the House, on the motion of the Hon.  James M. Ashley, a Representative from the State of Ohio, adopted the  following preamble and resolutions, to-wit:    The duty imposed upon this committee by this action of the House, was  of the highest and gravest character. No committee during the entire  history of the Government, has ever been charged with a more important  trust. The responsibility which it imposed was of oppressive weight,  and of a most unpleasant nature. Gladly would the committee have escaped  from the arduous labor imposed upon it by the Resolution of the House;  but once imposed, prompt, deliberate, and faithful action, with a view  to correct results, became its duty, and to this end it has directed its  efforts.    Soon after the adoption of the Resolution by the House, Hon. James M.  Ashley communicated to the committee, in support of his charges  against the President of the United States, such facts as were in his  possession, and the investigation was proceeded with, and has been  continued almost without, a day's interruption. A large number of  witnesses have been examined, many documents collected, and everything  done which could be done to reach a conclusion of the case. But the  investigation covers a broad field, embraces many novel, interesting,  and important questions, and involves a multitude of facts, while  most of the witnesses are distant from the Capital, owing to which the  committee, in view of the magnitude of the interests involved in its  action, have not been able to conclude its labors, and is not therefore  prepared to submit a definite and final report. If the investigation had  even approached completeness, the committee would not feel authorized  to present the result of the House at this late period of the session,  unless the charges had been so entirely negative as to admit of no  discussion, which, in the opinion of the committee, is not the case.    Certainly no affirmative report could be properly considered in the  expiring hours of this Congress.    The committee not having fully investigated all the charges prepared  against the President of the United States, it is deemed inexpedient to  submit any conclusion beyond the statement that sufficient testimony has  been brought to its notice to justify and demand a further prosecution  of the investigation.    The testimony which the committee has taken will pass into the custody  of the Clerk of the House, and can go into the hands of such committee  as may be charged with the duty of bringing this investigation to a  close, so that the labor expended upon it may not have been in vain.    The committee regrets its inability definitely to dispose of the  important subject committed to its charge, and presents this report for  its own justification, and for the additional purpose of notifying the  succeeding Congress of the incompleteness of its labors, and that they  should be completed.    James F. Wilson, Chairman. Francis Thomas, D. Morris, F. E. Woodbridge,  George S. Boutwell, Thomas Williams, Burton C. Cook, William Lawrence,    Mr. Ancona, the only Democrat on the committee, presented a minority  report, as follows:    The subscriber, one of the Judiciary Committee, to which was referred by  the House the inquiry into the official conduct of His Excellency, the  President of the United States, with a view to his impeachment upon  certain charges made by Hon. James M. Ashley, begs leave to submit the  following report:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#13)"],[1," the plates were in his possession \"multitudes\" tried  to get them away from him, but that he succeeded in keeping them until  they were translated, and then delivered them again to the messenger,  who still retains them. Mother Smith tells a graphic story of attempts  to get the plates away from her son, and says that when he first  received them he hid them until the next day in a rotten birch log,  bringing them home wrapped in his linen frock under his arm.* Later, she  says, he hid them in a hole dug in the hearth of their house, and again  in a pile of flax in a cooper shop; Willard Chase's daughter almost  found them once by means of a peek-stone of her own.         * Elder Hyde in his \"Mormonism\" estimates that \"from the  description given of them the plates must have weighed nearly two  hundred pounds.\"      Mother Smith says that Joseph told all the family of his vision the  evening of the day he told his father, charging them to keep it secret,  and she adds:--    \"From that time forth Joseph continued to receive instructions from the  Lord, and we continued to get the children together every evening for  the purpose of listening while he gave us a relation of the same. I  presume our family presented an aspect as singular as any that ever  lived upon the face of the earth--all seated in a circle, father,  mother, sons, and daughters, and giving the most profound attention to  a boy eighteen years old, who had never read the Bible through in his  life.... We were now confirmed in the opinion that God was about to  bring to light something upon which we could stay our mind, or that  would give us a more perfect knowledge of the plan of salvation and the  redemption of the human family.\"        CHAPTER VI. -- TRANSLATION AND PUBLICATION OF THE BIBLE    The only one of his New York neighbors who seems to have taken a  practical interest in Joe's alleged discovery was a farmer named Martin  Harris, who lived a little north of Palmyra. Harris was a religious  enthusiast, who had been a Quaker (as his wife was still), a  Universalist, a Baptist, and a Presbyterian, and whose sanity it would  have been difficult to establish in a surrogate's court. The Rev.  Dr. Clark, who knew him intimately, says, \"He had always been a firm  believer in dreams, visions, and ghosts.\"         *Howe describes him as often declaring that he had talked with  Jesus Christ, angels, and the devil, and saying that \"Christ was the  handsomest man he ever saw, and the devil looked like a jackass, with  very short, smooth hair similar to that of a mouse.\" Daniel Hendrix  relates that as he and Harris were riding to the village one evening,  and he remarked on the beauty of the moon, Harris replied that if his  companion could only see it as he had, he might well call it beautiful,  explaining that he had actually visited the moon, and adding that  it \"was only the faithful who were permitted to visit the celestial  regions.\" Jesse Townsend, a resident of Palmyra, in a letter written in  1833, describes him as a visionary fanatic, unhappily married, who \"is  considered here to this day a brute in his domestic relations, a fool  and a dupe to Smith in religion, and an unlearned, conceited hypocrite  generally.\" His wife, in an affidavit printed in Howe's book (p. 255),  says: \"He has whipped, kicked, and turned me out of the house.\" Harris,  like Joe's mother, was a constant reader of and a literal believer in  the Bible. Tucker says that he \"could probably repeat from memory every  text from the Bible, giving the chapter and verse in each case.\" This  seems to be an exaggeration.         * \"Gleanings by the Way.\"      Mother Smith's account of Harris's early connection with the Bible  enterprise says that her husband told Harris of the existence of the  plates two or three years before Joe got possession of them; that when  Joe secured them he asked her to go and tell Harris that he wanted  to see him on the subject, an errand not to her liking, because \"Mr.  Harris's wife was a very peculiar woman,\" that is, she did not share in  her husband's superstition. Mrs. Smith did not succeed in seeing Harris,  but he soon afterward voluntarily offered Joe fifty dollars \"for the  purpose of helping Mr. Smith do the Lord's work.\" As Harris was  very \"close\" in money matters, it is probable that Joe offered him a  partnership in the scheme at the start. Harris seems to have placed  much faith in the selling quality of the new Bible. He is said to have  replied to his wife's early declaration of disbelief in it: \"What if it  is a lie. If you will let me alone I will make money out of it.\"* The  Rev. Ezra Booth said: \"Harris informed me [after his removal to Ohio]  that he went to the place where Joseph resided [in Pennsylvania], and  Joseph had given it [the translation] up on account of the opposition of  his wife and others; and he told Joseph, 'I have not come down here for  nothing, and we will go on with it.'\"**         * Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 254.         ** Ibid., p. 182.      Just at this time Joe was preparing to move to the neighborhood of  Harmony, Pennsylvania, having made a trip there after his marriage,  during which, Mr. Hale's affidavit says, \"Smith stated to me that he had  given up what he called 'glass-looking,' and that he expected to work  hard for a living and was willing to do so.\" Smith's brother-in-law  Alva, in accordance with arrangements then made, went to Palmyra and  helped move his effects to a house near Mr. Hale's. Joe acknowledges  that Harris's gift or loan of fifty dollars enabled him to meet the  expenses of moving.    Parley P. Pratt, in a statement published by him in London in 1854, set  forth that Smith was driven to Pennsylvania from Palmyra through fear of  his life, and that he took the plates with him concealed in a barrel of  beans, thus eluding the efforts of persons who tried to secure them by  means of a search warrant. Tucker says that this story rests only on  the sending of a constable after Smith by a man to whom he owed a small  debt. The great interest manifested in the plates in the neighborhood of  Palmyra existed only in Mormon imagination developed in later years.    According to some accounts, all the work of what was called  \"translating\" the writing on the plates into what became the \"Book of  Mormon\" was done at Joe's home in New York State, and most of it in a  cave, but this was not the case. Smith himself says: \"Immediately after  my arrival [in Pennsylvania] I commenced copying the characters off the  plates. I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the Urim  and Thummim I translated some of them, which I did between the time  I arrived, at the house of my wife's father in the month of December  (1827) and the February following.\"    A clear description of the work of translating as carried on in  Pennsylvania is given in the affidavit made by Smith's father-in-law,  Isaac Hale, in 1834.* He says that soon after Joe's removal to his  neighborhood with his wife, he (Hale) was shown a box such as is used  for the shipment of window glass, and was told that it contained the  \"book of plates\"; he was allowed to lift it, but not to look into it.  Joe told him that the first person who would be allowed to see the  plates would be a young child.** The affidavit continues:--         * Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 264.         ** Joe's early announcement was that his first-born child was to  have this power, but the child was born dead. This was one of the  earliest of Joe's mistakes in prophesying.      \"About this time Martin Harris made his appearance upon the stage, and  Smith began to interpret the characters, or hieroglyphics, which he  said were engraven upon the plates, while Harris wrote down the  interpretation. It was said that Harris wrote down 116 pages and lost  them. Soon after this happened, Martin Harris informed me that he must  have a GREATER WITNESS, and said that he had talked with Joseph about  it. Joseph informed him that he could not, or durst not, show him the  plates, but that he [Joseph] would go into the woods where the book of  plates was, and that after he came back Harris should follow his track  in the snow, and find the book and examine it for himself. Harris  informed me that he followed Smith's directions, and could not find the  plates and was still dissatisfied.    \"The next day after this happened I went to the house where Joseph  Smith, Jr., lived, and where he and Harris were engaged in their  translation of the book. Each of them had a written piece of paper which  they were comparing, and some of the words were, I my servant seeketh a  greater witness, but no greater witness can be given him.... I inquired  whose words they were, and was informed by Joseph or Emma (I rather  think it was the former), that they were the words of Jesus Christ. I  told them that I considered the whole of it a delusion, and advised them  to abandon it. The manner in which he pretended to read and interpret  was the same as when he looked for the moneydiggers, with the stone in  his hat and his hat over his face, while the book of plates was at the  same time hid in the woods.    \"After this, Martin Harris went away, and Oliver Cowdery came and wrote  for Smith, while he interpreted as above described.    \"Joseph Smith, Jr., resided near me for some time after this, and I  had a good opportunity of becoming acquainted with him, and somewhat  acquainted with his associates; and I conscientiously believe, from the  facts I have detailed, and from many other circumstances which I do not  deem it necessary to relate, that the whole Book of Mormon (so-called)  is a silly fabrication of falsehood and wickedness, got up for  speculation, and with a design to dupe the credulous and unwary.\"    Harris's natural shrewdness in a measure overcame his fanaticism, and he  continued to press Smith for a sight of the plates. Smith thereupon made  one of"]]]
