It's only a  little unfortunate, because your stepmother says she won't think  of our going back to America till these people here have given me  a title. She wants to put one over on her sister. That's all  that's troubling me, the thought that this affair will set us  back, this Lord Percy being in so strong with the guys who give  the titles. I guess it will mean my staying on here for a while  longer, and I'd liked to have seen another ball-game. Jimmy, do  you know they call baseball Rounders in this country, and  children play it with a soft ball!\"    Jimmy was striding up and down the little room. Remorse had him  in its grip.    \"What a damned fool I am!\"    \"Never mind, Jimmy. It's unfortunate, but it wasn't your fault.  You couldn't know.\"    \"It was my fault. Nobody but a fool like me would go about  beating people up. But don't worry, dad. It's going to be all  right. I'll fix it. I'm going right round to this fellow Percy  now to make things all right. I won't come back till I've squared  him. Don't you bother yourself about it any longer, dad. It's  going to be all right.\"        CHAPTER VI    JIMMY ABANDONS PICCADILLY    Jimmy removed himself sorrowfully from the doorstep of the Duke  of Devizes' house in Cleveland Row. His mission had been a  failure. In answer to his request to be permitted to see Lord  Percy Whipple, the butler had replied that Lord Percy was  confined to his bed and was seeing nobody. He eyed Jimmy, on  receiving his name, with an interest which he failed to conceal,  for he too, like Bayliss, had read and heartily enjoyed Bill  Blake's spirited version of the affair of last night which had  appeared in the _Daily Sun_. Indeed, he had clipped the report out  and had been engaged in pasting it in an album when the bell  rang.    In face of this repulse, Jimmy's campaign broke down. He was at a  loss to know what to do next. He ebbed away from the Duke's front  door like an army that has made an unsuccessful frontal attack on  an impregnable fortress. He could hardly force his way in and  search for Lord Percy.    He walked along Pall Mall, deep in thought. It was a beautiful  day. The rain which had fallen in the night and relieved Mr.  Crocker from the necessity of watching cricket had freshened  London up.    The sun was shining now from a turquoise sky. A gentle breeze  blew from the south. Jimmy made his way into Piccadilly, and  found that thoroughfare a-roar with happy automobilists and  cheery pedestrians. Their gaiety irritated him. He resented  their apparent enjoyment of life.    Jimmy's was not a nature that lent itself readily to  introspection, but he was putting himself now through a searching  self-examination which was revealing all kinds of unsuspected  flaws in his character. He had been having too good a time for  years past to have leisure to realise that he possessed any  responsibilities. He had lived each day as it came in the spirit  of the Monks of Thelema. But his father's reception of the news  of last night's escapade and the few words he had said had given  him pause. Life had taken on of a sudden a less simple aspect.  Dimly, for he was not accustomed to thinking along these lines,  he perceived the numbing truth that we human beings are merely as  many pieces in a jig-saw puzzle and that our every movement  affects the fortunes of some other piece. Just so, faintly at  first and taking shape by degrees, must the germ of civic spirit  have come to Prehistoric Man. We are all individualists till we  wake up.    The thought of having done anything to make his father unhappy  was bitter to Jimmy Crocker. They had always been more like  brothers than father and son. Hard thoughts about himself surged  through Jimmy's mind. With a dejectedness to which it is possible  that his headache contributed he put the matter squarely to  himself. His father was longing to return to America--he, Jimmy,  by his idiotic behaviour was putting obstacles in the way of that  return--what was the answer? The answer, to Jimmy's way of  thinking, was that all was not well with James Crocker, that,  when all the evidence was weighed, James Crocker would appear to  be a fool, a worm, a selfish waster, and a hopeless, low-down  skunk.    Having come to this conclusion, Jimmy found himself so low in  spirit that the cheerful bustle of Piccadilly was too much for  him. He turned, and began to retrace his steps. Arriving in due  course at the top of the Haymarket he hesitated, then turned down  it till he reached Cockspur Street. Here the Trans-Atlantic  steamship companies have their offices, and so it came about that  Jimmy, chancing to look up as he walked, perceived before him,  riding gallantly on a cardboard ocean behind a plate-glass  window, the model of a noble vessel. He stopped, conscious of a  curious thrill. There is a superstition in all of us. When an  accidental happening chances to fit smoothly in with a mood,  seeming to come as a direct commentary on that mood, we are apt  to accept it in defiance of our pure reason as an omen. Jimmy  strode to the window and inspected the model narrowly. The sight  of it had started a new train of thought. His heart began to  race. Hypnotic influences were at work on him.    Why not? Could there be a simpler solution of the whole trouble?    Inside the office he would see a man with whiskers buying a  ticket for New York. The simplicity of the process fascinated  him. All you had to do was to walk in, bend over the counter  while the clerk behind it made dabs with a pencil at the  illustrated plate of the ship's interior organs, and hand over  your money. A child could do it, if in funds. At this thought his  hand strayed to his trouser-pocket. A musical crackling of  bank-notes proceeded from the depths. His quarterly allowance had  been paid to him only a short while before, and, though a willing  spender, he still retained a goodly portion of it. He rustled the  notes again. There was enough in that pocket to buy three tickets  to New York. Should he? . . . Or, on the other hand--always look  on both sides of the question--should he not?    It would certainly seem to be the best thing for all parties if  he did follow the impulse. By remaining in London he was injuring  everybody, himself included. . . . Well, there was no harm in  making enquiries. Probably the boat was full up anyway. . . . He  walked into the office.    \"Have you anything left on the _Atlantic_ this trip?\"    The clerk behind the counter was quite the wrong sort of person  for Jimmy to have had dealings with in his present mood. What  Jimmy needed was a grave, sensible man who would have laid a hand  on his shoulder and said \"Do nothing rash, my boy!\" The clerk  fell short of this ideal in practically every particular. He was  about twenty-two, and he seemed perfectly enthusiastic about the  idea of Jimmy going to America. He beamed at Jimmy.    \"Plenty of room,\" he said. \"Very few people crossing. Give you  excellent accommodation.\"    \"When does the boat sail?\"    \"Eight to-morrow morning from Liverpool. Boat-train leaves  Paddington six to-night.\"    Prudence came at the eleventh hour to check Jimmy. This was not a  matter, he perceived, to be decided recklessly, on the spur of a  sudden impulse. Above all, it was not a matter to be decided  before lunch. An empty stomach breeds imagination. He had  ascertained that he could sail on the _Atlantic_ if he wished to.  The sensible thing to do now was to go and lunch and see how he  felt about it after that. He thanked the clerk, and started to  walk up the Haymarket, feeling hard-headed and practical, yet  with a strong premonition that he was going to make a fool of  himself just the same.    It was half-way up the Haymarket that he first became conscious  of the girl with the red hair.    Plunged in thought, he had not noticed her before. And yet she  had been walking a few paces in front of him most of the way. She  had come out of Panton Street, walking briskly, as one going to  keep a pleasant appointment. She carried herself admirably, with  a jaunty swing.    Having become conscious of this girl, Jimmy, ever a warm admirer  of the sex, began to feel a certain interest stealing over him.  With interest came speculation. He wondered who she was. He  wondered where she had bought that excellently fitting suit of  tailor-made grey. He admired her back, and wondered whether her  face, if seen, would prove a disappointment. Thus musing, he drew  near to the top of the Haymarket, where it ceases to be a street  and becomes a whirlpool of rushing traffic. And here the girl,  having paused and looked over her shoulder, stepped off the  sidewalk. As she did so a taxi-cab rounded the corner quickly  from the direction of Coventry Street.    The agreeable surprise of finding the girl's face fully as  attractive as her back had stimulated Jimmy, so that he was keyed  up for the exhibition of swift presence-of-mind. He jumped  forward and caught her arm, and swung her to one side as the cab  rattled past, its driver thinking hard thoughts to himself. The  whole episode was an affair of seconds.    \"Thank you,\" said the girl.    She rubbed the arm which he had seized with rather a rueful  expression. She was a little white, and her breath came quickly.    \"I hope I didn't hurt you,\" said Jimmy.    \"You did. Very much. But the taxi would have hurt me more.\"    She laughed. She looked very attractive when she laughed. She had  a small, piquant, vivacious face. Jimmy, as he looked at it, had  an odd feeling that he had seen her before--when and where he did  not know. That mass of red-gold hair seemed curiously familiar.  Somewhere in the hinterland of his mind there lurked a memory,  but he could not bring it into the open. As for the girl, if she  had ever met him before, she showed no signs of recollecting it.  Jimmy decided that, if he had seen her, it must have been in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#13)"],[1,"into a duplicate  embrace; and Nature rejoices over one more marriage and over three more  births.\"          Section 14.  How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland        Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures  to the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to  him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things  in Flatland.  So I began thus: \"How does your Royal Highness  distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects?  I for my part  noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some  of your people are Lines and others Points, and that some of the Lines  are larger--\" \"You speak of an impossibility,\" interrupted the King;  \"you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a  Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the  nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of  hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained.  Behold me--I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of  Space--\"  \"Of Length\", I ventured to suggest.  \"Fool,\" said he, \"Space  is Length.  Interrupt me again, and I have done.\"    I apologized; but he continued scornfully, \"Since you are impervious to  argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I  reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles  seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the  other to the South.  Listen, I call to them.\"    He chirruped, and then complacently continued:  \"My wives at this  moment receiving the sound of one of my voices, closely followed by the  other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in  which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is  6.457 inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my  shape to be 6.457 inches.  But you will of course understand that my  wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices.  They made it, once for all, before we were married.  But they COULD  make it at any time.  And in the same way I can estimate the shape of  any of my Male subjects by the sense of sound.\"    \"But how,\" said I, \"if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his two  voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized  as the echo of the Northern?  May not such deceptions cause great  inconvenience?  And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind  by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?\"  This of  course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered  the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I  succeeded perfectly.    \"What!\" cried he in horror, \"explain your meaning.\"  \"Feel, touch, come  into contact,\" I replied.  \"If you mean by FEELING,\" said the King,  \"approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals,  know, Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by  death.  And the reason is obvious.  The frail form of a Woman, being  liable to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by  the State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of  sight from Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman  shall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the  approximator and the approximated.    \"And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal and  unnatural excess of approximation which you call TOUCHING, when all the  ends of so brutal and coarse a process are attained at once more easily  and more exactly by the sense of hearing?  As to your suggested danger  of deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of  one's Being, cannot be thus changed at will.  But come, suppose that I  had the power of passing through solid things, so that I could  penetrate my subjects, one after another, even to the number of a  billion, verifying the size and distance of each by the sense of  FEELING:  how much time and energy would be wasted in this clumsy and  inaccurate method!  Whereas now, in one moment of audition, I take as  it were the census and statistics, local, corporeal, mental and  spiritual, of every living being in Lineland.  Hark, only hark!\"    So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound which  seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable  multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers.    \"Truly,\" replied I, \"your sense of hearing serves you in good stead,  and fills up many of your deficiencies.  But permit me to point out  that your life in Lineland must be deplorably dull.  To see nothing but  a Point!  Not even to be able to contemplate a Straight Line!  Nay, not  even to know what a Straight Line is!  To see, yet be cut off from  those Linear prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland!  Better  surely to have no sense of sight at all than to see so little!  I grant  you I have not your discriminative faculty of hearing; for the concert  of all Lineland which gives you such intense pleasure, is to me no  better than a multitudinous twittering or chirping.  But at least I can  discern, by sight, a Line from a Point.  And let me prove it.  Just  before I came into your kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right,  and then from right to left, with Seven Men and a Woman in your  immediate proximity on the left, and eight Men and two Women on your  right.  Is not this correct?\"    \"It is correct,\" said the King, \"so far as the numbers and sexes are  concerned, though I know not what you mean by 'right' and 'left'.  But  I deny that you saw these things.  For how could you see the Line, that  is to say the inside, of any Man?  But you must have heard these  things, and then dreamed that you saw them.  And let me ask what you  mean by those words 'left' and 'right'.  I suppose it is your way of  saying Northward and Southward.\"    \"Not so,\" replied I; \"besides your motion of Northward and Southward,  there is another motion which I call from right to left.\"    KING.  Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.    I.  Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line  altogether.    KING.  Out of my Line?  Do you mean out of the world?  Out of Space?    I.  Well, yes.  Out of YOUR World.  Out of YOUR Space.  For your Space  is not the true Space.  True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a  Line.    KING.  If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by  yourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.    I.  If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no  words of mine can make my meaning clear to you.  But surely you cannot  be ignorant of so simple a distinction.    KING.  I do not in the least understand you.    I.  Alas!  How shall I make it clear?  When you move straight on, does  it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way,  turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which  your side is now fronting?  In other words, instead of always moving in  the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to  move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?    KING.  Never.  And what do you mean?  How can a man's inside \"front\" in  any direction?  Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?    I.  Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,  and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire  to indicate to you.    At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland.  As long as any  part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept  exclaiming, \"I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.\"  But when  I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest  voice, \"She is vanished; she is dead.\"  \"I am not dead,\" replied I; \"I  am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line  which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as  they are.  And at this moment I can see your Line, or side--or inside  as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on  the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate, describing their  order, their size, and the interval between each.\"      [Illustration 7]    [ASCII approximation follows]                  My body just before I disappeared                        +---------+                        |\\ \\ \\ \\ \\|                        |\\ \\ \\ \\ \\|                        |\\ \\ \\ \\ \\|    Lineland ---->      |\\ \\ \\ \\ \\|              The King    --------------------+---------+--------------========      When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, \"Does that  at last convince you?\"  And, with that, I once more entered Lineland,  taking up the same position as before.    But the Monarch replied, \"If you were a Man of sense--though, as you  appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but  a Woman--but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to  reason.  You ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that  which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am  daily conscious.  I, in return, ask you to describe in words or  indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak.  Instead of  moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning  to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your new World, you  simply tell me the numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts  known to any child in my capital.  Can anything be more irrational or  audacious?  Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions.\"    Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed  to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, \"Besotted  Being!
