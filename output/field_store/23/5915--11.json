We shall only give in each class a few verbs to illustrate the gradation  of vowels and consonant changes. All other verbs occurring in the texts  will be found in the Glossary referred to their proper class.      CLASS I.    Sec. 76.    The verbs of this class belong to the first ablaut-series (Sec. 12) and  therefore have {[i]} in all forms of the present; {ei} in the first and  third pers. sing. of the preterite, but {[e]} before {ch} (= Germanic {h},  Sec. 23), and finally (Sec. 17); and {i} in the preterite plural and past  participle, thus:--      b[i]ten, _to wait_        beit   biten   gebiten    sw[i]gen, _to be silent_  sweic  swigen  geswigen    tr[i]ben, _to drive_      treip  triben  getriben    And similarly {bel[i]ben}, _to remain_, {b[i][z]en}, _to bite_, {r[i]ben}, _to  rub_, {r[i]ten}, _to ride_, {sch[i]nen}, _to shine_, {schr[i]ben}, _to write_,  {s[i]gen}, _to sink_, {str[i]ten}, _to quarrel_.      sn[i]den, _to cut_    sneit   sniten         gesniten    d[i]hen, _to thrive_  d[e]ch    digen          gedigen    r[i]sen, _to fall_    reis    rirn (risen)   gerirn (gerisen)    And similarly {l[i]den}, _to suffer_, {m[i]den}, _to avoid_, {n[i]den}, _to  envy_, {l[i]hen}, _to lend_, {z[i]hen}, _to accuse_. See Sec. 30.      Sec. 77.    The following two verbs which are also used as weak verbs have mixed  forms in the preterite and past participle:--      schr[i]en, _to scream_  schr[e]   schriuwen  geschriuwen                          schrei  schr[u]wen   geschr[u]wen                                  schrirn    geschrirn    sp[i]wen, _to vomit_    sp[e]     spiwen     gespiwen                          spei    spiuwen    gespiuwen                                  sp[u]wen     gesp[u]wen                                  spirn      gespirn      CLASS II.    Sec. 78.    The verbs of this class belong to the second ablaut-series (Sec. 12) and  therefore have {ie} in the present, but {iu} in the present singular  (Sec. 16); {ou} in the first and third pers. sing. of the preterite, but {[o]}  before {t, [z], s} and {ch} (= Germanic {h}), Sec. 18; {u} in the pret.  plural; and {o} in the past participle, thus:--      biegen, _to bend_      biuge     bouc    bugen      gebogen    triefen, _to drop_     triufe    trouf   truffen    getroffen    bieten, _to offer_     biute     b[o]t     buten      geboten    schie[z]en, _to shoot_   schiu[z]e   sch[o][z]   schu[zz]en   gescho[zz]en    And similarly {klieben}, _to cleave_, {kriechen}, _to creep_, {liegen},  _to lie_, {riechen}, _to smell_, {schieben}, _to shove_, {vliegen}, _to  fly_; {die[z]en}, _to roar_, {gie[z]en}, _to pour_, {vlie[z]en}, _to flow_.      sieden, _to seethe_  siude  s[o]t   suten  gesoten    ziehen, _to draw_    ziuhe  z[o]ch  zugen  gezogen    kiesen, _to choose_  kius   k[o]s   kurn   gekorn    And similarly {vliehen}, _to flee_, {niesen}, _to sneeze_, {verliesen},  _to lose_, {vriesen}, _to freeze_. See Sec. 30.      Sec. 79.    On the stem-vowels in the following verbs, see Sec. 16, note and Sec. 36:--      bliuwen, _to strike_  bliuwe  blou  bl[u]wen                                        bliuwen   gebliuwen                                        blouwen   geblouwen    And similarly {briuwen}, _to brew_, {kiuwen}, _to chew_, {riuwen}, _to  pain_.      Sec. 80.    To this class also belong the three aorist presents:--      l[u]chen, _to shut_       liuche    louch  luchen  gelochen                             (l[u]che)    s[u]fen, _to gulp down_   s[u]fe      souf   suffen  gesoffen    s[u]gen, _to suck_        s[u]ge      souc   sugen   gesogen      CLASS III.    Sec. 81.    The verbs of this class belong to the third ablaut-series (Sec. 12), and  include the strong verbs having a medial nasal or a liquid + consonant.  Those with nasal + consonant have {i} throughout the present tense and  {u} in the past participle; the others have {i} in the present singular,  {[e:]} in the plural, and {o} in the past participle (see Secs. 14, 15),  thus:--      binden, _to bind_  binde   bant   bunden   gebunden    rinnen, _to run_   rinne   ran    runnen   gerunnen    singen, _to sing_  singe   sanc   sungen   gesungen    And similarly {brinnen}, _to burn_, {dringen}, _to press_, {entrinnen},  _to escape_, {gelingen}, _to succeed_, {gewinnen}, _to gain_,  {schrinden}, _to split_, {sinken}, _to sink_, {sinnen}, _to reflect_,  {spinnen}, _to spin_, {swimmen}, _to swim_, {trinken}, _to drink_,  {vinden} (p.p. {vunden}), _to find_, {winden}, _to wind_. {beginnen},  _to begin_, pret. sing. {began} beside {begunde}, {begonde}, pl.  {begunden}, p.p. {begunnen}.      b[e:]rgen, _to hide_    birge    bare    burgen    geborgen    h[e:]lfen, _to help_    hilfe    half    hulfen    geholfen    st[e:]rben, _to die_    stirbe   starp   sturben   gestorben    And similarly {bev[e:]lhen}, _to order_, {emph[e:]lhen}, {enph[e:]lhen},  _to recommend_, {g[e:]lten}, _to pay_, {m[e:]lken}, _to milk_, {sch[e:]lten},  _to revile_, {sw[e:]llen}, _to swell_, {verd[e:]rben}, _to destroy_,  {w[e:]rfen}, _to throw_, {w[e:]rren}, _to confuse_, {w[e:]rden}, _to  become_, pret. pl. {wurten}, {wurden}, p.p. {worten}, {(ge)worden}, see  Sec. 30.      CLASS IV.    Sec. 82.    The verbs of this class belong to the fourth ablaut-series (Sec. 12). They  include those strong verbs which have a liquid or a nasal before or  after the stem-vowel, and a few others, thus:--        [e:]                   i             a       [a]         o    n[e:]men, _to take_     nime          nam     n[a]men     genomen    b[e:]rn, _to bear_      bir (Sec. 9, 1)   bar     b[a]ren     geborn    st[e:]ln, _to steal_    stil (Sec. 9, 1)  stal    st[a]len    gestoln    br[e:]chen, _to break_  briche        brach   br[a]chen   gebrochen    v[e:]hten, _to fight_   vihte         vaht    v[a]hten    gevohten    And similarly {sch[e:]rn}, _to shear_, {schr[e:]cken}, _to frighten_,  {spr[e:]chen}, _to speak_, {vl[e:]hten}, _to plait_, {z[e:]men} (p.p. also  {gez[e:]men}), _to be befitting_, {st[e:]chen}, _to prick_, {tr[e:]ffen} (p.p.  {troffen}), _to hit_; {dreschen}, _to thrash_, {leschen}, _to be  extinguished_, see Sec. 11, 1. {komen} (OHG. {qu[e:]man}), _to come_, {kume},  {quam}, {qu[a]men}, {komen}; on other forms of this verb, see Sec. 36.      CLASS V.    Sec. 83.    The verbs of this class belong to the fifth ablaut-series (Sec. 12). They  include the strong verbs containing a medial consonant other than a  nasal or liquid, thus:--        {[e:]}              {i}         {a}    {[a]}     {[e:]}    g[e:]ben, _to give_   gibe        gap    g[a]ben   geg[e:]ben    j[e:]hen, _to say_    gihe (Sec. 35)  jach   j[a]hen   gej[e:]hen    s[e:]hen, _to see_    sihe        sach   s[a]hen   ges[e:]hen    w[e:]gen, _to move_   wige        wac    w[a]gen   gew[e:]gen    And similarly {gesch[e:]hen}, _to happen_, {kn[e:]ten}, _to knead_,  {m[e:][zz]en}, _to measure_, {pfl[e:]gen}, _to be accustomed_, {tr[e:]ten},  _to tread_, {verg[e:][zz]en}, _to forget_, {w[e:]ben}, _to weave_.      w[e:]sen, _to be_   wise   was   w[a]ren   gew[e:]sen    And similarly {gen[e:]sen} (pret. pl. also {gen[a]sen}), _to recover_,  {j[e:]sen}, _to ferment_, {l[e:]sen} (pret. pl. also {l[a]sen}), _to gather,  read_. See Sec. 30.      [e:][zz]en, _to eat_       i[zz]e    [a][z](a[z])   [a][z]en     g[e:][zz]en       (Sec. 9,7)    vr[e:][zz]en, _to devour_  vri[zz]e  vr[a][z]     vr[a][z]en   vr[e:][zz]en    These verbs had a long vowel in the pret. singular in the oldest period  of all the Germanic languages, cp. also Lat. {[e]d[i]}.      Sec. 84.    To this class also belong the three verbs:--      bit(t)en, _to beg_     bite    bat   b[a]ten   geb[e:]ten    ligen, _to lie down_   lige    lac   l[a]gen   gel[e:]gen    sitzen, _to sit_       sitze   sa[z]   s[a][z]en   ges[e:][zz]en    {bit(t)en}, OHG. {bitten} from {*bidjan}; {ligen}, OHG. {liggen} from  {*ligjan}; {sitzen}, OHG. {sitzen} from {*sitjan}, see Secs. 14, 31,3. The  inf. {ligen} is sometimes contracted to {l[i]n}, see Sec. 37.      CLASS VI.    Sec. 85.    The verbs of this class belong to the sixth ablaut-series (Sec. 12), and  accordingly have {a} in the present; {uo} in the pret. singular and  plural; and {a} in the past participle. They have umlaut in the second  and third pers. singular, as {grebes(t)}, {grebet}; {verst}, {vert}. See  Sec. 10.      graben, _to dig_     gruop   gruoben   gegraben    tragen, _to carry_   truoc   truogen   getragen    maln, _to grind_     muol    muolen    gemaln    varn, _to go_        vuor    vuoren    gevarn    And similarly {laden}, _to load_, {nagen}, _to gnaw_, {schaffen}, _to  create_, {spanen}, _to entice_, {waschen}, _to wash_, {wahsen}, _to  grow_, {waten}, _to wade_.      slahen, _to strike_   sluoc   sluogen   geslagen    twahen, _to wash_     twuoc   twuogen   getwagen    See Sec. 30. The pret. sing. {sluoc}, {twuoc} for {*sluoch}, {*twuoch} were  formed after the analogy of the pret. plural.      Sec. 86.    To this class also belong:--      st[a]n, st[e]n (Sec. 96),      _to stand_                stuont    stuonden    gestanden    entseben (older entseven),      _to perceive_             entsuop   entsuoben   entsaben    gew[a:]henen,      _to mention_              gewuoc    gewuogen    gewagen    heben (older heven),      _to raise_                huop      huoben      gehaben    swern (see Sec. 35),      _to swear_                swuor     swuoren     geswarn}                                                      gesworn}    The pret. singular {stuont}, {entsuop}, {gewuoc}, {huop} for {*stuot}  (cp. Engl. {stood}), {*entsuof}, {*gewuoch}, {*huof} were formed after  the analogy of the pret. plural. On the {b, g} in the pret. plural, see  Sec. 30. The last four verbs in the list originally had a {j} in the  present, which accounts for the umlaut, cp. OHG. {heffen}, Goth.  {hafjan}, _to raise_. {heben} had its {b} from forms where it was  regular.      CLASS VII.    Sec. 87.

The truth was that the Clan Mac-Ivor had taken it into their  heads that Edward had somehow slighted their Lady Flora. They saw that  the Chief's brow was dark against Edward, and therefore he became all at  once fair game for a bullet or a stab in the dark.    And the first of these was not long in arriving.           *       *       *       *       *        And here (I concluded) is the end of the fifth      tale.        \"Go on--oh--go on!\" shouted all the four listeners      in chorus; \"we don't want to play or to talk, just      now. We want to know what happened.\"        \"Very well, then,\" said I, \"then the next story      shall be called 'Black Looks and Bright Swords.'\"        Carrying out which resolve we proceeded at once to      the telling of          THE SIXTH TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"      BLACK LOOKS AND BRIGHT SWORDS    IT was in the dusk of an avenue that Evan Dhu had warned Waverley to  beware, and ere he had reached the end of the long double line of trees,  a pistol cracked in the covert, and a bullet whistled close past his  ear.    \"There he is,\" cried Edward's attendant, a stout Merseman of the  Baron's troop; \"it's that devil's brat, Callum Beg.\"    And Edward, looking through the trees, could make out a figure running  hastily in the direction of the camp of the Mac-Ivors.    Instantly Waverley turned his horse, and rode straight up to Fergus.    \"Colonel Mac-Ivor,\" he said, without any attempt at salutation, \"I have  to inform you that one of your followers has just attempted to murder me  by firing upon me from a lurking-place.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the Chief, haughtily; \"well, as that, save in the matter  of the lurking-place, is a pleasure I presently propose for myself, I  should be glad to know which of my clansmen has dared to anticipate me.\"    \"I am at your service when you will, sir,\" said Edward, with equal  pride, \"but in the meantime the culprit was your page, Callum Beg.\"    \"Stand forth, Callum Beg,\" cried Vich Ian Vohr; \"did you fire at Mr.  Waverley?\"    \"No,\" said the unblushing Callum.    \"You did,\" broke in Edward's attendant, \"I saw you as plain as ever I  saw Coudingham kirk!\"    \"You lie!\" returned Callum, not at all put out by the accusation. But  his Chief demanded Callum's pistol. The hammer was down. The pan and  muzzle were black with smoke, the barrel yet warm. It had that moment  been fired.    \"Take that!\" cried the Chief, striking the boy full on the head with the  metal butt; \"take that, for daring to act without orders and then lying  to disguise it.\"    Callum made not the slightest attempt to escape the blow, and fell as if  he had been slain on the spot.    \"And now, Mr. Waverley,\" said the Chief, \"be good enough to turn your  horse twenty yards with me out upon the common. I have a word to say to  you.\"    Edward did so, and as soon as they were alone, Fergus fiercely charged  him with having thrown aside his sister Flora in order to pay his court  to Rose Bradwardine, whom, as he knew, Fergus had chosen for his own  bride.    \"It was the Prince--the Prince himself who told me!\" added Fergus,  noticing the astonishment on Edward's face.    \"Did the Prince tell you that I was engaged to Miss Rose Bradwardine?\"  cried Edward.    \"He did--this very morning,\" shouted Fergus; \"he gave it as a reason for  a second time refusing my request. So draw and defend yourself, or  resign once and forever all claims to the lady.\"    \"In such a matter I will not be dictated to by you or any man living!\"  retorted Waverley, growing angry in his turn.    In a moment swords were out and a fierce combat was beginning, when a  number of Bradwardine's cavalry, who being Lowlanders were always at  feud with the Highlandmen, rode hastily up, calling on their companions  to follow. They had heard that there was a chance of a fight between  their corps and the Highlanders. Nothing would have pleased them  better. The Baron himself threatened that unless the Mac-Ivors returned  to their ranks, he would charge them, while they on their side pointed  their guns at him and his Lowland cavalry.    A cry that the Prince was approaching alone prevented bloodshed. The  Highlanders returned to their places. The cavalry dressed its ranks. It  was indeed the Chevalier who arrived. His first act was to get one of  his French officers, the Count of Beaujeu, to set the regiment of  Mac-Ivors and the Lowland cavalry again upon the road. He knew that the  Count's broken English would put them all in better humour, while he  himself remained to make the peace between Fergus and Waverley.    Outwardly the quarrel was soon made up. Edward explained that he had no  claims whatever to be considered as engaged to Rose Bradwardine or any  one else, while Fergus sulkily agreed that it was possible he had made a  mistake. The Prince made them shake hands, which they did with the air  of two dogs whom only the presence of the master kept from flying at  each other's throats. Then after calming the Clan Mac-Ivor and riding  awhile with the Baron's Lowland cavalry, the Prince returned to the  Count of Beaujeu, saying with a sigh, as he reined his charger beside  him, \"Ah, my friend, believe me this business of prince-errant is no bed  of roses!\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was not long before the poor Prince had a further proof of this fact.    On the 5th of December, after a council at Derby, the Highland chiefs,  disappointed that the country did not rally about them, and that the  government forces were steadily increasing on all sides, compelled the  Prince to fall back toward Scotland. Fergus Mac-Ivor fiercely led the  opposition to any retreat. He would win the throne for his Prince, or if  he could not, then he and every son of Ivor would lay down their lives.  That was his clear and simple plan of campaign. But he was easily  overborne by numbers, and when he found himself defeated in council, he  shed actual tears of grief and mortification. From that moment Vich Ian  Vohr was an altered man.    Since the day of the quarrel Edward had seen nothing of him. It was,  therefore, with great surprise that he saw Fergus one evening enter his  lodgings and invite him to take a walk with him. The Chieftain smiled  sadly as he saw his old friend take down his sword and buckle it on.  There was a great change in the appearance of Vich Ian Vohr. His cheek  was hollow. His eye burned as if with fever.    As soon as the two young men had reached a beautiful and solitary glen,  Fergus began to tell Edward that he had found out how wrongheaded and  rash he had been in the matter of their quarrel. \"Flora writes me,\"  continued Fergus, \"that she never had, and never could have, the least  intention of giving you any encouragement. I acted hastily--like a  madman!\"    Waverley hastily entreated him to let all be forgotten, and the two  comrades-in-arms shook hands, this time heartily and sincerely.    Notwithstanding, the gloom on the Chief's brow was scarcely lightened.  He even besought Waverley to betake himself at once out of the kingdom  by an eastern port, to marry Rose Bradwardine, and to take Flora with  him as a companion to Rose, and also for her own protection.    Edward was astonished at this complete change in Fergus.    \"What!\" he cried, \"abandon the expedition on which we have all  embarked?\"    \"Embarked,\" answered the Chief, bitterly; \"why, man, the expedition is  going to pieces! It is time for all those who can, to get ashore in the  longboat!\"    \"And what,\" said Edward, \"are the other Highland chiefs going to do?\"    \"Oh, the chiefs,\" said Fergus, contemptuously, \"they think that all the  heading and hanging will, as before, fall to the lot of the Lowlands,  and that they will be left alone in their poor and barren Highlands, to  'listen to the wind on the hill till the waters abate.' But they will be  disappointed. The government will make sure work this time, and leave  not a clan in all the Highlands able to do them hurt. As for me, it will  not matter. I shall either be dead or taken by this time to-morrow. I  have seen the _Bodach Glas_--the Grey Spectre.\"    Edward looked the surprise he did not speak.    \"Why!\" continued Fergus, in a low voice, \"were you so long about  Glennaquoich and yet never heard of the Bodach Glas? The story is well  known to every son of Ivor. I will tell it you in a word. My forefather,  Ian nan Chaistel, wasted part of England along with a Lowland chief  named Halbert Hall. After passing the Cheviots on their way back, they  quarrelled about the dividing of the spoil, and from words came speedily  to blows. In the fight, the Lowlanders were cut off to the last man, and  their leader fell to my ancestor's sword. But ever since that day the  dead man's spirit has crossed the Chief of Clan Ivor on the eve of any  great disaster. My father saw him twice, once before he was taken  prisoner at Sheriff-Muir, and once again on the morning of the day on  which he died.\"    Edward cried out against such superstition.    \"How can you,\" he said, \"you who have seen the world, believe such  child's nonsense as that?\"    \"Listen,\" said the Chief, \"here are the facts, and you can judge for  yourself. Last night I could not sleep for thinking on the downfall of  all my hopes for the cause, for the Prince, for the clan--so, after  lying long awake, I stepped out into the frosty air. I had crossed a  small foot-bridge, and was walking backward and forward, when I saw,  clear before me in the moonlight, a tall man wrapped in a grey plaid,  such as the shepherds wear. The figure kept regularly about four yards  from me.\"    \"That is an easy riddle,\" exclaimed Edward; \"why, my dear Fergus, what  you saw was no more than a Cumberland peasant in his ordinary dress!\"    \"So I thought at first,\" answered Fergus, \"and I was astonished at the  man's audacity in daring to dog me. I called to him, but got no answer.  I felt my heart beating quickly, and to find"]]]
