Anthony (#13)"],[1,"her surprise a wealthy Quaker, whom she had met at the Albany  convention, so solicitous of her comfort that he placed heated planks  under her feet, making the long ride much more bearable. He turned up  again, this time with his own sleigh, at the close of one of her  meetings in northern New York, and wrapped in fur robes, she drove  with him behind spirited gray horses to his sisters' home to stay over  Sunday, and then to all her meetings in the neighborhood. It was  pleasant to be looked after and to travel in comfort and she enjoyed  his company, but when he urged her to give up the hard life of a  reformer to become his wife, there was no hesitation on her part. She  had dedicated her life to freeing women and Negroes and there could be  no turning aside. If she ever married, it must be to a man who would  encourage her work for humanity, a great man like Wendell Phillips, or  a reformer like Parker Pillsbury.    Returning home in May 1855, she took stock of her accomplishments. She  had canvassed fifty-four counties and sold 20,000 tracts. Her expenses  had been $2,291 and she had paid her way by selling tracts and by a  small admission charge for her meetings. She even had seventy dollars  over and above all expenses. She promptly repaid the fifty dollars  which Wendell Phillips had advanced, but he returned it for her next  campaign.    However, her heart quailed at the prospect of another such winter, as  she recalled the long, bitter-cold days of travel and the indifference  of the women she was trying to help. Even the unfailing praise of her  family and of Elizabeth Stanton, even the kindness and interest of the  new friends she made paled into insignificance before the thought of  another lone crusade. She was exhausted and suffering with rheumatic  pains, and yet she would not rest, but prepared for an ambitious  convention at Saratoga Springs, then the fashionable summer resort of  the East.    She had braved this center of fashion and frivolity the year before  with her message of woman's rights, and to her great surprise, crowds  seeking entertainment had come to her meetings, their admission fees  and their purchase of tracts making the venture a financial success.  Here was fertile ground. Susan was counting on Lucy Stone and  Antoinette Brown to help her, for Elizabeth Stanton, then expecting  her sixth baby, was out of the picture. Now, to her dismay, Lucy and  Antoinette married the Blackwell brothers, Henry and Samuel.    Fearing that they too like Elizabeth Stanton would be tied down with  babies and household cares, Susan saw a bleak lonely road ahead for  the woman's rights movement. She did so want her best speakers and  most valuable workers to remain single until the spade work for  woman's rights was done. Almost in a panic at the prospect of being  left to carry on the Saratoga convention alone, Susan wrote Lucy  irritable letters instead of praising her for drawing up a marriage  contract and keeping her own name. Later, however, she realized what  it had meant for Lucy to keep her own name, and then she wrote her, \"I  am more and more rejoiced that you have declared by actual doing that  a woman has a name and may retain it all through her life.\"[59]    So persistently did she now pursue Lucy and Antoinette that they both  kept their promise to speak at the Saratoga convention, Lucy traveling  all the way from Cincinnati where she was visiting in the Blackwell  home. Lucy was loudly cheered by a large audience, eager to see this  young woman whose marriage had attracted so much notice in the press.  In fact Lucy Stone, who had kept her own name and who with her husband  had signed a marriage protest against the legal disabilities of a  married woman, was as much of a novelty in this fashionable circle as  one of Barnum's high-priced curiosities.    Pleased at Lucy's reception, Susan surveyed the audience  hopefully--handsome men in nankeen trousers, red waistcoats, white  neckcloths, and gray swallowtail coats, sitting beside beautiful young  women wearing gowns of bombazine and watered silk with wide hoop  skirts and elaborately trimmed bonnets which set off their curls. To  her delight, they also applauded Antoinette Brown Blackwell, the first  woman minister they had ever seen, and Ernestine Rose with her  appealing foreign accent. They clapped loudly when she herself asked  them to buy tracts and contribute to the work.    Complimentary as this was, she did not flatter herself that they had  endorsed woman's rights. That they had come to her meetings in large  numbers while vacationing in Saratoga Springs, this was important. In  some a spark of understanding glowed, and this spark would light  others. They came from the South, from the West, and from the large  cities of the East. There were railroad magnates among them, rich  merchants, manufacturers, and politicians. Charles F. Hovey, the  wealthy Boston dry-goods merchant, listened attentively to every word,  and in the years that followed became a generous contributor to the  cause.           *       *       *       *       *    Realizing how very tired she was and that she must feel more  physically fit before continuing her work, Susan decided to take the  water cure at her cousin Seth Rogers' Hydropathic Institute in  Worcester, Massachusetts. This well-known sanitorium prescribed water  internally and externally as a remedy for all kinds of ailments, and  in an age when meals were overhearty, baths infrequent, and clothing  tight and confining, the drinking of water, tub baths, showers, and  wet packs had enthusiastic advocates. The soothing baths relaxed  Susan and the leisure to read refreshed and strengthened her. She  read, one after another, Carlyle's _Sartor Resartus_, George Sand's  _Consuelo_, Madame de Stael's _Corinne_, then Frances Wright's _A Few  Days in Athens_ and Mrs. Gaskell's _Life of Charlotte Bronte_, making  notes in her diary (1855) of passages she particularly liked. She  discussed current events with her cousin Seth on long drives in the  country, finding him a delightful companion, well-read, understanding,  and interested in people and causes. He took her to her first  political meeting, where she was the only woman present and had a seat  on the platform. It was one of the first rallies of the new Republican  party which had developed among rebellious northern Whigs,  Free-Soilers, and anti-Nebraska Democrats who opposed the extension of  slavery. After listening to the speakers, among them Charles Sumner,  she drew these conclusions: \"Had the accident of birth given me place  among the aristocracy of sex, I doubt not I should be an active,  zealous advocate of Republicanism; unless perchance, I had received  that higher, holier light which would have lifted me to the sublime  height where now stand Garrison, Phillips, and all that small band  whose motto is 'No Union with Slaveholders.'\"[60]    After listening to the satisfying sermons of Thomas Wentworth  Higginson at his Free Church in Worcester, she wrote in her diary, \"It  is plain to me now that it is not sitting under preaching I dislike,  but the fact that most of it is not of a stamp that my soul can  respond to.\"[61]    In September she interrupted \"the cure\" to attend a woman's rights  meeting in Boston, and with Lucy Stone, Antoinette and Ellen Blackwell  visited in the home of the wealthy merchant, Francis Jackson, making  many new friends, among them his daughter, Eliza J. Eddy, whose  unhappy marriage was to prove a blessing to the woman's rights  cause.[62]    At tea at the Garrisons', she met many of the \"distinguished\" men and  women she had \"worshiped\" from afar. She heard Theodore Parker preach  a sermon which filled her soul, and with Mr. Garrison called on him in  his famous library. \"It really seemed audacious in me to be ushered  into such a presence and on such a commonplace errand as to ask him to  come to Rochester to speak in a course of lectures I am planning,\" she  wrote her family, \"but he received me with such kindness and  simplicity that the awe I felt on entering was soon dissipated. I then  called on Wendell Phillips in his sanctum for the same purpose. I have  invited Ralph Waldo Emerson by letter and all three have promised to  come. In the evening with Mr. Jackson's son James, Ellen Blackwell and  I went to see _Hamlet_. In spite of my Quaker training, I find I enjoy  all these worldly amusements intensely.\"[63]           *       *       *       *       *    In January 1856, Susan set out again on a woman's rights tour of New  York State to gather more signatures for her petitions. This time she  persuaded Frances D. Gage of Ohio, a temperance worker and popular  author of children's stories, to join her. An easy extemporaneous  speaker, Mrs. Gage was an attraction to offer audiences, who drove  eight or more miles to hear her; and in the cheerless hotels at night  and on the long cold sleigh rides from town to town, she was a  congenial companion.    The winter was even colder and snowier than that of the year before.  \"No trains running,\" Susan wrote her family, \"and we had a 36-mile  ride in a sleigh.... Just emerged from a long line of snow drifts and  stopped at this little country tavern, supped, and am now roasting  over the hot stove.\"[64]    Confronted almost daily with glaring examples of the injustices women  suffered under the property laws, she was more than ever convinced  that her work was worth-while. \"We stopped at a little tavern where  the landlady was not yet twenty and had a baby, fifteen months old,\"  she reported. \"Her supper dishes were not washed and her baby was  crying.... She rocked the little thing to sleep, washed the dishes and  got our supper; beautiful white bread, butter, cheese, pickles, apple  and mince pie, and excellent peach preserves. She gave us her warm  room to sleep in.... She prepared a six o'clock breakfast for us,  fried pork, mashed potatoes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#13)"],[1," forth. In spite of a certain rough but not unattractive directness of  diction, a prolonged reading of them is very tedious, as will have  been sufficiently seen from the extracts we have given. Their humour  is of a particularly juvenile and obvious character, and consists  almost entirely in the childish device of clothing the personages with  ridiculous but non-essential attributes, or in placing them in  grotesque but pointless situations. Of the more subtle humour, which  consists in the discovery of real but hidden incongruities, and the  perception of what is innately absurd, there is no trace. The obvious  abuses of the time are satirized in this way _ad nauseam_. The  rapacity of the clergy in general, the idleness and lasciviousness of  the monks, the pomp and luxury of the prince-prelates, the  inconsistencies of Church traditions and practices with Scripture,  with which they could now be compared, since it was everywhere  circulated in the vulgar tongue, form their never-ending theme. They  reveal to the reader a state of things that strikes one none the less  in English literature of the period--the intense interest of all  classes in theological matters. It shows us how they looked at all  things through a theological lens. Although we have left this phase of  popular thought so recently behind us, we can even now scarcely  imagine ourselves back into it. The idea of ordinary men, or of the  vast majority, holding their religion as anything else than a very  pious opinion absolutely unconnected with their daily life, public or  private, has already become almost inconceivable to us. In all the  writings of the time, the theological interest is in the forefront.  The economic and social groundwork only casually reveals itself. This  it is that makes the reading of the sixteenth-century polemics so  insufferably jejune and dreary. They bring before us the ghosts of  controversies in which most men have ceased to take any part, albeit  they have not been dead and forgotten long enough to have acquired a  revived antiquarian interest.    The great bombshell which Luther cast forth on June 24, 1520, in his  address to the German nobility,[11] indeed, contains strong appeals to  the economical and political necessities of Germany, and therein we  see the veil torn from the half-unconscious motives that lay behind  the theological mask; but, as already said, in the popular literature,  with a few exceptions, the theological controversy rules undisputed.    The noticeable feature of all this irruption of the _cacoethes  scribendi_ was the direct appeal to the Bible for the settlement not  only of strictly theological controversies but of points of social and  political ethics also. This practice, which even to the modern  Protestant seems insipid and played out after three centuries and a  half of wear, had at that time the to us inconceivable charm of  novelty; and the perusal of the literature and controversies of the  time shows that men used it with all the delight of a child with a new  toy, and seemed never tired of the game of searching out texts to  justify their position. The diffusion of the whole Bible in the  vernacular, itself a consequence of the rebellion against priestly  tradition and the authority of the Fathers, intensified the revolt by  making the pastime possible to all ranks of society.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] See Appendix C.    [10] We use the word \"due\" here for the German word _Guelt_. The  corresponding English of the time does not make any distinction between  _Guelt_ or interest, and _Wucher_ or usury.    [11] _An der Christlichen Adel deutscher Nation._          CHAPTER III    THE FOLKLORE OF REFORMATION GERMANY      Now in the hands of all men, the Bible was not made the basis of  doctrinal opinions alone. It lent its support to many of the popular  superstitions of the time, and in addition it served as the  starting-point for new superstitions and for new developments of the  older ones. The Pan-daemonism of the New Testament, with its  wonder-workings by devilish agencies, its exorcisms of evil spirits  and the like, could not fail to have a deep effect on the popular  mind. The authority that the book believed to be divinely inspired  necessarily lent to such beliefs gave a vividness to the popular  conception of the devil and his angels, which is apparent throughout  the whole movement of the Reformation, and not least in the utterances  of the great Luther himself. Indeed, with the Reformation there comes  a complete change over the popular conception of the devil and  diabolical influences.    It is true that the judicial pursuit of witches and witchcraft, in  the earlier Middle Ages only a sporadic incident, received a great  impulse from the Bull of Pope Innocent VIII (Dec. 5, 1484), entitled  _Summis Desideruntes_, to which has been given the title of _Malleus  Maleficorum_, or _The Hammer of Sorcerers_, directed against the  practice of witchcraft; but it was especially amongst the men of the  New Spirit that the belief in the prevalence of compacts with the  devil, and the necessity for suppressing them, took root, and led to  the horrible persecutions that distinguished the \"Reformed\" Churches  on the whole even more than the Catholic.    Luther himself had a vivid belief, tinging all his views and actions,  in the ubiquity of the devil and his myrmidons. \"The devils,\" says he,  \"are near us, and do cunningly contrive every moment without ceasing  against our life, our salvation, and our blessedness.... In woods,  waters, and wastes, and in damp, marshy places, there are many devils  that seek to harm men. In the black and thick clouds, too, there are  some that make storms, hail, lightning, and thunder, that poison the  air and the pastures. When such things happen, the philosophers and  the physicians ascribe them to the stars, and show I know not what  causes for such misfortunes and plagues.\" Luther relates numerous  instances of personal encounters that he himself had had with the  devil. A nobleman invited him, with other learned men from the  University of Wittenberg, to take part in a hare hunt. A large, fine  hare and a fox crossed the path. The nobleman, mounted on a strong,  healthy steed, dashed after them, when, suddenly, his horse fell dead  beneath him, and the fox and the hare flew up in the air and vanished.  \"For,\" says Luther, \"they were devilish spectres.\"    Again, on another occasion, he was at Eisleben on the occasion of  another hare-hunt, when the nobleman succeeded in killing eight hares,  which were, on their return home, duly hung up for the next day's  meal. On the following morning, horses' heads were found in their  place. \"In mines,\" says Luther, \"the devil oftentimes deceives men  with a false appearance of gold.\" All disease and all misfortune were  the direct work of the devil; God, who was all good, could not produce  either. Luther gives a long history of how he was called to a parish  priest, who complained of the devil's having created a disturbance in  his house by throwing the pots and pans about, and so forth, and of  how he advised the priest to exorcise the fiend by invoking his own  authority as a pastor of the Church.    At the Wartburg, Luther complained of having been very much troubled  by the Satanic arts. When he was at work upon his translation of the  Bible, or upon his sermons, or engaged in his devotions, the devil was  always making disturbances on the stairs or in the room. One day,  after a hard spell of study, he lay down to sleep in his bed, when the  devil began pelting him with hazel-nuts, a sack of which had been  brought to him a few hours before by an attendant. He invoked,  however, the name of Christ, and lay down again in bed. There were  other more curious and more doubtful recipes for driving away Satan  and his emissaries. Luther is never tired of urging that contemptuous  treatment and rude chaff are among the most efficacious methods.    There was, he relates, a poor soothsayer, to whom the devil came in  visible form, and offered great wealth provided that he would deny  Christ and never more do penance. The devil provided him with a  crystal, by which he could foretell events, and thus become rich. This  he did; but Nemesis awaited him, for the devil deceived him one day,  and caused him to denounce certain innocent persons as thieves. In  consequence, he was thrown into prison, where he revealed the compact  that he had made, and called for a confessor. The two chief forms in  which the devil appeared were, according to Luther, those of a snake  and a sheep. He further goes into the question of the population of  devils in different countries. On the top of the Pilatus at Luzern, he  says, is a black pond, which is one of the devil's favourite abodes.  In Luther's own country there is also a high mountain, the  Poltersberg, with a similar pond. When a stone is thrown into this  pond, a great tempest arises, which often devastates the whole  neighbourhood. He also alleges Prussia to be full of evil spirits  (!!).    Devilish changelings, Luther said, were often placed by Satan in the  cradles of human children. \"Some maids he often plunges into the  water, and keeps them with him until they have borne a child.\" These  children are placed in the beds of mortals, and the true children are  taken out and hurried away. \"But,\" he adds, \"such changelings are said  not to live more than to the eighteenth or nineteenth year.\" As a  practical application of this, it may be mentioned that Luther advised  the drowning of a certain child of twelve years old, on the ground of  its being a devil's changeling. Somnambulism is, with Luther, the  result of diabolical agency. \"Formerly,\" says he, \"the Papists, being  superstitious people, alleged that persons thus afflicted had not been  properly baptized, or had been baptized by a drunken priest.\" The  irony of the reference to superstition, considering "]]]
