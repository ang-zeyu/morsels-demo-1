[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#13)"],[1,"in  those last months with two or three English scholars one was an  expert in tribal cults, and the other was that pastoral divine.  It was one or other of these Oxford friends of his who sent on  his last letter to the Bishop in December after he had gone away.  Among other messages, the letter brought this one:    'There was something in that Saint Mark's Eve business I suppose.  But I had had my warnings before of an event that is likely  enough to occur this very week. I am glad indeed that I came home  and saw things from other sides before the end. Perhaps those  crowded-out Kaffirs by your leper windows hurried me up with  their intelligence. I am grateful to them for that. Otherwise I  might have delayed, and never started on the home voyage.    'You must make some allowance for my old point of view, as I was  born into it. But now I want to give both Transepts to the Glory  of God on condition that colored folk and natives shall, have  them to themselves undisturbed. Forgive my narrow-mindedness, but  I'd rather have it so than have all races mixed up together, and  perhaps they'd rather have it so themselves! No, I really don't  think I'm dying in the creed of the tribal god Xanthos, but in  the faith of Someone bigger. I can trust you to befriend me at  some altar of His. . . . I wish I could afford the Tower.'    'Alms!' said the Bishop. 'Thank God they'll not be built now by  bazaars or fancy fairs or even by cafes-chantants. Poor base-born  little churches out here, that one so often hears of, aren't they  only too likely to grow up into the temples of the tribal god?'    Thus the Transepts were destined to be of purer lineage than  Chancel or Nave or Lady-chapel. Only the Leper Windows are their  equals in descent as yet among their fellow-buildings. But there  is good hope of an honorable birth for the yet unborn Tower.        THE BURNT OFFERING A SEQUEL TO 'THE LEPER WINDOWS'        ['The Headman made it generally known that he expected all the  men, both Christian and heathen, to subscribe to the funds. One  man refused to give anything, and was taken before the Magistrate  in consequence.' Extract from a South African Church paper,  December 22, 1910.]        The transepts had been built and blessed, the five leper windows  were no longer over-crowded. Xanthos and Melanthos, gods of the  fair and the swart skins, had in a measure met together, and in a  sense kissed each other. Much remained to be achieved in the  matter of mutual good understanding, and much more again in the  supercession of these tribal deities by a Greater.    On the other hand, something had been done to teach the devotees  of Xanthos toleration and a spirit of alms. The Bishop now turned  his attention towards Melanthos more particularly what could he  do to ennoble the aims and methods of his clients? He had made a  journey to England and back not long before the blessing of the  transepts. He regretted leaving his flock at the time. Yet  certain observations he had made just ere he started gave him  much food for thought on the voyage. And when he was home in the  old country he was glad to find time and occasion to observe  afresh, supplementing Africa by Europe, intuitions by research.    The Rev. Charles Topready, a keen missionary, had asked him to  visit him the week before he went homewards. It was the season  when that countryside threshed out its millet-grain in a revel  of rhythmic labor. The Bishop delighted in some of those airs  that the sticks beat time to. He was greedy of fantastic  interpretations as he wrote their voweled refrains down in a  note-book.    'We may have a Harvest Thanksgiving in church, may we not, this  coming Sunday?' he said.    Now Harvest Thanksgivings were as red rags to Topready. 'Why  should we bind upon Africa a burden that irks England?' he  groaned. 'Surely it is a mercy that we can start afresh on the  veld with no tradition of a Feast of Pumpkins.'    The Bishop smiled and smoked and argued by the hour. His point  was that festivals of the soil were serviceable for sons of  the soil. That agricultural festivals were serviceable for  husbandmen, pastoral feasts for shepherds and goat-herds, hunting  commemorations like that of Saint Hubert, for those who hunted.  His knowledge of Greece and Rome, pagan and Christian, of  mediaeval England and modern Brittany helped him with many apt  illustrations. Topready stuck out his chin and kept bravely to  his two points the danger of materialism and the menace to the  spiritual cults and festas of Holy Church as by law established  in the England of to-day.    'All right,' said the Bishop, 'let us have no Harvest  Thanksgiving for the tillage of African earth. That is to say not  this year. But keep an open mind.' Topready promised dubiously.    That struggle and waiving of victory had put the Bishop on his  mettle. He had thought out the subject to some purpose before  they met again.    Here are some pages from his English diary:    Sept. 21. Preached at a Thanksgiving in Essex. 'Happy harvest  fields,' quiet tints in the Vicarage garden. A sun that seemed to  make better use of a short day than an African sun would of a  long one. What a festival Topready might have just about this  time if he only liked. The masasas tinted with copper, crimson;  mauve, and pink, and other leaves showing faery green and gold.    Saint Matthew's Day. The festival of the foolery of riches when  Spring is everywhere and the sun is shining.    Oct. (date illegible). Preached at the blessing of the boats in a  small Sussex harbor the herring season just beginning. What  glorious girls' names some of the boats had that we prayed for  'Diana Elizabeth,' for instance, might have sailed out of the  'Faerie Queene.'    Nov. 1 (All Saints'). Went to church at Saint Paul's in a side  chapel.    Nov. 2 (All Souls'). Went to pray in a cemetery chapel.    Both were misty mornings, but the sun each day came out before we  had done, and broke through the dingy windows in a carnage of  color. How fine a side of death, November, the month of the dead,  presents here. Damp and fog and fall of the leaf doubtless the  sorryness of the bad business of decay and punishment but on the  other hand what bravery of sunlight at times, and what colors for  the sun to shine upon. In Africa it's so different. There the  month is a spring month. The gay side of death as a release from  Africa's plentiful curses and bondages is happily prominent. All  Saints' Day our May Day our Feast of Flora and the Rosa Mystica!  What a day for converts suckled in animism! Let us commemorate  the African Saints with garlands of spring flowers as well as  with palms in their hands. Have written to Topready to suggest a  May-Day Festival with African drums to dance to, if no English  May-pole to plait.    Jan. 21 (St. Agnes' Day). Went to a down church, where they had a  sort of special service. Lambing-time among the South Downs just  coming on. The sacrifice pleaded with one main request in view  the blessing on the flocks. If they had only brought some lambs  in! I hope to live to see some pied African lambs and kids in  church yet.    June 21. Went to Stonehenge on the longest day. Would have camped  out there on the eve if the policeman would have let me. Took  observations as to Flame-Stone. Compared notes with those I took  at Zimbabwe this time last year on my way to Topready's.    June 24 (Saint John). Yes, in African Mission Stations we should  have St. John's Fires or fires corresponding to them about  Christmas time.    Then in Mashonaland, summer is at height. Yes, the other Saint  John's Day, or its Eve, would do. Let us give thanks for the  Light of the World and the Sun of Righteousness symbolized by  things seen and enjoyed. What did Saint Patrick do about the  sacred fire? He kept it going, didn't he? Let us light our  bonfires with a good will this coming Christmastide we who live  by sun-time so often.        Back from England came the Bishop full of the lore of early  missions. He had enriched his zeal for broad-basing the people's  worship on their own everyday earth, and for enlightening things  opaque with effulgences invisible. He saw his way more clearly to  further what he had at heart. Topready had had many letters, and  they had had their effect. But he had not capitulated yet. He  capitulated at a price, as we shall see.    'Church ready by Christmas,' wrote Topready, 'please come and  consecrate.' 'Expect me the day after,' telegraphed the Bishop.  He thought about a bonfire as he rode along on that Saint  Stephen's Day. 'The kopje above the Mission!' he reflected. 'A  magnificent place for a beacon-fire.'    To his delight the new church crowned the very kopje he had been  thinking of. There it stood on the sky-line, its gold of fresh  thatch crowned a huge pole building, and was itself crowned by a  white cross.    'How fine!' said the Bishop to himself, 'but there's no room up  there for a bonfire as well, alas!'    Topready did not look over-cheerful when his leader greeted him  with congratulations on the building of the church.    'It's all very well, or rather it might have been ever so much  better,' he said, as they went in.    In the evening there was much time to talk. They sat on the stony  rise above the house with a wide valley view. The starlight was  brilliant above them eager, perfervid, passionate. They were on  the rocks smoking, the Bishop between Topready and Manners, who  was not a parson, but a policeman.    'It's like this,' said Topready. 'Holy Innocents' is the first  church that has been built since I came here. It was built on a  system.'    He explained roughly how it worked. The native teacher used his  personal and official majesty for what it was worth. The people  on the Mission ground were asked for poles, grass, work, &c.  'These were given,' said Topready, 'or at least \"given\" is the  word that I understand my predecessor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#13)"],[1,"Heat to make a  Separation of its more Fixt Elements; and therefore the Fire must be  Increas'd which Carries over the Volatile Salt and the Spirit, they  being, though Beleev'd to be Differing Principles, and though Really  of Different Consistency, yet of an almost Equal Volatility. After  them, as less Fugitive, comes over the Oyl, and leaves behinde the  Earth and the _Alcali_, which being of an Equal Fixednesse, the Fire  Severs them not, for all the Definition of the Schools. And if into a  Red-hot Earthen or Iron Retort you cast the Matter to be Distill'd,  You may Observe, as I have often done, that the Predominant Fire will  Carry up all the Volatile Elements Confusedly in one Fume, which will  afterwards take their Places in the Receiver, either according to the  Degree of their Gravity, or according to the Exigency of their  respective Textures; the Salt Adhering, for the most part, to the  Sides and Top, and the Phlegme Fastening it self there too in great  Drops, the Oyle and Spirit placing themselves Under, or Above one  another, according as their Ponderousness makes them Swim or Sink. For  'tis Observable, that though Oyl or Liquid Sulphur be one of the  Elements Separated by this Fiery _Analysis_, yet the Heat which  Accidentally Unites the Particles of the other Volatile Principles,  has not alwayes the same Operation on this, there being divers Bodies  which Yield Two Oyls, whereof the One sinks to the Bottom of that  Spirit on which the other Swims; as I can shew You in some Oyls of the  same Deers Blood, which are yet by Me: Nay I can shew you Two Oyls  carefully made of the same Parcel of Humane Blood, which not only  Differ extreamly in Colour, but Swim upon one another without Mixture,  and if by Agitation Confounded will of themselves Divorce again.    And that the Fire doth oftentimes divide Bodies, upon the account that  some of their Parts are more Fixt, and some more Volatile, how far  soever either of these Two may be from a pure Elementary Nature is  Obvious enough, if Men would but heed it in the Burning of Wood, which  the Fire Dissipates into Smoake and Ashes: For not only the latter of  these is Confessedly made up of two such Differing Bodies as Earth and  Salt; but the Former being condens'd into that Soot which adheres to  our Chimneys, Discovers it self to Contain both Salt and Oyl, and  Spirit and Earth, (and some Portion of Phlegme too) which being, all  almost, Equally Volatile to that Degree of Fire which Forces them up,  (the more Volatile Parts Helping perhaps, as well as the Urgency of  the Fire, to carry up the more Fixt ones, as I have often Try'd in  Dulcify'd _Colcothar_, Sublim'd by _Sal Armoniack_ Blended with it)  are carried Up together, but may afterwards be Separated by other  Degrees of Fire, whose orderly Gradation allowes the Disparity of  their Volatileness to Discover it self. Besides, if Differing Bodies  United into one Mass be both sufficiently Fixt, the Fire finding no  Parts Volatile enough to be Expell'd or carried up, makes no  Separation at all; as may appear by a Mixture of Colliquated Silver  and Gold, whose Component Metals may be easily Sever'd by _Aqua  Fortis_, or _Aqua Regis_ (according to the Predominancy of the Silver  or the Gold) but in the Fire alone, though vehement, the Metals remain  unsever'd, the Fire only dividing the Body into smaller Particles  (whose Littlenesse may be argu'd from their Fluidity) in which either  the little nimble Atoms of Fire, or its brisk and numberless strokes  upon the Vessels, hinder Rest and Continuity, without any  Sequestration of Elementary Principles. Moreover, the Fire sometimes  does not Separate, so much as Unite, Bodies of a differing Nature;  provided they be of an almost resembling Fixedness, and have in the  Figure of their Parts an Aptness to Coalition, as we see in the making  of many Plaisters, Oyntments, &c. And in such Metalline Mixtures as  that made by Melting together two parts of clean Brass with one of  pure Copper, of which some Ingenious Trades-men cast such curious  Patterns (for Gold and Silver Works) as I have sometimes taken great  Pleasure to Look upon. Sometimes the Bodies mingled by the Fire are  Differing enough as to Fixidity and Volatility, and yet are so  combin'd by the first Operation of the Fire, that it self does scarce  afterwards Separate them, but only Pulverize them; whereof an Instance  is afforded us by the Common Preparation of _Mercurius Dulcis_, where  the Saline Particles of the Vitriol, Sea Salt, and sometimes Nitre,  Employ'd to make the Sublimate, do so unite themselves with the  Mercurial Particles made use of, first to Make Sublimate, and then to  Dulcifie it, that the Saline and Metalline Parts arise together in  many successive Sublimations, as if they all made but one Body. And  sometimes too the Fire does not only not Sever the Differing Elements  of a Body, but Combine them so firmly, that Nature her self does very  seldom, if ever, make Unions less Dissoluble. For the Fire meeting  with some Bodies exceedingly and almost equally Fixt, instead of  making a Separation, makes an Union so strict, that it self, alone, is  unable to Dissolve it; As we see, when an Alcalizate Salt and the  Terrestrial Residue of the Ashes are Incorporated with pure Sand, and  by Vitrification made one permanent Body, (I mean the course or  greenish sort of Glass) that mocks the greatest Violence of the Fire,  which though able to Marry the Ingredients of it, yet is not able to  Divorce them. I can shew you some pieces of Glass which I saw flow  down from an Earthen Crucible purposely Expos'd for a good while, with  Silver in it, to a very vehement Fire. And some that deal much in the  Fusion of Metals Informe me, that the melting of a great part of a  Crucible into Glass is no great Wonder in their Furnaces. I remember,  I have Observ'd too in the Melting of great Quantities of Iron out of  the Oar, by the Help of store of Charcoal (for they Affirm that  Sea-Coal will not yield a Flame strong enough) that by the prodigious  Vehemence of the Fire, Excited by vast Bellows (made to play by great  Wheels turn'd about by Water) part of the Materials Expos'd to it was,  instead of being Analyz'd, Colliquated, and turn'd into a Dark, Solid  and very Ponderous Glass, and that in such Quantity, that in some  places I have seen the very High-wayes, neer such Iron-works, mended  with Heaps of such Lumps of Glasse, instead of Stones and Gravel. And  I have also Observ'd, that some kind of Fire-stone it Self, having  been employ'd in Furnaces wherein it was expos'd to very strong and  lasting Fires, has had all its Fixt Parts so Wrought on by the Fire,  as to be Perfectly Vitrifi'd, which I have try'd by Forcing from it  Pretty large Pieces of Perfect and Transparent Glass. And lest You  might think, _Eleutherius_, that the Question'd Definition of Heat may  be Demonstrated, by the Definition which is wont to be given and  Acquiesc'd in, of its contrary Quality, Cold, whose property is taught  to be _tam Homogenea, quam Heterogenea congregare_; Give me leave to  represent to You, that neither is this Definition unquestionable; for  not to Mention the Exceptions, which a _Logician_, as such, may Take  at it, I Consider that the Union of Heterogeneous Bodies which is  Suppos'd to be the Genuine Production of Cold, is not Perform'd by  every Degree of Cold. For we see for Instance that in the Urine of  Healthy Men, when the Liquor has been Suffer'd a while to stand, the  Cold makes a Separation of the Thinner Part from the Grosser, which  Subsides to the Bottom, and Growes Opacous there; whereas if the  Urinal be Warme, these Parts readily Mingle again, and the whole  Liquor becomes Transparent as before. And when, by Glaciation, Wood,  Straw, Dust, Water, &c. are Suppos'd to be United into one Lump of  Ice, the Cold does not Cause any Real Union or Adunation, (if I may so  Speak) of these Bodies, but only Hardening the Aqueous Parts of the  Liquor into Ice, the other Bodies being Accidentally Present in that  Liquor are frozen up in it, but not Really United. And accordingly if  we Expose a Heap of Mony Consisting of Gold, Silver and Copper Coynes,  or any other Bodies of Differing Natures, which are Destitute of  Aqueous Moisture, Capable of Congelation, to never so intense a Cold,  we find not that these Differing Bodies are at all thereby so much as  Compacted, much less United together; and even in Liquors Themselves  we find _Phaenomena_ which Induce us to Question the Definition which  we are examining. If _Paracelsus_ his Authority were to be look't upon  as a Sufficient Proof in matters of this Nature, I might here insist  on that Process of his, whereby he Teaches that the Essence of Wine  may be Sever'd from the Phlegme and Ignoble Part by the Assistance of  Congelation: and because much Weight has been laid upon this Process,  not only by _Paracelsians_, but other Writers, some of whom seem not  to have perus'd it themselves, I shall give You the entire Passage in  the Authors own Words, as I lately found them in the sixth Book of his  _Archidoxis_, an Extract whereof I have yet about me; and it sounds  thus. _De Vino sciendum est, faecem phlegmaque ejus esse Mineram, &  Vini substantiam esse corpus in quo conservatur Essentia, prout auri  in auro latet Essentia.
