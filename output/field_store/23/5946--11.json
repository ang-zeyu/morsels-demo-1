And since when have you seen any paymaster ridin' down the pike with his  bags full of bills, not that you can use that paper stuff for anythin'  like shoppin', anyway!\"    \"Thanks for the tip,\" Drew cut in. \"We take it kindly.\"    Driscoll's ruffled feelings appeared soothed. \"Jus' thought you boys  oughta know. Me, I have in mind gittin' maybe two or three cans of them  peaches like we got from the sutler's wagon. Them were prime eatin'.  General store might jus' have some. Yankee crackers are right good, too.  Say, that theah stud you got, Rennie, how's he workin' out?\"    \"So far no trouble,\" Drew remarked. \"Only I'm lookin' for a trade--maybe  in town.\"    \"Trade? Why ever a trade?\"    \"We got a couple of river crossin's comin' up ahead,\" the scout  explained. \"And one of them is a good big stretch of deep water--you  don't go wadin' across the Tennessee. I don't want to beg for trouble,  headin' a stud into somethin' as dangerous as that.\"    Driscoll seemed struck by the wisdom of that precaution. \"Now I heard  tell,\" he chimed in eagerly, \"as how a mule is a right sure-footed  critter for a river crossin'. An' a good ridin' mule could suit a man  fine----\"    \"A mule!\" Boyd exploded, outraged. But Drew considered the suggestion  calmly.    \"I'll keep a lookout in town. May be swappin' for that mule yet,  Driscoll. You'll have to pick up my share of peaches if that's the way  it's goin' to be.\"    There were more plans laid for the taking of Calhoun as the hours passed  and the harried company plodded or spurred--depending upon the nature of  the countryside, the activity of Union garrisons, and their general  state of energy at the time--southwest across the length of Kentucky.  Days became not collections of hours they could remember one by one  afterward, but a series of incidents embedded in a nightmare of hard  riding, scanty fare, and constant movement. Not only horses were giving  out now; they dropped men along the way. And some--like Cambridge and  Hilders--vanished completely, either cut off when they went to \"trade\"  mounts, or deserting the troop in favor of their own plans for survival.    The remaining men burst into Calhoun as a cloud of locusts descending on  a field of unprotected vegetation. Drew did not know how much Union  sentiment might exist there, but he judged that their actions would not  leave too many friends behind them. Jugs had appeared, to be passed  eagerly from hand to hand, and the contents of store shelves were swept  up and out before the outraged owners could protest.    It had showered that morning, leaving puddles of mud and water in the  unpaved streets. And at one place there was a mud fight in  progress--laughing, staggering men plastering the stuff over the new  clothes they had looted. Drew rode around such a party, the stud's  prancing and snorting getting him wide room, to tie up at the hitching  rail before the largest store.    A man in his shirt sleeves stood a little to one side watching the  excitement in the street. As Drew came up the man glanced at the scout,  surveying his shabbiness, and his mouth took on the harsh line of a  sneer.    \"Want a new suit, soldier?\" he demanded. \"Just help yourself! You're  late in gettin' to it....\"    Drew leaned against the wall of the store front. He was so tired that  the effort of walking on into that madhouse, where men yelled, grabbed,  fought over selections, was too much to face. This was just another part  of the never-ending nightmare which had entrapped them ever since they  had fled from the bank of the Licking at Cynthiana. Listlessly he  watched one trooper snatch a coat from another, drag it on triumphantly  over a shirt which was a fringe of tatters. He plucked at the front of  his own grimy shirt, and then felt around in the pocket he had so  laboriously stitched beneath the belt of his breeches, to bring out one  creased and worn bill. Spreading it out, he offered it to the man beside  him. To loot an army warehouse was fair play as he saw it. Morgan's  command had long depended upon Union commissaries for equipment,  clothing, and food. And a horse trade was something forced upon him by  expediency. But he still shrank from this kind of foraging.    \"A shirt?\" he asked wearily.    The man glanced from that crumpled bill to Drew's tired face and then  back again. The sneer faded. He reached out, closed the scout's fingers  tight over the money.    \"That's just wastepaper here, son. Come on!\" Catching hold of Drew's  sleeve so tightly that the worn calico gave in a rip, he guided the  other into the store, drawing him along behind a counter until he  reached down into the shadows and came up with a pile of shirts, some  flannel, some calico, and one Drew thought was linen.    \"These look about your size. Take 'em! You might as well have them. Some  of these fellows will just tear them up for the fun of it.\"    Drew fumbled with the pile, a flannel, the linen, and two calico. He  could cram that many into his saddlebags. But the store owner thrust the  whole bundle into his arms.    \"Go ahead, take 'em all! They ain't goin' to leave 'em, anyway.\"    \"Thanks!\" Drew clutched the collection to his chest and edged back along  the wall, avoiding a spirited fight now in progress in the center of  the store. Mud-spattered men came bursting back, wanting to change their  now ruined clothing for fresh. Drew stiff-armed one reeling, singing  trooper out of his path and was gone before the drunken man could resent  such handling. With the shirts still balled between forearm and chest,  he led King away from the store.    \"Ovah heah!\"    That hail in a familiar voice brought Drew's head around. Kirby waved to  him vigorously from a doorway, and the scout obediently rehitched King  to another rack, joining the Texan in what proved to be the village  barber-shop.    Kirby was stripped to the waist, using a towel freely sopped in a large  basin to make his toilet. His face was already scraped clean of beard,  and his hair plastered down into better order than Drew had ever seen  it, while violent scents of bay rum and fancy tonics fought it out in  the small room.    \"What you got there?\" Boyd looked up from a second basin, a froth of  soap hiding most of his face.    \"Shirts--\" Drew dropped his bundle on a chair. He was staring, appalled,  into the stretch of mirror confronting him, unable to believe that the  face reflected there was his own. Skinning his hat onto a shelf, he  moved purposefully toward the row of basins, ripping off his old shirt  as he went.    Where the barber had gone they never did know, but a half hour later  they made some sweeping attempts to clean up the mess to which their  efforts at personal cleanliness had reduced the shop, pleased once more  with what they saw now in the mirror. They had divided the shirts, and  while the fit was not perfect, they were satisfied with the windfall.  Before he left the shop Kirby swept a half dozen cakes of soap into his  haversack.    Boyd was already balancing a bigger sack, full to the top.    \"Peaches, molasses, crackers, pickles,\" he enumerated his treasure trove  to Drew. \"We got us some real eats.\"    \"Hey, you--Rennie!\" As they emerged from the barber-shop Driscoll  trotted up. \"The cap'n wants to see you. He's on the other side of  town--at the smithy.\"    Boyd and Kirby trailed along as Drew obeyed that summons. They found  Campbell giving orders to the smith's volunteer aides, some engaged with  the owner of the shop in shoeing the raiders' horses, others making up  bundles of shoes to be slung from the saddles as they rode out.    \"Rennie\"--the captain waved him out of the rush and clamor of the  smithy--\"I want you to listen to this. You--Hart--come here!\" One of the  men bundling horseshoes dropped the set he was tying together and came.    \"Hart, here, comes from Cadiz. Know where that is?\"    Drew closed his eyes for a moment, the better to visualize the map he  tried to carry in his head. But Cadiz--he couldn't place the town. \"No,  suh.\"    \"It's south, close to the Tennessee line and not too far from the big  river. There's just one thing which may be important about it; it has a  bank and Hart thinks that there are Union Army funds there. We still  have a long way to go, and Union currency could help. Only,\" Campbell  spoke with slow emphasis, \"I want this understood. We take army funds  only. This may just be a rumor, but it is necessary to scout in that  direction anyway.\"    \"You want me to find out about the funds and the river crossin' near  there?\"    \"It's up to you, Rennie. Hart's willin' to ride with you.\"    \"I'll go.\" He thought the bank plan was a wild one, but they did have to  have a safe route to the river.    \"You'll move out as soon as possible. We'll be on our way as soon as we  have these horses shod.\"    Drew doubted that. What he had seen in the streets suggested that it was  not going to be easy to pry most of the company out of Calhoun in a  hurry, but that was Campbell's problem. \"I'll need couriers,\" he said  aloud. It was an advance scout's privilege to have riders to send back  with information.    Campbell hesitated as if he would protest and then agreed. \"You have men  picked?\"    \"Kirby and Barrett. Kirby's had scout experience; Barrett knows part of  this country and rides light.\"    \"All right, Kirby and Barrett. You ready to ride, Hart?\"    The other trooper nodded, picked up a set of extra horseshoes, and went  out of the smithy. Campbell had one last word for Drew.    \"We'll angle south from here to hit the Cumberland River some ten miles  north of Cadiz, Hart knows where. This time of year it ought to be easy  crossin'. But the Tennessee--\" he shook his head--\"that is goin'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#13)"],[1,"3.500-3.520  Tourmaline                                 7-1/4               3.024  Zircon                                     7-1/2               4.70-4.88      PINK STONES.                                           _Hardness._      _Specific Gravity._                                    (See Chapter VII.)

VARIOUS PRECIOUS STONES.      _The Diamond._    To recapitulate certain of the facts respecting the diamond.--This  wonderful gem has the distinction amongst precious stones of being  unique; though many are composed of two, three, or but a small number of  elements, the diamond is the only stone known consisting of one element,  and absolutely nothing else--pure crystallised carbon. Its hardness is  proverbial; not only is it untouched by the action of a hard file, but  it occasionally refuses to split when struck with finely tempered steel,  which it often causes to break. Such was the case with the South African  diamond, for when the knife that was to break it was struck smartly with  a steel bar, the first blow broke the blade without affecting the  diamond, yet a piece of bort, or diamond dust, splinters, or defective  diamonds (all these being called bort), may readily be pulverised in a  hard steel mortar with a hard steel pestle.    The diamond is the hardest stone known; it is also the only stone known  which is really combustible. It is of true adamantine lustre, classed by  experts as midway between the truly metallic and the purely resinous. In  refractive power and dispersion of the coloured rays of light, called  its fire, it stands pre-eminent. It possesses a considerable variety of  colour; that regarded as the most perfect and rare is the blue-white  colour. Most commonly, however, the colours are clear, with steely-blue  casts, pale and neutral-colour yellow, whilst amongst the most expensive  and rare are those of green, pale pink, red, and any other variety with  strong and decided colour. Although these stones are sold by the carat,  there can be no hard and fast rule laid down as to the value of a carat,  for this depends on the size, quality, and the purity of the stone. The  larger the stone the greater the value per carat, and prices have been  known to range from 25_l._ per carat for a small stone to 500_l._ per  carat for a large one, whereas the exceptionally large stones possess a  value almost beyond estimation.    It often happens that some stones--particularly those from South Africa  and Brazil--are tinted when uncut, probably by reason of the action upon  them of their matrix, especially if ironstone, or with rolling for ages  amongst ironstone in river-beds, which gives them a slight metallic  appearance; in each case the cause is suggested by the fact that these  tinted stones are usually found in such places, and that the tinting is  very thin and on the surface only, so that the cutting and shaping of  the stone gets below it to the perfectly clear diamond.    From Pliny and other historians we gather that at various periods  considerable superstition has existed with regard to diamonds, such as  that if one is powdered it becomes poisonous to a remarkable degree;  that gifts of diamonds between lovers--married and unmarried--produce  and seal affection; hence the popularity of diamonds in betrothal  rings. Pretty as is this conceit, there is no doubt about the fact that  the gift of diamonds to the object of one's affections does usually  produce a feeling of pleasure to both parties, from which it would  appear that there is some ground for the belief.      _Corundum._    This mineral is a species of crystal, or crystalline alumina--an almost  pure anhydrous alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}--in many varieties, both of shape  and colour. The chief stone is the ruby, considered, when large, to be  of even more importance and value than the diamond. There are many other  red stones in this group; sapphires, also, are a species of corundum,  both the blue and the colourless varieties, as are also the aquamarine,  the emerald, the amethyst, the topaz, and others, all of widely  differing colour, as well as the star-shaped, or \"aster\" ruby, called  the \"ruby\" cat's-eye. All these vary more in colour than in their  chemical properties. Still another variety, greyish-black and generally  associated with haematite iron ore, is called emery, and, when ground in  different degrees of fineness, is so well known by its general use as a  polishing medium as to need no description. It should, however, be  mentioned that amongst the more coarsely ground emery it is no uncommon  thing to find minute sapphires, taking sapphires in their broad,  commercial meaning, as signifying any variety of corundum, except the  red and the emery. The surfaces of crystals of corundum are often  clouded or dull, whilst its classification of lustre is vitreous. It is  double refracting and has no cleavage. It is found in China, India,  Burma, Ceylon, South Africa, America, and in many other places, having a  wide distribution.      _The Ruby._    In the dichroscope the ruby shows two images, one square of a violet  red, the second square being a truer and a paler red. It may be  subjected to strong heat, when it changes its colour to a sooty or dirty  slate, this varying with the locality in which the stone is found, and  the manner in which the heat is applied. But as it cools it becomes  paler and greener, till it slowly enrichens; the green first becomes  broken, then warmer, redder, and finally assumes its original beautiful  blood red. This method of heating is sometimes used as a test, but it is  a test"]]]
