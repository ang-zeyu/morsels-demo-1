He took them and left them on a rock in  the sea, a rock that the tide would cover.    The Giant stood up in the water taller than the rock, and the tide as it  came in did not rise above his knees. He stood there watching the Dwarfs  as the water rose up round them and they became more and more terrified.    \"Oh, take us off the rock, good Suttung,\" they cried out to him. \"Take  us off the rock and we will give you gold and jewels. Take us off the  rock and we will give you a necklace as beautiful as Brisingamen.\" So  they cried out to him, but the Giant Suttung only laughed at them. He  had no need of gold or jewels.    Then Fialar and Galar cried out: \"Take us off the rock and we will give  you the jars of the Magic Mead we have brewed.\"    \"The Magic Mead,\" said Suttung. \"This is something that no one else has.  It would be well to get it, for it might help us in the battle against  the Gods. Yes, I will get the Magic Mead from them.\"    He took the band of Dwarfs off the rock, but he held Galar and Fialar,  their chiefs, while the others went into their caverns and brought up  the jars of the Magic Mead. Suttung took the Mead and brought it to a  cavern in a mountain near his dwelling. And thus it happened that the  Magic Mead, brewed by the Dwarfs through cruelty and villainy, came into  the hands of the Giants. And the story now tells how Odin, the Eldest of  the Gods, at that time in the world as Vegtam the Wanderer, took the  Magic Mead out of Suttung's possession and brought it into the world of  men.    Now, Suttung had a daughter named Gunnloed, and she by her goodness and  her beauty was like Gerda and Skadi, the Giant maids whom the Dwellers  in Asgard favored. Suttung, that he might have a guardian for the Magic  Mead, enchanted Gunnloed, turning her from a beautiful Giant maiden into  a witch with long teeth and sharp nails. He shut her into the cavern  where the jars of the Magic Mead were hidden.    Odin heard of the death of Kvasir whom he honored above all men. The  Dwarfs who slew him he had closed up in their caverns so that they were  never again able to come out into the World of Men. And then he set out  to get the Magic Mead that he might give it to men, so that, tasting it,  they would have wisdom, and words would be at their command that would  make wisdom loved and remembered.    How Odin won the Magic Mead out of the rock-covered cavern where Suttung  had hidden it, and how he broke the enchantment that lay upon Gunnloed,  Suttung's daughter, is a story often told around the hearths of men.    Nine strong thralls were mowing in a field as a Wanderer went by clad in  a dark blue cloak and carrying a wanderer's staff in his hand. One of  the thralls spoke to the Wanderer: \"Tell them in the house of Baugi up  yonder that I can mow no more until a whetstone to sharpen my scythe is  sent to me.\" \"Here is a whetstone,\" said the Wanderer, and he took one  from his belt. The thrall who had spoken whetted his scythe with it and  began to mow. The grass went down before his scythe as if the wind had  cut it. \"Give us the whetstone, give us the whetstone,\" cried the other  thralls. The Wanderer threw the whetstone amongst them, leaving them  quarreling over it, and went on his way.    The Wanderer came to the house of Baugi, the brother of Suttung. He  rested in Baugi's house, and at supper time he was given food at the  great table. And while he was eating with the Giant a Messenger from the  field came in.    \"Baugi,\" said the Messenger, \"your nine thralls are all dead. They  killed each other with their scythes, fighting in the field about a  whetstone. There are no thralls now to do your work.\"    \"What shall I do, what shall I do?\" said Baugi the Giant. \"My fields  will not be mown now, and I shall have no hay to feed my cattle and my  horses in the winter.\"    \"I might work for you,\" said the Wanderer.    \"One man's work is no use to me,\" said the Giant, \"I must have the work  of nine men.\"    \"I shall do the work of nine men,\" said the Wanderer, \"give me a trial,  and see.\"    The next day Vegtam the Wanderer went into Baugi's field. He did as much  work as the nine thralls had done in a day.    \"Stay with me for the season,\" said Baugi, \"and I shall give you a full  reward.\"    So Vegtam stayed at the Giant's house and worked in the Giant's fields,  and when all the work of the season was done Baugi said to him:    \"Speak now and tell me what reward I am to give you.\"    \"The only reward I shall ask of you,\" said Vegtam, \"is a draught of the  Magic Mead.\"    \"The Magic Mead?\" said Baugi. \"I do not know where it is nor how to get  it.\"    \"Your brother Suttung has it. Go to him and claim a draught of the Magic  Mead for me.\"    Baugi went to Suttung. But when he heard what he had come for, the Giant  Suttung turned on his brother in a rage.    \"A draught of the Magic Mead?\" he said. \"To no one will I give a draught  of the Magic Mead. Have I not enchanted my daughter Gunnloed, so that she  may watch over it? And you tell me that a Wanderer who has done the work  of nine men for you asks a draught of the Magic Mead for his fee! O  Giant as foolish as Gilling! O oaf of a Giant! Who could have done such  work for you, and who would demand such a fee from you, but one of our  enemies, the AEsir? Go from me now and never come to me again with talk  of the Magic Mead.\"    Baugi went back to his house and told the Wanderer that Suttung would  yield none of the Magic Mead. \"I hold you to your bargain,\" said Vegtam  the Wanderer, \"and you will have to get me the fee I asked. Come with me  now and help me to get it.\"    He made Baugi bring him to the place where the Magic Mead was hidden.  The place was a cavern in the mountain. In front of that cavern was a  great mass of stone.    \"We cannot move that stone nor get through it,\" said Baugi. \"I cannot  help you to your fee.\"    The Wanderer drew an auger from his belt. \"This will bore through the  rock if there is strength behind it. You have the strength, Giant. Begin  now and bore.\"    Baugi took the auger in his hands and bored with all his strength, and  the Wanderer stood by leaning on his staff, calm and majestic in his  cloak of blue.    \"I have made a deep, deep hole. It goes through the rock,\" Baugi said,  at last.    The Wanderer went to the hole and blew into it. The dust of the rock  flew back into their faces.    \"So that is your boasted strength, Giant,\" he said. \"You have not bored  half-way through the rock. Work again.\"    Then Baugi took the auger again and he bored deeper and deeper into the  rock. And he blew into it, and lo! His breath went through. Then he  looked at the Wanderer to see what he would do; his eyes had become  fierce and he held the auger in his hand as if it were a stabbing  knife.    \"Look up to the head of the rock,\" said the Wanderer. As Baugi looked up  the Wanderer changed himself into a snake and glided into the hole in  the rock. And Baugi struck at him with the auger, hoping to kill him,  but the snake slipped through.    Behind the mighty rock there was a hollow place all lighted up by the  shining crystals in the rock. And within the hollow place there was an  ill-looking witch, with long teeth and sharp nails. But she sat there  rocking herself and letting tears fall from her eyes. \"O youth and  beauty,\" she sang, \"O sight of men and women, sad, sad for me it is that  you are shut away, and that I have only this closed-in cavern and this  horrible form.\"    A snake glided across the floor. \"Oh, that you were deadly and that you  might slay me,\" cried the witch. The snake glided past her. Then she  heard a voice speak softly: \"Gunnloed, Gunnloed!\" She looked round, and  there standing behind her was a majestic man, clad in a cloak of dark  blue, Odin, the Eldest of the Gods.    \"You have come to take the Magic Mead that my father has set me here to  guard,\" she cried. \"You shall not have it. Rather shall I spill it out  on the thirsty earth of the cavern.\"    \"Gunnloed,\" he said, and he came to her. She looked at him and she felt  the red blood of youth come back into her cheeks. She put her hands with  their sharp nails over her breast, and she felt the nails drive into her  flesh. \"Save me from all this ugliness,\" she cried.    \"I will save you,\" Odin said. He went to her. He took her hands and  held them. He kissed her on the mouth. All the marks of ill favor went  from her. She was no longer bent, but tall and shapely. Her eyes became  wide and deep blue. Her mouth became red and her hands soft and  beautiful. She became as fair as Gerda, the Giant maid whom Frey had  wed.    They stayed looking at each other, then they sat down side by side and  talked softly to each other, Odin, the Eldest of the Gods, and Gunnloed,  the beautiful Giant maiden.    She gave him the three jars of the Magic Mead and she told him she would  go out of the cavern with him. Three days passed and still they were  together. Then Odin by his wisdom found hidden paths and passages that  led out of the cavern and he brought Gunnloed out into the light of the  day.    And he brought with him the jars of the Magic Mead, the Mead whose taste  gives wisdom, and wisdom in such beautiful words that all love and  remember it. And Gunnloed, who had tasted a little of the Magic Mead,  wandered through the world singing of the beauty and the might of Odin,  and of her love for him.

Nothing seemed to answer their purpose so admirably as water. Water,  when decomposed, becomes gas. Convert the gas into heat and it becomes  water again. A very great heat produces only a small quantity of water:  hence the extreme utility of water as a heat producing agent.    The heating factories were all detached buildings, and generally, if at  all practicable, situated near a river, or other body of water. Every  precaution against accident was stringently observed.    There were several processes for decomposing the water explained to me,  but the one preferred, and almost universally used by the people of  Mizora, was electricity. The gases formed at the opposite poles of the  electrical current, were received in large glass reservoirs, especially  constructed for them.    In preparing the heat that gave such a delightful temperature to the  dwellings and public buildings of their vast cities, glass was always  the material used in the construction of vessels and pipes. Glass pipes  conveyed the separate gases of hydrogen and oxygen into an apartment  especially prepared for the purpose, and united them upon ignited  carbon. The heat produced was intense beyond description, and in the  hands of less experienced and capable chemists, would have proved  destructful to life and property. The hardest rock would melt in its  embrace; yet, in the hands of these wonderful students of Nature, it was  under perfect control and had been converted into one of the most  healthful and agreeable agents of comfort and usefulness known. It was  regulated with the same ease and convenience with which we increase or  diminish the flames of a gas jet. It was conducted, by means of glass  pipes, to every dwelling in the city. One factory supplied sufficient  heat for over half a million inhabitants.    I thought I was not so far behind Mizora in a knowledge of heating with  hot air; yet, when I saw the practical application of their method, I  could see no resemblance to that in use in my own world. In winter,  every house in Mizora had an atmosphere throughout as balmy as the  breath of the young summer. Country-houses and farm dwellings were all  supplied with the same kind of heat.    In point of economy it could not be surpassed. A city residence,  containing twenty rooms of liberal size and an immense conservatory, was  heated entire, at a cost of four hundred centimes a year. One dollar per  annum for fuel.    There was neither smoke, nor soot, nor dust. Instead of entering a room  through a register, as I had always seen heated air supplied, it came  through numerous small apertures in the walls of a room quite close to  the floor, thus rendering its supply imperceptible, and making a draft  of cold air impossible.    The extreme cheapness of artificial heat made a conservatory a necessary  luxury of every dwelling. The same pipes that supplied the dwelling  rooms with warmth, supplied the hot-house also, but it was conveyed to  the plants by a very different process.    They used electricity in their hot-houses to perfect their fruit, but  in what way I could not comprehend; neither could I understand their  method of supplying plants and fruits with carbonic acid gas. They  manufactured it and turned it into their hot-houses during sleeping  hours. No one was permitted to enter until the carbon had been absorbed.  They had an instrument resembling a thermometer which gave the exact  condition of the atmosphere. They were used in every house, as well as  in the conservatories. The people of Mizora were constantly  experimenting with those two chemical agents, electricity and carbonic  acid gas, in their conservatories. They confidently believed that with  their service, they could yet produce fruit from their hot-houses, that  would equal in all respects the season grown article.    They produced very fine hot-house fruit. It was more luscious than any  artificially ripened fruit that I had ever tasted in my own country, yet  it by no means compared with their season grown fruit. Their preserved  fruit I thought much more natural in flavor than their hot-house fruit.    Many of their private greenhouses were on a grand scale and contained  fruit as well as flowers. A family that could not have a hot-house for  fresh vegetables, with a few fruit trees in it, would be poor indeed.  Where a number of families had united in purchasing extensive grounds,  very fine conservatories were erected, their expense being divided among  the property holders, and their luxuries enjoyed in common.    So methodical were all the business plans of the Mizora people, and so  strictly just were they in the observance of all business and social  duties that no ill-feeling or jealousy could arise from a combination of  capital in private luxuries. Such combinations were formed and carried  out upon strictly business principles.    If the admirable economy with which every species of work was carried on  in Mizora could be thoroughly comprehended, the universality of luxuries  need not be wondered at. They were drilled in economy from a very early  period. It was taught them as a virtue.    Machinery, with them, had become the slave of invention. I lived long  enough in Mizora to comprehend that the absence of pauperism, genteel  and otherwise, was largely due to the ingenious application of machinery  to all kinds of physical labor. When the cost of producing luxuries  decreases, the value of the luxuries produced must decrease with it. The  result is they are within reach of the narrowest incomes. A life  surrounded by refinement must absorb some of it.    I had a conversation with the Preceptress upon this subject, and she  said:    \"Some natures are so undecided in character that they become only what  their surroundings make them. Others only partially absorb tastes and  sentiments that form the influence about them. They maintain a decided  individuality; yet they are most always noticeably marked with the  general character of their surroundings. It is very, very seldom that a  nature is fixed from infancy in one channel.\"    I told her that I knew of a people whose minds from infancy to mature  age, never left the grooves they were born in. They belonged to every  nationality, and had palaces built for them, and attendants with  cultivated intelligences employed to wait upon them.    \"Are their minds of such vast importance to their nation? You have never  before alluded to intellect so elevated as to command such royal  homage.\" My friend spoke with awakened interest.    \"They are of no importance at all,\" I answered, humiliated at having  alluded to them. \"Some of them have not sufficient intelligence to even  feed themselves.\"    \"And what are they?\" she inquired anxiously.    \"They are idiots; human vegetables.\"    \"And you build palaces for them, and hire servants to feed and tend  them, while the bright, ambitious children of the poor among you,  struggle and suffer for mental advancement. How deplorably short-sighted  are the wise ones of your world. Truly it were better in your country to  be born an idiot than a poor genius.\" She sighed and looked grave.    \"What should we do with them?\" I inquired.    \"What do you do with the useless weeds in your garden,\" she asked  significantly. \"Do you carefully tend them, while drouth and frost and  lack of nourishment cause your choice plants to wither and die?\"    \"We are far behind you,\" I answered humbly. \"But barbarous as you think  we are, no epithet could be too scathing, too comprehensive of all that  was vicious and inhuman, to apply to a person who should dare to assail  the expense of those institutions, or suggest that they be converted to  the cultivation of intellect that _could_ be improved.\"    My friend looked thoughtful for a long time, then she resumed her  discourse at the point where I had so unfortunately interrupted it.    \"No people,\" she said, \"can rise to universal culture as long as they  depend upon hand labor to produce any of the necessities of life. The  absence of a demand for hand labor gives rise to an increasing demand  for brain labor, and the natural and inevitable result is an increased  mental activity. The discovery of a fuel that is furnished at so small a  cost and with really no labor but what machinery performs, marks one  grand era in our mental progress.\"    In mentioning the numerous uses made of glass in Mizora, I must not  forget to give some notice to their water supply in large cities. Owing  to their cleanly advantages, the filtering and storing of rain-water in  glass-lined cisterns supplied many family uses. But drinking water was  brought to their large cities in a form that did not greatly differ from  those I was already familiar with, excepting in cleanliness. Their  reservoirs were dug in the ground and lined with glass, and a perfectly  fitting cover placed on the top. They were constructed so that the water  that passed through the glass feed pipes to the city should have a  uniform temperature, that of ordinary spring water. The water in the  covered reservoirs was always filtered and tested before passing into  the distributing pipes.    No citizen of Mizora ever hied to the country for pure water and fresh  air. Science supplied both in a densely populated city.          CHAPTER X.      When a question as to the existence of social distinctions would be  asked the citizens of Mizora, the invariable answer would be--there were  none; yet a long and intimate acquaintance with them assured me that  there were. They had an aristocracy; but of so peculiar and amiable a  kind that it deserves a special mention. It took a long time for me to  comprehend the exact condition of their society in this respect. That  there were really no dividing lines between the person who"]]]
