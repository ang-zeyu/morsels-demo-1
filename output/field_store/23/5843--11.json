You had better  take this golden casket.    [49.7. S    _Sharvilaka._ I wonder if the man has discovered that I have entered,  and is showing off his poverty in order to make fun of me.  Shall I kill him, or is the poor devil talking in his sleep? [_He takes  a look._] But see! This thing wrapped in a ragged bath-clout, now  that I inspect it by the light of my candle, is in truth a jewel-casket  Suppose I take it. But no! It is hardly proper to rob a  man of good birth, who is as poor as I am. I go.    _Maitreya._ My friend, by the wishes of cows and Brahmans[49] I conjure  you to take this golden casket.    _Sharvilaka._ One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow and  the wish of a Brahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the  candle. I keep about me a moth for the express purpose of extinguishing  candles. I will let him enter the flame. This is his place  and hour. May this moth which I here release, depart to flutter  above the flame in varying circles. The breeze from the insect's  wings has translated the flame into accursed darkness. Or shall I  not rather curse the darkness brought by me upon my Brahmanic  family? For my father was a man who knew the four Vedas, who  would not accept a gift; and I, Sharvilaka, his son, and a Brahman,  I am committing a crime for the sake of that courtezan girl  Madanika. Now I will grant the Brahman's wish. [_He reaches out  for the casket._]    _Maitreya._ How cold your fingers are, man!    _Sharvilaka._ What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching  water. Well, I will put my hand in my armpit [_He warms his left hand  and takes the casket._]    _Maitreya._ Have you got it?    _Sharvilaka._ I could not refuse a Brahman's request. I have it.    P. 80.9]    _Maitreya._ Now I shall sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has  sold his wares.    _Sharvilaka._ O great Brahman, sleep a hundred years! Alas that a  Brahman family should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake  of Madanika, a courtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged  in darkness.        A curse on poverty, I say!        'T is stranger to the manly will;      This act that shuns the light of day        I curse indeed, but do it still.                           19    Well then, I must go to Vasantasena's house to buy Madanika's  freedom. [_He walks about and looks around him._] Ah, I think I  hear footsteps. I hope they are not those of policemen. Never mind.  I will pretend to be a pillar, and wait. But after all, do policemen  exist for me, for Sharvilaka? Why, I am        A cat for crawling, and a deer for flight,      A hawk for rending, and a dog for sight      To judge the strength of men that wake or sleep,      A snake, when 't is advisable to creep,      Illusion's self, to seem a saint or rogue,      Goddess of Speech in understanding brogue;      A light in blackest night, in holes a lizard I can be,      A horse on terra firma, and a ship upon the sea.             20    And again:        Quick as a snake, and steady as a hill;      In flight the prince of birds can show no greater skill;      In searching on the ground I am as keen as any hare,      In strength I am a lion, and a wolf to rend and tear.        21    _Radanika._ [_Entering._] Dear me! Vardhamanaka went to sleep  in the outer court, and now he is not there. Well, I will call  Maitreya. [_She walks about._]    [51.1. S.    _Sharvilaka._ [_Prepares to strike down Radanika, but first takes a  look._] What! a woman? Good! I go.                        [_Exit._           *       *       *       *       *    _Radanika._ [_Recoiling in terror._] Oh, oh, a thief has cut a hole in  the wall of our house and is escaping, I must go and wake Maitreya.  [_She approaches Maitreya._] Oh, Maitreya, get up, get up!  A thief has cut a hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.    _Maitreya._ [_Rising._] What do you mean, wench? \"A hole in the  wall has cut a thief and has escaped\"?    _Radanika._ Poor fool! Stop your joking. Don't you see it?    _Maitreya._ What do you mean, wench? \"It looks as if a second  door had been thrown open\"? Get up, friend Charudatta, get up!  A thief has made a hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.    _Charudatta._ Yes, yes! A truce to your jests!    _Maitreya._ But it isn't a jest. Look!    _Charudatta._ Where?    _Maitreya._ Why, here.    _Charudatta._ [_Gazing._] What a very remarkable hole!        The bricks are drawn away below, above;        The top is narrow, but the center wide;        As if the great house-heart had burst with pride,      Fearing lest the unworthy share its love.                    22    To think that science should be expended on a task like this!    _Maitreya._ My friend, this hole must have been made by one of  two men; either by a stranger, or else for practice by a student  of the science of robbery. For what man here in Ujjayini does  not know how much wealth there is in our house?    _Charud._        Stranger he must have been who made the breach,        His customed harvest in my house to reap;      He has not learned that vanished riches teach        A calm, untroubled sleep.        He saw the sometime greatness of my home        And forced an entrance; for his heart did leap      With short-lived hope; now he must elsewhere roam,        And over broken hopes must sorely weep.                    23    Just think of the poor fellow telling his friends: \"I entered the  house of a merchant's son, and found--nothing.\"    P. 92.4]    _Maitreya._ Do you mean to say that you pity the rascally robber? Thinks  he--\"Here's a great house. Here's the place to carry off a jewel-casket  or a gold-casket.\" [_He remembers the casket. Despondently. Aside._]  Where _is_ that golden casket? [_He remembers the events of the night.  Aloud._] Look, man! You are always saying \"Maitreya is a fool, Maitreya  is no scholar.\" But I certainly acted wisely in handing over that golden  casket to you. If I hadn't, the son of a slave would have carried it  off.    _Charudatta._ A truce to your jests!    _Maitreya._ Just because I'm a fool, do you suppose I don't even  know the place and time for a jest?    _Charudatta._ But when did this happen?    _Maitreya._ Why, when I told you that your fingers were cold.    _Charudatta._ It might have been. [_He searches about. Joyfully._]  My friend, I have something pleasant to tell you.    _Maitreya._ What? Wasn't it stolen?    _Charudatta._ Yes.    _Maitreya._ What is the pleasant news, then?    _Charudatta._ The fact that he did not go away disappointed.    _Maitreya._ But it was only entrusted to our care.    _Charudatta._ What! entrusted to our care? [_He swoons._]    _Maitreya._ Come to yourself, man. Is the fact that a thief stole what  was entrusted to you, any reason why you should swoon?    53.5. S.]    _Charudatta._ [_Coming to himself._] Ah, my friend,        Who will believe the truth?        Suspicion now is sure.      This world will show no ruth        To the inglorious poor.                                    24    Alas!   If envious fate before          Has wooed my wealth alone.        Why should she seek my store          Of virtue as her own?                                    25    _Maitreya._ I intend to deny the whole thing. Who gave anybody  anything? who received anything from anybody? who was a witness?    _Charudatta._ And shall I tell a falsehood now?        No! I will beg until I earn        The wherewithal my debt to pay.      Ignoble falsehood I will spurn.        That steals the character away.                            26    _Radanika._ I will go and tell his good wife. [_She goes out, returning  with Charudatta's wife._]    _Wife._ [_Anxiously._] Oh! Is it true that my lord is uninjured, and  Maitreya too?    _Radanika._ It is true, mistress. But the gems which belong to the  courtezan have been stolen. [_Charudatta's wife swoons._] O my good  mistress! Come to yourself!    _Wife._ [_Recovering._] Girl, how can you say that my lord is uninjured?  Better that he were injured in body than in character. For  now the people of Ujjayini will say that my lord committed this  crime because of his poverty. [_She looks up and sighs._] Ah, mighty  Fate! The destinies of the poor, uncertain as the water-drops which  fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to thee but playthings. There remains  to me this one necklace, which I brought with me from my mother's  house. But my lord would be too proud to accept it. Girl,  call Maitreya hither.    P. 95.7]    _Radanika._ Yes, mistress. [_She approaches Maitreya._] Maitreya,  my lady summons you.    _Maitreya._ Where is she?    _Radanika._ Here. Come!    _Maitreya._ [_Approaching._] Heaven bless you!    _Wife._ I salute you, sir. Sir, will you look straight in front of you?    _Maitreya._ Madam, here stands a man who looks straight in front  of him.    _Wife._ Sir, you must accept this.    _Maitreya._ Why?    _Wife._ I have observed the Ceremony of the Gems. And on this  occasion one must make as great a present as one may to a Brahman.  This I have not done, therefore pray accept this necklace.    _Maitreya._ [_Receiving the necklace._] Heaven bless you! I will go  and tell my friend.    _Wife._ You must not do it in such a way as to make me blush,  Maitreya.                                              [_Exit._    _Maitreya._ [_In astonishment._] What generosity!           *       *       *       *       *    _Charudatta._ How Maitreya lingers! I trust his grief is not leading  him to do what he ought not. Maitreya, Maitreya!    _Maitreya._ [_Approaching._] Here I am. Take that. [_He displays the  necklace._]    _Charudatta._ What is this?    _Maitreya._ Why, that is the reward you get for marrying such a  wife.    _Charudatta._ What! my wife takes pity on me? Alas, now am I  poor indeed!        When fate so robs him of his all,      That on her pity he must call,      The man to woman's state doth fall,   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],[0,"The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#13)"],[1,"the man all the little stock of  money he possessed.    But he was not yet to escape.  From under his jacket the greedy eye of  the thief had caught a glimpse of a chain.  With a rough hand he tore  open the coat.  \"What, a ticker?  Here's luck; out with it, come.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Charlie, \"take anything but that!  Take my chain and my  knife, but not my watch?\"    Hardly and brutally laughed the man as he snatched me out of the poor  boy's hand, and administering a parting cuff on the head of his victim,  turned to walk off with me in the recesses of one of his filthy pockets.    Scarcely, however, had he turned, when three men appeared in front of  him, coming in the direction of Charlie.  The boy saw them, and imagine  his joy when in one of the party he recognised his old acquaintance, the  cabman Jim!  With a sudden bound and cry of delight he rushed towards  him, shouting and pointing to the robber.  \"Oh, Jim, he's taken my  watch; get my watch back, Jim.\"    Jim took in the state of affairs in an instant, and calling on his two  companions to follow him, rushed upon and secured the thief before the  latter was even aware of their intention.  It was vain for one man to  resist three.  He was forced to disgorge first me, then the knife, and  then the money.  Charlie indeed pleaded that they should leave him the  money, or some of it, but this proposal Jim scouted, and in his zeal  relieved the robber of a good deal more than he had stolen from Charlie.  Then with kicks and blows they drove the wretch away as fast as his  legs could carry him.    This done, Jim the cabman had an opportunity of renewing his  acquaintance with my master.    \"Well,\" said he, \"who'd have thought of seeing _you_ here?  And what a  nice mess you're in.  You look as if--\"    \"Oh, don't,\" cried Charlie, holding him by the arm; \"it's bad enough as  it is, without you thinking ill of me.\"    And then he told him as well as he could how he had been decoyed to  these vile races; how he had been kept there by main force; how he had  been made senseless by their rough treatment, and how, but for Jim's  timely help, he would now have been robbed and helpless.    Jim listened in astonishment, not unmingled with many an ejaculation of  indignation at the poor boy's persecutors.    \"And where are they now?\" he asked, when Charlie had done.    \"I don't know.  We were all thrown out, you know, among the crowd.  I  only hope they've not been killed.\"    \"Well, if I was you,\" said the downright cabman, \"I wouldn't break my  heart over them.  I know _I'd_ like to have a chance of a quiet talk  with the young swells; _I'd_ give them something to take home with them,  I would.\"    Charlie said nothing, but gratefully put himself under the protection of  his deliverer, who, making a considerable round to avoid the crush, led  him safely to Gurley.    \"There's no trap to be got for love or money, so you'll just have to  walk if you want to get back to Randlebury to-night.\"    Anything to get away from that odious crowd.  If the distance had been  twice as far, Charlie would have undertaken it.    It was long enough, however, before they got away from the crowd.  The  road from Gurley to Sharle Bridge was alive for a mile and more with  vehicles, drunken men and women, beggars and pickpockets.  On either  side of the road were jugglers, and thimble-riggers, and card-sharpers,  who each attracted their crowd of simpletons.  Many were the fights and  riots that attended these eager assemblages.  As they passed one booth,  the headquarters of a blustering card-sharper, a sudden disturbance  arose which threatened to block the entire road.  The man had offered a  sovereign to any one of his audience who could tell which of three cards  he held uppermost in his hand.  One voice called out a number.  The man  shuffled his cards, and by some slip on his part the guess of the  speculator turned out correct.  Instantly that youth demanded his  sovereign, which the man refused, vowing and calling others to witness  that another number had been guessed.    \"I'll bring the police,\" cried the voice, and instantly there was a  movement in the group as of some one endeavouring to force his way out.    \"Knock him over!\" some one cried; \"he's only one of them donkey  schoolboys.  What business have they here at all?\"  And at the signal  two or three of the juggler's accomplices made a dash at the retreating  youth and seized him.    \"Souse him in the river!\" cried somebody else.    \"Sit on him!\" shouted a third.    In the midst of these contradictory advices the roughs lifted their  struggling victim from his feet, and proceeded to carry him in the  direction of the bridge.    In the momentary glimpse which Charlie got of the wretched object of  this persecution, he recognised, to his horror and astonishment, Tom  Drift, livid with terror, frantic with rage, and yelling with pain.    \"Jim,\" cried Charlie, \"that's Tom Drift!  Oh! can't we help him?  Will  you try, Jim!  Poor Tom!\"    \"Is he one of them four as brought you here?\" asked Jim, not offering to  move.    \"Yes; but never mind that; they will drown him; see how furious they  are!  Will you help him, Jim?\"    \"Not a bit of me,\" replied the stubborn Jim, who was well content to see  the tables turned on one who had so brutally ill-treated his young  companion.    \"Then I must try myself;\" and so saying, the boy of thirteen rushed in  among the crowd, and wildly tried to make his way to where his  schoolfellow was being dragged by his persecutors.    Of course Jim had nothing for it but to back him up, and in a moment he  was beside my young master.    \"Let the boy be!\" he shouted to those who carried Drift, in a voice so  loud that for a moment the rabble stood quiet to hear.    In the midst of this silence Charlie shouted,--    \"Hold on, Tom Drift, we'll help you if we can.\"    Instantly the crowd took up the name.    \"Tom Drift!  Yah!  Souse Tom Drift!  Roll Tom Drift in the mud!  Yah!  Tom Drift!\"    And sure enough Tom Drift would have suffered the penalty prepared for  him, despite Charlie's attempt at rescue, had not help come at that  moment from a most unexpected quarter.    It will be remembered that Joe Halliday and his friend Walcot had  planned a long walk on this holiday to Whitstone Woods, some ten miles  beyond Gurley.    This plan they had duly carried out, and were now making the best of  their way back to Randlebury along the crowded highway, when the sudden  cry of a schoolfellow's name startled them.    \"Tom Drift!  Yah!  Beggarly schoolboy!\"    \"I say, Joe, that's one of our fellows!  What's happening?\"    Joe accosted a passer-by.    \"What's going on?\" he inquired.    \"They're only going to souse a young chap in the river.\"    \"What for?\"    \"I don't know; 'cause he don't think the same as old Shuffle, the three-  card chap.\"    \"We must do something, Joe,\" said Walcot.    \"I wish it were any other chap; but come on, we're in for it now,\" said  Joe.    And with that these two broad-shouldered, tall fellows dashed into the  thick of the fray.    Tom's bearers were now at the bridge, which was a low one, and were  turning down towards the water's edge, when a new cry arrested them.    \"Now, Randlebury!  Put it on, Randlebury!  Who backs up Randlebury?\"    It was the old familiar cry of the football field, and at the sound of  the well-known voices, Charlie's heart leapt for joy.    \"I do!\" he shouted, with all his might.  \"Here you are, Randlebury!\"    And Jim's gruff voice took up the cry too.    A panic set in among the blackguards.  To them it seemed that the school  was come in force to rescue their comrade, for on either side the cry  rose, and fighting towards them they could, see at any rate two stalwart  figures, who, they concluded, were but the leaders of following force.  One of the men was hardy enough to turn at bay at the moment Walcot had  cleared his way at last up to the front.  Big bully though he was, he  was no match for the well-conditioned, active athlete who faced him, and  Walcot punished him in a manner that made him glad enough to take to his  heels as fast as he could.    This exploit turned the day.  Dropping Tom--how and where they did not  stay to consider--they followed their retreating companion with all the  speed they were capable of, and left the enemy without another blow  masters of the situation.    But if, as a victory, this charge of the Randlebury boys had been  successful, as a rescue it had failed; for Tom Drift, being literally  dropped from the shoulders of his executioners, had fallen first on to  the parapet of the bridge, and then with a heavy shock into the stony  stream beneath.  When Walcot, Joe, Charlie, and Jim among them, went to  pull him out, he was senseless.  At first they thought him merely  stunned by the fall (the stream was only a few inches deep), but  presently when they began to lift him, they found that his right arm, on  which he had fallen, was broken.    Bandaging the limb as well as they could, and bathing his forehead with  water, they succeeded in restoring Tom to consciousness, and then,  between them, carried him as gently as possible to the nearest house,  when they managed, with some difficulty, to get a vehicle to convey them  the rest of their journey.  It was a sad, silent journey.  To Tom, the  pain caused by every jolt was excruciating.  They did their best to ease  him, holding him lying across their knees, while Jim drove along the  level footpath; but by the time the school was reached the sufferer was  again insensible, and so he remained till the surgeon had set his arm.    Thus ended the eventful holiday.    Before Charlie went to bed, the doctor sent for him to his study, and  there required to know the true history of that day's doings.  And  Charlie told him all.  I need hardly say that, according to his version,  the case against the four culprits was far lighter than had their  impeachment been"]]]
