[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#13)"],[1," you back  with me to-night.\"    \"If you really think my uncle wishes it, perhaps I had better go,\" said  Kit, in what appeared to be a wavering tone.    Mr. Bickford was quite elated. He feared he should have trouble in  persuading Kit to accompany him. He would not have been surprised if the  boy had disappeared, and given him trouble to find him, and his  unexpected submissiveness was an agreeable surprise.    \"Well, boy, it's time to be goin'. Oakford's six miles off, and we won't  get home before midnight unless we start right off.\"    \"I'll go and get my things, Mr. Bickford. Where is your horse and  wagon?\"    \"Out by the entrance. It's hitched to a tree.\"    \"All right! You go and unhitch the horse, and I'll be right along.\"    \"But suppose you give me the slip? You'd better go along now.\"    \"I'll bring him with me, Mr. Bickford,\" said the giant. \"I'm sorry he  isn't going to stay with us, and I'll see him off.\"    Achilles Henderson spoke in so straightforward a manner that Mr.  Bickford was deceived.    \"Very well,\" he said. \"I'll go along with Mrs. Bickford. Don't keep me  waitin', for it's gettin' late.\"    The blacksmith and his wife took up their march to the place where their  team had been hitched. They found it safe, and untied the horse.    \"We're goin' to have a dark ride home, mother,\" he said.    \"Yes, Aaron, but you've done a good evening's work.\"    \"That's so, Sarah. I expected I'd have more trouble with the boy.\"    \"There's nothing like being firm, Aaron. When he saw you were in  earnest, he gave up.\"    \"I mean to keep a tight rein on him, Sarah. He's a boy that likes to  have his own way, if I ain't greatly mistaken. We must break his will.\"    The horse was unhitched, and still Kit had not arrived. Mr. Bickford  began to fear that he had been tricked after all, when two figures,  contrasting strongly with each other, appeared. One was the giant, in  his ample height, and the other was a boy.    \"There they are, Aaron!\" said Mrs. Bickford, who was the first to descry  the oddly assorted pair.    \"Where is the boy to sit?\" asked Achilles.    \"In the back seat. Mother and I will sit in front.\"    \"All right! There you are!\" said Mr. Henderson, lifting the boy in his  arms, as easily as if he were a kitten, and putting him on the rear  seat.    \"Good-by, Kit!\" he said. \"I'm sorry you're going to leave us. Perhaps  Mr. Bickford will let you off if we show anywhere near here.\"    \"The boy will be at work, and can't be let off,\" said the blacksmith,  stiffly. \"But it is time we were off.\"    \"Good-by, then, Kit!\"    \"Good-by!\" said the supposed Kit, in a low tone, for he feared that the  difference in his voice would be recognized. But Mr. Bickford had no  suspicions. He was anxious to get started, for he and his wife were  always in bed by this time ordinarily.    So the team started, and Achilles Henderson, suppressing a laugh,  strode away to the circus cars, which were already being prepared for a  midnight journey to the next place. It may be explained here that the  circus of to-day generally owns its own cars, which are used for the  conveyance of all connected with it, their luggage, the tents, the  animals, and all the paraphernalia of the show. As soon as the show is  ended, the canvas men set to work to take down and fold up the tents.  All the freight is conveyed to the cars, and the razorbacks, already  referred to, set about loading them. The performers, ticketmen, and  candy butchers seek their berths in the sleeping cars and are often in  the land of dreams before the train starts.    While Mr. Bickford was driving in the darkness to Oakford with the  supposed Kit on the back seat, the real Kit was in his berth in the  circus cars, preparing for a refreshing night's rest.          CHAPTER XVIII.    MR. BICKFORD'S MORTIFYING DISCOVERY.      Mr. Bickford was in excellent spirits. He had enjoyed the evening, and  although he had been compelled to disburse a dollar for two circus  tickets, a sum which to him seemed large, he was disposed to acknowledge  that he had received his money's worth. Besides, and this seemed to him  the greatest triumph of all, he had recovered his runaway apprentice, or  thought he had. He inwardly resolved that Kit should smart for his past  insubordination, though he had not yet decided in what way he would get  even with him. The unexpected submissiveness shown by Kit elated him,  and confirmed him in the idea he had long entertained that he could  manage boys a good deal better than the average of men.    \"Talk about hard cases,\" he said one day to his wife. \"I'd like to see  the boy that can get the start of Aaron Bickford. He'll have to get up  unusually airly in the mornin'.\"    Mr. Bickford felt a little like crowing over his captive, and turned his  head partly round to survey the boy on the back seat. Fortunately for  William the darkness was so great that there was small chance of his  detecting the imposture.    \"I reckon you didn't expect to be ridin' back to Oakford along of me  this evenin',\" he observed.    \"No, sir,\" muttered William in a voice scarcely audible.    \"Ho, ho, you feel kind of grouty, eh?\" said the blacksmith. \"Well, I  ain't much surprised. You thought you could have your own way with Aaron  Bickford, but you're beginnin' to see your mistake, I reckon?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the supposed Kit, in a meek voice.    \"Ho, ho! That's the way boys ginerally come out when they try to buck  agin' their elders. Not but you might have succeeded with some men, but  you didn't know the man you had to deal with this time.\"    There was a sort of gurgle, for William was trying hard not to laugh, as  he was picturing to himself the rage and mortification of Mr. Bickford  when he discovered the deceit that had been practiced upon him. But the  blacksmith misunderstood the sound, and thought Kit was sobbing.    \"You needn't take on!\" he said, magnanimously. \"It ain't so bad as it  might be. You'll be a good deal better off learnin' a good trade than  trampin' round the country with the circus. I hope this'll be a lesson  to you. You'd better not try to run away ag'in, for it won't be no use.  You won't always have that long-legged giant to help you. If I'd done  right, I should have had him took up for 'sault and battery. He needn't  think because he's eight feet high, more or less, that he can defy the  laws of the land. I reckon he got a little skeered of what he done, or  he wouldn't have acted so different this evening.\"    William did not reply to this. He was rather in hopes Mr. Bickford would  stop addressing him, for he did not like to run the risk of answering,  as it might open the eyes of the blacksmith to the fact that he had the  wrong boy in the wagon.    The distance to Oakford steadily diminished, though Mr. Bickford's horse  was a slow one. At length it had dwindled to half a mile.    \"Now I don't care if he does find out who I am,\" thought William. \"It  ain't but a little way home now, and I shouldn't mind walking.\" Still  his own house was rather beyond Mr. Bickford's, and it was just as well  to ride the whole way, if he could escape detection so long.    \"Where did you learn them circus performances, Christopher?\" suddenly  asked the blacksmith, turning once more in his seat.    By this time they were within a few rods of the blacksmith's yard, and  William became bold, now that he had nothing to lose by it.    \"My name isn't Christopher,\" he answered in his usual tone.    \"Your name isn't Christopher? That's what your uncle told me.\"    \"I think you are mistaken,\" said William quietly.    \"What's got into the boy? Is he goin' to deny his own name? What is your  name, then?\"    \"My name is William Morris,\" was the distinct response.    \"What!\" exclaimed the blacksmith in amazement.    \"I think you ought to know me, Mr. Bickford. I worked for you some time,  you know.\"    \"Take off your hat, and let me look at your face!\" said Aaron Bickford,  sternly.    William laughed as he complied with the request. It was now rather  lighter, and the blacksmith, peering into his face, saw that it was  indeed true--that the boy on the back seat was not Kit Watson at all,  but his ex-apprentice, William Morris.    \"It's Bill Morris, by the living jingo!\" he exclaimed. \"What do you say  to that, Sarah?\"    \"You're a master hand at managing boys, Aaron,\" said his wife  sarcastically.    \"How came you in the wagon, Bill Morris?\" demanded Bickford, not caring  to answer his wife.    \"The giant put me in,\" answered William.    \"Where is that boy, Christopher Watson?\"    \"I expect he is travelin' with the show, Mr. Bickford.\"    \"Who put you up to this mean trick?\" demanded the blacksmith,  wrathfully.    \"Kit Watson.\"    \"I've got an account to settle with you, William Morris. I s'pose you  think you've done something pretty smart.\"    \"I think he has, Aaron,\" said Mrs. Bickford, who seemed to take a  malicious pleasure in opening her husband's wounds afresh.    \"Mrs. Bickford, it isn't very creditable in you to triumph over your  husband, just after he's been spendin' fifty cents for your amusement.\"    \"Goodness knows, Mr. Bickford, you don't often take me to shows. I guess  what you spend that way won't ruin you.\"    While the married pair were indulging in their little recriminations,  William had managed to slip out of the wagon in the rear, and he was now  a rod away.    \"Good night, Mr. Bickford!\" he shouted. \"I'm much obliged to you for  bringing me home. It's saved me a long walk.\"    The blacksmith's reply was one that I do not care to record. He was  thoroughly angry and disgusted. If it hadn't been so late he would have  got out and tried to inflict punishment on William with his whip, but  the boy was too far away by this time to make this possible.          CHAPTER XIX.    STEPHEN WATSON VISITS OAKFORD.      On Monday as Mr. Bickford was about his work a carriage drove into the  yard, containing Stephen Watson and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#13)"],[1,".  Her beauty, her character were the realization of all my dreams. That  woman never left me; she died in my house, in my arms, loving to the  last. Well, when I think of her, it is with a feeling of rage. If I  strive to recall her, the same as I ever saw her during those five  years, in all the radiance of love, with her lithe yielding figure, the  gilded pallor of her cheeks, her oriental Jewish features, regular and  delicate in the soft roundness of her face, her slow speech as velvety  as her glance, if I seek to embody that charming vision, it is only in  order the more fiercely to cry to it: \"I hate you!\"    Her name was Clotilde. At the house of the mutual acquaintances where we  met, she was known under the name of Madame Deloche, and was said to be  the widow of a captain in the merchant service. Indeed, she appeared to  have travelled a great deal. In the course of conversation, she would  suddenly say: When I was at Tampico; or else: once in the harbour at  Valparaiso. But apart from this, there was no trace in her manners or  language of a wandering existence, nothing betrayed the disorder or  precipitation of sudden departures or abrupt returns. She was a thorough  Parisian, dressed in perfect good taste, without any of those bur-nooses  or eccentric _sarapes_ by which one recognizes the wives of officers and  sailors who are always arrayed in travelling costume.    [Illustration: p179-190]    When I found that I loved her, my first, my only idea was to ask her in  marriage. Someone spoke on my behalf. She simply replied that she would  never marry again. Henceforth I avoided meeting her; and as my thoughts  were too wholly absorbed and occupied by her to allow me to work,  I determined to travel. I was busily engaged in preparations for my  departure, when one morning, in my own apartment, in the midst of all  the litter of opened drawers and scattered trunks, to my great surprise,  I saw Madame Deloche enter.    \"Why are you leaving?\" she said softly. \"Because you love me? I also  love. I love you. Only (and here her voice shook a little) only, I am  married.\" And she told me her history.    It was a romance of love and desertion. Her husband drank, struck her!  At the end of three years they had separated Her family, of whom she  seemed very proud, held a high position in Paris, but ever since her  marriage had refused to receive her. She was the niece of the Chief  Rabbi. Her sister, the widow of a superior officer, had married for the  second time a Chief Ranger of the woods and forests of Saint-Germain. As  for her, ruined by her husband, she had fortunately had a very thorough  education and possessed some accomplishments, by which she was able to  augment her resources. She gave music lessons in various rich houses  of the Chaussee d'Antin and Faubourg Saint Honore, and gained an ample  livelihood.    The story was touching, although somewhat lengthy, full of the  pretty repetitions, the interminable incidents that entangle feminine  discourse.    [Illustration: p181-192]    Indeed she took several days to relate it. I had hired for us two, a  little house in the Avenue de l'Imperatrice, standing between the silent  streets and peaceful lawns. I could have spent a year listening to and  looking at her, without a thought for my work. She was the first to send  me back to my studio, and I could not prevent her from again taking up  her lessons. I was touched by her concern for the dignity of her life.  I admired the proud spirit, notwithstanding that I could not help being  rather humiliated at her expressed determination to owe nothing save to  her own exertions. We were therefore separated all day long, and only  met in the evening in our little house.    With what joy did I not return home, what impatience I felt when she was  late, and how happy I was when I found her there before me! She would  bring me back bouquets and choice flowers from her journeys to Paris.  Often I pressed upon her some present, but she laughingly said she was  richer than I; and in truth her lessons must have been very well paid,  for she always dressed in an expensively elegant manner, and the black  dresses which, with coquettish care for her complexion and style of  beauty she preferred, had the dull softness of velvet, the brilliancy  of satin and jet, a confusion of silken lace, which revealed to the  astonished eye, under an apparent simplicity, a world of feminine  elegance in the thousand shades contained in a single colour.    [Illustration: p183-194]    Moreover her occupation was by no means laborious, she said. All her  pupils, daughters of bankers or stock brokers, loved and respected her;  and many a time she would show me a bracelet or a ring, that had been  presented as a mark of gratitude for her care. Except for our work, we  never left one another, and we went nowhere. Only on Sundays she went  off to Saint-Germain to see her sister, the wife of the Chief Ranger,  with whom she was now reconciled. I would accompany her to the station.  She would return the same evening, and often in the long summer days, we  would agree to meet at some station on the way, by the riverside or in  the woods. She would tell me about her visit, the children's good looks,  the air of happiness that reigned in the household. My heart bled for  her, deprived of the pleasures of family life as she was doomed to be;  and my tenderness increased tenfold in order to make her forget the  falseness of her position, so painful to a woman of her character.    What a happy time of perfect confidence, and how well I worked! I  suspected nothing. All she said seemed so true, so natural. I could only  reproach her with one thing. When talking of the houses she frequented,  and the different families of her pupils, she would indulge in a  superabundance of imaginary details and fancied intrigues, which she  invented without any _apropos_.    [Illustration: p185-196]    Calm herself, she was ever conjuring up romances around her, and her  life was spent in composing dramatic situations. These idle fancies  disturbed my happiness. I, who longed to leave the world and society, in  order to devote myself exclusively to her, found her too much taken up  by indifferent subjects. However, I could easily excuse this defect in a  young and unhappy woman, whose life had been hitherto a sad romance, the  issue of which could not be foreseen.    Once only did a suspicion or rather a presentiment cross my mind. One  Sunday evening she failed to return home. I was in despair. What could  I do? Go to Saint-Germain? I might compromise her. Nevertheless, after a  dreadful night of anguish, I had decided on starting, when she arrived,  looking pale and worried. Her sister was ill, she had been obliged to  stay and nurse her. I believed all she told me, not distrusting the  overflow of words called forth by the slightest question, which swamped  the principal matter in a deluge of idle details: such as the hour of  arrival, the rudeness of a guard, the lateness of the train. Twice or  three times in the same week, she returned to Saint-Germain and slept  there; then, her sister's illness over, she resumed her regular and  peaceful existence.    [Illustration: p187-198]    Unfortunately, shortly after this, she in her turn fell ill. She came  back one day from her lessons, shivering, wet, and fevered. Inflammation  of the lungs set in; from the first her case was serious, and soon--the  doctor told me--hopeless. My despair was maddening. Then I thought only  of soothing her last moments. The family she loved so well, of which she  was so proud, I would bring to her deathbed. Without letting her know,  I first wrote to her sister at Saint-Germain, and I went off at  once myself to her uncle, the Chief Rabbi. I hardly remember at what  unreasonable hour I reached his house. Great catastrophes throw such a  confusion into life and upset every detail. I fancy the good Rabbi was  dining. He came out into the hall, wondering and amazed, to speak to me.    \"Monsieur,\" I said to him, \"there are moments when all hatred must  cease.\"    He turned his venerable face towards me with a bewildered look.    I resumed:    \"Your niece is dying!\"    \"My niece! But I have no niece; you are mistaken.\"    \"Oh, Sir! I implore you, lay aside all foolish family rancour. I am  speaking of Madame Deloche, the wife of Captain----\"    \"I do not know Madame Deloche. You are mistaken, my son, I assure you.\"    And he gently pushed me toward the door, taking me for a hoaxer or  a madman. I must in fact have appeared very odd. What I heard was so  unexpected, so terrible. She had lied to me then. Wherefore?    Suddenly an idea flashed across me. I directed the cabman to drive me  to the address of one of those pupils of whom she had so often spoken to  me, the daughter of a well-known banker.    I inquired of the servant: \"Madame Deloche?\"    \"There is no one here of that name.\"    \"Yes, I know that. It is a lady who gives music lessons to your young  ladies.\"    \"We have no young ladies here, not even a piano. I don't know what you  mean.\"    And he angrily shut the door in my face.    I made no further inquiries. I felt sure of meeting with the same  answer, the same disappointment. On my return to our little house,  they gave me a letter with the postmark of Saint-Germain. I opened  it, instinctively guessing the contents. The Chief Ranger also had no  knowledge of Madame Deloche. Moreover he had neither wife nor child.    This was the last blow. Thus for five years each of her words had been  a lie. A thousand jealous thoughts took possession of me, and madly,  hardly knowing what I was about, I entered the room in which she was  dying. All the questions that were torturing me burst forth over that  bed of suffering: \"Why did you go to Saint-Germain on Sundays? Where did  you spend your days? Where did you spend that night? Come, answer  me.\" And I bent over her, seeking"]]]
