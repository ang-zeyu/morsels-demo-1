The furs were at first found and profitably  gathered, but the timid fur-bearing animals were soon exterminated near  the settlements. There was, however, a vast wealth ready for the  colonists on the coast of the New World which was greater than gold,  greater than furs; a wealth ever-obtainable, ever-replenished,  ever-useful, ever-salable; it was _fish_. The sea, the rivers, the  lakes, teemed with fish. Not only was there food for the settlers, but  for the whole world, and all Europe desired fish to eat. The ships of  the early discoverer, Gosnold, in 1602, were \"pestered with cod.\"  Captain John Smith, the acute explorer, famous in history as befriended  by Pocahontas, went to New England, in 1614, to seek for whale, and  instead he fished for cod. He secured sixty thousand in one month; and  he wrote to his countrymen, \"Let not the meanness of the word _fish_  distaste you, for it will afford as good gold as the mines of Guiana or  Potosi, with less hazard and charge, and more certainty and facility.\"  This promise of wealth has proved true a thousandfold. Smith wrote home  to England full accounts of the fisheries, of the proper equipment of a  fishing-vessel, of the methods of fishing, the profits, all in a most  enticing and familiar style. He said in his _Description of New  England_:--         \"What pleasure can be more than to recreate themselves before their       owne doores in their owne boates, upon the Sea, where man, woman,       and childe, with a small hooke and line by angling, may take       diverse sorts of excellent fish, at their pleasure? And is it not       pretty sport to pull up twopence, sixpence, or twelvepence, as fast       as you can hale and veare a line? If a man worke but three days in       seaven hee may get more than hee can spend unless hee will be       excessive.         \"Young boyes and girles, salvages, or any other, be they never such       idlers may turne, carry, and returne fish without shame or either       great pain: hee is very idle that is past twelve years of age and       cannot doe so much: and shee is very old that cannot spin a thread       to catch them.\"    His accounts and similar ones were so much read in England that when the  Puritans asked King James of England for permission to come to America,  and the king asked what profit would be found by their emigration, he  was at once answered, \"Fishing.\" Whereupon he said in turn, \"In truth  'tis an honest trade; 'twas the apostles' own calling.\" Yet in spite of  their intent to fish, the first English ships came but poorly provided  for fishing, and the settlers had little success at first even in  getting fish for their own food. Elder Brewster of Plymouth, who had  been a courtier in Queen Elizabeth's time, and had seen and eaten many  rich feasts, had nothing to eat at one time but clams. Yet he could give  thanks to God that he was \"permitted to suck of the abundance of the  seas and the treasures hid in the sand.\" The Indian Squanto showed the  Pilgrims many practical methods of fishing, among them one of treading  out eels from the brook with his feet and catching them with his hands.  And every ship brought in either cod-hooks and lines, mackerel-hooks and  lines, herring-nets, seines, shark-hooks, bass-nets, squid-lines,  eel-pots, coils of rope and cable, \"drails, barbels, pens, gaffs,\" or  mussel-hooks.    Josselyn, in his _New England's Rarities_, written in 1672, enumerated  over two hundred kinds of fish that were caught in New England waters.    Lobsters certainly were plentiful enough to prevent starvation. The  minister Higginson, writing of lobsters at Salem, said that many of them  weighed twenty-five pounds apiece, and that \"the least boy in the  plantation may catch and eat what he will of them.\" In 1623, when the  ship _Anne_ arrived from England, bringing many of the wives and  children of the Pilgrims who had come in the first ships, the only  feast of welcome that the poor husbands had to offer the newcomers was  \"a lobster or a piece of fish without bread or anything else but a cup  of spring water.\"    Patriarchal lobsters five and six feet long were caught in New York Bay.  The traveller, Van der Donck, says \"those a foot long are better for  serving at table.\" Truly a lobster six feet long would seem a little  awkward to serve on a dinner table. Eddis, in his _Letters from  America_, written in 1792, says these vast lobsters were caught in New  York waters until Revolutionary days, when \"since the incessant  cannonading, they have entirely forsaken the coast; not one having been  taken or seen since the commencement of hostilities.\" Beside these great  shell-fish the giant lobster confined in our New York Aquarium in 1897  seems but a dwarf. In Virginia waters lobsters were caught, and vast  crabs, often a foot in length and six inches broad, with a long tail and  many legs. One of these crabs furnished a sufficient meal for four men.    From the gossiping pages of the Labadist missionaries who came to  America in 1697 we find hints of good fare in oysters in Brooklyn.         \"Then was thrown upon the fire, to be roasted, a pail full of       Gowanes oysters which are the best in the country. They are fully       as good as those of England, better than those we eat at Falmouth.       I had to try some of them raw. They are large and full, some of       them not less than a foot long. Others are young and small. In       consequence of the great quantities of them everybody keeps the       shells for the burning of lime. They pickle the oysters in small       casks and send them to Barbados.\"    Van der Donck corroborates the foot-long oysters seen by the Labadist  travellers. He says the \"large oysters roasted or stewed make a good  bite,\"--a very good bite, it would seem to us.    Strachey, in his _Historie of Travaile into Virginia_, says he saw  oysters in Virginia that were thirteen inches long. Fortunately for the  starving Virginians, oyster banks rose above the surface at ebb-tide at  the mouth of the Elizabeth River, and in 1609 a large number of these  famished Virginia colonists found in these oyster banks a means of  preservation of life.    As might be expected of any country so intersected with arms of the sea  and fresh-water streams, Virginia at the time of settlement teemed with  fish. The Indians killed them in the brooks by striking them with  sticks, and it is said the colonists scooped them up in frying-pans.  Horses ridden into the rivers stepped on the fish and killed them. In  one cast of a seine the governor, Sir Thomas Dale, caught five thousand  sturgeon as large as cod. Some sturgeon were twelve feet long. The works  of Captain John Smith, Rolfe's _Relation_, and other books of early  travellers, all tell of the enormous amount of fish in Virginia.    The New York rivers were also full of fish, and the bays; their plenty  in New Netherland inspired the first poet of that colony to rhyming  enumeration of the various kinds of fish found there; among them were  sturgeon--beloved of the Indians and despised of Christians; and  terrapin--not despised by any one. \"Some persons,\" wrote the Dutch  traveller, Van der Donck, in 1656, \"prepare delicious dishes from the  water terrapin, which is luscious food.\" The Middle and Southern states  paid equally warm but more tardy tribute to the terrapin's reputation as  luscious food.    While other fish were used everywhere for food, cod was the great staple  of the fishing industry. By the year 1633 Dorchester and Marblehead had  started in the fisheries for trading purposes. Sturgeon also was caught  at a little later date, and bass and alewives.    Morton, in his _New England Canaan_, written in 1636, says, \"I myself at  the turning of the tyde have seen such multitudes of sea bass that it  seemed to me that one might goe over their backs dri-shod.\"    The regulation of fish-weirs soon became an important matter in all  towns where streams let alewives up from the sea. The New England  ministers took a hand in promoting and encouraging the fisheries, as  they did all positive social movements and commercial benefits. Rev.  Hugh Peter in Salem gave the fisheries a specially good turn. Fishermen  were excused from military training, and portions of the common stock of  corn were assigned to them. The General Court of Massachusetts exempted  \"vessels and stock\" from \"country charges\" (which were taxes) for seven  years. Seashore towns assigned free lands to each boat to be used for  stays and flakes for drying. As early as 1640 three hundred thousand  dried codfish were sent to market from New England.    Codfish consisted of three sorts, \"marchantable, middling, and refuse.\"  The first grade was sold chiefly to Roman Catholic Europe, to supply the  constant demands of the fast-days of that religion, and also those of  the Church of England; the second was consumed at home or in the  merchant vessels of New England; the third went to the negroes of the  West Indies, and was often called Jamaica fish. The dun-fish or  dumb-fish, as the word was sometimes written, were the best; so called  from the dun-color. Fish was always eaten in New England for a Saturday  dinner; and Mr. Palfrey, the historian, says that until this century no  New England dinner on Saturday, even a formal dinner party, was complete  without dun-fish being served.    Of course the first fishing-vessels had to be built and sent from  England. Some carried fifty men. They arrived on the coast in early  spring, and by midsummer sailed home. The crew had for wages one-third  share of the fish and oil; another third paid for the men's food, the  salt, nets, hooks, lines, etc.; the other third went to the ship's  owners for profit.    This system was not carried out in New England. There, each fisherman "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],[0,"Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#13)"],[1,"it in principle as imposed for the serving of  the national rights.\" [1]  By his organs, too, the King was described  as \"a worthy successor of the Constantines who created the mighty  Byzantine Empire--imbued with a sense of his great national  mission--Greek in heart and mind.\" [2]  So anxious, indeed, was M.  Venizelos not to lose votes by any display of ill-feeling against the  popular sovereign that he even took some pains to have himself  photographed calling at the Palace to inquire after the King's health.    As to policy, it is difficult to determine the part which it played in  the contest.  M. Venizelos refrained from publishing any sort of  programme.  His opponents asserted that a vote for Venizelos meant a  vote for war.  But his most prominent supporters declared that such was  by no means the case: although, at a certain moment, he was ready to  participate in the Gallipoli enterprise, circumstances had changed, and  his future course would depend on the situation which he would find on  returning to {51} power.  This vagueness, though not very helpful to  the voters, doubtless helped the voting; for there was hardly any  pro-war feeling among the masses.  The noble ideals emblazoned upon the  Entente banners produced little impression on their minds.  The  experience of two thousand years has taught the Greeks that Governments  never fight for noble ideals, and, if they relieve a small nation from  a foreign yoke, it is, as often as not, in order to impose a new one.  To them the War was a struggle for power and plunder between two  European groups.  It was matter of common knowledge that Constantinople  had been allotted to the Russians, and the Greeks were not particularly  keen on shedding their blood in order to place a Tsar on the Byzantine  throne.  Nor did the Smyrna bait attract them greatly, since it  involved parting with Cavalla.  At the same time, the lurid accounts of  German frightfulness disseminated by the Entente propaganda, instead of  inflaming, damped still further their enthusiasm.[3]  The Venizelist  candidates were, therefore, wise in repudiating the allegation that  their victory would inevitably mean intervention in the conflict; and,  on the whole, the people who voted for the Cretan statesman seem to  have paid a tribute to his personality rather than to his policy.    Meanwhile, Servia, under pressure from the Entente, had decided to  promise Bulgaria territorial concessions, and the communication of this  decision to the Hellenic Government formed the occasion of M.  Venizelos's first official act.  Greece, he wrote in reply, not wishing  to embarrass her friend and ally at a moment when imperative necessity  forced the latter to submit to painful sacrifices, abandoned her  objections.  But she would be lacking in sincerity if she failed to  tell Servia straightway that \"the _raison d'etre_ of the  Alliance--namely, the territorial equilibrium and the mutual guarantee  of their respective possessions--being profoundly affected by the  contemplated changes, the reciprocal obligations of the Alliance could  not survive except by virtue of a renewal.\"  M. Passitch replied  verbally that he thought like M. Venizelos.  But, as it happened, the  question did not arise; Servia's promise was coupled with so many  stipulations and reservations, that, in the opinion of the Entente  Powers, {52} it amounted almost to a refusal;[4] and the thread of the  negotiations was very soon broken by events.  Destiny moved too fast  for diplomacy.    Hardly had these dispatches been exchanged, when Colonel Vlachopoulos,  the emissary of the Greek General Staff to Servia, arrived in Athens,  bringing a report of the gravest nature.  After twelve months'  evasions, the Servian Minister of War had at last mentioned to him the  need for an understanding between the two Staffs, and the Servian  Director of Military Operations stated that Servia, far from being able  to contribute to a common struggle against Bulgaria the 150,000  combatants stipulated by the Graeco-Servian Convention, could not at  the moment transport to the northern parts of the Bulgarian frontier  more than one or two divisions, while as to the southern parts, which  most immediately concerned Greece, they would have to be left with the  eight regiments of 1915 conscripts--that is, raw recruits.  Simultaneously, the fear which the Greek military authorities had  expressed to their Servian colleagues in the previous spring--that  delay might prove fatal--was being realized: from all sides came  intelligence of the concentration of large Austro-German forces towards  the Danube.    In the circumstances, after studying Colonel Vlachopoulos's report, the  Greek General Staff submitted to the Government (14 September) the  opinion that for Greece to embark on a war against Bulgaria, so long as  she was not assured of the co-operation of adequate Servian forces, was  tantamount to courting annihilation; and of such co-operation there was  no prospect: the moment the Serbs found themselves faced by a superior  Austro-German army, the Greeks would have to fight the Bulgars as well  as, in all probability, the Turks alone.    As if in confirmation of this forecast, a week later (21 September),  the Hellenic Government received from Sofia the official announcement  of the conclusion of a Turco-Bulgarian agreement and of Bulgarian  mobilization; the latter measure being, according to the Bulgarian  Premier, purely precautionary: as the Austro-German {53} armies had  just begun an attack on Servia, and the theatre of war approached the  Bulgarian frontiers, his country was obliged to take up an attitude of  armed neutrality.[5]    The news threw M. Venizelos into a fever of excitement.  He had,  meanwhile, become most solicitous about Greece-Servian co-operation,  and had not permitted his mind to be impressed by Colonel  Vlachopoulos's report.  When Austria and Germany had their hands full  elsewhere, Servia's peril had left him cold; it set him on fire now  when they were ready to hurl their legions into the Balkan  Peninsula--when it was no longer for Greece a question of fighting  Bulgaria only, but Bulgaria and Turkey and the Central Empires.  M.  Venizelos was a statesman of broad ideas, a hater of dry facts, and an  impenitent believer in his own star.  For the matter of time he cared  very little; considerations of odds did not weigh with him unduly; and  he cherished a sovereign contempt for the cautious attitude of  professional soldiers and other uninspired persons.  Never did these  qualities appear more vividly than on this 21st of September.    At 5 p.m. M. Venizelos went to Tatoi, the King's country residence, to  confer with him, having previously arranged that a mobilization Order  should be drawn up and presented to his Majesty for signature at 6.30  p.m., by which time he expected to have finished his conversation.  The  following is a synopsis of that memorable interview based on a report  from M. Venizelos's own lips.[6]    The King readily agreed to mobilize, but firmly resisted the proposal  to enter the war, on the ground that the odds were too heavy.  M.  Venizelos argued that, even if Germany had five million men available  on other fronts, she could not bring them to the Balkans, and  consequently there was no cause for fear: he spoke learnedly and at  enormous length of geographical conditions and means of transport, of  victualling, of guns and bayonets, of _morale_--he had allowed himself  an hour and a half.  How the King must have felt under this harangue,  any expert who has had to listen to an amateur laying down the law to  him on his own subject may imagine.  On finding his military arguments  fruitless, M. Venizelos shifted his ground; though, the military habit  being too strong, he {54} could not get away from military phraseology:  \"I was then obliged,\" he tells us, \"to bring forward my heavy  artillery.\"    \"Majesty,\" I said, \"I have not succeeded in persuading you.  I am very  sorry; but it is my duty, as representing at this moment the  Sovereignty of the People, to tell you that you have no right to  disagree with me this time.  The people by the last elections has  approved my policy and given me its confidence.  It knew that the basis  of my policy was not to let Bulgaria, by crushing Servia, become too  big and crush us to-morrow.  You cannot therefore at this moment depart  from this policy--unless you decide to set aside the Constitution; in  which case you must say so clearly, abrogating the Constitution by a  Decree and assuming the responsibility.\"    The King replied: \"You know I recognize that I am bound to obey the  popular verdict when it is a question of the internal affairs of the  country; but when it is a question of foreign affairs--the great  national questions--my view is that, so long as I consider a thing  right or wrong, I must insist that it shall or shall not be done,  because I feel responsible before God.\"    At this utterance, M. Venizelos narrates, \"I remember that a feeling of  distress came over me, and with clasped hands, I shook my head in a  melancholy manner, saying: 'Alas! we are before the theory of kingship  by the grace of God: poor Greece!'\" [7]  After a little, he told the  King that, in the actual circumstances, he could not undertake a  struggle for the Constitution; he could only tender his resignation.    The King expostulated: \"How can you resign in the face of a Bulgarian  mobilization?  In these circumstances, as you know, we must not delay  even twenty-four hours.  After all, who assures us that Bulgaria will  attack Servia?  It is possible that she may maintain an armed  neutrality; in which case our disagreement vanishes, and you can stay  in power and carry on your policy.\"  Whereupon M. Venizelos withdrew  his resignation.    Of course, he was not deluded by the Sofia Government's {55}  announcement of \"armed neutrality,\" and he was"]]]
