[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20763"],[0,"Carpentry for Boys (#13)"],[1,"  case we have formed an ovate or an oval form. Experience will soon make  perfect in following out these directions.    FOCAL POINTS.--The focal point of a circle is its center, and is called  the _focus_. But an ellipse has two focal points, called _foci_,  represented by F, F in Fig. 148, and by B, B in Fig. 149.    A _produced line_ is one which extends out beyond the marking point.  Thus in Fig. 148 that part of the line K between F and G represents the  produced portion of line K.    [Illustration: _Fig. 149._]    SPIRALS.--There is no more difficult figure to make with a bow or a  circle pen than a spiral. In Fig. 150 a horizontal and a vertical line  (A, B), respectively, are drawn, and at their intersection a small  circle (C) is formed. This now provides for four centering points for  the circle pen, on the two lines (A, B). Intermediate these points  indicate a second set of marks halfway between the marks on the lines.  If you will now set the point of the compass at, say, the mark 3, and  the pencil point of the compass at D, and make a curved mark one-eighth  of the way around, say, to the radial line (E), then put the point of  the compass to 4, and extend the pencil point of the compass so it  coincides with the curved line just drawn, and then again make another  curve, one-eighth of a complete circle, and so on around the entire  circle of marking points, successively, you will produce a spiral,  which, although not absolutely accurate, is the nearest approach with a  circle pen. To make this neatly requires care and patience.    [Illustration: _Fig. 150._]    PERPENDICULAR AND VERTICAL.--A few words now as to terms. The boy is  often confused in determining the difference between _perpendicular_ and  _vertical_. There is a pronounced difference. Vertical means up and  down. It is on a line in the direction a ball takes when it falls  straight toward the center of the earth. The word _perpendicular_, as  usually employed in astronomy, means the same thing, but in geometry, or  in drafting, or in its use in the arts it means that a perpendicular  line is at right angles to some other line. Suppose you put a square  upon a roof so that one leg of the square extends up and down on the  roof, and the other leg projects outwardly from the roof. In this case  the projecting leg is _perpendicular_ to the roof. Never use the word  _vertical_ in this connection.    SIGNS TO INDICATE MEASUREMENTS.--The small circle ( deg.) is always used to  designate _degree_. Thus 10 deg. means ten degrees.    Feet are indicated by the single mark '; and two closely allied marks \"  are for inches. Thus five feet ten inches should be written 5' 10\". A  large cross (x) indicates the word \"by,\" and in expressing the term six  feet by three feet two inches, it should be written 6' x 3'2\".    The foregoing figures give some of the fundamentals necessary to be  acquired, and it may be said that if the boy will learn the principles  involved in the drawings he will have no difficulty in producing  intelligible work; but as this is not a treatise on drawing we cannot go  into the more refined phases of the subject.    DEFINITIONS.--The following figures show the various geometrical forms  and their definitions:    [Illustration: _Fig. 151.-Fig. 165._]    151. _Abscissa._--The point in a curve, A, which is referred to by  certain lines, such as B, which extend out from an axis, X, or the  ordinate line Z.    152. _Angle._--The inclosed space near the point where two lines meet.    153. _Apothegm._--The perpendicular line A from the center to one side  of a regular polygon.

A double involute.    157. _Conic Section._--Having the form of or resembling a cone. Formed  by cutting off a cone at any angle. See line A.    158. _Conoid._--Anything that has a form resembling that of a cone.    159. _Cycloid._--A curve, A, generated by a point, B, in the plane of a  circle or wheel, C, when the wheel is rolled along a straight line.    160. _Ellipsoid._--A solid, all plane sections of which are ellipses or  circles.    161. _Epicycloid._--A curve, A, traced by a point, B, in the  circumference of a wheel, C, which rolls on the convex side of a fixed  circle, D.    162. _Evolute._--A curve, A, from which another curve, like B, on each  of the inner ends of the lines C is made. D is a spool, and the lines C  represent a thread at different positions. The thread has a marker, E,  so that when the thread is wound on the spool the marker E makes the  evolute line A.    163. _Focus._--The center, A, of a circle; also one of the two centering  points, B, of an ellipse or an oval.    164. _Gnome._--The space included between the boundary lines of two  similar parallelograms, the one within the other, with an angle in  common.    165. _Hyperbola._--A curve, A, formed by the section of a cone. If the  cone is cut off vertically on the dotted line, A, the curve is a  hyperbola. See _Parabola_.

CHAPTER IX    MOLDINGS, WITH PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS IN EMBELLISHING WORK      MOLDINGS.--The use of moldings was early resorted to by the nations of  antiquity, and we marvel to-day at many of the beautiful designs which  the Ph[oe]necians, the Greeks and the Romans produced. If you analyze  the lines used you will be surprised to learn how few are the designs  which go to make up the wonderful columns, spires, minarets and domes  which are represented in the various types of architecture.    THE BASIS OF MOLDINGS.--Suppose we take the base type of moldings, and  see how simple they are and then, by using these forms, try to build up  or ornament some article of furniture, as an example of their utility.    THE SIMPLEST MOLDING.--In Fig. 185 we show a molding of the most  elementary character known, being simply in the form of a band (A)  placed below the cap. Such a molding gives to the article on which it is  placed three distinct lines, C, D and E. If you stop to consider you  will note that the molding, while it may add to the strength of the  article, is primarily of service because the lines and surfaces produce  shadows, and therefore become valuable in an artistic sense.    THE ASTRAGAL.--Fig. 186 shows the ankle-bone molding, technically called  the _Astragal_. This form is round, and properly placed produces a good  effect, as it throws the darkest shadow of any form of molding.    [Illustration: _Fig. 185. Band._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 186. Astragal or Ankle Bone._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 187. Cavetto. Concave._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 188. Ovolo. Quarter round._]    THE CAVETTO.--Fig. 187 is the cavetto, or round type. Its proper use  gives a delicate outline, but it is principally applied with some other  form of molding.    THE OVOLO.--Fig. 188, called the ovolo, is a quarter round molding with  the lobe (A) projecting downwardly. It is distinguished from the  astragal because it casts less of a shadow above and below.    THE TORUS.--Fig. 189, known as the torus, is a modified form of the  ovolo, but the lobe (A) projects out horizontally instead of downwardly.    THE APOPHYGES (Pronounced apof-i-ges).--Fig. 190 is also called the  _scape_, and is a concaved type of molding, being a hollowed curvature  used on columns where its form causes a merging of the shaft with the  fillet.
