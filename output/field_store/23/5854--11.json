Really, gentlemen, I  am so deeply immersed in my studies that names escape me in a most  provoking manner.  A gentleman resident in the town here--a Sanskrit  scholar, and friend of Mr Morris.  Dear me!  What was his name?  There  was something familiar about it, and I made a mental note, _memoria  technica_, to be sure, yes--what was it?  I remember the word perfectly  now.  `Beer.'  Dear me, how strange!  And it doesn't help me a bit.  Really, gentlemen, I am afraid this _memoria technica_ is a mistake.  How, by any possibility could the name of the ordinary beverage of the  working classes have anything to do with the professor's name?  Professor Beer--Professor Ale--Professor Porter--Stout?  Dear me, how  strange!  Ah, of course--the great brewers, Barclay--Professor Barclay!  At half-past six.\"    \"Thank you, sir.  We will come,\" said Singh, smiling.    \"Precisely,\" said the Doctor, and he stood smiling in the doorway as the  boys passed out.    They were at the end of the hall passage when the door closed, and  Wrench shot out from somewhere like a Jack from its box.    \"Aren't caught it very bad, gentlemen, have you?\" he cried eagerly.    \"Oh no, Wrench,\" said Glyn, smiling.    \"Thought not, sir, for the Doctor had got a twinkle in his eye when he'd  done with the wild-beast man.  It would have been hard if you'd caught  it after what you did.  Pst!  There's the study-bell.\"  And the man  hurried away, leaving the culprits to stroll out together into the  playground, where they found fully half the boys waiting to hear the  result of their interview with the Doctor, Slegge and his courtiers  hurrying up first.    \"Well, beast-tamers,\" he cried sneeringly, \"how many lines of Latin have  you got to do?\"  And he grinned offensively at them both.    \"When?\" said Glyn coolly.    \"When?  Why, now, at once.\"    \"We haven't got any lines of Latin to do,\" said Singh quietly.  \"To-day  is a holiday.\"    \"For us,\" cried Slegge; \"but I know the Doctor.  You have both got a  pretty stiff dose to do, my fine fellows, and I wish you joy.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Glyn; \"but you are all in the wrong.\"    \"Wrong?  Then what did the Doctor say to you?\"    \"Oh,\" said Glyn, in a most imperturbable manner, fighting hard the  while, though, to keep his countenance as he realised the strength of  the shot he was about to send at his malicious persecutor, \"he asked  Singh and me to come and meet the masters and dine with him to-night.\"        CHAPTER NINE.    THE NEW PROFESSOR.    \"Let 'em go,\" snarled Slegge to his courtiers.  \"It's only another way  of getting a hard lesson.  I know what the Doctor's dinner-parties are.  Let the stuck-up young brutes go.  But if I wasn't about to leave the  blessed old school I would jolly soon let the Doctor know that this sort  of thing won't do.  The old humbug told me once that fairplay was a  jewel.  I don't call it fairplay to be currying favour with a new boy  because he's an Indian prince.  Indian prince, indeed!  Indian bear--  cub; that's what I call him, with his leader, currying favour like that!  Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!  Haw, haw!\"    This was a melodramatic laugh of the most sarcastic description,  prefatory to the letting off of a very ponderous joke.  \"Currying!  Indian curry!  That's what he was brought up on.  Curry and rice instead  of pap.  Look at the colour of his skin.  But only wait a bit,\"  continued Slegge darkly.  \"Just wait till the right time comes, and I'll  let you all see.\"    But the Doctor's dinner-party was not quite so ponderous and learned as  usual, for the incidents of the day formed the main topic of  conversation.  The Doctor was in high good-humour, and naturally felt  rather proud of his pupils.  They had distinguished themselves, and in  so doing had distinguished him and his school, and the consequence was  that the masters readily took up the subject and were most warm and  friendly to the two lads, the other guest in particular, Professor  Barclay, as Morris took care that he should be called, much to the  annoyance of the classical master, who looked at the new-comer, Morris's  friend, rather suspiciously, regarding him as one likely to poach upon  his preserves.    During the dinner, the Professor had much to say about Sanskrit,  military colleges, and India, and was very attentive to Singh and Glyn,  but found the boys quiet and retiring in the extreme.    All, however, seemed to be enjoying themselves but Mr Rampson, who grew  more uneasy and suspicious over the coffee, pricking up his ears as he  bent over his cup and kept on stirring it, but without drinking, while  the Doctor and the Professor were talking together as if discussing some  subject in a low tone.    The fact must be recorded against the classical teacher that he was  eavesdropping, ungentlemanly as it may sound; but the only thing that  reached his ears was the conclusion of the conversation, when the Doctor  said, raising his voice slightly, \"Certainly, Mr Barclay, I shall give  every attention to your testimonials; but my staff of preceptors is  complete, and I have always considered Greek and Latin sufficient for my  pupils, of course with the modern languages thrown in.\"    The Professor thanked the Doctor effusively, and in the course of the  evening contrived to fix himself like a burr upon Singh, while Mr  Rampson made an effort and secured Glyn to himself, jealously taking  care that the stranger guest and friend, it seemed, of Morris should not  monopolise both the boys.    \"It's all a plot,\" said Rampson to himself--\"all a scheme to oust me,  and I'll never forgive Morris so long as I live.--I say,\" he said aloud,  \"that Mr Barclay seems to have a deal to say to your friend the Prince.  Do you know what they are talking about?\"    \"India, and Sanskrit, and catching elephants,\" replied Glyn.  \"Has he  been out in India?\"    \"Oh, don't ask me,\" said Rampson with asperity; then correcting himself  quickly, and with a rather ghastly smile, \"I say, you two did  distinguish yourselves to-day.\"    \"Oh, did we, sir?\" said Glyn, who looked rather tired and bored.  \"Please don't say more about it.\"    \"Oh no, of course not, if you don't want to hear it.  But your friend  doesn't seem to mind.  Why, the Professor's taking him out into the  garden, and the Prince is talking to him as hard as ever he can.  Yes,  he doesn't seem to mind.\"    \"No,\" replied Glyn, as he saw Singh, in obedience to a gesture from his  new acquaintance, sit down upon one of the garden-seats, and for the  next quarter of an hour the boy was talking in quite an animated way,  and evidently answering questions put to him by the Professor.    The evening soon glided away, and the boys gladly thanked their host and  retired to their own room, utterly wearied out by the events of the day.    As a rule, they lay for some time carrying on conversation and  discussing the next day's work; but that night very little was said, and  the only thing worth recording was a few sentences that were spoken and  responded to by Singh in the midst of yawns.    \"Talking about India and Sanskrit?\" said Glyn.    \"Oh yes; he asked me all sorts of questions about Dour, and he asked me  if I had ever seen Sanskrit letters.\"    \"Well?\"    \"And I told him I had, and he shook his head and asked me where I had  seen them.\"    \"Well, what did you say?\"    \"That I had got some precious stones in my box with some Sanskrit  letters cut in.\"    \"Why, you never were so stupid as to tell him about that belt?\"    \"I don't know that there's anything stupid in it,\" replied Singh  sleepily.  \"I didn't want him to think I was so ignorant as not to know  about a language that your father can read as easily as English, and has  talked to us about scores of times.  Why, of course, I did.\"    \"Well, of all the old _Dummkopfs_ I ever knew, you are the stupidest.  Didn't I tell you that--\" _Snore_.    \"Why, if he isn't asleep!\"    Almost the next moment Glyn was in the same state.        CHAPTER TEN.    \"ENGLISH GENTLEMEN DON'T FIGHT LIKE THAT.\"    The next morning the men sent by Ramball, the proprietor of the  world-famed menagerie, were busy at work first thing repairing hedge and  fence; and everything was so well done, and such prompt payment made for  the estimated damages to the neighbouring orchard, that when a  petition-like appeal for patronage was made by Ramball, the owner of the  orchard attended with wife, family, and friends; and the Doctor gave  permission to the whole school to be present, being moved also, as he  told the lads in a brief address, to go himself with the masters and  support a very worthy enterprise for the diffusion of natural history  throughout the country.  The visits were paid to the great yellow-walled  prison, and Ramball, in his best blue coat, the one with the basket-work  treble-gilt buttons, attended on the Doctor himself to explain the  peculiarities of the beasts and give their history in his own fashion.    This was peculiar, and did not in any way resemble a zoological lecture.  Still, it was an improvement upon the wild-beast showman of the  old-fashioned fairs, and he did not inform his listeners that the tiger  was eight feet six inches long from the tip of his nose to the end of  his tail, and exactly eight feet four inches long from the tip of his  tail to the end of his nose.  Neither did he impart knowledge, like  another of his craft, and tell people that the boa-constrictor was  so-called because he constructed such pleasing images with his  serpentine form.  But he did inform them that the monstrous reptile he  possessed--one which, by the way, was only nine feet long--was always  furnished in the cold weather with sawdust into which he could burrow,  on account of the peculiarity always practised by creatures of its kind  of swallowing its own blankets; and he did deliver an eulogy on his big  black bear, and encourage the young gentlemen to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#13)"],[1,", give him something to keep him quiet,\" growled a voice.    \"No, no; get hold of his hands; that's right.  Serve this cockerel the  same.  Down with him, quick!\" cried the officer sharply; and in  obedience to his words the men hung on to poor Jem so tenaciously that  he was dragged down on the rough pavement, and a couple of men sat  panting upon him while his wrists were secured, and his voice silenced  by a great bandage right over his mouth.    \"You cowards!\"  Jem tried to roar, as, breathless with exertion,  bleeding from a sharp back-handed blow across the mouth, and giddy with  excitement and the effects of a rough encounter between his head and the  wall, Don made one more attempt to drag himself free, and then stood  panting and mastered by two strong men.    \"Show the light,\" said the officer, and the lanthorn was held close to  Don's face.    \"Well, if the boy can fight like that,\" said the officer, \"he shall.\"    \"Let us go,\" cried Don.  \"Help!  He--\"    A jacket was thrown over his head, as the officer said mockingly,--    \"He shall fight for his Majesty the king.  Now, my lads, quick.  Some  one coming, and the wrong sort.\"    Don felt himself lifted off his feet, and half smothered by the hot  jacket which seemed to keep him from breathing, he was hurried along two  or three of the lanes, growing more faint and dizzy every moment, till  in the midst of a curious nightmare-like sensation, lights began  suddenly to dance before his eyes; then all was darkness, and he knew no  more till he seemed to wake up from a curious sensation of sickness, and  to be listening to Jem Wimble, who would keep on saying in a stupid,  aggravating manner,--\"Mas' Don, are you there?\"    The question must have been repeated many times before Don could get rid  of the dizzy feeling of confusion and reply,--\"Yes; what do you want?\"    \"Oh, my poor lad!\" groaned Jem.  \"Here, can you come to me and untie  this?\"    \"Jem!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What does it mean?  Why is it so dark?  Where are we?\"    \"Don't ask everything at once, my lad, and I'll try to tell you.\"    \"Has the candle gone out, Jem?  Are we in the big cellar?\"    \"Yes, my lad,\" groaned Jem, \"we're in a big cellar.\"    \"Can't you find the candle?\" said Don, with his head humming and the  mental confusion on the increase.  \"There's a flint and steel on the  ledge over the door.\"    \"Is there, my lad?  I didn't know it,\" muttered Jem.  \"Jem, are you  there?\"    \"Yes, yes, my lad, I'm here.\"    \"Get a light, quick.  I must have fallen and hurt myself; my face  bleeds.\"    \"Oh, my poor dear lad!\"    \"Eh?  What do you mean?  You're playing tricks, Jem, and it's too bad.  Get a light.\"    \"My hands is tied fast behind me, Mas' Don,\" groaned Jem, \"and we're  pitched down here in a cellar.\"    \"What?\"    \"Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!  I don't mind for myself,\" groaned Jem, in his  despair, \"but what will she do?\"    \"Jem!\"    \"I often said I wished I could be took away, but I didn't mean it, Mas'  Don; I didn't mean it.  What will my Sally do?\"    \"Jem, are you mad?\" shouted Don.  \"This darkness--this cellar.  It's all  black, and I can't think; my head aches, and it's all strange.  Don't  play tricks.  Try and open the door and let's go.\"    \"What, don't you know what it all means, Mas' Don?\" groaned Jem.    \"No, I don't seem as if I could think.  What does it mean?\"    \"Mean, my lad?  Why, the press-gang's got us, and unless we can let 'em  know at home, we shall be took aboard ship and sent off to sea.\"    \"What?\"    The light had come--the mental light which drove away the cloud of  darkness which had obscured Don Lavington's brain.  He could think now,  and he saw once more the dark lane, the swinging lanthorn, and felt, as  it were, the struggle going on; and then, sitting up with his hands to  his throbbing head, he listened to a low moaning sound close at hand.    \"Jem,\" he said.  \"Jem!  Why don't you speak?\"    There was no answer, for it was poor Jem's turn now; the injuries he had  received in his desperate struggle for liberty had had their effect, and  he lay there insensible to the great trouble which had come upon him,  while it grew more terrible to Don, in the darkness of that cellar, with  every breath he drew.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    PRISONERS.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Don, starting up, as there was the sound of  bolts being shot back, and a light shone in upon the darkness.    Don could hardly believe it possible, but it was quite true.  In spite  of pain and anxiety, weariness had mastered him, and he had been asleep.    As the light shone in, Don could see Jem lying, apparently asleep, but  in a very uncomfortable position, and that they were in a low, arched  cellar, one which at some time had been used for storing casks; for in  one corner there were some mouldy staves, and, close by, a barrel, whose  hoops seemed to have slipped down, so that it was in a state of  collapse.    He had no time to see more, for half a dozen well-armed sailors came in  after a bluff-looking man, who crossed at once to the prisoners.    \"Hold the lanthorn here,\" he said sharply.  \"Now let's have a look at  you.\"    He examined their injuries in an experienced way, roughly, but not  unkindly.    \"All right, my lad,\" he said to Don; \"you will not die this time.  Now  you.\"    He spent longer over Jem, who roused up and looked at him curiously, as  if he did not quite understand.    \"Been rather rough with this one, my lads.\"    \"Couldn't help it,\" said one of the sailors; \"he fote so hard.  So did  this young chap too.\"    \"Nothing wrong with him, I daresay,\" said the bluff man.  \"No bones  broken.  All right in a day or two.\"    Don had been silent while Jem was examined, for he felt that this man  was either a doctor, or one who knew something about surgery; but as  soon as he had finished, the boy, whose indignation had been growing,  turned to him haughtily.    \"Now, sir!\" he exclaimed, \"have the goodness to explain the meaning of  this outrage.\"    \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" cried the bluff man.    \"It is nothing to laugh at, sir.  I insist upon knowing why we have been  ill-used and dragged here by your men.\"    \"Well crowed, my young cockerel,\" said the bluff man, laughing.  \"They  said you fought well with your fists, so you can with your tongue.\"    \"Insulting us now you have us down will not save you,\" cried Don  fiercely.    \"No, my lord,\" said the bluff man, as Jem rose up, shook his head, and  stood by Don.    The men laughed.    \"You coward!\" cried Don in hot anger; \"but you shall all suffer for it.  My uncle will set the law to work, and have you all punished.\"    \"Really, this is growing serious,\" said the bluff man in mock alarm.    \"You will find it no laughing matter.  You have made a mistake this  time; so now let us go at once.\"    \"Well, I would with pleasure, my noble captain,\" said the bluff man,  with mock solemnity; \"but his Majesty is in sore need just now of some  dashing young fellows who can fight; and he said to our first  lieutenant, `short of men, Mr Morrison?  Dear me, are you?  Well then,  the best thing you can do is to send round Bristol city, and persuade a  few of the brave and daring young fellows there to come on board my good  ship _Great Briton_, and help me till I've settled my quarrel with my  enemies,' so we have persuaded you.\"    \"You are adding insult to what you have done, sir.  Now let us pass.  You and your miserable press-gang shall smart for this.  Stand aside,  sir.\"    \"What, after taking all this trouble?  Hardly.\"    \"Here, I'm all right again now, Mas' Don.  Press-gang, eh?\" cried Jem.  \"Here, let me get at him.\"    Jem made a dash at the bluff man, but his arms were seized, and he was  held back, struggling hard.    \"Ah, I wish we had fifty of you,\" said the bluff man.  \"Don't hurt him,  my lads.  There, there, steady; you can't do anything.  That will do.  Save your strength to fight for the king.\"    \"You cowards!\" cried Jem, who suddenly turned so faint that the men  easily mastered him, laid him on his back, and one held him down, while  another held Don till the rest had passed out, the bluff man only  standing at the entrance with another holding up the light.    \"Come along,\" he shouted; and the man who held Jem left him, and ran  out.    \"Do you hear?\" cried the bluff man again.  \"Come along!\"    \"How can I, when he's sticking on like a rat?\" growled the man who held  Don.  \"Did you ever see such a young ruffian?\"    The bluff man took a stride or two forward, gripped Don by the shoulder,  and forced him from his hold.    \"Don't be a young fool,\" he said firmly, but not unkindly.  \"It's  plucky, but it's no good.  Can't you see we're seven to one?\"    \"I don't care if you're a hundred,\" raged Don, struggling hard, but  vainly.    \"Bravo, boy!  That's right; but we're English, and going to be your  messmates.  Wait till you get at the French; then you may talk like  that.\"    He caught Don by the hips, and with a dexterous Cornish wrestling trick,  raised him from the ground, and then threw him lightly beside Jem.    \"You'll do,\" he said.  \"I thought we'd let you go, because you're such a  boy, but you've got the pluck of a man, and you'll soon grow.\"    He stepped quickly to the entrance, and Don struggled to his feet, and  dashed at him again, but only flung himself against the door, which was  banged in his face, and locked.    \"The cowards!\" panted Don, as he stood there in the darkness.  \"Why,  Jem!\"    \"Yes, Mas' Don.\"    \"They won't let us go.\"    \"No, Mas' Don, that they won't.\"    \"I never thought the press-gang would dare to do such a thing as this.\"    \"I did, sir.  They'd press the monkeys out of a wild beast show if they  got the chance.\"    \"But what are we to do?\"    \"I d'know, sir.\"    \"We must let my uncle know at once.\"    \"Yes, sir, I would,\" said Jem grimly; \"I'd holloa.\"    \"Don't be stupid.  What's the good?\"    \"Not a bit, sir.\"    \"But my uncle--my mother, what will they think?\"    \"I'll"]]]
