The emperor, after a while, was obliged to make peace  with them, for his Spanish subjects were disgusted with the war, his  funds were exhausted, his forces dispersed, and his territories  threatened by the French. On the 2d of August, 1552, was concluded the  peace of Passau, which secured the return of the landgrave to his  dominions, the freedom of religion to the Protestants, and the  preservation of the German constitution. The sanguine hopes of the  emperor were dispelled, and all his ambitious schemes defeated, and he  left to meditate, in the intervals of the pains which he suffered from  the gout, on the instability of all greatness, and the vanity of human  life. Maurice was now extolled as extravagantly as he had been before  denounced, and his treachery justified, even by grave divines. But  what is most singular in the whole affair, was, that the French king,  while persecuting Protestants at home, should protect them abroad. But  this conduct may confirm, in a signal manner, the great truth of  history, that God regulates the caprice of human passions, and makes  them subservient to the accomplishment of his own purposes.    [Sidenote: Treaty of Passau.]    The labors and perplexities of Charles V. were not diminished by the  treaty of Passau. He continued his hostilities against the French and  against the Turks. He was obliged to raise the siege of Metz, which  was gallantly defended by the Duke of Guise. To his calamities in  France, were added others in Italy. Sienna revolted against his  government, and Naples was threatened by the Turks. The imperialists  were unsuccessful in Italy and in Hungary, and the Archduke Ferdinand  was obliged to abandon Transylvania. But war was carried on in the Low  Countries with considerable vigor.    Charles, whose only passion was the aggrandizement of his house, now  projected a marriage of his son, Philip, with Mary, queen of England.  The queen, dazzled by the prospect of marrying the heir of the  greatest monarch in Europe, and eager to secure his powerful aid to  reestablish Catholicism in England, listened to his proposal, although  it was disliked by the nation. In spite of the remonstrance of the  house of commons, the marriage treaty was concluded, and the marriage  celebrated, (1554.)    [Sidenote: Character of Charles V.]    Soon after, Charles formed the extraordinary resolution of resigning  his dominions to his son, and of retiring to a quiet retreat.  Diocletian is the only instance of a prince, capable of holding the  reins of government, who had adopted a similar course. All Europe was  astonished at the resolution of Charles, and all historians of the  period have moralized on the event. But it ceases to be mysterious,  when we remember that Charles was no nearer the accomplishment of the  ends which animated his existence, than he was thirty years before;  that he was disgusted and wearied with the world; that he suffered  severely from the gout, which, at times, incapacitated him for the  government of his extensive dominions. It was never his habit to  intrust others with duties and labors which he could perform himself,  and he felt that his empire needed a more powerful protector than his  infirmities permitted him to be. He was grown prematurely old, he felt  his declining health; longed for repose, and sought religious  consolation. Of all his vast possessions, he only reserved an annual  pension of one hundred thousand crowns; resigning Spain and the Low  Countries into the hands of Philip, and the empire of Germany to his  brother Ferdinand, who had already been elected as King of the Romans.  He then set out for his retreat in Spain, which was the monastery of  St. Justus, near Placentia, situated in a lovely vale, surrounded with  lofty trees, watered by a small brook, and rendered attractive by the  fertility of the soil, and the delightful temperature of the climate.  Here he spent his last days in agricultural improvements and religious  exercises, apparently regardless of that noisy world which he had  deserted forever, and indifferent to those political storms which his  restless ambition had raised. Here his grandeur and his worldly hopes  were buried in preparing himself for the future world. He lived with  great simplicity, for two years after his retreat, and died (1558,)  from the effects of the gout, which, added to his great labors, had  shattered his constitution. He was not what the world would call a  great genius, like Napoleon; but he was a man of great sagacity,  untiring industry, and respectable attainments. He was cautious, cold,  and selfish; had but little faith in human virtue, and was a slave, in  his latter days, to superstition. He was neither affable nor  courteous, but was sincere in his attachments, and munificent in  rewarding his generals and friends. He was not envious nor cruel, but  inordinately ambitious, and intent on aggrandizing his family. This  was his characteristic defect, and this, in a man so prominent and so  favored by circumstances, was enough to keep Europe in a turmoil for  nearly half a century.           *       *       *       *       *         REFERENCES.--Robertson's History of Charles V.

HENRY VIII.      The history of Europe in the sixteenth century is peculiarly the  history of the wars of kings, and of their efforts to establish  themselves and their families on absolute thrones. The monotonous, and  almost exclusive, record of royal pleasures and pursuits shows in how  little consideration the people were held. They struggled, and toiled,  and murmured as they do now. They probably had the same joys and  sorrows as in our times. But, in these times, they have considerable  influence on the government, the religion, the literature, and the  social life of nations. In the sixteenth century, this influence was  not so apparent; but power of all kinds seemed to emanate from kings  and nobles; at least from wealthy and cultivated classes. When this is  the case, when kings give a law to society, history is not  unphilosophical which recognizes chiefly their enterprises and ideas.    [Sidenote: Rise of Absolute Monarchy.]    The rise of absolute monarchy on the ruins of feudal states is one of  the chief features of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was  every where a strong tendency to centralization. Provinces, before  independent, were controlled by a central government. Standing armies  took the place of feudal armies. Kings took away from nobles the right  to coin money, administer justice, and impose taxes. The power of the  crown became supreme and unlimited.    But some monarchs were more independent than others, in proportion as  the power of nobles was suppressed, or, as the cities sided with the  central government, or, as provinces were connected and bound  together. The power of Charles V. was somewhat limited, in Spain, by  the free spirit of the Cortes, and, in Germany, by the independence of  the princes of the empire. But, in France and England, the king was  more absolute, although he did not rule over so great extent of  territory as did the emperor of Germany; and this is one reason why  Francis I. proved so strong an antagonist to his more powerful rival.    The history of France, during the reign of this monarch, is also the  history of Charles V., since they were both engaged in the same wars;  which wars have already been alluded to. Both of these monarchs failed  in the objects of their existence. If Charles did not realize his  dream of universal empire, neither did Francis leave his kingdom, at  his death, in a more prosperous state than he found it.    Francis I. was succeeded by his son Henry II., a warlike prince, but  destitute of prudence, and under the control of women. His policy,  however, was substantially that of his father, and he continued  hostilities against the emperor of Germany, till his resignation. He  was a bitter persecutor of the Protestants, and the seeds of  subsequent civil wars were sown by his zeal. He was removed from his  throne prematurely, being killed at a tournament, in 1559, soon after  the death of Charles V. Tournaments ceased with his death.    [Sidenote: Henry VIII.]    The reign of Henry VIII., the other great contemporary of Charles V.,  merits a larger notice, not only because his reign was the  commencement of a new era in England, but, also, because the affairs,  which engaged his attention, are not much connected with continental  history.    He ascended the throne in the year 1509, in his eighteenth year,  without opposition, and amid the universal joy of the nation; for his  manners were easy and frank, his disposition was cheerful, and his  person was handsome. He had made respectable literary attainments, and  he gave promise of considerable abilities. He was married, soon after  his accession, to Catharine, daughter of the King of Spain, and the  first years of his reign were happy, both to himself and to his  subjects. He had a well-filled treasury, which his father had amassed  with great care, a devoted people and an obedient parliament. All  circumstances seemed to conspire to strengthen his power, and to make  him the arbiter of Europe.    But this state did not last long. The young king was resolved to make  war on France, but was diverted from his aim by troubles in Scotland,  growing out of his own rapacity--a trait which ever peculiarly  distinguished him. These troubles resulted in a war with the Scots,  who were defeated at the memorable battle of Flodden Field, which Sir  Walter Scott, in his Marmion, has immortalized."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#13)"],[1,"  children, and all things were prepared for her visit. When the child--a  fine, bouncing babe--was born, its mother gave the midwife some  ointment, with directions to \"strike the child's eyes with it.\" Now the  word _strike_ in the Devonshire dialect means not to give a blow, but to  rub, or touch, gently; and as the woman obeyed she thought the task an  odd one, and in her curiosity tried the effect of the ointment upon one  of her own eyes. At once a change was wrought in the appearance of  everything around her. The new mother appeared no longer as a homely  cottager, but a beautiful lady attired in white; the babe, fairer than  before, but still witnessing with the elvish cast of its eye to its  paternity, was wrapped in swaddling clothes of silvery gauze; while the  elder children, who sat on either side of the bed, were transformed into  flat-nosed imps, who with mops and mows were busied to no end in  scratching their own polls, or in pulling the fairy lady's ears with  their long and hairy paws. The nurse, discreetly silent about what she  had done and the wonderful metamorphoses she beheld around her, got away  from the house of enchantment as quickly as she could; and the  sour-looking old fellow who had brought her carried her back on his  steed much faster than they had come. But the next market-day, when she  sallied forth to sell her eggs, whom should she see but the same  ill-looking scoundrel busied in pilfering sundry articles from stall to  stall. So she went up to him, and with a nonchalant air addressed him,  inquiring after his wife and child, who, she hoped, were both as well as  could be expected. \"What!\" exclaimed the old pixy thief, \"do you _see_  me to-day?\" \"See you! to be sure I do, as plain as I see the sun in the  skies; and I see you are busy into the bargain,\" she replied. \"Do you  so?\" cried he; \"pray, with which eye do you see all this?\" \"With the  right eye, to be sure.\" \"The ointment! the ointment!\" exclaimed the old  fellow; \"take that for meddling with what did not belong to you: you  shall see me no more.\" He struck her eye as he spoke, and from that  hour till the day of her death she was blind on the right side, thus  dearly paying for having gratified an idle curiosity in the house of a  pixy.[33]    In this tale the midwife acquired her supernatural vision through  gratifying her curiosity; but perhaps in the larger number of instances  it is acquired by accident. Her eye smarts or itches; and without  thinking, she rubs it with a finger covered with the Magical Ointment.  In a Breton variant, however, a certain stone, perfectly polished, and  in the form of an egg, is given to the woman to rub the fairy child's  eyes. In order to test its virtue she applies it to her own right eye,  thus obtaining the faculty of seeing the elves when they rendered  themselves invisible to ordinary sight. Sometimes, moreover, the  eye-salve is expressly given for the purpose of being used by the nurse  upon her own eyes. This was the case with a doctor who, in a north  country tale, was presented with one kind of ointment before he entered  the fairy realm and another when he left it. The former gave him to  behold a splendid portico in the side of a steep hill, through which he  passed into the fairies' hall within; but on anointing one eye with the  latter ointment, to that eye the hill seemed restored to its natural  shape. Similarly in Nithsdale a fairy rewards the kindness of a young  mother, to whom she had committed her babe to suckle, by taking her on a  visit to Fairyland. A door opened in a green hillside, disclosing a  porch which the nurse and her conductor entered. There the lady dropped  three drops of a precious dew on the nurse's left eyelid, and they were  admitted to a beautiful land watered with meandering rivulets and yellow  with corn, where the trees were laden with fruits which dropped honey.  The nurse was here presented with magical gifts, and when a green dew  had baptized her right eye she was enabled to behold further wonders.  On returning, the fairy passed her hand over the woman's eye and  restored its normal powers; but the woman had sufficient address to  secure the wonder-working balm. By its means she retained for many years  the gift of discerning the earth-visiting spirits; but on one occasion,  happening to meet the fairy lady who had given her the child, she  attempted to shake hands with her. \"What ee d' ye see me wi'?\" whispered  she. \"Wi' them baith,\" answered the matron. The fairy accordingly  breathed on her eyes; and even the power of the box failed afterwards to  restore their enchanted vision. A Carnarvonshire story, probably  incomplete, makes no mention of the ointment conferring supernatural  sight; but when the midwife is to be dismissed she is told to rub her  eyes with a certain salve, whereupon she at once finds herself sitting  on a tuft of rushes, and not in a palace: baby and all had disappeared.  The sequel, however, shows that by some means she had retained the power  of seeing fairies, at least with one eye; for when she next went to the  town, lo and behold! busily buying was the elf whose wife she had  attended. He betrayed the usual annoyance at being noticed by the woman;  and on learning with which eye she saw him he vanished, never more to be  looked upon by her. A tale from Guernsey attributes the magical faculty  to some of the child's saliva which fell into the nurse's eye. And a  still more extraordinary cause is assigned to it in a tradition from  Lower Brittany, where it is said to be due to the sacred bond formed  between the woman and a masculine elf when she became godmother and he  godfather to the babe.[34]    The effect of the wonder-working salve or water is differently described  in different tales. The fairy maiden Rockflower speaks of it to her  lover, in a Breton tale from Saint Cast, as \"clearing his eyes like her  own.\" And this is evidently to be understood in all cases. Accordingly,  we find the invariable result is that the favoured mortal beholds swarms  of fairies who were invisible before. But their dwellings, their  clothing, and their surroundings in general suffer a transformation by  no means always the same. A hovel or a cavern becomes a palace, whose  inhabitants, however ugly they may be, are attired like princesses and  courtiers, and are served with vessels of silver and gold. On the other  hand a castle is changed by the magical balm into \"a big rough cave,  with water oozing over the edges of the stones, and through the clay;  and the lady, and the lord, and the child, weazened, poverty-bitten  crathurs--nothing but skin and bone, and the rich dresses were old  rags.\" This is an Irish picture; but in the north of England it is much  the same. Instead of a neat cottage the midwife perceives the large  overhanging branches of an ancient oak, whose hollow and moss-grown  trunk she had before mistaken for the fireplace, where glow-worms  supplied the place of lamps. And in North Wales, when Mrs. Gamp  incautiously rubbed an itching eye with the finger she had used to rub  the baby's eyes, \"then she saw with that eye that the wife lay on a  bundle of rushes and withered ferns, in a large cave of big stones all  round her, with a little fire in one corner of it; and she also saw that  the lady was only Eilian, her former servant-girl, whilst with the other  eye she beheld the finest place she had ever seen.\" More terrible still,  in another story, evidently influenced by the Welsh Methodist revival,  the unhappy woman beheld \"herself surrounded by fearful flames; the  ladies and gentlemen looked like devils, and the children appeared like  the most hideous imps of hell, though with the other parts of her eyes  all looked grand and beautiful as before.\"[35]    However disturbing these visions may have been, the nurse was generally  discreet enough to maintain perfect silence upon them until she got back  to the safety of her own home. But it is not very surprising if her  tongue sometimes got the better of her, as in a story obtained by  Professor Rhys at Ystrad Meurig. There the heroine said to the elf-lady  in the evening, as she was dressing the infant: \"You have had a great  many visitors to-day.\" To this the lady sharply replied: \"How do you  know that? Have you been putting the ointment to your eyes?\" Thereupon  she jumped out of bed, and blew into her eyes, saying: \"Now you will see  no more.\" The woman could never afterwards see the fairies, nor was the  ointment entrusted to her again. So in the Cornish tale of Cherry of  Zennor, that young damsel, being hired by a fairy widower to keep house  for him, has the assurance to fall in love with him. She touches her own  eyes with the unguent kept for anointing the eyes of her master's little  boy, and in consequence catches her master kissing a lovely lady. When  he next attempts to kiss Cherry herself she slaps his face, and, mad  with jealousy, lets slip the secret. No fairy widower with any  self-respect could put up with such conduct as this; and Cherry has to  quit Fairyland. Her parents had supposed her dead; and when she returned  they believed at first it was her ghost. Indeed, it is said she was  never afterwards right in her head; and on moonlight nights, until she  died, she would wander on to the Lady Downs to look for her master.[36]    The earliest writer who mentions a story of this type is Gervase of  Tilbury, marshal of the kingdom of Arles, who wrote about the beginning  of the thirteenth century. He professes to have himself met with a woman  of Arles who was one day washing clothes on the banks of the Rhone, when  a wooden bowl floated by her. In trying to catch it, she got out of her  depth and was seized by a Drac. The Dracs were beings who haunted the  waters of rivers and dwelt in the deep pools, appearing often on the  banks and in the towns in human form. The woman in question was carried  down beneath the"]]]
