We will drop music and continue our illustration by reference to English  poetry.  In trochaic meter we have an accented syllable followed by an  unaccented, and in dactylic we have an accented syllable followed by two  unaccented syllables, as for instance in the following:    Trochaic---       \"In' his cham'ber, weak' and dy'ing,       Was' the Nor'man bar'on ly'ing.\"    Dactylic--       \"This' is the for'est prime'val.       The mur'muring pines' and the hem'locks . . .       Stand' like Dru'ids of eld'.\"    Or in the iambic we have an unaccented syllable followed by an accented,  as in--         \"It was' the schoo'ner Hes'perus'       That sai'led the win'try sea'.\"    But if two syllables are so short that they can be uttered in the same  time as one, two syllables will satisfy the meter just as well as one.  Thus we have the following, in the same general met{r}e r as the  foregoing quotation:       \"I stood' on the bridge' at mid'night,       As the clocks' were stri'king the hour'.\"    It is all a matter of time.  If we were to place a syllable that  required a long time for utterance in a place where only a short time  could be given to it, we should seriously break the rhythmic flow;  and all the pauses indicated by punctuation marks are taken into  account, in the same way that rests are counted in music.  The natural  pause at the end of a line of poetry often occupies the time of an  entire syllable, and we have a rational explanation of what has been  called without explanation \"catalectic\" and \"acatalectic\" lines.    The same principles govern the accenting of single words in a very large  degree, and must be taken into account in reading prose aloud.    The general tendency of the English language is to throw the accent  toward the beginning of a word, just as in French the tendency is to  throw it toward the end.  Words of two and three syllables are regularly  accented on the first syllable; but if the second syllable is stronger  than the first, it will get the accent.  Thus we have _sum'mer, ar'gue,  pres'ent,_ etc.; but _agree', resolve', retain',_ etc.*  We have  indicated above a natural reason why it cannot fail in the cases  mentioned.  The voice would be incapable of accenting easily the  unimportant prefix in such a word as _ac-cuse',_ for instance.    Sometimes the strength of both syllables in words of two syllables is  equal, and then the accent may be placed on either at will, as in the  case of _re'tail,_ and _retail', pro'ceed_ and _proceed',_ etc.  There are about sixty of these words capable of being differently  accented according to meaning.  The verb usually takes the accent on the  last syllable.  In words in which it seems desirable on account of the  meaning to accent the first syllable when the second syllable is  naturally stronger, that second syllable is deliberately shortened in  the pronunciation, as in _moun'tain, cur'tain,_ etc., in which the last  syllable has the value of _tin_.     *In the chapter at the beginning of Webster's dictionary devoted to  accent it is stated that these words are accented on the last syllable  because by derivation the root rather than the prefix receives the  accent.  This \"great principle of derivation\" often fails, it is  admitted.  We have indicated above a natural reason why it cannot  fail in the cases mentioned.  The voice would be incapable of accenting  easily the unimportant prefix in such a word as _ac-cuse',_ for instance.    In words of three syllables, the accent is usually on the first syllable,  especially if the second syllable is weak and the last syllable no weaker  if not indeed stronger.  Thus we have _pe'-ri-od, per'-son-ate, It'-aly,_  etc.    If for any reason the second syllable becomes stronger than either the  first or the last, then the second syllable must receive the accent  and the syllable before it is usually strengthened.  Thus we have  _i-tal'-ic,_ and there is a natural tendency to make the _i_ long,  though in _Italy_ it is short.  This is because _tal_ is stronger than  _ic,_ though not stronger than _y_.  The syllable _ic_ is very weak, but  the obscure _er,_ or, _ur_ is still weaker, and so we have _rhet'-or-ic_.  In _his-tor'-ic_ the first syllable is too weak to take an accent, and we  strengthen its second syllable, giving _o_ the _aw_ sound.    It will be seen that in words of two or more syllables there may be a  second, and even a third accent, the voice dwelling on every other  syllable.  In _pe'-ri-od_ the dwelling on _od_ is scarcely perceptible,  but in _pe'-ri-od'-ic_ it becomes the chief accent, and it receives this  special force because _ic_ is so weak, In _ter'-ri-to-ry_ the secondary  accent on _to_ is slight because _ri_ is nearly equal and it is easy to  spread the stress over both syllables equally.    The principles above illustrated have a decided limitation in the fact  that the value of vowels in English is more or less variable, and the  great \"principle of derivation,\" as Webster calls it, exercises a still  potent influence, though one becoming every year less binding.  The following words taken bodily from the Greek or Latin are accented  on the penult rather than the antepenult (as analogy would lead us to  accent them) because in the original language the penultimate vowel was  long: abdo'men, hori'zon, deco'rum, diplo'ma, muse'um, sono'rous,  acu'men, bitu'men; and similarly such words as farra'go, etc.  We may never be sure just how to accent a large class of names taken  from the Latin and Greek without knowing the length of the vowel in the  original,--such words, for example, as _Mede'a, Posi'don_ (more properly  written _Posei'don_), _Came'nia, Iphigeni'a, Casto'lus, Cas'tores, etc_.    In a general way we may assume that the chief accent lies on  either the penult or antepenult, the second syllable from the end,  or the third, and we will naturally place it upon the one that appears  to us most likely to be strong, while a slight secondary accent goes on  every second syllable before or after.  If the next to the last syllable  is followed by a double consonant, we are sure it must be accented,  and if the combination of consonants is such that we cannot easily  accent the preceding syllable we need entertain no reasonable doubt.  By constant observation we will soon learn the usual value of vowels  and syllables as we pronounce them in ordinary speaking, and will follow  the analogy.  If we have difficulty in determining the chief accent,  we will naturally look to see where secondary accents may come,  and thus get the key to the accent.    It will be seen that rules are of little value, in this as in other  departments of the study of language.  The main thing is to form the  _habit of observing_ words as we read and pronounce them, and thus develop  a habit and a sense that will guide us.  The important thing to start with  is that we should know the general principle on which accent is based.    Special Rules for Accent.    Words having the following terminations are usually accented on the  antepenult, or third syllable from the end: _cracy, ferous, fluent, flous,  honal, gony, grapher, graphy, loger, logist, logy, loquy, machy, mathy,  meter, metry, nomy, nomy, parous, pathy, phony, scopy, strophe, tomy,  trophy, vomous, vorous_.    Words of more than two syllables ending in _cate, date, gate, fy, tude,_  and _ty_ preceded by a vowel usually accent the antepenult,  as _dep'recate,_ etc.    All words ending in a syllable beginning with an _sh_ or _zh_ sound,  or _y_ consonant sound, except those words ending in _ch_ sounded like  _sh_ as _capu-chin',_ accent the penult or next to the last syllable,  as _dona'tion, condi'tion,_ etc.    Words ending in _ic_ usually accent the penult, _scientif'ic, histor'ic,_  etc.  The chief exceptions are _Ar'abic, arith'metic, ar'senic, cath'olic,  chol'eric, her'etic, lu'natic, pleth'oric, pol'itic, rhet'oric, tur'meric.  Climacteric_ is accented by some speakers on one syllable and by some on  the other; so are _splenetic_ and _schismatic_.    Most words ending in _eal_ accent the antepenult, but _ide'al_ and  _hymene'al_ are exceptions.  Words in _ean_ and _eum_ are divided,  some one way and some the other.    Words of two syllable ending in _ose_ usually accent the last syllable,  as _verbose',_ but words of three or more syllables with this ending  accent the antepenult, with a secondary accent on the last syllable,  as _com'-a-tose_.    When it is desired to distinguish words differing but by a syllable,  the syllable in which the difference lies is given a special accent,  as in _bi'en'nial_ and _tri'en'nial, em'inent_ and _im'minent, op'pose'_  and _sup'pose',_ etc.    Sounds of Vowels in Different Positions.    Let us now consider the value of vowels.    We note first that position at the end of a word naturally makes every  vowel long except _y_; (e. g., _Levi, Jehu, potato_); but _a_ has the  Italian sound at the end of a word, or the sound usually given to _ah_.    A vowel followed by two or more consonants is almost invariably short.  If a vowel is followed by one consonant in an accented syllable it will  probably receive the accent and be long.  If the word has two syllables,  as in _Kinah,_ but if the word has three syllables the consonant will  probably receive the accent and the vowel will be short, as in _Jo`n'adab_.    In words of three or more syllables the vowels are naturally short  unless made long by position or the like; but the vowel in the syllable  before the one which receives the accent, if it is the first syllable  of the word and followed by but one consonant, is likely to be long,  because the consonant which would otherwise end the syllable is drawn  over to the accented syllable, as in _di:-men'-sion_.  This rule is  still more in force if no consonant intervenes, as _i_ in _di:-am'-e-ter_.  If the vowel is followed by two consonants which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#13)"],[1,"low and the  sunrise is at hand, Opechancanough will come to you to bid you farewell.  He will give you the pearls he wears about his neck for a present to the  governor and a bracelet for yourself. Also he will give you three men  for a guard through the forest. He has messages of love to send the  white men, and he would send them by you who were his enemy and his  captive. So all the white men shall believe in his love.\"    \"Well!\" I said drily as he paused. \"I will bear the messages. What  next?\"    \"Your guards will take you slowly through the forest, stopping to eat  and sleep. For them there is no need to run like the stag with the  hunter behind it.\"    \"Then we should make for Jamestown as for life,\" I said, \"not sleeping  or eating or making pause?\"    \"Yes,\" he replied, \"if you would not die, you and all your people.\"    In the silence of the hut the fire crackled, and the branches of the  trees outside, bent by the wind, made a grating sound against the bark  roof.    \"How die?\" I asked at last. \"Speak out!\"    \"Die by the arrow and the tomahawk,\" he answered,--\"yea, and by the guns  you have given the red men. To-morrow's sun, and the next, and the  next--three suns--and the tribes will fall upon the English. At the same  hour, when the men are in the fields and the women and children are in  the houses, they will strike--all the tribes, as one man; and from where  the Powhatan falls over the rocks to the salt water beyond Accomac,  there will not be one white man left alive.\"    He ceased to speak, and for a minute the fire made the only sound in the  hut. Then I asked, \"All die? There are three thousand Englishmen in  Virginia.\"    \"They are scattered and unwarned. The fighting men of the villages of  the Powhatan and the Pamunkey and the great bay are many, and they have  sharpened their hatchets and filled their quivers with arrows.\"    \"Scattered!\" I cried. \"Strewn broadcast up and down the river--here a  lonely house, there a cluster of two or three--the men in the fields or  at the wharves, the women and children busy within doors, all unwarned!\"    I leaned against the side of the hut, for my heart beat like a  frightened woman's. \"Three days!\" I exclaimed. \"If we go with all our  speed, we shall be in time. When did you learn this thing?\"    \"While you watched the dance,\" the Indian answered, \"Opechancanough and  I sat within his lodge in the darkness. His heart was moved, and he  talked to me of his own youth in a strange country, south of the sunset.  Also he spoke to me of Powhatan, my father--of how wise he was and how  great a chief before the English came, and how he hated them. And  then--then I heard what I have told you!\"    \"How long has this been planned?\"    \"For many moons. I have been a child, fooled and turned aside from the  trail; not wise enough to see it beneath the flowers, through the smoke  of the peace pipes.\"    \"Why does Opechancanough send us back to the settlements?\" I demanded.    \"It is his fancy. Every hunter and trader and learner of our tongues,  living in the villages or straying in the woods, has been sent back to  Jamestown or his home with presents and fair words. You will lull the  English in Jamestown into a faith in the smiling sky just before the  storm bursts on them in fullest fury.\"    There was a pause.    \"Nantaquas,\" I said, \"you are not the first child of Powhatan who has  loved and shielded the white men.\"    \"Pocahontas was a woman, a child,\" he answered. \"Out of pity she saved  your lives, not knowing that it was to the hurt of her people. Then you  were few and weak and could not take your revenge. Now, if you die not,  you will drink deep of vengeance--so deep that your lips may never leave  the cup. More ships will come, and more; you will grow ever stronger.  There may come a moon when the deep forests and the shining rivers will  know us, to whom [v]Kiwassa gave them, no more.\"    \"You will be with your people in the war?\" I asked.    \"I am an Indian,\" was his simple reply.    \"Come against us if you will,\" I returned. \"Nobly warned, fair upon our  guard, we will meet you as knightly foe should be met.\"    Very slowly he raised his arm from his side and held out his hand. His  eyes met mine in somber inquiry, half eager, half proudly doubtful. I  went to him at once and took his hand in mine. No word was spoken.  Presently he withdrew his hand from my clasp, and, putting his finger to  his lips, whistled low to the Indian girl. She drew aside the mats, and  we passed out, Diccon and I, leaving him standing as we had found him,  upright against the post, in the red firelight.    Should we ever go through the woods, pass through that gathering storm,  reach Jamestown, warn them there of the death that was rushing upon  them? Should we ever leave that hated village? Would the morning ever  come? It was an alarm that was sounding, and there were only two to  hear; miles away beneath the mute stars English men and women lay  asleep, with the hour thundering at their gates, and there was none to  cry, \"Awake!\" I could have cried out in that agony of waiting, with the  leagues on leagues to be traveled and the time so short! I saw, in my  mind's eye, the dark warriors gathering, tribe on tribe, war party on  war party, thick crowding shadows of death, slipping through the silent  forest ... and in the clearings the women and children!    It came to an end, as all things earthly will. When the ruffled pools  amid the marshes were rosy red beneath the sunrise, the women brought us  food, and the warriors and old men gathered about us. I offered them  bread and meat and told them that they must come to Jamestown to taste  the white man's cookery.    Scarcely was the meal over when Opechancanough issued from his lodge,  and, coming slowly up to us, took his seat upon the white mat that was  spread for him. Through his scalp lock was stuck an eagle's feather;  across his face, from temple to chin, was a bar of red paint; the eyes  above were very bright and watchful.    One of his young men brought a great pipe, carved and painted, stem and  bowl; it was filled with tobacco, lit, and borne to the emperor. He put  it to his lips and smoked in silence, while the sun climbed higher and  higher and the golden minutes that were more precious than heart's blood  went by swiftly.    At last, his part in the solemn mockery played, he held out the pipe to  me.    \"The sky will fall, and the rivers will run dry, and the birds cease to  sing,\" he said, \"before the smoke of this peace-pipe fades from the  land.\"    I took the symbol of peace and smoked it as silently and soberly as he  had done before me, then laid it leisurely aside and held out my hand.    \"Come to Jamestown,\" I said, \"to smoke of the Englishman's pipe and  receive rich presents--a red robe like your brother Powhatan, and a cup  from which you shall drink, you and all your people.\"    But the cup I meant was that of punishment.    The savage laid his dark fingers in mine for an instant, withdrew them,  and, rising to his feet, motioned to three Indians who stood out from  the throng of warriors.    \"These are Captain Percy's guides and friends,\" he announced. \"The sun  is high; it is time that he was gone. Here are presents for him and my  brother the governor.\" As he spoke, he took from his neck the rope of  pearls and from his arm a copper bracelet, and laid both upon my palm.    \"Thank you, Opechancanough,\" I said briefly. \"When we meet again I will  not greet you with empty thanks.\"    We bade farewell to the noisy throng and went down to the river, where  we found a canoe and rowers, crossed the stream, and entered the forest,  which stretched black and forbidding before us--the blacker that we now  knew the dreadful secret it guarded.      II         After leaving the Indian village, Captain Percy and Diccon found       that their guides purposely delayed the march, so that they would       not reach Jamestown until just before the beginning of the attack,       when it would be too late for them to warn the English, if they       suspected anything. Percy and Diccon, in this dilemma, surprised       the Indian guides and killed them, then hurried on with all       possible speed toward Jamestown. As they hastened through the       forest, Diccon was shot by an Indian and mortally wounded; Captain       Percy remained with him until his death, and again took up the       journey, now alone and greatly fearing that he would arrive too       late.    The dusk had quite fallen when I reached the neck of land. Arriving at  the palisade that protected Jamestown, I beat upon the gate and called  to the warden to open. He did so with starting eyes. Giving him a few  words and cautioning him to raise no alarm in the town, I hurried by him  into the street and down it toward the house that was set aside for the  governor of Virginia, Sir Francis Wyatt.    The governor's door was open, and in the hall servingmen were moving to  and fro. When I came in upon them, they cried out as if it had been a  ghost, and one fellow let a silver dish fall to the floor with a  clatter. They shook with fright and stood back as I passed them without  a word and went on to the governor's great room. The door was ajar, and  I pushed it open and stood for a minute on the threshold. They were all  there--the principal men of the colony, the governor, the [v]treasurer,  [v]West, [v]John Rolfe.    At sight of me the governor sprang to his feet; through the treasurer's  lips came a long, sighing breath; West's dark face was ashen. I came  forward to the table, and leaned my weight upon it; for all the waves of  the sea were roaring in my ears and the lights were going up and down.    \"Are you man or spirit!\" cried Rolfe through white lips. \"Are you Ralph  Percy?\"    \"Yes,\" I said, \"I am Percy.\"    With an effort I drew myself erect, and standing so, told my tidings,  quietly and with circumstance, so as to"]]]
