When breakfast was over, appearances became much more  hopeful, and before noon the storm had ceased to rage.    Taking advantage of the change, without delay they loaded the  pack-mules, saddled, mounted, and set forth.    To many travellers it would have been death to have ventured out on such  a trackless waste, but Pedro knew the road and the landmarks so  thoroughly that he advanced with his wonted confidence.  At first the  snow was very deep, and, despite their utmost care, they once or twice  strayed from the road, and were not far from destruction.  As they  descended, however, the intense cold abated; and when they came out upon  occasional table-lands, they found that the snow-fall there had been  much less than in the higher regions, also that it had drifted off the  road so much that travelling became more easy.    That night they came to a second hut-of-refuge, and next day had  descended into a distinctly warmer region on the eastern slopes of the  great range, over which they travelled from day to day with ever  increasing comfort.  Sometimes they put up at outlying mountain farms,  and were always hospitably received; sometimes at small hamlets or  villages, where they could exchange or purchase mules, and, not  unfrequently, they encamped on the wild mountain slopes, with the green  trees or an overhanging cliff, or the open sky to curtain them, and the  voices of the puma and the jaguar for their lullaby.    Strange to say, in crossing the higher parts of the Andes not one of the  party suffered from the rarity of the air.  Many travellers experience  sickness, giddiness, and extreme exhaustion from this cause in those  regions.  Some have even died of the effects experienced at the greater  heights, yet neither Manuela, nor Lawrence, nor Quashy was affected in  the slightest degree.  We can assign no reason for their exemption--can  only state the fact.  As for the guide, he was in this matter--as,  indeed, he seemed to be in everything--invulnerable.    One afternoon, as they rode along a mountain track enjoying the  sunshine, which at that hour was not too warm, Lawrence pushed up  alongside of the guide.    \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that we are wandering wonderfully far out of  our way just now.  We have been going due north for several days; at  least so my pocket compass tells me, and if my geography is not greatly  at fault, our backs instead of our faces are turned at present towards  Buenos Ayres.  I do not wish to pry into your secrets, Senhor Pedro, but  if it is not presuming too much I should like to know when we shall  begin to move in the direction of our journey's end.\"    \"There is neither presumption nor impropriety in your wish,\" returned  the guide.  \"I told you at starting that we should pursue a devious  route, for reasons which are immaterial to you, but there is no reason  why I should not explain that at present I am diverging for only a few  miles from our track to visit a locality--a cottage--which is sacred to  me.  After that we will turn eastward until we reach the head-waters of  streams that will conduct us towards our journey's end.\"    With this explanation he was obliged to rest content, for Pedro spoke  like one who did not care to be questioned.  Indeed there was an  unusually absent air about him, seeing which Lawrence drew rein and fell  back until he found himself alongside of Quashy.    Always ready--nay, eager--for sympathetic discourse, the negro received  his young master with a bland, expansive, we might almost say effusive,  smile.    \"Well, massa, how's you gittin' along now?\"    \"Pretty well, Quashy.  How do you?\"    \"Oh! fuss-rate, massa--only consid'rable obercome wid surprise.\"    \"What surprises you?\"    \"De way we's agwine, to be sure.  Look dar.\"  He pointed towards the  towering mountain peaks and wild precipices that closed in the narrow  glen or gorge up which they were slowly proceeding.    \"In all our trabels we's nebber come to a place like dat.  It looks like  de fag end ob creation.  You couldn't git ober de mountain-tops 'cept  you had wings, an' you couldn't climb ober de pres'pisses 'cep you was a  monkey or a skirl--though it _am_ bery lubly, no doubt.\"    The negro's comments were strictly correct, though somewhat uncouthly  expressed.  The valley was apparently surrounded in all directions by  inaccessible precipices, and the white peaks of the Andes towered into  the skies at its head.  Within rugged setting lay a fine stretch of  undulating land, diversified by crag and hillock, lake and rivulet, with  clustering shrubs and trees clinging to the cliffs, and clothing the  mountain slopes in rich, and, in many places, soft luxuriance.  It was  one of those scenes of grandeur and loveliness in profound solitude  which tend to raise in the thoughtful mind the perplexing but not  irreverent question, \"Why did the good and bountiful Creator form such  places of surpassing beauty to remain for thousands of years almost, if  not quite, unknown to man?\"    For, as far as could be seen, no human habitation graced the  mountain-sides, no sign of cultivation appeared in the valley, though  myriads of the lower animals sported on and in the waters, among the  trees and on the ground.    Perchance man over-estimates his own importance--at least underrates  that of the animal kingdom below him--and is too apt to deem everything  in nature wasted that cannot be directly or indirectly connected with  himself!  Is all that glows in beauty in the wilderness doomed to \"blush  unseen\"?  Is all the sweetness expended on the desert air \"wasted?\"    As the guide rode slowly forward, he glanced from side to side with  thoughtful yet mournful looks, as if his mind were engaged in meditating  on some such insoluble problems.  As he neared the head of the valley,  however, he seemed to awake from a trance, suddenly put spurs to his  mule, and went off at a canter.  The rest of the party followed at some  distance behind, but at so slow a pace, compared with that of the guide,  that the latter was soon lost to sight among the trees.    Somewhat surprised at his unusual state of mind Lawrence pushed on and  soon reached an open glade which showed some signs of having been  cultivated.  At the end of it stood a pretty little cottage, in front of  which Pedro was standing motionless, with clasped hands and drooping  head.    Lawrence hesitated to disturb him, but as Quashy had no such  hesitations, and rode smartly forward, his companions followed.    Pedro turned with a grave look as they came up, and said--    \"My home.  I bid you welcome.\"    \"Your home!\" echoed Lawrence, in surprise.    \"Ay, a happy home it once was--but--desolate enough now.  Come, we will  sleep here to-night.  Unload the mules, Quashy, and kindle a fire.  Go  into the room on the right, Manuela.  You will find a couch and other  civilised comforts there.  Senhor Armstrong, will you come with me?\"    Without even awaiting a reply, the guide walked smartly into the bushes  in rear of his lonely dwelling, followed by our hero.  In a few minutes  they reached a mound or hillock, which had been cleared of trees and  underwood, and from the summit of which one could see over the tree-tops  and the cottage roof away down the valley to the horizon of the  table-lands beyond.  It was a lovely spot, and, as Lawrence saw it that  quiet sunny afternoon, was suggestive only of peace and happiness.    There was a rustic bower on the mound, in which a roughly-constructed  seat was fixed firmly to the ground.  In front of the bower was a grave  with a headstone, on which was carved the single word \"Mariquita.\"    Lawrence looked at his companion, but refrained from speech on observing  that he seemed to be struggling with strong emotion.  In a few seconds  Pedro, having mastered his feelings, turned and said, in a tone that  betrayed nothing save profound sadness--    \"The body of my wife lies there.  Her pure spirit, thank God, is with  its Maker.\"    Lawrence's power of sympathy was so great that he hesitated to reply,  fearing to hurt the feelings of one for whom, by that time, he had come  to entertain sincere regard.  He was about to speak, when Pedro raised  his head gently, as if to check him.    \"Sit beside me, senhor,\" he said, seating himself on the rustic seat  already referred to.  \"You have from our first meeting given me your  confidence so frankly and freely that the least I can do is to give you  mine in return--as far, at least, as that is possible.  You are the  first human being I have invited to sit _there_ since Mariquita left me.  Shall I tell you something of my history, Senhor Armstrong?\"    Of course Lawrence assented, with a look of deep interest.    \"Well, then,\" said Pedro, \"it may perhaps surprise you to learn that I  am an Irishman.\"    To this Lawrence replied, with a slight smile, that he was not very  greatly surprised, seeing that the perplexing character of that race was  such as to justify him in expecting almost anything of them.    \"I'm not sure whether to take that remark as complimentary or  otherwise,\" returned Pedro; \"however, the fighting tendency with which  my countrymen are credited has departed from me.  I won't quarrel with  you on the point.  At the age of sixteen I was sent to America to seek  my fortune.  My mother I never knew.  She died when I was a child.  My  father died the year after I left home.  How I came to drift here it  would be difficult, as well as tedious, to explain.

He goes home to Blunderton,  stirs up the people, hires the town-hall, gets the chief magistrate to  take the chair, and forms a _Branch_ of the Royal National Lifeboat  Institution--the Blunderton Branch, which, ever afterwards, honourably  bears its annual share in the expense, and in the privilege, of rescuing  men, women, and little ones from the raging seas.  Moreover, Brown  becomes the enthusiastic secretary of the Branch.  And here let me  remark that no society of this nature can hope to succeed, unless its  secretary be an enthusiast.    Now, reader, if you think I have made out a good case, let me entreat  you to go, with Brown in your eye, \"and do likewise.\"    And don't fancy that I am advising you to attempt the impossible.  The  supposed Blunderton case is founded on fact.  During a lecturing tour  one man--somewhat enthusiastic in the lifeboat cause--preached the  propriety of inland towns starting Branches of the Lifeboat Institution.  Upwards of half a dozen such towns responded to the exhortation, and,  from that date, have continued to be annual contributors and  sympathisers.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    THE LIFE-SAVING ROCKET.    We shall now turn from the lifeboat to our other great engine of war  with which we do battle with the sea from year to year, namely, the  Rocket Apparatus.    This engine, however, is in the hands of Government, and is managed by  the coastguard.  And it may be remarked here, in reference to coastguard  men, that they render constant and effective aid in the saving of  shipwrecked crews.  At least one-third of the medals awarded by the  Lifeboat Institution go to the men of the coastguard.    Every one has heard of Captain Manby's mortar.  Its object is to effect  communication between a stranded ship and the shore by means of a rope  attached to a shot, which is fired over the former.  The same end is now  more easily attained by a rocket with a light rope, or line, attached to  it.    Now the rocket apparatus is a little complicated, and ignorance in  regard to the manner of using it has been the cause of some loss of  life.  Many people think that if a rope can only be conveyed from a  stranded ship to the shore, the saving of the crew is comparatively a  sure and easy matter.  This is a mistake.  If a rope--a stout cable--  were fixed between a wreck and the shore, say at a distance of three or  four hundred yards, it is obvious that only a few of the strongest men  could clamber along it.  Even these, if benumbed and exhausted--as is  frequently the case in shipwreck--could not accomplish the feat.  But  let us suppose, still further, that the vessel rolls from side to side,  dipping the rope in the sea and jerking it out again at each roll, what  man could make the attempt with much hope of success, and what, in such  circumstances, would become of women and children?    More than one rope must be fixed between ship and shore, if the work of  saving life is to be done efficiently.  Accordingly, in the rocket  apparatus there are four distinct portions of tackle.  First the  _rocket-line_; second, the _whip_; third, the _hawser_; and, fourth, the  _lifebuoy_--sometimes called the sling-lifebuoy, and sometimes the  breeches-buoy.    The rocket-line is that which is first thrown over the wreck by the  rocket.  It is small and light, and of considerable length--the extreme  distance to which a rocket may carry it in the teeth of a gale being  between three and four hundred yards.    The whip is a thicker line, rove through a block or pulley, and having  its two ends spliced together without a knot, in such a manner that the  join does not check the running of the rope through the pulley.  Thus  the whip becomes a double line--a sort of continuous rope, or, as it is  called, an \"endless fall,\" by means of which the lifebuoy is passed to  and fro between the wreck and shore.    The hawser is a thick rope, or cable, to which the lifebuoy is suspended  when in action.    The lifebuoy is one of those circular lifebuoys--with which most of us  are familiar--which hang at the sides of steamers and other vessels, to  be ready in case of any one falling overboard.  It has, however, the  addition of a pair of huge canvas breeches attached to it, to prevent  those who are being rescued from slipping through.    Let us suppose, now, that a wreck is on the shore at a part where the  coast is rugged and steep, the beach very narrow, and the water so deep  that it has been driven on the rocks not more than a couple of hundred  yards from the cliffs.  The beach is so rocky that no lifeboat would  dare to approach, or, if she did venture, she would be speedily dashed  to pieces--for a lifeboat is not _absolutely_ invulnerable!  The  coastguardsmen are on the alert.  They had followed the vessel with  anxious looks for hours that day as she struggled right gallantly to  weather the headland and make the harbour.  When they saw her miss stays  on the last tack and drift shoreward, they knew her doom was fixed;  hurried off for the rocket-cart; ran it down to the narrow strip of  pebbly beach below the cliffs, and now they are fixing up the shore part  of the apparatus.  The chief part of this consists of the rocket-stand  and the box in which the line is coiled, in a peculiar and scarcely  describable manner, that permits of its flying out with great freedom.    While thus engaged they hear the crashing of the vessel's timbers as the  great waves hurl or grind her against the hungry rocks.  They also hear  the cries of agonised men and women rising even above the howling storm,  and hasten their operations.    At last all is ready.  The rocket, a large one made of iron, is placed  in its stand, a _stick_ and the _line_ are attached to it, a careful aim  is taken, and fire applied.  Amid a blaze and burst of smoke the rocket  leaps from its position, and rushes out to sea with a furious  persistency that even the storm-fiend himself is powerless to arrest.  But he can baffle it to some extent--sufficient allowance has not been  made for the force and direction of the wind.  The rocket flies, indeed,  beyond the wreck, but drops into the sea, a little to the left of her.    \"Another--look alive!\" is the sharp order.  Again the fiery messenger of  mercy leaps forth, and this time with success.  The line drops over the  wreck and catches in the rigging.  And at this point comes into play,  sometimes, that ignorance to which I have referred--culpable ignorance,  for surely every captain who sails upon the sea ought to have intimate  acquaintance with the details of the life-saving apparatus of every  nation.  Yet, so it is, that some crews, after receiving the  rocket-line, have not known what to do with it, and have even perished  with the means of deliverance in their grasp.  In one case several men  of a crew tied themselves together with the end of the line and leaped  into the sea!  They were indeed hauled ashore, but I believe that most,  if not all, of them were drowned.    Those whom we are now rescuing, however, are gifted, let us suppose,  with a small share of common sense.  Having got hold of the line, one of  the crew, separated from the rest, signals the fact to the shore by  waving a hat, handkerchief, or flag, if it be day.  At night a light is  shown over the ship's side for a short time, and then concealed.  This  being done, those on shore make the end of the line fast to the _whip_  with its \"tailed-block\" and signal to haul off the line.  When the whip  is got on board, a _tally_, or piece of wood, is seen with white letters  on a black ground painted on it.  On one side the words are English--on  the other French.  One of the crew reads eagerly:--    \"Make the tail of the block fast to the lower mast well up.  If masts  are gone, then to the best place you can find.  Cast off the  rocket-line; see that the rope in the block runs free, and show signal  to the shore.\"    Most important cautions these, for if the tail-block be fastened too low  on the wreck, the ropes will dip in the water, and perhaps foul the  rocks.  If the whip does not run free in the block it will jamb and the  work will be stopped; and, if the signals are not attended to, the  coastguardsmen may begin to act too soon, or, on the other hand, waste  precious time.    But the signals are rightly given; the other points attended to, and the  remainder of the work is done chiefly from the shore.  The men there,  attach the hawser to the whip, and by hauling one side thereof in, they  run the other side and the hawser out.  On receiving the hawser the crew  discover another _tally_ attached to it, and read:--    \"Make this hawser fast about two feet above the tail-block.  See all  clear, and that the rope in the block runs free, and show signal to the  shore.\"    The wrecked crew are quick as well as intelligent.  Life depends on it!  They fasten the end of the hawser, as directed, about two feet _above_  the place where the tail-block is fixed to the stump of the mast.  There  is much shouting and gratuitous advice, no doubt, from the forward and  the excited, but the captain and mate are cool.  They attend to duty and  pay no regard to any one.    Signal is again made to the shore, and the men of the coastguard at once  set up a triangle with a pendent block, through which the shore-end of  the hawser is rove, and attached to a double-block tackle.  Previously,  however, a block called a \"traveller\" has been run on to the hawser.  This block travels on and _above_ the hawser, and from it is suspended  the lifebuoy.  To the \"traveller\" block the whip is attached; then the  order is given to the men to haul, and away goes the lifebuoy to the  wreck, run out by the _men on shore_.    When it arrives at the wreck the order is, \"Women first.\"  But the women  are too terrified, it may be, to venture.  Can you wonder?  If you saw  the"]]]
