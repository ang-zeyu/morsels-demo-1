They had held it first on a lease, then on a second short lease, but  afterwards had merely rented it from year to year, not imagining that  any other tenant would covet it with all its pretty heavy  responsibilities. Dr Burton had, from his natural irritability,  sometimes said he would prefer to be elsewhere; but when it came to  finding some other place which would hold his books--some place not too  far to move them to--to the abandonment of his own carpentery, &c.,--he  lamented the departure as much as others. His one proviso as to the new  abode was, that it was not to be in the town, or nearer the town than  Craighouse.    The whole spring Dr Burton's family sought in all directions for a  suitable abode, and at last pitched on that left vacant by Mrs  Cunningham's death as most nearly combining all the various requisites.  On the 20th of May 1878 the flitting from Craighouse to Morton was  completed. Morton is fully two miles farther from Edinburgh than  Craighouse, the approach to it from the town being a continuous ascent  on to a shoulder of the Pentlands. Its situation is pretty and entirely  rural, but with nothing of the unrivalled beauty of that of Craighouse,  which commanded a view extending from North Berwick Law to Ben Lomond,  yet lay well sheltered among its lovely hills and splendid trees. The  great drawback of Morton House, for Dr Burton's family, lay in the  greater distance from the town. The time spent in travelling the up-hill  road was a serious loss, to say nothing of the fatigue. Dr Burton never  would allow this to be a disadvantage, so far as he was concerned, but  the writer is persuaded it was seriously prejudicial to his health.    During the summer of this year Dr Burton was invited to Oxford to  receive the honour of a D.C.L. degree. He went, and was highly delighted  with his visit. He had some years previously received a similar  compliment from the University of Edinburgh.    Dr Burton, by way of setting a good example to his family, who continued  to lament the loss of Craighouse, attached himself excessively to  Morton. He was farther attached to it by the recollection of having been  Mrs Cunningham's guest there. It was one of the very few houses at which  he occasionally dined after he went to Craighouse. Soon after he had  gone to Craighouse, he formed a resolution against dining out _in the  town_. His neighbours in the country were so few that he had no reason  to dread too frequent invitations from them; and he occasionally dined,  as has been said, with Mrs Cunningham at Morton, and with his nearest  neighbour, equally at Craighouse as at Morton, Mr John Skelton, at the  beautiful Hermitage of Braid. Dr Burton was generally invited by the  latter to meet his distinguished friend, the historian, Mr Anthony  Froude. He may during these years have been once or twice a guest at  Colinton House, then inhabited by Lord Dunfermline, and as often at  Bonally, the house of his old friend the late Professor Hodgson. During  his residence at Morton, Dr Burton and his family dined with their  neighbours, Mr and Mrs Stevenson, at Swanston Cottage, once. On one  occasion he was persuaded to actually _drive_ with his wife as far as  Duddingston, where he dined and enjoyed a pleasant summer evening with  Professor and Mrs Laurie and their family. Once he went still farther  and dined with his old friend Mr Jenner, at Easter Duddingston. Mr  Jenner and he had been associated with Lord Murray, Angus Fletcher, and  others, in the foundation of the First Ragged School, as it was then  called, in Edinburgh, and had remained friends ever since. On the  Committee of the Ragged School splitting up on the question of religious  instruction, all the gentlemen named had espoused the principle carried  out in the United Industrial School--that of combined secular and  separate religious instruction.    With these exceptions, and that of a very few visitors at home, the life  at Morton was entirely domestic. During the whole of his three years'  stay at Morton, Dr Burton always hoped to induce the remains of his  circle of old friends to dine with him once more. They had become few  indeed--were limited to Professor Blackie and Dr John Brown. He never  succeeded in persuading these gentlemen to come. Insuperable  difficulties on one side or other always intervened. During these three  years there never was any social gathering at Morton except  entertainments which Dr Burton's family gave to the country people, and  which sometimes included a few young friends as assistants. Dr Burton  was no longer called on to visit his office daily. To attend the Board  meetings once a-week was sufficient.    As soon as he had finished his 'History of Scotland' in 1870, he  conceived the project of writing a 'History of the Reign of Queen Anne.'  It was an ambitious attempt. Lord Macaulay's too early death had  prevented his performing the task, and Mr Thackeray was understood to  have contemplated it, but to have shrunk from its vastness. Dr Burton  had been collecting material for this work in all his summer tours  during the past ten years, and in all his visits to the British Museum  while in London. He had written a great part of it before he was  interrupted by his illness in the end of '77, and the removal from  Craighouse early in '78. The most marked change in Dr Burton after that  illness was in his impaired power of mental application. His general  health was good, even strong; he still enjoyed long rambles with his  sons, and walked to town and back at his former rapid rate; but now that  he had no longer any office work, now that he might sit and read or  write all day if he would, he did not do so. Instead of, as formerly,  resenting all interruption while engaged in his library, he seemed to  seek every excuse for leaving it and his literary occupation. Though  not rising earlier than formerly, he would go to bed comparatively  early, and several times a-day would propose to his wife to go to visit  her flowers, to do a little gardening, to go and feed the fowls--in  short, to share in any little diversion going.    A visit of the writer's to her sister in Argyleshire gave occasion for  the following notes on ballad-lore, in which Major Mackay of Carskey,  Mrs Burton's brother-in-law, was also strong:--         \"MORTON, _2d May 1879_.         \"MY DEAR LOVE,--I recollect having come across the ballad incident       you mention upwards of fifty years ago, when I was zealous in       ballad-lore. If it had been in one of those accepted as genuine and       poetical I would have remembered the ballad, but my impression is       that it was condemned as a fabrication for this and other       neologies. The _button_ is not a conspicuous item of female attire       as of the male, and Shakespeare has been attacked for the vulgarity       of even making Lear say, 'Prithee, undo this button,' though I       think it fine.         \"If the Major is curious in ballad-lore, I can give him abundant       information in it. For the musical item, the best collection I know       is Motherwell's, both for good poetic taste in selection, and the       tunes accompanying some of the contents....--Your affectionate         \"J.H. BURTON.\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"MORTON, _Wednesday Evening_, _8th May 1879_.         \"MY DEAR LOVE,--Looking for the ballad you want, and not finding it       by recollection, I came by accident to the very line--              'When she cam' to her father's land            The tenants a' cam' her to see;            Never a word she could speak to them,            But the buttons aff her claes would flee.'         The ballad is known by the title of The Marchioness of Douglas, but       better known by the--              'O waly, waly, up yon bank,            And waly, waly, doon yon brae.'         It was printed first in Jamieson's collection--1806; again in       Chambers's, p. 150. The 'waly' has been by Cockney critics called       Scotch for 'wail ye.' The word may come from the same etymological       source as 'wail,' but it is a Scots adverb, indicative of the       intensity of sorrow.         \"It will be hard to find any one who is my master in ballad-lore       (though other things have of late taken the preponderance). My       services in the cause are certified by Robert Chambers in his       collection, published in 1829--fifty years ago.         \"I had then collected several versions from old people in       Aberdeenshire. While writing this it dawns on my recollection that       I lost the bulk of the collection, and that some years ago I got a       letter from America, written by some one publishing Scots ballads,       asking me to help him. Making a search for any remnant of the old       collection, I found one ballad only, and sent it. Then came the odd       conclusion--he had the rest of the collection, as he found by       comparison of handwriting.         \"This little affair coming in upon others of so much more moment to       me--I can't tell exactly how many years ago--was forgotten utterly       until your inquiry about the 'buttons' brought it up. When I am       through with 'Queen Anne' I may look back on it and other       trifles....         \"I do not think I have any news for you. Mary says the violet roots       were sent on Monday.--Your affectionate         \"J.H. BURTON.\"    In the summer of 1879 Dr Burton went abroad for the last time, for the  purpose of tracing the course of Marlborough's campaigns. From his daily  letters home a few passages may be selected:--         \"MONS, _18th June 1879_.         \"MY DEAR WILL,--I think you may well write to Ratisbon after       receiving this.         \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22153"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Rome (#13)"],[1,"erva.]    [Illustration: Votive Head.]    As regards the multitude of ex-votos, no other temple or deposit  discovered in my time can be compared with the _favissae_ of the Temple  of Juno at Veii. In Roman traditions this temple was regarded as the  place where Camillus emerged from the _cuniculus_, or mine, on the day  of the capture of the city. The story runs that Camillus, having  carried his _cuniculus_ under the Temple of Juno within the citadel,  overheard the Etruscan _aruspex_ declare to the king of Veii that  victory would rest with him who completed the sacrifice. Upon this,  the Roman soldiers burst through the floor, seized the entrails of the  victims, and bore them to Camillus, who offered them to the goddess  with his own hand, while his followers were gaining possession of the  city. The account is certainly more or less fabricated; but, as Livy  remarks, \"it is not worth while to prove or disprove these things.\" We  are content to know that within the citadel of Veii, the \"Piazza d'  Armi\" of the present day, there was a temple of great veneration and  antiquity, and that it was dedicated to Juno. Both points have been  proved and illustrated by modern discoveries.    [Illustration: The Cliffs under the Citadel of Veii (now called  Piazza d' Armi).]    The ex-votos of the Latin sanctuaries were, as I have just remarked,  buried in the _favissae_; but at Veii, because of the danger and the  difficulty of excavating them within the citadel, and in solid rock,  the ex-votos were carted away and thrown from the edge of the cliff  into the valley below. The place selected was the north side of the  rocky ridge connecting the citadel with the city, which ridge towers  one hundred and ninety-eight feet above the canon of the Cremera. The  mass of objects thrown over here in the course of centuries has  produced a slope which reaches nearly to the top of the cliff. The  reader will appreciate the importance of the deposit from the fact  that the mine has been exploited ever since the time of Alexander VII.  (1655-1667); and in the spring of 1889, when the most recent  excavations were made, by the late empress Theresa of Brazil, the mass  of terra-cottas brought to the surface was such that work had to be  given up after a few days, because there was no more space in the  farmhouse for the storage of the booty. Pietro Sante Bartoli left an  account of the excavations made on the same spot by cardinal Chigi,  during the pontificate of Alexander VII. Modern topographers do not  seem to be aware of this fact; it is not mentioned by Dennis, or Gell,  or Nibby, although it is the only evidence left of the discovery of  the famous sanctuary. \"Not far from the Isola Farnese a hill [the  Piazza d' Armi], rises from the valley of the Cremera, on the plateau  of which cardinal Chigi has discovered a beautiful temple with fluted  columns of the Ionic order. The frieze is carved with trophies and  panoplies of various kinds; the reliefs of the pediment represent the  emperor Antoninus[?] sacrificing a ram and a sow, and although the  panels lie scattered around the temple, and the figures are broken,  apparently no important piece is missing. There is also an altar four  feet high, with figures of Etruscan type, which was removed to the  Palazzo Chigi [now Odescalchi]. The columns and marbles of the temple  were bought by cardinal Falconieri to build and ornament a chapel in  the church of S. Giovanni de' Fiorentini.... Not far from the temple a  stratum of ex-votos has been found, so rich that the whole of Rome is  now overrun with terra-cottas. Every part of the human body is  represented,--heads, hands, feet, fingers, eyes, noses, mouths,  tongues, entrails, lungs, symbols of fecundity, whole figures of men  and women, horses, oxen, sheep, pigs,--in such quantities as to make  several hundred cartloads. There were also bronze statuettes, sacred  utensils, and mirror-cases, which were all stolen or destroyed. I have  known of one workman breaking marvellous objects (_cose insigni_) into  small fragments to melt them into handles for knives.\"    When the farms of Isola Farnese and Vaccareccia, in which the remains  of Veii and of its extensive cemeteries are situated, were sold, a few  years ago, by the empress of Brazil to the marchese Ferraioli, the  parties concerned agreed that the right of excavating and the objects  discovered should belong to her, for a limited number of years, up to  1891, I believe. The first campaign, opened January 2, 1889, and  closed in June, must be considered as one of the most valuable  contributions to the study of Etruscan civilization which have been  supplied of late to students, either by chance or by design. Had the  empress been able to carry out her plans for two or three years more,  the whole city and necropolis would have been explored, surveyed, and  illustrated, in the most strictly scientific manner. Political events  and the death of this noble woman brought the enterprise to a close.  To come back, however, to the bed of votive objects in terra-cotta and  bronze, I was able to make a rough estimate of its dimensions, which  are two hundred and fifty feet in length, fifty feet in width, and  from three to four in depth; nearly forty-four thousand cubic feet.  The objects collected in two weeks number four thousand; the fragments  buried again as worthless, double that number. The heads of veiled  goddesses alone amount to four hundred and forty-seven, of which three  hundred and seventy are full-faced, the rest in profile. The vein  contains fifty-two varieties of types; to Bartoli's list, we must add  busts, masks, arms, breasts, wombs, spines, bowels, lungs, toes,  figures cut open across the breast and showing the anatomy, figures  approximately human, or male and female embryos ending like the trunk  of a tree with stumps corresponding to the feet, figures of  hermaphrodites, human torsos modelled purposely without heads, arms  without hands, legs without feet, hands holding apples or  jewel-caskets, figurines of mothers nursing twins, beautiful  life-sized statues of draped women, with movable hands and feet, rats,  wild boars, sucking pigs, cows, rams, apples and other fruits, and  \"marbles.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The first structures dedicated to the gods in Rome were called _arae_,  and had the shape of a cube of masonry, in the centre of a square  platform. They were modelled, in a measure, on the pattern of the  Pelasgic _hierones_, in which the territory of Tibur and Signia is  especially abundant. The _arae_ best known in Roman history and  topography are six in number, namely, the _ara maxima Herculis_; the  _Roma quadrata_; the _ara Aii Locutii_; the _ara Ditis et  Proserpinae_; the _ara pacis Augustae_; and the _ara incendii  Neroniani_. The oldest of these were built of rough stones; those of  later periods took the characteristic shape of the altar of Verminus,  represented on page 52 of my \"Ancient Rome,\" and of the altar raised  to Vedjovis by the members of the Julian family, at Bovillae, their  birthplace, where it was found by the Colonnas in 1823. It is now in  the villa of that family on the Quirinal.[40] In imperial times the  conventional shape was preserved, with the addition of two _pulvini_,  or volutes, on the opposite edges of the cornice, as represented in  the illustration on page 35 of \"Ancient Rome\" (a marble altar found at  Ostia).    [Illustration: A Pelasgic hieron, or platform of altar, at Segni.]    [Illustration: Round Temple of Hercules in the Forum Boarium.]      THE ARA MAXIMA HERCULIS. This altar, the oldest in Rome, was raised in  memory of the visit of Hercules to our country. Tacitus and Pliny  attribute its construction to Evander the Arcadian, forgetting that in  prehistoric times the tract of land on which the altar stood, between  the Forum Boarium and the Circus Maximus, was submerged by the waters  of the Velabrum. It was at all events a very ancient structure, held  in great veneration. Its rough shape and appearance were never  changed, as shown by a precious--yet unpublished--sketch by  Baldassarre Peruzzi which I found among his autographs in Florence. A  round temple was built near the altar, in later times, of which we  know two particulars: first, that it had a mysterious power of  repulsion for dogs and flies;[41] second, that it contained, among  other works of art, a picture by the poet Pacuvius, next in antiquity  and value to the one painted by Fabius Pictor, in the Temple of  Health, in 303 B. C.[42] The Temple of Hercules, the Ara Maxima, and  the bronze statue of the hero-god were discovered, in a good state of  preservation, during the pontificate of Sixtus IV., between the apse  of S. Maria in Cosmedin (the Temple of Ceres), and the Circus Maximus.  We have a description of the discovery by Pomponio Leto, Albertini,  and Fra Giocondo da Verona; and excellent drawings by Baldassarre  Peruzzi.[43]    Except the bronze statue, and a few votive inscriptions, which were  removed to the Capitoline Museum, everything--temple, altar, and  platform--was levelled to the ground by the illustrious Vandals of the  Renaissance.      THE ROMA QUADRATA. According to the ancient ritual, the founder of a  city, after tracing the _sulcus primigenius_ or furrow which marked  its limits, buried the plough, the instruments of sacrifice, and other  votive offerings, in a round hole, excavated in the centre of the  marked space. The round hole was called _mundus_, and its location was  indicated by a heap of stones, which in course of time took the shape  of a square altar. The _mundus_ of ancient Rome was located in the  very heart of the Palatine, in front of the Temple of Apollo, and the  altar upon it was named the _Roma Quadrata_. This name has been much  discussed, and it has even been applied to the Palatine city itself,  although it is an established fact that there is, strictly"]]]
