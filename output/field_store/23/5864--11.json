In the tenth century such  eminent virtues could not pass unrewarded, and he was advanced to the  Archbishopric of Canterbury in the year 961, but his after life is that  of a saintly politician, and displays nothing that need be mentioned  here.    In the year 969,[99] AElfric, abbot of St. Alban's, was elected archbishop  of Canterbury. His identity is involved in considerable doubt by the many  contemporaries who bore that name, some of whom, like him, were  celebrated for their talent and erudition; but, leaving the solution of  this difficulty to the antiquarian, we are justified in saying that he  was of noble family, and received his education under Ethelwold, at  Abingdon, about the year 960. He accompanied his master to Winchester,  and Elphegus, bishop of that see, entertained so high an opinion of  AElfric's learning and capacity, that he sent him to superintend the  recently founded monastery of Cerne, in Devonshire. He there spent all  his hours, unoccupied by the duties of his abbatical office, in the  transcription of books and the nobler avocations of an author. He  composed a Latin Grammar, a work which has won for him the title of \"_The  Grammarian_,\" and he greatly helped to maintain the purity of the  Christian church by composing a large collection of homilies, which  became exceedingly popular during the succeeding century, and are yet in  existence. The preface to these homilies contain several very curious  passages illustrative of the mode of publication resorted to by the  monkish authors, and on that account I am tempted to make the following  extracts:    \"I, AElfric, the scholar of Ethelwold, to the courteous and venerable  Bishop Sigeric, in the Lord.    \"Although it may appear to be an attempt of some rashness and  presumption, yet have I ventured to translate this book out of the Latin  writers, especially those of the 'Holy Scriptures,' into our common  language; for the edification of the ignorant, who only understand this  language when it is either read or heard. Wherefore I have not used  obscure or unintelligible words, but given the plain English. By which  means the hearts, both of the readers and of the hearers, may be reached  more easily; because they are incapable of being otherwise instructed,  than in their native tongue. Indeed, in our translation, we have not ever  been so studious to render word for word, as to give the true sense and  meaning of our authors. Nevertheless, we have used all diligent caution  against deceitful errors, that we may not be found seduced by any heresy,  nor blinded by any deceit. For we have followed these authors in this  translation, namely, St. Austin of Hippo, St. Jerome, Bede, Gregory,  Smaragdus, and sometimes Haymo, whose authority is admitted to be of  great weight with all the faithful. Nor have we only expounded the  treatise of the gospels;... but have also described the passions and  lives of the saints, for the use of the unlearned of this nation. We have  placed forty discourses in this volume, believing this will be sufficient  for one year, if they be recited entirely to the faithful, by the  ministers of the Lord. But the other book which we have now taken in hand  to compose will contain those passions or treatises which are omitted in  this volume.\" ... \"Now, if any one find fault with our translation, that  we have not always given word for word, or that this translation is not  so full as the treatise of the authors themselves, or that in handling of  the gospels we have run them over in a method not exactly conformable to  the order appointed in the church, let him compose a book of his own; by  an interpretation of deeper learning, as shall best agree with his  understanding, this only I beseech him, that he may not pervert this  version of mine, which I hope, by the grace of God, without any boasting,  I have, according to the best of my skill, performed with all diligence.  Now, I most earnestly entreat your goodness, my most gentle father  Sigeric, that you will vouchsafe to correct, by your care, whatever  blemishes of malignant heresy, or of dark deceit, you shall meet with in  my translation, and then permit this little book to be ascribed to your  authority, and not to the meanness of a person of my unworthy character.  Farewell in the Almighty God continually. Amen.\"[100]    I have before alluded to the care observed by the scribes in copying  their manuscripts, and the moderns may deem themselves fortunate that  they did so; for although many interpolations, or emendations, as they  called them, occur in monkish transcripts, on the whole, their integrity,  in this respect, forms a redeeming quality in connexion with their  learning. In another preface, affixed to the second collection of his  homilies, AElfric thus explains his design in translating them:    \"AElfric, a monk and priest, although a man of less abilities than are  requisite for one in such orders, was sent, in the days of King AEthelred,  from Alphege, the bishop and successor of AEthelwold, to a monastery which  is called Cernel, at the desire of AEthelmer, the Thane, whose noble birth  and goodness is everywhere known. Then ran it in my mind, I trust,  through the grace of God, that I ought to translate this book out of the  Latin tongue into the English language not upon presumption of great  learning, but because I saw and heard much error in many English books,  which ignorant men, through their simplicity, esteemed great wisdom, and  because it grieved me that they neither knew, nor had the gospel learning  in their writing, except from those men that understood Latin, and those  books which are to be had of King Alfred's, which he skilfully translated  from Latin into English.\"[101]    From these extracts we may gain some idea of the state of learning in  those days, and they would seem, in some measure, to justify the opinion,  that the laity paid but little attention to such matters, and I more  anxiously present the reader with these scraps, because they depict the  state of literature in those times far better than a volume of conjecture  could do. It is not consistent with my design to enter into an analysis  of these homilies. Let the reader, however, draw some idea of their  nature from the one written for Easter Sunday, which has been deemed  sufficient proof that the Saxon Church ever denied the Romish doctrine of  transubstantiation; for he there expressly states, in terms so plain  that all the sophistry of the Roman Catholic writers cannot pervert its  obvious meaning, that the bread and wine is only typical of the body and  blood of our Saviour.    To one who has spent much time in reading the lives and writings of the  monkish theologians, how refreshing is such a character as that of  AElfric's. Often, indeed, will the student close the volumes of those old  monastic writers with a sad, depressed, and almost broken heart; so often  will he find men who seem capable of better things, who here and there  breathe forth all the warm aspirations of a devout and Christian heart,  bowed down and grovelling in the dust, as it were, to prove their blind  submission to the Pope, thinking, poor fellows!--for from my very heart I  pity them--that by so doing they were preaching that humility so  acceptable to the Lord.    Cheering then, to the heart it is to find this monotony broken by such an  instance, and although we find AElfric occasionally diverging into the  paths of papistical error, he spreads a ray of light over the gloom of  those Saxon days, and offers pleasing evidence that Christ never forsook  his church; that even amidst the peril and darkness of those monkish ages  there were some who mourned, though it might have been in a monastery,  submissive to a Roman Pontiff, the depravity and corruption with which  the heart of man had marred it.    To still better maintain the discipline of the church, he wrote a set of  canons, which he addressed to Wulfin, or Wulfsine, bishop of Sherbourne.  With many of the doctrines advocated therein, the protestant will not  agree; but the bibliophile will admit that he gave an indication of his  love of books by the 21st Canon, which directs that, \"Before a priest can  be ordained, he must be armed with the sacred books, for the spiritual  battle, namely, a Psalter, Book of Epistles, Book of Gospels, the Missal  Book, Books of Hymns, the Manual, or Euchiridion, the Gerim, the  Passional, the Paenitential, and the Lectionary, or Reading Book; these  the diligent priest requires, and let him be careful that they are all  accurately written, and free from faults.\"[102]    About the same time, AElfric wrote a treatise on the Old and New  Testaments, and in it we find an account of his labors in Biblical  Literature. He did more in laying open the holy mysteries of the gospel  to the perusal of the laity, by translating them into the Saxon tongue,  than any other before him. He gave them, in a vernacular version, the  Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Esther, Job, Judith, two Books of Maccabees,  and a portion of the Book of Kings, and it is for these labors, above all  others, that the bible student will venerate his name, but he will look,  perhaps, anxiously, hopefully, to these early attempts at Bible  propagation, and expect to observe the ecclesiastical orders, at least,  shake off a little of their absurd dependence on secondary sources for  biblical instruction. But, no; they still sadly clung to traditional  interpretation; they read the Word of God mystified by the fathers, good  men, many of them, devout and holy saints, but why approach God through  man, when we have His own prescription, in sweet encouraging words, to  come, however"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#13)"],[1,"\"    \"Why do you pay him that, then?\"    \"It's Mr. Rockwell who pays him, not I. Why he does it, I can't say. It  isn't because he earns it. No boy of his age, or yours either, can earn  ten dollars a week.\"    \"At any rate he gets ten, and I get only four. I certainly earn more  than that,\" said Roswell.    \"I am not so sure about that,\" said his cousin. \"But if it will afford  you any comfort, I'll venture to make the prediction that he won't  remain in Rockwell & Cooper's employment a week longer.\"    \"Has anything happened?\" asked Roswell, eagerly.    \"_Not yet_,\" said James Gilbert, significantly.    \"Then something is going to happen?\"    \"You need not trouble yourself to ask questions. Wait patiently, and  when anything happens I'll let you know.\"    Here James Gilbert left the room, and went up to his own chamber. His  words had excited hope in both Roswell and his mother. The former felt  that it would be a satisfaction to him to learn that Dick had lost his  situation, even if he failed to get it himself.          CHAPTER XI.    A NEW ALLIANCE.      The name of Micky Maguire is already familiar to the readers of \"Ragged  Dick.\" He had acquired a prominent position among the down-town  boot-blacks by his strength, which he used oftentimes to impose upon  boys weaker than himself. He was a young ruffian, indeed, with few  redeeming qualities. When Dick was in the same business, he tried on two  or three occasions to make him acknowledge his superiority; but it was  not in Dick's nature to be subservient to any one whom he did not  respect. Moreover, Dick had two good stout arms of his own, and knew how  to use them in self-defence. The consequence was that Micky Maguire  signally failed in the attempts which he made on different occasions to  humble our hero, and was obliged to slink off in discomfiture with his  satellite, Limpy Jim.    The last glimpse we had of Micky was in Dick's cast-off clothes, of  which by some means, probably not honest, he had become possessed. He  did not wear them long, however. The famous Washington coat and Napoleon  pants were only mortal, and, being already of venerable antiquity,  became at length too fragmentary even for Micky's not very fastidious  taste. One morning, accordingly, having levied an unwilling contribution  from a weaker but more industrious boot-black, Micky went to Baxter  Street, and invested it in a blue coat with brass buttons, which, by  some strange chain of circumstances, had found its way thither from some  country town, where it may at one time have figured at trainings and on  town-meeting days. A pair of overalls completed Micky's costume. He  dispensed with a vest, his money not having been sufficient to buy that  also.    Certainly Micky presented a noticeable figure as he stood in the City  Hall Park, clad in the above-mentioned garments. He was rather proud of  the brass buttons, and may even have fancied, in his uncultivated taste,  that his new costume became him.    While he was swaggering about he espied part of a cigar, which some one  had thrown aside. Micky, who was fond of smoking, picked it up, and  looked about him for a light, not being provided with a match. A young  man was slowly crossing the park with a cigar in his mouth. But he was  evidently plunged in thought, and hardly conscious of the scene about  him. Micky observed this, and a cunning scheme suggested itself.    He walked up to the young man, and said, cavalierly, \"Give us a light,  mister, will yer?\"    The young man mechanically took the cigar from his mouth, and passed it  to the questioner without observing who he was. Had he done so, it is  doubtful whether the request would have been complied with.    Rapidly calculating that he would not notice the substitution, Micky,  after lighting the \"stub,\" handed it to the young man, retaining the  good cigar himself, and placing it straightway in his mouth.    This trick would probably have passed off undetected, if it had not been  observed by some of Micky's fellow-professionals.    A jeering laugh from these called the young man's attention to the  substitution, and, with a look of indignation, he said, \"You young  rascal, you shall pay for this!\"    [Illustration]    But Micky evaded his grasp, and scudded rapidly through the park,  pursued by the victim of misplaced confidence.    \"Run, Micky; I'll bet on you!\" cried Pat Nevins, encouragingly.    \"Go it, long legs!\" said another, who backed the opposite party. \"Give  him a good lickin' when you catch him.\"    \"Maybe you'd have to wait too long for that,\" said Pat.    \"Leave yer cigar wid us, mister,\" said another boy.    James Gilbert, for he was the young man in question, began to find that  he was becoming rather ridiculous, and felt that he would rather let  Micky go free than furnish a spectacle to the crowd of boot-blacks who  were surveying the chase with eager interest. He accordingly stopped  short, and, throwing down the \"stub,\" prepared to leave the park.    \"Don't give it up, mister! You'll catch him,\" said his first backer.  \"Micky can't run far. Ragged Dick give him a stretcher once.\"    \"Ragged Dick!\" said Gilbert, turning abruptly at the sound of this name.    \"Maybe you know him?\"    \"Does he black boots?\"    \"He used to, but he don't now.\"    \"What does he do?\"    \"Oh, he's a swell now, and wears good clothes.\"    \"How is that?\"    \"He's in a store, and gets good pay.\"    \"What's the name of the boy that ran away with my cigar?\"    \"Micky Maguire.\"    \"Was he a friend of Ragged Dick, as you call him?\"    \"Not much. They had two or three fights.\"    \"Which beat?\"    \"Dick. He can fight bully.\"    Gilbert felt disappointed. He was in hopes our hero had met with a  defeat. Somehow he seemed born for success.    \"Then I suppose Maguire hates him?\"    \"I'll bet he does.\"    \"Humph!\" thought Gilbert; \"I may turn his enmity to some account. Let me  consider a little.\"    At length a plan suggested itself, and his countenance cleared up, and  assumed an expression of satisfaction. On reaching home he held the  conversation with Roswell and his mother which has been recorded at the  close of the last chapter.    Meantime Micky went home to a miserable lodging on Worth Street, in the  precincts of the Five Points, and very near where the Five Points House  of Industry now stands. This admirable institution has had a salutary  influence, and contributed greatly to the improvement of the  neighborhood. Then, however, it was about as vile and filthy as could  well be.    Micky exulted not a little at the success of his cunning, and smoked the  cigar--an expensive one, by the way--with not a little satisfaction. He  recounted the story to a group of admiring friends who had not been  fortunate enough to witness it.    \"It's you that's got the cheek, Micky,\" said Teddy Donovan.    \"You did it neat,\" said another. \"Maybe I'll try that same, some day.\"    \"You'd better not. The copp might get hold of you.\"    \"Was it a good cigar, Micky?\"    \"Wasn't it, just! I wish I'd got another. Stand treat, Teddy.\"    \"I would if I had the stamps. I'm savin' up my money to go to the Old  Bowery to-night.\"    The boys were standing in a little group, and in the interest of their  discussion did not observe the approach of James Gilbert, who was now  visiting the park with a special object in view. With an expression of  satisfaction he recognized the boy who had served him a trick the day  before. Indeed, it was not easy to mistake Micky. The blue coat with  brass buttons and the faded overalls would have betrayed him, even if  his superior height had not distinguished him from his comrades.    Had Micky been aware of Gilbert's approach he would have thought it  prudent to \"change his base;\" but, his back being turned, he was taken  by surprise. His attention was drawn by a tap on the shoulder, and,  looking round, he recognized his enemy, as he regarded him. He started  to run, but was withheld by a strong grasp.    \"Leave me alone, will yer?\" he said, ducking his head as if he expected  a blow.    \"I believe you are fond of smoking,\" said Gilbert, continuing to hold  him tight.    Micky maintained silence.    \"And sometimes exchange a poor cigar for a good one?\" continued his  captor.    \"It was a mistake,\" said Micky.    \"What did you run for, then?\"    \"What you going to do about it, mister?\" asked one boy, curiously.    \"So it was a mistake,--was it?\" said Gilbert.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Micky, glibly.    \"Take care you don't make the mistake again, then. Now you may black my  boots.\"    Not only the boys who were standing by, but Micky himself, were  considerably surprised at this unexpected turn. They confidently  expected that Micky would \"get a lickin',\" and instead of that, he had  found a customer. Their respect for Gilbert was considerably diminished  for failing to exact punishment, and, their interest in the affair being  over, they withdrew.    Micky laid down his box, and commenced operations.    \"How long have you been a boot-black?\" asked Gilbert.    \"Five years--goin' on six,\" said Micky.    \"Can you earn much?\"    \"No,\" said Micky. \"Business aint very good now.\"    \"You manage to dress well,\" said Gilbert, with an amused look at Micky's  habiliments.    \"Yes,\" said Micky, with a glance at the brass buttons; \"but I had to  borrer the money to buy my clo'es.\"    \"There used to be a boy around here that was called Dick. Did you know  him?\"    \"There be a good many Dicks. Which did you mean?\"    \"This boy was nearly your size. I believe they called him 'Ragged  Dick.'\"    \"I know'd him,\" said Micky, shortly, with a scowl.    \"Was he a friend of yours?\"    \"No, he wasn't. I give him a lickin' once.\"    The fact happened to be the other way; but Micky was not very scrupulous  as to the strict truth of his statements.    \"You don't like him, then? Where is he now?\"    \"He's in a store, and swells round with good clothes.\"    \"Have you seen him lately?\"    \"No,"]]]
