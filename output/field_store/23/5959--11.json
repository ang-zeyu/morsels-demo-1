Handsome buildings line the shore for about the length of two  miles; splendid palaces, churches, and convents rise tier upon tier on  the steep sides of the hills, whose barren summits are crowned by  formidable-looking forts and ramparts. Immediately behind are the  Apennines, and upon these mountain heights are again several strong  forts commanding the town, which is also enclosed by a double line of  fortifications on the land side. The stern aspect of these works is  relieved by gardens, whose foliage gives the one touch needed to soften  the beauty of the whole. The harbour has a pier at each end, and upon  one of these is a very fine lighthouse.    From time immemorial Genoa has been famous as a seaport, and as the  contemporary and rival of fair Venice, and, like her, has had a proud  and eventful history. How sadly are these splendid cities of the past,  these great and wealthy republics of ancient times, sunk at the present  day to a shadow of their former magnificence and grandeur! Their ruined  splendour alone remains to show us what they were. But it is like gazing  on the beauty of death; the soul, the spirit, is wanting, and we are  continually haunted by the hollow mockery of the empty house which was  once its dwelling. Doubtless the Genoese are proud of their city, yet it  reminds one of the last descendant of a long and ancient pedigree, whose  ancestors were once lords of many a fair manor, but who now has nothing  but his name left, to recall the recollections of bygone days, and  points on this side and on that, with the words \"These lands once  belonged to my illustrious family, of which I am the sole  representative.\"    Baedeker says, \"The beauty of its situation, and the interesting  reminiscence of its ancient magnificence, render a visit to Genoa very  attractive, especially to the traveller who is visiting Italy for the  first time.... The Renaissance palaces are objects of extreme interest,  surpassing in number and magnificence those of any other city in Italy.  Many of the smaller churches are of very ancient origin, though usually  altered in the Gothic period.\"    The many splendid palaces of the old nobility, with all their art  treasures and galleries of fine paintings by the great masters, have  been left to the city as a free gift, with the stipulation of their  being open to visitors. Rubens and Vandyke both resided here, and there  are a number of their greatest works to be seen. As an example of the  wealth of the nobles even at the present day, and their patriotic pride  in their city, the Duke of Galliera, who died in 1876, presented twenty  million francs for the improvement of the harbour, on condition that the  Government would advance the remainder of the sum required, and the work  is now in progress.    This semicircular harbour is crowded with shipping, while all around are  large warehouses, and stretching along the edge is a superb promenade of  white marble on raised arches. The Gulf of Genoa is very stormy, and  there are but few fish to be found in it.    The streets are paved with stone which tires one to walk on. Many of  them are dark and crooked, particularly in the interior of the town and  near the sea, and so steep and narrow that in some of them a carriage  cannot pass through. Most people will remember Dickens' amusing remarks  on this subject in his \"Pictures of Italy.\"    Some of the streets, however, are very fine. The Via Roma stretches up  the hill, and descends in an almost unbroken line to the valleys beneath  the mountains, and is remarkably clean and pleasant. On either side are  houses of stone, with overhanging roofs. In the Via Carlo Felice is the  Via Carlo Felice Theatre, the third largest in Italy. The Via Garibaldi  has no less than eighteen splendid marble palaces in succession, while  the fine streets, Nuovissima, Balbi, and Carlo Alberto, are also lined  with these grand old palaces of the Genoese nobility. Many of them  contain rare and magnificent works of art, and their furniture and  decorations are rich and beautiful in the extreme. They are usually on  view from ten till three, on payment of a small fee to the keeper. In  each saloon you find catalogues of the pictures, amongst which the works  of Rubens, Titian, Correggio, and Vandyke are conspicuous.    Palace after palace, gallery after gallery; it is really _embarras de  richesse_, and one gets quite bewildered with the wealth of artistic  genius.    The churches are also very fine, but many of them are left in a very  unfinished condition. The Capuchin church of St. Annunziata, in the  Piazza del Annunziata, erected in 1587, has a portal upborne by marble  columns, while the brick facade is left quite unfinished, with great  holes between the brick and mortar, where seemingly the scaffold-poles  had been inserted, and in which the birds have built their nests. The  interior presents a striking contrast in its splendid and almost  over-gorgeous decorations. It is in the form of a cross, with a dome,  the vaulting supported by twelve fluted and inlaid columns, richly  gilded and painted. But a far more interesting church is the old  Cathedral of San Lorenzo, in the Piazza of the same name, and close to  the Via Carlo Felice. It is in the Gothic style, or rather represents  three different periods, the Romanique, the French Gothic, and the  Renaissance. It was mostly built about the year 1100, and restored in  1300. It has a triple portal, with deep-recessed, pointed arches. Above  these are several rows of arcades, a small rose window, and a tower  with a little dome at the top, two hundred feet high. At the south  corner above the central door is a bas-relief of the martyrdom of St.  Lawrence, its patron saint, and many quaint carvings of monsters. The  beautiful and curiously twisted columns, triple portals, arches, and  arcades, as well as the whole facade and front exterior, are of black  and white marbles; and there is some very fine bronze-work, painting,  and statuary. In the sacristy they show the Sacred _Catina_ (basin), a  six-sided piece of glass brought from Caesarea in 1101, and reported to  be that which held the Paschal lamb at the Last Supper of our Lord. It  was given out to be a pure emerald, till the mistake was detected by a  scientific judge. It may be seen for five francs--a large fee, evidently  charged in the hope of some day making up for its deceptive intrinsic  worth. Like Westminster Abbey, the interior of this church has the  impress of antiquity, especially in its worn columns. I was invited by  the old verger to view the Sacred Chapel of St. John the Baptist, but my  wife was mysteriously prohibited, as women had been concerned in the  saint's martyrdom. I believe this stern order is waived once a year,  probably by payment of a pretty large fee for conciliation. There are  other chapels, paintings, and relics that are well worthy the trouble  and time of study, making this ancient cathedral the most interesting  duomo in Genoa.    St. Ambrogio, in the Via del Sellag, is rich in pictures: Ruben's  \"Circumcision,\" and his \"St. Ignatius,\" healing a man possessed of an  evil spirit, and also Guido's \"Assumption.\" It is splendid in colouring  and wonderful in the elaboration of detail. These to some may appear too  extravagant. The Santa Maria di Carignano, or Church of the Assumption,  in the same street, is one of the finest in Genoa. The walk from here,  along the walls and ramparts of St. Chiara, gives a splendid view.    Many other churches, some sixty in number, are well worth a visit; but,  like the palaces, they require considerable time to properly appreciate  them.    One scarcely likes to see all these gorgeous buildings, with so lavish a  display of the money laid out on their profuse decoration, when the  mendicant poor, the halt, maimed, and blind are crowding the porches,  piteously begging alms; it spoils your pleasure and study of these  beautiful edifices. We ought, however, to recollect that at home we have  our crossing-sweepers, match and flower sellers, and many wretched  objects of suffering and poverty, who perhaps make a similar impression  on foreigners visiting our great and prosperous London, but who will  perhaps marvel also at our lukewarmness and niggardliness in beautifying  our St Paul's and other churches.    At the commencement of our stay here the weather was warm and bright,  but on the day following our arrival a most sudden change occurred, and  it was very wet, and on Sunday bitterly cold. We went to the English  church, and afterwards walked to the top of the fine street leading from  the Carlo Felice, right up the valley at the foot of the mountains, and  there we had a most glorious view. The Campo Santo in the distance; the  harbour on the right; and the great hills, with their strong forts  perched on every projecting point and pinnacle, all covered with snow;  quite a white world since the day before. We saw ice in the streets, and  were glad to return to the Hotel Isotta. The poor fasting Priests seemed  quite nipped up; and the Genoese ladies, who under more favourable  circumstances would have been graceful and good-looking, appeared  unaccustomed to this severity of weather, and hurried along with red  noses and pinched faces.    Of all our visits to interesting places in this ancient city our  excursion to the Campo Santo gave us the most pleasure. It is some three  or four miles from the city: the weather continuing cold, we preferred  walking. We went up the main street, through the valley at the foot of  the snow-clad hills we had seen before, and in little more than an hour  we arrived at the gates of the Cemetery. This Campo Santo is indeed most  eloquently illustrative of loving reverence and remembrance of the dead,  and is quite a museum of beautiful monumental"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#13)"],[1,"or not I prate.    XXIV    But, O ye tomes without compare,  Which from the devil's bookcase start,  Albums magnificent which scare  The fashionable rhymester's heart!  Yea! although rendered beauteous  By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,  Though Baratynski verses penned,(45)  The thunderbolt on you descend!  Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame  Presents her quarto amiably,  Despair and anger seize on me,  And a malicious epigram  Trembles upon my lips from spite,--  And madrigals I'm asked to write!    [Note 45: Count Tolstoy, a celebrated artist who subsequently  became Vice-President of the Academy of Arts at St. Petersburg.  Baratynski, see Note 43.]    XXV    But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote  In Olga's album, youthful maid,  To purest love he tuned his note  Nor frigid adulation paid.  What never was remarked or heard  Of Olga he in song averred;  His elegies, which plenteous streamed,  Both natural and truthful seemed.  Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise(46)  In amorous flights when so inspired,  Singing God knows what maid admired,  And all thy precious elegies,  Sometime collected, shall relate  The story of thy life and fate.    [Note 46: Yazykoff, a poet contemporary with Pushkin. He was  an author of promise--unfulfilled.]    XXVI    Since Fame and Freedom he adored,  Incited by his stormy Muse  Odes Lenski also had outpoured,  But Olga would not such peruse.  When poets lachrymose recite  Beneath the eyes of ladies bright  Their own productions, some insist  No greater pleasure can exist  Just so! that modest swain is blest  Who reads his visionary theme  To the fair object of his dream,  A beauty languidly at rest,  Yes, happy--though she at his side  By other thoughts be occupied.    XXVII    But I the products of my Muse,  Consisting of harmonious lays,  To my old nurse alone peruse,  Companion of my childhood's days.  Or, after dinner's dull repast,  I by the button-hole seize fast  My neighbour, who by chance drew near,  And breathe a drama in his ear.  Or else (I deal not here in jokes),  Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,  I sail upon my lake at times  And terrify a swarm of ducks,  Who, heard the music of my lay,  Take to their wings and fly away.    XXVIII    But to Oneguine! _A propos_!  Friends, I must your indulgence pray.  His daily occupations, lo!  Minutely I will now portray.  A hermit's life Oneguine led,  At seven in summer rose from bed,  And clad in airy costume took  His course unto the running brook.  There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned  His Hellespont from bank to bank,  And then a cup of coffee drank,  Some wretched journal in his hand;  Then dressed himself...(*)    [Note: Stanza left unfinished by the author.]    XXIX    Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,  The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,  The uncontaminated kiss  Of a young dark-eyed country maid,  A fiery, yet well-broken horse,  A dinner, whimsical each course,  A bottle of a vintage white  And solitude and calm delight.  Such was Oneguine's sainted life,  And such unconsciously he led,  Nor marked how summer's prime had fled  In aimless ease and far from strife,  The curse of commonplace delight.  And town and friends forgotten quite.    XXX    This northern summer of our own,  On winters of the south a skit,  Glimmers and dies. This is well known,  Though we will not acknowledge it.  Already Autumn chilled the sky,  The tiny sun shone less on high  And shorter had the days become.  The forests in mysterious gloom  Were stripped with melancholy sound,  Upon the earth a mist did lie  And many a caravan on high  Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.  A weary season was at hand--  November at the gate did stand.    XXXI    The morn arises foggy, cold,  The silent fields no peasant nears,  The wolf upon the highways bold  With his ferocious mate appears.  Detecting him the passing horse  snorts, and his rider bends his course  And wisely gallops to the hill.  No more at dawn the shepherd will  Drive out the cattle from their shed,  Nor at the hour of noon with sound  Of horn in circle call them round.  Singing inside her hut the maid  Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,  The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.    XXXII    Already crisp hoar frosts impose  O'er all a sheet of silvery dust  (Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,  There! take it quickly, if ye must).  Behold! than polished floor more nice  The shining river clothed in ice;  A joyous troop of little boys  Engrave the ice with strident noise.  A heavy goose on scarlet feet,  Thinking to float upon the stream,  Descends the bank with care extreme,  But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet  The first bright wreathing storm of snow  Which falls in starry flakes below.    XXXIII    How in the country pass this time?  Walking? The landscape tires the eye  In winter by its blank and dim  And naked uniformity.  On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!  Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep  His footing on the treacherous rime  And may fall headlong any time.  Alone beneath your rooftree stay  And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!(47)  Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?  Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day  Will pass; the same to-morrow try--  You'll spend your winter famously!    [Note 47: The Abbe de Pradt: b. 1759, d. 1837. A political  pamphleteer of the French Revolution: was at first an emigre,  but made his peace with Napoleon and was appointed Archbishop  of Malines.]    XXXIV    A true Childe Harold my Eugene  To idle musing was a prey;  At morn an icy bath within  He sat, and then the livelong day,  Alone within his habitation  And buried deep in meditation,  He round the billiard-table stalked,  The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;  When evening o'er the landscape looms,  Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,  A table to the fire is brought,  And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,  Driving abreast three horses gray.  \"Bring dinner now without delay!\"    XXXV    Upon the table in a trice  Of widow Clicquot or Moet  A blessed bottle, placed in ice,  For the young poet they display.  Like Hippocrene it scatters light,  Its ebullition foaming white  (Like other things I could relate)  My heart of old would captivate.  The last poor obol I was worth--  Was it not so?--for thee I gave,  And thy inebriating wave  Full many a foolish prank brought forth;  And oh! what verses, what delights,  Delicious visions, jests and fights!    XXXVI    Alas! my stomach it betrays  With its exhilarating flow,  And I confess that now-a-days  I prefer sensible Bordeaux.  To cope with Ay no more I dare,  For Ay is like a mistress fair,  Seductive, animated, bright,  But wilful, frivolous, and light.  But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend  Who in the agony of grief  Is ever ready with relief,  Assistance ever will extend,  Or quietly partake our woe.  All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!    XXXVII    The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak  The golden ember now enshrines,  And barely visible the smoke  Upward in a thin stream inclines.  But little warmth the fireplace lends,  Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,  The goblet still is bubbling bright--  Outside descend the mists of night.  How pleasantly the evening jogs  When o'er a glass with friends we prate  Just at the hour we designate  The time between the wolf and dogs--  I cannot tell on what pretence--  But lo! the friends to chat commence.    XXXVIII    \"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,  Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?\"  \"The family are all quite well--  Give me just half a glass of wine--  They sent their compliments--but oh!  How charming Olga's shoulders grow!  Her figure perfect grows with time!  She is an angel! We sometime  Must visit them. Come! you must own,  My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,  For twice you came to them and yet  You never since your nose have shown.  But stay! A dolt am I who speak!  They have invited you this week.\"    XXXIX    \"Me?\"--\"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete  Next Saturday. The Larina  Told me to ask you. Ere that date  Make up your mind to go there.\"--\"Ah!  It will be by a mob beset  Of every sort and every set!\"  \"Not in the least, assured am I!\"  \"Who will be there?\"--\"The family.  Do me a favour and appear.  Will you?\"--\"Agreed.\"--\"I thank you, friend,\"  And saying this Vladimir drained  His cup unto his maiden dear.  Then touching Olga they depart  In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!    XL    He was most gay. The happy date  In three weeks would arrive for them;  The secrets of the marriage state  And love's delicious diadem  With rapturous longing he awaits,  Nor in his dreams anticipates  Hymen's embarrassments, distress,  And freezing fits of weariness.  Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,  In life domestic see a string  Of pictures painful harrowing,  A novel in Lafontaine's style,  My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,  He seemed for matrimony born.    XLI    He was beloved: or say at least,  He thought so, and existence charmed.  The credulous indeed are blest,  And he who, jealousy disarmed,  In sensual sweets his soul doth steep  As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,  Or, parable more flattering,  As butterflies to blossoms cling.  But wretched who anticipates,  Whose brain no fond illusions daze,  Who every gesture, every phrase  In true interpretation hates:  Whose heart experience icy made  And yet oblivion forbade.      End of Canto The Fourth        CANTO THE FIFTH    The Fete    'Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,     O my Svetlana.'--Joukovski    Canto The Fifth    [Note: Mikhailovskoe, 1825-6]    I    That year the autumn season late  Kept lingering on as loath to go,  All Nature winter seemed to await,  Till January fell no snow--  The third at night. Tattiana wakes  Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,  Park, garden, palings, yard below  And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;  Upon the windows tracery,  The trees in silvery array,  Down in the courtyard magpies gay,  And the far mountains daintily  O'erspread with Winter's carpet"]]]
