The laboratory has to analyze the conditions for  such methods and the psychologist has to prepare the means for the use  of the physician, just as the chemist has to prepare the sleeping  powders. In a similar way the laboratory may furnish means to analyze  the mental disturbances by a comparison with the experimental results of  artificial influences, for instance, of over-fatigue or half-sleep, of  drugs or alcohol, of poisons and emotional excitements. The  psychological resolving of the mental symptoms may of course, in the  same way, furnish the diagnosis where the mental variation is only a  distant effect of a bodily ailment. The changes in the emotions, for  instance, may lead to the recognition of a heart disease; lack of  attention may be a hint of the overgrowth of the adenoids; irritability  or apathy or delirious character of the mental behavior may indicate  whether uraemic acid is in the system or an infectious disease: anaemia  and undernutrition may be diagnosed and the psychology of fever demands  too a much closer analysis with the means of the psychological  laboratory than it has received so far.    We have not spoken as yet about those psychological methods which  themselves introduce abnormal mental states like hypnotism, and which  also not seldom are only means for diagnostic purposes. The hypnotic  state may bring to memory forgotten experiences of which the  physiological effects may have lasted in the brain and which may have  brought injury to the psychophysical system. Hypnotic inquiry can thus  lead to the recognition of the first causes in many hysterical states  and where hypnotism is not the best adjusted tool, a certain dreamlike  staring may be more effective. We have to return to much of that later  in full detail because just for instance in hysteria, the clear  recognition of the sources and of the character of the disease may at  the same time prove to be in itself the right starting point for  curative treatment.    We have spoken so far only about the relations of psychology and  medicine from the point of view of diagnosis; the relations from the  point of view of therapy will make up the second part of this book. We  shall describe the methods and the results, the possibilities and the  limitations with manifold detail. That is the chief topic of this  volume. All that is needed to prepare for this principal problem is on  the one side a preparatory clearing up of some fundamental conceptions,  especially of those two which have played the chief role in the whole  discussion, namely the subconscious and suggestion. And on the other  side, we may consider at first some fundamental discriminations which  steadily influence the inquiries and controversies in the field. I think  of the difference between normal and abnormal mental states, between  psychical and physical facts in psychotherapy, between functional and  organic diseases, and to return to our starting point, between mental  and moral influences.    Every curative effort presupposes that the normal state of health has  been lost and that a diseased state has set in. Yet the mental analysis  suggests still less than the bodily inquiry, just where the normal  functioning is really lost. It would be easy to draw a demarcation line  if the pathology of the mind introduced any mental features which are  unknown in our normal existence, but the opposite is true. No mental  disease introduces elements which do not occur in the sphere of health.  A degenerated brain cell looks differently under the microscope from a  normal one, but the ideas of a paranoiac, the emotion of a maniac, the  volition of a hysteric, the memory idea of a paralytic is each in its  own structure not different from such elements in any one of us. The  total change lies thus only in the proportion; there is too much or too  little of it. The pathological mental life is like a caricature of a  face--each feature is contained, as in the ordinary portrait, but the  proportion is distorted, there is too much or too little of chin or of  nose. But who can indicate exactly the point where the distortion of the  features constitutes a caricature? Every grotesque change in the  relations ruins the healthy state: what makes us sure that the harmony  of health is spoiled?    Certainly we cannot settle it by mere statistics. The norm never means  merely a majority. Even if the overwhelmingly larger part of mankind  suffered from phthisis, the few who were free from it would be  recognized as well and all the others would be considered ill. In mental  life still more, no one ought to propose that the exceptional function  is the symptom of disease. The few persons who never had a dream in  their lives differ much in their mental experience from the large  majority and yet their peculiarity is certainly not a symptom which  needs curative treatment. The only real test of health is the  serviceableness to the needs of life. We have an unhealthy state of the  personality before us wherever the equilibrium of the human functions is  disturbed in a way which diminishes the chances of existence, and the  seriousness of the ailment depends upon the degree of this diminishing  power. Seen from a strictly psychological point of view, we must expect  thus a broad borderland region between the entirely normal well-balanced  mental life and that unbalanced disorder of functions which really  interferes with the chance for self-protection and effectiveness. That  the melancholic who declines to take any nourishment, or the paranoiac  who misjudges his surroundings, is unable to secure by his own energies  the safety of his life cannot be doubted. The balance is completely  destroyed and the will and the intellect of the physician and of the  nurse must be substituted for his own mental powers, if his life is to  be prolonged at all. But the misjudgment and the depression of the  insane are only an exaggeration of that which may occur in any man.    There are therefore thousands of steps which lead from the normal error  or regret to the destructive disturbance. Everyone knows persons whose  pessimistic temperament makes them inclined to an over-frequent  depression, or others whose silly disposition brings out constantly  those emotional tendencies which the maniac shows in an exaggerated  degree. The stupid mind shows those lacks of association and connection  which reach their maximum degree in the mind of the idiot. We know from  daily life the timid, undecided man who cannot come to a will impulse;  the hasty man who rushes towards decisions; the inattentive man who can  never focus his consciousness; and the overattentive man who can never  dismiss any subject; the indifferent man on whom nothing produces  evident impression and feeling; the over-sensitive man who reacts on  slight impressions with exaggerated emotion; and yet every one of such  and a thousand similar variations, needs only the projection on a larger  scale to demonstrate a mental life which is self-destructive. The silly  girl and the stupid boy, the man who has the blues and the reckless  creature, are certainly worse equipped for the struggles of existence  than those who are intellectually and emotionally and volitionally  well-balanced. They will take wrong steps in life, they may be  unsuccessful, their stupidity may lead them to the poorhouse, their  recklessness may lead them to the penitentiary. And yet we do not speak  of them as patients because their disproportionate mental features may  be sufficiently corrected by other mental states which are perhaps more  strongly developed.    Further, inasmuch as human life just in its mental functions is related  to its social surroundings, much must depend on the external conditions,  whether the disproportion and abnormality has to be treated as  pathological. The mind which may find perhaps its way under the most  simple rural conditions would be unable to protect life under the  complex conditions of a great city. The man who in certain surroundings  may appear a crank has to be treated as a patient in a different set of  life conditions. Wherever psychotherapeutic work is in question, perhaps  nothing is more important than to keep steadily in mind this continuity  between normal and abnormal mental features. The mental disturbance must  constantly be looked upon as a change of proportions between functions  which, as such, belong to every normal life. We have to train and to  develop, and thus to reenforce, that which is too weak, and we have to  drain off and to suppress and to inhibit that which is too strong.    Yet just this functional view of disease must remind us strongly from  the beginning that it would be utterly in vain to draw any demarcation  line between psychical disturbances and physical ones. We have seen from  the start that from the point of view of physiological psychology,  there can be no psychical process without an accompanying physiological  process in the brain. Every disturbance in mental actions is thus at the  same time a disturbance in the equilibrium of nervous functions. Yet  that alone would not exclude the possibility of considering some  diseases, for instance, exclusively from the mental side, and we should  be justified in doing so if those parts of the brain which are the seat  of the mental processes could remain in the diseased state without  influence on other parts of the nervous system and of the whole body. In  such a case it would indeed be sufficient to consider the psychophysical  disturbance from the psychological point of view only, that is, to speak  of the disease as a disorder of intellect, of emotion or will, without  thinking of changes in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22776"],[0,"From a Terrace in Prague (#13)"],[1," every part of his dominion. The Church feast of  Cosmas and Damian, much patronized by Wenceslaus at a little town  called Boleslav, was due on September 28th. Wenceslaus was invited to  attend this function by Brother Boleslav, who resided there. Boleslav,  by this time very weary of his pious brother, sat up with a few friends  of his own way of thinking, waylaid Wenceslaus, and killed him. This  happened in 935, and the 28th of September is still kept sacred to the  memory of St. Wenceslaus by those who feel inclined that way.    My sympathy with Boleslav does not blind me to the fact that he did  wrong in killing his brother. I am glad to report that Boleslav showed  signs of contrition. The town of Boleslav henceforth became distasteful  to him, so he quitted it and raised another of the same name. Stara  (Old) Boleslav, where Wenceslaus gained his degree of martyrdom, is a  sedate little town near the banks of the Labe (known as Elbe in Germany)  dozing among orchards and lush meadows and o'ershadowed by tall  elm-trees. It is by no means a suitable setting for a sensational  fratricide; I have been to see the place for myself and consider that  the Wenceslaus-Boleslav, drama requires a different scenario. The newer  town, Young Boleslav (Jung Bunzlau in German) is much better suited to  the film; it stands up high on a rock and looks a likely habitation for  an expert in assassination such as was Boleslav, brother of Wenceslaus.    Despite all Boleslav's efforts, popular opinion has it that Wenceslaus  is not dead, but fast asleep inside a mountain, making up for nights  spent in prayer no doubt. I do not believe this report.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: OLD BOLESLAV.]    Boleslav succeeded Wenceslaus as first Bohemian Prince of that name. His  was a long and eventful reign, from 936 to 967, long at least for those  days when rulers were apt to be removed abruptly. None knew this better  than Boleslav himself. Monkish chroniclers have little good to say of  Boleslav I--allegedly on account of that little affair at Stara  Boleslav and of Boleslav's persistent paganism; actually, I imagine, on  account of the anti-German attitude he adopted at the outset of his  reign. Boleslav ruled with a firm hand; he subdued a number of Bohemian  nobles who had allied themselves with the national enemy the German,  before he resumed the conflict with Henry the Fowler which his mother  had started. Henry, no doubt, was quite ready to quarrel, using the  murder of his ally as a pretext, but he died before he had had time to  settle down in the saddle, and left his son Otto to carry on. Now Otto,  first German Emperor of that name, was a strong man, and is called Great  on account of his success in reviving the Holy Roman Empire. Boleslav  was a strong man too: Palacky, the famous Bohemian historian, describes  him as \"one of the most powerful monarchs that ever occupied the  Bohemian throne.\" He succeeded in defending his country from the armies  that Otto launched against it, and even the invasion of 950, led by the  Emperor himself, brought no decisive victory for the Germans. Boleslav  seems to have considered it futile to continue quarrelling with his  western neighbour, especially as the usual trouble continued in the  east, in which direction the Prince proposed to extend his dominions. By  955 we find Germans and Bohemians allied against the Magyars, who had  acquired a habit of ravaging Western Europe once a year. They met their  match on the Lechfeld, near Augsburg, and were utterly defeated in one  of the most sanguinary and decisive battles fought during the Middle  Ages. According to Count Luetzow it appears that a Bohemian contingent of  a thousand men formed part of the victorious army. Boleslav himself,  with the greater part of his troops, remained to guard the frontiers of  his country. The defeated Magyars suffered another defeat at the hands  of Boleslav on their retreat through Bohemia, and their leader, Lehel,  was taken prisoner. With peace and friendliness on his western front and  his eastern enemy thoroughly beaten, Boleslav was in a position to carry  out his ambitious plans. He freed Moravia from the Magyars and united it  to Bohemia, and he is said to have conquered a considerable part of the  country between the Carpathian Mountains and the Danube; probably  Slovakia of to-day. By his conquests Boleslav became a near neighbour of  Poland and managed to come to a good understanding with Duke Mieceslav  I, ruler of that country, by giving that prince his daughter Dubravka in  marriage, which would no doubt be considered a friendly act. Dubravka  succeeded in converting her husband and his yet heathen people to  Christianity. Mieceslav must have taken to it very strongly, for between  them he and Dubravka produced a pious son and heir who was to become  known as Boleslav the Brave.    Boleslav II of Bohemia, called \"the Pious,\" enjoyed an even longer reign  than his father did, from 967 to 999, which is one of those easy dates  to remember. Monkish chroniclers seem to have ascribed a good deal of  the work done by Boleslav I to his son, probably on account of the  former's lack of piety in his early days and the latter's exuberance in  that line. Certain it is that Boleslav II was ruler over larger  dominions than had ever been held by any Prince or King of Bohemia.  Besides Bohemia itself the power of Boleslav II extended over Moravia,  present-day Slovakia, a great part of Silesia, including Breslau,  districts of Poland nearly up to the town of Lemberg, with a frontier  touching that of the Russian rulers of Kiev. The Bohemian nobles who had  troubled his father were entirely suppressed by Boleslav II, who  appointed burgraves called \"z[vu]pans,\" over the various districts into  which his territories were divided, and the central authority became  absolute.    It is not certain whether Vy[vs]ehrad was still the actual seat of  government or whether the Hrad[vs]any had taken its place. Certain it is  that the Hrad[vs]any had grown in importance chiefly in the religious  life of the nation. The foundations laid by St. Wenceslaus were  extended. It appears that the Church of St. George on the Hrad[vs]any  dates back to this early period; you can see its two rather stunted  white steeples standing out over the complex of buildings near the  eastern point of the Castle Hill before it dips down towards the Vltava.  The earliest church on this point is attributed to Vratislav, uncle of  St. Wenceslaus, but this sounds rather doubtful. Boleslav II, however,  is known to have founded a convent here, probably the oldest in Bohemia,  and he installed his sister Milada as first abbess. St. Ludmilla was  also buried here, so the Hrad[vs]any was increasing in sanctity.  Boleslav II is also responsible for providing Prague with her first  bishop. We have seen that Henry the Fowler had incorporated Bohemia into  the bishopric of Ratisbon; this was before that country could be  considered as Christian, with right, as we have noticed the lapse after  the demise of St. Wenceslaus. Boleslav II, however, was in a position to  point to a much improved state of affairs, and so Otto I consented to  the formation of a separate bishopric of Prague. The Pope consented  likewise, under the express condition that the connection with the old  Moravian archbishopric should be broken, and that the Latin liturgy only  should be used. The German connection was further strengthened by  placing Bohemia under the supremacy of the Archbishop of Maintz;  Thietmar, a German, became the first Bishop of Prague. This worthy was  succeeded after a few years by a native of Bohemia, Adalbert, who  finally established Christianity in the country. He had a hard task, as  many heathen customs, such as polygamy, were difficult to extirpate;  there are even in this day very few churches dedicated to St. Anthony, a  saint who does not seem to interest or convince the Bohemians. Adalbert  carried his ideals farther afield, to the country of the heathen  Prussians, who killed him for trespassing on ground dedicated to one of  their deities. Adalbert became the third saint and martyr of Bohemian  origin, and was adopted by the Poles as patron saint.    Though there are no buildings other than those on the Hrad[vs]any  mentioned by the chroniclers, we may assume that a township was growing  up by the river at the feet of the Castle Hill. We have the testimony of  Ibrahim Ibn Jacub, who speaks of Prague as \"a great commercial town of  stone-built houses.\" Ibrahim's visit must have taken place in the reign  of Boleslav II. I conclude that he was talking of a town on the left  bank of the Vltava, because others of his race who came here in that  Prince's day are said to have been allowed to found a school in the Mala  Strana quarter. Some fifty years later yet more Jews came to Prague  bringing presents for the ruler, Prince Vratislav, and Bishop Gebhard.  They were allowed to build twelve little houses on the outskirts of the  town, which would be somewhere about the Harrachove. These Jews promised  to be of good behaviour and to pay double taxes, but in three months  their numbers had increased to seven hundred, so half of them were  ordered to go out over the river to where the old town now stands;  another Jewish settlement was established there. The advent of these  visitors is proof positive that Prague was becoming not only habitable  but also a place of importance.
