The giants did not do things  by halves, and the Hestmand was so angry that he meant to kill the  maiden, and he shot at her with a giant arrow, which was a fairly  large fir-tree. Now, just at the moment that he shot his arrow, the  maiden's brother, who was another giant, realized what was going on,  and flung his hat between his sister and the arrow. The maiden was  saved, but the arrow pierced the hat. Then the sun suddenly appeared  above the horizon, and the actors in the tragedy were instantly turned  into stone. Hestmanden is the wicked giant on his horse; Torghatten  is the hat which was pierced by the arrow; the arrow itself may be  seen, as a great stone pinnacle, on a neighbouring island; while  Lekoemoen, the mountain on Lekoe, is the beautiful maiden who caused  all the trouble.    But to continue the voyage. Immediately after passing Hestmanden  the Arctic Circle is crossed, and a few hours later a call is made  at the little town of Bodoe. Thence to the Lofoedden Islands is no  great distance, and after they have been visited and the wonderful  cod drying-grounds inspected, the steamer wends its way to Tromsoe,  and then to Hammerfest, which we have already referred to as a great  place for the manufacture of cod-liver oil. Beyond this the rocky  coast presents a succession of rugged and wild capes and promontories  until the object of the voyage at length comes in sight.    The North Cape, the northernmost point of Norway, is a rocky headland  on Mageroe Island--the end of all things, rising a thousand feet above  the deep blue Arctic sea. The climb up the steep, zigzag pathway  from the spot where the steamer lands you is arduous, and you will  be glad of the rest by King Oscar's column. You would have been glad  if a score of other passengers had not been with you, and still more  glad if you had come here half a century earlier, before the hand of  man had marked the spot, and before all your distant friends expected  you to post them a postcard from the North Cape.    Still, something of romance remains as, gazing northwards, you  remember that, except, perhaps, for a corner of Spitzbergen, nothing  intervenes between you and the North Pole--only that barrier of ice  which, so far, has defied all penetration. But this is mere sentiment,  and you have come to see something else--the merging of sunset with  sunrise. Du Chaillu well describes the scene: \"The brilliancy of the  splendid orb varies in intensity, like that of sunset and sunrise,  according to the state of moisture of the atmosphere. One day it will  be of a deep red colour, tingeing everything with a roseate hue,  and producing a drowsy effect. There are times when the changes in  the colour between the sunset and sunrise might be compared to the  variations of a charcoal fire, now burning with a fierce red glow,  then fading away, and rekindling with greater brightness.    \"There are days when the sun has a pale, whitish appearance, and when  even it can be looked at for six or seven hours before midnight. As  this hour approaches the sun becomes less glaring, gradually changing  into more brilliant shades as it dips towards the lowest point of its  course. Its motion is very slow, and for quite a while it apparently  follows the line of the horizon, during which there seems to be a  pause, as when the sun reaches noon. This is midnight. For a few  minutes the glow of sunset mingles with that of sunrise, and one  cannot tell which prevails; but soon the light becomes slowly and  gradually more brilliant, announcing the birth of another day, and  often before an hour has elapsed the sun becomes so dazzling that  one cannot look at it with the natural eye.\"    Such is the wondrous sight, and all through the summer, even before  and after the period of the non-setting of the sun, the nights are  almost as light as day. Indeed, all over Norway, far to the south  of the Arctic Circle, the summer nights are remarkably short--not  altogether an unmixed blessing to those who find it difficult to  sleep in daylight.    But what a change comes over these northern lands in winter! At  the North Cape the sun sets on November 18, not to rise again until  January 24, and everywhere within the Arctic Circle there is a time  of continuous night. To us, who have no experience of such a state of  affairs, it seems as if life must be bereft of all its pleasures. Yet  the dwellers in the Arctic regions think nothing of it. To them even  the dark winter has its charms, for, as has been said of a certain  gentleman, it is not really as black as it has been painted.    In the first place, there is the snow, covering everything, and even  at the darkest time of year there is sufficient light, if the sky be  clear, to see to read for an hour before and an hour after midday. Then  there is the light given by the moon and stars, and lastly the cheering  glow of the aurora borealis,or northern lights. It is not, therefore,  always dark, though when snow falls or the clouds block out the sky  the darkness becomes intense. At such times the picture is truly a  melancholy one.    To say that the light given by the aurora borealis does duty for  sunlight is not true. Magnificent spectacle as it presents, this  marvellous phenomenon produces no light of any real value, and only  occasionally for a few minutes does it illumine the landscape. Tales  of sleighing over the wastes of snow by the light of the aurora  borealis have no foundation in fact, for seldom, if ever, has it  sufficient power to obliterate the stars, and never does the moon  pale before it. On the other hand, it is certain that these northern  lights, streaming up into the heavens on every clear night of the long  winter, must bring feelings of pleasure to the inhabitants of the Polar  regions. The form, the intensity, and the colour of the light is ever  varying, and thus, in watching it, there is always expectancy. We in  England are accustomed to see these lights on autumn nights, but the  display is feeble in comparison with that of the Arctic winter.    No one knows for certain what the aurora borealis really is, and  even the most scientific people can tell you no more than that they  suppose it to be \"a phenomenon of electrical origin\"!            CHAPTER XV    LAPLANDERS AT HOME      Although Lapps are occasionally seen in charge of reindeer herds on  some of the southern mountain tracts of Norway, their real home is  in the Far North, not only of Norway, but also of Sweden, Finland,  and Russia, and the country which they inhabit is known as Lapland.    That portion of it which belongs to Norway covers only some 3,000 or  4,000 square miles, while the whole of the Land of the Lapps has an  area of something like 35,000 square miles. But statistics show that  in Norwegian Lapland there are a great many more inhabitants than  there are in Russian, Finnish, and Swedish Lapland put together;  and the people, whether they be under the rule of Russia, Sweden,  or Norway, are all of the same race--Asiatics and Mongols--totally  unlike Europeans in appearance.    In the first place, they are dark, and what we consider ugly, though  it is quite possible that in their eyes we ourselves are hideous. Then  they are short--a five-foot Lapp would be almost a giant--but what  they lack in stature they make up in sturdiness; for, although spare  of body, probably no men in the world can do a longer day's work,  or survive greater hardships. Dirty they are certainly, since they  never change their clothes and seldom comb their hair; yet, for all  that, they are perfectly healthy and happy.    They have gradually split up into three groups, known as Mountain  Lapps, Sea Lapps, and River Lapps, the first being nomads, or  wanderers, and the other two settlers, by the sea or river, who have  abandoned the original mode of life of their race.    Mountain Lapps are the most restless individuals it is possible to  imagine. Winter and summer they are always on the move, and three days  are seldom passed in one place. Time does not enslave them, for they do  not trouble about it. Routine is nothing to them: they eat and drink  when they feel inclined, and they sleep when a favourable opportunity  occurs. In such matters, as well as in many others, they resemble wild  animals. But in some respects they are methodical: they work by the  seasons, and in their wanderings take the same lines each year. In  the summer months they are down by the sea; during the remainder of  the year they are on the mountains, though at Christmas-time they  usually arrange to encamp somewhere in the vicinity of a church;  for Christmas is a great event in the lives of the Lapps, since they  profess Christianity, and if they are able to go to church at no  other time of the year, they make a point of doing so at this season.    To-day these people are law-abiding and peaceable, but they are a  strange mixture of good and bad. They are kind and hospitable, and of  a cheerful disposition; at the same time they can be cruel, cunning,  and selfish, while their love of money is no less than their love of  drink--when they can obtain it.    For one thing only does the Mountain Lapp live--his herd of  reindeer. They provide all his wants--food, clothing, and the  wherewithal to purchase luxuries. They are his wealth; his very  existence depends on them, and, in consequence, his mode of living  has to be accommodated to the habits of his reindeer. Whither-soever  they choose to graze, their owner has to follow; and he deems it  no hardship to pitch his rough tent on the snowy wastes in winter,  or even to sleep out under a rock, with the thermometer at seventy  degrees below zero. It is his life; from earliest childhood he has  known none other; he is content with it. And it is not only the men who  pass their lives thus; for the Lapp family is to some extent a united  one, and the women "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#13)"],[1,"upon the scene. The Mystery presents the course of sacred  story, derived from the Old and the New Testaments, together with  the lives of the saints from apostolic times to the days of St. Dominic  and St. Louis; it even includes, in an extended sense, subjects from  profane history--the siege of Orleans, the destruction of Troy--but  such subjects are of rare occurrence during the fifteenth century.    [Footnote 2: Derived from _ministerium_ (_metier_), but doubtless  often drawing to itself a sense suggested by the _mysteries_ of  religion.]    For a hundred years, from 1450 onwards, an unbounded enthusiasm for  the stage possessed the people, not of Paris merely, but of all France.  The _Confreres de la Passion_, needing a larger repertoire, found  in young ARNOUL GREBAN, bachelor in theology, an author whose vein  was copious. His _Passion_, written about the middle of the fifteenth  century, embraces the entire earthly life of Christ in its thirty-four  thousand verses, which required one hundred and fifty performers and  four crowded days for the delivery. Its presentation was an  unprecedented event in the history of the theatre. The work of Greban  was rehandled and enlarged by Jean Michel, and great was the triumph  when it was given at Angers in 1486. Greban was not to be outdone  either by his former self or by another dramatist; in collaboration  with his brother Simon, he composed the yet more enormous _Actes des  Apotres_, in sixty-two thousand lines, demanding the services of five  hundred performers. When presented at Bourges as late as 1536, the  happiness of the spectators was extended over no fewer than forty  days. The Mystery of the Old Testament, selecting whatever was  supposed to typify or foreshadow the coming of the Messiah, is only  less vast, and is not less incoherent. Taken together, the Mysteries  comprise over a million verses, and what remains is but a portion  of what was written.    Though the literary value of the Mysteries is slight, except in  occasional passages of natural feeling or just characterisation,  their historical importance was great; they met a national  demand--they constituted an animated and moving spectacle of  universal interest. A certain unity they possessed in the fact that  everything revolved around the central figure of Christ and the  central theme of man's salvation; but such unity is only to be  discovered in a broad and distant view. Near at hand the confusion  seems great. Their loose construction and unwieldy length  necessarily endangered their existence when a truer feeling for  literary art was developed. The solemnity of their matter gave rise  to a further danger; it demanded some relief, and that relief was  secured by the juxtaposition of comic scenes beside scenes of gravest  import. Such comedy was occasionally not without grace--a passage  of pastoral, a song, a naive piece of gaiety; but buffoonery or vulgar  riot was more to the taste of the populace. It was pushed to the  furthest limit, until in 1548 the Parlement of Paris thought fit to  interdict the performance of sacred dramas which had lost the sense  of reverence and even of common propriety. They had scandalised  serious Protestants; the Catholics declined to defend what was  indefensible; the humanists and lovers of classical art in  Renaissance days thought scorn of the rude mediaeval drama. Though  it died by violence, its existence could hardly have been prolonged  for many years. But in the days of its popularity the performance  of a mystery set a whole city in motion; carpenters, painters,  costumiers, machinists were busy in preparation; priests, scholars,  citizens rehearsed their parts; country folk crowded to every  hostelry and place of lodging. On the day preceding the first morning  of performance the personages, duly attired--Christians, Jews,  Saracens, kings, knights, apostles, priests--defiled through the  streets on their way to the cathedral to mass. The vast stage hard  by the church presented, with primitive properties, from right to  left, the succession of places--lake, mountain, manger, prison,  banquet-chamber--in which the action should be imagined; and from  one station to another the actors passed as the play proceeded. At  one end of the stage rose heaven, where God sat throned; at the other,  hell-mouth gaped, and the demons entered or emerged. Music aided the  action; the drama was tragedy, comedy, opera, pantomime in one. The  actors were amateurs from every class of society--clergy, scholars,  tradesmen, mechanics, occasionally members of the _noblesse_. In  Paris the Confraternity of the Passion had almost an exclusive right  to present these sacred plays; in the provinces associations were  formed to carry out the costly and elaborate performance. To the  _Confreres de la Passion_--bourgeois folk and artisans--belonged the  first theatre, and it was they who first presented plays at regular  intervals. From the Hospital of the Trinity, originally a shelter  for pilgrims, they migrated in 1539 to the Hotel de Flandres, and  thence in 1548 to the Hotel de Bourgogne. Their famous place of  performance passed in time into the hands of professional actors;  but it was not until 1676 that the Confrerie ceased to exist.    Comedy, unlike the serious drama, suffered no breach of continuity  during its long history. The jongleurs of the Middle Ages were the  immediate descendants of the Roman mimes and histrions; their  declamations, accompanied by gestures, at least tended towards the  dramatic form. Classical comedy was never wholly forgotten in the  schools; the liturgical drama and the sacred pieces developed from  it had an indirect influence as encouraging dramatic feeling, and  providing models which could be applied to other uses. The earliest  surviving _jeux_ are of Arras, the work of ADAM DE LA HALLE. In the  _Jeu d'Adam_ or _de la Feuillee_ (_c_. 1262) satirical studies of  real life mingle strangely with fairy fantasy; the poet himself,  lamenting his griefs of wedlock, his father, his friends are  humorously introduced; the fool and the physician play their  laughable parts; and the three fay ladies, for whom the citizens have  prepared a banquet under _la feuillee_, grant or refuse the wishes  of the mortal folk in the traditional manner of enchantresses amiable  or perverse. The _Jeu de Robin et Marlon_--first performed at Naples  in 1283--is a pastoral comic opera, with music, song, and dance; the  good Marion is loyal to her rustic lover, and puts his rival, her  cavalier admirer, to shame. These were happy inventions happily  executed; but they stand alone. It is not until we reach the fifteenth  century that mediaeval comedy, in various forms, attained its true  evolution.    The Moralities, of which sixty-five survive, dating, almost all, from  1450 to 1550, differed from the Mysteries in the fact that their  purpose was rather didactic than religious; as a rule they handled  neither historical nor legendary matter; they freely employed  allegorical personification after the fashion of the _Roman de la  Rose_. The general type is well exemplified in _Bien-Avise,  Mal-Avise_, a kind of dramatic Pilgrim's Progress, with two  pilgrims--one who is instructed in the better way by all the  personified powers which make for righteousness; the other finding  his companions on the primrose path, and arriving at the everlasting  bonfire. Certain Moralities attack a particular vice--gluttony or  blasphemy, or the dishonouring of parents. From satirising the social  vices of the time, the transition was easy to political satire or  invective. In the sixteenth century both the partisans of the  Reformation and the adherents to the traditional creed employed the  Morality as a medium for ecclesiastical polemics. Sometimes treating  of domestic manners and morals, it became a kind of bourgeois drama,  presenting the conditions under which character is formed. Sometimes  again it approached the farce: two lazy mendicants, one blind, the  other lame, fear that they may suffer a cure and lose their trade  through the efficacy of the relics of St. Martin; the halt, mounted  on the other's back, directs his fellow in their flight; by ill luck  they encounter the relic-bearers, and are restored in eye and limb;  the recovered cripple swears and rages; but the man born blind,  ravished by the wonders of the world, breaks forth in praise to God.  The higher Morality naturally selected types of character for satire  or commendation. It is easy to perceive how such a comic art as that  of Moliere lay in germ in this species of the mediaeval drama. At  a late period examples are found of the historical Morality. The  pathetic _l'Empereur qui tua son Neveu_ exhibits in its action and  its stormy emotion something of tragic power. The advent of the  pseudo-classical tragedy of the Pleiade checked the development of  this species. The very name \"Morality\" disappears from the theatre  after 1550.    The _sottie_, like the Morality, was a creation of the fifteenth  century. Whether it had its origin in a laicising of the irreverent  celebration of the Feast of Fools, or in that parade of fools which  sometimes preceded a Mystery, it was essentially a farce, but a farce  in which the performers, arrayed in motley, and wearing the long-eared  cap, distributed between them the several roles of human folly.  Associations of _sots_, known in Paris as _Enfants sans Souci_, known  in other cities by other names, presented the unwisdom or madness  of the world in parody. The _sottie_ at times rose from a mere  diversion to satire; like the Morality, it could readily adapt itself  to political criticism. The _Gens Nouveaux_, belonging perhaps to  the reign of Louis XI., mocks the hypocrisy of those sanguine  reformers who promise to create the world anew on a better model,  and yet, after all, have no higher inspiration than that old greed  for gold and"]]]
