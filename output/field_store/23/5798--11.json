On each  side are three flat-headed arches, those at the east end being closed,  while on each side of the piers adjoining the west end there are narrow  open arches. Corniced and battlemented screens fill these arches to  mid-height. The figure on the tomb is a modern restoration, very  elaborately clad in full pontificals, while the hands are clasped about  a heart, representing the _sursum corda_, or lifting up of the heart.  The chantry is kept in repair by Magdalen College, Oxford, which  Waynflete founded. Its situation, like that of the companion tomb of  Cardinal Beaufort, makes it very impressive. There is no altar now. At  the east end is a blank wall surmounted by three empty canopied niches,  while at the other are two open gratings.    In the corresponding position to the south is the #Chantry of Cardinal  Beaufort#, now kept in repair by the Dukes of Beaufort. In Britton's  time, as he tells us, there had fallen a \"horse-load of the pinnacles in  the canopy of Cardinal Beaufort's chantry.\" Owing, however, to the  extreme elaboration, the effect is hardly impaired by this loss. The  plan of the tomb is two groups of four clustered piers at each end,  supporting a mass of canopies, niches, and pinnacles, which \"bewilder  the sight and senses by their number and complexity,\" as Britton  quaintly says. The screen at the west end is closed, that at the east  end open. The vault displays some elaborate fan-tracery. The body of the  cardinal is presented in his scarlet official robes and the tasselled  and corded hat, and the serenity of his face suggests very little the  traditional portrait of him, as represented, for example, in  Shakespeare's \"Henry V.\" His death-bed moments, it is well known, have  been much misrepresented. The inscription originally on his tomb has  been destroyed, but Godwin quotes one sentence of it thus:--_Tribularer  si nescirem misericordias tuas_.    Against the north wall, not far from Waynflete's chantry, is an unknown  tomb with part of an effigy, to the east of which is the grave of one  William Symonds, \"Gentleman, of Winchester twice Maior and Alderman,\" as  his epitaph of 1616 relates. The last four lines of the inscription run  as follows:--        His Merrit doth Enherit Life and Fame,      For whilst this City stands Symonds his name      In alle men's harts shall never be forgotten,      For poores prayers rise when flesh lyes rotten.    Between the same chantry and the wall lies the tomb of Bishop de  Rupibus, while in the space between the chantries of Beaufort and  Waynflete lies the only ancient military effigy in the cathedral, a  genuine relic of the fourteenth century. It is commonly known as William  de Foix, and represents, in a slightly mutilated form, a knight in  surcoat and complete ringed armour of the thirteenth century. His legs  are crossed[5] and the feet rest on a crouching lion, while the head is  supported on two cushions which were formerly held up by angels. The  right hand grasps the sword hilt, and the pointed shield, one of the  earliest examples of a quartered shield, bears \"quarterly, in the first  and fourth, the arms of Bearn, two cows passant, gorged with collars and  bells; in the second and third, three garbs; over all a cross.\" On the  front edge of the slab Mr F.J. Baigent discovered the name Petrus  Gavston or Gauston twice encised, but to this \"scribbling\" Mr Weston S.  Walford, who has a note on this tomb in the fifteenth volume of the  _Archeological Journal_, does not attach much importance, for it may  merely record the engraver's conjecture as to the person here buried.  The body of Edward II.'s favourite, Piers, was moved from Oxford to  King's Langley in Hertfordshire two years after his execution, and  buried there on January 2, 1314, in the presence of the king. It is not  known to have been moved since. It seems probable that the effigy here  is that of the father of the Piers known to us, a Sir Arnold de  Gavaston, a record of whose interment at Winchester in May 1302 we  possess, with the additional fact that Edward I. sent money and two  pieces of cloth of gold to the funeral. Such respect would naturally be  paid to the father of Edward II.'s foster-brother. Mr Walford suggests  that the garbs on the shield are a canting allusion to the name Gabaston  or Gavaston, for the spelling varies very much--Gaveston, Gaverston, and  Gaberston being also found. The date of the tomb Mr Walford places  between the death of Arnold in 1302 and the murder of his son in 1312.  The tomb itself is adorned with five Decorated arches with the Gavaston  arms on the shield, together with those of England, of France, and of  Castile and Leon.       [5] \"Such figures as lie crosslegged are those who were in the         wars of the Holy Land, or vowed to go and were prevented\" (Sir         William Dugdale).    [Illustration: CARDINAL BEAUFORT'S CHANTRY.  _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    West of this are the tombs of Bishop Sumner and Prior Silkstede. The  latter's grave, according to Woodward, was found, when opened, to  contain the complete remains of a body robed in black serge, with the  \"funeral boots\" yet on the bones of the feet. The body seems to have  been removed hither from Silkstede's chapel in the south transept.    Next the western end of Beaufort's chantry is the tomb of William de  Basynge, prior of this church (_quondam Prior istius ecclesiae_), as his  inscription states, promising 145 days' indulgence to whoever prays for  his soul three years. He died in 1295.    On the south wall facing the same chantry is a marble monument of the  Royalist, Sir John Clobery; and near this is a large slab in the floor,  in memory of Baptist Levinz, Bishop of Sodor and Man, and prebendary of  Winchester, who died in 1692.    On the end wall of the ambulatory, to the left of the entrance to the  Chapel of the Guardian Angels, is a fine monument, somewhat mutilated,  to Ethelmar or Aymer de Valence, half-brother of Henry III., who was so  unpopular a bishop at Winchester. Only his heart is in the cathedral,  having been conveyed hither from Paris, where his body was buried. The  facts are commemorated by the following inscription on the presbytery  wall:--                    Corpus Ethelmari                Cuius Cor Nunc Tenet                Istud Saxum Parisiis                 Morte Datur Tumulo                  Obiit A.D. 1261.    When Winchester was attacked by the so-called religious zeal of the  Puritans, Ethelmar's heart was disturbed, as is recorded by a writer of  the period, who says that \"when the steps of the altar were levelling  with the rest of the ground one of the workmen accidentally struck his  mattock on this stone and broke it; underneath which was an urn wherein  the heart of this Ethelmar was, being enclosed in a golden cup, which  thing ... being conveyed to the ears of the committee-men they took the  cup for their own use, and ordered him to bury the heart in the north  isle, which he accordingly did.\" The heart, he goes on to say, was \"so  entire and uncorrupt\" that it was \"as fresh as if it had just been taken  from the body, and issued forth fresh drops of blood upon his hand. This  I had from the mouth of the workman himself, whom I believe.\" The slab  which once covered the heart shows, within the symbolic vesica, \"in a  trefoil canopy the half-length figure of the Bishop, mitred and in his  episcopal robes, his uplifted hands holding a heart, his pastoral staff  represented as resting on his left arm.\" Below are his arms and the  inscription in Lombardic letters, + _Ethelmarus. Tibi Cor Meum Dne._    [Illustration: THE LADY CHAPEL. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    [Illustration: DETAIL OF LADY CHAPEL.]    The #Lady Chapel#, due in part to De Lucy and in part to Priors Hunton  and Silkstede, is of rectangular shape, the easternmost portions being  added about 1524. It should be noticed that in De Lucy's work the  central aisle is but little higher than the laterals, which still have  their eastern walls, whereas the actual material of the Lady Chapel east  wall was erected by Hunton. The north and south walls exhibit De Lucy's  Early English arcades and lancets, while they become Perpendicular at  the eastern end, and the east window is of the same period. This large  seven-light window shows \"transom and tracery of a peculiar kind of  subordination, or rather inter-penetration of patterns, well worth a  careful study\" (Willis). The stone work of the interior is quite plain,  but a large portion of the wall space is concealed by some richly-carved  wooden panelling added by Bishop Fox. Seats, desks, and screen are also  of fine workmanship. Where the walls are not hidden by wood-work are the  very faint remains of some curious old mural paintings of the miracles  of the Virgin, executed under the direction of Prior Silkstede in 1489.  These frescoes are decidedly archaic, but they are extremely  interesting. Starting from the south side the nineteen pictures  represent:--    1. Miracle of an image of the Virgin bending its finger to prevent a  young man taking off a ring which he had placed on the image that it  might not be lost or injured while he played at ball. By this the young  man was won to monastic life.    2. Protection and honour conferred by the Virgin on an ignorant priest,  who knew and could sing only one mass, which was in honour of her.    3. Prior Silkstede kneeling before Virgin, saying: \"_Benedicta tu in  mulieribus_.\" Beneath is the following:--\"Prior Silkstede also caused  these polished stones, O Mary, to be ornamented at his expense.\"    4. Jewish boy, after receiving the Eucharist, thrown into a furnace by  his father, but delivered from the flames by the Virgin.    5. Famous portrait of the Virgin, carried in procession by Pope Gregory  to allay a fearful pestilence. During the procession the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#13)"],[1,"doesn't want  to bring any annoyance on her family, and that may be the reason she  doesn't tell much about herself. But as for that young officer's having  seen her, I believe Estelle when she says he is mistaken. Don't you?\"    \"I don't know what to believe,\" returned Ruth. \"But I'm not going to  worry over it.\"    \"And you won't tell her you don't believe she is what she seems to be?\"    \"Of course not, you little goose! But I'm going to keep my eyes open.  You know we may be able to give her some good advice. You and I, Alice,  don't meet with near the temptations that assail other girls in this  business, and it's because father is with us all the while. Now Estelle  isn't so fortunate; so I propose that we sort of look after her.\"    \"Oh, I'm very willing to do that.\"    \"And if we see anything that is likely to cause her trouble, we must  shield her from it. That is what I mean by sort of keeping watch over  her. At the same time, I believe that she is not altogether what she  seems. She is hiding something from us--even though we are trying to be  so kind to her. But she doesn't really mean to do it. She is just  afraid, I think.\"    \"And you really believe that lieutenant knows her?\"    \"He may. At least I think, from what you said, that he is honest in his  belief. But we will watch and wait. We must try to help Estelle in the  hour of trial.\"    \"Of course we will. Now hurry, for they are waiting for us.\"    \"Such a funny thing just happened to me!\" cried Estelle to the party of  young folks when they were in the automobile and on the way to the  village. \"I was mistaken for some one else.\"    \"What--again?\" asked Alice.    \"No, the same incident that you witnessed,\" and she related the episode  of the lieutenant as Alice had detailed it to Ruth.    \"That was queer,\" commented Hal Watson.    \"I should say so!\" exclaimed Russ.    \"Was he at all fresh?\" Paul asked, and his air was truculent.    \"Not in the least!\" Estelle hastened to assure him. \"He was honestly  mistaken about it, that was all,\" and she enlarged on the incident, and  seemed so genuinely amused by it that Alice nudged her sister as much as  to say:    \"See how much in error you are.\"    But Ruth only smiled, and Alice noticed that she regarded Estelle more  closely than ever.    The party made merry in the town, going into the \"Emporium,\" for  ice-cream sodas; and even the presence of Maurice Whitlow at the other  end of the counter, where he was imbibing something through a straw,  could not daunt Alice's high spirits. Whitlow smiled and smirked in the  direction of his acquaintances, but he received no invitation to join  them.    As Estelle was going out in the rear of the party, the extra player slid  up to her and asked:    \"Mayn't I have the pleasure of buying you some more cream?\"    \"You may not!\" exclaimed Estelle, not turning her head, and there were  snickers from the other patrons in the place. Maurice turned the shade  of his scarlet tie, and slid out a side door.    \"You're getting too popular,\" chided Alice to her friend. \"First it's  the young lieutenant, and now it's your former admirer.\"    \"I can dispense with the admiration of both!\"    \"Even the lieutenant?\" asked Ruth, meaningly.    \"Oh, he wasn't so bad,\" and Estelle either was really indifferent, or  she assumed indifference in a most finished manner that would have done  credit to a more experienced actress than she was.    \"What's the matter--are we late?\" asked Paul, as, on the way back to Oak  Farm, he saw Russ look at his watch and then speed up the car a bit.    \"Yes, a little. Mr. Pertell said he wanted to begin that skirmish scene  at eleven exactly, and it's ten minutes to that now. We can just about  make it. The sun will be in just the right position for making the film.  It's in a thicket you know, and the light isn't any too good. That's the  scene you girls are in,\" he went on.    \"Speed along,\" urged Paul. \"I've got to get into my uniform and make up  a bit.\"    There is very little \"make up\" done for moving pictures taken in the  open, and not as much done for studio work as there is on the regular  stage. The camera is sharper than any eye, and make-up shows very  plainly on the screen. Of course, eyes are often darkened and lips  rouged a bit to make them appear to better advantage. Even the men make  up a little but not much. For close-up views, though, where the faces  are more than life size, artistic make-up is very essential. The camera,  in this case, is a magnifying glass, and the most peach-blow complexion  would look coarse unless slightly powdered.    \"We'll be all right if we don't get a puncture,\" said Hal.    No sooner were these words out of his mouth than there came a hiss of  escaping air.    \"There she goes!\" cried Paul. \"Stop, Russ!\"    \"No, we haven't time. I'm going to keep on. It's better to get in on the  rims and cut a shoe to ribbons than to spoil the film.\"    They sped along in spite of the flat tire. And it was well they did, for  Mr. Pertell was anxiously waiting for his players when they arrived at  Oak Farm.    \"You cut it pretty fine,\" was his only comment. \"Don't do it again. Now  get ready for that skirmish scene.\"    This was one little incident in the big war play. In it Ruth and Alice  were to be shown driving along a country road. There was to be an alarm,  and a body of Confederate cavalry was to encounter one of the outposts  of the Union army. There was to be a skirmish and a fight, and the Union  men were to be driven off, leaving some dead and wounded. The girls,  though shocked, were to look after the wounded.    All was in readiness. The soldiers, some drawn from the newly-arrived  National Guards, were posted in their respective places. Lieutenant  Varley was to play the part of one of the wounded Unionists.    \"All ready--come on with the carriage!\" called Mr. Pertell to Ruth and  Alice, who were waiting out of range of the camera. They had rehearsed  the direction they were to take. \"Go on!\" called the director to Russ.  \"Camera!\"    The grinding of the film began, and Ruth and Alice acted their parts as  they drove along in the old-fashioned equipage. Suddenly, in front of  them the bushes crackled.    \"There they come!\" cried Ruth, pulling back the horses as called for in  the play. \"The soldiers!\"    But instead of a band of men in blue breaking out on the road, there  came a herd of cows, that rushed at the carriage, while the horses  reared up and began to back.    \"Stop the camera! Stop that! Cut that out!\" frantically cried Mr.  Pertell through his megaphone. \"Hold back those men!\" he added to his  assistant who had signaled for the Confederates to rush up.          CHAPTER XIII    FORGETFULNESS      Ruth and Alice for the moment were not quite certain whether or not this  was a part of the scene. Very often the director would spring some  unexpected effect for the sake of causing a natural surprise that would  register in the camera better than any simulated one.    But these were real cows, and they did not seem to have rehearsed their  parts very well, for they rushed here and there and surrounded the  carriage, to the no small terror of the horses, which Ruth had all she  could do to hold in.    \"Oh, what shall we do?\" cried Alice. \"I'm going to jump out!\"    \"You'll do nothing of the sort!\" exclaimed her sister. \"Sit where you  are! Do you want to be trampled on or pierced with those sharp horns,  Alice?\"    \"I certainly do not!\"    \"Then sit still! This must be a mistake.\"    It did not take much effort on Ruth's part to make Alice remain in the  carriage with all those cows about. For she had learned on Rocky Ranch  that while a crowd of steers will pay no attention to a person on a  horse, once let the same person dismount, and he may be trampled down.    These, of course, were not wild steers--Alice could see that. But she  thought the same rule, in a measure, might hold good.    More cows crashed through the bushes until the road was fairly blocked,  and then came another rush of many feet and the Union skirmish party  came galloping along. They had received no orders to hold back, and so  dashed up.    At the same moment a ragged boy with a long whip came rushing up.  Evidently, he was in charge of the cows, but when he saw the soldiers in  their uniforms, a look of fear spread over his face.    \"I didn't do nothin', Mister Captain! Honest I didn't!\" he yelled.  \"These is pap's cows, an' I'm drivin' 'em over to the man he sold 'em  to. I didn't do nothin'.\"    \"Nobody said you did!\" laughed Lieutenant Varley with a bow to Ruth and  Alice in the carriage. \"But why did you drive them in here to spoil the  picture?\"    \"I didn't know nothin' about no picture--honest I didn't! I took this  road because it was shorter. Don't shoot pap's cow-critters. I'll take  'em away.\"    \"Well, that's all we want you to do,\" said Mr. Pertell, coming up with a  grim smile. \"You nearly got yourself and your cow-critters in trouble,  my boy. Drive 'em back now, and we'll go on with the film. Did any of  'em get in, Russ?\" he asked.    \"Just a few, on the last inch or so of the reel. I can cut that out and  go on from there. Hold the carriage where it is, Ruth,\" he called.    \"All right,\" she answered, for she had now quieted the restive horses.    \"Don't be afraid, boy,\" said Alice to the lad. \"You won't be hurt.\"    \"And won't they hurt pap's cow-critters, neither?\"    \"No, indeed. It was all a mistake.\"    \"I--I didn't know there was no war goin' on,\" remarked the lad, as he  sent an intelligent dog he had with him after the straying animals. \"Me  an' pap we lives away over yonder on t'other side of the mountain. An'  we don't never hear no news. I was plum skeered when I seen all them  ossifers. Thought sure I was ketched, same as I've heard my grandpap  tell about bein' ketched in the army. He was a soldier with Sherman,  and I've heard him tell about capturin' cow-critters when they was on"]]]
