Harry had always attempted to conceal this feature, as far as  possible, by staining his eyelashes a deep black; but when he  looked up, the colour of his eyes could hardly fail to strike  anyone specially noticing them.    His constant exercise as a boy had given him great swiftness of  foot, and the year passed as a shikaree had added to his endurance  and speed and, divested of clothing as he was, he felt sure that  the horsemen, who were more than a mile in his rear when he first  caught sight of them, would not overtake him for some time. He was  running, as he knew, for life; for he was certain that, if caught,  Balloba would have him at once put to death as a spy. Although  hardy and of great endurance, the Mahratta horses, which were small  in size, were not accustomed to being put to the top of their speed  except for a short charge; and the five miles that they had  galloped already must have, to some extent, fatigued them.    After running at the top of his speed for about a mile, he looked  back. The party was still a long distance in his rear. Again he  pressed forward, but his exertions were telling upon him and,  before he had gone another half mile, the Mahrattas had approached  within little more than half that distance.    Far ahead he thought he could perceive a body of horsemen, but  these were nearly two miles away, and he would be overtaken before  they could reach him; therefore he turned suddenly off, and took to  one of the little banks dividing one irrigated field from another.  As soon as the horsemen reached the spot where he had left the  road, they too turned off; but Harry, who was now husbanding his  strength, saw a sudden confusion among them.    The little bank of earth on which he was running was but a foot  wide, and was softened by the water which soaked in from both  sides. It could bear his weight, well enough; but not that of a  mounted man. Only one or two had attempted to follow it, the others  had plunged into the field. Here their horses at once sank up to  the knees. Some endeavoured to force the animals on, others to  regain the road they had quitted. The two horsemen on the bank were  making better progress, but their horses' hoofs sank deeply in the  soft earth; and their pace, in spite of the exertions of the  riders, was but a slow one.    Harry turned when he came to the end of the field, and followed  another bank at right angles, and was therefore now running in the  right direction. He was more than keeping his lead from the  foremost of his pursuers Some of the others galloped along the  road, parallel to him, but ahead.    The horsemen he had first seen were now within a mile. On they  came, at the top of their speed; and the troopers on the road  halted, not knowing whether this body were friends or foes, while  those on the bank reined in their horses, and rode back to join  their comrades. Harry continued to run till he came to another bank  leading to the road and, following this, he arrived there just as  Sufder galloped up with his party, one of the troopers leading his  horse. They gave a shout of welcome, as he came up.    \"I thought it must be you,\" Sufder said, \"from the way you ran,  rather than from your attire. Shall we charge those fellows?\"    \"I think not,\" Harry said. \"In the first place Scindia has not, as  yet, declared war against Nana and Bajee; in the second, there may  be more men coming on behind; therefore it will be best to leave  them alone though, if they attack us, we shall, of course, defend  ourselves.\"    \"I think that is their intention, Puntojee. See, they have gathered  together! I suppose they daren't go back, and say that you have  escaped.\"    \"Give me either your sword or spear.\"    The latter was part of the regular equipment of the Mahratta  horsemen. Sufder handed him his sword and, as the pursuers advanced  towards them at a canter which speedily became a gallop, he took  his place by the side of Sufder and, the latter giving the word,  the band dashed forward to meet their opponents.    The combat was a short one. Sufder's followers were all picked men,  and were better mounted than Scindia's troopers. These made special  efforts to get at Harry, but the latter's skill with the sword  enabled him to free himself from his most pressing opponents.  Sufder laid about him stoutly and, his men seconding him well, half  their opponents were speedily struck to the ground; and the rest,  turning their horses, fled at full speed. Sufder's men would have  followed, but he shouted to them to draw rein.    \"Enough has been done, and well done,\" he said. \"If Scindia means  war, nothing will be said about this fight; but if he does not,  complaints will doubtless be laid against us, and it is better that  we should be able to say that we fought only in self defence; and  that, when the attack ceased, we allowed them to ride off  unmolested, though we might easily enough have slain the whole of  them.\"    On arriving at the grove where the troop had halted, Harry at once  resumed his own clothes; for although in his early days he had been  accustomed to be slightly clad, he felt ill at ease riding almost  naked. Here, too, he found Wasil, who had ridden with such speed  that his pony was too much exhausted for him to ride back with the  rest. He received his master with the greatest joy, for he had  feared he would be captured before leaving the camp.    They continued their journey to Jooneer, where they halted for the  night. Sufder went to his house, and Harry rode out to the farm.        Chapter 4: A British Resident.      As Harry drew rein at the farm Soyera ran out, followed by her  brother and Anundee, with cries of joy at his unexpected return. It  was nearly fifteen months since she had last seen him; though he  had, when opportunity offered, sent messages to her assuring her  that he was well, and hoped ere long to be able to come over to see  her.    \"I should scarce have known you,\" she said, \"in those fine clothes  of yours. You sent word that you were an officer in the Peishwa's  service; but I hardly thought that you could be so much changed.  You have grown a great deal, and are now much taller than Ramdass's  sons.\"    The worthy farmer and Anundee were also delighted to see him.    \"How long are you going to stay?\" the former asked.    \"Only till tomorrow, at daybreak. I have to ride forward, with all  haste, to Poona; for I have been on a mission for Nana Furnuwees.\"    \"Surely it is not so important that you cannot stay a few hours,  Puntojee?\"    \"It is of importance. You may have known that Nana has placed Bajee  Rao on the musnud, and he has installed himself as his minister;  thereby defeating the plans of Balloba and Scindia, who will  probably come along here with their whole force, in a day or two.\"    Late that evening, when the others had retired to bed, Soyera and  Harry had a long talk together.    \"Have you thought, Harry,\" she asked, after speaking for some time  about his doings and position at court, \"of joining your people  again? There is peace between the Peishwa's court and the English.  There is a British Resident at Poona and, as you have now gained a  certain rank there, you could go to him with a much better face  than if you had come direct from here, as a peasant. Then it would  probably have been supposed that you were an impostor. That you  were English, of course could be seen by your skin; but it might  have been thought that I had adopted some English child, and was  now trying to pass it off as the son of an officer.\"    \"I think, mother, that I had best continue, for some time, as I am.  You see I have, at present, nothing in common with the English  except their blood. Were another war to break out between the  Mahrattas and Bombay, I would at once declare myself to the  Resident here, and go down to Bombay but, even then, my position  would be a doubtful one and, unless I were to enlist in their army,  I do not see how I should maintain myself.    \"Moreover, you must remember that I have now a deep interest in  matters here. Nana Furnuwees has treated me with much kindness, and  placed his confidence in me. He has many enemies, as I have told  you. Scindia is about to advance against Poona, and it is probable  that he may succeed in driving Nana into exile, or imprisoning him  for life; and establishing Balloba, or some other person devoted to  his interest, as minister, in which case Scindia would be  absolutely supreme. Nothing would persuade me to desert Nana; who  has, for many years, alone withstood the ambition of Scindia's  party. I do not say, for a moment, that my aid would be of the  slightest use to him but, at any rate, he shall see that I am not  ungrateful for his kindness; and will be faithful to him in his  misfortunes, as he has been kind to me, when in power.\"    \"That is right,\" Soyera said. \"The cause of Nana is the cause of  all in this part of the Deccan; for we should be infinitely worse  off, were Scindia to lay hands on us. But there is an alternative,  by which you could at once remain faithful to Nana, and prepare  your way for joining the English, when you considered that the time  for doing so had arrived.\"    \"What is that, Soyera?\"    \"You might go to the English Resident, and tell him who you are,  and how you have been brought up. Say that, at present, you wish to  remain in the service of Nana; who has been a good friend to you,  and with whom your sympathies, like those of nearly all the  cultivators in the Peishwa's dominions, accord. Say that you hope,  when the time comes, to return to your countrymen; and that, in the  meantime, you will give him any information in your power as to  what is going on, subject only to your friendship for Nana. Thus,  by making yourself useful to the Resident, you may prepare your way  for joining your countrymen and, at the same time, be able to  remain with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#13)"],[1,"go on!\"  and Ulyth began to play, with her eyes alternately on the piano and on  the partners.    \"I suppose a fellow has to get used to 'the light fantastic' sometime,\"  remarked Oswald, as, after a successful five minutes' practice, he and  Rona sat down to rest.    \"Perhaps you'll have to dance with princesses at foreign Courts when  you're a successful ambassador,\" laughed Ulyth.    \"Is that what Oswald's going to be?\" asked Rona.    \"I'd have tried the Army or the Navy, but my wretched eyes cut me off  from both; so it's no use, worse luck!\" said Oswald. \"I should like to  get into the Diplomatic Service immensely though, if I could.\"    \"Why can't you? I should think you could do anything you really wanted.\"    \"Thanks for the compliment. But it's not so easy as it sounds. I wish I  had a friend at Court.\"    \"We don't know anybody in the Government,\" sighed Ulyth. \"Not a  solitary, single person. I've never even seen a member of Parliament,  except, of course, Lord Glyncraig sometimes at church; but then I've  never spoken to him. Stephanie had tea with him once. She doesn't let us  forget that.\"    \"I wish you'd had tea with him, and happened to mention particularly the  extreme fascinations and abilities of your elder brother,\" laughed  Oswald.    \"Could Lord Glyncraig be of any use to you?\" asked Rona. She had grown  suddenly thoughtful.    \"He could give me a nomination for the Diplomatic Service, and that  would be just the leg-up I want. But it's no use joking; I'm not likely  to get an introduction to him. I expect I shall have to go into business  after all.\"    \"I think when I was ten I must have been the most objectionable little  imp on the face of creation,\" said Rona slowly. \"I am ashamed of myself  now.\"    \"Why this access of penitence for bygone crimes?\"    \"Oh, nothing!\" replied the Cuckoo, flushing. \"I was only just thinking  of something. Shall we try that new step again? I'm rested now.\"    \"Yours to command, madam!\" returned Oswald, with a mock bow.           *       *       *       *       *    Rona's visit to the Stantons was a delightful series of new impressions.  She made her first acquaintance with the pantomime, and was alternately  amused and thrilled as the story of \"The Forty Thieves\" unfolded itself  upon the stage. Not even Peter watched with more round-eyed enthusiasm,  and Mr. Stanton declared it was worth taking her for the mere pleasure  of seeing her face when Ali Baba disappeared down a trap-door. As  everything in England was fresh to her, she was a most easy guest to  entertain, and she enjoyed every separate experience--from a visit to  the public library with Mr. Stanton to toffee-making in the nursery with  Peter and Dorothy.    Although it was a quiet Christmas in some respects, friends were  hospitable, and included her in the various little invitations which  were sent to Ulyth and Oswald; so her pretty dresses had a chance of  being aired. The great event to the young folk was the party which was  to be given at the Stantons' own house, and which was to be a kind of  finish to the holidays. The girls revelled in every detail of  preparation. They watched the carpet being taken up in the drawing-room,  the large articles of furniture removed, and the door taken off its  hinges. They sprinkled ball-room chalk on the boards of the floor, and  slid indefatigably until the polish satisfied Ulyth's critical taste.  They decorated the walls with flags and evergreens. They even offered  their services in the kitchen, but met with so cool a reception from the  busy cook that they did not venture to repeat the experiment, and  consoled themselves with helping to write the supper menus instead.    \"I think I've seen to everything,\" said Mrs. Stanton distractedly. \"The  flowers, and the fairy lamps, and the programmes, and those extra boxes  of crackers, and the chocolates, and the ring for the trifle. You've  seen about the music, Gerald?\"    \"Violin and piano,\" replied Mr. Stanton. \"I'm feeling a thorough-going  martyr. Giving even a simple children's hop means sitting in rooms  without doors and living on turkey drumsticks for a fortnight  afterwards!\"    \"Oh, we'll get the house straight again sooner than that! And you  needn't eat grilled turkey unless you like.\"    \"I don't appreciate parties.\"    \"We must amuse the young folks, and it isn't a grand affair. If the  children meet together they may as well dance as play games.\"    \"Daddikins, how nasty you are!\" exclaimed Ulyth, pursuing him to  administer chastisement in the shape of smacking kisses. \"You know  you're looking forward to it quite as much as we are.\"    \"That I deny _in toto_,\" groaned her father as he escaped to his  snuggery, only to find it arranged as a dressing-room.    Ulyth wore white for the great occasion, with her best Venetian beads;  and Rona had a palest sea-green gauzy voile, with fine stockings and  satin shoes to match. Dorothy was a bewitching little vision in pink,  and Peter a cherub in black velvet. Oswald, having reached the stage of  real gentleman's evening-dress, required the whole family to assist him  in the due arrangement of his tie, over which he was more than usually  particular. Ulyth even suspected him of having tried to shave, though he  denied the accusation fiercely.    It is always a solemn occasion waiting in the drawing-room listening for  the first peal of the bell announcing visitors. Mrs. Stanton was giving  a last touch to the flowers, Ulyth sat wielding her new fan (a Christmas  present), Oswald was buttoning his gloves. Dorothy, too excited to  stand still for a moment, flitted about like a pink fairy.    \"I'm to stop up half an hour later than Peter, Rona; do you hear that?\"  she chattered. \"Oh, I do hope the Prestons will arrive first of anybody!  I want to dance with Willie. Father let me have a cracker just now, and  it's got a whistle inside it. I wish I had a pocket. Where shall I put  it to keep it safe? Oh, I know--inside that vase!\"    As she spoke, Dorothy jumped lightly on to the seat of the cosy corner  that abutted on the fireplace, and reached upwards to drop her whistle  inside the ornament. In her excitement she slipped, tried to save  herself, lost her footing, and fell sideways over the curb on to the  hearth. Her thin, flimsy dress was within half an inch of the fire, but  at that instant Rona, who was standing by, clutched her and pulled her  forwards. It all happened in three seconds. She was safe before her  father had time to run across the room. The family stared aghast.    \"Whew! That was a near shave!\" gasped Oswald.    Dorothy, too much surprised and frightened to cry, was clinging to her  mother. Mr. Stanton, acting on the spur of the moment, rushed to the  telephone to try if any ironmonger's shop in the town was still open,  and could immediately send up a wire-gauze fire-protector. The  fireplaces in all the other rooms were well guarded, but in the  drawing-room the hearth was so wide, and the curb so high, that the  precaution had not been considered necessary.    \"It only shows how absolutely vital it is to leave no chance of an  accident,\" said Mr. Stanton, returning from the telephone. \"Matthews are  sending a boy up at once with a guard. If it hadn't been for Rona's  promptitude---- Oh, there's the bell! Oswald, fetch your mother a glass  of water.\"    Poor Mrs. Stanton looked very pale, but had recovered her composure  sufficiently to receive her young guests by the time they were ushered  into the drawing-room. Dorothy, child-like, forgot her fright in the  pleasure of welcoming her friends the Prestons, and everything went on  as if the accident had not occurred. Mr. Stanton, indeed, kept a close  watch all the evening, to see that guards were not pushed aside from the  fires, and Mrs. Stanton's eyes watched with more than usual solicitude a  certain little pink figure as it went dancing round the room. The  visitors knew nothing of the accident that had been avoided, and there  was no check on the mirth of the party. The guests were of all ages,  from Peter's kindergarten comrades to girls who were nearly grown-up,  but it was really all the jollier for the mixture. Tall and short danced  together with a happy disregard of inches, and even a thorough enjoyment  of the disparity. Rona spent a royal evening. Her host and hostess had  been kindness itself before, but to-night it seemed as if they conspired  together to give her the best of everything. She had her pick of  partners, the place of honour at supper, and--by most egregious  cheating--the ring somehow tumbled on to her plate out of the trifle.    \"I'm getting spoilt,\" she said to Oswald.    \"The mater's ready to kiss your boots,\" he returned. \"I never saw  anything so quick as the way you snatched old Dolly.\"    All good things come to an end some time, even holidays, and one morning  towards the end of January witnessed a taxi at the door, and various  bags and packages, labelled Llangarmon Junction, stowed inside.    \"I don't know how to thank you. I haven't any words,\" gulped Rona, as  she hugged \"Motherkins\" good-bye.    \"Do your best at school, and remember certain little things we talked  about,\" whispered Mrs. Stanton, kissing her. \"We shall expect to see you  here again.\"          CHAPTER VIII    The \"Stunt\"      The general verdict on Rona, when she arrived back at The Woodlands, was  that she was wonderfully improved.    \"It isn't only her dresses,\" said Gertrude Oliver, \"though she looks a  different girl in her new clothes; her whole style's altered. She used  to be so fearfully loud. She's really toned down in the most amazing  fashion. I couldn't have believed it possible.\"    \"I'm afraid it's only a veneer,\" declared Stephanie, with a slighting  little laugh. \"You'll find plenty of raw backwoods underneath, ready to  crop up when she's off her guard. You should have heard her this  morning.\"    \"And she broke an ink-bottle,\" added Beth"]]]
