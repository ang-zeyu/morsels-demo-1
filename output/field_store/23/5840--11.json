I didn't hear no one else.\"    \"I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard  good reports of the--Let me see, what is her name?\"    \"The Aurora, sir.\"    \"Ah!  She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in  the beam?\"    \"No, indeed.  She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. She's  been fresh painted, black with two red streaks.\"    \"Thanks.  I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith.  I am going  down the river; and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let  him know that you are uneasy.  A black funnel, you say?\"    \"No, sir.  Black with a white band.\"    \"Ah, of course.  It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs.  Smith.--There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson.  We shall take  it and cross the river.    \"The main thing with people of that sort,\" said Holmes, as we sat in  the sheets of the wherry, \"is never to let them think that their  information can be of the slightest importance to you.  If you do, they  will instantly shut up like an oyster.  If you listen to them under  protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\"    \"Our course now seems pretty clear,\" said I.    \"What would you do, then?\"    \"I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the  Aurora.\"    \"My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task.  She may have touched at  any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.  Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for  miles.  It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set  about it alone.\"    \"Employ the police, then.\"    \"No.  I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is  not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would  injure him professionally.  But I have a fancy for working it out  myself, now that we have gone so far.\"    \"Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\"    \"Worse and worse!  Our men would know that the chase was hot at their  heels, and they would be off out of the country.  As it is, they are  likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly  safe they will be in no hurry.  Jones's energy will be of use to us  there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily  press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong  scent.\"    \"What are we to do, then?\" I asked, as we landed near Millbank  Penitentiary.    \"Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour's  sleep.  It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again.  Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby!  We will keep Toby, for he may be of  use to us yet.\"    We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes  despatched his wire.  \"Whom do you think that is to?\" he asked, as we  resumed our journey.    \"I am sure I don't know.\"    \"You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force  whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\"    \"Well,\" said I, laughing.    \"This is just the case where they might be invaluable.  If they fail, I  have other resources; but I shall try them first.  That wire was to my  dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang  will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\"    It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a  strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was  limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body.  I had not the  professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look  at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem.  As far as the  death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and  could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers.  The treasure,  however, was a different matter.  That, or part of it, belonged  rightfully to Miss Morstan.  While there was a chance of recovering it  I was ready to devote my life to the one object.  True, if I found it  it would probably put her forever beyond my reach.  Yet it would be a  petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as  that.  If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold  stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.    A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up  wonderfully.  When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid  and Homes pouring out the coffee.    \"Here it is,\" said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.  \"The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up  between them.  But you have had enough of the case. Better have your  ham and eggs first.\"    I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed  \"Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\"    \"About twelve o'clock last night,\" said the Standard, \"Mr. Bartholomew  Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room  under circumstances which point to foul play.  As far as we can learn,  no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a  valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had  inherited from his father has been carried off.  The discovery was  first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the  house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.  By a singular  piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the  detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station,  and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm.  His  trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the  detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the  brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the  housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a  porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo.  It is quite certain that the  thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's  well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation  have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not  have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way  across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room  which communicated with that in which the body was found.  This fact,  which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was  no mere haphazard burglary.  The prompt and energetic action of the  officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such  occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind.  We cannot but think  that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our  detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more  effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\"    \"Isn't it gorgeous!\" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \"What  do you think of it?\"    \"I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for  the crime.\"    \"So do I.  I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happen to  have another of his attacks of energy.\"    At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs.  Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and  dismay.    \"By heaven, Holmes,\" I said, half rising, \"I believe that they are  really after us.\"    \"No, it's not quite so bad as that.  It is the unofficial force,--the  Baker Street irregulars.\"    As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the  stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and  ragged little street-Arabs.  There was some show of discipline among  them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in  line and stood facing us with expectant faces.  One of their number,  taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging  superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little  scarecrow.    \"Got your message, sir,\" said he, \"and brought 'em on sharp. Three bob  and a tanner for tickets.\"    \"Here you are,\" said Holmes, producing some silver.  \"In future they  can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me.  I cannot have the house  invaded in this way.  However, it is just as well that you should all  hear the instructions.  I want to find the whereabouts of a steam  launch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red  streaks, funnel black with a white band.  She is down the river  somewhere.  I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage  opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back.  You must divide it  out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly.  Let me know the  moment you have news.  Is that all clear?\"    \"Yes, guv'nor,\" said Wiggins.    \"The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.  Here's a day in advance.  Now off you go!\"  He handed them a shilling  each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment  later streaming down the street.    \"If the launch is above water they will find her,\" said Holmes, as he  rose from the table and lit his pipe.  \"They can go everywhere, see  everything, overhear every one.  I expect to hear before evening that  they have spotted her.  In the mean while, we can do nothing but await  results.  We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the  Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\"    \"Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say.  Are you going to bed,  Holmes?\"    \"No:  I am not tired.  I have a curious constitution.  I never remember  feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely.  I am  going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair  client has introduced us.  If ever man had an easy task, this of ours  ought to be.  Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man  must, I should think, be absolutely unique.\"    \"That other man again!\"    \"I have no wish to make a mystery of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#13)"],[1,"Stormberg Junction November 3, falling back to the  southward toward Sterkstrom and Queenstown; thus abandoning railroad  communication between East London, one of the sea bases, and the  western theatre of war toward Naauwport and De Aar. Naauwport had also  been quitted at about the same time, but the Boer grasp in that  central quarter was never as firm as it was to the eastward and  westward. General French was early established with his cavalry at  Hanover Road, midway on the line from Naauwport to De Aar, and his  activity, skilfully directed against the flanks of the enemy, imparted  to the latter a nervousness which the frontal attacks on the eastern  {p.108} line failed to produce. Naauwport was reoccupied by the  British November 19, and De Aar was never by them abandoned; but the  Boers on the 25th of November blew up a bridge on the line from  Naauwport _via_ Middelburg and Rosmead to Port Elizabeth, thereby  momentarily cutting out the line from this sea base also, as their  advance upon Stormberg had eliminated East London. They made also  strenuous efforts, at many points, to destroy the main road from  Kimberley south to Orange River, blowing up culverts and bridges, but  the damage effected was afterward found to be less than had been  expected, owing to the clumsiness of their methods; a fact which  probably indicates that their cause was supported mainly by a rural  population, and that few mechanics--townsfolk--were in their ranks.    There seems to have been no serious attempt to interrupt  communications south of the Orange River, important though it was to  do so. The British Corps, to the command of which Lord Methuen was  assigned, assembled at the Orange River Bridge without opposition or  difficulty, its concentration being effected {p.109} on the 19th of  November. The advance thence, in fact, began on the 21st, and on the  23rd was fought its first battle, that of Belmont.    It will be well here to summarize, map in hand, the character and  result of the Boers' operations in this western theatre, during the  priceless five weeks of opportunity secured to them by the  over-confidence, or the remissness, or the forbearance, of their  powerful enemy. The conditions differed from those in the eastern  scene of war--in Natal--because there the just anxiety of the  inhabitants, reflected in that of the colonial and Imperial  governments, had occasioned the concentration of by far the greatest  mass of available British troops.    The exposure of Natal in its more vital and strictly British interests  greatly exceeded that of Cape Colony, where, owing to the remoteness  of the seaboard, near which the British chiefly congregated, the first  of the Boer invasion would fall upon a population strongly sympathetic  with the cause of the enemy, though British in allegiance. Therefore  while this disloyalty was ominous and detrimental {p.110} to the  British cause as a whole, direct injury to British interests was less  immediately threatened. The Cape frontier, accordingly, was left  defenceless, as has been shown; and in a strictly military point of  view it was quite correct thus wholly to neglect one, rather than  weakly to divide between two.    The consequence was that in Natal occurred during ten days the severe  and nearly continuous fighting already narrated, with the result of  shutting up in Ladysmith, on the direct line of any further advance  contemplated by the Boers, a very strong British force; incapable,  doubtless, of taking the field against the vastly superior numbers  confronting it, but most capable, by numbers and position, of  embarrassing any onward movement of the enemy. This aspect of the case  has been too much neglected in the general apprehension.    The British in Ladysmith were doubtless an isolated and endangered  garrison, the relief of which constrained the movements of its friends  away from more proper objectives; but in the early days of the siege,  while {p.111} in the prime of the physical strength afterward drained  away by hunger, and up to the time that reinforcements had arrived to  bar in front the progress of the enemy, it was also to the latter what  Mantua in 1796 was to Bonaparte, and Genoa in 1800 was to the  Austrians prior to Marengo--a force which, if advance were attempted,  would be on the rear of the army, flanking the communications. To  secure these it would be necessary, before forward movement, either to  carry the place by assault, suitably prepared and executed, thus  sweeping it out of the way for good, or else to keep before it a  detachment of sufficient strength to check any effort seriously to  interrupt the communications. But this would be to divide the Boer  forces, to which doubtless Joubert did not feel his numbers adequate.  This was the important--the decisive--part played by Ladysmith in the  campaign.    Had the Boers' \"exclusiveness of purpose\"--to use Napoleon's happy  phrase--answered to the demands of their military situation, they  would have done for military reasons what their opponents were  compelled to do through {p.112} unpreparedness and considerations of  civil policy. They would have neglected the frontiers of Cape Colony,  and concentrated their effort against the organised force which  exceptionally favourable circumstances, that could not be expected  either to continue or to recur, had enabled them to isolate in Natal.    What effect the failure to do this produced in the latter colony will  be examined later. We have now to consider how the Boers, having  decided to follow two widely divergent plans of operations, utilised  the opportunity afforded them by the long period of weakness undergone  by their antagonists in the debatable ground, where the frontiers of  Cape Colony and the Orange Free State adjoin, along the banks of the  Orange River from Basutoland to Kimberley. Remote and detached  Mafeking, the news of whose deliverance comes as these lines are  writing, remains a romantic episode, a dramatic centre of interest,  from the heroic endurance and brilliant gallantry displayed by its  garrison; but, from the practical side, the action of friend and foe,  the fact of occupation and the conduct of {p.113} the siege, present  a military riddle not readily solved.    Noting the natural military line of the Orange River, the importance  of which in more military countries would be emphasized by  corresponding works of precaution, for defence and for movement, in  its vicinity, it will be observed that parallel to it, at a distance  of about fifty miles, within the borders of the colony, there is the  stretch of railway from Stormberg, _via_ Rosmead Junction and  Naauwport, to De Aar. Beyond the last-named point the line, now become  the main road, converges steadily and rapidly upon the border of the  Free State, within a dozen miles of which it continues from the point  where it crosses the Orange River until abreast the boundary between  the Free State and the Transvaal. Between Stormberg and De Aar this  line consists simply of the branches that there tie together the main  roads, through which the principal seaports--Cape Town, Port  Elizabeth, and East London--seek access to the interior. The  direction, alike of the main and branch roads, as well as the position  of the junctions, are doubtless determined {p.114} by local  considerations of topography and traffic.    Although constructed for commercial purposes, the line of rail from  Stormberg to De Aar has particular military value as an advanced base  of operations, from which to start, and upon which, for the initial  stages, to rest a campaign. It is central as regards the extremities  of the hostile frontier opposed to it; it is moderate in length; and,  from the rapidity of transfer from end to end afforded by the  railroad, it permits movements on one flank or the other to be  combined with comparative facility. Add to this the convergence upon  it of the several lines of supply from Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and  East London, and it is evident that the line would present particular  advantages for the assembling of a British army intending to invade  the Free State by the most probable, because most advantageous, route,  the direct highroad to Bloemfontein. It is, indeed, the key, the  central military position of this theatre of war; not geometrically,  by mere measurement of distance, but as the place where converge and  unite all the great communications from {p.115} the opposing bases of  operations, which at the first would be, for the Free State, the  Orange River, and for Great Britain, the line of seaports.    The distance from the frontier and the interposition of the mountain  range in the Steynsburg district would combine to make observation of  preliminary movements difficult to the enemy, except, indeed, by  information from the disaffected inhabitants who abounded. The secure  and undisturbed tenure of this line would therefore much facilitate  the British campaign, should it develop against the Free State;  consequently the first aim of the Boer commanders should have been to  hold, or if not able to hold, to destroy it effectually as regards  steam communication.    It is as yet impossible to say exactly what was the force of the Boers  on their western frontiers between the middle and the end of October.  Steevens, as above quoted, thought 12,000 at the earlier date. A more  likely reckoning seems to me to be 8,000, but it probably rose near  the higher figure before November, and must much have exceeded it by  the 1st of December, unless British {p.116} estimates are more wide  of the mark than is probable. The lowest maximum for the forces of the  two republics that I have seen was given by one of the Boer envoys  now[9] in the United States; viz., 38,000. Allowing 30,000 to Natal by  November 1, there is nothing immoderate in the supposition that there  were then from 10,000 to 12,000 on the line of the"]]]
