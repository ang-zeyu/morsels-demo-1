[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#13)"],[1,"laid down  the strict rule that all ministers should earn their living by manual  labour; and the result was that even if a minister wished to study  he could not find time to do so. For his work as a minister he never  received a penny. If a man among the Brethren entered the ministry, he  did so for the pure love of the work. He had no chance of becoming  rich. He was not allowed to engage in a business that brought in large  profits. If he earned any more in the sweat of his brow than he needed  to make ends meet, he was compelled to hand the surplus over to the  general funds of the Church; and if some one kindly left him some money,  that money was treated in the same way. He was to be as moderate as  possible in eating and drinking; he was to avoid all gaudy show in dress  and house; he was not to go to fairs and banquets; and, above all, he  was not to marry except with the consent and approval of the Elders. Of  marriage the Brethren had rather a poor opinion. They clung still to  the old Catholic view that it was less holy than celibacy. \"It is,\" they  said, \"a good thing if two people find that they cannot live continent  without it.\" If a minister married he was not regarded with favour; he  was supposed to have been guilty of a fleshly weakness; and it is rather  sarcastically recorded in the old \"Book of the Dead\" that in every  case in which a minister failed in his duties, or was convicted of  immorality, the culprit was a married man.    And yet, for all his humble style, the minister was held in honour.  As the solemn time of ordination drew near there were consultations of  ministers with closed doors, and days set apart for fasting and prayer  throughout the whole Church. His duties were many and various. He was  commonly spoken of, not as a priest, but as the \"servant\" of the  Church. He was not a priest in the Romish sense of the word. He had no  distinctive sacerdotal powers. He had no more power to consecrate the  Sacrament than any godly layman. Of priests as a separate class the  Brethren knew nothing. All true believers in Christ, said they, were  priests. We can see this from one of their regulations. As the times  were stormy, and persecution might break out at any moment, the Brethren  (at a Synod in 1504) laid down the rule that when their meetings at  Church were forbidden they should be held in private houses, and then,  if a minister was not available, any godly layman was authorised to  conduct the Holy Communion.[29] And thus the minister was simply a  useful \"servant.\" He gave instruction in Christian doctrine. He heard  confessions. He expelled sinners. He welcomed penitents. He administered  the Sacraments. He trained theological students. If he had the needful  gift, he preached; if not, he read printed sermons. He was not a ruler  lording it over the flock; he was rather a \"servant\" bound by rigid  rules. He was not allowed to select his own topics for sermons; he had  to preach from the Scripture lesson appointed for the day. He was bound  to visit every member of his congregation at least once a quarter; he  was bound to undertake any journey or mission, however dangerous, at the  command of the Elders; and he was bound, for a fairly obvious reason, to  take a companion with him when he called at the houses of the sick. If  he went alone he might practise as a doctor, and give dangerous medical  advice; and that, said the Brethren, was not his proper business. He was  not allowed to visit single women or widows. If he did, there might be  scandals about him, as there were about the Catholic priests. For  the spiritual needs of all unmarried women the Brethren made special  provision. They were visited by a special \"Committee of Women,\" and the  minister was not allowed to interfere.    The good man did not even possess a home of his own. Instead of living  in a private manse he occupied a set of rooms in a large building known  as the Brethren's House; and the minister, as the name implies, was  not the only Brother in it. \"As Eli had trained Samuel, as Elijah had  trained Elisha, as Christ had trained His disciples, as St. Paul trained  Timothy and Titus,\" so a minister of the Brethren had young men under  his charge. There, under the minister's eye, the candidates for service  in the Church were trained. Neither now nor at any period of their  history had the Bohemian Brethren any theological colleges. If a boy  desired to become a minister he entered the Brethren's House at an early  age, and was there taught a useful trade. Let us look at the inmates of  the House.    First in order, next to the Priest himself, were the Deacons. They  occupied a double position. They were in the first stage of priesthood,  and in the last stage of preparation for it. Their duties were manifold.  They supplied the out-preaching places. They repeated the pastor's  sermon to those who had not been able to attend the Sunday service.  They assisted at the Holy Communion in the distribution of the bread  and wine. They preached now and then in the village Church to give their  superior an opportunity for criticism and correction. They managed  the domestic affairs of the house. They acted as sacristans or  churchwardens. They assisted in the distribution of alms, and took their  share with the minister in manual labour; and then, in the intervals  between these trifling duties, they devoted their time to Bible study  and preparation for the ministry proper. No wonder they never became  very scholarly pundits; and no wonder that when they went off to preach  their sermons had first to be submitted to the head of the house for  approval.    Next to the Deacons came the Acoluths, young men or boys living in the  same building and preparing to be Deacons. They were trained by the  minister, very often from childhood upwards. They rang the bell and  lighted the candles in the Church, helped the Deacons in household  arrangements, and took turns in conducting the household worship.  Occasionally they were allowed to deliver a short address in the Church,  and the congregation \"listened with kindly forbearance.\" When they were  accepted by the Synod as Acoluths they generally received some Biblical  name, which was intended to express some feature in the character. It is  thus that we account for such names as Jacob Bilek and Amos Comenius.    Inside this busy industrial hive the rules were rigid. The whole place  was like a boarding-school or college. At the sound of a bell all rose,  and then came united prayer and Scripture reading; an hour later a  service, and then morning study. As the afternoon was not considered  a good time for brain work, the Brethren employed it in manual labour,  such as weaving, gardening and tailoring. In the evening there was  sacred music and singing. At meal times the Acoluths recited passages of  Scripture, or read discourses, or took part in theological discussions.    No one could leave the house without the pastor's permission, and  the pastor himself could not leave his parish without the Bishop's  permission. If he travelled at all he did so on official business, and  then he lodged at other Brethren's Houses, when the Acoluths washed his  feet and attended to his personal comforts.    The Brethren's rules struck deeper still. As the Brethren despised  University education, it is natural to draw the plain conclusion that  among them the common people were the most benighted and ignorant in the  land. The very opposite was the case. Among them the common people were  the most enlightened in the country. Of the Bohemian people, in those  days, there were few who could read or write; of the Brethren there was  scarcely one who could not. If the Brethren taught the people nothing  else, they at least taught them to read their native tongue; and their  object in this was to spread the knowledge of the Bible, and thus make  the people good Protestants. But in those days a man who could read was  regarded as a prodigy of learning. The result was widespread alarm. As  the report gained ground that among the Brethren the humblest people  could read as well as the priest, the good folk in Bohemia felt  compelled to concoct some explanation, and the only explanation they  could imagine was that the Brethren had the special assistance of the  devil.[30] If a man, said they, joined the ranks of the Brethren, the  devil immediately taught him the art of reading, and if, on the other  hand, he deserted the Brethren, the devil promptly robbed him of the  power, and reduced him again to a wholesome benighted condition. \"Is  it really true,\" said Baron Rosenberg to his dependant George Wolinsky,  \"that the devil teaches all who become Picards to read, and that if a  peasant leaves the Brethren he is able to read no longer?\"    In this instance, however, the devil was innocent. The real culprit was  Bishop Luke of Prague. Of all the services rendered by Luke to the cause  of popular education and moral and spiritual instruction, the greatest  was his publication of his \"Catechism for Children,\" commonly known  as \"The Children's Questions.\" It was a masterly and comprehensive  treatise. It was published first, of course, in the Bohemian language  {1502.}. It was published again in a German edition for the benefit of  the German members of the Church {1522.}. It was published again, with  some alterations, by a Lutheran at Magdeburg {1524.}. It was published  again, with more alterations, by another Lutheran, at Wittenberg  {1525.}. It was published again, in abridged form, at Zuerich, and was  recommended as a manual of instruction for the children at St. Gallen  {1527.}. And thus it exercised a profound influence on the whole course  of the Reformation, both in Germany and in Switzerland. For us, however,  the point of interest is its influence in Bohemia and Moravia. It was  not a book for the priests. It was a book for the fathers of families.

Against the wall of the church can be  seen the Norman arcading, showing there were cloisters from the first;  while the remains of the windows towards the cloister enclosure, to be  seen in the north and east alleys, tell us that they were rebuilt in the  Perpendicular period, probably in the last quarter of the fifteenth  century. Some corbels remain in the wall of the cathedral. The roof of  the cloister was therefore of wood; but there are remains of vaulting to  the west of the prior's door, so perhaps the western alley had a stone  roof. The first window to the west of the prior's door is original  Norman; all the rest (except one) were changed into three light windows,  apparently of the same date as those in the north aisle, but have lately  been reconstructed in the Norman style. This applies only to the windows  in the aisle; those in the triforium are of three lights, similar to  those removed from the aisle; and those in the clerestory are the  original Norman, just as on the north side.

[2] Introduction to Farren's \"Cathedral Cities of Ely and         Norwich.\"       [3] Population of Ely, 1891, was 6,646; of Wells, 5,899.       [4] Ely is almost universally called a city, upon the supposition         that the mere fact of its having a cathedral constitutes the town         a city. But since the Norman Conquest the dignity of a city has         always been conferred by grant, and no such grant is known to         have been made to Ely.       [5] An American visitor whom the writer was once conducting over         Peterborough Cathedral observed, \"This is a very large church for         so small a place.\" Ely is about a quarter of the size of         Peterborough in respect to population.       [6] But there is no indication that such a roof actually reached         the tower.       [7] Scott's Paper, read at Bissexcentenary Festival, 1873.

CATHARINE'S CHAPEL.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]          CHAPTER III.    THE CATHEDRAL: INTERIOR.      Entering the cathedral from the west, we have the full view of the  entire building, the vista being not broken, but relieved, by the open  screen. Before examining the nave itself, the visitor should inspect the  lower part of the west tower, beneath which he is standing. The curious  labyrinth worked in the pavement was there placed by Sir G. G. Scott, and  is believed to have been designed by him, and not copied from any  foreign example. The troubles that arose from the great weight of the  tower have been already described. We can here see the methods taken to  secure the stability of the structure.[1] Very massive Perpendicular  arches have been built beneath the lofty Norman ones; and all the four  great piers were surrounded with masonry at the same time. Both Bentham  and Miller give the date 1405-1406 for the beginning of this work. This  date is quite consistent with the character of the mouldings of the  arches. There was at one time a plaster ceiling just above these lower  arches.    Above the inner west door is a series of panels bearing coats of arms,  so much resembling the fronts of galleries built for the accommodation  of instrumental performers--which were known as \"Minstrels'  galleries\"--as to suggest the idea that the large room over the porch  was devoted to this purpose. The window above is an unfortunate  insertion, dating only from 1800; and this, as well as the stained glass  with which it is filled, could well be spared.    #The Western Transept# and #S. Catharine's Chapel.#--The Transitional  character of the late Norman work here is more marked than on the  outside of the west front. It will be noticed that the great arches of  the tower, though retaining all other characteristics of the period, are  pointed. There are two rows of mouldings, and in the spandrels above are  pointed ovals. Above the string-course are three stages: the lowest has  three sets of lofty trefoiled lancets, supported by double detached  shafts; above is a similar series, less lofty; at the top are three  large glazed windows. The painted ceiling of the tower was Mr. le  Strange's first experiment in painting at Ely. Some ancient decoration  in the vault of the south aisle of the nave had been brought to light  when he was on a visit at the Deanery, and this to some extent suggested  the thought of painting the flat roof of the tower. The subject is the  Creation. We see the right hand of the Lord; the Saviour holding a  globe, surrounded by the heavenly bodies of the fourth day of the  Creation; the Holy Dove; angels holding scrolls, with the Trisagion; and  all these are in circular designs, united by branches of foliage. A very  sad accident occurred during the early period of the restoration of the  tower in 1845, when Mr. Basevi, the architect, met his death by falling  from the upper floor of the scaffold which had been erected for the  work. He was buried in the cathedral, and a brass has been laid over his  grave. He was not in any way professionally connected with the work of  the restoration.    [Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING EAST.]    The very late appearance of the highly enriched work in the south part  of the western transept makes it probable that this part was completed  in quite the latest years of the twelfth century. The zigzag mouldings  to the two arches in the east are of extraordinary richness; one opens  to the south aisle, and one to S. Catharine's chapel. The whole of this  arm of the transept was at one time walled off, and the chapel itself  was destroyed. This has been rebuilt, under the advice and authority of  Professor Willis. The Woodford Trustees of the Theological College were  at the expense of providing the alabaster altar; and the chapel is now  used for the daily service of the members of that college, as well as  for early celebrations of Holy Communion. Although now known as S.  Catharine's chapel, it has never, strictly speaking, been so dedicated;  and the present Dean has pointed out that the name was given under a  misapprehension. The font in the transept was the gift of Canon Selwyn.  Its style is in keeping with the adjacent architecture. The north  portion of the western transept is entirely walled off. No documentary  evidence has been discovered to decide if it had been actually built.  The old tradition of the cathedral was that it had been finished by  Bishop Eustace at the beginning of the thirteenth century.    #The Nave.#--Originally of thirteen bays, but since the fall of the  central tower of twelve bays, the nave is a most complete and perfect  specimen of late Norman work. The naves of Ely and Peterborough are  conspicuously the best examples of the period in England. In most  respects they are very similar, and it would be difficult to pronounce  one superior to the other. In one point, indeed, the superiority is with  the Ely nave. There is not in it the slightest mixture of any  Transitional details. At Peterborough we can detect, towards the west,  some unmistakable evidences of the approaching change in style.    It is believed that the nave was completed in the time of Bishop  Riddell--that is, before 1173. This is probably somewhat earlier than  the nave at Peterborough; but both were obviously being built at the  same time for the greater part of the period of their erection. Both are  manifestly superior to Norwich, where (to mention only one point) the  excessive height of the triforium arches and the comparative low  elevation of the nave arches--so that the two arcades are almost of the  same dimensions--produce an unpleasing effect. But the work at Norwich  was earlier, perhaps by thirty years, than either of the others. It is  very difficult to obtain exact and authoritative measurements; but those  usually given supply the following comparison:--Norwich, 14 bays; length  of nave, 250 feet: Peterborough, 11 bays; length of nave, 228 feet: Ely,  12 bays; length of nave, 208 feet. From this it will be seen that before  the tower fell the naves of Ely and Peterborough were almost exactly of  the same length, while the former had two more bays than the latter.    The piers are of alternate design. In front of each an inner shaft runs  up to the roof. The string-course above the main arcade has the billet  moulding. All"]]]
