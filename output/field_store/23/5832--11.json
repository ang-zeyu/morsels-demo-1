[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#13)"],[1," a step away  from despotism. If we hold that double truth firmly, we have something  like a key to the rest of English history. A rather loose aristocracy  not only gained but often deserved the name of liberty. And the history  of the English can be most briefly summarized by taking the French motto  of \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,\" and noting that the English have  sincerely loved the first and lost the other two.    In the contemporary complication much could be urged both for the Crown  and the new and more national rally of the nobility. But it was a  complication, whereas a miracle is a plain matter that any man can  understand. The possibilities or impossibilities of St. Thomas Becket  were left a riddle for history; the white flame of his audacious  theocracy was frustrated, and his work cut short like a fairy tale left  untold. But his memory passed into the care of the common people, and  with them he was more active dead than alive--yes, even more busy. In  the next chapter we shall consider what was meant in the Middle Ages by  the common people, and how uncommon we should think it to-day. And in  the last chapter we have already seen how in the Crusading age the  strangest things grew homely, and men fed on travellers' tales when  there were no national newspapers. A many-coloured pageant of  martyrology on numberless walls and windows had familiarized the most  ignorant with alien cruelties in many climes; with a bishop flayed by  Danes or a virgin burned by Saracens, with one saint stoned by Jews and  another hewn in pieces by negroes. I cannot think it was a small matter  that among these images one of the most magnificent had met his death  but lately at the hands of an English monarch. There was at least  something akin to the primitive and epical romances of that period in  the tale of those two mighty friends, one of whom struck too hard and  slew the other. It may even have been so early as this that something  was judged in silence; and for the multitude rested on the Crown a  mysterious seal of insecurity like that of Cain, and of exile on the  English kings.          VIII    THE MEANING OF MERRY ENGLAND      The mental trick by which the first half of English history has been  wholly dwarfed and dehumanized is a very simple one. It consists in  telling only the story of the professional destroyers and then  complaining that the whole story is one of destruction. A king is at the  best a sort of crowned executioner; all government is an ugly necessity;  and if it was then uglier it was for the most part merely because it was  more difficult. What we call the Judges' circuits were first rather the  King's raids. For a time the criminal class was so strong that ordinary  civil government was conducted by a sort of civil war. When the social  enemy was caught at all he was killed or savagely maimed. The King could  not take Pentonville Prison about with him on wheels. I am far from  denying that there was a real element of cruelty in the Middle Ages; but  the point here is that it was concerned with one side of life, which is  cruel at the best; and that this involved more cruelty for the same  reason that it involved more courage. When we think of our ancestors as  the men who inflicted tortures, we ought sometimes to think of them as  the men who defied them. But the modern critic of mediaevalism commonly  looks only at these crooked shadows and not at the common daylight of  the Middle Ages. When he has got over his indignant astonishment at the  fact that fighters fought and that hangmen hanged, he assumes that any  other ideas there may have been were ineffectual and fruitless. He  despises the monk for avoiding the very same activities which he  despises the warrior for cultivating. And he insists that the arts of  war were sterile, without even admitting the possibility that the arts  of peace were productive. But the truth is that it is precisely in the  arts of peace, and in the type of production, that the Middle Ages stand  singular and unique. This is not eulogy but history; an informed man  must recognize this productive peculiarity even if he happens to hate  it. The melodramatic things currently called mediaeval are much older and  more universal; such as the sport of tournament or the use of torture.  The tournament was indeed a Christian and liberal advance on the  gladiatorial show, since the lords risked themselves and not merely  their slaves. Torture, so far from being peculiarly mediaeval, was copied  from pagan Rome and its most rationalist political science; and its  application to others besides slaves was really part of the slow  mediaeval extinction of slavery. Torture, indeed, is a logical thing  common in states innocent of fanaticism, as in the great agnostic empire  of China. What was really arresting and remarkable about the Middle  Ages, as the Spartan discipline was peculiar to Sparta, or the Russian  communes typical of Russia, was precisely its positive social scheme of  production, of the making, building and growing of all the good things  of life.    For the tale told in a book like this cannot really touch on mediaeval  England at all. The dynasties and the parliaments passed like a changing  cloud and across a stable and fruitful landscape. The institutions which  affected the masses can be compared to corn or fruit trees in one  practical sense at least, that they grew upwards from below. There may  have been better societies, and assuredly we have not to look far for  worse; but it is doubtful if there was ever so spontaneous a society. We  cannot do justice, for instance, to the local government of that epoch,  even where it was very faulty and fragmentary, by any comparisons with  the plans of local government laid down to-day. Modern local government  always comes from above; it is at best granted; it is more often merely  imposed. The modern English oligarchy, the modern German Empire, are  necessarily more efficient in making municipalities upon a plan, or  rather a pattern. The mediaevals not only had self-government, but their  self-government was self-made. They did indeed, as the central powers of  the national monarchies grew stronger, seek and procure the stamp of  state approval; but it was approval of a popular fact already in  existence. Men banded together in guilds and parishes long before Local  Government Acts were dreamed of. Like charity, which was worked in the  same way, their Home Rule began at home. The reactions of recent  centuries have left most educated men bankrupt of the corporate  imagination required even to imagine this. They only think of a mob as a  thing that breaks things--even if they admit it is right to break them.  But the mob made these things. An artist mocked as many-headed, an  artist with many eyes and hands, created these masterpieces. And if the  modern sceptic, in his detestation of the democratic ideal, complains of  my calling them masterpieces, a simple answer will for the moment serve.  It is enough to reply that the very word \"masterpiece\" is borrowed from  the terminology of the mediaeval craftsmen. But such points in the Guild  System can be considered a little later; here we are only concerned with  the quite spontaneous springing upwards of all these social  institutions, such as they were. They rose in the streets like a silent  rebellion; like a still and statuesque riot. In modern constitutional  countries there are practically no political institutions thus given by  the people; all are received by the people. There is only one thing that  stands in our midst, attenuated and threatened, but enthroned in some  power like a ghost of the Middle Ages: the Trades Unions.    In agriculture, what had happened to the land was like a universal  landslide. But by a prodigy beyond the catastrophes of geology it may be  said that the land had slid uphill. Rural civilization was on a wholly  new and much higher level; yet there was no great social convulsions or  apparently even great social campaigns to explain it. It is possibly a  solitary instance in history of men thus falling upwards; at least of  outcasts falling on their feet or vagrants straying into the promised  land. Such a thing could not be and was not a mere accident; yet, if we  go by conscious political plans, it was something like a miracle. There  had appeared, like a subterranean race cast up to the sun, something  unknown to the august civilization of the Roman Empire--a peasantry. At  the beginning of the Dark Ages the great pagan cosmopolitan society now  grown Christian was as much a slave state as old South Carolina. By the  fourteenth century it was almost as much a state of peasant proprietors  as modern France. No laws had been passed against slavery; no dogmas  even had condemned it by definition; no war had been waged against it,  no new race or ruling caste had repudiated it; but it was gone. This  startling and silent transformation is perhaps the best measure of the  pressure of popular life in the Middle Ages, of how fast it was making  new things in its spiritual factory. Like everything else in the  mediaeval revolution, from its cathedrals to its ballads, it was as  anonymous as it was enormous. It is admitted that the conscious and  active emancipators everywhere were the parish priests and the  religious brotherhoods; but no name among them has survived and no man  of them has reaped his reward in this world. Countless Clarksons and  innumerable Wilberforces, without political machinery or public fame,  worked at death-beds and confessionals in all the villages of Europe;  and the vast system of slavery vanished. It was probably the widest work  ever done which was voluntary on both sides; and the Middle Ages was in  this and other things the age of volunteers. It is possible enough to  state roughly the stages through which the thing passed; but such a  statement does not explain the loosening of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#13)"],[1,"slowly, in unison, below us,  over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and  passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose  watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed  intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me  a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of  lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority--my  accomplishments and my function--in her patience under my pain. She  offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch's  broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large  clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time  that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of  what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous  hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I had gone  down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated  need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more  resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of  representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the  real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him  into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. As soon as I  appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight  as possible; on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him,  through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily  hovered for him, along the lobby where I had listened and trembled, and  so to his forsaken room.    Not a sound, on the way, had passed between us, and I had wondered--oh,  HOW I had wondered!--if he were groping about in his little mind for  something plausible and not too grotesque. It would tax his invention,  certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a curious  thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He couldn't  play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get out of it?  There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this question an  equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce _I_ should. I was confronted at  last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now to sounding my  own horrid note. I remember in fact that as we pushed into his little  chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and the window,  uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear that there was no  need of striking a match--I remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon  the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that he must know how he  really, as they say, \"had\" me. He could do what he liked, with all his  cleverness to help him, so long as I should continue to defer to the  old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who  minister to superstitions and fears. He \"had\" me indeed, and in a cleft  stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would consent that I should go  unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture, I were the first to  introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire? No, no: it  was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely  less so to attempt to suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in  the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. I was of course thoroughly  kind and merciful; never, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders  hands of such tenderness as those with which, while I rested against the  bed, I held him there well under fire. I had no alternative but, in form  at least, to put it to him.    \"You must tell me now--and all the truth. What did you go out for? What  were you doing there?\"    I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes,  and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. \"If I  tell you why, will you understand?\" My heart, at this, leaped into my  mouth. WOULD he tell me why? I found no sound on my lips to press it,  and I was aware of replying only with a vague, repeated, grimacing nod.  He was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he stood  there more than ever a little fairy prince. It was his brightness indeed  that gave me a respite. Would it be so great if he were really going to  tell me? \"Well,\" he said at last, \"just exactly in order that you should  do this.\"    \"Do what?\"    \"Think me--for a change--BAD!\" I shall never forget the sweetness and  gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he  bent forward and kissed me. It was practically the end of everything.  I met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a minute in my  arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given exactly the  account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and it  was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, as I  presently glanced about the room, I could say--    \"Then you didn't undress at all?\"    He fairly glittered in the gloom. \"Not at all. I sat up and read.\"    \"And when did you go down?\"    \"At midnight. When I'm bad I AM bad!\"    \"I see, I see--it's charming. But how could you be sure I would know  it?\"    \"Oh, I arranged that with Flora.\" His answers rang out with a readiness!  \"She was to get up and look out.\"    \"Which is what she did do.\" It was I who fell into the trap!    \"So she disturbed you, and, to see what she was looking at, you also  looked--you saw.\"    \"While you,\" I concurred, \"caught your death in the night air!\"    He literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly  to assent. \"How otherwise should I have been bad enough?\" he asked.  Then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview closed on my  recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his joke, he had  been able to draw upon.          XII      The particular impression I had received proved in the morning light,  I repeat, not quite successfully presentable to Mrs. Grose, though I  reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made  before we separated. \"It all lies in half a dozen words,\" I said to her,  \"words that really settle the matter. 'Think, you know, what I MIGHT  do!' He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down to  the ground what he 'might' do. That's what he gave them a taste of at  school.\"    \"Lord, you do change!\" cried my friend.    \"I don't change--I simply make it out. The four, depend upon it,  perpetually meet. If on either of these last nights you had been with  either child, you would clearly have understood. The more I've watched  and waited the more I've felt that if there were nothing else to make it  sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. NEVER, by a  slip of the tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of their old  friends, any more than Miles has alluded to his expulsion. Oh, yes,  we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us there to  their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale  they're steeped in their vision of the dead restored. He's not reading  to her,\" I declared; \"they're talking of THEM--they're talking horrors!  I go on, I know, as if I were crazy; and it's a wonder I'm not. What  I've seen would have made YOU so; but it has only made me more lucid,  made me get hold of still other things.\"    My lucidity must have seemed awful, but the charming creatures who were  victims of it, passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness,  gave my colleague something to hold on by; and I felt how tight she held  as, without stirring in the breath of my passion, she covered them still  with her eyes. \"Of what other things have you got hold?\"    \"Why, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at  bottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their more  than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It's a game,\"  I went on; \"it's a policy and a fraud!\"    \"On the part of little darlings--?\"    \"As yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!\" The very act of  bringing it out really helped me to trace it--follow it all up and piece  it all together. \"They haven't been good--they've only been absent. It  has been easy to live with them, because they're simply leading a  life of their own. They're not mine--they're not ours. They're his and  they're hers!\"    \"Quint's and that woman's?\"    \"Quint's and that woman's. They want to get to them.\"    Oh, how, at this, poor Mrs. Grose appeared to study them! \"But for  what?\"    \"For the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair put  into them. And to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the work of  demons, is what brings the others back.\"    \"Laws!\" said my friend under her breath. The exclamation was homely, but  it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the bad  time--for there had been a worse even than this!--must have occurred.  There could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent  of her experience to whatever depth of depravity I found credible in  our brace of scoundrels. It was in obvious submission of memory that she  brought out after a moment: \"They WERE rascals! But what can they now  do?\" she pursued.    \"Do?\" I echoed so loud that Miles and Flora, as they passed at their  distance, paused an instant in their walk and looked at us. \"Don't  they do enough?\" I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having  smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. We  were held by it a minute; then I answered: \"They can destroy them!\" At  this my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launched was a silent  one, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. \"They don't know,  as yet, quite how--but they're trying hard. They're seen only across,  as it were, and beyond--in strange places and on high places, the top of"]]]
