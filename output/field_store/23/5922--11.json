Interjectory this journal must be, even my sketches are running into  meaningless strokes with so many subjects following one on the top of  the other. In the pauses that follow the passing of troops and  gun-firing, the crowds in the streets below our hotel watch snake  charmers, jugglers, and monkey trainers who play up to us at our  balconies.    What a delight!--there they are, all the figures we knew as dusty  coloured models as children, now all alive and moving and real. The  snake charmer, a north countryman, I think, sits on his heels on the  road and grins up at us and chatters softly and continuously, holding up  his hands full of emerald green slow moving snakes; a crowd of holiday  townspeople stand round him at a little distance and watch closely. He  stows the green snakes away into a basket, and his hands are as lithe as  his snakes but quicker, then pipes to nasty cobras, the colour of the  dusty road; they raise their heads and blow out their hoods and sway to  and fro as he plays. Then the mongoose man shows how his beast eats a  snake's head--no trick about this! And always between the turns of the  performances the performers look up and show their white teeth and talk  softly to us, but we can't hear what they say the windows are so high  up. Then bang go the guns again, and we shut our blinds and try to read  of the show of the day, the opening of Princes Street, when the Prince  drove through \"millions of happy and prettily dressed subjects.\" As we  read there comes a knock and a message with an invitation card to see  the Prince open a museum, and we read on; another knock comes just as  I'd begun to draw the Prince as we saw him last night in a swirl of  dust, outriders, and cavalry, blurred in night and dust and heat--it is  another card! To meet their Royal Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of  Wales to-night at Government House! Surely this is the veritable land of  the tales of the Arabian Nights! It comes as a shock to live all your  life in your own country and never to see the shadow of Royalty, then  suddenly to be asked twice in one day to view them as they pass--I am  quite overcome--It will be a novel experience, and won't it be warm! It  means top hat, frock coat and an extra high collar for the afternoon,  and in the evening a hard, hot, stiff shirt and black hot clothes, and a  crush and the thermometer at pucca hot-weather temperature, and damp at  that, but who cares, if we actually see Royalty--twice in one day!       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    I am determined not to go out to-day, not on any account. I will sit in  this tower room of this palace and write and draw, and will shut these  jalousies that open west and south and north-east, and offer  distracting views, and I will contemplate the distempered walls in the  shade till I have recalled all I saw yesterday. If I go to the window,  or outside, there will be too many new things to see. I maintain that  for one day of new sights, a day is needed to arrange them in the  tablets of memory.... But is it possible I saw all these things in one  day! From a tiny wedding in the Kirk in the morning to the Royal  Reception at Government House at night; from dawn till late night one  splendid line of pictures of Oriental and Occidental pageantry, of which  I have heard and read of so much and realised so little compared with  reality.    [Illustration]    We started the day with a wedding of a lady we knew on board, to a young  Scottish officer, the day after her arrival. We directed our \"boy\" to  tell our driver to go to the Free Church. But apparently neither of  these benighted heathens could distinguish between the \"Free\" and the  \"Wee Free,\" or the \"U. P.\" or the \"Established\" and took us to the  English Church. We had such a hunt for the particular branch of the  Church of Scotland. It was quite a small kirk, and our numbers were in  proportion. We arrived a little hot and angry at being so misled, but  the best man, a brother officer of the bridegroom, had not turned up, so  we waited a little and chatted and joked a little, and felt in our  hearts we would wish to see the bride and bridegroom's friends and  relations about them. The best man came soon, and the bridegroom's  colonel, and made an audience of four, not counting the minister; and  the somewhat lonely pair stood before him, with the punkah above them,  and the sun streamed through latticed windows and a modest bit of  stained glass, and they were joined for better and no worse I am sure.  Then the minister opened a little paste board box someone had sent from  home, and out came a little rice, and we four got a little each and  threw it very carefully, two or three grains at a time so as not to  miss. The bride had a dainty sprig of white heather in a brooch of a  lion's collar bone, and was dressed in white and had a very becoming  rose from home, and the sea, on her cheeks. As we prayed I made a sketch  of them for her sister at home. Then they and the witnesses signed their  names, and where their hands and wrists touched the vestry table there  was a tiny puddle, and yet this is what they call \"cold weather\" here!    We met the bride and bridegroom later at lunch, and we drank to each  other's health in pegs of lemon squash after the latest fashion East of  Suez.        \"It was a wee, wee waddin'      In a far, far toon,\"    and it's far awayness from friends and relatives and their own country  was rather pathetic, even though the pair looked so handsome and happy.    We drove back more leisurely and marvelled at the innumerable lovely  groups in streets and by-ways, the flicker of light through banyan trees  on white-robed figures, the little carts with big wooden wheels and  small oxen and sharp big shadows, and we stopped to watch a splendid  group of men washing clothes, a dozen or more naked brown statues  against a white low wall, water splashing over them and round them,  flecks of sun and shadows coming through the leaves--I suppose these  were natives from the north as they had good legs. I must try and put  that down this afternoon if I can, and bring in the hedge of convolvulus  with lilac blooms behind and the hoody crows dancing round; then past  lines of pretty horses and tents and officers and ladies at lunch. At  our lunch at the Taj we bade good-bye to five friends, R. and D. for  Bangalore, Mrs D. C. for the north, and our newly-married pair for  Baroda. So G. and I and Mr and Mrs H. remain out of our table on board  ship; the H.'s stay for a time at the Taj and tell us so much about  Bombay, its people, and their ways, that a guide book would feel very  dry reading.    By the afternoon we have received I think five invitations on yellow  cards to various royal functions! Now indeed we are in the marvellous  East, in the land to which Scot and Irish should travel to see their  prince or king. So you, my dear friends, artists and professional men,  who have chosen to live as I have done, in or near the capital of your  native land, and whose most thrilling pageant in the whole year is the  line of our worthy bailies and the provost in hired coaches going up the  High Street to open a meeting of ministers, if you would experience the  feeling that stirred the blood of your ancestors so hotly, the feeling  of personal loyalty to prince or king, the sense that is becoming as  dormant as the muscles behind our ears, all you have to do is to leave  your native shores and your professional duties, and home ties, and  travel to some outlying part of the Empire; say to Bombay--there and  back will cost you about _L_200 by P. & O., but you will realise then  that the old nerves may still vibrate. You, my friends, who can't  afford this luxury, you must just stay at home and be as loyal as you  can under the circumstances, and try not to think of our departed  glories, and Home Rule, or Separation--and you can read, about these  yellow tickets to royal shows and such far off things, in traveller's  tales.    The first of these functions was the laying of the foundation of a  museum of science and art; it sounds prosaic, but it was a pageant of  pageantry and pucca tomasha too; the greater part, I daresay, just the  ordinary gorgeousness of this country, fevered with stirring loyalty.  The ceremony was in the centre of an open space of grass, surrounded by  town buildings of half Oriental and half Western design, and blocks of  private flats, each flat with a deep verandah and all bedecked with  flags, and gay figures on the roofs and in the verandahs. In the centre  of the grass were shears with a stone hanging from them on block and  tackle. To our left was a raised dais with red and yellow striped tent  roof supported on pillars topped with spears and flags and the three  golden feathers of the Prince of Wales. In front of the circle of chairs  opposite this and to our right sat the Indian princes; they had rather  handsome brown faces and fat figures, and wore coats of delicate silks  and satins, patent leather shoes and loose socks, big silver bangles and  anklets; their turbans and swords sparkled with jewels, and the air in  their neighbourhood was laden with the scents of Araby.    Behind us sat the Parsees and their women-folk, soberly clad in European  dress; they are intelligent looking people with pleasant cheery manners,  I would like to see more of them. Their fire-worship interests me, for  it was till lately our own religion, and I even to-day know of an old  lady in an out-of-the-way corner of our West Highlands who, till quite  recently, went through various genuflexions every morning--old forms of  fire-worship--as the sun rose; and in the Outer Isles we have still  many remains of our fore-fathers' worship woven into the untruthful  jingling rhymes of the monks.[5]    [5] See \"Carmi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#13)"],[1,"res.'  'The deil a bit,' quo I; 'that I deny positively. H'mh! to speak o' a  lass o' my age being ruined and undone! I never had muckle except what  was within a good jerkin, an' let the thief ruin me there wha can.    \"Do you remember aught else that your mistress said on the occasion?  Did you hear her blame any person?\"    \"O, she made a gread deal o' grumphing an' groaning about the  misfortune, as she ca'd it, an' I think she said it was a part o' the  ruin, wrought by the Ringans, or some sic name. 'They'll hae't a'!  They'll hae't a'!' cried she, wringing her hands; 'a'! they'll hae' a',  an' hell wi't, an' they'll get them baith.' 'Aweel, that's aye some  satisfaction,' quo I.\"    \"Whom did she mean by the Ringans, do you know?\"    \"I fancy they are some creatures that she has dreamed about, for I  think there canna be as ill folks living as she ca's them.\"    \"Did you never hear say that the prisoner at the bar there, Mrs.  Calvert, or Bell Calvert, was the robber of her house; or that she was  one of the Ringans?\"    \"Never. Somebody tauld her lately that ane Bell Calvert robbed her  house, but she disna believe it. Neither do I.\"    \"What reasons have you for doubting it?\"    \"Because it was nae woman's fingers that broke up the bolts an' the  locks that were torn open that night.\"    \"Very pertinent, Bessy. Come then within the bar, and look, at these  articles on the table. Did you ever see these silver spoons before?\"    \"I hae seen some very like them, and whaever has seen siller spoons has  done the same.\"    \"Can you swear you never saw them before?\"    \"Na, na, I wadna swear to ony siller spoons that ever war made, unless  I had put a private mark on them wi' my ain hand, an' that's what I  never did to ane.\"    \"See, they are all marked with a C.\"    \"Sae are a' the spoons in Argyle, an' the half o' them in Edinburgh I  think. A C is a very common letter, an' so are a' the names that begin  wi't. Lay them by, lay them by, an' gie the poor woman her spoons  again. They are marked wi' her ain name, an' I hae little doubt they  are hers, an' that she has seen better days.\"    \"Ah, God bless her heart!\" sighed the prisoner; and that blessing was  echoed in the breathings of many a feeling breast.    \"Did you ever see this gown before, think you?\"    \"I hae seen ane very like it.\"    \"Could you not swear that gown was your mistress's once?\"    \"No, unless I saw her hae't on, an' kend that she had paid for't. I am  very scrupulous about an oath. Like is an ill mark. Sae ill indeed that  I wad hardly swear to anything.\"    \"But you say that gown is very like one your mistress used to wear.\"    \"I never said sic a thing. It is like one I hae seen her hae out airing  on the hay raip i' the back green. It is very like ane I hae seen Mrs.  Butler in the Grass Market wearing too: I rather think it is the same.  Bless you, sir, I wadna swear to my ain forefinger, if it had been as  lang out o' my sight an', brought in an' laid on that table.\"    \"Perhaps you are not aware, girl, that this scrupulousness of yours is  likely to thwart the purposes of justice, and bereave your mistress of  property to the amount of a thousand merks.\" (From the Judge.)    \"I canna help that, my lord: that's her look-out. For my part, I am  resolved to keep a clear conscience, till I be married, at any rate.\"    \"Look over these things and see if there is any one article among them  which you can fix on as the property of your mistress.\"    \"No ane o' them, sir, no ane o' them. An oath is an awfu' thing,  especially when it is for life or death. Gie the poor woman her things  again, an' let my mistress pick up the next she finds: that's my  advice.\"    When Mrs. Logan came into the box, the prisoner groaned and laid down  her head. But how she was astonished when she heard her deliver herself  something to the following purport--That, whatever penalties she was  doomed to abide, she was determined she would not bear witness against  a woman's life, from a certain conviction that it could not be a woman  who broke her house. \"I have no doubt that I may find some of my own  things there,\" added she, \"but, if they were found in her possession,  she has been made a tool, or the dupe, of an infernal set, who shall be  nameless here. I believe she did not rob me, and for that reason I will  have no hand in her condemnation.\"    The judge: \"This is the most singular perversion I have ever witnessed.  Mrs. Logan, I entertain strong suspicions that the prisoner, or her  agents, have made some agreement with you on this matter to prevent the  course of justice.\"    \"So far from that, my lord, I went into the jail at Peebles to this  woman, whom I had never seen before, and proffered to withdraw my part  in the prosecution, as well as my evidence, provided she would tell me  a few simple facts; but she spurned at my offer, and had me turned  insolently out of the prison, with orders to the jailor never to admit  me again on any pretence.\"    The prisoner's counsel, taking hold of this evidence, addressed the  jury with great fluency; and, finally, the prosecution was withdrawn,  and the prisoner dismissed from the bar, with a severe reprimand for  her past conduct, and an exhortation to keep better company.    It was not many days till a caddy came with a large parcel to Mrs.  Logan's house, which parcel he delivered into her hands, accompanied  with a sealed note, containing an inventory of the articles, and a  request to know if the unfortunate Arabella Calvert would be admitted  to converse with Mrs. Logan.    Never was there a woman so much overjoyed as Mrs. Logan was at this  message. She returned compliments. Would be most happy to see her; and  no article of the parcel should be looked at, or touched, till her  arrival. It was not long till she made her appearance, dressed in  somewhat better style than she had yet seen her; delivered her over the  greater part of the stolen property, besides many things that either  never had belonged to Mrs. Logan or that she thought proper to deny in  order that the other might retain them.    The tale that she told of her misfortunes was of the most distressing  nature, and was enough to stir up all the tender, as well as abhorrent  feelings in the bosom of humanity. She had suffered every deprivation  in fame, fortune, and person. She had been imprisoned; she had been  scourged, and branded as an impostor; and all on account of her  resolute and unmoving fidelity and truth to several of the very worst  of men, every one of whom had abandoned her to utter destitution and  shame. But this story we cannot enter on at present, as it would  perhaps mar the thread of our story, as much as it did the anxious  anticipations of Mrs. Logan, who sat pining and longing for the  relation that follows.    \"Now I know, Mrs. Logan, that you are expecting a detail of the  circumstances relating to the death of Mr. George Colwan; and, in  gratitude for your unbounded generosity and disinterestedness, I will  tell you all that I know, although, for causes that will appear obvious  to you, I had determined never in life to divulge one circumstance of  it. I can tell you, however, that you will be disappointed, for it was  not the gentleman who was accused, found guilty, and would have  suffered the utmost penalty of the law had he not made his escape. It  was not he, I say, who slew your young master, nor had he any hand in  it.\"    \"I never thought he had. But, pray, how do you come to know this?\"    \"You shall hear. I had been abandoned in York by an artful and  consummate fiend; and found guilty of being art and part concerned in  the most heinous atrocities, and, in his place, suffered what I yet  shudder to think of I was banished the county, begged my way with my  poor outcast child up to Edinburgh, and was there obliged, for the  second time in my life, to betake myself to the most degrading of all  means to support two wretched lives. I hired a dress, and betook me,  shivering, to the High Street, too well aware that my form and  appearance would soon draw me suitors enow at that throng and  intemperate time of the Parliament. On my very first stepping out to  the street, a party of young gentlemen was passing. I heard by the  noise they made, and the tenor of their speech, that they were more  then mellow, and so I resolved to keep near them, in order, if  possible, to make some of them my prey. But, just as one of them began  to eye me, I was rudely thrust into a narrow close by one of the  guardsmen. I had heard to what house the party was bound, for the men  were talking exceedingly loud, and making no secret of it: so I hasted  down the close, and round below to the one where their rendezvous was  to be; but I was too late, they were all housed and the door bolted. I  resolved to wait, thinking they could not all stay long; but I was  perishing with famine, and was like to fall down. The moon shone as  bright as day, and I perceived, by a sign at the bottom of the close,  that there was a small tavern of a certain description up two stairs  there. I went up and called, telling the mistress of the house my plan.  She approved of it mainly, and offered me her best apartment, provided  I could get one of these noble mates to accompany me. She abused Lucky  Sudds, as she called her, at the inn where the party was, envying her  huge profits, no doubt, and giving me afterwards something to drink for  which I really felt exceedingly grateful in my need. I stepped  downstairs in order to be on the alert. The moment that I reached the  ground, the door of Lucky Sudds' house opened and shut, and down came  the Honourable Thomas Drummond, with hasty and impassioned strides, his  sword rattling at his heel. I accosted him in a soft and soothing tone.  He was taken with my address; for he instantly stood still and gazed  intently at me, then at the place, and then at me again. I beckoned him  to follow me,"]]]
