It is therefore a church whose interest  is almost wholly of the past; and the traveller goes back in  imagination, century after century, to the era of Papal residency, when  the Cathedral was not only ecclesiastically important, but  architecturally in its best and purest form. This church, which Clement  V found on his removal to Avignon, and which may still be easily traced,  was of the simple, primitive Provencal style. No dates of that period  are sufficiently accurate to rely upon; but its interest lies not so  much in chronology as in its portrayal of the general type. The interior  is the usual little hall church of the XI century, with its aisle-less  nave of five bays, and plain piers supporting a tunnelled roof, with  double vault arches. Beyond the last bay, over the choir, is the  Cathedral's octagonal dome, and from the rounded windows of its lantern  comes much of the light of the interior, which is sombre and without  other windows of importance.    The facade is architecturally one of the most significant parts of the  church. Above the portal the wall is supported on either side by plain  heavy buttresses, and directly continued by the solid bulk of the tower.  In 1431 this tower replaced the original one which fell in the  earthquake of 1405. It is conjecturally similar, a heavy rectangle which  quite overweighs the church; plain, with its stiff pilasters and two  stories of rounded windows; without grace or proper proportion, but  pleasing by the unblemished severity of its lines. Above the balustrade  with which the tower may be properly said to terminate, the religious  art of the XIX century has erected as its contribution to the Cathedral  a series of steps, an octagon, and a colossal, mal-proportioned statue  of the Virgin. These additions are inharmonious; and the finest part of  the facade is the porch, so classic in detail that it was formerly  supposed to be Roman, a work of the Emperor Constantine. Like the rest  of the church, its general structure is plain and somewhat severe, with  small, richly carved details, in this instance closely Corinthian. The  rounded portal of entrance is an entablature, enclosed as it were by  two supporting columns; and above, in the pointed pediment, is a  circular opening curiously foreshadowing that magnificent development of  the North--the rose-window. Passing through the vestibule, whose  tunnel-vault supports the tower, the minor portal appears, almost a  replica of the outer door, and the whole forms an unusual mode of  entrance, graceful in detail, ponderous in general effect. Far behind  the tower of the facade rises the last significant feature of the  exterior, the little lantern. It is an octagon with Doric and Corinthian  motifs, continuing the essential characteristics of the interior, and  exceedingly typical of Provence.    [Illustration: \"THE PORCH SO CLASSIC IN DETAIL.\"--AVIGNON. _From an old  print._]    Into this church, with its few, unusually classic details, its  Provencal simplicity, its very modest size and plainness, the  munificence of papal pomp was introduced. This was in 1308, an era of  papal storm and stress. Not ten years before, Boniface VIII, with the  tradition of Canossa spurring his haughty ambitions, had launched a bull  against Philip III, whom he knew to be a bad king and whom he was to  find an equally bad, rebellious Christian. \"God,\" said the Prelate, from  Rome, \"has constituted us, though unworthy, above kings and kingdoms, to  seize, destroy, disperse, build, and plant in His name and by His  doctrine. Therefore, do not persuade thyself that thou hast no superior,  and that thou art not subject to the head of the ecclesiastical  hierarchy; he who thinks thus is insensate, he who maintains it is  infidel.\"    Past indeed was the time of Henry of Germany, long past the proud day  when a Pope received an Emperor who knelt and waited in the snow. Philip  burned the Bull; and to prevent other like fulminations, sent an agent  into Italy. Gathering a band, he found the aged Pontiff at Anagni, his  birthplace, seated on a throne, crowned with the triple crown, the Cross  in one hand and in the other Saint Peter's Keys, the terrible Keys of  Heaven and Hell. They called on him to abdicate, but Boniface thought of  Christ his Lord, and cried out in defiant answer, \"Here is my neck, here  is my head. Betrayed like Jesus Christ, if I must die like him, I will  at least die Pope.\" For reply, Sciarra Colonna, one of his own Roman  Counts, struck him in the face. Buffeted by a noble, and openly defied  by a king, Boniface died \"of shame and anger.\" A month later, this same  king rejoiced, if nothing more, at the death of the Pope's successor;  and in the dark forests of Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Philip bargained and  sold the great Tiara to a Gascon Archbishop who, if Villani speaks  truly, \"threw himself at the royal feet, saying, 'It is for thee to  command and for me to obey; such will ever be my disposition!'\" As was  not unnatural, the will of the French king was that the Pope should  remain within the zone of royal influence. So Clement lived at Bordeaux  and at Poitiers, and finally retired to the County of Venaissin which  the Holy See possessed by right, and established the pontifical court at  Avignon.    This transfer of the papal residence to Avignon has left many and deep  traces on the history of French Catholicism. The Holy See was no longer  far remote; the French ecclesiastic desirous of promotion had no  dangerous mountains to traverse, no strange city to enter, no foreign  Pontiff to besiege, ignorant or indifferent to his claims. The next  successor of Saint Peter would logically be a Frenchman, and there was  not only a possibility, but a probability for every man of note, that he  might be either the occupant of the Sacred Chair or its favoured  supporter. So Avignon became a city of priests as Rome had been before  her; and as France was the richest country in Europe and the Church  regally wealthy, splendour, luxury, and constant religious spectacles  rejoiced the city, and Bishop, Archbishop, and Abbot, brazenly  neglecting the duties of their Sees, lived here and were seldom \"in  residence.\" Every one had a secret ambition. Of such a situation, the  Popes were not slow to reap the benefits. Difference of wealth, which  brought difference of position, counted much and was keenly felt. Abbots  of smaller monasteries found themselves inferior to Bishops, especially  in freedom from papal interference; while from the inherent wealth and  power of their foundations, the heads of the great monasteries ranked  sometimes with Archbishops, sometimes even with Cardinals. The Pope had  the right to elevate an Abbey or a Priory into a Bishopric, and those  who could offer the \"gratification\" or the \"provocative,\" might  reasonably hope for the desired elevation which at once increased their  local importance, belittled a neighbouring diocese, and freed them to  some extent from the direct intermeddling of the Pope. The applications  for such an increase of power became numerous, and by 1320 a number of  Benedictine Abbeys had been made Bishoprics. Their creation greatly  decreased the direct and intimate power of the Papacy, but temporarily  increased the papal treasury; and John XXII, who left ten million pieces  of silver and fifteen million in gold with his Florentine bankers, seems  to have thought philosophically, \"After us, the deluge.\"    [Illustration: NOTRE-DAME-DES-DOMS.--AVIGNON]    Another favourite diplomatic and financial device, which was invented by  these famous Popes of Avignon, was the system of the \"Commende,\" which  enabled relatives of nobles and all those whom it was desirable to  placate, not alone ecclesiastics, but mere laymen and bloody barons, to  become \"Commendatory Abbots\" or \"Commendatory Priors,\" and to receive at  least one-third of the monastery's revenues, without being in any way  responsible for the monastery's welfare. This care was left to a  Prior or a Sub-prior, a sort of clerical administrator who, crippled in  means and in influence, was sometimes unable, sometimes unwilling, to  carry out the duties and beneficences of past ages, and who was always  the victim of a great injustice. The depths of uselessness to which this  infamous practice reduced monastic establishments may be inferred, when  it is remembered that before the XVIII century the famous Abbey of La  Baume had had thirteen Commendatory Abbots, and that the bastards of  Louis XIV were Commendatory Priors in their infancy.    The Popes found the Commende useful, not only as a means of income, but  as a method--at once secure and lucrative--of gaining to their cause the  great feudal lords of France, and making the power of these lords an  added buffer, as it were, between Avignon and the grasping might of the  French Kings. For although the Popes were under \"the special protection\"  of the Kings, it was as sheep under the special protection of a shearer,  and they found that they must protect themselves against a too \"special\"  and royal fleecing. For they did not always agree that--        \"'Tis as goodly a match as match can be      To marry the Church and the fleur-de-lis      Should either mate a-straying go,      Then each--too late--will own 'twas so.'\"    [Illustration: \"THE TOWER OF PHILIP THE FAIR.\"--VILLENEUVE-LES-AVIGNON.]    Haunted by the humiliation of their heaven-sent power, caged in  \"Babylonish captivity,\" it is conceivable that the Popes were too  occupied or, perhaps too distracted, to object to the unsuitable  modesty of Notre-Dame-des-Doms. When a Pope swept forth from his  Cathedral,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#13)"],[1,"rate. Everyone admits continents. We can see why Galapagos and       C. Verde differ <see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 398>], depressed and raised.       We can see from this repeated action and the time required for a       continent, why many more forms than in New Zealand <see _Origin_,       Ed. i. p. 389 for a comparison between New Zealand and the Cape> no       mammals or other classes <see however, _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 393 for       the case of the frog>. We can at once see how it comes when there       has been an old channel of migration,--Cordilleras; we can see why       Indian Asiatic Flora,--[why species] having a wide range gives       better chance of some arriving at new points and being selected, and       adapted to new ends. I need hardly remark no necessity for change.         Finally, as continent (most extinction <?> during formation of       continent) is formed after repeated elevation and depression, and       interchange of species we might foretell much extinction, and that       the survivor would belong to same type, as the extinct, in same       manner as different part of same continent, which were once       separated by space as they are by time <see _Origin_, Ed. i. pp.       339 and 349>.         As all mammals have descended from one stock, we ought to expect       that every continent has been at some time connected, hence       obliteration of present ranges. I do not mean that the fossil       mammifers found in S. America are the lineal successors <ancestors>       of the present forms of S. America: for it is highly improbable       that more than one or two cases (who will say how many races after       Plata bones) should be found. I believe this from numbers, who have       lived,--mere <?> chance of fewness. Moreover in every case from       very existence of genera and species only few at one time will       leave progeny, under form of new species, to distant ages; and the       more distant the ages the fewer the progenitors. An observation may       be here appended, bad chance of preservation on rising island, the       nurseries of new species, appeal to experience <see _Origin_, Ed.       i. p. 292>. This observation may be extended, that in all cases,       subsiding land must be, in early stages, less favourable to       formation of new species; but it will isolate them, and then if       land recommences rising how favourable. As preoccupation is bar to       diffusion to species, so would it be to a selected variety. But it       would not be if that variety was better fitted to some not fully       occupied station; so during elevation or the formation of new       stations, is scene for new species. But during elevation not       favourable to preservation of fossil (except in caverns <?>); when       subsidence highly favourable in early stages to preservation of       fossils; when subsidence, less sediment. So that our strata, as       general rule will be the tomb of old species (not undergoing any       change) when rising land the nursery. But if there be vestige will       generally be preserved to future ages, the new ones will not be       entombed till fresh subsidence supervenes. In this long gap we       shall have no record: so that wonderful if we should get       transitional forms. I do not mean every stage, for we cannot expect       that, as before shown, until geologists will be prepared to say       that although under unnaturally favourable condition we can trace       in future ages short-horn and Herefordshire <see note 2, p. 26>.       {Note 115}      Sec. VII. <AFFINITIES AND CLASSIFICATION.>    Looking now to the affinities of organisms, without relation to their  distribution, and taking all fossil and recent, we see the degrees of  relationship are of different degrees and  arbitrary,--sub-genera,--genera,--sub-families, families, orders and  classes and kingdoms. The kind of classification which everyone feels is  most correct is called the natural system, but no can define this. If we  say with Whewell <that we have an> undefined instinct of the importance  of organs{135}, we have no means in lower animals of saying which is  most important, and yet everyone feels that some one system alone  deserves to be called natural. The true relationship of organisms is  brought before one by considering relations of analogy, an otter-like  animal amongst mammalia and an otter amongst marsupials. In such cases  external resemblance and habit of life and _the final end of whole  organization_ very strong, yet no relation{136}. Naturalists cannot  avoid these terms of relation and affinity though they use them  metaphorically. If used in simple earnestness the natural system ought  to be a genealogical <one>; and our knowledge of the points which are  most easily affected in transmission are those which we least value in  considering the natural system, and practically when we find they do  vary we regard them of less value{137}. In classifying varieties the  same language is used and the same kind of division: here also (in  pine-apple){138} we talk of the natural classification, overlooking  similarity of the fruits, because whole plant differs. The origin of  sub-genera, genera, &c., &c., is not difficult on notion of genealogical  succession, and accords with what we know of similar gradations of  affinity in domesticated organisms. In the same region the organic  beings are <illegible> related to each other and the external conditions  in many physical respects are allied{139} and their differences of same  kind, and therefore when a new species has been selected and has  obtained a place in the economy of nature, we may suppose that  generally it will tend to extend its range during geographical changes,  and thus, becoming isolated and exposed to new conditions, will slightly  alter and its structure by selection become slightly remodified, thus we  should get species of a sub-genus and genus,--as varieties of  merino-sheep,--varieties of British and Indian cattle. Fresh species  might go on forming and others become extinct and all might become  extinct, and then we should have <an> extinct genus; a case formerly  mentioned, of which numerous cases occur in Palaeontology. But more often  the same advantages which caused the new species to spread and become  modified into several species would favour some of the species being  preserved: and if two of the species, considerably different, each gave  rise to group of new species, you would have two genera; the same thing  will go on. We may look at case in other way, looking to future.  According to mere chance every existing species may generate another,  but if any species, A, in changing gets an advantage and that advantage  (whatever it may be, intellect, &c., &c., or some particular structure  or constitution) is inherited{140}, A will be the progenitor of several  genera or even families in the hard struggle of nature. A will go on  beating out other forms, it might come that A would people earth,--we  may now not have one descendant on our globe of the one or several  original creations{141}. External conditions air, earth, water being  same{142} on globe, and the communication not being perfect, organisms  of widely different descent might become adapted to the same end and  then we should have cases of analogy{143}, [they might even tend to  become numerically representative]. From this often happening each of  the great divisions of nature would have their representative eminently  adapted to earth, to <air>{144}, to water, and to these in <illegible>  and then these great divisions would show numerical relations in their  classification.         {135} After \"organs\" is inserted, apparently as an       afterthought:--\"no, and instance metamorphosis, afterwards       explicable.\"         {136} For analogical resemblances see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 427, vi.       p. 582.         {137} \"Practically when naturalists are at work, they do not       trouble themselves about the physiological value of the       characters.... If they find a character nearly uniform, ... they       use it as one of high value,\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 417, vi. p. 573.         {138} \"We are cautioned ... not to class two varieties of the       pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most       important part, happens to be nearly identical,\" _Origin_, Ed. i.       p. 423, vi. p. 579.         {139} The whole of this passage is obscure, but the text is quite       clear, except for one illegible word.         {140} <The exact position of the following passage is uncertain:>       \"just as it is not likely every present breed of fancy birds       and cattle will propagate, only some of the best.\"         {141} This suggests that the author was not far from the principle       of divergence on which he afterwards laid so much stress. See       _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 111, vi. p. 134, also _Life and Letters_, i. p.       84.         {142} That is to say the same conditions occurring in different       parts of the globe.         {143} The position of the following is uncertain, \"greyhound and       racehorse have an analogy to each other.\" The same comparison       occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 427, vi. p. 583.         {144} _Air_ is evidently intended; in the MS. _water_ is written       twice.      Sec. VIII. UNITY [OR SIMILARITY] OF TYPE IN THE GREAT CLASSES.    Nothing more wonderful in Nat. Hist. than looking at the vast number of  organisms, recent and fossil, exposed to the most diverse conditions,  living in the most distant climes, and at immensely remote periods,  fitted to wholely different ends, yet to find large groups united by a  similar type of structure. When we for instance see bat, horse,  porpoise-fin, hand, all built on same structure{145}, having bones{146}  with same name, we see there is some deep bond of union between  them{147}, to illustrate this is the foundation and"]]]
