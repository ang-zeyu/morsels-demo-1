He bore hard on the rudder, but he could not turn the ship.    \"What is this?\" he cried. \"A strong river is running here. It is  carrying our ship away from this land. I cannot make head against it.  Out with the oars!\"    So with oars and sail and rudder they fought against the current, but it  took the boat along like a chip, and after a while they put up their  oars and drifted.    \"Luck has taken us into its own hands,\" Eric laughed. \"But this is as  good a way as another.\"    Sometimes they were near enough to see the land, then they were carried  out into the sea and thought that they should never see any land again.    \"Perhaps this river will carry us to a whirlpool and suck us under,\" the  men said.    But at last Eric felt the current less strong under his hand.    \"To the oars again!\" he called.    So they fought with the current and sailed out of it and went on toward  land. But when they reached the shore they found no place to go in.  Steep black walls shot up from the sea. Nothing grew on them. When the  men looked above the cliffs they saw a long line of white cutting the  sky.    \"It is a land of ice,\" they said.    They sailed on south, all the time looking for a place to go ashore.    \"I am sick of this endless sea,\" Thorhild complained, \"but this land is  worse.\"    After a while they began to see small bays cut into the shore with  little flat patches of green at their sides. They landed in these places  and stretched and warmed themselves and ate.    \"But these spots are only big enough for graves,\" the men said. \"We can  not live here.\"    So they went on again. All the time the weather was growing colder.  Eric's people kept themselves wrapped in their cloaks and put scarfs  around their heads.    \"And it is still summer!\" Thorhild said. \"What will it be in winter?\"    \"We must find a place to build a house now before the winter comes on,\"  said Eric. \"We must not freeze here.\"    So they chose a little spot with hills about it to keep off the wind.  They made a house out of stones; for there were many in that place. They  lived there that winter. The sea for a long way out from shore froze so  that it looked like white land. The men went out upon it to hunt white  bear and seal. They ate the meat and wore the skins to keep them warm.  The hardest thing was to get fuel for the fire. No trees grew there. The  men found a little driftwood along the shore, but it was not enough. So  they burned the bones and the fat of the animals they killed.    \"It is a sickening smell,\" Thorhild said. \"I have not been out of this  mean house for weeks. I am tired of the darkness and the smoke and the  cattle. And all the time I hear great noises, as though some giant were  breaking this land into pieces.\"    \"Ah, cheer up, good wife!\" Eric laughed. \"I smell better luck ahead.\"    Once Eric and his men climbed the cliffs and went back into the middle  of the land. When they came home they had this to tell:    \"It is a country of ice, shining white. Nothing grows on it but a few  mosses. Far off it looks flat, but when you walk upon it, there are  great holes and cracks. We could see nothing beyond. There seems to be  only a fringe of land around the edge of an island of ice.\"    The winter nights were very long. Sometimes the sun showed for an hour,  sometimes for only a few minutes, sometimes it did not show at all for a  week. The men hunted by the bright shining of the moon or by the  northern lights.    As it grew warmer the ice in the sea began to crack and move and melt  and float away. Eric waited only until there was a clear passage in the  water. Then he launched his boat, and they sailed southward again. At  last they found a place that Eric liked.    \"Here I will build my house,\" he said.    So they did and lived there that summer and pastured their cattle and  cut hay for the winter and fished and hunted.    The next spring Eric said:    \"The land stretches far north. I am hungry to know what is there.\"    Then they all got into the boat again and sailed north.    \"We can leave no one here,\" Eric had said. \"We cannot tell what might  come between us. Perhaps giants or dragons or strange men might come out  of this inland ice and kill our people. We must stay together.\"    Farther north they found only the same bare, frozen country. So after a  while they sailed back to their home and lived there.    One spring after they had been in that land for four years, Eric said:    \"My eyes are hungry for the sight of men and green fields again. My  stomach is sick of seal and whale and bear. My throat is dry for mead.  This is a bare and cold and hungry land. I will visit my friends in  Iceland.\"    \"And our swords are rusty with long resting,\" said his men. \"Perhaps we  can find play for them in Iceland.\"    \"Now I have a plan,\" Eric suddenly said. \"Would it not be pleasant to  see other feast halls as we sail along the coast?\"    \"Oh! it would be a beautiful sight,\" his men said.    \"Well,\" said Eric, \"I am going to try to bring back some neighbors from  Iceland. Now we must have a name for our land. How does Greenland  sound?\"    His men laughed and said:    \"It is a very white Greenland, but men will like the sound of it. It is  better than Iceland.\"    So Eric and all his people sailed back and spent the winter with his  friends.    \"Ah! Eric, it is good to hear your laugh again,\" they said.    Eric was at many feasts and saw many men, and he talked much of his  Greenland.    \"The sea is full of whale and seals and great fish,\" he said. \"The land  has bear and reindeer. There are no men there. Come back with me and  choose your land.\"    Many men said that they would do it. Some men went because they thought  it would be a great frolic to go to a new country. Some went because  they were poor in Iceland and thought:    \"I can be no worse off in Greenland, and perhaps I shall grow rich  there.\"    And some went because they loved Eric and wanted to be his neighbors.    So the next summer thirty-five ships full of men and women and goods  followed Eric for Greenland. But they met heavy storms, and some ships  were wrecked, and the men drowned. Other men grew heartsick at the  terrible storm and the long voyage and no sight of land, and they turned  back to Iceland. So of those thirty-five ships only fifteen got to  Greenland.    \"Only the bravest and the luckiest men come here,\" Eric said. \"We shall  have good neighbors.\"    Soon other houses were built along the fiords.    \"It is pleasant to sail along the coast now,\" said Eric. \"I see smoke  rising from houses and ships standing on the shore and friendly hands  waving.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [14] See note about peace-bands on page 199.          [Illustration]    Leif and His New Land      Now Eric had lived in Greenland for fifteen years. His sons Thorstein  and Leif had grown up to be big, strong men. One spring Leif said to his  father:    \"I have never seen Norway, our mother land. I long to go there and meet  the great men and see the places that skalds sing about.\"    Eric answered:    \"It is right that you should go. No man has really lived until he has  seen Norway.\"    So he helped Leif fit out a boat and sent him off. Leif sailed for  months. He passed Iceland and the Faroes and the Shetlands. He stopped  at all of these places and feasted his mind on the new things. And  everywhere men received him gladly; for he was handsome and wise. But at  last he came near Norway. Then he stood up before the pilot's seat and  sang loudly:        \"My eyes can see her at last,      The mother of mighty men,      The field of famous fights.      In the sky above I see      Fair Asgard's shining roofs,      The flying hair of Thor,      The wings of Odin's birds,      The road that heroes tread.      I am here in the land of the gods,      The land of mighty men.\"    For a while he walked the land as though he were in a dream. He looked  at this and that and everything and loved them all because it was  Norway.    \"I will go to the king,\" he said.    He had never seen a king. There were no kings in Iceland or in  Greenland. So he went to the city where the king had his fine house. The  king's name was Olaf. He was a great-grandson of Harald Hairfair; for  Harald had been dead a hundred years.    Now the king was going to hold a feast at night, and Leif put on his  most beautiful clothes to go to it. He put on long tights of blue wool  and a short jacket of blue velvet. He belted his jacket with a gold  girdle. He had shoes of scarlet with golden clasps. He threw around  himself a cape of scarlet velvet lined with seal fur. His long sword  stuck out from under his cloak. On his head he put a knitted cap of  bright colors. Then he walked to the king's feast hall and went through  the door. It was a great hall, and it was full of richly-dressed men.  The fires shone on so many golden head-bands and bracelets and so many  glittering swords and spears on the wall, and there was so much noise of  talking and laughing, that at first Leif did not know what to do. But at  last he went and sat on the very end seat of the bench near him.    As the feast went on, King Olaf sat in his high seat and looked about  the hall and noticed this one and that one and spoke across the fire to  many. He was keen-eyed and soon saw Leif in his far seat.    \"Yonder is some man of mark,\" he said to himself. \"He is surely worth  knowing. His face is not the face of a fool. He carries his head like a  lord of men.\"    He sent a thrall and asked Leif to come to him. So Leif walked down the  long hall and stood before the king.    \"I am glad to have you for a guest,\" the king said. \"What are your name  and country?\"    \"I am Leif Ericsson, and I have come all the way from Greenland to see  you and old Norway.\"    \"From Greenland!\" said the king. \"It is not often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#13)"],[1,"very little comfort from that, for  he knew well enough that the tawny-hided creatures would approach in  their crawling, cat-like fashion, and a dozen might be even then hidden  behind the bushes, or flattened down in the sand, or dry, shrubby  growth, with which their coats so assimilated as to make them invisible  to the most practised eye.    Dyke's teeth were pressed so hard together that they emitted a peculiar  grinding sound with the exertion as he leaped down, and the dog looked  up in a puzzled way, and uttered an uneasy bark.    Dyke started.  The dog must scent danger, he thought, and the next  glance was at Breezy, whose instinct would endorse the dog's knowledge;  but the cob was blowing the insects off the tender shoots at every  breath, and browsing contentedly enough.    It was fancy.  The great, foul birds were coming nearer, but Dyke knew  that he could keep a thousand of them away by flourishing his empty gun.    Then a sudden thought occurred to him, and he turned excitedly to the  dog, taking off his canvas pouch the while, and shaking it.    \"Hi, Duke!  Hey there, good old boy!  Lost--lost!  Seek them!  Good dog,  then!  Seek--seek!  Lost!\"    The dog barked excitedly, sniffed at the pouch, looked up at his master,  whined and barked, sniffed again at the pouch, and finally, in answer to  Dyke's shouts and gestures, took another sharp sniff at the canvas, and  bounded away, head down, and following the track made by the eland, the  horses, and his own feet.    \"What an idiot I was not to think of that before!\" said the boy to  himself.  \"He'll find it, as sure as sure.\"    Then he gave another glance round, to stand repentant as he followed the  figure of the retiring dog, and felt ready to call it back, for he was  increasing the terrible loneliness by sending away his dumb friend, one  who would have instantly given him warning of the approach of danger.    Once more Dyke went through a mental battle.  He was mastering the  strong desire to call back the dog, and forcing himself to take out his  knife and use it as a bill-hook to cut a quantity of the dry, short  bush, piling it up until he had enough to make a fire.  This he started,  and felt better, for the flame and smoke would keep off animals, show  where he was, and cook his dinner, about which he had begun to think  eagerly, as well as of his position.    \"I wonder whether other fellows of my age are so ready to take fright at  everything.  It's so stupid, just because the place is open and lonely.  Fancy wanting to keep Duke back when he is pretty well sure to find my  cartridge pouch, and bring it here.  It's a good job no one knows what  we feel sometimes.  If any one did, how stupid we should look.\"    The fire burned briskly, with the white smoke rising steadily up in the  still air, as, after trying whether the edge of his sheath-knife had  been blunted by cutting the bush wood, he attacked the great antelope to  secure a good steak to broil.    \"Plenty to cut at,\" he said with a laugh; and his mouth watered now at  the thought of the juicy frizzle he could make on the glowing embers,  which would soon be ready for his purpose.  But he went to work  judiciously.  His experience in the lonely, wild country had taught him  a little of the hunter's craft, and he knew the value of the magnificent  skin which covered the eland; so making certain cuts, he drew back the  hide till a sufficiency of the haunch was bared, and after cutting a  pair of skewer-like pieces from a bush, he carved a good juicy steak,  inserted his skewers, spread out the meat, and stuck the sharper ends of  the pieces of wood in the sand, so that the steak was close to, and well  exposed to the glow.  Then leaving it to roast, Dyke carefully drew the  skin back into its place and set to work washing his hands.    Only a dry wash in the soft reddish sand, but wonderfully cleansing when  repeated two or three times, and very delightful as a make-shift, where  there is no water.    By the time Dyke's hands were presentable, and he had piled-up some more  bush where the fire had burned into a hole, the meat began to sputter,  and drops of fat to drip in the hot embers, producing odours so  attractive to a hungry lad, to whom fresh meat was a luxury, that Dyke's  thoughts were completely diverted from the loneliness of his position,  and he thought of nothing but the coming dinner as he took from his  pocket a lump of heavy mealie cake which had been brought by way of  lunch.    \"Wish I'd brought a bit of salt,\" he said to himself and a few minutes  later, as he saw the full pound and a half steak beginning to curl up  and shrink on one side, another thought struck him.  Wasn't it a pity  that he had not cut a bigger slice, for this one shrank seriously in the  cooking?    But concluding that it would do for the present, he carefully withdrew  the sticks from the sand, and turning them about, replaced them so as to  cook the other side, congratulating himself the while upon the fact that  the meat tightly embraced the pieces of wood, and there was no fear of  the broil falling into the sand.    \"Don't want that kind of salt peppered over it,\" he said in a mixed  metaphorical way, and after a look at Breezy, who was browsing away  contentedly, Dyke smiled happily enough.  Then inhaling the delicious  odours of the steak, he knelt there, with the fire glancing upon his  face and the sun upon his back, picking up and dropping into places  where they were needed to keep up the heat, half-burnt pieces of the  short, crisp wood.    It was so pleasant and suggestive an occupation that Dyke forgot all  about danger from wild beasts, or trampling from a startled herd coming  back his way.  For one moment he thought of Duke, and how long he would  be before he came back with the cartridge pouch.  He thought of Emson,  too, in regard to the steak, wishing he was there to share it, and  determining to have the fire glowing and another cut ready to cook.    Then, springing up, he ran to where Breezy raised his head with a  pleasant whinny of welcome, took the water-bottle he always carried from  where it was strapped to the back of the saddle, and returned to the  cooking.    \"Done to a turn,\" he cried, as he caught up the two pieces of wood which  held the steak, bore his dinner away a few yards from the fire, sat down  holding the skewers ready, and then placing his cake bread in his lap,  he began to cut off pieces of the meat.    \"De--licious!\" he sighed, \"but a trifle hot,\" and then everything was  resolved into the question of meat--rich, tender, juicy meat--glorious  to one whose fare had been dry, leathery, rather tainted biltong for a  long while past.    Dyke ate as he had never eaten before, till the last fragment was  reached--a peculiarly crisp, brown, tempting-looking piece adhering to  one of the skewers.  This he held back for a few moments in company with  the last piece of mealie cake, wishing the while that he had cooked  more, and brought a larger piece of the cake.    \"Roast beef's nothing to it,\" he said softly.  \"Wish old Joe had been  here to have a bit while it's so tender, and poor old Duke, too.  Never  mind, he shall have double allowance when he does come--triple if he  brings my pouch.  I wonder whether he has found it.  It's wonderful what  he can do in that way.\"    He raised his eyes to gaze in the direction taken by the dog as he sat  there near the fire, and the huge carcass of the eland behind him, and  then he seemed to have been suddenly turned into stone--sitting with the  bit of cake in one hand, the skewer in the other, staring, with white  rings round his eyes, straight at a full-grown, handsomely maned lion,  standing about twenty yards away, gazing at him straight in the face.        CHAPTER TEN.    THE HUNTER HUNTED.    Dyke was completely paralysed in body, but his mind was wonderfully  active, and he noted that the horse even had not divined the approach of  the great beast, but was puffing away with snorting breath at the  insects upon the tender shoots, and browsing contentedly enough, while  the lion had stolen softly up nearer and nearer, without a sound, after  perhaps following on the track of the antelopes for weeks, and taking  toll from time to time, which might have accounted for its sleek  condition and glistening hide.    In spite of the feeling of horror which chilled the boy, he could not  help admiring the beauty of the magnificent beast before him, with its  full flowing mane, and sunny, yellowish eyeballs intently watching him,  as the long lithe tail, with its black tuft of long hairs at the tip,  swung to and fro, now seen upon the left side, now upon the right, in  other respects the great animal being as motionless as the boy.    For many moments Dyke could not even breathe, but at last he uttered a  gasp, followed by a sharp, catching sound, as he inspired with a sob,  and the lion raised the hair about his ears, as if to frown, and uttered  a low, deep, growling noise.    Dyke's heart seemed to stand still as, with his eyes still fixed upon  those of the beast, he waited for it to spring upon him, and drive him  back.  What then?    He shuddered softly, trying hard not to move, and irritate the lion into  hastening its aggression at a time when life was so sweet, and every  moment was greedily grasped before the end.  He was horribly frightened,  but this did not trouble him so much, for he felt stunned, and a great  deal of what passed was dreamy, and seen as if through a mist.  But one  thing he knew, and that was that he would have some little warning of  the attack, for the lion would crouch and gather its hind-legs well  under it before it made its spring.    Then a wave of energy ran through Dyke, who, though still motionless,  felt his heart throb with greater vigour as he began to think of  self-defence.  There was his gun close at hand, so near that he could  have reached it; but it was"]]]
