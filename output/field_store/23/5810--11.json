All winter long we had wandered through the rice-fields of the South.    \"We were not happy there.  We feared for our lives.  There we are not  called bobolinks and the people of the South never listen for our songs.    \"In fact we seldom sing when we are in the South.  The hunters call us  'rice-birds' or 'reed-birds.'  With their terrible guns they hunt us  early and late.    \"It was no wonder, then, that we were so glad to return to the North.  It was a long journey, but we did not tire.  In fact we travelled  mostly at night.  During the day we feasted in the fields or at grain  stacks.    \"For a few days we flew about here, and sang out our names to every  passer-by.    \"Just ten days after our arrival something very wonderful happened.  Our sisters and wives and sweethearts came with fluttering wings and  sweet, quiet ways.    \"On that very day I met the lovely bird who now broods so gently over  our eggs.    \"She seemed to me the most beautiful bobolink that ever was.  Early and  late I sang to her.  My most beautiful songs seemed not half good  enough for so lovely a bird.    \"I, alas, was not the only bobolink who admired her.  My own brother  was quite as delighted with her.  He, too, sang to her.    \"Sometimes we sat in the same tree, each of us singing our hearts out  to the shy little creature whom we both loved.    \"I am sorry to say we did more than sing for the demure little bird.  We fought for her.  We quarrelled fiercely.  But at last it was I who  won her, and my brother found for himself another wife.\"    \"I wish I could find your nest,\" said Phyllis.    \"It is in this field,\" said the bobolink.  \"It is near the brook, and  every morning we both fly down there for a refreshing bath.    \"I have told you all this, and yet, Phyllis, I venture to say that you  might hunt all day among the grasses and not find my nest.  For the  leaves and the grasses bend over and about the nest where my little  mate sits.    \"Should I call to her she would come to me.  You perhaps would run to  the spot where she rose from the grass.  But you would not find the  nest.    \"My wife in her quiet brown dress is too wise for that.  She never  flies up directly from the nest.  She runs a distance among the grass  stems and then starts up from the grasses.    \"There are five eggs in the nest, light blue with spots of blackish  brown.    \"When they are hatched, you will hear very little music from me.  I  shall put on a quiet dress, much like the one which my mate now wears,  and will work early and late bringing food to my babies.    \"They shall have the very choicest grains and bugs and grasshoppers.  There will soon be no time for singing.\"    \"But when the little ones are grown--\" said Phyllis.    \"Oh, yes, then I will sing again for you.  But listen, Phyllis!\"    Phyllis heard a sweet little \"Chink!  Chink!  Chink!\"    \"My little mate is calling,\" gurgled the bobolink, flying away and  leaving the grass-top swaying wildly.          ROBERT OF LINCOLN      Merrily swinging on brier and weed,      Near to the nest of his little dame,    Over the mountainside or mead,      Robert of Lincoln is telling his name.          \"Bobolink, bob-o'-link,          Spink, spank, spink;    Snug and safe is that nest of ours,    Hidden among the summer flowers,          Chee, chee, chee!\"      Robert of Lincoln is gaily drest,      Wearing a bright black wedding-coat,    White are his shoulders and white his crest.      Hear him call in his merry note:         \"Bobolink, bob-o'-link,         Spink, spank, spink;    Look what a nice new coat is mine,    Sure there was never a bird so fine!         Chee, chee, chee!\"      Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,      Pretty and quiet in plain brown wings,    Passing at home a patient life,      Broods in the grass while her husband sings:          \"Bobolink, bob-o-link,          Spink, spank, spink;    Brood, kind creature, you need not fear    Thieves and robbers while I am here!

ALL ABOUT THE BOBOLINK OR RICEBIRD    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Male arrives north middle of May.--Female comes some ten or twelve days  later--travel generally by night and in flocks.--Flies south from  August to October.    Song is most musical and sweet, expressing joy and careless  happiness--the song of the female is but a short, sweet \"Chink,  chink.\"--While the young are being cared for, the male does not sing as  he does earlier in the season, but takes up the plaintive \"chink\" of  his mate.    Male in spring is black with pale yellow markings on back and wings and  tail.  Yellow spot on back of neck--a patch of white on breast and  other white markings.    Female pale yellow beneath--upper parts generally brown--two dark  stripes on top of the head.  In autumn plumage of male resembles female.    Nest of grasses well hidden by thick leaves and stems.--Usually built  in clump of grasses and always on the ground and very shallow.    Eggs are pale blue with dark brown spots.--Four or five in  number.--Young birds when fully feathered are so alike that in a flock  young cannot be distinguished from old.          THE SEA-DOVES    AND THE    GREAT BLUE HERON    [Illustration: Great Blue Heron]    BESIDE THE SEA    One hot August day Phyllis went to the seashore to live.    \"Such fun,\" she cried, as the train drew up at the seaside station.  \"Such fun as I shall have playing in the sand and wading in the water.\"    It was not half an hour before she was running along the beach beside  the cliffs.  Her feet were bare, and she wriggled her toes in the sand  and splashed into the puddles of water.    Presently she saw a number of little birds running along the beach and  flying over the water.    \"How swiftly they fly, and how well they dive,\" she said.  \"How easily  they swim, and they sometimes settle on the waves and rest.  I wish  they would come nearer!\"    \"I will tell you about them,\" said a solemn voice near by.  Phyllis  stumbled in her surprise and splashed the water into her eyes.  When  she could see again, a great blue heron was standing near.    \"Oh!\" cried Phyllis, a bit frightened.  \"It is strange that I did not  see you.  Yes, do tell me about the little sea-bird--and about yourself  also!\"    So the blue heron drew his head down between his shoulders, and,  standing on one leg, told Phyllis what he knew of the little sea-doves.    \"That little bird with brown back and white breast loves the sea,\" said  the heron.  \"He is never tired of the blue waves.    \"In stormy weather the little sea-dove is most happy, because it is  then that the waves are laden with small fish and crabs.  During stormy  weather the little fisherman grows fat.    \"Watch them as they fly.  Do you see how they are constantly dipping  their bills into the water?  That is their way of fishing.    \"The sea-doves' nests are among the cliffs.  In them they lay just two  bluish-white little eggs.    \"Sometimes, when the winds are very strong, the sea-doves are blown far  inland.  Sometimes they find their way back to the sea.  But there are  other times when they do not return.\"    \"And where is your own nest, O Great Blue Heron?\" asked Phyllis, half  laughing at the queer, long-legged bird.    \"It is over yonder on a rock,\" said the heron.  \"There are now four  dull blue-green eggs in the nest.    \"Soon there will be four ugly, helpless birdlings, who will sit up and  cry for food.  It will be at least three weeks after they are hatched  before they will try to wade out into these flat sea-marshes.  I shall  have to let no fish escape me, if I do not wish the fledglings to  starve.\"    \"You do not think your babies pretty?\" asked Phyllis.    \"No,\" said the heron, truthfully, \"they are not even so good-looking as  other birds' babies.  But that I do not mind, for will they not some  day be as beautiful as I myself?\"    \"Yes,\" said Phyllis, \"I have seen your picture many a time.  In  mother's room is a large screen and on it is your likeness embroidered  in silks.  The long green grasses are growing about you in the picture.  One foot is drawn up and your head is drawn down between your shoulders  just as it now is.\"    \"That is the way to rest,\" said the heron.    \"What were you doing here?\" Phyllis asked, wading a little closer to  the long-legged bird.    \"I was fishing,\" said the great blue heron.  \"It is the one thing I  delight in.  From morning till night--\"    \"My brother Jack--\" began Phyllis, but the bird paid no attention.    \"I sometimes stand here perfectly still for hours.  I wait patiently  for the fish or the frogs to appear.    \"Then I strike suddenly with my strong, sharp bill.  I snap up the fish  or frog and give it a knock or two to kill it.    \"Then I eat it.  If it is a fish I swallow it, head first, so that the  scales shall not scratch my throat.    \"But see, Phyllis, the sun has set, and I have not yet had my supper.  I really must leave you!\"    Then the great blue heron rose slowly and silently and circled away  over the flat sea-marshes.  Barefooted Phyllis scampered back to the  little seaside cottage, where a fish supper was awaiting her.          SEA-PIGEONS    It was very early in the spring.  The sun rose, stayed for only a  moment above the horizon, and then sank again from the sight of Eskimo  children.    But already huge icebergs broke from the shore and floated out to sea.  Already the icy winds hurried away farther north.  Already a few of the  bravest birds were returning for the summer season.    It happened that a whole family of Eskimo children ran shouting and  laughing along the top of a cliff which overhung the sea.    The older"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#13)"],[1," as well  have thrown it behind her, for not a morsel did her any good.    After the feast she went to her room, but all night long she could not  once close her eyes or fall asleep, she was so sorrowful. She thought  of her bridegroom so constantly that she was afraid she would fall ill  from longing. Her principal grief was that she did not know why he had  gone away without saying even one word.    The next day she went to the emperor and told him she was seized with  so great a longing for her husband that she was going to follow him  till she found him. The emperor tried to detain her, but she would  not listen and set out on her journey.    She searched up and down the whole city, but did not find him  anywhere. Then she wandered from place to place till she met him  serving in a tavern.    As soon as she saw him she went up and spoke to him, but he pretended  not to know her, turned his head away, made no answer, and went about  his business.    The princess followed him everywhere, begging him to say just one word  to her, but in vain. When the landlord saw that the stranger was to  blame for the interruption in the work, he said: \"Why don't you let my  servant finish his work in peace? Don't you see he is dumb? Be kind  enough to go away from here, if you are a respectable woman.\"    \"He isn't dumb,\" she cried, \"this is my husband, who deserted and fled  from me on account of a fault of mine.\"    All the people in the tavern stood still in astonishment when they  heard her words, for she was not joking; but the landlord could not  believe it, he thought it would be impossible for a man who could  speak to live a whole week without saying even one word, and every  body really knew him as a dumb man, made him understand by signs, and  liked him for his industry.    The princess then entered into an agreement with them all, that she  would induce him to speak within three days if they would only allow  her to stay with him, but if she did not succeed she would be hung.  This agreement was put in writing and shown to the magistrates for  their sanction. When the contract was concluded, the three days' trial  was arranged to begin the next morning.    The fisherman at first knew nothing about this agreement, though he  heard of it afterward, but the emperor's daughter never left his side.    \"My beloved husband,\" she said, \"you know I am to blame. I chose you  because I loved you; I swear that I will never commit such a blunder  again; have pity on me, speak one word to me, save me from the  disgrace that is killing me. I know you have a right to be angry, but  for the sake of my love, forgive me.\"    The fisherman turned his head toward her, shrugged his shoulders, and  pretended that he did not know her, and did not understand what she  was talking about. One day, two days passed, and he did not even say  boo. When the third came the princess was terribly frightened, and  wherever the dumb man went she followed, beseeching him to say one  word to her.    But the fisherman, feeling that she was softening him by her  entreaties, fled like a savage that she might not assail him with  tears, and pretended his heart was a lump of ice; but she did not  cease imploring him a thousand times, so tenderly that it would have  softened even a wild beast.    At last the third day also passed, and the fisherman had not even said  baa.    Every body wondered over these things. Nothing was talked of in the  whole city, except the mute servant at the tavern and the beautiful,  charming girl, who, it was supposed, had mistaken the dumb man for  some one else, and had now brought herself into trouble.    The next day the gallows was ready, and the whole population gathered  around it to witness the end of the affair.    The magistrates were summoned to the place, and, against their will,  compelled to execute what was in the agreement.    The executioner came, and called upon the princess to submit to the  penalty, since she had not succeeded in fulfilling the obligations she  had imposed upon herself; the girl turned once more to the fisherman,  and, sobbing bitterly, tried to soften his heart, but in vain. When  she saw and understood that no escape was possible, she loosed her  hair and let it fall over her shoulders, wailing so piteously that it  was enough to make even wood and stone weep for her, and so walked  toward the place of execution. All the people, old and young, were  weeping around her, yet could not help her.    On reaching the gallows, she once more gazed hopefully at the dumb  man, who had come with the crowd, but stood as if he were perfectly  unmoved, and said to him:    \"My dear husband, save me from death; you know my love for you, do not  let me perish so ignominiously. Speak but one word and I shall be  delivered.\" But the man only shrugged his shoulders and glanced  backward across the fields.    The executioner stood with the noose in his hand; two assistants led  her up the ladder, and the hangman slipped the rope around her neck.  One moment more, and the princess would have been a corpse! But just  at the instant the executioner was going to let her swing out into the  empty air, the fisherman raised his hand, shouting: \"Hi! hi! stop!\"    They all stood motionless, tears of joy streamed from every eye as the  hangman took the noose from the prisoner's neck. Then the fisherman,  looking at the royal maiden, said three times:    \"Will you say fisherman to me again?\"    \"Forgive me, my dear husband,\" the princess hastened to reply, \"I have  only said it once, and that was by mistake. I promise you not to do so  again.\"    \"Let her come down, she is my wife.\"    He took her by the hand, and they went home together.    Afterward they lived in peace and happiness, and if they haven't died,  they are living still.        Into the saddle then I sprung,      This tale to tell to old and young.          Little Wild-Rose.      Once upon a time something extraordinary happened. If it had not  happened it would not be told. It was when the wolves lay down to rest  with the sheep, and the shepherds feasted in the green fields with  emperors and kings, when one sun rose and another set.    There was once a man, my dear good friends. This man would now--I am  telling no lie--this man would now be a hundred years old, if not  twenty more to boot; his wife, too, was older than any body I know;  she was like the Friday-goddess (Venus), and from youth to age had  never had a single child. Only those who know what children are in a  house can understand the uncontrollable grief in the empty home of the  old man and his wife. The poor old man had done every thing in his  power to have his house brightened and filled with joy by what he  himself so greatly desired. He had given alms to the convents and  churches, he had had liturgies read in seven churches, had sent for  priests with white beards, because they are the holiest men and have  more earnestness in prayer, and had had masses read for all the  saints and prayers for the last unction. But every thing was useless.  The old wife had clung to the witches and magicians. There was not an  enchanter to whom she had not gone for advice, even if he lived a  week's journey off. As I said before, what wouldn't she have done! But  it was vain, all was useless.    One day the old man said sadly and thoughtfully:    \"Old wife!\"    \"What do you want?\"    \"Give me some provisions to take with me on my journey, for I intend  to travel through the wide world, looking wherever I go to try and  find a child, for my heart aches and burns when I think that the end  of my life is drawing near, and no heir will have my house after me,  but all my property fall into the hands of strangers. I have tried all  ways, now I will take this one. And I'll tell you one thing: If I find  no child, I won't come home any more.\"    With these words the old man took his knapsack on his back, went out  of the house, and began his journey. He walked on and on and on  through the kingdom and the world, as God willed. Listen, good  friends, I am telling the truth. He walked on till he came to a thick  forest, so dense that it seemed like a wall. Tree was intwined with  tree, bush with bush, so that the sun could not even send so much as a  ray of light through the foliage. When the old man saw these vast  woods he thrice made the sign of the cross toward the east, prostrated  himself three times, also toward the east, and then entered with great  sorrow. How long a time he spent in groping about the forest I don't  know, but I do know that one day he reached the entrance of a cave.  This cave was hundreds and thousands of times darker than the deep  forest, as dark as it is when we shut our eyes, as dark as it usually  is in endless caverns. The old man crossed himself three times, fell  on his knees several times, and then, with God's assistance, turned  around a projection of a rock. He went about the distance of a  gun-shot and saw a light in a cranny. Approaching nearer and nearer he  could not believe his eyes when he saw what was standing beside it. An  old hermit! He was very old, as ancient as the world. He had a white  beard that reached to his knees, and when he raised his eyebrows and  then lowered them again they shaded the whole cave.    The hermit stood like a pillar of stone, his eyes fixed on a  psalm-book on which his elbow rested, and which was sprinkled with big  red characters; it was very, very old, so old that God alone knew to  what period it belonged; and on a broad stone a yellow wax-candle  blazed with a red flame and a blue smoke that was as dense as a cloud.  The old man approached the praying saint and, again falling on his  knees, said:    \"Good-evening, holy father!\"    The hermit was so absorbed in his litany that he heard nothing. So our  old man spoke louder. The hermit did not stir, but made him a sign  with his crutch to move aside. The old man stood aloof"]]]
