Of course this summons was not the flat failure which Allied  reports led the West to believe at the time. As a matter of fact, there  was trouble in practically every Mohammedan land under Allied control.  To name only a few of many instances: Egypt broke into a tumult  smothered only by overwhelming British reinforcements, Tripoli burst  into a flame of insurrection that drove the Italians headlong to the  coast, Persia was prevented from joining Turkey only by prompt  Russo-British intervention, while the Indian North-West Frontier was the  scene of fighting that required the presence of a quarter of a million  Anglo-Indian troops. The British Government has officially admitted that  during 1915 the Allies' Asiatic and African possessions stood within a  hand's breadth of a cataclysmic insurrection.    That insurrection would certainly have taken place if Islam's leaders  had everywhere spoken the fateful word. But the word was not spoken.  Instead, influential Moslems outside of Turkey generally condemned the  latter's action and did all in their power to calm the passions of the  fanatic multitude.    The attitude of these leaders does credit to their discernment. They  recognized that this was neither the time nor the occasion for a  decisive struggle with the West. They were not yet materially prepared,  and they had not perfected their understandings either among themselves  or with their prospective non-Moslem allies. Above all, the moral urge  was lacking. They knew that athwart the Khalifa's writ was stencilled  \"Made in Germany.\" They knew that the \"Young-Turk\" clique which had  engineered the coup was made up of Europeanized renegades, many of them  not even nominal Moslems, but atheistic Jews. Far-sighted Moslems had no  intention of pulling Germany's chestnuts out of the fire, nor did they  wish to further Prussian schemes of world-dominion which for themselves  would have meant a mere change of masters. Far better to let the West  fight out its desperate feud, weaken itself, and reveal fully its future  intentions. Meanwhile Islam could bide its time, grow in strength, and  await the morrow.    The Versailles peace conference was just such a revelation of European  intentions as the Pan-Islamic leaders had been waiting for in order to  perfect their programmes and enlist the moral solidarity of their  followers. At Versailles the European Powers showed unequivocally that  they had no intention of relaxing their hold upon the Near and Middle  East. By a number of secret treaties negotiated during the war, the  Ottoman Empire had been virtually partitioned between the victorious  Allies, and these secret treaties formed the basis of the Versailles  settlement. Furthermore, Egypt had been declared a British protectorate  at the very beginning of the war, while the Versailles conference had  scarcely adjourned before England announced an \"agreement\" with Persia  which made that country another British protectorate in fact if not in  name. The upshot was, as already stated, that the Near and Middle East  were subjected to European political domination as never before.    But there was another side to the shield. During the war years the  Allied statesmen had officially proclaimed times without number that the  war was being fought to establish a new world-order based on such  principles as the rights of small nations and the liberty of all  peoples. These pronouncements had been treasured and memorized  throughout the East. When, therefore, the East saw a peace settlement  based, not upon these high professions, but upon the imperialistic  secret treaties, it was fired with a moral indignation and sense of  outraged justice never known before. A tide of impassioned determination  began rising which has set already the entire East in tumultuous  ferment, and which seems merely the premonitory ground-swell of a  greater storm. So ominous were the portents that even before the  Versailles conference had adjourned many European students of Eastern  affairs expressed grave alarm. Here, for example, is the judgment of  Leone Caetani, Duke of Sermoneta, an Italian authority on Mohammedan  questions. Speaking in the spring of 1919 on the war's effect on the  East, he said: \"The convulsion has shaken Islamic and Oriental  civilization to its foundations. The entire Oriental world, from China  to the Mediterranean, is in ferment. Everywhere the hidden fire of  anti-European hatred is burning. Riots in Morocco, risings in Algiers,  discontent in Tripoli, so-called Nationalist attempts in Egypt, Arabia,  and Lybia are all different manifestations of the same deep sentiment,  and have as their object the rebellion of the Oriental world against  European civilization.\"[55]    Those words are a prophetic forecast of what has since occurred in the  Moslem world. Because recent events are perhaps even more involved with  the nationalistic aspirations of the Moslem peoples than they are with  the strictly Pan-Islamic movement, I propose to defer their detailed  discussion till the chapter on Nationalism. We should, however, remember  that Moslem nationalism and Pan-Islamism, whatever their internal  differences, tend to unite against the external pressure of European  domination and equally desire Islam's liberation from European  political control. Remembering these facts, let us survey the present  condition of the Pan-Islamic movement.    Pan-Islamism has been tremendously stimulated by Western pressure,  especially by the late war and the recent peace settlements. However,  Pan-Islamism must not be considered as merely a defensive political  reaction against external aggression. It springs primarily from that  deep sentiment of unity which links Moslem to Moslem by bonds much  stronger than those which unite the members of the Christian world.  These bonds are not merely religious, in the technical sense; they are  social and cultural as well. Throughout the Moslem world, despite wide  differences in local customs and regulations, the basic laws of family  and social conduct are everywhere the same. \"The truth is that Islam is  more than a creed, it is a complete social system; it is a civilization  with a philosophy, a culture, and an art of its own; in its long  struggle against the rival civilization of Christendom it has become an  organic unit conscious of itself.\"[56]    To this Islamic civilization all Moslems are deeply attached. In this  larger sense, Pan-Islamism is universal. Even the most liberal-minded  Moslems, however much they may welcome Western ideas, and however  strongly they may condemn the fanatical, reactionary aspects of the  political Pan-Islamic movement, believe fervently in Islam's essential  solidarity. As a leading Indian Moslem liberal, The Aga Khan, remarks:  \"There is a right and legitimate Pan-Islamism to which every sincere and  believing Mohammedan belongs--that is, the theory of the spiritual  brotherhood and unity of the children of the Prophet. The real spiritual  and cultural unity of Islam must ever grow, for to the follower of the  Prophet it is the foundation of the life and the soul.\"[57]    If such is the attitude of Moslem liberals, thoroughly conversant with  Western culture and receptive to Western progress, what must be the  feelings of the Moslem masses, ignorant, reactionary, and fanatical?  Besides perfectly understandable fear and hatred due to Western  aggression, there is, among the Moslem masses, a great deal of genuine  fanaticism caused, not by European political domination, but by  religious bigotry and blind hatred of Western civilization.[58] But this  fanaticism has, of course, been greatly inflamed by the political events  of the past decade, until to-day religious, cultural, and political  hatred of the West have coalesced in a state of mind decidedly ominous  for the peace of the world. We should not delude ourselves into  minimizing the dangerous possibilities of the present situation. Just  because the fake \"Holy War\" proclaimed by the Young-Turks at German  instigation in 1914 did not come off is no reason for believing that a  real holy war is impossible. As a German staff-officer in Turkish  service during the late struggle very candidly says: \"The Holy War was  an absolute fiasco just because it was not a Holy War.\"[59] I have  already explained how most Moslems saw through the trick and refused to  budge.    However, the long series of European aggressions, culminating in the  recent peace settlements which subjected virtually the entire Moslem  world to European domination, have been steadily rousing in Moslem  hearts a spirit of despairing rage that may have disastrous  consequences. Certainly, the materials for a holy war have long been  heaping high. More than twenty years ago Arminius Vambery, who knew the  Moslem world as few Europeans have ever known it, warned the West of the  perils engendered by recklessly imperialistic policies. \"As time  passes,\" he wrote in 1898, \"the danger of a general war becomes ever  greater. We should not forget that time has considerably augmented the  adversary's force of resistance. I mean by this the sentiment of  solidarity which is becoming livelier of late years among the peoples of  Islam, and which in our age of rapid communication is no longer a  negligible quantity, as it was even ten or twenty years ago.    \"It may not be superfluous to draw the attention of our  nineteenth-century Crusaders to the importance of the Moslem press,  whose ramifications extend all over Asia and Africa, and whose  exhortations sink more profoundly than they do with us into the souls of  their readers. In Turkey, India, Persia, Central Asia, Java, Egypt, and  Algeria, native organs, daily and periodical, begin to exert"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#13)"],[1,"put on her were  only lent to her for the occasion. This is curiously suggestive of the  marriage investiture of Eastern Hindostan.    In Westerly, R. I., in 1724, other smock-marriages were recorded, and in  Lincoln County, Me., in 1767, between John Gatchell and Sarah Cloutman,  showing that the belief in this vulgar error was wide-spread. The most  curious variation of this custom is told in the \"Life of Gustavus  Vassa,\" wherein that traveller records that a smock-marriage took place  in New York in 1784 on a gallows. A malefactor condemned to death, and  about to undergo his execution, was reprieved and liberated through his  marriage to a woman clad only in a shift.    In spite of the hardness and narrowness of their daily life, and the  cold calculation, the lack of sentiment displayed in wooing, I think  Puritan husbands and wives were happy in their marriages, though their  love was shy, almost sombre, and \"flowered out of sight like the fern.\"  A few love-letters still remain to prove their affection: letters of  sweethearts and letters of married lovers, such as Governor Winthrop  and his wife Margaret; letters like the words of another Margaret--a  queen--to her \"alderliefest;\" letters so simple and tender that truth  and love shine round them like a halo:         \"MY OWN DEAR HUSBAND: How dearly welcome thy kind letter was to me,       I am not able to express. The sweetness of it did much refresh me.       What can be more pleasing to a wife than to hear of the welfare of       her best beloved and how he is pleased with her poor endeavors! I       blush to hear myself commended, knowing my own wants. But it is       your love that conceives the best and makes all things seem better       than they are. I wish that I may always be pleasing to thee, and       that these comforts we have in each other may be daily increased so       far as they be pleasing to God. I will use that speech to thee that       Abigail did to David, I will be a servant to wash the feet of my       lord; I will do any service wherein I may please my good husband. I       confess I cannot do enough for thee; but thou art pleased to accept       the will for the deed and rest contented. I have many reasons to       make me love thee, whereof I shall name two: First, because thou       lovest God, and secondly, because thou lovest me. If these two were       wanting all the rest would be eclipsed. But I must leave this       discourse and go about my household affairs. I am a bad housewife       to be so long from them; but I must needs borrow a little time to       talk with thee, my sweetheart. It will be but two or three weeks       before I see thee, though they be long ones. God will bring us       together in good time, for which time I shall pray. And thus with       my mother's and my own best love to yourself I shall leave       scribbling. Farewell my good husband, the Lord keep thee.                                    \"Your obedient wife,                                         \"MARGARET WINTHROP.\"    Who can read the beautiful words without feeling for that sweet  Margaret, who died two centuries ago, a thrill of the affection that  must have glowed for her in John Winthrop's heart, when, far away from  her, he first opened and read this tender letter.    Warm eulogies did many a staid New Englander write of his loving  consort, eulogies in rhyme, and epitaphs, elegies, threnodies,  epicediums, anagrams, acrostics, and pindarics, all speaking loudly of  loving, \"painful\" care, if not of a spirit of poesy. And the even,  virtuous tenor of the life in New England proved too a happiness and  contentment equal to the marital results of more emotional and romantic  love-making. There were some divorces. Madam Knight found that they were  plentiful in Connecticut in 1704, as they are in that State nowadays.  She writes:         \"These uncomely Stand-aways are too much in vogue among the English       in this indulgent colony, as their records plentifully prove; and       that on very trivial matters of which some have been told me, but       are not Proper to be Related by a Female Pen.\"    In town records we find that divorces, though infrequent, still were  occasionally given in other New England States; but the causes assigned  therefor, to follow Madam Knight's example, need not be \"Related by a  Female Pen.\"          III    DOMESTIC SERVICE      It is plainly evident that in a country where land was to be had for the  asking, fuel for the cutting, corn for the planting and harvesting, and  game and fish for the least expenditure of labor, no man would long  serve for another, and any system of reliable service indoors or afield  must fail. Whether the colonists came to work or not, they had to in  order to live, for domestic service was soon in the most chaotic state.  Women were forced to be notable housekeepers; men were compelled to  attend to every detail of masculine labor in their households and on  their farms, thus acquiring and developing a \"handiness\" at all trades,  which has become a Yankee trait.    The question of adequate and proper household service soon became a  question of importance and of painful consideration in the new land.  Rev. Ezekiel Rogers wrote most feelingly in 1656 on this subject:         \"Much ado have I with my own family, hard to get a servant glad of       catechizing or family duties. I had a rare blessing of servants in       Yorkshire, and those I brought over were a blessing, but the young       brood doth much afflict me.\"    The Massachusetts colonists had attempted even before starting, to meet  and simplify the servant question by rigidly excluding any corrupt  element. They even sent back to England boys who had been unruly on  shipboard. But the number of penalties imposed on servants during the  early years are a lasting record of the affliction caused by the young  brood.    All the early travellers speak of the lack of good servants in the new  land. The \"Diary of a French Refugee in Boston,\" in 1687, says: \"There  is an absolute Need of Hired help;\" and that savages were employed in  the fields at eighteen-pence a day. This latter form of service was  naturally the first way of solving the vexed question. The captives in  war were divided in lots and assigned to housekeepers. We find even  gentle Roger Williams asking for \"one of the drove of Adam's degenerate  seed\" as a slave. Hugh Peters, of Salem, wrote to a Boston friend: \"Wee  haue heard of a diuidence of women & children in the baye & would bee  glad of a share viz.: a young woman or girle & a boy if you thinke  good.\" Two years later he wrote: \"My wife desires my daughter to send to  Hanna that was her maid now at Charlestowne to know if she would dwell  with us, for truly wee are now so destitute (having now but an Indian)  that wee know not what to do.\" Lowell thus comments on such savage  ministrations:         \"Let any housewife of our day who does not find the Keltic element       in domestic life so refreshing as to Mr. Arnold in literature,       imagine a household with one wild Pequot woman, communicated with       by signs, for its maid-of-all-work, and take courage. Those were       serious times indeed when your cook might give warning by taking       your scalp or chignon, as the case might be, and making off with it       into the woods.\"    We frequently glean from diaries of the times hints of the pleasures of  having a wild Nipmuck or Narragansett Indian as \"help.\" Rev. Peter  Thatcher, of Milton, Mass., bought an Indian in 1674 for L5 down and L5  more at the end of the year--a high-priced servant for the times. One of  her duties was, apparently, the care of a young Thatcher infant. Shortly  after the purchase, the reverend gentleman makes this entry in his  diary: \"Came home and found my Indian girl had liked to have knocked my  Theodorah on the head by letting her fall. Whereupon I took a good  walnut stick and beat the Indian to purpose till she promised to do so  no more.\" Mr. Thatcher was really a very kindly gentleman and a good  Christian, but the natural solicitude of a young father over his  firstborn provoked him to the telling use of the walnut stick as a  civilizing influence.    When we reach newspaper days we find Indian servants frequently among  the runaways; as Mather said, they could not endure the yoke; and,  indeed, it would seem natural enough that any such wild child of the  forests should flee away from the cramped atmosphere of a Puritan  household and house. We read pathetic accounts of the desertion of aged  colonists by their Indian servants. One writes that he took his \"Pecod  girle\" as a \"chilld of death\" when but two years old, had reared her  kindly, nursed her in sickness, and now she had run away from him when  he sorely needed her, and he wished to buy a blackamoor in her place.  Sometimes the description of the costumes in which these savages took  their flitting, is extremely picturesque. This is from the _Boston News  Letter_ of October, 1707:         \"Run away from her master Baker. A tall Lusty Carolina Indian woman       named Keziah Wampum, having long straight Black Hair tyed up with a       red Hair Lace, very much marked in the hands and face. Had on a       strip'd red blue & white Homespun Jacket & a Red one. A Black &       White Silk Crape Petticoat, A White Shift, as Also a blue one with       her, and a mixt Blue and White Linsey Woolsey Apron.\"    A reward of four pounds was offered for this barbaric creature.    Another Indian runaway in 1728 was thus bedizened, showing a startling  progress in adornment from the apron of skins and blanket of her  wildwood home.         \"She wore off a Narrow Stript pinck Cherredary Goun turn'd up with       a little flour'd red & white Callico. A Stript Homespun Quilted       Petticoat, a plain muslin Apron, a suit of plain Pinners & a red &       white flower'd knot, also a pair of green Stone"]]]
