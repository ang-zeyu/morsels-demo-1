I have said that Peterkin walked along the sands between us.  We had two  ways of walking together about our island.  When we travelled through  the woods we always did so in single file, as by this method we advanced  with greater facility, the one treading in the other's footsteps.  In  such cases Jack always took the lead, Peterkin followed, and I brought  up the rear.  But when we travelled along the sands, which extended  almost in an unbroken line of glistening white round the island, we  marched abreast, as we found this method more sociable and every way  more pleasant.  Jack, being the tallest, walked next the sea, and  Peterkin marched between us, as by this arrangement either of us could  talk to him or he to us, while if Jack and I happened to wish to  converse together we could conveniently do so over Peterkin's head.  Peterkin used to say, in reference to this arrangement, that had he been  as tall as either of us, our order of march might have been the same;  for, as Jack often used to scold him for letting everything we said to  him pass in at one ear and out at the other, his head could, of course,  form no interruption to our discourse.    We were now fairly started.  Half-a-mile's walk conveyed us round a bend  in the land which shut out our bower from view, and for some time we  advanced at a brisk pace without speaking, though our eyes were not  idle, but noted everything--in the woods, on the shore, or in the sea--  that was interesting.  After passing the ridge of land that formed one  side of our valley--the Valley of the Wreck--we beheld another small  vale lying before us in all the luxuriant loveliness of tropical  vegetation.  We had indeed seen it before from the mountain-top, but we  had no idea that it would turn out to be so much more lovely when we  were close to it.  We were about to commence the exploration of this  valley when Peterkin stopped us, and directed our attention to a very  remarkable appearance in advance along the shore.    \"What's yon, think you?\" said he, levelling his spear as if he expected  an immediate attack from the object in question, though it was full  half-a-mile distant.    As he spoke, there appeared a white column above the rocks, as if of  steam or spray.  It rose upwards to a height of several feet, and then  disappeared.  Had this been near the sea, we would not have been so  greatly surprised, as it might in that case have been the surf, for at  this part of the coast the coral reef approached so near to the island  that in some parts it almost joined it.  There was, therefore, no lagoon  between, and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the rocks.  But this white column appeared about fifty yards inland.  The rocks at  the place were rugged, and they stretched across the sandy beach into  the sea.  Scarce had we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight  when another column flew upwards for a few seconds, not far from the  spot where the first had been seen, and disappeared; and so, at long,  irregular intervals, these strange sights recurred.  We were now quite  sure that the columns were watery, or composed of spray; but what caused  them we could not guess, so we determined to go and see.    In a few minutes we gained the spot, which was very rugged and  precipitous, and, moreover, quite damp with the falling of the spray.  We had much ado to pass over dry-shod.  The ground, also, was full of  holes here and there.  Now, while we stood anxiously waiting for the  reappearance of these waterspouts, we heard a low, rumbling sound near  us, which quickly increased to a gurgling and hissing noise, and a  moment afterwards a thick spout of water burst upwards from a hole in  the rock and spouted into the air with much violence, and so close to  where Jack and I were standing that it nearly touched us.  We sprang  aside, but not before a cloud of spray descended and drenched us both to  the skin.    Peterkin, who was standing farther off; escaped with a few drops, and  burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter on beholding our miserable  plight.    \"Mind your eye!\" he shouted eagerly; \"there goes another!\"  The words  were scarcely out of his mouth when there came up a spout from another  hole, which served us exactly in the same manner as before.    Peterkin now shrieked with laughter; but his merriment was abruptly put  a stop to by the gurgling noise occurring close to where he stood.    \"Where'll it spout this time, I wonder?\" he said, looking about with  some anxiety and preparing to run.  Suddenly there came a loud hiss or  snort; a fierce spout of water burst up between Peterkin's legs, blew  him off his feet, enveloped him in its spray, and hurled him to the  ground.  He fell with so much violence that we feared he must have  broken some of his bones, and ran anxiously to his assistance; but  fortunately he had fallen on a clump of tangled herbage, in which he lay  sprawling in a most deplorable condition.    It was now our turn to laugh; but as we were not yet quite sure that he  was unhurt, and as we knew not when or where the next spout might arise,  we assisted him hastily to jump up and hurry from the spot.    I may here add that, although I am quite certain that the spout of water  was very strong, and that it blew Peterkin completely off his legs, I am  not quite certain of the exact height to which it lifted him, being  somewhat startled by the event, and blinded partially by the spray, so  that my power of observation was somewhat impaired for the moment.    \"What's to be done now?\" asked Peterkin ruefully.    \"Make a fire, lad, and dry ourselves,\" replied Jack.    \"And here is material ready to our hand,\" said I, picking up a dried  branch of a tree as we hurried up to the woods.    In about an hour after this mishap our clothes were again dried.  While  they were hanging up before the fire we walked down to the beach, and  soon observed that these curious spouts took place immediately after the  fall of a huge wave, never before it; and, moreover, that the spouts did  not take place excepting when the billow was an extremely large one.  From this we concluded that there must be a subterraneous channel in the  rock into which the water was driven by the larger waves, and finding no  way of escape except through these small holes, was thus forced up  violently through them.  At any rate, we could not conceive any other  reason for these strange waterspouts, and as this seemed a very simple  and probable one, we forthwith adopted it.    \"I say, Ralph, what's that in the water?  Is it a shark?\" said Jack just  as we were about to quit the place.    I immediately ran to the overhanging ledge of rock, from which he was  looking down into the sea, and bent over it.  There I saw a very faint,  pale object of a greenish colour, which seemed to move slightly while I  looked at it.    \"It's like a fish of some sort,\" said I.    \"Hallo, Peterkin!\" cried Jack.  \"Fetch your spear; here's work for it!\"    But when we tried to reach the object, the spear proved to be too short.    \"There, now,\" said Peterkin with a sneer; \"you were always telling me it  was too long.\"    Jack now drove the spear forcibly towards the object, and let go his  hold.  But although it seemed to be well aimed, he must have missed, for  the handle soon rose again; and when the spear was drawn up, there was  the pale-green object in exactly the same spot, slowly moving its tail.    \"Very odd!\" said Jack.    But although it was undoubtedly very odd, and although Jack and all of  us plunged the spear at it repeatedly, we could neither hit it nor drive  it away, so we were compelled to continue our journey without  discovering what it was.  I was very much perplexed at this strange  appearance in the water, and could not get it out of my mind for a long  time afterwards.  However, I quieted myself by resolving that I would  pay a visit to it again at some more convenient season.        CHAPTER TEN.    MAKE DISCOVERY OF MANY EXCELLENT ROOTS AND FRUITS--THE RESOURCES OF THE  CORAL ISLAND GRADUALLY UNFOLDED--THE BANYAN TREE--ANOTHER TREE WHICH IS  SUPPORTED BY NATURAL PLANKS--WATER-FOWL FOUND--A VERY REMARKABLE  DISCOVERY, AND A VERY PECULIAR MURDER--WE LUXURIATE ON THE FAT OF THE  LAND.    Our examination of the little valley proved to be altogether most  satisfactory.  We found in it not only similar trees to those we had  already seen in our own valley, but also one or two others of a  different species.  We had also the satisfaction of discovering a  peculiar vegetable, which, Jack concluded, must certainly be that of  which he had read as being very common among the South Sea Islanders,  and which was named taro.  Also we found a large supply of yams, and  another root like a potato in appearance.  As these were all quite new  to us, we regarded our lot as a most fortunate one, in being thus cast  on an island which was so prolific and so well stored with all the  necessaries of life.  Long afterwards we found out that this island of  ours was no better in these respects than thousands of other islands in  those seas.  Indeed, many of them were much richer and more productive;  but that did not render us the less grateful for our present good  fortune.  We each put one of these roots in our pocket, intending to use  them for our supper--of which more hereafter.  We also saw many  beautiful birds here, and traces of some four-footed animal again.  Meanwhile the sun began to descend; so we returned to the shore and  pushed on, round the spouting rocks, into the next valley.  This was  that valley of which I have spoken as running across the entire island.  It was by far the largest and most beautiful that we had yet looked  upon.  Here were trees of every shape and size and hue which it is  possible to conceive of, many of which we had not seen in the other  valleys; for, the stream in this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#13)"],[1,"|                 |        |        |  | Saponification  | Iodine | Titre, |  | Equivalent.[10] |   No.  | deg.C. |  |_________________|________|________|  |                 |        |        |  |     298.4       | 115.6  |  20.2  |  |_________________|________|________|    _Wheat oil_, extracted from the wheat germ by means of solvents, has  been suggested as applicable for soap-making (H.

Rosin is the residuum remaining after distillation of spirits of  turpentine from the crude oleo-resin exuded by several species of the  pine, which abound in America, particularly in North Carolina, and also  flourish in France and Spain. The gigantic forests of the United States  consist principally of the long-leaved pine, _Pinus palustris  (Australis)_, whilst the French and Spanish oleo-resin is chiefly  obtained from _Pinus pinaster_, which is largely cultivated.    Rosin is a brittle, tasteless, transparent substance having a smooth  shining fracture and melting at about 135 deg. C. (275 deg. F.). The American  variety possesses a characteristic aromatic odour, which is lacking in  those from France and Spain. It is graded by samples taken out of the  top of every barrel, and cut into 7/8 of an inch cubes, which must be  uniform in size--the shade of colour of the cube determines its grade  and value.    The grades are as follows:--              W. W.  (Water white.)            W. G.  (Window glass.)            N.     (Extra pale.)            M.     (Pale.)            K.     (Low pale.)            I.     (Good No. 1.)            H.     (No. 1.)            G.     (Low No. 1.)            F.     (Good No. 2.)            E.     (No. 2.)            D.     (Good strain.)            C.

The manufacture of alkali was at one time carried on in conjunction with  soap-making, but of late years it has become more general for the soap  manufacturer to buy his caustic soda or carbonated alkali from the  alkali-maker.    Although there are some alkali-makers who invoice caustic soda and soda  ash in terms of actual percentage of sodium oxide (Na_{2}O), it is the  trade custom to buy and sell on what is known as the English degree,  which is about 1 per cent. higher than this.    The English degree is a survival of the time when the atomic weight of  sodium was believed to be twenty-four instead of twenty-three, and,  since the error on 76 per cent. Na_{2}O due to this amounts to about 1  per cent., may be obtained by adding this figure to the sodium oxide  really present.    _Caustic soda_ (sodium hydrate) comes into commerce in a liquid form as  90 deg. Tw. (and even as high as 106 deg. Tw.), and other degrees of dilution,  and also in a solid form in various grades as 60 deg., 70 deg., 76-77 deg., 77-78 deg.  These degrees represent the percentage of sodium oxide (Na_{2}O) present  plus the 1 per cent. The highest grade, containing as it does more  available caustic soda and less impurities, is much more advantageous in  use.    _Carbonate of soda_ or _soda ash_, 58 deg., also termed \"light ash,\" and  \"refined alkali\". This is a commercially pure sodium carbonate  containing about 0.5 per cent. salt (NaCl). The 58 deg. represents the  English degrees and corresponds to 99 per cent. sodium carbonate  (Na_{2}CO_{3}).    _Soda ash_, 48 deg., sometimes called \"caustic soda ash,\" often contains  besides carbonate of soda, 4 per cent. caustic soda (sodium hydrate),  and 10 per cent. salt (sodium chloride), together with water and  impurities.    The 48 degrees refers to the amount of alkali present in terms of sodium  oxide (Na_{2}O), but expressed as English degrees.    _Caustic potash_ (potassium hydrate) is offered as a liquid of 50-52 deg. B.  (98-103 deg. Tw.) strength, and also in solid form as 75-80 deg. and 88-92 deg. The  degrees in the latter case refer to the percentage of potassium hydrate  (KHO) actually present.    _Carbonate of Potash._--The standard for refined carbonate of potash is  90-92 per cent. of actual potassium carbonate (K_{2}CO_{3}) present,  although it can be obtained testing 95-98 per cent.      OTHER MATERIALS.    _Water._--Water intended for use in soap-making should be as soft as  possible. If the water supply is hard, it should be treated chemically;  the softening agents may be lime and soda ash together, soda ash alone,  or caustic soda. There are many excellent plants in vogue for water  softening, which are based on similar principles and merely vary in  mechanical arrangement. The advantages accruing from the softening of  hard water intended for steam-raising are sufficiently established and  need not be detailed here.    _Salt_ (sodium chloride or common salt, NaCl) is a very important  material to the soap-maker, and is obtainable in a very pure state.    Brine, or a saturated solution of salt, is very convenient in  soap-making, and, if the salt used is pure, will contain 26.4 per cent.  sodium chloride and have a density of 41.6 deg. Tw. (24.8 deg. B.).    The presence of sulphates alters the density, and of course the sodium  chloride content.    Salt produced during the recovery of glycerine from the spent lyes often  contains sulphates, and the density of the brine made from this salt  ranges higher than 42 deg. Tw. (25 deg. B.).    _Soapstock._--This substance is largely imported from America, where it  is produced from the dark-coloured residue, termed mucilage, obtained  from the refining of crude cotton-seed oil. Mucilage consists of  cotton-seed oil soap, together with the colouring and resinous  principles separated during the treatment of the crude oil. The  colouring matter is removed by boiling the mucilage with water and  graining well with salt; this treatment is repeated several times until  the product is free from excess of colour, when it is converted into  soap and a nigre settled out from it.    Soapstock is sold on a fatty acid basis; the colour is variable.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Calculated by us from saponification value.    [2] Calculated by us from saponification value.
