Early in the  morning they would start out in parties of from six to a dozen, with a  Cock at the head of each. He chose the way in which they should go; he  watched the sky for Hawks, and if he saw one, gave a warning cry that  made the Hens hurry to him. The Cocks are the lords of the poultry-yard  and say how things shall be there; but when you see them leading the way  in the fields,--ah, then you know why all the fowls obey them.    The farmyard people still tell of the day when a Hawk swooped down on  one of the young Dorkings and would have carried him off if the Black  Spanish Cock had not jumped out, and pecked him and struck at him with  his spurs, and fought, until the Hawk was glad to hurry away. The Cocks  are not only brave--they are polite, too, and when they find food they  will not eat it until they have called the Hens to come and share with  them.    You can imagine what good times the Chickens had in the stubble-fields.  They were so old now that their down was all covered with feathers, and  some of them wondered if they couldn't feel their spurs growing. Still,  that was all nonsense, as a Bantam told them, because spurs do not start  until the fowl is a year old. They had long been too large to cuddle  under their mother's feathers at night, and had taken their first  lessons in roosting before they went to the stubble-fields. They had  learned to break up their own food, too, and that was a great help to  their mother. Fowls, you know, have no teeth, and no matter how big a  mouthful one takes he has to swallow it whole. The only way they can  help themselves is to break the pieces apart with their feet or peck  them apart with their bills before eating them.    The yellow grains of wheat that lay everywhere in the field were fine  food, and should have made the little Shanghais as fat as the Grouse who  sometimes stole out from the edge of the forest. Eleven of the brood  were quite plump, but one Chicken was still thin and lank. His mother  was very much worried about him and could not think what was the matter.  She spoke of it to the Black Spanish Hen one day, but the Black Spanish  Hen had never raised a brood, and said she really didn't know any more  about the care of Chickens than if she were a Dove. Then the anxious  mother went to the Shanghai Cock about it. He listened to all she said  and looked very knowing.    \"I don't think there is anything the matter,\" said he. \"The Chick is  growing fast, that is all. I remember how it was with me before I got my  long tail-feathers. I was very thin, yet see what a fine-looking fellow  I am now.\" He was really a sight worth seeing as he towered above the  other fowls, flapping his strong wings in the sunshine and crowing. His  feathers were beautiful, and the bright red of his comb and wattles  showed that he was well. \"Ah,\" thought the Shanghai Hen, \"if my Chicken  could only become such a fine-looking Cock!\" And she didn't worry any  more all day.    That night she and her brood roosted in the old apple-tree in the corner  of the orchard nearest the poultry-yard. She flew up with the older  fowls and fluttered and lurched and squawked and pushed on first one  branch and then another, while the Chickens were walking up a slanting  board that the farmer had placed against one of the lower branches. It  always takes fowls a long time to settle themselves for the night. They  change places and push each other, and sometimes one sleepy Hen leans  over too far and falls to the ground, and then has to begin all over  again.    At first the Chickens had feared that they would tumble off as soon as  they were asleep, but they soon learned that their feet and the feet of  all other birds are made in such a way that they hang on tightly even  during sleep. The weight of the bird's body above hooks the toes around  the branch, and there they stay until the bird wishes to unhook them.    After a long time, all the fowls were asleep with their heads under  their wings. The Sheep, Pigs, and Cows were dreaming, and even the  Horses were quiet in their stalls. There was not a light to be seen in  the big white farmhouse, when the Dorking Cock crowed in his sleep. That  awakened him and all the other fowls as well. Then the other Cocks  crowed because he did and he crowed again because they did, and they  crowed again because he had crowed again, and the Chickens asked if it  were not almost morning, and their mothers told them not to talk but to  go to sleep at once and make morning come more quickly.    All of this took quite a while, and the Shanghai mother could not sleep  again. She could see her brood quite plainly in the moonlight, and one  of them was not plump like the rest. She roosted there and worried about  him until suddenly (she could never tell how it happened) she seemed to  know just what was the matter.    She flew down beside him and poked him under his wing. \"Wake up,\" she  said. \"I want to ask you something. Do you eat gravel?\"    \"No,\" he answered sleepily, \"I don't like gravel.\"    \"Didn't I bring you up to eat it?\" she asked sternly.    \"Yes, but I don't like it, and now that I am old enough to roost in a  tree I don't mean to eat any more. So!\"    Just imagine a Chicken talking to his mother in that way! His mother,  who had laid the egg from which he was hatched; who had sat upon the  nest through all the weary days and nights while he was growing inside  his shell; who had cuddled him under her soft feathers; who had taught  him all he knew, and would have fought any hawk to save him! She had  begun to love him before he even knew that he was, and had lived for him  and his brother and sisters ever since.    The mother said nothing more to him then. She spent the rest of the  night watching the stars and the moon and the first rosy flush of the  eastern sky which told that morning was near. Then she said to her  naughty Chicken, as he began to stir and cheep, \"I shall never try to  make you eat gravel if you think you are too big to mind your mother. I  shall just tell you this, that you will never be strong unless you do. I  have not told you why, because you never asked, and I supposed you would  do as you ought without knowing the reason. You have no teeth, and you  cannot chew the grain you eat before it is swallowed. You have a strong  stomach, and if you eat gravel this stomach or gizzard will rub and  press the tiny stones against the grain until it is well broken up and  ready to make into fat and strength for your body.\"    \"But it doesn't taste good,\" he replied, \"and I'd rather eat other  things. I don't believe it matters, and I won't eat it anyway.\"    The Shanghai Hen flew down from the tree and clucked to her Chickens.  She would not waste time talking to him. Whenever he came near her that  day, he ate everything but gravel. He had his own way and yet he was not  happy. For some reason, nothing seemed to be any fun. Even lying under  the bushes on the sunshiny side was not comfortable, and when he  wallowed in the dust with his brothers and sisters he didn't enjoy that.    Things went on this way for a good many days, and at last he saw that  his shadow was only a small black spot on the ground, while his  brothers and sisters had big fat shadows. He heard the Black Spanish  Cock call him a Bantam, and the Shanghai Cock say that he wouldn't live  until his spurs grew. One of the Dorking Chickens was talking to her  sister, and he heard her say, \"Imagine him at the head of a flock!\" Then  she laughed, a mean, cackling little laugh.    That night, when the rest were asleep in the apple-tree, he walked  softly down the slanting board and ate gravel. The next morning he felt  better than he had in a long time, so when there was nobody around he  ate some more. He didn't want anyone else to know that he had found out  his mistake. Every morning he looked at his shadow, and it grew fatter  and fatter. Still he was not happy, and he knew it was because he had  not told his patient old mother. He wanted to tell her, too. One day he  heard her telling his brother to eat more gravel, and the brother said  he didn't like the taste of it. That made him speak at last.    \"Suppose you don't like it, you can eat it. Queer world it would be if  we didn't have to do unpleasant things. I've just made up my mind that  the people who won't do hard things, when they ought to, have the  hardest times in the end. Wish I'd minded my mother and eaten gravel  when she told me to, and I'm not going to let you be as foolish as I  was.\"    Just then he heard somebody say of him, \"What a fine-looking fellow he  is growing to be! I like him ever so much now.\"    It was the Dorking Chicken who had laughed at him. He ran after a  Grasshopper, and she ran after the same Grasshopper, and they ran  against each other and the Grasshopper got away, so of course they had  to wander off together to find something to eat, and after that they  became great friends.    The Shanghai Hen looked lovingly after him and raised one foot in the  air. \"Now,\" she said, \"I am perfectly happy.\"          THE GOOSE WHO WANTED HER OWN WAY      It would be hard to tell which family is the most important among the  farmyard people. There is no one animal so wise as Collie, the farmer's  dog, and all the rest love him and mind him when he is sent to bring  them up from the pasture or to drive them to the water. Still, he does  not spend his days in barn or field and only comes with his master or  for a visit now and then.    You may remember how the Garter Snake and the old Tree Frog were the  leaders in the meadow, and how in the forest all looked up to the Ground  Hog. These people were patient and old, and partly because they were old  and had had many years in which to think about life, they were very  wise. In the farmyard the Oxen were the most patient and the oldest, and  it was"]]]
