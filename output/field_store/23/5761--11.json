[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#13)"],[1," got to make  your rifle fire better than his, and you have got to keep it better.    The proposition is this: The enemy is on the defense. He is in a  number-one, first-class trench. It is constructed with steel, concrete,  and sandbags. It has all the improvements that science can devise. Your  business is to attack and crush the enemy. How can you advance over  exposed ground against such a position? The man behind all those modern  improvements has got to stick his head up more or less when he fires. If  the volume and rate and accuracy of your fire is greater than his, he  will grow timid about the matter. His fire will become less effective.  That is to say, he cannot have fire superiority. When your side has fire  superiority, it not only can advance upon such a position but it can do  so without ruinous losses, and with hope of success.    To obtain this fire superiority it is necessary to produce a heavier  volume of accurate fire than your opponent can produce. We can get a  proper conception of the ideas involved by imagining two firemen in a  fight armed with hose. One has a larger hose and a greater water  pressure than the other. All else being equal, we can foresee clearly  who will be the victor and who will be defeated. The more water one  throws into the other's face, the less accurate and effective will the  other's aim become. This is equally true with bullets. Put a man on the  target range, where no danger whatsoever is involved, and he may fire  with a nice degree of accuracy. Put him on the battle-field with a great  number of bullets whizzing around his head, and he must be a trained  veteran to fire with the same accuracy. This is true simply because we  have been made that way.    The volume and accuracy of fire depend upon several considerations: (a)  Of primary importance is the number of rifles employed. Let us imagine a  battle-line one mile long. It is obvious that we cannot have one man  firing behind another. We don't want to destroy our own men. They must,  therefore, be placed side by side. Each man must have sufficient room to  operate his rifle. Experience tells us that we must not have more than  one man per yard. We thus see that our battle-line of a mile can only  have about eighteen hundred rifles. (b) The rate of fire affects its  volume; an excessive rate reduces its accuracy. If you were hunting  tigers, you can easily imagine where one well-aimed and well-timed shot  could be of more use to you and more harm to the tiger than half a dozen  shots fired too rapidly. (c) If the target is large, is clear (can be  easily seen), and is but a short distance from you, your fire, for  reasons that do not require explanations, can be more rapid. Greater  density increases the effect. Suppose a hundred deer were grazing on a  hill; you would be more likely to kill some deer than if only a half  dozen were there. (d) The position of the target influences the effect  of fire. Suppose that ten men were lined up in a row against a wall and  that it is your business to kill the lot with a rifle. If you are in  front of them, ten shots at least will be required. But it is possible  for you to take a position in prolongation of the line (on its flank)  and kill the entire number with one bullet. (This also illustrates the  extreme vulnerability of flanks.)    What are the important steps that must be taken if you are going to get  this fire superiority? 1st, Fire Direction. 2d, Fire Control. 3d, Fire  Discipline.        FIRE DIRECTION      A company that cannot start firing or stop firing, that cannot fire  faster or slower, that cannot distribute equally its fire over an  opposing target, that cannot switch its fire from one place to another  and make bull's-eyes, would be as unsuccessful in battle to-day as  Harvard's football team would be, without practice, in its final game  with Yale. The team work in no department of athletics is as necessary  or vital as that of a military force, the teamwork of a military  machine. The first is a sport, a limited time being involved. The second  is a question of life and death to the nation.    It requires a nice and cool judgment, under actual conditions of war, to  point out and distribute properly the target to the different groups, to  find the exact range, and give all these instructions (directions) that  will be necessary to produce an effective fire upon the enemy. Who is  responsible for giving these instructions (fire direction), and exactly  what are all the conditions that must be fulfilled in order that each  individual on the firing line may know exactly where and how to fire?    The captain (company commander) is responsible for all. In the military  world there is no such thing as shifting responsibilities. The commander  assumes full responsibility, whether things go right or wrong. He must  handle his job through his subordinates (platoon leaders). 1st, He  points out the target to his platoon leaders. 2d, He assigns a part of  the target to each platoon, in such a manner that the entire target  (objective) will be covered (fired upon). 3d, He determines and gives  the men the distance to the objective (range). 4th, He indicates the  kind of fire to be employed (that is, whether each man will fire as he  pleases, fire five shots and then stop, et cetera). 5th, He indicates  when the company is to commence firing. 6th, Thereafter the captain  observes what effect his company's fire is producing, and corrects  flagrant (material) errors. He prevents the exhaustion of his ammunition  and distributes such extra ammunition as may be received from the rear.        FIRE CONTROL      We have just described what the captain directs. Now we must put his  directions (orders) into effect. This is done through his platoon  leaders, assisted by the platoon guides and the corporals. 1st, The  platoon leaders point out and describe their part of the objective  (target) to the corporals. 2d, They assign a particular part of the  objective to each corporal with the view of covering equally with the  fire the entire objective. 3d, They announce the range (distance to the  objective) to their platoons. 4th, If any part of the line cannot see  the objective, the platoon leaders must make the changes so that it can  see, or so that its fire will be effective. 5th, They order their  platoons to open fire at the proper time. Thereafter they observe the  target and make any necessary changes to keep the fire effective, i.e.,  fire fast or slow, according to the necessity, and are on the alert for  any commands or signals from the captain.    The platoon guides do one thing only: they watch the firing line and  check every breach of fire discipline. (See \"Fire Discipline,\" below.)    The corporals have four distinct duties. 1st, They transmit the commands  and signals to their squads when necessary. 2d, They observe the conduct  of their squads and abate excitement. 3d, They do all in their power to  enforce discipline. 4th, They participate in the firing.        FIRE DISCIPLINE      Now we come to the individual private on the firing line. All of the  above measures for efficiency will come to but little unless the man  with the gun can understand and do what he is directed to do. This  training is called Fire Discipline.    Fire Discipline implies, besides a habit of obedience, a control of the  rifle by the soldier (the result of training), which will enable him in  action to make hits instead of misses. It embraces: 1st, Taking  advantage of the ground. 2d, Care in setting the sight and delivery of  fire. 3d, Constant attention to the orders of the leaders, and careful  observation of the enemy. 4th, An increase of fire when the target is  favorable, and a cessation of fire when the enemy disappears. 5th,  Economy of ammunition.      Summary    Fire Direction is the issuance of instructions regarding the firing.    Fire Control is the explanation of these instructions through the  platoon leaders.    Fire Discipline is the quality which enables the soldier to submit to  control and fire efficiently under all conditions.          CHAPTER VII    THE SERVICE OF SECURITY        \"Security\" has the same meaning in the military world as elsewhere. We  properly think of the security of our persons, our property, our  families in connection with the term. In the military world the family,  or community, being so much larger, the word \"security\" acquires  additional dignity.    A husband and father provides for the protection of his family whether  at home or abroad. So does the military commander for his command,  whether it is an army or a squad; whether it is in camp, on the march,  in battle, advancing upon or retreating from the enemy. The end desired  is the same in all cases. A study of all the measures adopted by the  successful generals in history shows that the means are not very  different.    A body of troops in camp is protected (made secure) by the use of groups  placed between the enemy and the camp. We were told by a bee expert in  Arizona that a limited number of bees remained in the vicinity of the  hive. They were quick to observe and resist (the two great duties of an  outpost) any intruder.    Suppose that you are in a part of the jungles of Borneo where wild  Mohammedan tribes still exist, that you have had a strenuous day's  march, and it is time for you to halt and camp for the night. If you are  a thoughtful and experienced hunter you will pitch your camp where its  protection will be least difficult. A few wild men may severely punish  you for a lack of judgment in the matter. They may probably spring from  a weak and unexpected quarter when the occasion is least favorable for  you. And unless the members of your camp know that you have exercised  wise discretion, and that there are proper measures for their security,  they will be unable to obtain the needed repose for the following day's  work. From this we can see the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19560"],[0,"Applied Eugenics (#13)"],[1,"leads to the use of a  light wine or a malt liquor. (2) To gratify the palate. This again  usually results in the use of drinks of low alcohol content, in which  the flavor is the main consideration. (3) Finally, men drink \"to induce  those peculiar feelings, those peculiar frames of mind\" caused by  alcohol.    Although the three motives may and often do coexist in the same  individual, or may animate him at different periods of life, the fact  remains that they are quite distinct. Thirst and taste do not lead to  excessive drinking; and there is good evidence that the degree of  concentration and the dosage are important factors in the amount of harm  alcohol may do to the individual. The concern of evolutionists,  therefore, is with the man who is so constituted that the mental effects  of alcohol acting directly on the brain are pleasing, and we must show  that there is a congenital variability in this mental quality, among  individuals.    Surely an appeal to personal experience will leave little room for doubt  on that point. The alcohol question is so hedged about with moral and  ethical issues that those who never get drunk, or who perhaps never even  \"take a drink,\" are likely to ascribe that line of conduct to superior  intelligence and great self-control. As a fact, a dispassionate analysis  of the case will show that why many such do not use alcoholic beverages  to excess is because intoxication has no charm for them. He is so  constituted that the action of alcohol on the brain is distasteful  rather than pleasing to him. In other cases it is variation in  controlling satisfaction of immediate pleasures for later greater good.    Some of the real inebriates have a strong will and a real desire to be  sober, but have a different mental make-up, vividly described by William  James:[19] \"The craving for drink in real dipsomaniacs, or for opium and  chloral in those subjugated, is of a strength of which normal persons  can have no conception. 'Were a keg of rum in one corner of the room,  and were a cannon constantly discharging balls between me and it, I  could not refrain from passing before that cannon in order to get that  rum. If a bottle of brandy stood on one hand, and the pit of hell yawned  on the other, and I were convinced I should be pushed in as surely as I  took one glass, I could not refrain.' Such statements abound in  dipsomaniacs' mouths.\" Between this extreme, and the other of the man  who is sickened by a single glass of beer, there are all intermediates.    Now, given an abundant and accessible supply of alcohol to a race, what  happens? Those who are not tempted or have adequate control, do not  drink to excess; those who are so constituted as to crave the effects of  alcohol (once they have experienced them), and who lack the ability to  deny themselves the immediate pleasure for the sake of a future gain,  seek to renew these pleasures of intoxication at every opportunity; and  the well attested result is that they are likely to drink themselves to  a premature death.    Although it is a fact that the birth-rate in drunkard's families may be  and often is larger than that of the general population,[20] it is none  the less a fact that many of the worst drunkards leave no or few  offspring. They die of their own excesses at an early age; or their  conduct makes them unattractive as mates; or they give so little care to  their children that the latter die from neglect, exposure or accident.  As these drunkards would tend to hand down their own inborn peculiarity,  or weakness for alcohol, to their children, it must be obvious that  their death results in a smaller proportion of such persons in the next  generation. In other words, natural selection is at work again here,  with alcohol as its agent. By killing off the worst drunkards in each  generation, nature provides that the following generation shall contain  fewer people who lack the power to resist the attraction of the effect  of alcohol, or who have a tendency to use it to such an extent as to  injure their minds and bodies. And it must be obvious that the speed and  efficacy of this ruthless temperance reform movement are proportionate  to the abundance and accessibility of the supply of alcohol. Where the  supply is ample and available, there is certain to be a relatively high  death-rate among those who find it too attractive, and the average of  the race therefore is certain to become stronger in this respect with  each generation. Such a conclusion can be abundantly justified by an  appeal to the history of the Teutonic nations, the nations around the  Mediterranean, the Jews, or any race which has been submitted to the  test.    There seems hardly room for dispute on the reality of this phase of  natural selection. But there is another way in which the process of  strengthening the race against the attraction and effect of alcohol may  be going on at the same time. If the drug does actually injure the  germ-plasm, and set up a deterioriation, it is obvious that natural  selection is given another point at which to work. The more deteriorated  would be eliminated in each generation in competition with the less  deteriorated or normal; and the process of racial purification would  then go on the more rapidly. The fact that races long submitted to the  action of alcohol have become relatively resistant to it, therefore,  does not in itself answer the question of whether alcohol injures the  human germ-plasm.    The possible racial effect of alcoholization is, in short, a much more  complicated problem than it appears at first sight to be. It involves  the action of natural selection in several important ways, and this  action might easily mask the direct action of alcohol on the germ-plasm,  if there be any measurable direct result.    No longer content with a long perspective historical view, we will  scrutinize the direct investigations of the problem which have been made  during recent years. These investigations have in many cases been  widely advertised to the public, and their conclusions have been so much  repeated that they are often taken at their face value, without critical  examination.    It must be borne in mind that the solution of the problem depends on  finding evidence of degeneracy or impairment in the offspring of persons  who have used alcohol, and that this relation might be explainable in  one or more of three ways:    (1) It may be that alcoholism is merely a symptom of a degenerate stock.  In this case the children will be defective, not because their parents  drank, but because their parents were defective--the parents' drinking  being merely one of the symptoms of their defect.    (2) It may be that alcohol directly poisons the germ-plasm, in such a  way that parents of sound stock, who drink alcoholic beverages, will  have defective offspring.    (3) It may be that the degeneracy observed in the children of drunkards  (for of course no one will deny that children of drunkards are  frequently defective) is due solely to social and economic causes, or  other causes in the environment: that the drunken parents, for instance,  do not take adequate care of their children, and that this lack of care  leads to the defects of the children.    The latter influence is doubtless one that is nearly always at work, but  it is wholly outside the scope of the present inquiry, and we shall  therefore ignore it, save as it may appear incidentally. Nor does it  require emphasis here; for the disastrous social and economic effects of  alcoholism are patent to every observer. We find it most convenient to  concentrate our attention first on the second of the questions above  enumerated: to ask whether there is any good evidence that the use of  alcoholic beverages by men and women really does originate degeneracy in  their offspring.    To get such evidence, one must seek an instance that will be crucial,  one that will leave no room for other interpretations. One must,  therefore, exclude consideration of cases where a mother drank before  child birth. It is well-known that alcohol can pass through the  placenta, and that if a prospective mother drinks, the percentage of  alcohol in the circulation of the unborn child will very soon be nearly  equal to that in her own circulation. It is well established that such a  condition is extremely injurious to the child; but it has nothing  directly to do with heredity. Therefore we can not accept evidence of  the supposed effect of alcohol on the fertilized egg-cell, at any stage  in its development, because that is an effect on the individual, not on  posterity. And the only means by which we can wholly avoid this fallacy  is to give up altogether an attempt to prove our case by citing  instances in which the mother was alcoholic. If this is not done, there  will always be liability of mistaking an effect of prenatal nutrition  for a direct injury to the germ-plasm.    But if we can find cases where the mother was of perfectly sound stock,  and non-alcoholic; where the father was of sound stock, but alcoholic;  and where the offspring were impaired in ways that can be plausibly  attributed to an earlier injury to the germ-plasm by the father's  alcohol; then we have evidence that must weigh heavily with the  fair-minded.    An interesting case is the well-known one recorded by Schweighofer,  which is summarized as follows: \"A normal woman married a normal man and  had three sound children. The husband died and the woman married a  drunkard and gave birth to three other children; one of these became a  drunkard; one had infantilism, while the third was a social degenerate  and a drunkard. The first two of these children contracted tuberculosis,  which had never before been in the family. The woman married a third  time and by this sober husband again produced sound children.\"    Although such evidence is at first sight pertinent, it lacks much of  being"]]]
