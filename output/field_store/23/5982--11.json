Stammering Silvain owns, that they have gone astray in the mountains,  but that he is sure of their being found in due time.  While Thibaut  expresses his fear that they may be stolen by the fugitives, Rose  Friquet, an orphan-girl, brings the mules, riding on the back of one of  them.  Thibaut loads her with reproaches, but Silvain thanks her  warmly, and though she mockingly repudiates his thanks, he discovers  that she has taken the mules in order not to let the provost into  Silvain's secret.  The fact is that Silvain carries food every day to  the refugees, and Rose Friquet, the poor goat-keeper, who is despised  and supposed to be wicked and malicious, protects him in her poor way,  because he once intercepted a stone, which was meant for her head.    While the soldiers are dining, Belamy, who has found Georgette's  bonnet, demands an explanation.  {65} Thibaut, confused, finds a  pretext for going out, but Rose betrays to Belamy first the wine-cellar  and then Georgette's hiding-place.  The young wife cries for help and  Rose runs in to fetch Thibaut.  Belamy is delighted with the pretty  Georgette, but she tells him rather anxiously, that all the wives of  the village must needs remain entirely true to their husbands, for the  hermit of St. Gratien, though dead for two hundred years, is keeping  rigid watch, and betrays every case of infidelity by ringing a little  bell, which is heard far and wide.    Belamy is somewhat desirous to try the experiment with Georgette and  asks her to accompany him to the hermitage instead of her husband.    After having found the other women in the village, the soldiers, to  Thibaut's great vexation, decide to stay and amuse themselves.  Silvain  rejoices and after a secret sign from Rose resolves to warn the  refugees in the evening.    In the second act Rose and Silvain meet near St. Gratien.  Rose, after  telling him that all the paths are occupied by sentries, promises to  show him a way for the refugees, which she and her goat alone know.  Silvain, thanking her warmly, endeavours to induce her to care more for  her outward appearance, praising her pretty features.  Rose is  delighted to hear for the first time that she is pretty, and the duet  ensuing is one of the most charming things in the opera.  Silvain  promises to be her friend henceforth and then leaves, in order to seek  the Camisards.  After this Thibaut {66} appears, seeking his wife, whom  he has seen going away with Belamy.  Finding Rose he imagines he has  mistaken her for his wife, but she laughingly corrects him and he  proceeds to search for Georgette.  Belamy now comes and courts  Thibaut's wife.  But Rose, seeing them, resolves to free the path for  the others.--No sooner has Belamy tried to snatch a kiss from his  companion, than Rose draws the rope of the hermit's bell, and she  repeats the proceeding, until Georgette takes flight, while Thibaut  rushes up at the sound of the bell.  Belamy reassures him, intimating  that the bell may have rung for Rose (though it never rings for girls)  and accompanies him to the village.  But he soon returns to look for  the supposed hermit, who has played him this trick and finds Rose  instead, who does not perceive him.--To his great surprise Silvain  comes up with the whole troop of refugees, leading the aged clergyman,  who had been a father to him in his childhood.  Silvain presents Rose  to them as their deliverer and vows to make her his wife.--Rose leads  them to the secret path, while Silvain returns to the village, leaving  Belamy triumphant at his discovery.    In the third act we find the people on the following morning speaking  of nothing but Silvain's wedding with Rose and of the hermit's bell.  Nobody knows who has been the culprit, but Thibaut slily calculates  that the hermit has rung before-hand, when Rose the bride kissed the  dragoon.  Having learned that the soldiers had been commanded to {67}  saddle their horses in the midst of the dancing the night before, and  that Belamy, sure of his prey, has come back, he believes that Rose has  betrayed the poor Camisards in order to win the price set on their  heads and this opinion he now communicates to Silvain.    To keep Belamy away from Georgette, the sly Squire has conducted him to  the wine-cellar, and the officier [Transcriber's note: officer?], now  half-drunk admits having had a rendez-vous with Rose.--When Thibaut has  retired, Belamy again kisses Georgette, and lo, the bell does not ring  this time!    Meanwhile Rose comes down the hill, neatly clad and glowing with joy  and pride and Georgette disregarding Thibaut's reproofs offers her the  wedding-garland.  The whole village is assembled to see the wedding,  but Silvain appears with dark brow and when Rose radiantly greets him,  he pushes her back fiercely, believing that she betrayed the refugees,  who are, as he has heard, caught.  Rose is too proud to defend herself,  but when Georgette tries to console her, she silently draws from her  bosom a paper, containing the information that the refugees have safely  crossed the frontier.--Great is Silvain's shame and heartfelt his  repentance.--Suddenly Belamy enters, beside himself with rage, for his  prey has escaped and he has lost his patent as lieutenant together with  the remuneration of 200 pistoles, and he at once orders Silvain to be  shot.  But Rose bravely defends her lover, threatening to reveal the  dragoon's neglect of duty.  {68} When therefore Belamy's superior  appears to hear the important news of which the messenger told him, his  corporal is only able to stammer out that nothing in particular has  happened, and so after all, Georgette is saved from discovery and Rose  becomes Silvain's happy bride.          THE DUSK OF THE GODS.    Third day of the Nibelungen Ring by WAGNER.      This is the end of the great and beautiful tragedy and really it may be  called both a sublime and grand conclusion, which unites once again all  the dramatic and musical elements of the whole and presents to us a  picture the more interesting and touching, as it is now purely human.  The Gods who, though filled with passions and faults like mortals,  never can be for us living persons, fall into the background, and human  beings, full of high aspirations, take their places.  The long and  terrible conflict between the power of gold and that of love is at last  fought out and love conquers.    In the Dusk of the Gods we see again the curse, which lies on gold, and  the sacred benediction of true love.  Can there be anything more noble,  more touching, than Bruennhilde's mourning for Siegfried and the grand  sacrifice of herself in expiation of her error?    The third day opens with a prelude, in which we see three Norns,  weaving world's fate.  When the cord breaks, they fly; the dawn of  another world is upon them.    {69}    In the first act Siegfried bids Bruennhilde fare well.  His active soul  thirsts for deeds, and Bruennhilde having taught him all she knows does  not detain him.  He gives her the fatal ring in token of remembrance,  confiding her to the care of Loge.  Then we are transported to the  Gibichung's hall on the Rhine.  Gunther and his sister Gutrune sit  there, together with their gloomy half-brother Hagen.  The latter  advises his brother to marry, telling him of the beautiful woman,  guarded by the flames.  When he has sufficiently excited Gunther's  longing, he suggests that, as Siegfried is the only one able to gain  Bruennhilde, Gunther should attach him to his person by giving him  Gutrune as wife.  This is to be achieved by a draught, which has the  power of causing oblivion.  Whoever drinks it forgets that ever a woman  has existed beside the one, who has tended the potion.  Hagen well  knows of Siegfried's union with Bruennhilde, but Gunther and Gutrune are  both ignorant of it.    Siegfried arrives and is heartily welcomed.  All turns out as Hagen has  foretold.  By the fatal potion Siegfried falls passionately in love  with Gutrune, so that he completely forgets Bruennhilde.  He swears  blood-brothership to Gunther, and promises to win Bruennhilde for him.  Then the two depart on their errand.    Meanwhile the Walkyrie Waltraute comes to Bruennhilde and beseeches her  to render Siegfried's ring to the Rhine-daughters, in order to save the  Gods from destruction.  Bruennhilde refuses to part {70} with the token  of her husband's love, and hardly has Waltraute departed, than fate  overtakes her in the person of Siegfried, who ventures through the  flames in Gunther's shape.  She vainly struggles against him, he  snatches the ring from her, and so she is conquered.  Siegfried holds  vigil through the night, his sword separating him and the woman he  wooed, and in the early dawn he leads her away to her bridegroom, who  takes Siegfried's place unawares.    In the second act Alberich appears to Hagen.  He tells his son of the  story of the ring and bids him kill Siegfried and recover the stolen  treasure for its owner.--Siegfried appears, announcing Gunther's and  Bruennhilde's arrival.  The bridal pair is received by all their men,  but the joy is soon damped by Bruennhilde recognizing in the bridegroom  of Gutrune her own husband.  Siegfried does not know her, but she  discovers her ring on his hand, and asserting that Gunther won it from  her, this hero is obliged to acknowledge the shameful role he  played.--Though Siegfried swears that his sword Nothung guarded him  from any contact with Gunther's bride, Bruennhilde responds in a most  startling manner, and both swear on Hagen's spear that it may pierce  them, should their words prove false.  All this makes a dreadful  impression on the weak mind of Gunther.    When Siegfried has withdrawn in high spirits with his bride Gutrune,  Hagen hoping to gain the ring offers to avenge Bruennhilde on the  faithless {71}"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2465"],[0,"Carmen (#13)"],[1,"money by performing  dances strongly resembling those forbidden at our public balls in  carnival time. An English missionary, Mr. Borrow, the author of two very  interesting works on the Spanish gipsies, whom he undertook to convert  on behalf of the Bible Society, declares there is no instance of any  gitana showing the smallest weakness for a man not belonging to her  own race. The praise he bestows upon their chastity strikes me as being  exceedingly exaggerated. In the first place, the great majority are  in the position of the ugly woman described by Ovid, \"_Casta quam nemo  rogavit_.\" As for the pretty ones, they are, like all Spanish women,  very fastidious in choosing their lovers. Their fancy must be taken,  and their favour must be earned. Mr. Borrow quotes, in proof of their  virtue, one trait which does honour to his own, and especially to his  simplicity: he declares that an immoral man of his acquaintance offered  several gold ounces to a pretty gitana, and offered them in vain. An  Andalusian, to whom I retailed this anecdote, asserted that the immoral  man in question would have been far more successful if he had shown the  girl two or three piastres, and that to offer gold ounces to a gipsy was  as poor a method of persuasion as to promise a couple of millions to a  tavern wench. However that may be, it is certain that the gitana shows  the most extraordinary devotion to her husband. There is no danger and  no suffering she will not brave, to help him in his need. One of the  names which the gipsies apply to themselves, _Rome_, or \"the married  couple,\" seems to me a proof of their racial respect for the married  state. Speaking generally, it may be asserted that their chief virtue is  their patriotism--if we may thus describe the fidelity they observe in  all their relations with persons of the same origin as their own, their  readiness to help one another, and the inviolable secrecy which they  keep for each other's benefit, in all compromising matters. And indeed  something of the same sort may be noticed in all mysterious associations  which are beyond the pale of the law.         * It has struck me that the German gipsies, though they       thoroughly understand the word _cale_, do not care to be       called by that name. Among themselves they always use the       designation _Romane tchave_.    Some months ago, I paid a visit to a gipsy tribe in the Vosges country.  In the hut of an old woman, the oldest member of the tribe, I found  a gipsy, in no way related to the family, who was sick of a mortal  disease. The man had left a hospital, where he was well cared for, so  that he might die among his own people. For thirteen weeks he had been  lying in bed in their encampment, and receiving far better treatment  than any of the sons and sons-in-law who shared his shelter. He had a  good bed made of straw and moss, and sheets that were tolerably white,  whereas all the rest of the family, which numbered eleven persons, slept  on planks three feet long. So much for their hospitality. This very same  woman, humane as was her treatment of her guest said to me constantly  before the sick man: \"_Singo, singo, homte hi mulo_.\" \"Soon, soon he  must die!\" After all, these people live such miserable lives, that a  reference to the approach of death can have no terrors for them.    One remarkable feature in the gipsy character is their indifference  about religion. Not that they are strong-minded or sceptical. They  have never made any profession of atheism. Far from that, indeed, the  religion of the country which they inhabit is always theirs; but they  change their religion when they change the country of their residence.  They are equally free from the superstitions which replace religious  feeling in the minds of the vulgar. How, indeed, can superstition exist  among a race which, as a rule, makes its livelihood out of the credulity  of others? Nevertheless, I have remarked a particular horror of touching  a corpse among the Spanish gipsies. Very few of these could be induced  to carry a dead man to his grave, even if they were paid for it.    I have said that most gipsy women undertake to tell fortunes. They do  this very successfully. But they find a much greater source of profit  in the sale of charms and love-philters. Not only do they supply toads'  claws to hold fickle hearts, and powdered loadstone to kindle love in  cold ones, but if necessity arises, they can use mighty incantations,  which force the devil to lend them his aid. Last year the following  story was related to me by a Spanish lady. She was walking one day along  the _Calle d'Alcala_, feeling very sad and anxious. A gipsy woman who  was squatting on the pavement called out to her, \"My pretty lady, your  lover has played you false!\" (It was quite true.) \"Shall I get him  back for you?\" My readers will imagine with what joy the proposal was  accepted, and how complete was the confidence inspired by a person who  could thus guess the inmost secrets of the heart. As it would have been  impossible to proceed to perform the operations of magic in the most  crowded street in Madrid, a meeting was arranged for the next day.  \"Nothing will be easier than to bring back the faithless one to your  feet!\" said the gitana. \"Do you happen to have a handkerchief, a scarf,  or a mantilla, that he gave you?\" A silken scarf was handed her. \"Now  sew a piastre into one corner of the scarf with crimson silk--sew half  a piastre into another corner--sew a peseta here--and a two-real piece  there; then, in the middle you must sew a gold coin--a doubloon would be  best.\" The doubloon and all the other coins were duly sewn in. \"Now give  me the scarf, and I'll take it to the Campo Santo when midnight strikes.  You come along with me, if you want to see a fine piece of witchcraft.  I promise you shall see the man you love to-morrow!\" The gipsy departed  alone for the Campo Santo, since my Spanish friend was too much afraid  of witchcraft to go there with her. I leave my readers to guess whether  my poor forsaken lady ever saw her lover, or her scarf, again.    In spite of their poverty and the sort of aversion they inspire, the  gipsies are treated with a certain amount of consideration by the more  ignorant folk, and they are very proud of it. They feel themselves to be  a superior race as regards intelligence, and they heartily despise the  people whose hospitality they enjoy. \"These Gentiles are so stupid,\"  said one of the Vosges gipsies to me, \"that there is no credit in taking  them in. The other day a peasant woman called out to me in the street.  I went into her house. Her stove smoked and she asked me to give her a  charm to cure it. First of all I made her give me a good bit of bacon,  and then I began to mumble a few words in _Romany_. 'You're a fool,' I  said, 'you were born a fool, and you'll die a fool!' When I had got near  the door I said to her, in good German, 'The most certain way of keeping  your stove from smoking is not to light any fire in it!' and then I took  to my heels.\"    The history of the gipsies is still a problem. We know, indeed, that  their first bands, which were few and far between, appeared in Eastern  Europe towards the beginning of the fifteenth century. But nobody can  tell whence they started, or why they came to Europe, and, what is still  more extraordinary, no one knows how they multiplied, within a short  time, and in so prodigious a fashion, and in several countries, all  very remote from each other. The gipsies themselves have preserved no  tradition whatsoever as to their origin, and though most of them do  speak of Egypt as their original fatherland, that is only because they  have adopted a very ancient fable respecting their race.    Most of the Orientalists who have studied the gipsy language believe  that the cradle of the race was in India. It appears, in fact, that  many of the roots and grammatical forms of the _Romany_ tongue are to  be found in idioms derived from the Sanskrit. As may be imagined, the  gipsies, during their long wanderings, have adopted many foreign words.  In every _Romany_ dialect a number of Greek words appear.    At the present day the gipsies have almost as many dialects as there are  separate hordes of their race. Everywhere, they speak the language of  the country they inhabit more easily than their own idiom, which  they seldom use, except with the object of conversing freely before  strangers. A comparison of the dialect of the German gipsies with that  used by the Spanish gipsies, who have held no communication with each  other for several centuries, reveals the existence of a great number of  words common to both. But everywhere the original language is notably  affected, though in different degrees, by its contact with the more  cultivated languages into the use of which the nomads have been forced.  German in one case and Spanish in the other have so modified the  _Romany_ groundwork that it would not be possible for a gipsy from the  Black Forest to converse with one of his Andalusian brothers, although a  few sentences on each side would suffice to convince them that each was  speaking a dialect of the same language. Certain words in very frequent  use are, I believe, common to every dialect. Thus, in every vocabulary  which I have been able to consult, _pani_ means water, _manro_ means  bread, _mas_ stands for meat, and _lon_ for salt.    The nouns of number are almost the same in every case. The German  dialect seems to me much purer than the Spanish, for it has preserved  numbers of the primitive grammatical forms, whereas the Gitanos have  adopted those of the Castilian tongue. Nevertheless, some words are an  exception, as though to prove that the language was originally common  to all. The preterite of the German dialect is formed by adding _ium_  to the imperative, which is always the root of the verb. In the  Spanish _Romany_ the verbs are all"]]]
