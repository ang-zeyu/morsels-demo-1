Lieutenant-Colonel von Krusemark was accompanied by a single footman  only, whom he had taken into his service for this special purpose, and  who had been warmly recommended to him. During the whole journey the  colonel kept the dispatches on his bare breast. It was only when he had  arrived at St. Petersburg that he laid them for a little while upon the  table, in order to change his dress, and deliver them immediately to the  czar. The servant was engaged in arranging his clothes. M. von Krusemark  went for a minute into an adjoining room, and when he returned, the  footman had disappeared with the dispatches. All the efforts made by  Krusemark and the police to recover the important papers were fruitless.  They found neither them nor the servant. Krusemark, therefore, had to  send a courier to Berlin, and ask for new instructions. This caused a  delay of several weeks, in consequence of which the Russian army was  unable to be here in time to join our troops and assist them in  attacking the French. We would not have lost the battle of Jena, if the  king's dispatches had been delivered to the Emperor of Russia at an  earlier moment, and if his army had set out in time for the seat of war.  We would not have lost the battle, if the dispatches had not been  stolen. Now listen to what I am going to tell you: _That footman had  been recommended by Lombard to Lieutenant-Colonel von Krusemark, and was  a near relative of the former_!\"    \"He is a traitor!\" cried the people, \"it is his fault that we lost the  battle of Jena! But he shall atone for it! Woe to the traitor!\"    \"Oh, your majesty!\" exclaimed Madame von Berg, in terror, \"just see! the  furious men are dragging him from his chair. They will assassinate him.  Have mercy on him and save his life!\"    \"Yes,\" said the queen, stepping back from the window, \"yes, I will  protect him, but I will also protect myself.\"    And hurrying across the apartment, she opened the door of the anteroom,  where the major of the garrison of Stettin and a few staff-officers were  assembled.    \"Major,\" said she, in a commanding voice, \"hasten down-stairs, and  arrest Cabinet-Counsellor Lombard. Take him to the guard-house, where  you will detain him until the king sends you further orders. I will  report in person to his majesty what I commanded you to do.\"    It was high time to interfere, in order to save Lombard's life. The  enraged people had already thrown him down, and, regardless of the  supplications of the two merchants, commenced belaboring him  unmercifully, when the major appeared with a few soldiers and police  officers.    \"Order! order!\" he called in a loud voice. \"Order, in the name of the  queen!\"    The noise immediately died away; and those who had already seized  Lombard turned around and stepped respectfully aside to let the major  pass.    \"In the name of the queen,\" he repeated, placing his hand on Lombard's  shoulder, and assisting him to rise, \"I arrest you, Cabinet-Counsellor  Lombard! You will accompany me to the guard-house.\"    But Lombard, unable to stand, had sunk down on the chair, half dead with  terror.    \"You see, sir, I am unable to accompany you,\" he groaned, faintly, \"I  cannot walk.\"    \"My soldiers will carry you, then,\" said the major; making a sign to  them, he added, \"Take the prisoner in your arms, and carry him to the  guard-house.\"    Amid the loud applause of the crowd the order was immediately obeyed.  The soldiers seized Lombard, and started off with him. A large number  followed, laughing and deriding him, and congratulating each other that  their queen would now be able to continue her journey uninterruptedly,  as the traitor had been arrested.    After reaching the guard-house, M. Lombard was locked up in one of the  common cells, but the major dared not condemn the influential and  powerful friend of Minister von Haugwitz to lie on the hard bench of the  criminals, and to eat the ordinary prisoner's fare. He, therefore, sent  to the first hotel in Stettin, and requested the landlord to furnish  Lombard with bedding and food, and to send both immediately. But the  soldiers returned without having obtained either one or the other.    \"Well, will the landlord send the articles?\" asked the major.    \"No, sir,\" was the reply; \"the landlord declined doing so. He said, he  would not furnish a traitor with any thing, no matter what price he  offered him.\"    The major tried in vain to look angry. The reply pleased him just as  much as the chastisement inflicted on Lombard by the people had pleased  him previously.    \"Then go to another landlord,\" he said, \"and make the same request of  him. If he should also decline complying with it, go to a third. In  short, go and find a landlord who is willing to send bedding and food to  Cabinet-Counsellor Lombard.\"    The people, who had gathered in front of the guard-house, heard the  words of the soldiers as well as the renewed order of the major, and  accompanied them to find a landlord willing to furnish bedding and food  for the traitor.    An hour elapsed before they returned, still accompanied by the crowd,  whose numbers had vastly increased. The major was in Lombard's cell, and  had left orders for the soldiers to report to him there. He anticipated,  perhaps, the answer they would bring back to him, and wished the  prisoner to hear it.    He who had hitherto sat at tables laden with delicacies and slept only  on silken beds--the epicurean and sensual spendthrift--lay on the hard  wooden bench, groaning with pain and terror, when the soldiers entered  his cell. The major stood at the window, and drummed on the panes.    \"Well,\" he said, \"do you at length come, and bring bedding and food for  M. Lombard? But why did you tarry so long, you lazy fellows? Did you not  know that until your return he would have to lie on the bench here like  a common felon?\"    \"We could not return at an earlier time, sir,\" replied they. \"We have  gone from hotel to hotel; we have informed all the landlords in Stettin  of your orders, and requested them to furnish Cabinet-Counsellor Lombard  with bedding and food. But all of them made the same reply--all of them  answered: 'Tell the major that I shall not comply with his orders. I  will not furnish a traitor with any thing!'\"    \"Oh!\" groaned Lombard; \"then they want me to die with my sick, bruised  body on the hard boards here!\"    \"No!\" exclaimed the major, \"I will obtain another couch for you. I will  immediately go to the governor and procure an order from him that will  compel the hotel-keepers to furnish you with the necessary articles.\"    Half an hour afterward he returned to Lombard, who had meanwhile vainly  tried to sleep.    \"Now, sir,\" said the major, \"your wishes will soon be fulfilled. The  governor has ordered the proprietor of the hotel _Zum Kronprinzen_,  under pain of severe punishment, to furnish you with all necessaries,  and I have sent some of my men to him with this written order. They will  doubtless speedily return.\"    A few minutes later, in fact, the door opened, and the soldiers carried  a bed into the cell; two others followed with smoking dishes.    \"Well,\" said the major, \"then the landlord of the hotel that I sent you  to has no longer refused to give you the required articles? The  governor's order had a good effect.\"    \"Yes, sir, it had a good effect. But the proprietor of the hotel _Zum  Kronprinzen_ sends word to you, that inasmuch as the governor had issued  so stringent an order, nothing remained for him but to obey; but as soon  as he should be compelled no longer to furnish M. Lombard with any  thing, he would smash the dishes and plates from which the cabinet  counsellor had eaten, and burn the bedding on which he had slept.\"    M. Lombard had apparently not heard these mortifying words. Assisted by  his footman, who had been sent for, he hastily rose, and sat down at the  table to dinner.    In the evening the major repaired with a few officers to the hotel, and  inquired for the landord.    He came in, somewhat confused, and convinced that the major would  censure him for his conduct. The latter, however, went to meet him, and,  with a kindly smile, offered him his hand. \"Sir,\" he said, \"these  gentlemen and I have taken it upon ourselves to express to you, in the  name of all our comrades, our delight at the brave and manly reply you  made to-day, when compelled to furnish Lombard, the traitor, with food  and bedding. The officers of the garrison have resolved to board with  you, for we deem it an honor to be the guests of so patriotic a man.\"          CHAPTER VII.    THE QUEEN'S FLIGHT.      Louisa waited till Lombard had been carried away amid the jeers of the  people; then, accompanied by her friend, she hastened down-stairs in  order to continue her journey. Many persons were still assembled in the  street, who, instead of following Lombard, had preferred to see the  queen once more. They received her with enthusiastic cheers, and  heartily wished her a safe journey.    \"Give our best wishes to our king, and tell him that we will be faithful  to him as long as we live!\" exclaimed a voice from the crowd.    \"We thank the queen for ordering the traitor to be arrested!\" exclaimed  another. \"Now we need not have any fears for her, and know that she is  able to continue her journey without incurring any danger whatever.\"    Louisa greeted her subjects smilingly, and lowered the windows of the  carriage for the purpose of returning their salutations, and of being  seen by them.    \"Yes,\" she said, when the carriage rolled through the gate into the  high-road, \"yes, I hope the prophecy of these good men will be  fulfilled, and that I shall safely reach my destination. Now that  Lombard has been arrested, I am satisfied of it, for he had followed me  in order to inform the enemy of my whereabouts; I feel convinced of it.  But the judgment of Heaven has overtaken him, and he has received his  punishment."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],[0,"The Pirates' Who's Who (#13)"],[1,"pirate.  Out of his very first prize, an Indiaman, which he boarded off the Mersey,  he took a sum of L40,000, and then scuttled the ship and drowned the crew.    Cobham, calling in at Plymouth, met a damsel called Maria, whom he took on  board with him, which at first caused some murmuring amongst his crew, who  were jealous because they themselves were not able to take lady companions  with them on their voyages, for, as the same biographer sagely remarks,  \"where a man is married the case is altered, no man envies him his  happiness; but where he only keeps a girl, every man says, 'I have as much  right to one as he has.'\" Nevertheless, Maria proved herself a great  success, for when any member of the crew was to be punished Maria would  use her influence with the captain to get him excused or his punishment  lessened, thus winning the affection of all on board. The English Channel  becoming too dangerous for Cobham, he sailed across the Atlantic and lay  in wait for vessels between Cape Breton and Prince Edward Isle, and took  several prizes. In one of these he placed all the crew in sacks and threw  them into the sea. Maria, too, took her part in these affairs, and once  stabbed to the heart, with her own little dirk, the captain of a Liverpool  brig, the _Lion_, and on another occasion, to indulge her whim, a captain  and his two mates were tied up to the windlass while Maria shot them with  her pistol. Maria always wore naval uniform, both at sea and when in port;  in fact, she entered thoroughly into the spirit of the enterprise.    Cobham now wished to retire from the sea, but Maria urged him to further  efforts, as she had set her heart on his buying her a beautiful place in  England called Mapleton Hall, near Poole.    Maria's last act at sea was to poison the whole crew of an Indiaman, who  were prisoners in irons aboard the pirate ship.    Cobham having made a vast fortune, at last decided to settle down, and he  bought a large estate near Havre from the Duc de Chartres. It was on the  coast, and had a snug little harbour of its own, where the retired pirate  kept a small pleasure yacht in which he and Maria used to go for fishing  expeditions. One day, when they were out on one of these picnics, a West  India brig lay becalmed near by, and Cobham and his crew went on board to  visit the captain of the merchant ship. But the temptation proved too  strong, and Cobham suddenly shooting the captain, Maria and the yacht's  crew quickly despatched the rest. Carrying the prize to Bordeaux, he sold  her for a good price. This was Cobham's last act of piracy, and soon  afterwards he was made a magistrate, and presided at the county courts.  Maria, it was thought, possibly owing to remorse, poisoned herself with  laudanum and died. Cobham lived to a good old age, and eventually passed  away, leaving many descendants, who, a hundred years ago, \"were moving in  the first grade at Havre.\"      COBHAM, MRS. MARIA.    A bloodthirsty and ambitious woman pirate, the wife of Captain Cobham,  late of Poole in Dorset.      COCKLYN, CAPTAIN THOMAS.    In 1717 was in the Bahama Islands when Woodes Rogers arrived at New  Providence Island with King George's offer of pardon to those pirates who  came in and surrendered themselves. Cocklyn, like many others, after  surrendering, fell again into their wicked ways, and ended by being  hanged. Only a year after receiving the royal pardon we hear of him being  in company with Davis and La Bouse and several other notorious pirates at  Sierra Leone, when he was in command of a tall ship of twenty-four guns.    Cocklyn ended his life on the gallows.      COFRECINA, CAPTAIN.    A notorious Spanish-American pirate who was very troublesome in the South  Atlantic in the early part of the last century. Eventually captured by  Midshipman Hull Foot of the U.S. Navy in March, 1825, at St. Thomas Isle.  Executed in Porto Rico by the terrible Spanish method of the garotte.      COLE, CAPTAIN JOHN.    Commander of the _Eagle_, _alias_ the _New York Revenge's Revenge_. Tried,  condemned, and hanged in 1718 at Charleston. His was a brilliant career  while it lasted, but was cut short after a brief and meteoric spell.      COLE, SAMUEL.    One of Captain Fly's crew. Tried and condemned for piracy at Boston in  1726. On the way to the gallows the culprits were taken to church, where  they had to listen to a long sermon from Dr. Colman, bringing home to the  wretched creatures their dreadful sins and their awful future.      COLLIER, CAPTAIN EDWARD.    Commanded the _Oxford_, a King's ship, which was sent from England to  Jamaica at the earnest request of Governor Modyford, for a \"nimble  frigate,\" to help keep control over the increasingly turbulent buccaneers.  Collier's first act was to seize a French man-of-war, a privateer called  the _Cour Volent_, of La Rochelle, commanded by M. la Vivon, his excuse  being that the Frenchmen had robbed an English vessel of provisions.  Collier was appointed to be Morgan's Vice-Admiral, and a few days later  the _Oxford_ was blown up accidentally while a conference of buccaneer  captains was taking place.    In 1670, with six ships and 400 men, the buccaneers sailed for the Spanish  Main and sacked the city of Rio de la Hacha. Collier led the left wing in  the famous and successful attack on Panama City with the rank of colonel.    Richard Brown reports that Collier could on occasions be very cruel, and  that he even executed a Spanish friar on the battlefield after quarter had  been given to the vanquished. On their return to the coast after the  sacking of Panama, Collier was accused, with Morgan and the other  commanders, of having cheated the seamen of their fair share of the  plunder, and of deserting them, and then sailing off in the ships with the  supplies of food as well as the plunder.      COLLINS, THOMAS.    This Madagascar pirate was a carpenter by trade, who had by 1716 retired  from the sea and lived in splendour in that island. Collins was made  Governor of the pirate colony, and built a small fort for its defence,  which the pirates armed with the guns taken out of their ship, which had  by long use grown old and crazy, and was of no further use to them.      COMRY, ADAM.    Surgeon to the ship _Elizabeth_, taken by Captain Bartholomew Roberts's  squadron. Gave evidence at the trial of George Wilson and another  sea-surgeon, Scudamore, that the former had borrowed from Comry a \"clean  shirt and drawers, for his better appearance and reception.\" When visiting  Captain Bartholomew Roberts's ship, Comry was forced to serve as surgeon  on board one of Roberts's vessels.      CONDENT, CAPTAIN, _also_ CONGDON or CONDEN.    Born at Plymouth in Devonshire.    Condent was quartermaster in a New York sloop, at the Island of New  Providence, when Governor Woodes Rogers arrived there in 1718. The captain  of the sloop seems to have thought best to leave rather than wait to  welcome the new Governor. When only a few days out, one of the crew, an  Indian, who had been cruelly treated, attempted, in revenge, to blow up  the ship. This was prevented by Condent, who with great courage leapt into  the hold and shot the Indian, but not before the latter had fired at him  and broken his arm. The crew, to show the relief they felt at being saved  from a sudden death, hacked to pieces the body of the Indian, while the  gunner, ripping open the dead man's belly, tore out his heart, which he  boiled and ate.    Turning their attention from cannibalism to piracy, the pirates took a  prize, the _Duke of York_, but disputes arising, the captain and part of  the crew sailed in the prize, while Condent was elected captain of the  sloop, and headed across the Atlantic for the Cape Verde Islands, where he  found the salt fleet, of twenty small vessels, lying at anchor off the  Island of Mayo, all of which he took. Sailing next to the Island of St.  Jago, he took a Dutch ship. This proving a better ship than the sloop,  Condent transferred himself and crew into her, and named her the _Flying  Dragon_, presenting the sloop to the mate of an English prize, who he had  forced to go with him. From thence Condent sailed away for the coast of  Brazil, taking several Portuguese ships which, after plundering, he let  go. After cleaning the _Flying Dragon_ on Ferdinando Island, the pirates  took several more prizes, and then one day met with a Portuguese  man-of-war of seventy guns. Coming up with her, the Portuguese hailed the  pirates, and they answered \"from London bound for Buenos Ayres.\" The  man-of-war, to pay a compliment to the ship of her English ally, manned  the shrouds and cheered him, and while this amicable demonstration of  marine brotherly feeling was taking place, Captain Condent came up  alongside and suddenly fired a broadside and a volley of small arms into  the man-of-war, and a smart engagement followed, in which the pirates were  worsted, and were lucky to escape.    Sailing away round the Cape of Good Hope, Condent arrived at the pirate  stronghold at the Island of Johanna, where he took on board some of  Captain Halsey's crew, and, reinforced by these skilled masters in the  craft of piracy, took several rich East Indiamen off the Malabar coast.    Calling in at the Isle of St. Mary, one of the Mascerenas group, he met  with another Portuguese ship of seventy guns, which he was fortunate  enough to make a prize of. In this ship they found amongst the passengers  the Viceroy of Goa. Carrying this rich prize to Zanzibar, they plundered  her of a large amount of money.    Having now gathered a vast fortune, they thought it time to give up  piracy, so they returned to the Island of St. Mary, where they made a  share of their plunder, and the company broke up, many of them settling  down amongst the natives. Captain Condent and some others sent from here a  petition to the Governor of Mauritius asking for a pardon, and received  answer that he would"]]]
