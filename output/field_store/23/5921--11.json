He tried the spark and found that by touching the wire to the top of  the cylinder, when the proper connection was, made, that he had a hot,  \"fat one.\"  The compression seemed all right and the supply pipe from  the gasoline tank was in perfect order.  Still the motor would not go.  No explosion resulted when he turned the flywheel over, not even when  he primed the cylinder by putting a little gasoline in through the  cocks on the cylinder heads.    \"That's funny,\" he remarked to himself as he rested from his labors and  contemplated the \"dead\" motor.  \"First time it has gone back on me.\"  The boat was drifting down the lake, and, at the sound of another motor  craft approaching, Tom looked up.  He saw the RED STREAK, containing  Andy Foger and his cronies.  They had observed the young inventor's  plight.    \"Want a tow?\"  sneered Andy.    \"What'll you take for your second-hand boat that won't run?\" asked Pete  Bailey.    \"Better get out of the way or you might be run down,\" added Sam  Snedecker.    Tom was too angry and chagrined to reply, and the RED STREAK swept on.    \"I'll make her go, if it takes all night!\" declared Tom energetically.  Once more he tried to start the motor.  It coughed and sighed, as if in  protest, but would not explode.  Then Tom cried: \"The spark plug!  That's where the trouble is, I'll wager.  Why didn't I think of it  before?\"    It was the work of but a minute to unscrew the spark plugs from the  tops of the cylinders.  He found that both had such accumulations of  carbon on them that no spark could ever have reached the mixture of  gasoline and air.    \"I'll put new ones in,\" he decided, for he carried a few spare plugs  for emergencies.  Inside of five minutes, with the new plugs in place,  the motor was running better than before.    \"Now for home!\"  cried Tom, \"and if I meet Andy Foger I'll race him  this time.\"    But the RED STREAK was not in sight, and, a little later, Tom had run  the ARROW into the boathouse, locked the door and was on his way up to  the mansion.    \"I suppose Mrs. Baggert and Garret will be surprised to see me,\" he  remarked.  \"Maybe they'll think we don't trust them, by coming back in  this fashion to see that everything is safe.  But then, I suppose, dad  is naturally nervous about some of his valuable machinery and  inventions.  I think I'll find everything all right, though.\"    As Tom went up the main path and swung off to a side one, which was a  short cut to the house, he saw in the dusk, for it was now early  evening, a movement in the bushes that lined the walk.    \"Hello, Garret!\"  exclaimed the lad, taking it for granted it was the  engineer employed by Mr. Swift.    There was no reply, and Tom, with a sudden suspicion, sprang toward the  bushes.  The shrubbery was more violently agitated and, as the lad  reached the screen of foliage, he saw a man spring up from the ground  and take to his heels.    \"Here!  Who are you?  What do you want?\"  yelled Tom.    Hardly had he spoken when from behind a big apple tree another man  sprung.  It was light enough so that the lad could see his face, and a  glimpse of it caused him to cry out:    \"Happy Harry, the tramp!\"    Before he could call again the two men had disappeared.          CHAPTER XIII    TOM IN DANGER      \"Garret!  Garret Jackson!\" cried Tom as he struggled through the hedge  of bushes and ran after the men.  \"Where are you, Garret?  Come on and  help me chase these men!\"    But there came no answer to Tom's hail.  He could not hear the sound of  the retreating footsteps of the men now and concluded that they had  made their escape.  Still he would not give up, but dashed on, slipping  and stumbling, now and then colliding with a tree.    \"What can they be doing here?\" thought Tom in great anxiety.  \"Are they  after some more of dad's inventions because they didn't get his turbine  motor?\"    \"Hello!  Who's there?  Who are you?\" called a voice suddenly.    \"Oh, Garret!  Where have you been?\" asked the young inventor,  recognizing the tones of his father's keeper.  \"I've been calling you.  Some of those scoundrels are around again!\"    \"Why if it isn't Tom!\" ejaculated the engineer.  \"However in the world  did you get here?  I thought you were at Sandport.\"    \"I'll explain later, Garret.  Just now I want to catch those men, if I  can.\"    \"Which men?\"    \"Happy Harry and another one.  I saw them hiding down by the orchard  path.  Come on, they're right ahead of us.\"    But though they hunted as well as they were able to in the  fast-gathering darkness, there was no trace of the intruders.  They had  to give up, and Tom, after going to the boathouse to see that the ARROW  was all right, returned to the house, where he told the engineer and  housekeeper what had brought him back and how he had surprised the two  men.    \"Is everything all right, Garret?\" he concluded.  \"Dad is nervous and  frightened.  I must telephone him at the hotel to-night and let him  know, for I promised to come back.  I can't, though, until to-morrow.\"    \"Everything is all right as far as I know,\" answered Jackson.  \"I've  kept a careful watch and the burglar alarm has been in working order.  Mrs. Baggert and I haven't been disturbed a single night since you went  away.  It's curious that the men should be here the very night you come  back.  Maybe they followed you.\"    \"I hardly think so, for they didn't know I was coming.\"    \"You can't tell what those fellows know,\" commented the engineer.  \"But, anyhow, I don't suppose they could have gotten here from Sandport  as soon as you did.\"    \"Oh, yes they could, in their automobile,\" declared Tom.  \"But I don't  believe they knew I was coming.  They knew we were away, however, and  thought it would be a good time to steal something, I guess.  Are you  sure nothing has been taken?\"    \"Perfectly sure, but you and I will take a look around the shop.\"    They made a hasty examination, but found nothing disturbed and no signs  that anyone had tried to break in.    \"I think I'll telephone dad that everything is all right,\" decided Tom.  \"It is as far as his inventions are concerned, and if I tell about  seeing the men it will only worry him.  I can explain that part better  when I see him.  But when I go back, Garret, you will have to be on  your guard, since those men are in the neighborhood.\"    \"I will, Tom.  Don't worry.\"    Mr. Swift was soon informed by his son over the telephone that nothing  in the shops had been disturbed, and the inventor received the news  with evident satisfaction.  He requested Tom to come back to the hotel  in the morning, in order that the three of them might go for a ride  about the lake in the afternoon, and Tom decided to make an early start.    The night passed without incident, though Tom, who kept the gun Mr.  Duncan had given him in readiness for use, got up several times,  thinking he heard suspicious noises.  After an early breakfast, and  having once more cautioned the engineer and housekeeper to be on their  guard, Tom started back in the ARROW.    As it would not be much out of his way, the young inventor decided to  cut across the lake and stop at the sanitarium, that he might inquire  about Mr. Duncan.  He thought he could speed the ARROW up sufficiently  to make up for any time he might lose, and, with this in mind, he  headed out toward the middle of Lake Carlopa.  The engine was working  splendidly with the new spark plugs, and Tom was wondering if there was  any possible method of getting more revolutions out of the motor.  He  had about come to the conclusion that a new propeller might answer his  purpose when he heard the noise of an approaching boat.  He looked up  quickly and exclaimed:    \"Andy Foger again, and Pete and Sam are with him.  It's a wonder he  wouldn't go off on a trip instead of cruising around so near home.  Guess he's afraid he'll get stuck.\"    Idly Tom watched the RED STREAK.  It was cutting through the water at a  fast rate, throwing up curling foam on either side of the sharp bow.  \"He seems to be heading this way,\" mused Tom.  \"Well, I'm not going to  race with him to-day.\"    Nearer and nearer came the speedy craft, straight for the ARROW.  The  young inventor shifted his helm in order to get out of Andy's course,  but to his surprise he saw that the red haired lad changed the  direction of his own boat.    \"Guess he wants to see how close he can come to me,\" thought our hero.  \"Maybe he wants to show how fast he's going.\"    The RED STREAK was now so close that the features of the occupants  could easily be distinguished.  There were grins on the faces of Andy  and his cronies.    \"Get out of the way or we'll run you down!\" cried the bully.  \"We've  got the right of way.\"    \"Don't you try anything like that!\" shouted Tom in some alarm, not that  he was afraid of Andy, but the RED STREAK was getting dangerously near,  and he knew Andy was not a skillful helmsman.  The auto-boat was now  headed directly at the ARROW and coming on speedily.  Andy was bending  over the wheel and Tom had begun to turn his, in order to get well out  of the way of the insolent, squint-eyed lad and his friends.    Suddenly Andy uttered a cry and leaped up.    \"Look out!  Look out!\" he yelled.  \"My steering gear has broken!  I  can't change my course.  Look out!\"    The RED STREAK was bearing right down on Tom's boat.    \"Shut off your power!  Reverse!\" shouted Tom.    Andy seemed confused and did not know what to do.  Sam Snedecker sprang  to the side of his crony, but he knew even less about a motor-boat.  It  looked as if Tom would be run down, and he was in great danger.    But the young inventor did not lose his head.  He put his wheel hard  over and then, leaping to his motor, sent it full speed forward.  Not a  moment too soon had he acted, for an instant later the other boat shot  past the stern of the ARROW, hitting it a severe but glancing blow.  Tom's boat quivered from end to end and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22748"],[0,"Explanation of Terms Used in Entomology (#13)"],[1," anterior margin of the hemelytra, from base to cuneus or membrane:  the lobes on each side of the prothorax: the special enlargement at the  base of the primaries which fits into a cavity in which the wing is  moved.
