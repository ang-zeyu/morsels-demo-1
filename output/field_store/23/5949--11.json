[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#13)"],[1," away in our house,          Hid his brother in the cellar,          Wasn't he a silly feller?    But their cousins were quite serious. They picked out wise leaders and  formed themselves into bands. They learned that they must follow their  leader, they must twitter as they flew in the darkness, so as to let  those behind know where\\he leaders were; they must follow the great  rivers southward; they must wait for a full moon before starting, and  never travel by day.    The noisy, rollicking Chicadees continued to make fun of their cousins  as they saw them now gathering in the woods along the river; and at  length, when the moon was big, bright, and full, the cousins arose to  the call of the leaders and all flew away in the gloom. The Chicadees  said that all the cousins were crazy, made some good jokes about the  Gulf of Mexico, and then dashed away on their favourite game of tag and  tumble through the woods, which, however, did seem rather quiet now, and  bare of leaves; while the weather, too, was certainly turning  uncomfortably cool.    At length the frost and snow really did come, and the Chicadees were in  a bad way. Indeed, they were frightened out of their wits, and dashed  hither and thither, seeking in vain for some one to set them aright on  the way to the warm land. They flew wildly about the woods, till they  were truly crazy. I suppose there was not a squirrel-hole or a hollow  log in the neighbourhood that some Chicadee did not enter to inquire if  this was the Gulf of Mexico. But no one could tell anything about it, no  one was going that way, and the great river was hidden under ice and  snow.    About this time a messenger from Mother Carey was passing with a message  to the Caribou in the Far North; but all he could tell the Chicadees was  that he could not be their guide, as he had other business. \"Besides,\"  he said, \"you had the same notice as your cousins whom you called  'crazy.' And from what I know of Mother Carey, you will probably have to  stick it out here all through the snow, not only now, but in every  winter after this; so you may as well make the best of it.\"    This was sad news for the Chicadee Tomtits; but they were brave little  fellows, and seeing they could not help themselves, they went about  making the best of it. Before a week had gone by they were in their  usual good spirits again, scrambling about the snowy twigs, or chasing  one another as before.    They were glad to remember now that Mother Carey said that winter would  end. They told each other about it so much that even at its beginning,  when a fresh blizzard came on, they would gleefully remark to one  another that it was a \"sign of spring,\" and one or another of the flock  would lift his voice in the sweet little chant that we all know so well:    [Illustration: Spring soon]    Another would take it up and answer back:    [Illustration: Spring com-ing]    and they would keep on repeating the song until the dreary woods rang  again with the good news, and the wood-people learned to love the brave  little bird that sets his face so cheerfully, to meet so hard a case.    And winter did end. Spring did come at last. And the sign of its coming  was when the ice broke on the stream and the pussy willow came purring  out above it. The air was full of the good news. The Chicadees felt it,  and knew it through and through. They went mad with joy, chasing each  other round and round the trees and through the hollow logs, shouting  \"The spring is here, the spring is here, Hurree, Hurree, Hurree,\" and in  another week their joyous lives were going on as before the trouble  came.    But to this day, when the chill wind blows through the deserted woods,  the Chicadees seem to lose their wits for a few days, and dart into all  sorts of queer places. They may then be found in great cities, or open  prairies, cellars, chimneys, and hollow logs; and the next time you find  one of the wanderers in any out-of-the-way corner, be sure to remember  that the Chicadee goes crazy twice a year, in the fall and in the  spring, and probably went into his strange hole or town in search of the  Gulf of Mexico.      TALE 40    The Story of the Quaking Aspen or Poplar    The leaf of the Quaking Asp is like the one marked \"a\" in the drawing.  Its trunk is smooth, greenish, or whitish, with black knots of bark like  \"c\". All the farmers know it as Popple, or White Poplar; but the hunters  call it Quaking Asp or Aspen.    [Illustration: The Story of the Quaking Aspen]    The name \"quaking\" was given because it is for ever shaking its leaves;  the slightest wind sets them all rustling. They move so easily because  each leaf-stem is like a thin, flat strap set on edge; while the  leaf-stem of such as the oak is nearly round and scarcely rustles at  all. Why does the Quaking Asp do this? No doubt, because it lives in  places where the hot dust falls thick on the leaves at times, and if it  did not have some trick of shaking it off, the leaf would be choked and  bent so that the tree could scarcely breathe; for the leaves are the  lungs of the trees. So remember, when the Poplar rustles loudly, it is  coughing to clear its lungs of the dust.    Some trees try to hide their troubles, and quickly cover up their  wounds; but the Aspen has a very touchy skin and, once it is wounded, it  shows the scar as long as it lives. We can, therefore, go to any Aspen  tree, and have it tell us the story of its life. Here is the picture of  one. The black marks at the forks (c) are scars of growth; the belts of  dots (d) were wounds given by a sapsucker to rob it of its sap; the flat  places (e) show where a Red Squirrel gnawed off the outer bark.    If a Raccoon climbed the tree (f), or an insect bored into the trunk, we  are sure to see a record of it in this sensitive bark.    Now, last of all, the paper on which this story is printed was likely  made out of Aspen wood.      TALE 41    The Witch-hazel    [Illustration: Witch-hazel]    These are the things to make you remember the Witch-hazel; its forked  twig was used--nay, still is used--as a magic rod to show where there is  running water underground; that is, where it is possible to find water  by sinking a well. Its nuts are explosive, and go off with a _snap_,  shooting the seeds that are inside, ten or twenty feet away, when the  cold dry days of autumn come. Third, its curious golden-thread flowers  appear in the fall.    As Cracked Jimmy used to sing:-            Witch-hazel blossoms in the fall,          To cure the chills and fevers all.                        --_Two Little Savages._    On November 16, 1919, after a sharp frost, I went out in the morning to  get some Witch-hazel flowers for this drawing, and found them blooming  away in the cold air, vigorously as ever. Imagine a flower that can  bloom while it is freezing. In the drawing I have shown the flower, like  a 4-lipped cup with four yellow snakes coiling out of it.    But these are not the deadly snakes one hears about. They are rather  symbols of old AEsculapius, the famous healer of the long ago, whose  emblem was the cup of life with curling snakes of wisdom about it. In  the Witch-hazel has been found a soothing balm for many an ache and  pain. The Witch-hazel you buy in the drugstores, is made out of the bark  of this tree. If you chew one of the little branches you will know it by  the taste.    Near the top is a flower that is finished, its snakes have fled; and at  the top of all is a bud for next year. That is, they are--_is_,  _has-been_ and _going-to-be_. The nuts are shown in the corner.    Note, last of all, that it is a sociable little tree; it always goes  with a crowd. There are generally three or four Witch-hazels from one  root, and there is always a family of cousins not far away.      TALE 42    How the Shad Came and How the Chestnut Got Its Burrs    In the woods of Poconic there once roamed a very discontented Porcupine.  She was forever fretting. She complained that everything was wrong, till  it was perfectly scandalous, and Wahkonda, the Great Spirit, getting  tired of her grumbling, said:    \"You and the world I have made don't seem to fit; one or the other must  be wrong. It is easier to change you. You don't like the trees, you are  unhappy on the ground, and think everything is upside down, therefore  I'll turn you inside out, and put you in the water.\" And so the  Porcupine was turned into a new creature, a fish, called the Shad. That  is why he is so full of little sharp bones.    Then after the old Porcupine had been turned into a Shad, the young ones  missed their mother, and crawled up into a high Chestnut tree to look  for her coming. Wahkonda happened to pass that way, and they all  chattered their teeth at him, thinking themselves safe. They were not  wicked, but at heart quite good, only badly brought up; oh, so  ill-trained, and some of them chattered and groaned as Wahkonda came  nearer. Then Wahkonda was sorry for them, remembering that he had taken  their mother from them, and said: \"You look very well up there, you  little Porkys, so you had better stay there for always, and be part of  the Chestnut tree.\" And he touched each one with his magic wand and  turned it into a burr that grew tight to the tree. That is how it came  about. There they hang like a lot of little Porcupines on the twigs of  the tree. They are spiney and dangerous, utterly without manners, and  yet most of them have a good little heart inside.      TALE 43    How the Littlest Owl Came    After the Great Spirit had made the world and the creatures in it, he  made the Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo. This was like an Owl, but bigger than  anything else alive, and his voice was like a river plunging over a  rocky ledge. He was so big that he thought he had done it all himself,  and he became puffed up. He forgot the Great Spirit, who decided to  teach him a lesson in this wise:    He called the Blue-jay, the mischief-maker of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23668"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Salisbury (#13)"],[1," was possibly intended to raise and lower a  baldichino, or ciborium that hung originally over the altar, or still  more probably the pyx, which as many instances show was usually  suspended above it.    Possibly the altar was moved when, owing to the early settlement of  some of the piers, it was found necessary to wall up the space between  the arches opening into the choir transepts, and insert the  perpendicular arches as a counter thrust to the strain of the central  tower. It is hardly conceivable that the evidence offered by the roof  paintings, and the solitary instance of carved capitals, can be  misleading on this point.    =The East= (or =Choir=) =Transept=, which on the north side, screened  as it is from the aisle, is used and known also as the Morning Chapel,  has on its west wall a portion of a very beautiful screen of Early  English work. Of this John Carter, from whose pages the accompanying  sketch of a portion is reproduced, says that it was moved during  Wyatt's restoration, as he naively puts it, \"during the late  dilapidatious innovations, and modern fanciful introductions so fatal  to our study of antiquities.\" Other authorities consider its original  position uncertain. Yet since its architecture is obviously coeval  with that of the building, and the arches inserted by Bishop  Beauchamp show proof of having been planned to rest on something at  the base of the tower piers, there can be little doubt that when Wyatt  removed the screen to re-erect a medley of his own composing made of  fragments of the demolished chantries, he disturbed one more of the  original features of the cathedral.       [Illustration: PORTION OF THE OLD ORGAN SCREEN.     _From a Drawing by H.P. Clifford._]    A curious double aumbry in the north wall of this chapel is unusual,  not merely in the pitch of its arches, which are triangular gables,  but also in the solid stone shelves dividing its space into six  compartments; other aumbries in this church show similar features, but  this alone retains its original wooden doors. The superb brass of  Bishop Wyville (illustrated on p. 114) is in the pavement of this  transept. It is illustrated in almost every work on monumental brasses  as a notable example. A canopied lavatory of beautiful design is upon  the east wall to the right, the altar being not in the centre, but  almost in the corner on the left-hand side.    =The Eastern Aisle= is not so important as similar \"processionals\" at  Exeter, Winchester, and some other English churches; still, the grace  of its clustered columns, like those of the Lady Chapel, give it a  character of its own.       [Illustration: PISCINA IN THE SOUTH CHOIR AISLE.]    =The Lady Chapel=, originally separated from the choir, thrown into  the presbytery by Wyatt for the sake of his much overrated vista, is  once again partially hidden by the reredos and the grille work of the  screen on either side. As the earliest portion of the building, and  the only part Bishop Poore lived to see completed, it would not lack  interest, were it commonplace in character; but it is on the contrary  a particularly graceful example of its time. The whole chapel is  divided into a nave and side aisles by single and clustered shafts of  Purbeck marble. These extremely slender shafts look unequal to the  heavy groined roof they support; for although nearly thirty feet high,  the four largest are not quite ten inches in diameter, while the  clustered ones are mere rods. Francis Price, whose interest in the  building, as he showed throughout his monograph, was that of a  practical builder, was \"amazed at the vast boldness of the architect,  who certainly piqued himself on leaving to posterity an instance of  such small pillars bearing so great a load. One would not suppose  them,\" he says, \"to stand so firm of themselves as even to resist the  force of an ordinary wind.\" The modern colouring of this part of the  building, including the low eastern aisle immediately behind the  reredos, is claimed to be an exact restoration of the original, but it  is hardly agreeable. The black of the newly polished marble shafts,  the dull green of other parts, with the red, green, and white of the  vaulting ribs, is more bizarre than beautiful. In regarding traces of  mediaeval colouring one often forgets that time has blended  harmoniously a scheme otherwise entirely crude, and to modern taste  unpleasing. How far in English instances this is emphasized by the  absence of rich hangings, carpets, vestments, and pictures, it is not  within our subject to inquire; but since such restoration of the  primitive colouring offends one less in churches that still preserve  the more ornate furniture of the Roman Ritual, it is at least a moot  point.    The triple lancet east window at the end of the Lady Chapel was filled  formerly with stained glass, representing \"The Resurrection,\" after a  design by Sir Joshua Reynolds; it is now replaced by modern glass in  memory of the late Dean Lear. An altarpiece, composed of fragments of  the destroyed Hungerford and Beauchamp Chapels, was set up here by  Wyatt. It has lately been replaced by a triptych designed by Sir  Arthur Blomfield, with very beautiful panels painted by Mr.  Buckeridge. The seven-branched candlesticks in black-wood, silver  mounted, are by the same architect. The altar frontal, designed by Mr.  Sidney Gambier Parry, and worked by Mrs. Weigall, is so good that it  must not be overlooked. The altar itself is of stone from an old  altarpiece. Under the windows runs a series of niches, once in the  Beauchamp Chapel. Above these rich and delicate canopies, with foliage  and fan-tracery springing from corbelled heads, runs an exquisitely  sculptured frieze.    In this place, after he was canonized in 1456, the shrine of St.  Osmund was erected. His supposed tomb, moved by Wyatt to the nave, is  now replaced between the Lady Chapel and the southern aisle. Of the  shrine no trace remains; but legends of the miracles worked at it, and  the special indulgences granted to the pilgrims who visited it, prove  that it existed on this spot. The date MXCIX. inscribed upon this slab  has been questioned, on the authority of a diary made by Captain  Symons (in 1644), now in the British Museum, in which an entry occurs  with reference to this inscription, \"a blew stone rising four ynches  from the ground, the east end narrower than the west, this lately  written Anno MXCIX.,\" but whether he means to infer that it was lately  restored, or that the date itself was a later addition, is not quite  clear. The characters of the inscription Planche pointed out  correspond in form with those at the time of William the Conqueror,  and as sepulchral effigies are uncommon until the middle of the  twelfth century, the presumption is in its favour; still it is  somewhat pathetic to find that the evidence which serves to connect  this otherwise unknown monument with the famous St. Osmund, the  greatest figure, not merely of the cathedral, but of the English  Church of his time, is not absolutely beyond suspicion. Yet even if  the Roman numerals were a later addition, it is hardly credible that  the shrine of so popular a saint could have been wrongly identified.  When Wyatt, according to his usual habit, explored the interior of the  tomb, nothing was found within it.       [Illustration: ALTAR AND TRIPTYCH REREDOS IN THE LADY CHAPEL.     _From a Photograph by Witcomb and Son, Salisbury._]    In 1540 Leland saw here a \"ballet,\" which he transcribes for his  Itinerary, with an inscription commanding the faithful to pray for the  repose of the soul of Richard Poore.    =Monuments in the Transept, Choir and Lady Chapel.=--The most  important on the west wall of the north great transept is a brass (21)  in memory of John Britton, who did so much to revive a taste for  archaeology and ecclesiastical art by his splendid series of monographs  on the cathedrals, and his topographical works. A fine monument of its  class is one by Bacon (22), which represents Moral Philosophy mourning  over a medallion of James Harris, author of \"Hermes\" and father of the  first Earl of Malmesbury; to whose memory close by is a full-length  portrait figure by Chantrey. A figure (23) of Benevolence lifting the  veil from a bas-relief of the good Samaritan, by Flaxman, commemorates  William Benson Earle, Esq., of the Close, Salisbury. On the north wall  of this transept is a canopied effigy (24) of a bishop said to  represent John Blythe, who died in 1499. It was originally in the  ambulatory of the Lady Chapel, behind the high altar, until Wyatt  removed it to its present site. In this transept is the statue (25) to  Sir Richard Colt Hoare, author of the \"Histories of Modern and Ancient  Wiltshire,\" and other works. It is a seated figure not without  dignity, by R.C. Lucas, a native of Salisbury. A portrait bust to  Richard Jefferies, with a long and eulogistic inscription, is upon a  bracket on the west wall.    Two other monuments by Flaxman deserve notice. That to Walter Long,  Esq. (26), a medallion supported by two figures representing Justice  and Literature, and one (27) to his brother, William Long, in florid  Gothic style, with figures of Science and Benevolence. Dr. Waaegen, in  his \"Art Treasures of Great Britain,\" says: \"The three monuments by  Flaxman (in Salisbury) two of which are in Gothic taste, prove that he  was superior to most English sculptors in knowledge of the  architectonic style. There is nothing extraordinary in the design, but  the workmanship is good, and there is real feeling in the heads.\"    In the north choir aisle, at its junction with the great transept, is  a large Purbeck marble altar tomb (28), with panels and tracery,  despoiled of the brass legend and armorial bearings it formerly  exhibited. This is supposed to have commemorated Bishop Woodville, who  died 1484. Two marble slabs that until 1778 were in the floor of this  side"]]]
