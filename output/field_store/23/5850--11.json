The two shoulder blades are always saved and are  considered a valuable trophy. They are little bones three inches long,  unattached and floating, and have long since ceased to perform any  function in the working of the body. The broken tooth was found and  saved, and, of course, a photograph was taken. My gunbearer took the  picture, and when it was developed there was only a part of the lion and  part of the lion slayer visible. It was a good picture of the tree,  however.    [Drawing: _As I Looked--From Photograph by Gunbearer_]    At four-thirty the homeward march was begun. At five-thirty two rhinos  blocked the path and one of them had to be shot. At six we were still  several miles from camp, with the country wrapped in darkness. The water  was gone and only one shell remained for the big gun. Somewhere ahead  were miles of thorn scrub in which there might be rhinos or buffaloes.  Two days before I had killed two large buffaloes in the district through  which we must pass, and there was every likelihood of others still being  there. At seven we were hopelessly lost in a wide stretch of hippo  grass, and I had to fire a shot in the hope of getting an answering shot  from camp. In a couple of moments we heard the distant shot, and then  pressed on toward camp. The lion had been carried on ahead while we  stopped with the rhino, and so the news reached the camp before us. A  long line of porters came out to greet us and a great reception  committee was waiting at the camp. It was the first lion of the  expedition, and as such was the signal for great celebration. That night  there were native dances and songs around the big central camp-fire and  a wonderful display of pagan hilarity.    It had been a hard day. Fourteen hours without food, several hours  without water, and miles of hard tramping through thorn scrub in the  darkness and of long, broiling stretches in the blazing sunlight. It  seemed a good price to pay even for a lion, but that night, as I finally  stretched out on my cot, I was conscious from time to time of a glow of  pleasure that swept over me. It seemed that of all human gratifications  there was none equal to that experienced by the man who has killed his  first lion.    My second lion experience came three days later. With a couple of tents  and about forty porters our party of four had marched across to a point  a couple of miles from where I had killed the lion. We hoped to put in a  day or two looking for lions, some of which had been reported in that  district. The porters went on ahead with the camp equipment, while we  came along more slowly. Mr. Akeley had taken some close-range  photographs of rhinos, and we were just on the point of starting direct  for the new camp when we ran across two enormous rhinos standing in the  open plain. One was extremely large, with an excellent pair of horns,  and it was arranged that I should try to secure this one as a trophy,  while Mr. Akeley secured a photograph of the event. At thirty-five yards  I shot the larger one of the two, and it dropped in its tracks. The  other started to charge, but was finally driven away by shouting and by  shots fired in the air. The photograph was excellent and quite dramatic.    For an hour the gunbearers worked on the dead rhino and finally secured  the head and feet and certain desirable parts of the skin. At noon we  resumed our march for camp, two or three miles away. We had hardly gone  half the distance when one of the tent boys was seen far ahead, riding  the one mule that we had dared to bring down the Tana River. It was  evident that something important had occurred and we hurried on to meet  him.    \"_Simba!_\" he shouted, as soon as he could be heard. In a moment we had  the details. One of the saises had seen two lions, a large male and  female, quite near the camp. Porters were instructed to watch the beasts  until we should arrive, and now were supposed to be in touch with them.  We omitted luncheon and struck off at once in the direction indicated by  the tent boy. We soon came up to the porters and an instant later saw  the lions. It was a beautiful sight. The two animals were majestically  walking up the rocky slope of a low, fire-scorched hill a few hundred  yards away. The male was a splendid beast, with all the splendid dignity  of one who fears nothing in the whole wide world. From time to time the  two lions stopped and looked back at us, but with no sign of fear.  Several times they lay down, but soon would resume their stately course  up among the rocks.    I shall never forget the picture that lay before me. It was as though  some famous lion painting of Gerome or Landseer had come to life,  sometimes the animals being outlined clearly against the blue sky and at  other times standing, with splendid heads erect, upon the rocks of the  low ridge that rose ahead of us.    We stalked them easily. Several porters were left where the lions could  constantly see them, while we three, Akeley, Stephenson and I, with our  six gunbearers, worked around the base of the hill until we were able to  climb up on the crest of it, being thus constantly screened from view of  the lions. At the crest was an abrupt outcropping of blackened rocks,  where we stopped to locate the two animals. They were nowhere to be  seen. Twenty-five yards farther along on the crest was another little  ledge of rocks, and we worked our way silently along to it in the  expectation that the lions might have advanced that far. But even then  our search disclosed nothing. For some time we waited, scouring the  neighborhood with our glasses, and had almost reached the conclusion  that the lions had made off down the other side of the hill and had  reached the cover of a shallow ravine some distance away. Then we saw  them--exactly where we had last seen them before we had started our  stalk. They were still together and showed no sign of alarm nor  knowledge of our presence so near them. At this time they were one  hundred and ten yards away. They lay down again behind the rocks and we  waited twenty minutes for them to show themselves. Off to our right and  in the valley another large male lion appeared and moved slowly away  among the low scrub trees.    Finally we decided to rouse the two lions by shouting, but before this  decision could be carried out the male rose above the rocks and stood  plainly in view. It had previously been arranged that Mr. Stephenson  should try for the male, while I should try for the female. In an  instant he fired with his big rifle, the lion whirled around and then  started running down the hill to the right.    Then the lioness appeared and I wounded her with my first shot. She ran  out in the open toward us, but evidently without knowing from where the  firing came. A second shot was better placed and I saw her collapse in  her tracks. Leaving the lioness, I went down to where Stephenson had  followed the lion. Several shots had been fired, but the lion was still  running, although badly wounded. Just as it reached a small tree down on  the slope a shot was put into a vital spot, and the lion went wildly  over on his side. Even then he managed to drag himself under the small  bushes surrounding the tree, where a moment later Mr. Stephenson killed  him with a shot from his .318 Mauser.    [Drawing: _\"A Very Interesting Experience,\" Said I Coolly, a Couple  of Days Later_]    We measured and photographed the lion, and then I took my camera to get  a picture of the dead lioness up on the ridge. She was sitting up  snarling, and I was the most surprised person in the world. I shot at  her and she ran fifty yards to a small tree, where she came to a stop.  Two more shots from my big gun finished her, and the photograph was  finally secured.    Leaving the porters to watch the two lions, we followed the third lion  that had been seen in the valley. He had not gone far and we soon found  him, but too far away to get a shot. For an hour we followed him, but he  finally disappeared and could not be located again.    It was sundown when our porters reached camp with the two lions, and it  was then that we ate our long-deferred luncheon.    A week later, while marching from the Tana River to the Zeka River, Mr.  and Mrs. Akeley and I came across a large lion, accompanied by a  lioness. They were first seen moving away across a low sloping ridge of  the plains within a couple of miles of where we had killed the lion and  lioness a week before. We followed them and came up with them after a  brisk walk of ten minutes. Both were hiding in the grass near the crest  of the slope, and we could see their ears and eyes above the long grass.  We crouched down a hundred yards away and the lion rose to see where we  had gone. Mrs. Akeley fired and missed, but her second shot pierced his  brain and he fell like a log. We expected a charge from the lioness and  waited until she should declare herself. But she did not appear and her  whereabouts remained an anxious mystery until she was finally seen  several hundred yards away making her way slowly up a distant hill.  Half-way up she sat down and watched us as we made our way cautiously in  the grass to where her mate lay as he fell, stone dead. We afterward  followed her, but she escaped from view and could not be located. This  lion was the largest we had seen and measured nine feet from tip to tip.    This was our last experience with lions in the Trans-Tana country. After  that we went up in the elephant country on Mount Kenia, but that is a  story all in itself.    Lion hunting is the best kind of African hunting in one respect. One  feels no self-reproach in having killed a lion, for there is always the  comforting thought that by killing one lion you have saved the lives of  three hundred other animals.

I think Dexter is dead, and it is very probable that Hassan and  Company are already homeward bound with the slipper of the Prophet.\"    With all my heart I hoped that he might be right, but an intuition  was with me crying that he was wrong, that many bloody deeds would  be, ere the sacred slipper should return to the East.          CHAPTER XVI    THE DWARF      The manner in which we next heard of the whereabouts of the Prophet's  slipper was utterly unforeseen, wildly dramatic.  That the Hashishin  were aware that I, though its legal trustee, no longer had charge  of the relic nor knowledge of its resting-place, was sufficiently  evident from the immunity which I enjoyed at this time from that  ceaseless haunting by members of the uncanny organization ruled by  Hassan.  I had begun to feel more secure in my chambers, and no  longer worked with a loaded revolver upon the table beside me.  But  the slightest unusual noise in the night still sufficed to arouse  me and set me listening intently, to chill me with dread of what  it might portend.  In short, my nerves were by no means recovered  from the ceaseless strain of the events connected with and arising  out of the death of my poor friend, Professor Deeping.    One evening as I sat at work in my chambers, with the throb of busy  Fleet Street and its thousand familiar sounds floating in to me  through the open windows, my phone bell rang.    Even as I turned to take up the receiver a foreboding possessed me  that my trusteeship was no longer to be a sinecure.  It was  Bristol who had rung me up, and upon very strange business.    \"A development at last!\" he said; \"but at present I don't know what  to make of it.  Can you come down now?\"    \"Where are you speaking from?\"    \"From the Waterloo Road--a delightful neighbourhood.  I shall be  glad if you can meet me at the entrance to Wyatt's Buildings in  half an hour.\"    \"What is it?  Have you found Dexter?\"    \"No, unfortunately.  But it's murder!\"    I knew as I hung up the receiver that my brief period of peace was  ended; that the lists of assassination were reopened.  I hurried  out through the court into Fleet Street, thinking of the key of the  now empty case at the Museum which reposed at my bankers, thinking  of the devils who pursued the slipper, thinking of the hundred and  one things, strange and terrible, which went to make up the history  of that gruesome relic.    Wyatt's Buildings, Waterloo Road, are a gloomy and forbidding block  of dwellings which seem to frown sullenly upon the high road, from  which they are divided by a dark and dirty courtyard.  Passing an  iron gateway, you enter, by way of an arch, into this sinister place  of uncleanness.  Male residents in their shirt sleeves lounge  against the several entrances.  Bedraggled women nurse dirty infants  and sit in groups upon the stone steps, rendering them almost  impassable.  But to-night a thing had happened in Wyatt's Buildings  which had awakened in the inhabitants, hardened to sordid crime, a  sort of torpid interest.    Faces peered from most of the windows which commanded a view of the  courtyard, looking like pallid blotches against the darkness; but  a number of police confined the loungers within their several  doorways, so that the yard itself was comparatively clear.    I had had some difficulty in forcing a way through the crowd which  thronged the entrance, but finally I found myself standing beside  Inspector Bristol and looking down upon that which had brought us  both to Wyatt's Buildings.    There was no moon that night, and only the light of the lamp in the  archway, with some faint glimmers from the stairways surrounding the  court, reached the dirty paving.  Bristol directed the light of a  pocket-lamp upon the hunched-up figure which lay in the dust, and I  saw it to be that of a dwarfish creature, yellow skinned and wearing  only a dark loin cloth.  He had a malformed and disproportionate  head, a head that had been too large even for a big man.  I knew  after first glance that this was one of the horrible dwarfs employed  by the Hashishin in their murderous business.  It might even be the  one who had killed Deeping; but this was impossible to determine  by reason of the fact that the hideous, swollen head, together with  the features, was completely crushed.  I shall not describe the  creature's appearance in further detail.    Having given me an opportunity to examine the dead dwarf, Bristol  returned the electric lamp to his pocket and stood looking at me in  the semi-gloom.  A constable stood on duty quite near to us, and  others guarded the archway and the doors to the dwellings.  The  murmur of subdued voices echoed hollowly in the wells of the  staircases, and a constant excited murmur proceeded from the crowd  at the entrance.  No pressmen had yet been admitted, though numbers  of them were at the gates.    \"It happened less than an hour ago,\" said Bristol.  \"The place was  much as you see it now, and from what I can gather there came the  sound of a shot and several people saw the dwarf fall through the  air and drop where he lies!\"    The light was insufficient to show the expression upon the speaker's  face, but his voice told of a great wonder.    \"It is a bit like an Indian conjuring trick,\" I said, looking up to  the sky above us; \"who fired the shot?\"    \"So far,\" replied Bristol, \"I have failed to find out; but there's  a bullet in the thing's head.  He was dead before he reached the  pavement.\"    \"Did no one see the flash of the pistol?\"    \"No one that I have got hold of yet.  Of course this kind of  evidence is very unreliable; these people regularly go out of their  way to mislead the police.\"    \"You think the body may have been carried here from somewhere else?\"    \"Oh, no; this is where it fell, right enough.  You can see where  his head struck the stones.\"    \"He has not been moved at all?\"    \"No; I shall not move him until I've worked out where in heaven's  name he can have fallen from!  You and I have seen some mysterious  things happen, Mr. Cavanagh, since the slipper of the Prophet came  to England and brought these people\"--he nodded toward the thing  at our feet--\"in its train; but this is the most inexplicable  incident to date.  I don't know what to make of it at all.  Quite  apart from the question of where the dwarf fell from, who shot at  him and why?\"    \"Have you no theory?\" I asked.  \"The incident to my mind points  directly to one thing.  We know that this uncanny creature belonged  to the organization of Hassan of Aleppo.  We know that Hassan  implacably pursues one object--the slipper.  In pursuit of the  slipper, then, the dwarf came here.  Bristol!\"--I laid my hand upon  his arm, glancing about me with a very real apprehension--\"the  slipper must be somewhere near!\"    Bristol turned to the constable standing hard by.    \"Remain here,\" he ordered.  Then to me: \"I should like you to come  up on to the roof.  From there we can survey the ground and perhaps  arrive at some explanation of how the dwarf came to fall upon that  spot.\"    Passing the constable on duty at one of the doorways and making our  way through the group of loiterers there, we ascended amid  conflicting odours to the topmost floor.  A ladder was fixed against  the wall communicating with a trap in the ceiling.  Several  individuals in their shirt sleeves and all smoking clay pipes had  followed us up.  Bristol turned upon them.    \"Get downstairs,\" he said--\"all the lot of you, and stop there!\"    With muttered imprecations our audience dispersed, slowly returning  by the way they had come.  Bristol mounted the ladder and opened the  trap.  Through the square opening showed a velvet patch spangled  with starry points.  As he passed up on to the roof and I followed  him, the comparative cleanness of the air was most refreshing after  the varied fumes of the staircase.    Side by side we leaned upon the parapet looking down into the dirty  courtyard which was the theatre of this weird mystery; looking down  upon the stage, sordidly Western, where a mystic Eastern tragedy  had been enacted.    I could see the constable standing beside the crushed thing upon  the stones.    \"Now,\" said Bristol, with a sort of awe in his voice, \"where did he  fall from?\"    And at his words, looking down at the spot where the dwarf lay, and  noting that he could not possibly have fallen there from any of the  buildings surrounding the courtyard, an eerie sensation crept over  me; for I was convinced that the happening was susceptible of no  natural explanation.    I had heard--who has not heard?--of the Indian rope trick, where  a fakir throws a rope into the air which remains magically suspended  whilst a boy climbs upward and upward until he disappears into space.  I had never credited accounts of the performance; but now I began  seriously to wonder if the arts of Hassan of Aleppo were not as  great or greater than the arts of fakir.  But the crowning mystery  to my mind was that of the Hashishin's death.  It would seem that  as he had hung suspended in space he had been shot!    \"You say that someone heard the sound of the shot?\" I asked suddenly.    \"Several people,\" replied Bristol; \"but no one knows, or no one  will say, from what direction it came.  I shall go on with the  inquiry, of course, and cross-examine every soul in Wyatt's  Buildings.  Meanwhile, I'm open to confess that I am beaten.\"    In the velvet sky countless points blazed tropically.  The hum of  the traffic in Waterloo Road reached us only in a muffled way.  Sordidness lay beneath us, but up there under the heavens we seemed  removed from it as any Babylonian astronomer communing with the  stars.    When, some ten minutes"]]]
