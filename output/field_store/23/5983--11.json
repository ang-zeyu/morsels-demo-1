This famous sword was won by Carlo Magno in his youth when  he overcame Polinoro, the captain-general of Bramante, King of Africa.  Carlo Magno, having another sword of his own and wishing to keep la  Durlindana in the family, passed it on to his nephew Orlando.  That is  Pasquale's version.  Others say that it was given to Orlando by Malagigi  the magician.  The most usual account is that la Durlindana belonged to  Hector.  After the fall of Troy it came to AEneas; and from him, through  various owners, to Almonte, a giant of a dreadful stature, who slew  Orlando's father.  An angel in a dream directed Orlando, when he was  about eighteen, to proceed to a river on the bank of which he found Carlo  Magno and Almonte fighting.  He took his uncle's part, avenged his  father's death by killing Almonte, threw his gigantic body into the  stream and appropriated his enchanted possessions, namely, his horse,  Brigliadoro, his horn, his sword and his armour.  He had the sword with  him when he was defeated at Roncisvalle and threw it from him, about two  hundred miles, to Rocamadour in France where it stuck in a rock and any  one can see it to this day.    I do not remember that Homer speaks of Hector's sword as la Durlindana;  perhaps he did not know.  But every one knows that horses have had names,  both in romance and real life, from the days of Pegasus to our own.  Mario calls his horses Gaspare, after one of the Three Kings, and Toto,  which is a form of Salvatore.  They were so called before he bought them,  or he would have named them Baiardo and Brigliadoro.  Having no sword, he  calls his whip la Durlindana.  He assured me that the barber whom he  employs calls all his razors by the names of the swords of the paladins,  and that the shoe-blacks give similar names to their brushes.    If Pasquale's statements were at variance with other poetical versions of  the story, they were, as might be expected, still more so with the prose  authorities.  In the books, Carlo Magno was born sometimes in the castle  of Saltzburg, in Bavaria, and sometimes at Aix-la-Chapelle; which may be  good history, but could not well be represented by the marionettes  without a double stage, and even then might fail to convince.  The Carlo  Magno of romance, son of Pipino, King of France, and Berta, his wife, was  not born until many years after the wedding; for Berta had enemies at the  French Court who spirited her away immediately after the ceremony,  substituting her waiting-maid, Elisetta, who was so like her that Pipino  did not notice the difference.  Elisetta became the mother of the wicked  bastards Lanfroi and Olderigi, while Berta lived in retirement in the  cottage of a hunter on the banks of the Magno, a river about five leagues  from Paris.  Pipino lost himself while out hunting one day, took refuge  in the cottage, saw Berta, did not recognize his lawful, wedded wife and  fell in love with her over again.  Carlo Magno was born in due course in  the cottage, and his second name was given to him, not for the prosaic  reason that it means the Great, but because it is the name of the river.  The bastards afterwards murder their father, which is a warning to any  bridegroom among the audience to be careful not to mistake another lady  for his bride upon the wedding night.  And thus Romance becomes the  handmaid of Morality.    Carlo Magno is now on the throne.  I was presented to him, and found him  in mourning for a nephew who had been killed a few evenings before and  whose corpse was still hanging on a neighbouring peg, waiting for the  slight alteration necessary to turn him into some one else.  All the  paladins who had recently lost relations were in mourning and wore long  pieces of crape trailing from their helmets.  Pasquale took me round,  told me who they all were and explained their genealogies.    I was in a hades peopled with the ghosts of Handel's operas.  I saw  Orlando himself and his cousins \"Les quatre fils Aymon,\" namely Rinaldo  da Montalbano, Guicciardo, Alardo, and Ricciardetto.  I saw their father,  whose name in Italian is Amone, and their sister Bradamante, the widow of  Ruggiero da Risa, and her sister-in-law, the Empress Marfisa, Ruggiero's  sister.  These two ladies were in armour, showing their legs, and in all  respects like the men warriors, except that they wore their hair long.    \"Bradamante will die this evening,\" said Pasquale.    I expressed regret, and asked for particulars.    \"She will die of grief for the loss of her husband, Ruggiero da Risa, who  has been killed by the treachery of Conte Gano.\"    Then I saw my fellow-countryman, Astolfo d'Inghilterra; he it was that  brought back from the moon the lost wits of Orlando when he became  furioso because Angelica would have nothing to say to him and married  Medoro.  And I saw Astolfo's father, Ottone d'Inghilterra, and Il Re  Desiderio and Gandellino, who seemed undersized; but when I said so,  Pasquale replied--    \"Si, e piccolo, ma e bello--stupendo,\" and so he was.    I took down one of the knights, stood him on the floor and tried to work  him.  The number of things I had to hold at once puzzled me a good deal,  especially the strings.  Pasquale took another knight and gave me a  lesson, showing me how to make him weep and meditate, how to raise and  lower his vizor, how to draw his sword and fight.  It was very difficult  to get him to put his sword back into the scabbard.  I could not do it at  all, though I managed the other things after a fashion.    Then I saw the Marchese Oliviero di Allemagna and Uggiero Danese and  Turpino, a priest, but a warrior nevertheless.    \"This,\" said Pasquale, \"is Guidon Selvaggio, and this is his sister  Carmida.  They are the children of Rinaldo.\"    \"But spurious,\" interrupted another youth.    \"Yes,\" agreed Pasquale; \"they are bastards.  Shall I tell you how?\"    But I declined to rake up the family scandal and we passed on to  Carmida's husband, Cladinoro, Re di Bizerta, a spurious son of the old  Ruggiero da Risa, and so valorous that they speak of La Forza di  Cladinoro.    All these knights and ladies were hanging on one side of the stage in two  rows, one row against the wall and the other in front.  I asked Pasquale  how he knew which was which.  He concealed his astonishment at such a  simple question and replied--    \"By the crests on their helmets.\"    I then observed that they all wore their proper crests, a lion or an  eagle, or a castle, or whatever it might be; Ferrau had no crest, but he  had a special kind of helmet, and these boys knew them all in the  legitimate way by their armorial bearings, and that was how, on the  evening of Angelica's death, the audience knew all the knights and said  their names as they entered.    On the other side of the stage were two rows of pagans who in this hades,  where the odium theologicum persists, are not admitted among Christians.  Here hung Il Re Marsilio di Spagna, who was to be defeated this evening,  and his two brothers, Bulugante and Falserone, his son the Infanta di  Spagna, his nephew Ferrau, now dead, and Grandonio.  Then I came upon a  miscellaneous collection and could look at no more knights or ladies  after I had found the devil.    He was not The Devil, he was only \"un diavolo qualunque,\" but he was  fascinating, and he had horns and a tail--Pasquale and the other youths  showed me his tail very particularly and laughed at him cruelly for  having one.  But it was not his fault, poor devil, that he had a tail:  except for the wear and tear of his tempestuous youth he was as he had  left the hands of his maker.    There was also a skeleton; they made him dance for me and said that he is  used to appear to any one about to die; but this cannot apply to the  warriors, for they fight and die freely, and put whole families into  mourning nightly, and if the skeleton appeared to them every time, a new  one would be wanted once a month.    And there was \"un gigante qualunque\"--the raw material for a giant,  something that could be faked up into this or that special giant when  wanted.  Similarly there was a lady having her dress and wig altered,  they told me she was \"una donna qualunque\"--the very words I had seen a  few weeks previously written up in Rome to advertise a performance in  Italian of _A Woman of no Importance_.  I suspect there must have been  somewhere \"un guerriero qualunque\" so constructed that his head could be  cut off, and that he had been disguised as and substituted for the Duca  d'Avilla when Ferrau appeared to kill that warrior, for, without  trickery, no sword in the teatrino, not even la Durlindana, could have  cut off a head which had an iron rod running through it.    There was a confused heap of Turks and Spanish soldiers lying in a  corner, and at the back of the stage, between the farthest scene and the  wall of the theatre, was the stable containing seven war horses and one  centaur.  Pasquale told me that the centaur was \"un animale selvaggio\"  which I knew, but he did not tell me what part he took in the play.  One  of the horses, of course, was Baiardo, the special horse of Rinaldo.  Baiardo is still living in the forest of Ardennes, he formerly belonged  to Amadis de Gaul and was found in a grotto by Malagigi when he found  Rinaldo's sword, Fusberta, which used to belong to the King of Cyprus.    It appeared to me time to go to the front, but Pasquale said that this  evening I might stay behind during the performance if I liked and I  accepted his invitation, for I had a toy theatre of my own once and used  to do _The Miller and His Men_ with an explosion at the end; it had to be  at the end, not only as a bonne-bouche, but also because my audience, not  being composed of Sicilian facchini, were driven out of the room by its  effects.

[Illustration: 30.--RAM'S HEAD IN ALABASTER. (British Museum.)]    [Illustration: 31.--EBONY COMB. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    [Illustration: 32.--BRONZE FORK AND SPOON. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    23. Perhaps the queerest coffin shape of all is that composed of two  earthen jars (_a_ and _b_), which accurately fit together, or one  slightly fits into the other, the juncture being made air-tight by a  coating of bitumen (_d_, _d_). The body can be placed in such a coffin  only with slightly bent knees. At one end (_c_) there is an air-hole,  left for the escape of the gases which form during the decomposition of  the body and which might otherwise burst the jars--a precaution probably  suggested by experience (fig. 36). Sometimes there is only one jar of  much larger size, but of the same shape, with a similar cover, also made  fast with bitumen, or else the mouth is closed with bricks. This is an  essentially national mode of burial, perhaps the most ancient of all,  yet it remained in use to a very late period. It is to be noted that  this is the exact shape of the water jars now carried about the streets  of Baghdad and familiar to every traveller.    [Illustration: 33.--ARMENIAN LOUVRE. (Botta.)]    24. Not much less original is the so-called \"dish-cover coffin,\" also  very ancient and national. The illustrations sufficiently show its shape  and arrangement.[Q] In these coffins two skeletons are sometimes found,  showing that when a widow or widower died, it was opened, to lay the  newly dead by the side of the one who had gone before. The cover is all  of one piece--a very respectable achievement of the potter's art. In  Mugheir (ancient Ur), a mound was found, entirely filled with this kind  of coffins.    [Illustration: 34.--VAULTED DRAINS. (KHORSABAD.) (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    [Illustration: 35.--VAULTED DRAIN. (KHORSABAD.) (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    25. Much more elaborate, and consequently, probably reserved for the  noble and wealthy, is the sepulchral vault in brick, of nearly a man's  height.[R] In these sepulchres, as in the preceding ones, the skeleton  is always found lying in the same position, evidently dictated by some  religious ideas. The head is pillowed on a large brick, commonly covered  with a piece of stuff or a rug. In the tattered rags which sometimes  still exist, costly embroideries and fringed golden tissue have more  than once been recognized, while some female skeletons still showed  handsome heads of hair gathered into fine nets. The body lies on a reed  mat, on its left side, the right hand stretched out so as to reach with  the tips of the fingers a bowl, generally of copper or bronze, and  sometimes of fine workmanship, usually placed on the palm of the left  hand. Around are placed various articles--dishes, in some of which  remnants of food are found, such as date stones,--jars for water, lamps,  etc. Some skeletons wear gold and silver bangles on their wrists and  ankles. These vaults were evidently family sepulchres, for several  skeletons are generally found in them; in one there were no less than  eleven. (Fig. 39, p. 89.)    [Illustration: 36.--CHALDEAN JAR-COFFIN. (Taylor.)]    26. All these modes of burial are very old and peculiarly Chaldean. But  there is still another, which belongs to more recent times, even as late  as the first centuries after Christ, and was used by a different and  foreign race, the Parthians, one of those who came in turns and  conquered the country, stayed there awhile, then disappeared. These  coffins are, from their curious form, known under the name of  \"slipper-shaped.\" They are glazed, green on the outside and blue on the  inside, but of very inferior make: poor clay, mixed with straw, and only  half baked, therefore very brittle. It is thought that they were put in  their place empty, then the body was laid in, the lid put down, and the  care of covering them with sand left to the winds. The lid is fastened  with the same mortar which is used in the brick masonry surrounding the  coffin, where such a receptacle has been made for it; but they more  usually lie pell-mell, separated only by thin layers of loose sand.  There are mounds which are, as one may say, larded with them: wherever  you begin to dig a trench, the narrow ends stick out from both sides. In  these coffins also various articles were buried with the dead, sometimes  valuable ones. The Arabs know this; they dig in the sand with their  hands, break the coffins open with their spears, and grope in them for  booty. The consequence is that it is extremely difficult to procure an  entire coffin. Loftus succeeded, however, in sending some to the British  Museum, having first pasted around them several layers of thick paper,  without which precaution they could not have borne the transport.    [Illustration: 37.--\"DISH-COVER\" TOMB AT MUGHEIR. (Taylor.)]    [Illustration: 38.--\"DISH-COVER\" TOMB. (Taylor.)]    27. On the whole, the ancient Chaldean sepulchres of the three first  kinds are distinguished by greater care and tidiness. They are not only  separated by brick partitions on the sides, and also above and below  by a thin layer of brick masonry, but the greatest care was taken to  protect them against dampness. The sepulchral mounds are pierced through  and through, from top to bottom, by drainage pipes or shafts, consisting  of a series of rings, solidly joined together with bitumen, about one  foot in diameter. These rings are made of baked clay. The top one is  shaped somewhat like a funnel, of which the end is inserted in  perforated bricks, and which is provided with small holes, to receive  any infiltration of moisture. Besides all this the shafts, which are  sunk in pairs, are surrounded with broken pottery. How ingenious and  practical this system was, we see from the fact that both the coffins  and their contents are found in a state of perfect dryness and  preservation. (Fig. 41, p. 90.)    [Illustration: 39.--SEPULCHRAL VAULT AT MUGHEIR. (Taylor.)]    [Illustration: 40.--STONE JARS FROM GRAVES. (LARSAM.) (Hommel.)]    28. In fact the Chaldeans, if they could not reach such perfection as  the Assyrians in slab-sculpture, on account of not having stone either  at home or within easy reach, seem to have derived a greater variety of  architectural ornaments from that inexhaustible material of  theirs--baked clay or terra-cotta. We see an instance of it in  remnants--unfortunately very small ones, of some walls belonging to that  same city of Erech. On one of the mounds Loftus was puzzled by the large  quantity of small terra-cotta cones, whole and in fragments, lying about  on the ground. The thick flat end of them was painted red, black or  white. What was his amazement when he stumbled on a piece of wall (some  seven feet in height and not more than thirty in length), which showed  him what their use had been. They were grouped into a variety of  patterns to decorate the entire wall, being stuck with their thin end  into a layer of soft clay with which it was coated for the purpose.  Still more original and even rather incomprehensible is a wall  decoration consisting of several bands, composed each of three rows of  small pots or cups--about four inches in diameter--stuck into the soft  clay coating in the same manner, with the mouth turned outward of  course! Loftus found such a wall, but unfortunately has given no design  of it. (Figures 43 and 44.)    [Illustration: 41.--DRAIN IN MOUND. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    29. As to the ancient Babylonian, or rather Chaldean, art in sculpture,  the last word has by no means been said on that subject. Discoveries  crowd in every year, constantly leading to the most unexpected  conclusions. Thus, it was long an accepted fact that Assyria had very  few statues and Babylonia none at all, when a few years ago (1881),  what should a French explorer, Mr. E. De Sarzec, French consul in Basra,  bring home but nine magnificent statues made of a dark, nearly black  stone as hard as granite, called diorite.[S] Unfortunately they are all  headless; but, as though to make up for this mutilation, one head was  found separate,--a shaved and turbaned head beautifully preserved and of  remarkable workmanship, the very pattern of the turban being plain  enough to be reproduced by any modern loom.[T] These large prizes were  accompanied by a quantity of small works of art representing both men  and animals, of a highly artistic design and some of them of exquisite  finish of execution. This astounding find, the result of several years'  indefatigable work, now gracing the Assyrian rooms of the Louvre in  Paris, comes from one of the Babylonian mounds which had not been opened  before, the ruins of a mighty temple at a place now called TELL-LOH, and  supposed to be the site of SIR-BURLA, or SIR-GULLA, one of the most  ancient cities of Chaldea. This \"Sarzec-collection,\" as it has come to  be generally called, not only entirely upsets the ideas which had been  formed on Old-Chaldean art, but is of immense historical importance from  the inscriptions which cover the back of every statue, (not to speak of  the cylinders and other small objects,) and which, in connection with  the monuments of other ruins, enable scholars to fix, at least  approximately, the date at which flourished the city and rulers who have  left such extraordinary memorials of their artistic gifts. Some place  them at about 4500 B.C., others about 4000. However overwhelming such a  valuation may be at first sight, it is not an unsupported fancy, but  proofs concur from many sides to show that the builders and sculptors of  Sir-gulla could in no case have lived and worked much later than 4000  B.C. It is impossible to indicate in a few lines all the points, the  conjectures, the vexed questions, on which this discovery sheds light  more or less directly, more or less decisively; they come up continually  as the study of those remote ages proceeds, and"]]]
