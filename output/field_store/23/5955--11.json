We cantered along in the midst of the great harmonious silence of  populous fields; the locusts waltzed in the sun, the little mere-cats  stood and watched us for a moment and then scampered into their holes;  the ants were toiling busily beneath a thousand heaps. The plain  stretched to the horizon, with the stone-covered kopjes standing out  like larger ant-heaps.    Something sang in the sunny air above my head, and I flicked with my  whip to drive the locust away. Immediately afterwards I heard the sharp  double report of a Mauser, like a postman's knock, and after that again  the shrill moan, infinitely melancholy, of a flying bullet; and away to  my left, about two hundred yards, the sand rose in a fountain. It was my  first experience under fire, and I confess that for ten seconds I gave  myself up. During those ten seconds I was altogether absorbed in  watching a mere-cat trying to roll something into his house; then I  began to see that I was not in any particular danger at so extreme a  range, and I lost my interest in the mere-cat. But for all that my pony  had to do his best over the space that separated us from the picket.  There were a few more shots, and always the shrill moan, but in two  minutes we were behind the shelter of the little hill.    I climbed up its steep side and found the handful of men, with an  officer, lying among the stones on the windy height. There is no  comfort in picket work. This officer and his men had to lie for  twenty-four hours at a time without shelter from sun or rain, and with  nothing to eat but bully beef and hard-tack biscuits. Always their  glasses were sweeping the enemy's position, as the officer on a ship's  bridge examines the horizon; every little movement of men or cattle was  carefully noted.    Presently I had an illustration of the spirit in which lives are taken  in war, a demonstration of what had been happening to myself a few  minutes before. Out of the shoulder of a hill three Boers came on  ponies, and began to walk leisurely across to the next kopje. Now  immediately in front of our hill was another and smaller one, too  inconsiderable to be occupied permanently, but useful for commanding the  Boer front at rifle range. As we lay watching the three specks crossing  the field, \"Sergeant,\" said the officer, \"take a few men down to that  kopje, and see if you can't get a shot at the fellows.\" And off went the  sergeant and a dozen men, as pleased as Punch.    Some time elapsed before they reached the hillock, and still the three  Boers moved slowly and unsuspectingly across our view. After an anxious  pause the rifles cracked out, one after another, like a rip-rap, and at  the same time the Boers seemed to fly instead of to crawl. I then saw  through my glasses that one of the men pitched backwards from his horse,  which still fled, riderless now, beside the others, who were soon out of  range. The men beside me cheered, but ten minutes ago I had been in a  position exactly similar to that of the Boers; we are all egoists in  such a case; it was myself that I saw out in the plain, my own pony  rushing away scared; and I did not join in the acclamations. But all is  changed in war-time; men are no more than game; the excitement is the  old savage one--the lust of blood and the chase.    Late on the Tuesday night we heard that the attack was to be made early  on the morrow. So we rose at three and rode out in the starlight through  the busy camp, where the flashlights were talking and the fires blazing.  I rode round to the south about eight miles, and presently the whole  Boer position stood out black before the fires of dawn, and when the sun  came up it showed one division of our troops--the Sixth--creeping round  to the south where the enemy's position terminated in seven small  kopjes. It was beautiful to see the division advance down the slope with  the screen of mounted infantry opening out in front like a fan, with  another and more slender screen, like another fan, in front of them  again.    The sun was well up, but I had not yet heard a gun go off. Presently  there was a report, and the sand rose in a column before the kopjes.  This was a 4.7 naval gun finding its range with common shell. Again the  invisible gun behind me boomed, again the weird, prolonged whirtling  overhead; the long wait--perhaps for fifteen seconds; then a cloud of  hideous vapour right on the kopje; then the report of the exploding  shell. This happened perhaps half a dozen times; the well-aimed shells  dropped now behind, now on the hills; there was no reply; and in half an  hour the mounted infantry were riding over the kopjes. The enemy had  simply broken and fled towards their central position.    From the north side, where the Ninth and Seventh Divisions were, one  could hear the same sounds, but no rifle fire. After our guns had  cleared the seven kopjes a kind of Sabbath stillness fell upon the land.    Lying in the grass, listening to the droning flies, I tried to tell  myself that I was watching a momentous battle; that matters of life and  death were on hand: but the wind laughed through the grasses at the very  notion, and the timid steinbuck leaped up quite close to me, as if to  say, \"Who's afraid?\"    Behind me a brigade was winding to the south with a movement almost  lyrical; but no man seemed to be doing anything that could be called  fighting. I decided that nothing more was to be seen on the south, and  started to cross northward between the positions. My path was in what  ought to have been the hottest zone of fire; but the hares leapt in the  sun and the grasshoppers hummed with delight. While crossing northward I  met the advance scouts of a regiment of mounted infantry advancing  where, according to all ordinary laws, no mounted infantry could or  ought to have been--advancing directly on the central Boer position.    \"Come along,\" said the Colonel; \"I believe the whole position is empty;  we're going to scale those ridges.\"    Now these very ridges were the ones to which I had seen the Boers  retreat, about a thousand of them, half an hour ago, and I told the  Colonel so. \"But they must have gone,\" he said, \"or else they would be  firing at us now.\"    It was perfectly true. The whole company was halted, while we chatted,  within easy fire of the enemy's position; a few pom-poms would have made  a shocking mess amongst the men and horses. But the hills were clothed  with silence as with a garment.    \"Anyhow, I'm going to see,\" said the Colonel. \"Come along.\"    So we cantered on up to the foot of the hill, up the slope, over the  hill, and not a shot was fired at us. The excitement was tremendous; we  were riding slap into what looked like a hornets' nest. There were  kopjes flanking us now on both sides; I wished that I hadn't come. I  expected every moment to hear the rattle of Mausers. Someone's horse  kicked a tin can, and we ducked our heads like one man. But we rode up  to and into and through and over the central position of the enemy that  he had been strengthening for days; and he never fired a shot to prevent  us. It was glorious luck, thus to be in the very front of an advancing  force, to be on the very horns of the advance, and to be absolutely out  of danger, for what little opposition there was was encountered later by  the main body.    When I thought that I had advanced far enough into what ought to have  been the jaws of death, I drew on one side and let the brigade go past,  and then I saw what little firing there was. Behind the mounted infantry  came the field-guns, galloping alone over the smooth ground; and  presently we heard the report of a gun from the other side of the next  eastward ridge over which the enemy had retired. It is very  uncomfortable waiting for a shell to arrive. One has only the sound to  guide one as to where it has come from, and one has no notion at all as  to where it is going to strike. This one burst right amongst the  galloping artillery, which at once opened out on both sides of a smoking  patch. Not a man or horse was down. And here the Boers lost their big  chance of the day. All the brigade had to advance through this one  narrow pass between the kopjes; the Boers had got the range of it  absolutely; if they had fired a dozen shells in quick succession they  would have done a dismal amount of mischief. But they only fired two  other shells, and, marvellously, no one was hit. The reason I believe to  have been that the dust of their own retreat, which hung like a haze  over the ridge, hid our advancing troops from the Boers, and they did  not know whether or not anyone was under their fire.    In the meantime the Ninth Brigade had been doing just the same kind of  thing on the north river bank; and when the attack (such as it was--a  gentle shelling) was being pressed there, General French came up from  the south-east and drove the enemy northward across the river. If French  had been a little earlier we should have cut off the Boers at the river,  for that was their only line of retreat. As it was, he came in time to  chase them; and when we heard of him again he was in full cry on the  road to Bloemfontein.    It was a strange engagement; an almost bloodless battle; a great  spectacle like an Aldershot Field Day; a demonstration of forces far  stronger than the mere force of arms--confidence on the one hand, and on  the other demoralisation and a broken spirit.          X    THE MARCH ON DREIFONTEIN      Early on the morning after the Osfontein engagement the army was again  upon the march, and towards afternoon reached a farm called Poplar  Grove, the point on which our left flank had rested on the day before.  That was only a ten-mile journey, but men and beasts were tired, and a  longer distance would have tried them severely. We rested a whole day at  Poplar Grove, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2388"],[0,"The Song Celestial; Or, Bhagavad-Gîtâ (from the Mahâbhârata) (#13)"],[1,"His natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame!
