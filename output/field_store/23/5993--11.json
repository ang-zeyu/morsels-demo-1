She talked  little, leaving the conversation to Aunt Lucy and myself, though she  occasionally dropped in an apt word. Toward the end of the meal,  however, she caught hold of an unfortunate opinion I had incautiously  advanced and tore it into tatters. The result was a spirited argument,  in which Miss Gussie held her own with such ability that I was utterly  routed and found another grievance against her. It was very  humiliating to be worsted by a girl--a country girl at that, who had  passed most of her life on a farm! No doubt she was strong-minded and  wanted to vote. I was quite prepared to believe anything of her.    After tea Miss Ashley proposed a walk around the premises, in order to  initiate me into my duties. Apart from his farm, Mr. Ashley owned  large grist-and saw-mills and did a flourishing business, with the  details of which Miss Gussie seemed so conversant that I lost all  doubt of her ability to run the whole thing as she had claimed. I felt  quite ignorant in the light of her superior knowledge, and our walk  was enlivened by some rather too lively discussions between us. We  walked about together, however, till the shadows of the firs by the  mills stretched nearly across the pond and the white moon began to put  on a silvery burnish. Then we wound up by a bitter dispute, during  which Gussie's eyes were very black and each cheek had a round, red  stain on it. She had a little air of triumph at having defeated me.    \"I have to go now and see about putting away the milk, and I dare say  you're not sorry to be rid of me,\" she said, with a demureness I had  not credited her with, \"but if you come to the verandah in half an  hour I'll bring you out a glass of new milk and some pound cake I made  today by a recipe that's been in the family for one hundred years, and  I hope it will choke you for all the snubs you've been giving me.\" She  walked away after this amiable wish, and I stood by the pond till the  salmon tints faded from its waters and stars began to mirror  themselves brokenly in its ripples. The mellow air was full of sweet,  mingled eventide sounds as I walked back to the house. Aunt Lucy was  knitting on the verandah. Gussie brought out cake and milk and chatted  to us while we ate, in an inconsequent girlish way, or fed bits of  cake to a green-eyed goblin in the likeness of a black cat.    She appeared in such an amiable light that I was half inclined to  reconsider my opinion of her. When I went to my room the vase full of  crimson leaves on my table suggested Gussie, and I repented of my  unfriendliness for a moment--and only for a moment. Gussie and her  mother passed through the hall below, and Aunt Lucy's soft voice  floated up through my half-open door.    \"Well, how do you like your cousin, my dear?\"    Whereat that decided young lady promptly answered, \"I think he is the  most conceited youth I've met for some time.\"    Pleasant, wasn't it? I thought of Nellie's meek admiration of all my  words and ways, and got her photo out to soothe my vanity. For the  first time it struck me that her features were somewhat insipid. The  thought seemed like disloyalty, so I banished it and went to bed.    I expected to dream of that disagreeable Gussie, but I did not, and I  slept so soundly that it was ten o'clock the next morning before I  woke. I sprang out of bed in dismay, dressed hastily, and ran down,  not a little provoked at myself. Through the window I saw Gussie in  the garden digging up some geraniums. She was enveloped in a  clay-stained brown apron, a big flapping straw hat half hid her face,  and she wore a pair of muddy old kid gloves. Her whole appearance was  disreputable, and the face she turned to me as I said \"Good morning\"  had a diagonal streak of clay across it. I added slovenliness to my  already long list of her demerits.    \"Good afternoon, rather. Don't you know what time it is? The men were  here three hours ago for their orders. I thought it a pity to disturb  your peaceful dreams, so I gave them myself and sent them off.\"    I was angrier than ever. A nice beginning I had made. And was that  girl laughing at me?    \"I expected to be called in time, certainly,\" I said stiffly. \"I am  not accustomed to oversleep myself. I promise it will not occur  again.\"    My dignity was quite lost on Gussie. She peeled off her gloves  cheerfully and said, \"I suppose you'd like some breakfast. Just wait  till I wash my hands and I'll get you some. Then if you're pining to  be useful you can help me take up these geraniums.\"    There was no help for it. After I had breakfasted I went, with many  misgivings. We got on fairly well, however. Gussie was particularly  lively and kept me too busy for argument. I quite enjoyed the time and  we did not quarrel until nearly the last, when we fell out bitterly  over some horticultural problem and went in to dinner in sulky  silence. Gussie disappeared after dinner and I saw no more of her. I  was glad of this, but after a time I began to find it a little dull.  Even a dispute would have been livelier. I visited the mills, looked  over the farm, and then carelessly asked Aunt Lucy where Miss Ashley  was. Aunt Lucy replied that she had gone to visit a friend and would  not be back till the next day.    This was satisfactory, of course, highly so. What a relief it was to  be rid of that girl with her self-assertiveness and independence. I  said to myself that I hoped her friend would keep her for a week. I  forgot to be disappointed that she had not when, next afternoon, I saw  Gussie coming in at the gate with a tolerably large satchel and an  armful of golden rod. I sauntered down to relieve her, and we had a  sharp argument under way before we were halfway up the lane. As usual  Gussie refused to give in that she was wrong.    Her walk had brought a faint, clear tint to her cheeks and her  rippling dusky hair had half slipped down on her neck. She said she  had to make some cookies for tea and if I had nothing better to do I  might go and talk to her while she mixed them. It was not a gracious  invitation but I went, rather than be left to my own company.    By the end of the week I was as much at home at Ashley Mills as if I  had lived there all my life. Gussie and I were thrown together a good  deal, for lack of other companions, and I saw no reason to change my  opinion of her. She could be lively and entertaining when she chose,  and at times she might be called beautiful. Still, I did not approve  of her--at least I thought so, most of the time. Once in a while came  a state of feeling which I did not quite understand.    One evening I went to prayer meeting with Aunt Lucy and Gussie. I had  not seen the minister of Ashley Mills before, though Gussie and her  mother seemed to know him intimately. I had an idea that he was old  and silvery-haired and benevolent-looking. So I was rather surprised  to find him as young as myself--a tall, pale, intellectual-looking  man, with a high, white brow and dark, earnest eyes--decidedly  attractive.    I was still more surprised when, after the service, he joined Gussie  at the door and went down the steps with her. I felt distinctly  ill-treated as I fell back with Aunt Lucy. There was no reason why I  should--none; it ought to have been a relief. Rev. Carroll Martin had  every right to see Miss Ashley home if he chose. Doubtless a girl who  knew all there was to be known about business, farming, and milling,  to say nothing of housekeeping and gardening, could discuss theology  also. It was none of my business.    I don't know what kept me awake so late that night. As a consequence I  overslept myself. I had managed to redeem my reputation on this point,  but here it was lost again. I felt cross and foolish and cantankerous  when I went out.    There was some unusual commotion at the well. It was an old-fashioned  open one, with a chain and windlass. Aunt Lucy was peering anxiously  down its mouth, from which a ladder was sticking. Just as I got there  Gussie emerged from its depths with a triumphant face. Her skirt was  muddy and draggled, her hair had tumbled down, and she held a dripping  black cat.    \"Coco must have fallen into the well last night,\" she explained, as I  helped her to the ground. \"I missed him at milking-time, and when I  came to the well this morning I heard the most ear-splitting yowls  coming up from it. I couldn't think where he could possibly be, for  the water was quite calm, until I saw he had crept into a little  crevice in the stones on the side. So I got a ladder and went down  after him.\"    \"You should have called me,\" I said sourly. \"You might have killed  yourself, going down there.\"    \"And Coco might have tumbled in and drowned while you were getting  up,\" retorted Gussie. \"Besides, what was the need? I could go down as  well as you.\"    \"No doubt,\" I said, more sharply than I had any business to. \"I don't  dream of disputing your ability to do anything you may take it into  your head to do. Most young ladies are not in the habit of going down  wells, however.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" she rejoined, with freezing calmness. \"But, as you may  have discovered, I am not 'most young ladies.' I am myself, Augusta  Ashley, and accountable to nobody but myself if I choose to go down  the well every day for pure love of it.\"    She walked off in her wet dress with her muddy cat. Gussie Ashley was  the only girl I ever saw who could be dignified under such  circumstances.    I was in a very bad humour with myself as I went off to see about  having the well cleaned out. I had offended Gussie and I knew she  would not be easily appeased. Nor was she. For a week she kept me  politely, studiously, at a distance, in spite of my most humble  advances. Rev. Carroll was a frequent caller, ostensibly to make  arrangements about a Sunday school they were organizing in a poor part  of the community. Gussie and he held long conversations on this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#13)"],[1,"in expensive gowns and  hats, and looking, as they felt, very much on the outside of things.  They brightened and bridled, however, when Mrs. Gardiner brought Mary  Seymour up and introduced her. If there was one thing on earth that  the Reed girls longed for more than another it was to \"get in\" with  the Seymour girls.    After Mary had chatted with them for a few minutes in a friendly way,  she said, \"I think we have a mutual friend in Miss Sally Temple of  Golden Gate, haven't we? I'm sure I've heard her speak of you.\"    The Reed girls flushed. They did not care to have the rich Seymour  girls know of their connection with that queer old cousin of their  father's who lived in that out-of-the-world spot up-country.    \"She is a distant cousin of ours,\" said Beatrice carelessly, \"but  we've never met her.\"    \"Oh, how much you have missed!\" said Mary frankly. \"She is the  sweetest and most charming little lady I have ever met, and I am proud  to number her among my friends. Golden Gate is such an idyllic little  spot, too. We go there so often that I fear Miss Sally will think we  mean to outwear our welcome. We hope to have her visit us in town this  winter. Well, good-by for now. I'll tell Miss Sally I've met you. She  will be pleased to hear about you.\"    When Mary had gone, the Reed girls looked at each other.    \"I suppose we ought to have gone to see Cousin Sally before,\" said  Beatrice. \"Father said we ought to.\"    \"How on earth did the Seymours pick her up?\" said Helen. \"Of course we  must go and see her.\"    Go they did. The very next day Miss Sally's cup of happiness brimmed  right over, for Cousin Abner's girls came to Golden Gate at last. They  were very nice to her, too. Indeed, in spite of a good deal of  snobbishness and false views of life, they were good-hearted girls  under it all; and some plain common sense they had inherited from  their father came to the surface and taught them to see that Miss  Sally was a relative of whom anyone might be proud. They succumbed to  her charm, as the others had done, and thoroughly enjoyed their visit  to Golden Gate. They went away promising to come often again; and I  may say right here that they kept their promise, and a real friendship  grew up between Miss Sally and \"Cousin Abner's girls\" that was  destined to work wonders for the latter, not only socially and  mentally but spiritually as well, for it taught them that sincerity  and honest kindliness of heart and manner are the best passports  everywhere, and that pretence of any kind is a vulgarity not to be  tolerated. This took time, of course. The Reed girls could not discard  their snobbishness all at once. But in the end it was pretty well  taken out of them.    Miss Sally never dreamed of this or the need for it. She loved Cousin  Abner's girls from the first and always admired them exceedingly.    \"And then it is so good to have your own folks coming as company,\" she  told the Seymour girls. \"Oh, I'm just in the seventh heaven of  happiness. But, dearies, I think you will always be my favourites--mine  and Juliana's. I've plenty of company now and it's all thanks to you.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said Mary quickly. \"Miss Sally, your company comes to you  for just your own sake. You've made Golden Gate a veritable Mecca for  us all. You don't know and you never will know how much good you have  done us. You are so good and true and sweet that we girls all feel as  if we were bound to live up to you, don't you see? And we all love  you, Miss Sally.\"    \"I'm so glad,\" breathed Miss Sally with shining eyes, \"and so is  Juliana.\"          Mrs. March's Revenge      \"I declare, it is a real fall day,\" said Mrs. Stapp, dropping into a  chair with a sigh of relief as Mrs. March ushered her into the cosy  little sitting-room. \"The wind would chill the marrow in your bones;  winter'll be here before you know it.\"    \"That's so,\" assented Mrs. March, bustling about to stir up the fire.  \"But I don't know as I mind it at all. Winter is real pleasant when it  does come, but I must say, I don't fancy these betwixt-and-between  days much. Sit up to the fire, Theodosia. You look real blue.\"    \"I feel so too. Lawful heart, but this is comfort. This chimney-corner  of yours, Anna, is the cosiest spot in the world.\"    \"When did you get home from Maitland?\" asked Mrs. March. \"Did you  have a pleasant time? And how did you leave Emily and the children?\"    Mrs. Stapp took this trio of interrogations in calm detail.    \"I came home Saturday,\" she said, as she unrolled her knitting. \"Nice  wet day it was too! And as for my visit, yes, I enjoyed myself pretty,  well, not but what I worried over Peter's rheumatism a good deal.  Emily is well, and the children ought to be, for such rampageous young  ones I never saw! Emily can't do no more with them than an old hen  with a brood of ducks. But, lawful heart, Anna, don't mind about my  little affairs! The news Peter had for me about you when I got home  fairly took my breath. He came down to the garden gate to shout it  before I was out of the wagon. I couldn't believe but what he was  joking at first. You should have seen Peter. He had an old red shawl  tied round his rheumatic shoulder, and he was waving his arms like a  crazy man. I declare, I thought the chimney was afire! Theodosia,  Theodosia!' he shouted. 'Anna March has had a fortune left her by her  brother in Australy, and she's bought the old Carroll place, and is  going to move up there!' That was his salute when I got home. I'd have  been over before this to hear all about it, but things were at such  sixes and sevens in the house that I couldn't go visiting until I'd  straightened them out a bit. Peter's real neat, as men go, but, lawful  heart, such a mess as he makes of housekeeping! I didn't know you had  a brother living.\"    \"No more did I, Theodosia. I thought, as everyone else did, that poor  Charles was at the bottom of the sea forty years ago. It's that long  since he ran away from home. He had a quarrel with Father, and he was  always dreadful high-spirited. He went to sea, and we heard that he  had sailed for England in the _Helen Ray_. She was never heard of  after, and we all supposed that my poor brother had perished with her.  And four weeks ago I got a letter from a firm of lawyers in Melbourne,  Australia, saying that my brother, Charles Bennett, had died and left  all his fortune to me. I couldn't believe it at first, but they sent  me some things of his that he had when he left home, and there was an  old picture of myself among them with my name written on it in my own  hand, so then I knew there was no mistake. But whether Charles did  sail in the _Helen Ray_, or if he did, how he escaped from her and got  to Australia, I don't know, and it isn't likely I ever will.\"    \"Well, of all wonderful things!\" commented Mrs. Stapp.    \"I was glad to hear that I was heir to so much money,\" said Mrs. March  firmly. \"At first I felt as if it were awful of me to be glad when it  came to me by my brother's death. But I mourned for poor Charles forty  years ago, and I can't sense that he has only just died. Not but what  I'd rather have seen him come home alive than have all the money in  the world, but it has come about otherwise, and as the money is  lawfully mine, I may as well feel pleased about it.\"    \"And you've bought the Carroll place,\" said Mrs. Stapp, with the  freedom of a privileged friend. \"Whatever made you do it? I'm sure you  are as cosy here as need be, and nobody but yourself. Isn't this house  big enough for you?\"    \"No, it isn't. All my life I've been hankering for a good, big, roomy  house, and all my life I've had to put up with little boxes of places,  not big enough to turn round in. I've been contented, and made the  best of what I had, but now that I can afford it, I mean to have a  house that will suit me. The Carroll house is just what I want, for  all it is a little old-fashioned. I've always had a notion of that  house, although I never expected to own it any more than the moon.\"    \"It's a real handsome place,\" admitted Mrs. Stapp, \"but I expect it  will need a lot of fixing up. Nobody has lived in it for six years.  When are you going to move in?\"    \"In about three weeks, if all goes well. I'm having it all painted and  done over inside. The outside can wait until the spring.\"    \"It's queer how things come about,\" said Mrs. Stapp meditatively. \"I  guess old Mrs. Carroll never imagined her home was going to pass into  other folks' hands as it has. When you and I were girls, and Louise  Carroll was giving herself such airs over us, you didn't much expect  to ever stand in her shoes, did you? Do you remember Lou?\"    \"Yes, I do,\" said Mrs. March sharply. A change came over her sonsy,  smiling face. It actually looked hard and revengeful, and a cruel  light flickered in her dark brown eyes. \"I'll not forget Lou Carroll  as long as I live. She is the only person in this world I ever hated.  I suppose it is sinful to say it, but I hate her still, and always  will.\"    \"I never liked her myself,\" admitted Mrs. Stapp. \"She thought herself  above us all. Well, for that matter I suppose she was--but she needn't  have rubbed it in so.\"    \"Well, she might have been above me,\" said Mrs. March bitterly, \"but  she wasn't above twitting and snubbing me every chance she got. She  always had a spite at me from the time we were children together at  school. When we grew up it was worse. I couldn't begin to tell you all  the times that girl insulted me. But there was once in particular--I'll  never forgive her for it. I was at a party, and she was there too, and  so was that young Trenham Manning, who was visiting the Ashleys. Do you  remember him, Dosia? He was a handsome young fellow, and Lou had a  liking for him, so all the girls said. But he never looked at her that  night, and he kept by me the whole time. It made Lou furious, and at  last she came up to me with a sneer on"]]]
