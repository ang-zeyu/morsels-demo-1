He held a private conversation with the coachman    as to how his journeyman had set to work with the lady,    and what he had done to her, and then he thought:--      \"So be it! I'll do the same. If I fall on my feet, good; if    I don't, well, I must suffer all the same!\"      So he set to work at once, stripped the seigneur naked, laid    hold of him by the legs with the tongs, popped him into the    furnace, and began blowing the bellows. After he had burnt    him to a cinder, he collected his remains, flung them into the    milk, and then waited to see how soon a youthful seigneur    would jump out of it. He waited one hour, two hours. But    nothing came of it. He made a search in the tub. There was    nothing in it but bones, and those charred ones.      Just then the lady sent messengers to the smithy, to ask    whether the seigneur would soon be ready. The poor Smith    had to reply that the seigneur was no more.      When the lady heard that the Smith had only turned her    husband into a cinder, instead of making him young, she was    tremendously angry, and she called together her trusty servants,    and ordered them to drag him to the gallows. No sooner said    than done. Her servants ran to the Smith's house, laid hold of    him, tied his hands together, and dragged him off to the gallows.    All of a sudden there came up with them the youngster    who used to live with the Smith as his journeyman, who asked    him:--      \"Where are they taking you, master?\"      \"They're going to hang me,\" replied the Smith, and straightway    related all that had happened to him.      \"Well, uncle!\" said the Demon, \"swear that you will never    strike me with your hammer, but that you will pay me the same    respect your father always paid, and the seigneur shall be alive,    and young, too, in a trice.\"      The Smith began promising and swearing that he would    never again lift his hammer against the Demon, but would    always pay him every attention. Thereupon the journeyman    hastened to the smithy, and shortly afterwards came back again,    bringing the seigneur with him, and crying to the servants:      \"Hold! hold! Don't hang him! Here's your master!\"      Then they immediately untied the cords, and let the Smith    go free.      From that time forward the Smith gave up spitting at the    Demon and striking him with his hammer. The journeyman    disappeared, and was never seen again. But the seigneur and    his lady entered upon a prosperous course of life, and if they    haven't died, they're living still.[71]    FOOTNOTES:    [11] Dasent's \"Popular Tales from the Norse,\" p. xl.

[27] In West-European stories the devil frequently carries off a  witch's soul after death. Here the fiend enters the corpse, or rather  its skin, probably intending to reappear as a vampire. Compare Bleek's  \"Reynard the Fox in South Africa,\" No. 24, in which a lion squeezes  itself into the skin of a girl it has killed. I have generally  rendered by \"demon,\" instead of \"devil,\" the word _chort_ when it  occurs in stories of this class, as the spirits to which they refer  are manifestly akin to those of oriental demonology.    [28] For an account of which, see the \"Songs of the Russian People,\"  pp. 333-334. The best Russian work on the subject is Barsof's  \"Prichitaniya Syevernago Kraya,\" Moscow, 1872.

[47] In the sixty-fourth story of Asbjoernsen's \"Norske Folke-Eventyr,\"  (Ny Samling, 1871) the dispute between the husband and wife is about a  cornfield--as to whether it should be reaped or shorn--and she tumbles  into a pool while she is making clipping gestures \"under her husband's  nose.\" In the old fabliau of \"Le Pre Tondu\" (Le Grand d'Aussy,  Fabliaux, 1829, iii. 185), the husband cuts out the tongue of his  wife, to prevent her from repeating that his meadow has been clipped,  whereupon she makes a clipping sign with her fingers. In Poggio's  \"Facetiae,\" the wife is doubly aggravating.

[54] This story is known to the Finns, but with them the Russian  Demon, (_chortenok_ = a little _chort_ or devil), has become the  Plague. In the original Indian story the demon is one which had  formerly lived in a Brahman's house, but had been frightened away by  his cantankerous wife. In the Servian version (Karajich, No. 37), the  opening consists of the \"Scissors-story,\" to which allusion has  already been made. The vixen falls into a hole which she does not see,  so bent is she on controverting her husband.    [55] Afanasief, ii. No. 12. Written down by a \"Crown Serf,\" in the  government of Perm.    [56] Afanasief, viii. No. 20. A copeck is worth about a third of a  penny.    [57] The story is continued very little further by Afanasief, its  conclusion being the same as that of \"The Wise Wife,\" in Book vii. No.  22, a tale of magic. For a Servian version of the tale see Vuk  Karajich, No. 7.    [58] Afanasief, v. No. 3. From the Novgorod Government.

Phaethon  paused for a moment to admire the beauty of the glittering equipage, the  gift of the god of fire, who had formed it of gold, and ornamented it with  precious stones, which reflected the rays of the sun. And now Helios,  seeing his sister, the Dawn, opening her doors in the rosy east, ordered  the Hours to yoke the horses. The goddesses speedily obeyed the command,  and the father then anointed the face of his son with a sacred balm, to  enable him to endure the burning flames which issued from the nostrils of  the steeds, and sorrowfully placing his crown of rays upon his head,  desired him to ascend the chariot.    The eager youth joyfully took his place and grasped the coveted reins, but  no sooner did the fiery coursers of the sun feel the inexperienced hand  which attempted to guide them, than they became restive and unmanageable.  Wildly they rushed out of their accustomed track, now soaring so high as to  threaten the heavens with destruction, now descending so low as nearly to  set the earth on fire. At last the unfortunate charioteer, blinded with the  glare, and terrified at the awful devastation he had caused, dropped the  reins from his trembling hands. Mountains and forests were in flames,  rivers and streams were dried up, and a general conflagration was imminent.  The scorched earth now called on Zeus for help, who hurled his thunderbolt  at Phaethon, and with a flash of lightning brought the fiery steeds to a  standstill. The lifeless body of the youth fell headlong into the river  Eridanus,[27] where it was received and buried by the {66} nymphs of the  stream. His sisters mourned so long for him that they were transformed by  Zeus into poplars, and the tears they shed, falling into the waters, became  drops of clear, transparent amber. Cycnus, the faithful friend of the  unhappy Phaethon, felt such overwhelming grief at his terrible fate, that  he pined and wasted away. The gods, moved with compassion, transformed him  into a swan, which for ever brooded over the fatal spot where the waters  had closed over the head of his unfortunate friend.    [Illustration]    The chief seat of the worship of Helios was the island of Rhodes, which  according to the following myth was his especial territory. At the time of  the Titanomachia, when the gods were dividing the world by lot, Helios  happened to be absent, and consequently received no share. He, therefore,  complained to Zeus, who proposed to have a new allotment, but this Helios  would not allow, saying, that as he pursued his daily journey, his  penetrating eye had beheld a lovely, fertile island lying beneath the waves  of the ocean, and that if the immortals would swear to give him the  undisturbed possession of this spot, he would be content to accept it as  his share of the universe. The gods took the oath, whereupon the island of  Rhodes immediately raised itself above the surface of the waters.    The famous Colossus of Rhodes, which was one of the seven wonders of the  world, was erected in honour of Helios. This wonderful statue was 105 feet  high, and was formed entirely of brass; it formed the entrance to the  harbour at Rhodes, and the largest vessel could easily sail between the  legs, which stood on moles, each side of the harbour. Though so gigantic,  it was perfectly proportioned in every part. Some idea of {67} its size may  be gained from the fact that very few people were able to span the thumb of  this statue with their arms. In the interior of the Colossus was a winding  staircase leading to the top, from the summit of which, by means of a  telescope, the coast of Syria, and also the shores of Egypt, are said to  have been visible.[28]    EOS (AURORA).    Eos, the Dawn, like her brother Helios, whose advent she always announced,  was also deified by the early Greeks. She too had her own chariot, which  she drove across the vast horizon both morning and night, before and after  the sun-god. Hence she is not merely the personification of the rosy morn,  but also of twilight, for which reason her palace is placed in the west, on  the island AEaea. The abode of Eos is a magnificent structure, surrounded by  flowery meads and velvety lawns, where nymphs and other immortal beings,  wind in and out in the mazy figures of the dance, whilst the music of a  sweetly-tuned melody accompanies their graceful, gliding movements.    Eos is described by the poets as a beautiful maiden with rosy arms and  fingers, and large wings, whose plumage is of an ever-changing hue; she  bears a star on her forehead, and a torch in her hand. Wrapping round her  the rich folds of her violet-tinged mantle, she leaves her couch before the  break of day, and herself yokes her two horses, Lampetus and Phaethon, to  her glorious chariot. She then hastens with active cheerfulness to open the  gates of heaven, in order to herald the approach of her brother, the god of  day, whilst the tender plants and flowers, revived by the morning dew, lift  their heads to welcome her as she passes.    {68}    Eos first married the Titan Astraeus,[29] and their children were Heosphorus  (Hesperus), the evening star, and the winds. She afterwards became united  to Tithonus, son of Laomedon, king of Troy, who had won her affection by  his unrivalled beauty; and Eos, unhappy at the thought of their being ever  separated by death, obtained for him from Zeus the gift of immortality,  forgetting, however, to add to it that of eternal youth. The consequence  was that when, in the course of time, Tithonus grew old and decrepid, and  lost all the beauty which had won her admiration, Eos became disgusted with  his infirmities, and at last shut him up in a chamber, where soon little  else was left of him but his voice, which had now sunk into a weak, feeble  quaver. According to some of the later poets, he became so weary of his  cheerless and miserable existence, that he entreated to be allowed to die.  This was, however, impossible; but Eos, pitying his unhappy condition,  exerted her divine power, and changed him into a grasshopper, which is, as  it were, all voice, and whose monotonous, ceaseless chirpings may not  inaptly be compared to the meaningless babble of extreme old age.    PHOEBUS-APOLLO.    Phoebus-Apollo, the god of Light, Prophecy, Music, Poetry, and the Arts and  Sciences, is by far the noblest conception within the whole range of Greek  mythology, and his worship, which not only extended to all the states of  Greece, but also to Asia Minor and to every Greek colony throughout the  world, stands out among the most ancient and strongly-marked features of  Grecian history, and exerted a more decided influence over the Greek  nation, than that of any other deity, not excepting Zeus himself.    Apollo was the son of Zeus and Leto, and was born beneath the shade of a  palm tree which grew at the foot {69} of Mount Cynthus, on the barren and  rocky island of Delos. The poets tell us that the earth smiled when the  young god first beheld the light of day, and that Delos became so proud and  exultant at the honour thus conferred upon her, that she covered herself  with golden flowers; swans surrounded the island, and the Delian nymphs  celebrated his birth with songs of joy.    [Illustration]    The unhappy Leto, driven to Delos by the relentless persecutions of Hera,  was not long permitted to enjoy her haven of refuge. Being still tormented  by her enemy, the young mother was once more obliged to fly; she therefore  resigned the charge of her new-born babe to the goddess Themis, who  carefully wrapped the helpless infant in swaddling-clothes, and fed him  with nectar and ambrosia; but he had no sooner partaken of the heavenly  food than, to the amazement of the goddess, he burst asunder the bands  which confined his infant limbs, and springing to his feet, appeared before  her as a full-grown youth of divine strength and beauty. He now demanded a  lyre and a bow, declaring that henceforth he would announce to mankind the  will of his father Zeus. \"The golden lyre,\" said he, \"shall be my friend,  the bent bow my delight, and in oracles will I foretell the dark future.\"  With these words he ascended to Olympus, where he was received with joyful  acclamations into the assembly of the celestial gods, who acknowledged him  as the most beautiful and glorious of all the sons of Zeus.    Phoebus-Apollo was the god of light in a twofold {70} signification: first,  as representing the great orb of day which illumines the world; and  secondly, as the heavenly light which animates the soul of man. He  inherited his function as sun-god from Helios, with whom, in later times,  he was so completely identified, that the personality of the one became  gradually merged in that of the other. We, accordingly, find Helios  frequently confounded with Apollo, myths belonging to the former attributed  to the latter; and with some tribes--the Ionic, for instance--so complete  is this identification, that Apollo is called by them Helios-Apollo.    As the divinity whose power is developed in the broad light of day, he  brings joy and delight to nature, and health and prosperity to man. By the  influence of his warm and gentle rays he disperses the noxious vapours of  the night, assists the grain to ripen and the flowers to bloom.    But although, as god of the sun, he is a life-giving and life-preserving  power, who, by his genial influence, dispels the cold of winter, he is, at  the same time, the god who, by means of his fiercely darting rays, could  spread disease and send sudden death to men and animals; and it is to this  phase of his character that we must look for the explanation of his being  considered, in conjunction with his twin-sister, Artemis (as moon-goddess),  a divinity of death. The brother and sister share this function between  them, he taking man and she woman as her aim, and those"]]]
