Then, in running away, the deer may  happen to go just the wrong way--and fall into the tiger's jaws.    Or else it may happen that the deer is so frightened that he loses his  head, as it were, and goes just any way--and by bad luck chooses the  wrong way, and falls into the tiger's jaws.    But I must tell you that, although the tiger tries very hard to eat  the deer, _the deer tries still harder not to be eaten!_ Why? Because  if the tiger does not catch the deer for to-day's dinner, he can still  catch some other animal for tomorrow's breakfast, even if he goes  hungry to-night. But if the deer once gets eaten, there is no  to-morrow for, him at all! The tiger is only trying _to get a meal_,  but the deer is trying _to save his life_. That is why the deer  nearly always gets away from the tiger--because he is trying harder  than the tiger.    So the tiger does not get deer to eat much oftener than most children  get roast turkey. The tiger lives mostly on pork, for the wild pigs of  the jungle are such careless animals, as I have told you before. Now  and again the tiger gets mutton also, for the wild sheep are silly  creatures, like other kinds of sheep. In the same way the tiger  sometimes catches a wild goat.    The tiger would really get deer to eat a little oftener than he  actually does if it were not that the deer has two other gifts by  which he can escape from the tiger at the last minute. Those two gifts  are his _quickness in getting started_, and his _speed in running_.  So, even if the deer makes a mistake and runs toward the tiger, he can  still escape from the tiger if he finds out his mistake in time.    For, as you saw at the midnight pool, the deer may be drinking  quietly, when he hears or smells a tiger. Then the deer can leap at  once and get away, before the tiger can leap. Or it may happen that  the deer is trying to escape from a tiger and has run to within  twenty yards of the tiger, when he finds out his mistake. Then the  deer can turn _at once_ and leap sideways to get out of the tiger's  reach. The deer is so quick that he can turn aside without stopping,  and keep on running.    Then after that, once he has turned away from the tiger, the tiger can  never catch him. For the deer can run ever so much faster than the  tiger.    In fact, the deer or the antelope is the fastest animal in the world,  except one other. About that other animal I shall tell you some  wonderful things in the next book. But among all animals I have told  you about in this book the deer is the fastest.    \"But how do people know that the deer can run faster than other  animals?\" you may ask. \"Has anyone had a race between different  animals?\"    Yes, some people did that in England a few years ago. They took the  fastest racehorse in the country, and ran a race between him and the  fastest greyhound; and the greyhound beat the horse in the race. Then  they took that greyhound, and ran a race between him and an English  deer; and the deer beat the greyhound in the race. So, you see, the  deer was faster than the greyhound, and the greyhound was faster than  the horse! So the deer was the fastest of the three.    And the deer that lives in the jungle is even faster than the English  deer. Why? Because the English deer lives in peaceful glades and  forests, and has no other animal trying to catch and eat him; so he  does not try to be as fast as he could be. But the deer that lives in  the jungle has to try very hard all the time to be as fast as he can  be, or else he would be eaten by the tiger! And, as you must know, _we  can do the best in anything when we try the hardest_.    So, all kinds of wild deer in the jungle have been trying their  hardest to run as fast as they can. And as their fathers and  grandfathers have been trying to do that, the wild deer to-day have  become the fastest runners among all the animals I have told you  about.          CHAPTER XI    The Camel      The _camel_ has very little to do with the kind of jungle I have been  telling you about; but he has much to do with the _desert_. A desert  is another kind of wild place. As I told you before, jungle means any  wild place; but usually, of course, there are lots of trees and bushes  and thickets in it. But we call the wild place a desert when trees and  bushes and thickets will not grow there, because the ground is all  covered with _sand_. In the desert there is nothing but sand all over  the ground, and not a single tree or a tiny blade of grass anywhere,  as far as you can see.    And that is the place where camels can do some very wonderful things,  as I shall now tell you. The camels do not actually live in the desert  all the time, but in countries quite near there.    First I must tell you that there is only one country to-day, called  Central Asia, where camels are still found wild. In all other places  they are not wild any more, for in those countries people have lived  for many thousand years; so the people caught all the camels once upon  a time, and tamed them.    Since that time the camels have been used by people in those countries  for their work, just as we use horses here; and rich people in those  countries count their wealth by the number of camels they have. Just  as we say here that a rich man has a million dollars, or two millions,  or three millions, so in those countries a man is thought to be rich  who has one thousand camels, or two thousand, or three thousand.    It was just the same in those countries in olden times. You have read  in your Bible history that Job was once a rich man, as he owned  thousands of camels.    You will see from the pictures facing page 128 that there are two  kinds of camels; one kind has a huge hump on the middle of his back;  and the other kind has two humps, with a gap between. The _One-Hump  camel_ is called an _Arabian camel_, or a _dromedary_. Once upon a  time he lived in the country called Arabia; that is the country from  where you get your lovely old stories of Ali Baba and Aladdin. But now  the One-Hump camel also lives in other countries near there. These  are all very hot countries, with many miles of desert here and there.    The _Two-Humps camel_ is called a _Bactrian camel_, as he lives in a  country which was once called Bactria. That country also has many  deserts, like Arabia; but as it is far to the north of Arabia, it is  very cold in winter, and the snow then lies very thick on the ground.  So try and remember this:    The One-Hump camel lives in a country where there are many miles of  desert, and where it is very hot almost the whole year. So the  One-Hump camel has to guard himself only from the _hot burning sand_.    The Two-Humps camel lives in a country where there are also many miles  of desert, but where it is very hot in the summer and very cold in the  winter. So the Two-Humps camel has to guard himself from the _hot  burning sand in the summer_, and from the _cold and snow in the  winter_.    The Two-Humps camel has in winter a coat of long, shaggy hair on his  back to guard him from the cold; and in summer the shaggy hair comes  off his back, just as if he were to cast off his thick coat. But the  One-Hump camel has only short hair, as the country is too hot all the  time to need a thick coat.    [Illustration: Bactrian Camel--with Two Humps]    [Illustration: Arabian Camel--with One Hump]    Now I must tell you how camels are used. First, they carry goods for  trade. In those countries there are hardly any railroads, so the  merchants carry their packages on camels. Of course they could not put  a package right on a camel's hump, as it would fall off; so they  always join two packages together with a band or belt, and sling the  band across the camel's back, so that there is a package on each side  of the camel.    When a One-Hump camel is used, the band or belt has two parts, like a  loop; and the loop rests over the hump, so that the band cannot slip  backward or forward. When a Two-Humps camel is used, the band of  course rests in the gap between the two humps, so that it cannot slip  at all; and then the two packages can be made very big. That is why  people like the Two-Humps camel better for carrying goods, and like  the One-Hump camel better for riding. But in some places the One-Hump  camel is used both for riding and for carrying goods.    In this way merchants carry their goods for many hundred miles across  desert and country. Then sometimes they come to the sea and send the  goods in ships to different countries. That is how you get many of the  figs, dates, and grapes you eat; so the next time you eat them, think  of the patient camel that brought them for you across the desert. That  is why the camel is called the _Ship of the Desert_.    The beautiful carpets and rugs and shawls which you see in rich homes  have also been brought by the patient camels; and some of the lovely  vases and ornaments that rich people have were also carried by camels.  And not only across the desert, but even over ordinary land camels  carry these goods. The camel is such a large animal that he can carry  packages as heavy as four men.    Of course when he carries such a heavy load, he cannot go any faster  than a man's walk; but the camel can keep on walking all day, with  just a short rest once in a while. Those used for riding cannot run as  fast as a horse, but they can keep on running at a steady trot much  longer than a horse, and then after a short rest can start running  again. So by the end of the day a camel can run twice as far as a  horse, and sometimes still farther.      _The Camel's Wonderful Gifts_    Now I am going to tell you of the most wonderful things a camel can  do.    First, I must tell you that no other animal could cross a desert at  all. To begin with, if such an animal as a horse tried to walk on the  sand,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#13)"],[1,"of 4 cts. (for lost time) add 1 ct. for every 20 ft. of  distance away from the stock pile if there is a steep rise in the  runway, but if the runway is level, add 1 ct. for every 30 ft. distance  of haul._    Since loading the barrows, as given above, was 16 cts. per cu. yd., the  total fixed cost is 16 + 4 = 20 cts. per cu. yd., to which is added 1  ct. for every 20 or 30 ft. haul depending on the grade of the runway.    The preceding figures assume the use of plank runways for the  wheelbarrows. These should never be omitted, and the barrows wheeled  over the ground. Even a hard packed earth path in dry weather is  inferior to a plank runway and when the ground is soft or muddy the loss  in efficiency of the men is serious. Where the runway must rise to the  mixing board, give it a slope or grade seldom steeper than 1 in 8, and  if possible flatter. Make a runway on a trestle at least 18 ins. wide,  so that men will be in no danger of falling. See to it, also, that the  planks are so well supported that they do not spring down when walked  over, for a springy plank makes hard wheeling. If the planks are so long  between the \"horses\" or \"bents\" used to support them, that they spring  badly, it is usually a simple matter to nail a cleat across the  underside of the planks and stand an upright strut underneath to support  and stiffen the plank.    When two-wheeled carts of the type shown by Fig. 12 are used the runway  requires two lines of planks.    Two-wheeled carts pushed by hand have been less used for handling  concrete materials than for handling concrete, but for distances from 50  to 150 ft. from stock pile to mixing board such carts are probably  cheaper for transporting materials than are wheelbarrows. These carts  hold generally three wheelbarrow loads and they are handled by one man  practically as rapidly and easily as is a wheelbarrow.    For all distances over 50 ft. from stock pile to mixing board, it is  cheaper to haul materials in one-horse dump carts than it is in  wheelbarrows. A cart should be loaded in 4 minutes and dumped in about 1  minute, making 5 minutes lost time each round trip. It should travel at  a speed of not less than 200 ft. per minute, although it is not unusual  to see variations of 15 or 20 per cent., one way or another, from this  average, depending upon the management of the work. A one-horse cart  will readily carry enough stone and sand to make ½ cu. yd. of concrete,  if the roads are fairly hard and level; and a horse can pull this load  up a 10 per cent. (rise of 1 ft. in 10 ft.) planked roadway provided  with cleats to give a foothold. If a horse, cart and driver can be hired  for 30 cts. per hour, the cost of hauling the materials for 1 cu. yd. of  concrete is given by the following rule:    _To a fixed cost of 5 cts. (for lost time at both ends of haul) add 1  ct. for every 100 ft. of distance from stock pile to mixing board._    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Two-Wheeled Ransome Cart for Hauling Concrete.]    Where carts are used it is possible to locate the stock piles several  hundred feet from the mixing boards without adding materially to the  cost of the concrete. It is well, however, to have the stock piles in  sight of the foreman at the mixing board, so as to insure promptness of  delivery.    ~METHODS AND COST OF MIXING.~--In mixing concrete by hand the materials  are spread in superimposed layers on a mixing board and mixed together  first dry and then with water by turning them with shovels or hoes. The  number of turns, the relative arrangement of the layers, and the  sequence of operations vary in practice with the notions of the  engineer controlling the work. No one mode of procedure in hand mixing  can, therefore, be specified for general application; the following are  representative examples of practice in hand mixing:    Measure the stone in a bottomless box and spread it until its thickness  in inches equals its parts by volume. Measure the sand in a bottomless  box set on the stone and spread the sand evenly over the stone layer.  Place the cement on the sand and spread evenly. Turn the material twice  with a square pointed shovel and then turn it a third time while water  is gently sprinkled on. A fourth turn is made to mix thoroughly the  water and the concrete is then shoveled into barrows, giving it a fifth  turn. Mr. Ernest McCullough, who gives this method, states that it is  the cheapest way to mix concrete by hand and still secure a good quality  of output.    In work done by Mr. H. P. Boardman the sand is measured in a bottomless  box and over it is spread the cement in an even layer. The cement and  sand are mixed dry with hoes, the water is added in pailfuls and the  whole mixed to a uniform porridge-like consistency. Into this thin  mortar all the stone for a batch is dumped, the measuring box is lifted  and the mixture turned by shovels. A pair of shovelers, one on each  side, is started at one end turning the material back and working toward  the opposite end. A second pair of shovelers takes the turned material  and turns it again. The concrete is then shoveled into the barrows by  the wheelers themselves as fast as it is turned the second time. By this  method a good gang of 20 to 25 men, using two boxes, will, Mr. Boardman  states, mix and place 45 to 60 cu. yds. of concrete in 10 hours,  depending on the wheelbarrow travel necessary. Assuming a gang of 25  men, this is a rate of 1.8 to 2.4 cu. yds. per man per 10-hour day,  concrete mixed and placed.    A method somewhat similar to the one just outlined is given by Mr. O. K.  Morgan. A mixing board made of 7/8-in. matched boards nailed to 2×3-in.  sills is used, with a mixing box about 8 ft. long, 4 ft. wide and 10 to  12 ins. deep. This box is set alongside the mixing board and in it the  cement and sand are mixed first dry and then wet; a fairly wet mortar is  made. Meanwhile the stone is spread in an even layer 6 ins. thick on  the mixing board and thoroughly drenched with water. The mortar from the  mixing box is cast by shovels in a fairly even layer over the stone and  the whole is turned two or three times with shovels, generally two turns  are enough. Six men are employed; two prepare the mortar, while four get  the stone in readiness, then all hands finish the operation.    The following method is given by Mr. E. Sherman Gould: Spread the sand  in a thin layer on the mixing board and over it spread the cement. Mix  dry with shovels, using four men, one at each corner, turning outward  and then working back again. Over the dry sand and cement mixture spread  the broken stone which has been previously wetted and on top of the  stone apply water evenly. The water will thus percolate through the  stone without splashing and evenly wet the sand and cement. Finally turn  the whole, using the same number of men and the same mode of procedure  as were used in dry mixing the sand and cement. Mr. Gould states that by  this method the contractor should average 2 cu. yds. of mixed concrete  per man per 10-hour day.    A novel method of hand mixing and an unusual record of output is  described by Maj. H. M. Chittenden, U. S. A., in connection with the  construction of a concrete arch bridge. The mixing was done by hand on a  single board 25 ft. long and sloping slightly from one end to the other.  The materials were dumped together on the upper end of the board.  Sixteen men were stationed along the board, eight on each side. The  first two men turned the mixture dry. Next to them stood a man who  applied the water after each shovelful. The next mixers kept turning the  material along and another waterman assisted in wetting it further down  the board. The men at the end of the board shoveled the concrete into  the carts which took it to the work. Each batch contained 18 cu. ft., or  0.644 cu. yd., and the rate of mixing was 10 cu. yds. per hour, or 6.25  cu. yds. per man per 10-hour day. The work of getting the materials  properly proportioned to the mixing board is not included in this  figure, but the loading of the mixed concrete is included.    It is plain from the foregoing, that specifications for hand mixing  should always state the method to be followed, and particularly the  number of turns necessary. If these matters are not specified the  contractor has to guess at the probable requirements of the engineer.  The authors have known of inspectors demanding from 6 to 9 turns of the  materials when specifications were ambiguous. It should also be made  clear whether or not the final shoveling into the barrows or carts  constitutes a turn, and whether any subsequent shoveling of the concrete  into place constitutes a turn. Inspectors and foremen have frequent  disputes over these questions.    Estimates of the cost of hand mixing may usually be figured upon the  number of times that the materials are to be turned by shovels. A  contractor is seldom required to turn the sand and cement more than  three times dry and three times wet, and then turn the mortar and stone  three times. A willing workman, under a good foreman, will turn over  mortar at the rate of 30 cu. yds. in 10 hours, lifting each shovelful  and casting it into a pile. With wages at $1.50 and six turns, this  means a cost of 5 cts. per cubic yard of mortar for each turn; as there  is seldom more than 0.4 cu. yd. of mortar in a cubic yard of concrete,  we have a cost of 2 cts. per cubic yard of concrete for each turn that  is given the mortar. So if the mortar is given six turns before the  stone is added and then the stone and mortar are mixed by three turns we  have: (2 cts. × 6) + (5 cts. × 3) = 12 + 15 = 27 cts. per cubic yard for  mixing concrete. In pavement foundation work two turns of the mortar  followed by two turns of the mortar and stone are considered sufficient.  The cost of mixing per cubic yard of concrete is then (2 cts. × 2) + (5  cts. × 2) = 4 + 10 = 14 cts. per cubic yard of concrete."]]]
