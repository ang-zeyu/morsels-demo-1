It is not at all unlikely that what little of melodic  expression the music of the Greeks had, may have rested to some extent  upon an unconscious perception of these relations, which, although  foreign to their musical theory, may nevertheless have made their way  into the ears of these acute minstrels. The discovery of simple  tonality seems to have been due to the northern minstrels, for it is  here that we find the earliest melodies purely tonalized. But the  natural bounds of a melodic tonality as established by these northern  harpers have been very much exceeded in modern times, so that now  there is hardly a chord possible which might not be introduced in the  course of a composition in any key whatever, without effecting a  digression into the new key suggested by the strange chord. Not only  all the natural or diatonic notes are regarded as belonging to a key,  but also all the chromatics, the sharps and flats, and the double  sharps and double flats.    All this implies a growth of tonal perception on the part of the  hearers, and especially of the ability to co-ordinate tonal  impressions over a wide and constantly increasing range. For the  hearer has in mind not only the particular tone which at the moment  occupies his ear, and the others which preceded it, and a sort of  inner feeling of the tone which will follow the present one, but also  all the other tones over which the singer would pass in going from one  tone to another. And unless he has this he cannot realize the true  place of the melody tone in key, and therefore rests unconscious of  its real expression. It is, indeed, possible for him to make a mistake  in regard to the tones which he unconsciously associates with the  tones actually heard--as, for example, when one hears an E followed by  a C higher, and one thinks of the four white keys of the piano between  them, while the melody may be thinking of the black keys between them.  In the one case the melody would be in the key of C, in the other of C  sharp minor. And the expression of the melodic skip would be  enormously changed thereby. This larger education of the faculties of  tonal perception and tonal co-ordination has been the work mainly of  the last century and a half, and more particularly of the present  century itself. During this period the progress has been more rapid  than within any other in the entire course of the history of our art,  and it is to the successive steps preparing for this that we now  address ourselves.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VI.    THE MINSTRELS OF THE NORTH.      Upon many accounts the development of minstrelsy by the Celtic singers  and harpers was one of the most important of all the forces operative  in the transformation of the art from the monody of the ancients to  the expressive melody and rich harmony of modern music. As it is to a  considerable extent one side of the direct course of this history,  which hitherto has dealt largely with the south of Europe, the present  is the most convenient time for giving it the consideration its  importance deserves. I do this more readily because English influence  upon the development of music has generally been underrated by  continental writers, the erudite Fetis alone excepted; while their own  national writers, even, have not shown themselves generally conscious  of the splendid record which was made by their fathers.    The Celts appear upon the field of history several centuries before  the Christian era. Caesar's account of them leaves no doubt of the  place which music held in their religion, education and national life.  The minstrel was a prominent figure, ready at a moment's notice to  perform the service of religion, patriotism or entertainment. There is  a tradition of one King Blegywied ap Scifyllt, who reigned in  Brittany about 160 B.C., who was a good musician and a player upon the  harp. While we have no precise knowledge of the music they sang in the  oldest times, it was very likely something like the following old  Breton air, which is supposed to have come down from the Druids. It is  full of a rude energy, making it impressive even to modern ears. By  successive migrations of Angles, Danes and Northmen, the Celts were  crowded into Wales, where they still remain. The harp has always been  their principal instrument, and for many centuries a rude kind of  violin called the crwth, of which there will be occasion to speak in  connection with the violin, at a later period in this work.    [Music illustration: OLD BRETON SONG.

The first class was composed of the historians and  antiquaries, who piqued themselves a little upon their sorcery, and  who, upon occasion, took up the roles of diviners and prophets. The  second class was composed of domestic bards, living in private houses,  quite after the custom of ancient Greece. These we may suppose were  chiefly devoted to the annals and glories of their wealthy patrons.  The third class, the heraldic bards, was the most influential of all.  They wrote the national annals. All these classes were poet-bards as  well as musicians.    The musical bards were divided into three classes. In the first were  the players upon the harp; they were called doctors of music. To be  admitted into this class it was necessary that they should perform  successfully the three Mwchwl--that is, the three most difficult  pieces in the bardic repertory. The second class of musical bards was  composed of the players upon the crwth, of six strings. The third  class were the singers. From the wording of the requirement it would  seem that these must have had the same qualification as the first  class, and therefore have been true doctors of music. For, in addition  to being able to accord the harp or the crwth, and play different  themes with their variations, two preludes and other pieces \"with  their sharps and their flats,\" they had to know the \"three styles of  expression,\" and accent them with the voice in different styles of  song. They had also to know the twenty-four meters of poetry as well  as the \"twenty-four measures of music.\" Finally, they must be able to  compose songs in many of these meters, to read Welsh correctly, to  write exactly, and to correct an ancient poem corrupted by the  copyists.    The classification of new bards was made at an Eisteddfod once in  three years. It was a public contest, after the custom of the Greeks.  The degrees were three, conferred at intervals of three years  respectively. The organization of the bards existed until the  sixteenth century; it was suppressed under Queen Elizabeth. The  Eisteddfod has been maintained until the present time. The learned  musical historian, J.J. Fetis, attended one in 1829, of which he has  left an interesting account. The performances of the blind minstrel of  Caernarvon, Richard Robinson, excited his admiration beyond anything  else that he mentions. He says: \"His skill was something  extraordinary. The modern harp of Wales has no pedals for the  semitones in modulations. It is supplied with three ranks of strings,  of which the left and right give diatonic notes, those in the middle  the half-tones. Nothing more inconvenient could be imagined; in spite  of his blindness, this minstrel, in the most difficult passages,  seized the strings of the middle ranks with most marvelous address.  The innate skill of this musician of nature, the calm and goodness  painted upon his visage, rendered him an object of general interest.\"    Independently of the minstrels of this high class, they had also  wandering minstrels who played the crwth of three strings, and who  made themselves useful in the customary dances and songs of the  peasants and the common people.    There exists an old manuscript, supposed to have been begun in the  third or fourth century, _Y Trioeddy nys Prydain_ (\"The Triads of the  Isle of Britain\"). It contains the traditions from the ancient times  until the seventh century. Among the famous triads of this book are:  The three bards who bore the cloth of gold, Merlin Ambrosius, Merlin,  son of Morvryn, and Taleisin, chief of the bards. There were three  principles of song: Composition of poetry, execution upon the harp,  and erudition. In the sixth century we see the bards playing the harp  and singing their stirring songs with inspiring effect in animating  the hearts of their compatriots again in their successful combats  against the Saxons. Edward Jones, bard of the Prince of Wales in the  last part of the eighteenth century, preserved the names of  twenty-three bards who lived in the sixth century. The principal were  Taleisin pen Beirrd, Aneurin Gwawrydd, Gildas ab Caw, Gildas Badonius.  Taleisin was bard of Prince Elphin, then of King Maelgwin, and in the  last place of Prince Urien Reged. He lived about 550; a number of his  poems remain, but no fragment of his melody. Aneurin was author of  \"Gododn,\" one of the best Welsh poems that has come down to us.    In the British Museum there is a manuscript supposed to have been  begun in the eleventh century, containing much music for the harp.  Among it are exercises in the curious notation of the Welsh, in which  chords are freely used, and in positions suggesting the immediate  occasion of their introduction--that, namely of supplementing the  small power of the instrument by sounding several tones together,  which, as octaves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#13)"],[1,"underlined,       and then read consecutively, it will be seen that they give       a consistent and almost complete account of the Deluge: Gen.       vi. 9-22; vii. 6, 11, 13-16 (down to \"as God commanded       him\"), 17 (to \"upon the earth\"), 18-21, 24; viii. 1, 2 (to       \"were stopped\"), 3 (from \"and after\")-5, 13 (to \"from off       the earth\"), 14-19; and ix. 1-17. The marked passages       represent the \"later Hebrew Version.\" If the remaining       passages be then read consecutively, they will be seen to       give a different version of the same events, though not so       completely preserved as the other; these passages       substantially represent the \"earlier Hebrew Version\". In       commentaries on the Hebrew text they are, of course, usually       referred to under the convenient symbols J and P,       representing respectively the earlier and the later       versions. For further details, see any of the modern       commentaries on Genesis, e.g. Driver, _Book of Genesis_, pp.       85 ff.; Skinner, _Genesis_, pp. 147 ff.; Ryle, _Genesis_, p.       96 f.    Now the tablets from the Royal Library at Nineveh inscribed with the  Gilgamesh Epic do not date from an earlier period than the seventh  century B.C. But archaeological evidence has long shown that the  traditions themselves were current during all periods of Babylonian  history; for Gilgamesh and his half-human friend Enkidu were favourite  subjects for the seal-engraver, whether he lived in Sumerian times or  under the Achaemenian kings of Persia. We have also, for some years now,  possessed two early fragments of the Deluge narrative, proving that the  story was known to the Semitic inhabitants of the country at the time of  Hammurabi's dynasty.(1) Our newly discovered text from Nippur was  also written at about that period, probably before 2100 B.C. But the  composition itself, apart from the tablet on which it is inscribed, must  go back very much earlier than that. For instead of being composed  in Semitic Babylonian, the text is in Sumerian, the language of the  earliest known inhabitants of Babylonia, whom the Semites eventually  displaced. This people, it is now recognized, were the originators  of the Babylonian civilization, and we saw in the first lecture that,  according to their own traditions, they had occupied that country since  the dawn of history.         (1) The earlier of the two fragments is dated in the       eleventh year of Ammizaduga, the tenth king of Hammurabi's       dynasty, i.e. in 1967 B.C.; it was published by Scheil,       _Recueil de travaux_, Vol. XX, pp. 55 ff. Here the Deluge       story does not form part of the Gilgamesh Epic, but is       recounted in the second tablet of a different work; its hero       bears the name Atrakhasis, as in the variant version of the       Deluge from the Nineveh library. The other and smaller       fragment, which must be dated by its script, was published       by Hilprecht (_Babylonian Expedition_, series D, Vol. V,       Fasc. 1, pp. 33 ff.), who assigned it to about the same       period; but it is probably of a considerably later date. The       most convenient translations of the legends that were known       before the publication of the Nippur texts are those given       by Rogers, _Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament_       (Oxford, 1912), and Dhorme, _Choix de textes religieux       Assyro-Babyloniens_ (Paris, 1907).    The Semites as a ruling race came later, though the occurrence of  Semitic names in the Sumerian Dynastic List suggests very early  infiltration from Arabia. After a long struggle the immigrants succeeded  in dominating the settled race; and in the process they in turn became  civilized. They learnt and adopted the cuneiform writing, they took over  the Sumerian literature. Towards the close of the third millennium, when  our tablet was written, the Sumerians as a race had almost ceased  to exist. They had been absorbed in the Semitic population and their  language was no longer the general language of the country. But their  ancient literature and sacred texts were carefully preserved and  continued to be studied by the Semitic priests and scribes. So the fact  that the tablet is written in the old Sumerian tongue proves that the  story it tells had come down from a very much earlier period. This  inference is not affected by certain small differences in idiom  which its language presents when compared with that of Sumerian  building-inscriptions. Such would naturally occur in the course of  transmission, especially in a text which, as we shall see, had been  employed for a practical purpose after being subjected to a process of  reduction to suit it to its new setting.    When we turn to the text itself, it will be obvious that the story also  is very primitive. But before doing so we will inquire whether this  very early version is likely to cast any light on the origin of Deluge  stories such as are often met with in other parts of the world. Our  inquiry will have an interest apart from the question itself, as it  will illustrate the views of two divergent schools among students of  primitive literature and tradition. According to one of these views,  in its most extreme form, the tales which early or primitive man tells  about his gods and the origin of the world he sees around him are never  to be regarded as simple stories, but are to be consistently interpreted  as symbolizing natural phenomena. It is, of course, quite certain that,  both in Egypt and Babylonia, mythology in later periods received a  strong astrological colouring; and it is equally clear that some legends  derive their origin from nature myths. But the theory in the hands  of its more enthusiastic adherents goes further than that. For them  a complete absence of astrological colouring is no deterrent from an  astrological interpretation; and, where such colouring does occur, the  possibility of later embellishment is discounted, and it is treated  without further proof as the base on which the original story rests. One  such interpretation of the Deluge narrative in Babylonia, particularly  favoured by recent German writers, would regard it as reflecting the  passage of the Sun through a portion of the ecliptic. It is assumed  that the primitive Babylonians were aware that in the course of ages  the spring equinox must traverse the southern or watery region of the  zodiac. This, on their system, signified a submergence of the whole  universe in water, and the Deluge myth would symbolize the safe passage  of the vernal Sun-god through that part of the ecliptic. But we need not  spend time over that view, as its underlying conception is undoubtedly  quite a late development of Babylonian astrology.    More attractive is the simpler astrological theory that the voyage of  any Deluge hero in his boat or ark represents the daily journey of  the Sun-god across the heavenly ocean, a conception which is so often  represented in Egyptian sculpture and painting. It used to be assumed by  holders of the theory that this idea of the Sun as \"the god in the boat\"  was common among primitive races, and that that would account for the  widespread occurrence of Deluge-stories among scattered races of  the world. But this view has recently undergone some modification in  accordance with the general trend of other lines of research. In recent  years there has been an increased readiness among archaeologists  to recognize evidence of contact between the great civilizations of  antiquity. This has been particularly the case in the area of the  Eastern Mediterranean; but the possibility has also been mooted of  the early use of land-routes running from the Near East to Central and  Southern Asia. The discovery in Chinese Turkestan, to the east of the  Caspian, of a prehistoric culture resembling that of Elam has now been  followed by the finding of similar remains by Sir Aurel Stein in the  course of the journey from which he has lately returned.(1) They were  discovered in an old basin of the Helmand River in Persian Seistan,  where they had been laid bare by wind-erosion. But more interesting  still, and an incentive to further exploration in that region, is  another of his discoveries last year, also made near the Afghan border.  At two sites in the Helmand Delta, well above the level of inundation,  he came across fragments of pottery inscribed in early Aramaic  characters,(2) though, for obvious reasons, he has left them with  all his other collections in India. This unexpected find, by the  way, suggests for our problem possibilities of wide transmission in  comparatively early times.         (1) See his \"Expedition in Central Asia\", in _The       Geographical Journal_, Vol. XLVII (Jan.-June, 1916), pp. 358       ff.         (2) Op. cit., p. 363.    The synthetic tendency among archaeologists has been reflected in  anthropological research, which has begun to question the separate and  independent origin, not only of the more useful arts and crafts, but  also of many primitive customs and beliefs. It is suggested that too  much stress has been laid on environment; and, though it is readily  admitted that similar needs and experiences may in some cases have given  rise to similar expedients and explanations, it is urged that man is  an imitative animal and that inventive genius is far from common.(1)  Consequently the wide dispersion of many beliefs and practices, which  used generally to be explained as due to the similar and independent  working of the human mind under like conditions, is now often  provisionally registered as evidence of migratory movement or of  cultural drift. Much good work has recently been done in tabulating  the occurrence of many customs and beliefs, in order to ascertain their  lines of distribution. Workers are as yet in the collecting stage, and  it is hardly necessary to say that explanatory theories are still to  be regarded as purely"]]]
