Habits are formed because the tissues  of our brains are capable of being modified by use, and of so retaining  the effects of this modification that the same act is easier of  performance each succeeding time. This results in the old act being  repeated instead of a new one being selected, and hence the old act is  perpetuated.    Even dead and inert matter obeys the same principles in this regard as  does living matter. Says M. Leon Dumont: \"Everyone knows how a garment,  having been worn a certain time, clings to the shape of the body better  than when it was new; there has been a change in the tissue, and this  change is a new habit of cohesion; a lock works better after having been  used some time; at the outset more force was required to overcome  certain roughness in the mechanism. The overcoming of this resistance is  a phenomenon of habituation. It costs less trouble to fold a paper when  it has been folded already. This saving of trouble is due to the  essential nature of habit, which brings it about that, to reproduce the  effect, a less amount of the outward cause is required. The sounds of a  violin improve by use in the hands of an able artist, because the fibers  of the wood at last contract habits of vibration conformed to harmonic  relations. This is what gives such inestimable value to instruments that  have belonged to great masters. Water, in flowing, hollows out for  itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having  ceased to flow, it resumes when it flows again the path traced for  itself before. Just so, the impressions of outer objects fashion for  themselves in the nervous system more and more appropriate paths, and  these vital phenomena recur under similar excitements from without, when  they have been interrupted for a certain time.\"[2]    ALL LIVING TISSUE PLASTIC.--What is true of inanimate matter is doubly  true of living tissue. The tissues of the human body can be molded into  almost any form you choose if taken in time. A child may be placed on  his feet at too early an age, and the bones of his legs form the habit  of remaining bent. The Flathead Indian binds a board on the skull of his  child, and its head forms the habit of remaining flat on the top. Wrong  bodily postures produce curvature of the spine, and pernicious modes of  dress deform the bones of the chest. The muscles may be trained into the  habit of keeping the shoulders straight or letting them droop; those of  the back, to keep the body well up on the hips, or to let it sag; those  of locomotion, to give us a light, springy step, or to allow a shuffling  carriage; those of speech, to give us a clear-cut, accurate  articulation, or a careless, halting one; and those of the face, to give  us a cheerful cast of countenance, or a glum and morose expression.    HABIT A MODIFICATION OF BRAIN TISSUE.--But the nervous tissue is the  most sensitive and easily molded of all bodily tissues. In fact, it is  probable that the real _habit_ of our characteristic walk, gesture, or  speech resides in the brain, rather than in the muscles which it  controls. So delicate is the organization of the brain structure and so  unstable its molecules, that even the perfume of the flower, which  assails the nose of a child, the song of a bird, which strikes his ear,  or the fleeting dream, which lingers but for a second in his sleep, has  so modified his brain that it will never again be as if these things had  not been experienced. Every sensory current which runs in from the  outside world; every motor current which runs out to command a muscle;  every thought that we think, has so modified the nerve structure through  which it acts, that a tendency remains for a like act to be repeated.  Our brain and nervous system is daily being molded into fixed habits of  acting by our thoughts and deeds, and thus becomes the automatic  register of all we do.    The old Chinese fairy story hits upon a fundamental and vital truth.  These celestials tell their children that each child is accompanied by  day and by night, every moment of his life, by an invisible fairy, who  is provided with a pencil and tablet. It is the duty of this fairy to  put down every deed of the child, both good and evil, in an indelible  record which will one day rise as a witness against him. So it is in  very truth with our brains. The wrong act may have been performed in  secret, no living being may ever know that we performed it, and a  merciful Providence may forgive it; but the inexorable monitor of our  deeds was all the time beside us writing the record, and the history of  that act is inscribed forever in the tissues of our brain. It may be  repented of bitterly in sackcloth and ashes and be discontinued, but its  effects can never be quite effaced; they will remain with us a handicap  till our dying day, and in some critical moment in a great emergency we  shall be in danger of defeat from that long past and forgotten act.    WE MUST FORM HABITS.--We _must_, then, form habits. It is not at all in  our power to say whether we will form habits or not; for, once started,  they go on forming themselves by day and night, steadily and  relentlessly. Habit is, therefore, one of the great factors to be  reckoned with in our lives, and the question becomes not, Shall we form  habits? but _What habits we shall form._ And we have the determining of  this question largely in our own power, for habits do not just happen,  nor do they come to us ready made. We ourselves make them from day to  day through the acts we perform, and in so far as we have control over  our acts, in that far we can determine our habits.      2. THE PLACE OF HABIT IN THE ECONOMY OF OUR LIVES    Habit is one of nature's methods of economizing time and effort, while  at the same time securing greater skill and efficiency. This is easily  seen when it is remembered that habit tends towards _automatic_ action;  that is, towards action governed by the lower nerve centers and taking  care of itself, so to speak, without the interference of consciousness.  Everyone has observed how much easier in the performance and more  skillful in its execution is the act, be it playing a piano, painting a  picture, or driving a nail, when the movements involved have ceased to  be consciously directed and become automatic.    HABIT INCREASES SKILL AND EFFICIENCY.--Practically all increase in  skill, whether physical or mental, depends on our ability to form  habits. Habit holds fast to the skill already attained while practice or  intelligence makes ready for the next step in advance. Could we not form  habits we should improve but little in our way of doing things, no  matter how many times we did them over. We should now be obliged to go  through the same bungling process of dressing ourselves as when we  first learned it as children. Our writing would proceed as awkwardly in  the high school as the primary, our eating as adults would be as messy  and wide of the mark as when we were infants, and we should miss in a  thousand ways the motor skill that now seems so easy and natural. All  highly skilled occupations, and those demanding great manual dexterity,  likewise depend on our habit-forming power for the accurate and  automatic movements required.    So with mental skill. A great portion of the fundamentals of our  education must be made automatic--must become matters of habit. We set  out to learn the symbols of speech. We hear words and see them on the  printed page; associated with these words are meanings, or ideas. Habit  binds the word and the idea together, so that to think of the one is to  call up the other--and language is learned. We must learn numbers, so we  practice the \"combinations,\" and with 4x6, or 3x8 we associate 24. Habit  secures this association in our minds, and lo! we soon know our  \"tables.\" And so on throughout the whole range of our learning. We learn  certain symbols, or facts, or processes, and habit takes hold and  renders these automatic so that we can use them freely, easily, and with  skill, leaving our thought free for matters that cannot be made  automatic. One of our greatest dangers is that we shall not make  sufficiently automatic, enough of the necessary foundation material of  education. Failing in this, we shall at best be but blunderers  intellectually, handicapped because we failed to make proper use of  habit in our development.    For, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, there is a limit to our  mental energy and also to the number of objects to which we are able to  attend. It is only when attention has been freed from the many things  that can always be thought or done _in the same way_, that the mind can  devote itself to the real problems that require judgment, imagination or  reasoning. The writer whose spelling and punctuation do not take care of  themselves will hardly make a success of writing. The mathematician  whose number combinations, processes and formulae are not automatic in  his mind can never hope to make progress in mathematical thinking. The  speaker who, while speaking, has to think of his gestures, his voice or  his enunciation will never sway audiences by his logic or his eloquence.    HABIT SAVES EFFORT AND FATIGUE.--We do most easily and with least  fatigue that which we are accustomed to do. It is the new act or the  strange task that tires us. The horse that is used to the farm wearies  if put on the road, while the roadster tires easily when hitched to the  plow. The experienced penman works all day at his desk without undue  fatigue, while the man more accustomed to the pick and the shovel than  to the pen, is exhausted by a half hour's writing at a letter. Those who  follow a sedentary and inactive occupation do not tire by much sitting,  while children or others used to freedom and action may find it a  wearisome "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#13)"],[1," should be more than a foot and a half thick. The other walls are built  of the same thickness in order to save space. Now brick walls, unless  two or three bricks thick, cannot support more than one story; certainly  not if they are only a foot and a half in thickness. But with the  present importance of the city and the unlimited numbers of its  population, it is necessary to increase the number of dwelling-places  indefinitely. Consequently, as the ground floors could not admit of so  great a number living in the city, the nature of the case has made it  necessary to find relief by making the buildings high. In these tall  piles reared with piers of stone, walls of burnt brick, and partitions  of rubble work, and provided with floor after floor, the upper stories  can be partitioned off into rooms to very great advantage. The  accommodations within the city walls being thus multiplied as a result  of the many floors high in the air, the Roman people easily find  excellent places in which to live.    18. It has now been explained how limitations of building space  necessarily forbid the employment of brick walls within the city. When  it becomes necessary to use them outside the city, they should be  constructed as follows in order to be perfect and durable. On the top of  the wall lay a structure of burnt brick, about a foot and a half in  height, under the tiles and projecting like a coping. Thus the defects  usual in these walls can be avoided. For when the tiles on the roof are  broken or thrown down by the wind so that rainwater can leak through,  this burnt brick coating will prevent the crude brick from being  damaged, and the cornice-like projection will throw off the drops beyond  the vertical face, and thus the walls, though of crude brick structure,  will be preserved intact.    19. With regard to burnt brick, nobody can tell offhand whether it is of  the best or unfit to use in a wall, because its strength can be tested  only after it has been used on a roof and exposed to bad weather and  time--then, if it is good it is accepted. If not made of good clay or if  not baked sufficiently, it shows itself defective there when exposed to  frosts and rime. Brick that will not stand exposure on roofs can never  be strong enough to carry its load in a wall. Hence the strongest burnt  brick walls are those which are constructed out of old roofing tiles.    20. As for \"wattle and daub\" I could wish that it had never been  invented. The more it saves in time and gains in space, the greater and  the more general is the disaster that it may cause; for it is made to  catch fire, like torches. It seems better, therefore, to spend on walls  of burnt brick, and be at expense, than to save with \"wattle and daub,\"  and be in danger. And, in the stucco covering, too, it makes cracks from  the inside by the arrangement of its studs and girts. For these swell  with moisture as they are daubed, and then contract as they dry, and, by  their shrinking, cause the solid stucco to split. But since some are  obliged to use it either to save time or money, or for partitions on an  unsupported span, the proper method of construction is as follows. Give  it a high foundation so that it may nowhere come in contact with the  broken stone-work composing the floor; for if it is sunk in this, it  rots in course of time, then settles and sags forward, and so breaks  through the surface of the stucco covering.    I have now explained to the best of my ability the subject of walls, and  the preparation of the different kinds of material employed, with their  advantages and disadvantages. Next, following the guidance of Nature, I  shall treat of the framework and the kinds of wood used in it, showing  how they may be procured of a sort that will not give way as time goes  on.          CHAPTER IX    TIMBER      1. Timber should be felled between early Autumn and the time when  Favonius begins to blow. For in Spring all trees become pregnant, and  they are all employing their natural vigour in the production of leaves  and of the fruits that return every year. The requirements of that  season render them empty and swollen, and so they are weak and feeble  because of their looseness of texture. This is also the case with women  who have conceived. Their bodies are not considered perfectly healthy  until the child is born; hence, pregnant slaves, when offered for sale,  are not warranted sound, because the fetus as it grows within the body  takes to itself as nourishment all the best qualities of the mother's  food, and so the stronger it becomes as the full time for birth  approaches, the less compact it allows that body to be from which it is  produced. After the birth of the child, what was heretofore taken to  promote the growth of another creature is now set free by the delivery  of the newborn, and the channels being now empty and open, the body will  take it in by lapping up its juices, and thus becomes compact and  returns to the natural strength which it had before.    2. On the same principle, with the ripening of the fruits in Autumn the  leaves begin to wither and the trees, taking up their sap from the earth  through the roots, recover themselves and are restored to their former  solid texture. But the strong air of winter compresses and solidifies  them during the time above mentioned. Consequently, if the timber is  felled on the principle and at the time above mentioned, it will be  felled at the proper season.    3. In felling a tree we should cut into the trunk of it to the very  heart, and then leave it standing so that the sap may drain out drop by  drop throughout the whole of it. In this way the useless liquid which is  within will run out through the sapwood instead of having to die in a  mass of decay, thus spoiling the quality of the timber. Then and not  till then, the tree being drained dry and the sap no longer dripping,  let it be felled and it will be in the highest state of usefulness.    4. That this is so may be seen in the case of fruit trees. When these  are tapped at the base and pruned, each at the proper time, they pour  out from the heart through the tapholes all the superfluous and  corrupting fluid which they contain, and thus the draining process makes  them durable. But when the juices of trees have no means of escape, they  clot and rot in them, making the trees hollow and good for nothing.  Therefore, if the draining process does not exhaust them while they are  still alive, there is no doubt that, if the same principle is followed  in felling them for timber, they will last a long time and be very  useful in buildings.    5. Trees vary and are unlike one another in their qualities. Thus it is  with the oak, elm, poplar, cypress, fir, and the others which are most  suitable to use in buildings. The oak, for instance, has not the  efficacy of the fir, nor the cypress that of the elm. Nor in the case of  other trees, is it natural that they should be alike; but the individual  kinds are effective in building, some in one way, some in another, owing  to the different properties of their elements.    6. To begin with fir: it contains a great deal of air and fire with very  little moisture and the earthy, so that, as its natural properties are  of the lighter class, it is not heavy. Hence, its consistence being  naturally stiff, it does not easily bend under the load, and keeps its  straightness when used in the framework. But it contains so much heat  that it generates and encourages decay, which spoils it; and it also  kindles fire quickly because of the air in its body, which is so open  that it takes in fire and so gives out a great flame.    7. The part which is nearest to the earth before the tree is cut down  takes up moisture through the roots from the immediate neighbourhood and  hence is without knots and is \"clear.\" But the upper part, on account of  the great heat in it, throws up branches into the air through the knots;  and this, when it is cut off about twenty feet from the ground and then  hewn, is called \"knotwood\" because of its hardness and knottiness. The  lowest part, after the tree is cut down and the sapwood of the same  thrown away, is split up into four pieces and prepared for joiner's  work, and so is called \"clearstock.\"    8. Oak, on the other hand, having enough and to spare of the earthy  among its elements, and containing but little moisture, air, and fire,  lasts for an unlimited period when buried in underground structures. It  follows that when exposed to moisture, as its texture is not loose and  porous, it cannot take in liquid on account of its compactness, but,  withdrawing from the moisture, it resists it and warps, thus making  cracks in the structures in which it is used.    9. The winter oak, being composed of a moderate amount of all the  elements, is very useful in buildings, but when in a moist place, it  takes in water to its centre through its pores, its air and fire being  expelled by the influence of the moisture, and so it rots. The Turkey  oak and the beech, both containing a mixture of moisture, fire, and the  earthy, with a great deal of air, through this loose texture take in  moisture to their centre and soon decay. White and black poplar, as well  as willow, linden, and the agnus castus, containing an abundance of  fire and air, a moderate amount of moisture, and only a small amount of  the earthy, are composed of a mixture which is proportionately rather  light, and so they are of great service from their stiffness. Although  on account of the mixture of the earthy in them they are not hard, yet  their loose texture makes them gleaming white, and they are a convenient  material to use in carving.    10. The alder, which is produced close by river banks, and which seems  to be altogether useless as building material, has really excellent  qualities. It is composed of a very large proportion of air and fire,  not much of the earthy, and only a"]]]
