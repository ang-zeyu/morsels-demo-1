Then he looked it over carefully before, with a  sigh of contentment, he sat down to put it in his empty little stomach.  When he had finished it to the last sweet, juicy kernel, he ambled  sleepily up the Lone Little Path to the big hollow chestnut tree where  he lives, and in its great hollow in a soft bed of leaves Bobby Coon  curled himself up in a tight little ball to sleep the long, bright day  away.    One of the Merry Little Breezes softly followed him.  When he had  crawled into the hollow chestnut and only his funny, ringed tail hung  out, the Merry Little Breezes tweaked it sharply just for fun, and then  danced away down the Lone Little Path to join the other Merry Little  Breezes around the Smiling Pool.    \"Oh!  Grandfather Frog,\" cried a Merry Little Breeze, \"tell us why it  is that Bobby Coon always washes his food.  He never eats it where he  gets it or takes it home to his hollow in the big chestnut, but always  comes to the Laughing Brook to wash it.  None of the other meadow  people do that.\"    Now Great-Grandfather Frog is counted very wise.  He is very, very old  and he knows the history of all the tribes of little meadow people way  back to the time when the frogs ruled the world.    When the Merry Little Breeze asked him why Bobby Coon always washes his  food, Grandfather Frog stopped to snap up a particularly fat, foolish,  green fly that came his way.  Then, while all the Merry Little Breezes  gathered around him, he settled himself on his big green lily pad and  began:    \"Once upon a time, when the world was young, old King Bear ruled in the  Green Forest.  Of course old Mother Nature, who was even more beautiful  then than she is now, was the real ruler, but she let old King Bear  think he ruled so long as he ruled wisely.    \"All the little Green Forest folk and all the little people of the  Green Meadows used to take presents of food to old King Bear, so that  he never had to hunt for things to eat.  He grew fatter and fatter and  fatter until it seemed as if his skin must burst.  And the fatter he  grew the lazier he grew.\"    Grandfather Frog paused with an expectant far-away look in his great  bulging eyes.  Then he leaped into the air so far that when he came  down it was with a great splash in the Smiling Pool.  But as he swam  back to his big lily pad the leg of a foolish green fly could be seen  sticking out of one corner of his big mouth, and he settled himself  with a sigh of great contentment.    \"Old King Bear,\" continued Grandfather Frog, just as if there had been  no interruption, \"grew fatter and lazier every day, and like a great  many other fat and lazy people who have nothing to do for themselves  but are always waited on by others, he grew shorter and shorter in  temper and harder and harder to please.    \"Now perhaps you don't know it, but the Bear family and the Coon family  are very closely related.  In fact, they are second cousins.  Old Mr.  Coon, Bobby Coon's father with a thousand greats tacked on before, was  young then, and he was very, very proud of being related to old King  Bear.  He began to pass some of his old playfellows on the Green  Meadows without seeing them.  He spent a great deal of time brushing  his coat and combing his whiskers and caring for his big ringed tail.  He held his head very high and he put on such airs that pretty soon he  could see no one at all but members of his own family and of the royal  family of Bear.    \"Now as old King Bear grew fat and lazy he grew fussy, so that he was  no longer content to take everything brought him, but picked out the  choicest portions for himself and left the rest.  Mr. Coon took charge  of all the things brought as tribute to old King Bear and of course  where there were so many goodies left he got all he wanted without  working.    \"So just as old King Bear had grown fat and lazy and selfish, Mr. Coon  grew fat and lazy and selfish.  Pretty soon he began to pick out the  best things for himself and hide them before old King Bear saw them.  When old King Bear was asleep he would go get them and stuff himself  like a greedy pig.  And because he was stealing and wanted no one to  see him he always ate his stolen feasts at night.    \"Now old Mother Nature is, as you all know, very, very wise, oh very  wise indeed.  One of the first laws she made when the world was young  is that every living thing shall work for what it has, and the harder  it works the stronger it shall grow.  So when Old Mother Nature saw how  fat and lazy and selfish old King Bear was getting and how fat and lazy  and dishonest his cousin, Mr. Coon, was becoming, she determined that  they should be taught a lesson which they would remember for ever and  ever and ever.    \"First she proclaimed that old King Bear should be king no longer, and  no more need the little folks of the Green Forest and the little people  of the Green Meadows bring him tribute.    \"Now when old Mother Nature made this proclamation old King Bear was  fast asleep.  It was just on the edge of winter and he had picked out a  nice warm cave with a great pile of leaves for a bed.  Old Mother  Nature peeped in at him.  He was snoring and probably dreaming of more  good things to eat.  'If he is to be king no longer, there is no use in  waking him now,' said old Mother Nature to herself, 'he is so fat and  so stupid.  He shall sleep until gentle Sister South Wind comes in the  spring to kiss away the snow and ice.  Then he shall waken with a lean  stomach and a great appetite and there shall be none to feed him.'    \"Now old Mother Nature always has a warm heart and she was very fond of  Bobby Coon's grandfather a thousand times removed.  So when she saw  what a selfish glutton and thief he had become she decided to put him  to sleep just as she had old King Bear.  But first she would teach Mr.  Coon that stolen food is not the sweetest.    \"So old Mother Nature found some tender, juicy corn just in the milk  which Mr. Coon had stolen from old King Bear.  Then she went down on  the Green Meadows where the wild mustard grows and gathering a lot of  this she rubbed the juice into the corn and then put it back where Mr.  Coon had left it.    \"Now I have told you that it was night when Mr. Coon had his stolen  feasts, for he wanted no one to see him.  So no one was there when he  took a great bite of the tender, juicy corn old Mother Nature had put  back for him.  Being greedy and a glutton, he swallowed the first  mouthful before he had fairly tasted it, and took a second, and then  such a time as there was on the edge of the Green Forest!  Mr. Coon  rolled over and over with both of his forepaws clasped over his stomach  and groaned and groaned and groaned.  He had rubbed his eyes and of  course had got mustard into them and could not see.  He waked up all  the little Green Forest folk who sleep through the night, as good  people should, and they all gathered around to see what was the matter  with Mr. Coon.    \"Finally old Mother Nature came to his relief and brought him some  water.  Then she led him to his home in the great hollow in the big  chestnut tree, and when she had seen him curled up in a tight little  ball among the dried leaves she put him into the long sleep as she had  old King Bear.    \"In the spring, when gentle Sister South Wind kissed away all the snow  and ice, old King Bear, who was king no longer, and Mr. Coon awoke and  both were very thin, and both were very hungry, oh very, very hungry  indeed.  Old King Bear, who was king no longer, wasn't the least mite  fussy about what he had to eat, but ate gladly any food he could find.    \"But Mr. Coon remembered the burning of his stomach and mouth and could  not forget it.  So whenever he found anything to eat he first took it  to the Laughing Brook or the Smiling Pool and washed it very carefully,  lest there be some mustard on it.    \"And ever since that long ago time, when the world was young, the Coon  family has remembered that experience of Mr. Coon, who was second  cousin to old King Bear, and that is why Bobby Coon washes his food,  travels about at night, and sleeps all winter,\" concluded Grandfather  Frog, fixing his great goggle eyes on a foolish green fly headed his  way.    \"Oh thank you, thank you, Grandfather Frog,\" cried the Merry Little  Breezes as they danced away over the Green Meadows.  But one of them  slipped back long enough to get behind the foolish green fly and blow  him right up to Grandfather Frog's big lily pad.    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog, smacking his lips.          XIII    THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES HAVE A BUSY DAY    Old Mother West Wind came down from the Purple Hills in the shadowy  coolness of the early morning, before even jolly, round, red Mr. Sun  had thrown off his rosy coverlids for his daily climb up through the  blue sky.  The last little star was blinking sleepily as Old Mother  West Wind turned her big bag upside down on the Green Meadows and all  her children, the Merry Little Breezes, tumbled out on the soft green  grass.    Then Old Mother West Wind kissed them all around and hurried away to  hunt for a rain cloud which had gone astray.  The Merry Little Breezes  watched her go.  Then they played hide and seek until jolly, round, red  Mr. Sun had climbed out of bed and was smiling down on the Green  Meadows.    Pretty soon along came Peter Rabbit, lipperty-lipperty-lip.    \"Hello, Peter Rabbit!\" shouted the Merry Little Breezes.  \"Come play  with us!\"    \"Can't,\" said Peter Rabbit.  \"I have to go find some tender young  carrots for my breakfast,\" and away be hurried, lipperty-lipperty-lip.    In a few minutes Jimmy Skunk came in sight and he seemed to be almost  hurrying along the Crooked Little Path down the hill.  The Merry Little  Breezes danced over to meet him.    \"Hello, Jimmy Skunk!\" they cried.  \"Come play with us!\"    Jimmy Skunk shook his head.  \"Can't,\" said he.  \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#13)"],[1,"mother was torn between the two  factions. For while she sympathized with her parents, and felt  personally cheated by my father's lack of piety, she thought it was  her duty to take her husband's part, even against her parents, in  their own house. My mother was one of those women who always obey the  highest law they know, even though it leads them to their doom.    How did it happen that my father, who from his early boyhood had been  pointed out as a scholar in embryo, failed to live up to the  expectations of his world? It happened as it happened that his hair  curled over his high forehead: he was made that way. If people were  disappointed, it was because they had based their expectations on a  misconception of his character, for my father had never had any  aspirations for extreme piety. Piety was imputed to him by his mother,  by his rebbe, by his neighbors, when they saw that he rendered the  sacred word more intelligently than his fellow students. It was not  his fault that his people confused scholarship with religious ardor.  Having a good mind, he was glad to exercise it; and being given only  one subject to study he was bound to make rapid progress in that. If  he had ever been offered a choice between a religious and a secular  education, his friends would have found out early that he was not born  to be a rav. But as he had no mental opening except through the  hedder, he went on from year to year winning new distinction in Hebrew  scholarship; with the result that witnesses with preconceived ideas  began to see the halo of piety playing around his head, and a  well-to-do family was misled into making a match with him for the sake  of the glory that he was to attain.    When it became evident that the son-in-law was not going to develop  into a rav, my grandfather notified him that he would have to assume  the support of his own family without delay. My father therefore  entered on a series of experiments with paying occupations, for none  of which he was qualified, and in none of which he succeeded  permanently.    My mother was with my father, as equal partner and laborer, in  everything he attempted in Polotzk. They tried keeping a wayside inn,  but had to give it up because the life was too rough for my mother,  who was expecting her first baby. Returning to Polotzk they went to  storekeeping on their own account, but failed in this also, because my  father was inexperienced, and my mother, now with the baby to nurse,  was not able to give her best attention to business. Over two years  passed in this experiment, and in the interval the second child was  born, increasing my parents' need of a home and a reliable income.    It was then decided that my father should seek his fortune elsewhere.  He travelled as far east as Tchistopol, on the Volga, and south as far  as Odessa, on the Black Sea, trying his luck at various occupations  within the usual Jewish restrictions. Finally he reached the position  of assistant superintendent in a distillery, with a salary of thirty  rubles a month. That was a fair income for those days, and he was  planning to have his family join him when my Grandfather Raphael died,  leaving my mother heir to a good business. My father thereupon  returned to Polotzk, after nearly three years' absence from home.    As my mother had been trained to her business from childhood, while my  father had had only a little irregular experience, she naturally  remained the leader. She was as successful as her father before her.  The people continued to call her Raphael's Hannah Hayye, and under  that name she was greatly respected in the business world. Her eldest  brother was now a merchant of importance, and my mother's  establishment was gradually enlarged; so that, altogether, our family  had a solid position in Polotzk, and there were plenty to envy us.    We were almost rich, as Polotzk counted riches in those days;  certainly we were considered well-to-do. We moved into a larger house,  where there was room for out-of-town customers to stay overnight, with  stabling for their horses. We lived as well as any people of our  class, and perhaps better, because my father had brought home with  him from his travels a taste for a more genial life than Polotzk  usually asked for. My mother kept a cook and a nursemaid, and a  dvornik, or outdoor man, to take care of the horses, the cow, and the  woodpile. All the year round we kept open house, as I remember.  Cousins and aunts were always about, and on holidays friends of all  degrees gathered in numbers. And coming and going in the wing set  apart for business guests were merchants, traders, country peddlers,  peasants, soldiers, and minor government officials. It was a full  house at all times, and especially so during fairs, and at the season  of the military draft.    In the family wing there was also enough going on. There were four of  us children, besides father and mother and grandmother, and the  parasitic cousins. Fetchke was the eldest; I was the second; the third  was my only brother, named Joseph, for my father's father; and the  fourth was Deborah, named for my mother's mother.    I suppose I ought to explain my own name also, especially because I am  going to emerge as the heroine by and by. Be it therefore known that I  was named Maryashe, for a bygone aunt. I was never called by my full  name, however. \"Maryashe\" was too dignified for me. I was always  \"Mashinke,\" or else \"Mashke,\" by way of diminutive. A variety of  nicknames, mostly suggested by my physical peculiarities, were  bestowed on me from time to time by my fond or foolish relatives. My  uncle Berl, for example, gave me the name of \"Zukrochene Flum,\" which  I am not going to translate, because it is uncomplimentary.    My sister Fetchke was always the good little girl, and when our  troubles began she was an important member of the family. What sort of  little girl I was will be written by and by. Joseph was the best  Jewish boy that ever was born, but he hated to go to heder, so he had  to be whipped, of course. Deborah was just a baby, and her principal  characteristic was single-mindedness. If she had teething to attend  to, she thought of nothing else day or night, and communicated with  the family on no other subject. If it was whooping-cough, she whooped  most heartily; if it was measles, she had them thick.    It was the normal thing in Polotzk, where the mothers worked as well  as the fathers, for the children to be left in the hands of  grandmothers and nursemaids. I suffer reminiscent terrors when I  recall Deborah's nurse, who never opened her lips except to frighten  us children--or else to lie. That girl never told the truth if she  could help it. I know it is so because I heard her tell eleven or  twelve unnecessary lies every day. In the beginning of her residence  with us, I exposed her indignantly every time I caught her lying; but  the tenor of her private conversations with me was conducive to a  cessation of my activity along the line of volunteer testimony. In  shorter words, the nurse terrified me with horrid threats until I did  not dare to contradict her even if she lied her head off. The things  she promised me in this life and in the life to come could not be  executed by a person without imagination. The nurse gave almost her  entire attention to us older children, disposing easily of the baby's  claims. Deborah, unless she was teething or whoop-coughing, was a  quiet baby, and would lie for hours on the nurse's lap, sucking at a  \"pacifier\" made of bread and sugar tied up in a muslin rag, and  previously chewed to a pulp by the nurse. And while the baby sucked  the nurse told us things--things that we must remember when we went to  bed at night.    A favorite subject of her discourse was the Evil One, who lived, so  she told us, in our attic, with his wife and brood. A pet amusement of  our invisible tenant was the translating of human babies into his  lair, leaving one of his own brats in the cradle; the moral of which  was that if nurse wanted to loaf in the yard and watch who went out  and who came in, we children must mind the baby. The girl was so sly  that she carried on all this tyranny without being detected, and we  lived in terror till she was discharged for stealing.    In our grandmothers we were very fortunate: They spoiled us to our  hearts' content. Grandma Deborah's methods I know only from hearsay,  for I was very little when she died. Grandma Rachel I remember  distinctly, spare and trim and always busy. I recall her coming in  midwinter from the frozen village where she lived. I remember, as if  it were but last winter, the immense shawls and wraps which we unwound  from about her person, her voluminous brown sack coat in which there  was room for three of us at a time, and at last the tight clasp of her  long arms, and her fresh, cold cheeks on ours. And when the hugging  and kissing were over, Grandma had a treat for us. It was _talakno_,  or oat flour, which we mixed with cold water and ate raw, using wooden  spoons, just like the peasants, and smacking our lips over it in  imaginary enjoyment.    But Grandma Rachel did not come to play. She applied herself  energetically to the housekeeping. She kept her bright eye on  everything, as if she were in her own trifling establishment in  Yuchovitch. Watchful was she as any cat--and harmless as a tame  rabbit. If she caught the maids at fault, she found an excuse for  them at the same time. If she was quite exasperated with the stupidity  of Yakub, the dvornik, she pretended to curse him in a phrase of her  own invention, a mixture of Hebrew and Russian, which, translated,  said, \"Mayst thou have gold and silver in thy bosom\"; but to the  choreman, who was not a linguist, the mongrel phrase conveyed a sense  of his delinquency.    Grandma Rachel meant to be very strict with us children, and  accordingly was prompt to discipline us; but we discovered early "]]]
