Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      I'll go back to the Western land,    I'll hunt up my old cowboy band,--    Where the girls are few and the boys are true    And a false-hearted love I never knew.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      \"O Buddie, O Buddie, please stay at home,    Don't be forever on the roam.

THE HORSE WRANGLER        I thought one spring just for fun    I'd see how cow-punching was done,    And when the round-ups had begun    I tackled the cattle-king.    Says he, \"My foreman is in town,    He's at the plaza, and his name is Brown,    If you'll see him, he'll take you down.\"    Says I, \"That's just the thing.\"      We started for the ranch next day;    Brown augured me most all the way.    He said that cow-punching was nothing but play,    That it was no work at all,--    That all you had to do was ride,    And only drifting with the tide;    The son of a gun, oh, how he lied.    Don't you think he had his gall?      He put me in charge of a cavyard,    And told me not to work too hard,    That all I had to do was guard    The horses from getting away;    I had one hundred and sixty head,    I sometimes wished that I was dead;    When one got away, Brown's head turned red,    And there was the devil to pay.      Sometimes one would make a break,    Across the prairie he would take,    As if running for a stake,--    It seemed to them but play;    Sometimes I could not head them at all,    Sometimes my horse would catch a fall    And I'd shoot on like a cannon ball    Till the earth came in my way.      They saddled me up an old gray hack    With two set-fasts on his back,    They padded him down with a gunny sack    And used my bedding all.    When I got on he quit the ground,    Went up in the air and turned around,    And I came down and busted the ground,--    I got one hell of a fall.      They took me up and carried me in    And rubbed me down with an old stake pin.    \"That's the way they all begin;    You're doing well,\" says Brown.    \"And in the morning, if you don't die,    I'll give you another horse to try.\"    \"Oh say, can't I walk?\" says I.    Says he, \"Yes, back to town.\"      I've traveled up and I've traveled down,    I've traveled this country round and round,    I've lived in city and I've lived in town,    But I've got this much to say:    Before you try cow-punching, kiss your wife,    Take a heavy insurance on your life,    Then cut your throat with a barlow knife,--    For it's easier done that way.          CALIFORNIA JOE        Well, mates, I don't like stories;    Or am I going to act    A part around the campfire    That ain't a truthful fact?    So fill your pipes and listen,    I'll tell you--let me see--    I think it was in fifty,    From that till sixty-three.      You've all heard tell of Bridger;    I used to run with Jim,    And many a hard day's scouting    I've done longside of him.    Well, once near old Fort Reno,    A trapper used to dwell;    We called him old Pap Reynolds,    The scouts all knew him well.      One night in the spring of fifty    We camped on Powder River,    And killed a calf of buffalo    And cooked a slice of liver.    While eating, quite contented,    I heard three shots or four;    Put out the fire and listened,--    We heard a dozen more.      We knew that old man Reynolds    Had moved his traps up here;    So picking up our rifles    And fixing on our gear    We moved as quick as lightning,    To save was our desire.    Too late, the painted heathens    Had set the house on fire.      We hitched our horses quickly    And waded up the stream;    While down close beside the waters    I heard a muffled scream.    And there among the bushes    A little girl did lie.    I picked her up and whispered,    \"I'll save you or I'll die.\"      Lord, what a ride! Old Bridger    Had covered my retreat;    Sometimes that child would whisper    In voice low and sweet,    \"Poor Papa, God will take him    To Mama up above;    There is no one left to love me,    There is no one left to love.\"      The little one was thirteen    And I was twenty-two;    I says, \"I'll be your father    And love you just as true.\"    She nestled to my bosom,    Her hazel eyes so bright,    Looked up and made me happy,--    The close pursuit that night.      One month had passed and Maggie,    We called her Hazel Eye,    In truth was going to leave me,    Was going to say good-bye.    Her uncle, Mad Jack Reynolds,    Reported long since dead,    Had come to claim my angel,    His brother's child, he said.      What could I say? We parted,    Mad Jack was growing old;    I handed him a bank note    And all I had in gold.    They rode away at sunrise,    I went a mile or two,    And parting says, \"We will meet again;    May God watch over you.\"      By a laughing, dancing brook    A little cabin stood,    And weary with a long day's scout,    I spied it in the wood.    The pretty valley stretched beyond,    The mountains towered above,    And near its willow banks I heard    The cooing of a dove.      'Twas one grand pleasure;    The brook was plainly seen,    Like a long thread of silver    In a cloth of lovely green;    The laughter of the water,    The cooing of the dove,    Was like some painted picture,    Some well-told tale of love.      While drinking in the country    And resting in the saddle,    I heard a gentle rippling    Like the dipping of a paddle,    And turning to the water,    A strange sight met my view,--    A lady with her rifle    In a little bark canoe.      She stood up in the center,    With her rifle to her eye;    I thought just for a second    My time had come to die.    I doffed my hat and told her,    If it was just the same,    To drop her little shooter,    For I was not her game.      She dropped the deadly weapon    And leaped from the canoe.    Says she, \"I beg your pardon;    I thought you was a Sioux.    Your long hair and your buckskin    Looked warrior-like and rough;    My bead was spoiled by sunshine,    Or I'd have killed you sure enough.\"      \"Perhaps it would've been better    If you'd dropped me then,\" says I;    \"For surely such an angel    Would bear me to the sky.\"    She blushingly dropped her eyelids,    Her cheeks were crimson red;    One half-shy glance she gave me    And then hung down her head.      I took her little hand in mine;    She wondered what it meant,    And yet she drew it not away,    But rather seemed content.    We sat upon the mossy bank,    Her eyes began to fill;    The brook was rippling at our feet,    The dove was cooing still.      'Tis strong arms were thrown around her.    \"I'll save you or I'll die.\"    I clasped her to my bosom,    My long lost Hazel Eye.    The rapture of that moment    Was almost heaven to me;    I kissed her 'mid the tear-drops,    Her merriment and glee.      Her heart near mine was beating    When sobbingly she said,    \"My dear, my brave preserver,    They told me you were dead.    But oh, those parting words, Joe,    Have never left my mind,    You said, 'We'll meet again, Mag,'    Then rode off like the wind.      \"And oh, how I have prayed, Joe,    For you who saved my life,    That God would send an angel    To guide you through all strife.    The one who claimed me from you,    My Uncle, good and true,    Is sick in yonder cabin;    Has talked so much of you.      \"'If Joe were living darling,'    He said to me last night,    'He would care for you, Maggie,    When God puts out my light.'\"    We found the old man sleeping.    \"Hush, Maggie, let him rest.\"    The sun was slowly setting    In the far-off, glowing West.      And though we talked in whispers    He opened wide his eyes:    \"A dream, a dream,\" he murmured;    \"Alas, a dream of lies.\"    She drifted like a shadow    To where the old man lay.    \"You had a dream, dear Uncle,    Another dream to-day?\"      \"Oh yes, I saw an angel    As pure as mountain snow,    And near her at my bedside    Stood California Joe.\"    \"I'm sure I'm not an angel,    Dear Uncle, that you know;    These hands that hold your hand, too,    My face is not like snow.      \"Now listen while I tell you,    For I have news to cheer;    Hazel Eye is happy,    For Joe is truly here.\"    It was but a few days after    The old man said to me,    \"Joe, boy, she is an angel,    And good as angels be.      \"For three long months she hunted,    And trapped and nursed me too;    God bless you, boy, I believe it,    She's safe along with you.\"    The sun was slowly sinking,    When Maggie, my wife, and I    Went riding through the valley,    The tear-drops in her eye.      \"One year ago to-day, Joe,    I saw the mossy grave;    We laid him neath the daisies,    My Uncle, good and brave.\"    And comrade, every springtime    Is sure to find me there;    There is something in the valley    That is always fresh and fair.      Our love is always kindled    While sitting by the stream,    Where two hearts were united    In love's sweet happy dream.          THE BOSTON BURGLAR        I was born in Boston City, a city you all know well,    Brought up by honest parents, the truth to you I'll tell,    Brought up by honest parents and raised most tenderly,    Till I became a roving man at the age of twenty-three.      My character was taken then, and I was sent to jail.    My friends they found it was in vain to get me out on bail.    The jury found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down,    The judge he passed me sentence and I was sent to Charleston town.

Thonis then  having heard their tale sent forthwith a message to Proteus at Memphis,  which said as follows: \"There hath come a stranger, a Teucrian by race,  who hath done in Hellas an unholy deed; for he hath deceived the wife  of his own host, and is come hither bringing with him this woman herself  and very much wealth, having been carried out of his way by winds to thy  land. Shall we then allow him to sail out unharmed, or shall we first  take away from him that which he brought with him?\" In reply to this  Proteus sent back a messenger who said thus: \"Seize this man, whosoever  he may be, who has done impiety to his own host, and bring him away into  my presence that I may know what he will find to say.\" Hearing this,  Thonis seized Alexander and detained his ships, and after that he  brought the man himself up to Memphis and with him Helen and the wealth  he had, and also in addition to them the suppliants. So when all had  been conveyed up thither, Proteus began to ask Alexander who he was and  from whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted to him his descent  and told him the name of his native land, and moreover related of his  voyage, from whence he was sailing. After this Proteus asked him whence  he had taken Helen; and when Alexander went astray in his account and did  not speak the truth, those who had become suppliants convicted him of  falsehood, relating in full the whole tale of the wrong done. At length  Proteus declared to them this sentence, saying, \"Were it not that I  count it a matter of great moment not to slay any of those strangers who  being driven from their course by winds have come to my land hitherto,  I should have taken vengeance on thee on behalf of the man of  Hellas, seeing that thou, most base of men, having received from him  hospitality, didst work against him a most impious deed. For thou didst  go in to the wife of thine own host; and even this was not enough for  thee, but thou didst stir her up with desire and hast gone away with her  like a thief. Moreover not even this by itself was enough for thee, but  thou art come hither with plunder taken from the house of thy host. Now  therefore depart, seeing that I have counted it of great moment not to  be a slayer of strangers. This woman indeed and the wealth which thou  hast I will not allow thee to carry away, but I shall keep them safe for  the Hellene who was thy host, until he come himself and desire to carry  them off to his home; to thyself however and thy fellow-voyagers I  proclaim that ye depart from your anchoring within three days and go  from my land to some other; and if not, that ye will be dealt with as  enemies.\"    This the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus; and  I suppose that Homer also had heard this story, but since it was not so  suitable to the composition of his poem as the other which he followed,  he dismissed it finally, making it clear at the same time that he was  acquainted with that story also: and according to the manner in which he  described the wanderings of Alexander in the Iliad (nor did he elsewhere  retract that which he had said) of his course, wandering to various  lands, and that he came among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this  the poet has made mention in the \"prowess of Diomede,\" and the verses  run thus:         \"There she had robes many-coloured, the works of women of Sidon,       Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander       Carried from Sidon, what time the broad sea-path he sailed over       Bringing back Helene home, of a noble father begotten.\"    And in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these verses:         \"Such had the daughter of Zeus, such drugs of exquisite cunning,       Good, which to her the wife of Thon, Polydamna, had given,       Dwelling in Egypt, the land where the bountiful meadow produces       Drugs more than all lands else, many good being mixed, many evil.\"    And thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos:         \"Still the gods stayed me in Egypt, to come back hither desiring,       Stayed me from voyaging home, since sacrifice due I performed not.\"    In these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wanderings of  Alexander to Egypt, for Syria borders upon Egypt and the Phenicians, of  whom is Sidon, dwell in Syria. By these lines and by this passage it is  also most clearly shown that the \"Cyprian Epic\" was not written by Homer  but by some other man: for in this it is said that on the third day  after leaving Sparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him Helen,  having had a \"gently-blowing wind and a smooth sea,\" whereas in the  Iliad it says that he wandered from his course when he brought her.    Let us now leave Homer and the \"Cyprian Epic\"; but this I will say,  namely that I asked the priests whether it is but an idle tale which  the Hellenes tell of that which they say happened about Ilion; and they  answered me thus, saying that they had their knowledge by inquiries from  Menelaos himself. After the rape of Helen there came indeed, they said,  to the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help Menelaos; and  when the army had come out of the ships to land and had pitched its  camp there, they sent messengers to Ilion, with whom went also Menelaos  himself; and when these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen  and the wealth which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos and had taken  away; and moreover they demanded satisfaction for the wrongs done: and  the Teucrians told the same tale then and afterwards, both with oath and  without oath, namely that in deed and in truth they had not Helen nor  the wealth for which demand was made, but that both were in Egypt; and  that they could not justly be compelled to give satisfaction for that  which Proteus the king of Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that  they were being mocked by them and besieged the city, until at last they  took it; and when they had taken the wall and did not find Helen, but  heard the same tale as before, then they believed the former tale and  sent Menelaos himself to Proteus. And Menelaos having come to Egypt and  having sailed up to Memphis, told the truth of these matters, and not  only found great entertainment, but also received Helen unhurt, and  all his own wealth besides. Then, however, after he had been thus dealt  with, Menelaos showed himself ungrateful to the Egyptians; for when  he set forth to sail away, contrary winds detained him, and as this  condition of things lasted long, he devised an impious deed; for he took  two children of natives and made sacrifice of them. After this, when it  was known that he had done so, he became abhorred, and being pursued he  escaped and got away in his ships to Libya; but whither he went besides  after this, the Egyptians were not able to tell. Of these things they  said that they found out part by inquiries, and the rest, namely that  which happened in their own land, they related from sure and certain  knowledge.    Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me; and I myself also agree with  the story which was told of Helen, adding this consideration, namely  that if Helen had been in Ilion she would have been given up to the  Hellenes, whether Alexander consented or no; for Priam assuredly was not  so mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desirous to run  risk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city, in order  that Alexander might have Helen as his wife: and even supposing that  during the first part of the time they had been so inclined, yet when  many others of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as often as  they fought with the Hellenes, and of the sons of Priam himself always  two or three or even more were slain when a battle took place (if one  may trust at all to the Epic poets),--when, I say, things were coming  thus to pass, I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his  wife, he would have given her back to the Achaians, if at least by so  doing he might be freed from the evils which oppressed him. Nor even  was the kingdom coming to Alexander next, so that when Priam was old the  government was in his hands; but Hector, who was both older and more  of a man than he, would certainly have received it after the death of  Priam; and him it behoved not to allow his brother to go on with his  wrong-doing, considering that great evils were coming to pass on his  account both to himself privately and in general to the other Trojans.  In truth however they lacked the power to give Helen back; and the  Hellenes did not believe them, though they spoke the truth; because,  as I declare my opinion, the divine power was purposing to cause them  utterly to perish, and so make it evident to men that for great wrongs  great also are the chastisements which come from the gods. And thus have  I delivered my opinion concerning these matters.    After Proteus, they told me, Rhampsinitos received in succession the  kingdom, who left as a memorial of himself that gateway to the temple of  Hephaistos which is turned towards the West, and in front of the gateway  he set up two statues, in height five-and-twenty cubits, of which the  one which stands on the North side is called by the Egyptians Summer and  the one on the South side Winter; and to that one which they call Summer  they do reverence and make offerings, while to the other which is called  Winter they do the opposite of these things. This king, they said, got  great wealth of silver, which none of the kings born after him could  surpass or even come near to; and wishing to store his"]]]
