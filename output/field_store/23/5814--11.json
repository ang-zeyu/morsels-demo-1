The Caliph, not satisfied with seeing, wished also to hear Nouronihar,  and eagerly turned to catch the sound of her voice; at last he  distinguished her whispering to one of her companions behind the thicket  from whence she had thrown the jasmine: \"A Caliph, it must be owned, is a  fine thing to see, but my little Gulchenrouz is much more amiable; one  lock of his hair is of more value to me than the richest embroidery of  the Indies; I had rather that his teeth should mischievously press my  finger than the richest ring of the imperial treasure.  Where have you  left him, Sutlememe? and why is he now not here?\"    The agitated Caliph still wished to hear more, but she immediately  retired, with all her attendants; the fond monarch pursued her with his  eyes till she was gone out of sight, and then continued like a bewildered  and benighted traveller, from whom the clouds had obscured the  constellation that guided his way; the curtain of night seemed dropped  before him; everything appeared discoloured; the falling waters filled  his soul with dejection, and his tears trickled down the jasmines he had  caught from Nouronihar, and placed in his inflamed bosom; he snatched up  a shining pebble, to remind him of the scene where he felt the first  tumults of love.  Two hours were elapsed, and evening drew on before he  could resolve to depart from the place; he often, but in vain, attempted  to go; a soft languor enervated the powers of his mind; extending himself  on the brink of the stream, he turned his eyes towards the blue summits  of the mountain, and exclaimed: \"What concealest thou behind thee? what  is passing in thy solitudes?  Whither is she gone?  O Heaven! perhaps she  is now wandering in thy grottos, with her happy Gulchenrouz!\"    In the meantime the damps began to descend, and the Emir, solicitous for  the health of the Caliph, ordered the imperial litter to be brought.  Vathek, absorbed in his reveries, was imperceptibly removed, and conveyed  back to the saloon that received him the evening before.    But let us leave the Caliph, immersed in his new passion, and attend  Nouronihar beyond the rocks, where she had again joined her beloved  Gulchenrouz.  This Gulchenrouz was the son of Ali Hassan, brother to the  Emir, and the most delicate and lovely creature in the world.  Ali  Hassan, who had been absent ten years on a voyage to the unknown seas,  committed at his departure this child, the only survivor of many, to the  care and protection of his brother.  Gulchenrouz could write in various  characters with precision, and paint upon vellum the most elegant  arabesques that fancy could devise; his sweet voice accompanied the lute  in the most enchanting manner, and when he sang the loves of Megnoun and  Leileh, or some unfortunate lovers of ancient days, tears insensibly  overflowed the cheeks of his auditors; the verses he composed (for, like  Megnoun, he too was a poet) inspired that unresisting languor so  frequently fatal to the female heart; the women all doted upon him; for  though he had passed his thirteenth year, they still detained him in the  harem; his dancing was light as the gossamer waved by the zephyrs of  spring, but his arms, which twined so gracefully with those of the young  girls in the dance, could neither dart the lance in the chase, nor curb  the steeds that pastured his uncle's domains.  The bow, however, he drew  with a certain aim, and would have excelled his competitors in the race,  could he have broken the ties that bound him to Nouronihar.    The two brothers had mutually engaged their children to each other, and  Nouronihar loved her cousin more than her eyes; both had the same tastes  and amusements, the same long, languishing looks, the same tresses, the  same fair complexions, and when Gulchenrouz appeared in the dress of his  cousin he seemed to be more feminine than even herself.  If at any time  he left the harem to visit Fakreddin, it was with all the bashfulness of  a fawn, that consciously ventures from the lair of its dam; he was  however, wanton enough to mock the solemn old grey-beards to whom he was  subject, though sure to be rated without mercy in return; whenever this  happened he would plunge into the recesses of the harem, and sobbing,  take refuge in the arms of Nouronihar, who loved even his faults beyond  the virtues of others.    It fell out this evening that, after leaving the Caliph in the meadow,  she ran with Gulchenrouz over the green sward of the mountain that  sheltered the vale where Fakreddin had chosen to reside.  The sun was  dilated on the edge of the horizon; and the young people, whose fancies  were lively and inventive, imagined they beheld in the gorgeous clouds of  the west the domes of Shadukiam and Amberabad, where the Peris have fixed  their abode.  Nouronihar, sitting on the slope of the hill, supported on  her knees the perfumed head of Gulchenrouz; the air was calm, and no  sound stirred but the voices of other young girls, who were drawing cool  water from the streams below.  The unexpected arrival of the Caliph, and  the splendour that marked his appearance, had already filled with emotion  the ardent soul of Nouronihar; her vanity irresistibly prompted her to  pique the prince's attention, and this she before took good care to  effect whilst he picked up the jasmine she had thrown upon him.  But when  Gulchenrouz asked after the flowers he had culled for her bosom,  Nouronihar was all in confusion; she hastily kissed his forehead, arose  in a flutter, and walked with unequal steps on the border of the  precipice.  Night advanced, and the pure gold of the setting sun had  yielded to a sanguine red, the glow of which, like the reflection of a  burning furnace, flushed Nouronihar's animated countenance.  Gulchenrouz,  alarmed at the agitation of his cousin, said to her with a supplicating  accent:    \"Let us be gone; the sky looks portentous, the tamarisks tremble more  than common, and the raw wind chills my very heart; come! let us be gone;  'tis a melancholy night!\"    Then, taking hold of her hand, he drew it towards the path he besought  her to go.  Nouronihar unconsciously followed the attraction, for a  thousand strange imaginations occupied her spirit; she passed the large  round of honeysuckles, her favourite resort, without ever vouchsafing it  a glance, yet Gulchenrouz could not help snatching off a few shoots in  his way, though he ran as if a wild beast were behind.    The young females seeing him approach in such haste, and according to  custom expecting a dance, instantly assembled in a circle, and took each  other by the hand; but Gulchenrouz, coming up out of breath, fell down at  once on the grass.  This accident struck with consternation the whole of  this frolicsome party; whilst Nouronihar, half distracted, and overcome,  both by the violence of her exercise and the tumult of her thoughts, sunk  feebly down at his side, cherished his cold hands in her bosom, and  chafed his temples with a fragrant unguent.  At length he came to  himself, and, wrapping up his head in the robe of his cousin, entreated  that she would not return to the harem; he was afraid of being snapped at  by Shaban, his tutor, a wrinkled old eunuch of a surly disposition; for  having interrupted the stated walk of Nouronihar, he dreaded lest the  churl should take it amiss.  The whole of this sprightly group, sitting  round upon a mossy knoll, began to entertain themselves with various  pastimes, whilst their superintendents the eunuchs were gravely  conversing at a distance.  The nurse of the Emir's daughter, observing  her pupil sit ruminating with her eyes on the ground, endeavoured to  amuse her with diverting tales, to which Gulchenrouz, who had already  forgotten his inquietudes, listened with a breathless attention; he  laughed, he clapped his hands, and passed a hundred little tricks on the  whole of the company, without omitting the eunuchs, whom he provoked to  run after him, in spite of their age and decrepitude.    During these occurrences the moon arose, the wind subsided, and the  evening became so serene and inviting, that a resolution was taken to sup  on the spot.  Sutlememe, who excelled in dressing a salad, having filled  large bowls of porcelain with eggs of small birds, curds turned with  citron juice, slices of cucumber, and the inmost leaves of delicate  herbs, handed it round from one to another, and gave each their shares in  a large spoon of Cocknos.  Gulchenrouz, nestling as usual in the bosom of  Nouronihar, pouted out his vermilion little lips against the offer of  Sutlememe, and would take it only from the hand of his cousin, on whose  mouth he hung like a bee inebriated with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#13)"],[1,"smartly dressed lady in the motor veil,  whom Philip had seen among the ruins.    'A trespasser! a trespasser!' cried the crowd; 'to prison with it!' and  angry, threatening voices began to arise.    'I'm no more a trespasser than he is,' said the voice, 'and if I say I  am the Deliverer, you can't stop me. I can kill dragons or do anything  _he_ can do.'    'Silence, trespasser,' said Mr. Noah, with cold dignity. 'You should  have spoken earlier. At present Sir Philip occupies the position of  candidate to the post of King-Deliverer. There is no other position open  to you except that of Destroyer.'    [Illustration: 'Silence, trespasser,' said Mr. Noah, with cold dignity.]    'But suppose the boy doesn't do it?' said the voice behind the veil.    'True,' said Mr. Noah. 'You may if you choose, occupy for the present  the position of Pretender-in-Chief to the Claimancy of the  Deliverership, an office now and here created expressly for you. The  position of Claimant to the Destroyership is also,' he added  reflectively, 'open to you.'    'Then if he doesn't do it,' said the veiled lady, 'I can be the  Deliverer.'    'You can try,' said Mr. Noah. 'There are a special set of tasks to be  performed if the claimant to the Deliverership be a woman.'    'What are they?' said the veiled lady.    'If Sir Philip fails you will be duly instructed in the deeds required  of a Deliverer who is a woman. And now, my friends, let us retire and  leave Sir Philip to deal with the dragon. We shall watch anxiously from  yonder ramparts,' he added encouragingly.    'But isn't any one to help me?' said Philip, deeply uneasy.    'It is not usual,' said Mr. Noah, 'for champions to require assistance  with dragons.'    'I should think not indeed,' said the veiled lady; 'but you're not going  the usual way about it at all. Where's the princess, I should like to  know?'    'There isn't any princess,' said Mr. Noah.    'Then it won't be a proper dragon-killing,' she said, with an angry  shaking of skirts; 'that's all I can say.'    'I wish it _was_ all,' said Mr. Noah to himself.    'If there isn't a princess it isn't fair,' said the veiled one; 'and I  shall consider it's my turn to be Deliverer.'    'Be silent, woman,' said Mr. Noah.    'Woman, indeed,' said the lady. 'I ought to have a proper title.'    'Your title is the Pretender to the----'    'I know,' she interrupted; 'but you forget you're speaking to a lady.  You can call me the Pretenderette.'    Mr. Noah turned coldly from her and pressed two Roman candles and a box  of matches into Philip's hand.    'When you have arranged your plans and are quite sure that you will be  able to kill the dragon, light one of these. We will then have a  princess in readiness, and on observing your signal will tie her to a  tree, or, since this is a district where trees are rare and buildings  frequent, to a pillar. She will be perfectly safe if you make your plans  correctly. And in any case you must not attempt to deal with the dragon  without first lighting the Roman candle.'    'And the dragon will see it and go away.'    'Exactly,' said Mr. Noah. 'Or perhaps he will see it and not go away.  Time alone will show. The task that is without difficulties can never  really appeal to a hero. You will find weapons, cords, nets, shields and  various first aids to the young dragon-catcher in the vaults below this  tower. Good evening, Sir Philip,' he ended warmly. 'We wish you every  success.'    And with that the whole crowd began to go away.    '_I_ know who you ought to have for princess,' the Pretenderette said as  they went. And Mr. Noah said:    'Silence in court.'    'This isn't a court,' said the Pretenderette aggravatingly.    'Wherever justice is, is a court,' said Mr. Noah, 'and I accuse you of  contempt of it. Guards, arrest this person and take her to prison at  once.'    There was a scuffling and a shrieking and then the voices withdrew  gradually, the angry voice of even the Pretenderette growing fainter  and fainter till it died away altogether.    Philip was left alone.    His first act was to go up to the top of the tower and look out to see  if he could see the dragon. He looked east and north and south and west,  and he saw the ramparts of the fort where Mr. Noah and the others were  now safely bestowed. He saw also other towers and cities in the  distance, and he saw the ruins where he had met Mr. Perrin.    And among those ruins something was moving. Something long and jointed  and green. It could be nothing but the dragon.    'Oh, Crikey!' said Philip to himself; 'whatever shall I do? Perhaps I'd  better see what weapons there are.'    So he ran down the stairs and down and down till he came to the vaults  of the castle, and there he found everything a dragon-killer could  possibly need, even to a little red book called the _Young  Dragon-Catcher's Vade Mecum, or a Complete Guide to the Good Sport of  Dragon-Slaying_; and a pair of excellent field-glasses.    The top of the tower seemed the safest place. It was there that he tried  to read the book. The words were very long and most difficultly spelt.  But he did manage to make out that all dragons sleep for one hour after  sunset. Then he heard a loud rattling sound from the ruin, and he knew  it was the dragon who was making that sound, so he looked through the  field-glasses, frowning with anxiety to see what the dragon was doing.    And as he looked he started and almost dropped the glasses, and the  frown cleared away from his forehead and he gave a sigh that was almost  a sob and almost a laugh, and then he said    'That old thing!'    Then he looked again, and this is what he saw. An enormous green dragon,  very long and fierce-looking, that rattled as it moved, going in and out  among the ruins, rubbing itself against the fallen pillars. And the  reason Philip laughed and sighed was that he knew that dragon very well  indeed. He had known it long ago. It was the clockwork lizard that had  been given him the Christmas before last. And he remembered that he had  put it into one of the cities he and Helen had built together. Only now,  of course, it had grown big and had come alive like all the other images  of live things he had put in his cities. But he saw that it was still a  clockwork creature. And its key was sticking out of its side. And it was  rubbing itself against the pillars so as to turn the key and wind itself  up. But this was a slow business and the winding was not half done when  the sun set. The dragon instantly lay down and went to sleep.    'Well,' said Philip, 'now I've got to think.'    He did think, harder than he had ever done before. And when he had  finished thinking he went down into the vault and got a long rope. Then  he stood still a moment, wondering if he really were brave enough. And  then he remembered 'Rise up, Sir Philip,' and he knew that a knight  simply _mustn't_ be afraid.    So he went out in the dusk towards the dragon.    He knew it would sleep for an hour. But all the same---- And the  twilight was growing deeper and deeper. Still there was plenty of light  to find the ruin, and also to find the dragon. There it lay--about ten  or twelve yards of solid dark dragon-flesh. Its metal claws gleamed in  the last of the daylight. Its great mouth was open, and its breathing,  as it slept, was like the sound of the sea on a rough night.    'Rise up, Sir Philip,' he said to himself, and walked along close to the  dragon till he came to the middle part where the key was sticking  out--which Mr. Perrin had thought was a piece of an old spear with which  some one had once tried to kill the monster.    Philip fastened one end of his rope very securely to the key--how  thankful he was that Helen had taught him to tie knots that were not  granny-knots. The dragon lay quite still, and went on breathing like a  stormy sea. Then the dragon-slayer fastened the other end of the rope to  the main wall of the ruin which was very strong and firm, and then he  went back to his tower as fast as he could and struck a match and  lighted his Roman candle.    You see the idea? It was really rather a clever one. When the dragon  woke it would find that it was held prisoner by the ropes. It would be  furious and try to get free. And in its struggles it would be certain to  get free, but this it could only do by detaching itself from its key.  When once the key was out the dragon would be unable to wind itself up  any more, and would be as good as dead. Of course Sir Philip could cut  off its head with the silver-hilted sword if Mr. Noah really wished it.    It was, as you see, an excellent plan, as far as it went. Philip sat on  the top of his tower quite free from anxiety, and ate a few hairy red  gooseberries that happened to be loose in his pocket. Within three  minutes of his lighting his Roman candle a shower of golden rain went up  in the south, some immense Catherine-wheels appeared in the east, and in  the north a long line of rockets presented almost the appearance of an  aurora borealis. Red fire, green fire, then rockets again. The whole of  the plain was lit by more fireworks than Philip had ever seen, even at  the Crystal Palace. By their light he saw a procession come out of the  fort, cross to a pillar that stood solitary on the plain, and tie to it  a white figure.    'The Princess, I suppose,' said Philip; 'well, _she's_ all right  anyway.'    Then the procession went back to the fort, and then the dragon awoke.  Philip could see the great creature stretching itself and shaking its  vast head as a dog does when it comes out of the water.    'I expect it doesn't like the fireworks,' said Philip. And he was quite  right.    And now the dragon saw the Princess who had been placed at a convenient  spot about half-way between the ruins and Philip's tower.    It threw up its snout and uttered a devastating howl, and Philip felt  with a thrill of horror that, clockwork or no clockwork, the"]]]
