She dreamed that she slept  beneath a great tree in the bottom of the Kor-ul-GRYF and that one of  the fearsome beasts was creeping upon her but she could not open her  eyes nor move. She tried to scream but no sound issued from her lips.  She felt the thing touch her throat, her breast, her arm, and there it  closed and seemed to be dragging her toward it. With a super-human  effort of will she opened her eyes. In the instant she knew that she  was dreaming and that quickly the hallucination of the dream would  fade--it had happened to her many times before. But it persisted. In  the dim light that filtered into the dark chamber she saw a form beside  her, she felt hairy fingers upon her and a hairy breast against which  she was being drawn. Jad-ben-Otho! this was no dream. And then she  screamed and tried to fight the thing from her; but her scream was  answered by a low growl and another hairy hand seized her by the hair  of the head. The beast rose now upon its hind legs and dragged her from  the cave to the moonlit recess without and at the same instant she saw  the figure of what she took to be a Ho-don rise above the outer edge of  the niche.    The beast that held her saw it too and growled ominously but it did not  relinquish its hold upon her hair. It crouched as though waiting an  attack, and it increased the volume and frequency of its growls until  the horrid sounds reverberated through the gorge, drowning even the  deep bellowings of the beasts below, whose mighty thunderings had  broken out anew with the sudden commotion from the high-flung cave. The  beast that held her crouched and the creature that faced it crouched  also, and growled--as hideously as the other. Pan-at-lee trembled. This  was no Ho-don and though she feared the Ho-don she feared this thing  more, with its catlike crouch and its beastly growls. She was  lost--that Pan-at-lee knew. The two things might fight for her, but  whichever won she was lost. Perhaps, during the battle, if it came to  that, she might find the opportunity to throw herself over into the  Kor-ul-GRYF.    The thing that held her she had recognized now as a Tor-o-don, but the  other thing she could not place, though in the moonlight she could see  it very distinctly. It had no tail. She could see its hands and its  feet, and they were not the hands and feet of the races of Pal-ul-don.  It was slowly closing upon the Tor-o-don and in one hand it held a  gleaming knife. Now it spoke and to Pan-at-lee's terror was added an  equal weight of consternation.    \"When it leaves go of you,\" it said, \"as it will presently to defend  itself, run quickly behind me, Pan-at-lee, and go to the cave nearest  the pegs you descended from the cliff top. Watch from there. If I am  defeated you will have time to escape this slow thing; if I am not I  will come to you there. I am Om-at's friend and yours.\"    The last words took the keen edge from Pan-at-lee's terror; but she did  not understand. How did this strange creature know her name? How did it  know that she had descended the pegs by a certain cave? It must, then,  have been here when she came.  Pan-at-lee was puzzled.    \"Who are you?\" she asked, \"and from whence do you come?\"    \"I am Tarzan,\" he replied, \"and just now I came from Om-at, of  Kor-ul-JA, in search of you.\"    Om-at, gund of Kor-ul-JA! What wild talk was this? She would have  questioned him further, but now he was approaching the Tor-o-don and  the latter was screaming and growling so loudly as to drown the sound  of her voice. And then it did what the strange creature had said that  it would do--it released its hold upon her hair as it prepared to  charge. Charge it did and in those close quarters there was no room to  fence for openings. Instantly the two beasts locked in deadly embrace,  each seeking the other's throat.  Pan-at-lee watched, taking no  advantage of the opportunity to escape which their preoccupation gave  her. She watched and waited, for into her savage little brain had come  the resolve to pin her faith to this strange creature who had unlocked  her heart with those four words--\"I am Om-at's friend!\" And so she  waited, with drawn knife, the opportunity to do her bit in the  vanquishing of the Tor-o-don. That the newcomer could do it unaided she  well knew to be beyond the realms of possibility, for she knew well the  prowess of the beastlike man with whom it fought. There were not many  of them in Pal-ul-don, but what few there were were a terror to the  women of the Waz-don and the Ho-don, for the old Tor-o-don bulls roamed  the mountains and the valleys of Pal-ul-don between rutting seasons and  woe betide the women who fell in their paths.    With his tail the Tor-o-don sought one of Tarzan's ankles, and finding  it, tripped him. The two fell heavily, but so agile was the ape-man and  so quick his powerful muscles that even in falling he twisted the beast  beneath him, so that Tarzan fell on top and now the tail that had  tripped him sought his throat as had the tail of In-tan, the  Kor-ul-lul. In the effort of turning his antagonist's body during the  fall Tarzan had had to relinquish his knife that he might seize the  shaggy body with both hands and now the weapon lay out of reach at the  very edge of the recess.  Both hands were occupied for the moment in  fending off the clutching fingers that sought to seize him and drag his  throat within reach of his foe's formidable fangs and now the tail was  seeking its deadly hold with a formidable persistence that would not be  denied.    Pan-at-lee hovered about, breathless, her dagger ready, but there was  no opening that did not also endanger Tarzan, so constantly were the  two duelists changing their positions. Tarzan felt the tail slowly but  surely insinuating itself about his neck though he had drawn his head  down between the muscles of his shoulders in an effort to protect this  vulnerable part. The battle seemed to be going against him for the  giant beast against which he strove would have been a fair match in  weight and strength for Bolgani, the gorilla. And knowing this he  suddenly exerted a single super-human effort, thrust far apart the  giant hands and with the swiftness of a striking snake buried his fangs  in the jugular of the Tor-o-don. At the same instant the creature's  tail coiled about his own throat and then commenced a battle royal of  turning and twisting bodies as each sought to dislodge the fatal hold  of the other, but the acts of the ape-man were guided by a human brain  and thus it was that the rolling bodies rolled in the direction that  Tarzan wished--toward the edge of the recess.    The choking tail had shut the air from his lungs, he knew that his  gasping lips were parted and his tongue protruding; and now his brain  reeled and his sight grew dim; but not before he reached his goal and a  quick hand shot out to seize the knife that now lay within reach as the  two bodies tottered perilously upon the brink of the chasm.    With all his remaining strength the ape-man drove home the blade--once,  twice, thrice, and then all went black before him as he felt himself,  still in the clutches of the Tor-o-don, topple from the recess.    Fortunate it was for Tarzan that Pan-at-lee had not obeyed his  injunction to make good her escape while he engaged the Tor-o-don, for  it was to this fact that he owed his life. Close beside the struggling  forms during the brief moments of the terrific climax she had realized  every detail of the danger to Tarzan with which the emergency was  fraught and as she saw the two rolling over the outer edge of the niche  she seized the ape-man by an ankle at the same time throwing herself  prone upon the rocky floor. The muscles of the Tor-o-don relaxed in  death with the last thrust of Tarzan's knife and with its hold upon the  ape-man released it shot from sight into the gorge below.    It was with infinite difficulty that Pan-at-lee retained her hold upon  the ankle of her protector, but she did so and then, slowly, she sought  to drag the dead weight back to the safety of the niche. This, however,  was beyond her strength and she could but hold on tightly, hoping that  some plan would suggest itself before her powers of endurance failed.  She wondered if, after all, the creature was already dead, but that she  could not bring herself to believe--and if not dead how long it would  be before he regained consciousness. If he did not regain it soon he  never would regain it, that she knew, for she felt her fingers numbing  to the strain upon them and slipping, slowly, slowly, from their hold.  It was then that Tarzan regained consciousness. He could not know what  power upheld him, but he felt that whatever it was it was slowly  releasing its hold upon his ankle. Within easy reach of his hands were  two pegs and these he seized upon just as Pan-at-lee's fingers slipped  from their hold.    As it was he came near to being precipitated into the gorge--only his  great strength saved him. He was upright now and his feet found other  pegs. His first thought was of his foe. Where was he? Waiting above  there to finish him? Tarzan looked up just as the frightened face of  Pan-at-lee appeared over the threshold of the recess.    \"You live?\" she cried.    \"Yes,\" replied Tarzan. \"Where is the shaggy one?\"    Pan-at-lee pointed downward. \"There,\" she said, \"dead.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed the ape-man, clambering to her side. \"You are  unharmed?\" he asked.    \"You came just in time,\" replied Pan-at-lee; \"but who are you and how  did you know that I was here and what do you know of Om-at and where  did you come from and what did you mean by calling Om-at, gund?\"    \"Wait, wait,\" cried Tarzan; \"one at a time. My, but you are all  alike--the shes of the tribe of Kerchak, the ladies of England, and  their sisters of Pal-ul-don. Have patience and I will try to tell you  all that you wish to know. Four of us set out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#13)"],[1,"me, and invited me to his house in Bloomsbury  Square, where he show'd me all his curiosities, and persuaded me to  let him add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely.    In our house there lodg'd a young woman, a milliner, who, I think, had  a shop in the Cloisters. She had been genteelly bred, was sensible and  lively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph read plays to her in  the evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he  followed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out  of business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her  child, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country  school, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he  wrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts.  This, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future  better fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he  once was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the  honour to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him,  acquainting me that he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, I  think it was, where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen  boys, at sixpence each per week), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care,  and desiring me to write to him, directing for Mr. Franklin,  schoolmaster, at such a place.    He continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of an  epic poem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks and  corrections. These I gave him from time to time, but endeavour'd  rather to discourage his proceeding. One of Young's Satires[41] was  then just published. I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which  set in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of  advancement by them. All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued to  come by every post. In the meantime, Mrs. T----, having on his account  lost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and us'd to  send for me and borrow what I could spare to help her out of them. I  grew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious  restraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted  familiarities (another erratum) which she repuls'd with a proper  resentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour. This made a breach  between us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he  thought I had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me.  So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him or  advanc'd for him. This, however, was not then of much consequence, as  he was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found  myself relieved from a burthen. I now began to think of getting a  little money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer's  to work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greater  printing-house.[42] Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.        [41] Edward Young (1681-1765), an English poet. See his      satires, Vol. III, Epist. ii, page 70.        [42] The printing press at which Franklin worked is      preserved in the Patent Office at Washington.    At my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at  press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'd  to in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing. I drank only  water; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of  beer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types  in each hand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wondered  to see, from this and several instances, that the _Water-American_, as  they called me, was _stronger_ than themselves, who drank _strong_  beer! We had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to  supply the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day a pint  before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a  pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the  afternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's  work. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he  suppos'd, to drink _strong_ beer, that he might be _strong_ to labour.  I endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by  beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley  dissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour  in a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a  pint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.  He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his  wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I was  free from. And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.    [Illustration: \"I took to working at press\"]    Watts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room,[43]  I left the pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five  shillings, was demanded of me by the compositors. I thought it an  imposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbade  my paying it. I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered  as an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief  done me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,  etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed  to the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly  admitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself  oblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of the folly of being on  ill terms with those one is to live with continually.        [43] Franklin now left the work of operating the printing      presses, which was largely a matter of manual labor, and      began setting type, which required more skill and      intelligence.    I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerable  influence. I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their chappel  laws,[44] and carried them against all opposition. From my example, a  great part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread,  and cheese, finding they could with me be supply'd from a neighbouring  house with a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled with  pepper, crumb'd with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the price  of a pint of beer, viz., three half-pence. This was a more comfortable  as well as cheaper breakfast, and keep their heads clearer. Those who  continued sotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of  credit at the alehouse, and us'd to make interest with me to get beer;  their _light_, as they phrased it, _being out_. I watch'd the  pay-table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engag'd for  them, having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their  accounts. This, and my being esteem'd a pretty good _riggite_, that  is, a jocular verbal satirist, supported my consequence in the  society. My constant attendance (I never making a St. Monday)[45]  recommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness at composing  occasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch, which was generally  better paid. So I went on now very agreeably.        [44] A printing house is called a chapel because Caxton,      the first English printer, did his printing in a chapel      connected with Westminster Abbey.        [45] A holiday taken to prolong the dissipation of      Saturday's wages.    My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another in  Duke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair of stairs  backwards, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept the house; she  had a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended the  warehouse, but lodg'd abroad. After sending to inquire my character at  the house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the same  rate, 3s. 6d. per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she  expected in having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, an  elderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's  daughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband,  whose memory she much revered; had lived much among people of  distinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the  times of Charles the Second. She was lame in her knees with the gout,  and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so sometimes wanted  company; and hers was so highly amusing to me, that I was sure to  spend an evening with her whenever she desired it. Our supper was  only half an anchovy each, on a very little strip of bread and butter,  and half a pint of ale between us; but the entertainment was in her  conversation. My always keeping good hours, and giving little trouble  in the family, made her unwilling to part with me, so that, when I  talk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearer my business, for two  shillings a week, which, intent as I now was on saving money, made  some difference, she bid me not think of it, for she would abate me  two shillings a week for the future; so I remained with her at one  shilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London.    In a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in the  most retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: that  she was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg'd  in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country not  agreeing with her, she returned to England, where, there being no  nunnery, she had vow'd to lead the life of a nun, as near as might be  done in those circumstances. Accordingly, she had given all her estate  to charitable uses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on,  and out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity, living  herself on water-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it. She had  lived many years in that garret, being permitted to remain there  gratis"]]]
