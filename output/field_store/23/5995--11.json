Ten years ago I took the prize for lemon pies at the county  fair, and I've never made any since for fear I'd lose my reputation  for them.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The first month of my stay passed not unpleasantly. The summer weather  was delightful, and the sea air was certainly splendid. Aunt  Philippa's little farm ran right down to the shore, and I spent much  of my time there. There were also several families of cousins to be  visited in the farmhouses that dotted the pretty, seaward-sloping  valley, and they came back to see me at \"Philippa's Farm.\" I picked  spruce gum and berries and ferns, and Aunt Philippa taught me to make  butter. It was all very idyllic--or would have been if Mark had  written. But Mark did not write. I supposed he must be very angry  because I had run off to Prince Edward Island without so much as a  note of goodbye. But I had been so sure he would understand!    Aunt Philippa never made any further reference to the reason Father  had sent me to her, but she allowed no day to pass without holding up  to me some horrible example of matrimonial infelicity. The number of  unhappy wives who walked or drove past \"Philippa's Farm\" every  afternoon, as we sat on the verandah, was truly pitiable.    We always sat on the verandah in the afternoon, when we were not  visiting or being visited. I made a pretence of fancy work, and Aunt  Philippa spun diligently on a little old-fashioned spinning-wheel that  had been her grandmother's. She always sat before the wood stand which  held her flowers, and the gorgeous blots of geranium blossom and big  green leaves furnished a pretty background. She always wore her  shapeless but clean print wrappers, and her iron-grey hair was always  combed neatly down over her ears. Joseph sat between us, sleeping or  purring. She spun so expertly that she could keep a close watch on the  road as well, and I got the biography of every individual who went by.  As for the poor young Methodist minister, who liked to read or walk on  the verandah of our neighbour's house, Aunt Philippa never had a good  word for him. I had met him once or twice socially and had liked him.  I wanted to ask him to call but dared not--Aunt Philippa had vowed he  should never enter her house.    \"If I was dead and he came to my funeral I'd rise up and order him  out,\" she said.    \"I thought he made a very nice prayer at Mrs. Seaman's funeral the  other day,\" I said.    \"Oh, I've no doubt he can pray. I never heard anyone make more  beautiful prayers than old Simon Kennedy down at the harbour, who was  always drunk or hoping to be--and the drunker he was the better he  prayed. It ain't no matter how well a man prays if his preaching isn't  right. That Methodist man preaches a lot of things that ain't true,  and what's worse they ain't sound doctrine. At least, that's what I've  heard. I never was in a Methodist church, thank goodness.\"    \"Don't you think Methodists go to heaven as well as Presbyterians,  Aunt Philippa?\" I asked gravely.    \"That ain't for us to decide,\" said Aunt Philippa solemnly. \"It's in  higher hands than ours. But I ain't going to associate with them on  _earth_, whatever I may have to do in heaven. The folks round here  mostly don't make much difference and go to the Methodist church quite  often. But _I_ say if you are a Presbyterian, _be_ a Presbyterian. Of  course, if you ain't, it don't matter much what you do. As for that  minister man, he has a grand-uncle who was sent to the penitentiary  for embezzlement. I found out _that_ much.\"    And evidently Aunt Philippa had taken an unholy joy in finding it out.    \"I dare say some of our own ancestors deserved to go to the  penitentiary, even if they never did,\" I remarked. \"Who is that woman  driving past, Aunt Philippa? She must have been very pretty once.\"    \"She was--and that was all the good it did her. 'Favour is deceitful  and beauty is vain,' Ursula. She was Sarah Pyatt and she married Fred  Proctor. He was one of your wicked, fascinating men. After she married  him he give up being fascinating but he kept on being wicked. _That's_  the men for you. Her sister Flora weren't much luckier. _Her_ man was  that domineering she couldn't call her soul her own. Finally he  couldn't get his own way over something and he just suicided by  jumping into the well. A good riddance--but of course the well was  spoiled. Flora could never abide the thought of using it again, poor  thing. _That's_ men for you.    \"And there's that old Enoch Allan on his way to the station. He's  ninety if he's a day. You can't kill some folks with a meat axe. His  wife died twenty years ago. He'd been married when he was twenty so  they'd lived together for fifty years. She was a faithful,  hard-working creature and kept him out of the poorhouse, for he was a  shiftless soul, not lazy, exactly, but just too fond of sitting. But  he weren't grateful. She had a kind of bitter tongue and they did use  to fight scandalous. O' course it was all his fault. Well, she died,  and old Enoch and my father drove together to the graveyard. Old Enoch  was awful quiet all the way there and back, but just afore they got  home, he says solemnly to Father: 'You mayn't believe it, Henry, but  this is the happiest day of my life.' _That's_ men for you. His  brother, Scotty Allan, was the meanest man ever lived in these parts.  When his wife died she was buried with a little gold brooch in her  collar unbeknownst to him. When he found it out he went one night to  the graveyard and opened up the grave and the casket to get that  brooch.\"    \"Oh, Aunt Philippa, that is a horrible story,\" I cried, recoiling with  a shiver over the gruesomeness of it.    \"'Course it is, but what would you expect of a man?\" retorted Aunt  Philippa.    Somehow, her stories began to affect me in spite of myself. There were  times when I felt very dreary. Perhaps Aunt Philippa was right.  Perhaps men possessed neither truth nor constancy. Certainly Mark had  forgotten me. I was ashamed of myself because this hurt me so much,  but I could not help it. I grew pale and listless. Aunt Philippa  sometimes peered at me sharply, but she held her peace. I was grateful  for this.           *       *       *       *       *    But one day a letter did come from Mark. I dared not read it until I  was safely in my own room. Then I opened it with trembling fingers.    The letter was a little stiff. Evidently Mark was feeling sore enough  over things. He made no reference to our quarrel or to my sojourn in  Prince Edward Island. He wrote that his firm was sending him to South  Africa to take charge of their interests there. He would leave in  three weeks' time and could not return for five years. If I still  cared anything for him, would I meet him in Halifax, marry him, and go  to South Africa with him? If I would not, he would understand that I  had ceased to love him and that all was over between us.    That, boiled down, was the gist of Mark's letter. When I had read it I  cast myself on the bed and wept out all the tears I had refused to let  myself shed during my weeks of exile.    For I could not do what Mark asked--I _could not_. I couldn't run away  to be married in that desolate, unbefriended fashion. It would be a  disgrace. I would feel ashamed of it all my life and be unhappy over  it. I thought that Mark was rather unreasonable. He knew what my  feelings about run-away marriages were. And was it absolutely  necessary for him to go to South Africa? Of course his father was  behind it somewhere, but surely he could have got out of it if he had  really tried.    Well, if he went to South Africa he must go alone. But my heart would  break.    I cried the whole afternoon, cowering among my pillows. I never wanted  to go out of that room again. I never wanted to see anybody again. I  hated the thought of facing Aunt Philippa with her cold eyes and her  miserable stories that seemed to strip life of all beauty and love of  all reality. I could hear her scornful, \"That's the men for you,\" if  she heard what was in Mark's letter.    \"What is the matter, Ursula?\"    Aunt Philippa was standing by my bed. I was too abject to resent her  coming in without knocking.    \"Nothing,\" I said spiritlessly.    \"If you've been crying for three mortal hours over nothing you want a  good spanking and you'll get it,\" observed Aunt Philippa placidly,  sitting down on my trunk. \"Get right up off that bed this minute and  tell me what the trouble is. I'm bound to know, for I'm in your  father's place at present.\"    \"There, then!\" I flung her Mark's letter. There wasn't anything in it  that it was sacrilege to let another person see. That was one reason  why I had been crying.    Aunt Philippa read it over twice. Then she folded it up deliberately  and put it back in the envelope.    \"What are you going to do?\" she asked in a matter-of-fact tone.    \"I'm not going to run away to be married,\" I answered sullenly.    \"Well, no, I wouldn't advise you to,\" said Aunt Philippa reflectively.  \"It's a kind of low-down thing to do, though there's been a terrible  lot of romantic nonsense talked and writ about eloping. It may be a  painful necessity sometimes, but it ain't in this case. You write to  your young man and tell him to come here and be married respectable  under my roof, same as a Goodwin ought to.\"    I sat up and stared at Aunt Philippa. I was so amazed that it is  useless to try to express my amazement.    \"Aunt--Philippa,\" I gasped. \"I thought--I thought--\"    \"You thought I was a hard old customer, and so I am,\" said Aunt  Philippa. \"But I don't take my opinions from your father nor anybody  else. It didn't prejudice me any against your young man that your  father didn't like him. I knew your father of old. I have some other  friends in Montreal and I writ to them and asked them what he was  like.

Philadelphia lost its commercial supremacy when the completion of the  Erie Canal gave return cargoes to foreign vessels discharging at New  York City. Oswego, N.Y., had the advantage of both harbor facilities and  water-power, but Syracuse, with practically no advantages except those  of leadership, has far outstripped it.    Such instances of the readjustment of centres of population have been  common in the past; they will also occur in the future. In nearly every  case the readjustment results from economic causes, the opening of new  lines of transportation, the lowering of the cost of the production of a  commodity, the discovery of new economic processes--all these cause a  disturbance of population, and the latter must readjust itself to new  and changed conditions.    Not all peoples have the necessary intelligence and training at first to  adapt themselves to their environment. For the greater part, the  American Indians were unable to take advantage of the wonderful  resources of the continent in which they lived. The Boers occupied about  the richest part of Africa, but made no use of the natural wealth of the  country beyond the grazing industry; in fact, their nomadic life reduced  them to a plane of civilization materially lower than that of their  ancestors.    People of the highest state of civilization do not always adjust  themselves to their environment readily. The people of the New England  plateau were nearly a century in learning that they possessed nearly all  the best harbors of the Atlantic coast of North America. When, however,  the great commerce of the country had been wiped out of existence, it  did not take them long to readjust themselves to the industry of  manufacture, the water-power being the natural resource that made the  industry profitable.

COLLATERAL REFERENCE    Any good cyclopaedia.          CHAPTER VIII    THE CEREALS AND GRASSES      Of all the plants connected with the economies of mankind the grasses  hold easily the first place. Not only are the seeds of certain species  the chief food of nearly all peoples, but the plants themselves are the  food of most animals whose flesh is used as meat. Wheat, maize, and rice  are used by all except a very few peoples; and about all the animals  used for food, fish and mollusks excepted, are grain eaters, or grass  eaters, or both.    The grasses of the Plains in Texas, the Veldt in South Africa, and the  hills of New Zealand by nature's processes are converted into meat that  feeds the great cities of western Europe and the eastern United States.  The corn of the Mississippi valley becomes the pork which, yielded from  the carcasses of more than forty million swine, is exported to half the  countries of the world. Even the two and one-half billion pounds of wool  consumed yearly is converted grass.    =Wheat.=--The wheat of commerce is the seed of several species of cereal  grass, one of which, _Triticum sativum_, is the ordinary cultivated  plant. Wild species are found in the highlands of Kurdistan, in Greece,  and in Mesopotamia, that are identical with species cultivated to-day.  It is thought that the cultivation of the grain began in Mesopotamia,  but it is also certain that it was grown by the Swiss lake-dwellers far  back in prehistoric times. It is the \"corn\" Joseph's brothers sought to  buy when they went to Egypt, and the records of its harvesting are  scattered all over the pages of written history.    [Illustration: THE GRAIN CROP--MODERN METHODS OF CULTIVATION AND  HARVESTING]    Of the one and one-half billion people that constitute the world's  population, more than one-third, or about eight times the population of  the United States, are consumers of wheat-bread; and this number is  yearly increasing by twelve million. Moreover, each individual of this  aggregate consumes yearly very nearly one barrel of flour, or about four  and one-half bushels of wheat. In other words, it requires somewhat more  than two billion three hundred million bushels of wheat each year to  supply the world's demand.[23] As a matter of fact the world's crop is  yearly consumed so nearly to the danger-line that very often the  \"visible supply,\" or the amount known to be in the market, is reduced to  a few million bushels.    Wheat will grow under very wide ranges of climate, but it thrives best  between the parallels of 25 deg. and 55 deg. In a soil very rich in  vegetable mould it is apt to \"run to stalk.\" A rather poor clay-loam  produces the best seed,[24] and a hard seed, rather than a heavy stalk,  is required.    In the latitude of Kansas the seeds planted in the fall will retain  their vitality through the winter; in the latitude of Dakota they are  \"winter-killed,\" as a rule. Because of this feature two broad classes or  divisions of the crop are recognized in commerce--the winter and the  spring varieties. In general, the spring wheats are regarded as the  better, and this is nearly always the case in localities too cold for  winter wheat. There are exceptions to this rule, however. In the main,  winter wheat ripens first, and is therefore first in the market.[25]    [Illustration: WHEAT]    In Europe the plain that faces the North and Baltic Seas, and that part  which extends through southern Russia, yield the chief part of the  crop, although the plains of the Po, the Danube, and Bohemia furnish  heavy crops. Russia, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy are all  wheat states.    In a normal year all Europe produces a little more than one-half  (fifty-five per cent.) of the world's crop. Russia and France excepted,  scarcely another state produces as much as is consumed. Great Britain  consumes her entire crop in three months; Germany in about six months.  France sends a part of her crop to Great Britain and buys of Russia to  fill the deficiency. Russia consumes but very little of her wheat-crop;  it is nearly all sold to the states of western Europe. All Europe  consumes about one billion seven hundred and ten million bushels, but  produces about one billion two hundred and fifty million; the remainder  is supplied by the United States, India, Argentina, Africa, and  Australia.    [Illustration: WHEAT IN UNITED STATES]    In the United States the great bulk of the crop comes from the upper  Mississippi valley and Pacific coast States. About one-third is  consumed where it is grown; more than one-third is required for the  populous centres of the east; a little less than one-third is exported,  of which about ninety per cent. goes to Europe.    [Illustration: WHEAT PRODUCTION]    Much of this, especially the Pacific coast product, is sold unground,  but each year an increasing amount is made into flour. The flour  manufacture of the United States aggregates somewhat more than  160,000,000 barrels yearly--the output of 16,000 flour-mills; the  Pillsbury mills of Minneapolis alone have a capacity of 60,000 barrels a  week. In Europe the Hungarian mills and their output of Bohemian flour  are the chief competitors of the United States.    [Illustration: WHEAT]    The wheat-crop of the Pacific coast has usually been a factor by itself.  On account of the absence of summer rains, the kernel is both plump and  hard. After the threshing process it is sacked and stored in the fields  in which it has grown.[26] Heretofore much of the sacked wheat has been  shipped to European markets by the Cape Horn route, but in late years a  yearly increasing amount is made into flour and sold in China, Japan,  and Siberia. In 1900 nearly two million barrels were thus sent.    East of the Rocky Mountains, after the grain is harvested much of it is  sold to dealers whose storage elevators[27] are scattered all over the  wheat-growing region, and at all great points of shipment, such as  Duluth, Minneapolis, Buffalo, and the eastern seaports. Before the grain  is transferred to the elevators it is inspected and graded, and the cars  which contain it are sealed. This wheat constitutes the \"visible  supply.\" All the business concerning it is transacted by means of  \"warehouse receipts,\" that have almost the currency of ready money.  Banks loan money on them almost to their market value.    Under normal conditions, the cost of growing and harvesting a bushel of  wheat--including interest on the land and deterioration of the  machinery, etc.--is between fifty and fifty-five cents. The market  price, when not affected by \"corners\" and other gambling transactions,  usually varies between sixty-two and eighty-five cents. The difference  between these figures is divided between the farmer and the \"middlemen,\"  the share of the latter being in the form of commissions and elevator  charges.    [Illustration: STORING PACIFIC COAST WHEAT]    In addition to bread-making wheat, certain varieties of grain known as  macaroni wheat have a certain importance in the market. Several  varieties are so hardy that they easily resist extremely cold winters;  they will also grow in regions too dry for ordinary varieties. In this  respect they are well adapted"]]]
