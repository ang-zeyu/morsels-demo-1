The editors of this work can not prove or disprove these allegations nor  prove or disprove the replies made to the allegations. We have not the  time or means to do so even if our interests, political or otherwise,  should prompt us to try it. From discussion of the partisan attacks on  and defense of the administration's course of action toward Russia in  1918-19, both of which are erratic and acrimonious, we plead to be  excused.    We shall tell the story of the genesis of the expedition as well as we  can. We do not profess to know all about it. It will be some time before  the calm historian can possess himself of all the facts. Till such time  we hope that this brief statement will stand. We offer it hesitatingly  with keen consciousness of the danger that it will probably suit neither  of the two parties in controversy over the sending of troops to North  Russia.    But we offer this straightforward story confidently to our late  comrades. They have entrusted us with the duty of writing the history of  what they did in North Russia as their bit in the Great World War. And  we know our comrades, at least, and we hope the general reader, too,  will credit us with writing in sincerity and good faith.    Early in 1918, for the Allied forces, it looked dark. The Germans were  able to neglect the crumbled-in Eastern Front and concentrate a tornado  drive on the Western Front. It was at last realized that the controlling  Bolshevik faction in Russia was bent on preventing the resumption of the  war on the Eastern Front and possibly might play its feeble remnants of  military forces on the side of the Germans. The Allied Supreme Council  at Versailles decided that the other allies must go to the aid of their  old ally Russia who had done such great service in the earlier years of  the war. On the Russian war front Germany must be made again to feel  pressure of arms. Organization of that front would have to be made by  efforts of the Allied Supreme War Council.    They had some forces to build on. Several thousand Czecho-Slovak troops  formerly on the Eastern Front had been held together after the  dissolution of the last Russian offensive in 1917. Their commander had  led them into Siberia. Some at that time even went as far as  Vladivostok. These troops had desired to go back to their own country or  to France and take part in the final campaign against the Germans. There  was no transportation by way of the United States. Negotiations with the  Bolshevist rulers of Russia, the story runs, brought promises of safe  passage westward across central Russia and then northward to Archangel,  thence by ship to France.    This situation in mind the Allied Supreme War Council urged a plan  whereby an Allied expedition of respectable size would be sent to  Archangel with many extra officers for staff and instruction work, to  meet the Czechs and reorganize and re-equip them, rally about them a  large Northern Russian Army, and proceed rapidly southward to reorganize  the Eastern Front and thus draw off German troops from the hard pressed  Western Front. This plan was presented to the Allied Supreme War Council  by a British officer and politician fresh from Moscow and Petrograd and  Archangel, enthusiastic in his belief in the project.    The expedition was to be large enough to proceed southward without the  Czechs, sending them back to the West by the returning ships if their  morale should prove to be too low for the stern task to be essayed on  the restored Eastern Front. General Poole, the aforementioned British  officer in command, seems to have been very sure that the Bolsheviks who  had so blandly agreed to the passage of the Czechs through the country  would not object to the passage of the expedition southward from  Archangel, via Vologda, Petrograd and Riga to fight the Germans with  whom they, the Bolsheviki, had compacted the infamous Brest-Litovsk  treaty.    All this while, remember, the old allies of Russia had preserved a  studied neutrality toward the factional fight in Russia. They steadily  refused to recognize the Bolshevik government of Lenine and Trotsky.    While this plan was still in the whispering stages, the activities of  the Germans in Finland where they menaced Petrograd and where their  extension of three divisions to the northward and eastward seemed to  forecast the establishment of submarine bases on the Murmansk and  perhaps even at Archangel where lay enormous stores of munitions  destined earlier in the war to be used by the Russians and Rumanians  against the Huns. At any rate, the port of Archangel would be one other  inlet for food supplies to reach the tightly blockaded Germans.    Since the autumn of 1914 military supplies of all kinds, chiefly made in  America and England, had been sent to Archangel for the use of the  Russian armies. At the time of the revolution against the old Czar  Nicholas, in 1917, there were immense stores in the warehouses of the  Archangel district and the Archangel-Vologda Railway had been widened to  standard gauge and many big American freight cars supplied to carry  those supplies southward. And these stores had been greatly augmented  during the Kerensky regime, the enthusiastic time immediately subsequent  to the fall of the Czar, when anti-German Russians were exulting \"Now  the arch traitor is gone, we can really equip our armies,\" and when the  Allies believed that after a few months of confusion the revolutionary  government would become a more trustworthy ally than the old imperial  government had been.

Consequently, when Kerensky disappeared the  government at Archangel did not greatly change in character.    To be sure, it had no army or military force of its own. The central  government sent north certain armed Red Guards, and agents of government  called \"commissars,\" who were to organize and control additions to the  Red Guards and to supervise also the civil government of Archangel  state, as much as possible. These people of the northern state were  indeed jealous of their rights of local government. And the work of the  Red agents in levying on the property and the man-power of the North was  passively resisted by these intelligent North Russians.    All this was of great interest to the Allied Supreme War Council because  of the danger that the war supplies would be seized by the rapidly  emboldened Bolshevik government and be delivered into the hands of the  Germans for use against the Allies. For since the Brest-Litovsk treaty  it had appeared from many things that the crafty hand of Germany was  inside the Russian Bolshevik glove.    Moreover, there were in North Russia, as in every other part, many  Russians who could not resign themselves to Bolshevik control, even of  the milder sort, nor to any German influence. Those in the Archangel  district banded themselves together secretly and sent repeated calls to  the Allies for help in ridding their territory of the Bolshevik Red  Guards and German agents, using as chief arguments the factors above  mentioned. While the anti-Bolshevists were unwilling to unmask in their  own state, for obvious reason, their call for help was made clear to the  outside world and furnished the Allied Supreme War Council just the  pretext for the expedition which it was planning for a purely military  purpose, namely, to reconstruct the old Eastern fighting front.    In fact, when a survey of the military resources of the European Allies  had disclosed their utter lack of men for such an expedition and it was  found that the only hope lay in drawing the bulk of the needed troops  from the United States forces, and when the statement of the cases in  the usual polite arguments brought from President Wilson a positive  refusal to allow American troops to go into Russia, it was only by the  emphasis, it is said, of the pathetic appeal of the North Russian  anti-Bolshevists, coupled with the stirring appeals of such famous  characters as the one-time leader of the Russian Women's Battalion of  Death and the direct request of General Foch himself for the use of the  American troops there in Russia as a military necessity to win the war,  that the will of President Wilson was moved and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#13)"],[1,"humankind would be pierced, even  unto death;[130] and showed that, when subdued by contrition His own  people would ask, \"What are these wounds in thy hands?\", the Lord would  answer: \"Those with which I was wounded in the house of my  friends.\"[131] The very price to be paid for the betrayal of the Christ  to His death was foretold as in parable.[132]    The fact, that these predictions of the Old Testament prophets had  reference to Jesus Christ and to Him only, is put beyond question by the  attestation of the resurrected Lord. To the assembled apostles He said:  \"These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you,  that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of  Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Then  opened he their understanding, that they might understand the  scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved  Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.\"[133]    John the Baptist, whose ministry immediately preceded that of the  Christ, proclaimed the coming of One mightier than himself, One who  should baptize with the Holy Ghost, and specifically identified Jesus of  Nazareth as that One, the Son of God, the Lamb who should assume the  burden of the world's sins.[134]    The predictions thus far cited as relating to the life, ministry, and  death of the Lord Jesus, are the utterances of prophets who, excepting  Adam and Enoch, lived and died on the eastern hemisphere. All save John  the Baptist are of Old Testament record, and he, a contemporary of the  Christ in mortality, figures in the early chapters of the Gospels. It is  important to know that the scriptures of the western hemisphere are  likewise explicit in the declaration of the great truth that the Son of  God would be born in the flesh. The Book of Mormon contains a history of  a colony of Israelites, of the tribe of Joseph, who left Jerusalem 600  B.C., during the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, on the eve of the  subjugation of Judea by Nebuchadnezzar and the inauguration of the  Babylonian captivity. This colony was led by divine guidance to the  American continent, whereon they developed into a numerous and mighty  people; though, divided by dissension, they formed two opposing nations  known respectively as Nephites and Lamanites. The former cultivated the  arts of industry and refinement, and preserved a record embodying both  history and scripture, while the latter became degenerate and debased.  The Nephites suffered extinction about 400 A.D., but the Lamanites lived  on in their degraded course, and are today extant upon the land as the  American Indians.[135]    The Nephite annals from the beginning thereof down to the time of our  Lord's birth abound in prediction and promise of the Christ; and this  chronicle is followed by a record of the actual visitation of the  resurrected Savior to the Nephites, and the establishment of His Church  among them. Unto Lehi, the leader of the colony, the Lord revealed the  time, place, and manner of Christ's then future advent, together with  many important facts of His ministry, and the preparatory work of John  the forerunner. This revelation was given while the company was  journeying in the wilderness of Arabia, prior to their crossing the  great waters. The prophecy is thus written by Nephi, a son of Lehi and  his successor in the prophetic calling: \"Yea, even six hundred years  from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord  God raise up among the Jews; even a Messiah; or, in other words, a  Savior of the world. And he also spake concerning the prophets, how  great a number had testified of these things concerning this Messiah, of  whom he had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world. Wherefore all mankind  were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be, save they  should rely on this Redeemer. And he spake also concerning a prophet who  should come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord; yea,  even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness. Prepare ye the way of  the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you  whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am  not worthy to unloose. And much spake my father concerning this thing.  And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he  also said he should baptize with water; even that he should baptize the  Messiah with water. And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he  should behold and bear record, that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who  should take away the sins of the world. And it came to pass after my  father had spoken these words, he spake unto my brethren concerning the  gospel which should be preached among the Jews; and also concerning the  dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah,  who should come, and after he had been slain, he should rise from the  dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the  Gentiles.\"[136]    At a later time Nephi writes, not as his father's scribe, but as a  prophet and revelator voicing the word of God as made known to himself.  He was permitted to behold in vision and to declare to his people the  circumstances of the Messiah's birth, His baptism by John and the  ministration of the Holy Ghost with its accompanying sign of the dove;  he beheld our Lord moving as a Teacher of righteousness among the  people, healing the afflicted and rebuking spirits of evil; he saw and  bore record of the dread scenes of Calvary; he beheld and predicted the  calling of the chosen Twelve, the apostles of the Lamb, for so these  were designated by Him who vouchsafed the vision. Moreover he told of  the iniquity of the Jews, who were seen in contention with the apostles;  and thus concludes the portentous prophecy: \"And the angel of the Lord  spake unto me again, saying, Thus shall be the destruction of all  nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the  twelve apostles of the Lamb.\"[137] Soon after the defection whereby the  distinction between Nephites and Lamanites was established, Jacob, a  brother of Nephi, continued in prophecy of the assured coming of the  Messiah, specifically declaring that He would minister at Jerusalem and  affirming the necessity of His atoning death as the ordained means of  human redemption.[138] The prophet Abinadi, in his fearless denunciation  of sin to the wicked king Noah, preached the Christ who was to  come;[139] and righteous Benjamin, who was at once prophet and king,  proclaimed the same great truth to his people about 125 B.C. So taught  Alma[140] in his inspired admonition to his wayward son, Corianton; and  so also Amulek[141] in his contention with Zeezrom. So proclaimed the  Lamanite prophet, Samuel, only five years prior to the actual  occurrence; furthermore he specified the signs by which the birth of  Jesus in Judea would be made known to the people of the western world.  Said he: \"Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh,  and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall  believe on his name. And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at  the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in  heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no  darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day,  therefore there shall be one day and a night, and a day, as if it were  one day, and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign;  for ye shall know of the rising of the sun, and also of its setting;  therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a  night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the  night before he is born. And behold there shall a new star arise, such  an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.  And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and wonders in  heaven.\"[142]    Thus the scriptures of both hemispheres and in all ages of ante-meridian  time bore solemn testimony to the certainty of Messiah's advent; thus  the holy prophets of old voiced the word of revelation predicting the  coming of the world's King and Lord, through whom alone is salvation  provided, and redemption from death made sure. It is a characteristic of  prophets sent of God that they possess and proclaim a personal assurance  of the Christ, \"for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of  prophecy.\"[143] Not a word of inspired prophecy relating to the great  event has been found void. The literal fulfilment of the predictions is  ample attestation of their origin in divine revelation, and proof  conclusive of the divinity of Him whose coming was so abundantly  foretold.      NOTES TO CHAPTER 5.    1. The Antiquity of Sacrifice as a Prototype of Christ's Atoning  Death.--While the Biblical record expressly attests the offering of  sacrifices long prior to Israel's exodus from Egypt--e.g. by Abel and by  Cain (Gen. 4:3, 4); by Noah after the deluge (Gen. 8:20); by Abraham  (Gen. 22:2, 13); by Jacob (Gen. 31:54; 46:1)--it is silent concerning  the divine origin of sacrifice as a propitiatory requirement prefiguring  the atoning death of Jesus Christ. The difficulty of determining time  and circumstance, under which the offering of symbolical sacrifices  originated amongst mankind, is recognized by all investigators save  those who admit the validity of modern revelation. The necessity of  assuming early instruction from God to man on the subject has been  asserted by many Bible scholars. Thus, the writer of the article  \"Sacrifice\" in the Cassell _Bible Dictionary_ says: \"The idea of  sacrifice is prominent throughout the scriptures, and one of the most  ancient and widely recognized in the rites of religion throughout the  world. There is also a remarkable similarity in the developments and  applications"]]]
