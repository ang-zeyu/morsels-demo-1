So, too, the  actual and vital experience which it brings to humanity is universal, is  offered with cosmic regularity, cannot be escaped. Through all the  tumult of the time, Christmas Week and the time that lies near to it is  always waiting to claim its own, to take to itself those who will not be  deceived, who see in the stupendous yearly pageant only the usual  spectacle of humanity trying to say divine things in terms of things  physical, because the time for the universal expression is not yet come.    When that time comes ... when the time of the worship of _things_ shall  be past; when the tribal sense of holiday shall have given place to the  family sense, and that family shall be mankind; when shall never be seen  the anomaly of celebrating in a glorification of little family  tables--whose crumbs fall to those without--the birth of him who  preached brotherhood; and the mockery of observing with wanton spending  the birth of him who had not where to lay his head; when the rudiments  of divine perception, of self-perception, of social perception, shall  have grown to their next estate; when the area of consciousness shall be  extended yet farther toward the outermost; when that new knowledge with  which the air is charged shall let man begin to know what he is ... when  that time comes, they will look back with utmost wonder at our uncouth  gropings to note and honour something whose import we so obscurely  discern; but perhaps, too, with wonder that so much of human love and  divining should shine for us through the mists we make.          X      Two days before Christmas Ellen Bourne went through the new-fallen snow  of their wood lot. Her feet left scuffled tracks clouded about by the  brushing of her gown's wet hem and by a dragging corner of shawl. She  came to a little evergreen tree, not four feet tall, with low-growing  boughs, and she stood looking at it until her husband, who was also  following the snow-filled path, overtook her.    \"Matthew,\" she said then, \"will you cut me that?\"    Matthew Bourne stood with his ax on his shoulder and looked a question  in slow preparation to ask one.    [Illustration: \"THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO SING 'GO BURY SAINT NICKLIS'\"]    \"I just want it,\" she said; \"I've--took a notion.\"    He said that she had a good many notions, it seemed to him. But he cut  the little tree, with casual ease and no compunctions, and they dragged  it to their home, the soft branches patterning the snow and obscuring  their footprints.    \"It's like real Christmas weather,\" Ellen said. \"They can't stop that  coming, anyhow.\"    In the kitchen Ellen's father sat before the open oven door of the  cooking stove, letting the snow melt from his heavy boots.    \"Hey,\" he said, \"I was beginning to think you'd forgot about supper.  What was in the trap?\"    At once Ellen began talking rapidly. \"Oh,\" she said, \"we'll have some  muffins to-night, father. The kind you like, with--\"    \"Well, what was in the trap?\" the old man demanded peevishly. \"Why  don't you answer back? What was, Mat?\"    Matthew, drying his ax blade, looked at it with one eye closed.    \"Rabbit,\" he said.    \"Where is it?\" her father demanded.    \"It was a young one--not as big as your fist,\" Ellen said. \"I let it out  before he got there. Where's mother?\"    \"Just because a thing's young, it ain't holy water,\" the old man  complained. \"Last time it was a squirrel you let go because it was  young--it's like being spendthrift with manna....\" he went on.    Ellen's mother appeared, gave over to Ellen the supper preparations,  contented herself with auxiliary offices of china and butter getting,  and talked the while, pleased that she had something to disclose.    \"Ben Helders stopped in,\" she told. \"He's going to the City to-morrow.  What do you s'pose after? A boy. He's going to take him to bring up and  work on the farm.\"    \"Where's he going to get the boy?\" Ellen asked.    Her mother did not know, but Mrs. Helders was going to have a new  diagonal and she wanted the number of Ellen's pattern. Ben would stop  for it that night.    Evenings their kitchen was a sitting room, and when the supper had been  cleared away and the red cotton spread covered the table, Ellen asked  her husband to bring in the little tree. She found a cracker box,  handily cut a hole with a cooking knife, and set up the little tree by  the kitchen window.    \"What under the canopy--\" said her mother, her voice cracking.    \"Oh, something to do in the evening,\" Ellen answered. \"Father's going to  pop me some corn to trim it with; aren't you, father? Mother, why don't  you get you a good big darning needle and string what he pops?\"    \"It'll make a lot of litter,\" said her mother, but she brought the  needle, for something to do.    \"Hey, king and country,\" said her father; \"I'd ought to have somebody  here to shell it for me.\"    \"Who you trimming up a tree for?\" her mother demanded; \"I thought they  wasn't to be any in town this year.\"    \"It ain't Christmas yet,\" Ellen said only. \"I guess it won't do any hurt  two days before.\"    While the two worked, Ellen went to the cupboard drawer, and from behind  her pile of kitchen towels she drew out certain things: walnuts, wrapped  in shining yeast tinsel and dangling from red yarn; wishbones tied with  strips of bright cloth; a tiny box, made like a house, with rudely cut  doors and windows; eggshells penciled as faces; a handful of peanut  owls; a glass-stoppered bottle; a long necklace of buttonhole twist  spools. A certain blue paper soldier doll that she had made was  upstairs, but the other things she brought and fastened to the tree.    Her husband smoked and uneasily watched her. He saw somewhat within her  plan, but he was not at home there. \"If the boy _had_ lived and _had_  been up-chamber asleep now,\" he thought once, \"it'd be something like,  to go trimming up a tree. But _this_ way--\"    \"What you leaving the whole front of the tree bare for?\" her mother  asked.    \"The blue paper soldier goes there. I want it should see the blue paper  soldier first thing....\" Ellen said, and stopped abruptly.    \"You talk like you was trimming the tree for somebody,\" her mother  observed, aggrieved.    \"Maybe something might look in the window--going by,\" Ellen said.    \"Get in there! Get your heads in there, ye beggars!\" said the old man to  the popcorn. \"I'd ought to have somebody here to pick up them shooting  kernels,\" he complained.    In a little while, with flat-footed stamping, Ben Helders came in. When  he had the pattern number, by laborious copying against the wall under  the bracket lamp, Matthew said to him:--    \"Going to get a boy to work out, are you?\"    Helders laughed and shifted.    \"He's going to work by and by,\" he said. \"We allow to have him to  ourselves a spell first.\"    \"Keep him around the house till Spring?\"    \"More,\" said Helders. \"You see,\" he added, \"it's like this with us ...  family all gone, all married, and got their own. We figured to get hold  of a little shaver and have some comfort with him before he goes to  work, for life.\"    \"Adopt him?\" said Matthew, curiously.    \"That's pretty near it,\" Helders admitted. \"We've got one spoke for at  the City Orphand Asylum.\"    Ellen Bourne turned. \"How old?\" she asked.    \"Around five--six, we figure.\" Helders said it almost sheepishly.    Ellen stood facing the men, with the white festoons of popcorn in her  hands.    \"Matthew,\" she said, \"let him bring us one.\"    Matthew stared. \"You mean bring us a boy?\" he asked.    \"I don't care which--girl or boy. Anything young,\" Ellen said.    \"Good Lord, Ellen,\" Matthew said, with high eyebrows, \"ain't you got  your hands full enough now?\"    Ellen Bourne lifted her hands slightly and let them fall. \"No,\" she  answered.    The older woman looked at her daughter, and now first she was  solicitous, as a mother.    \"Ellen,\" she said, \"you have, too, got your hands full. You're wore out  all the time.\"    \"That's it,\" Ellen said, \"and I'm not wore out with the things I want to  do.\"    \"Hey, king and country!\" the old man cried, upsetting the popper. \"Don't  get a child around here underfoot. I'm too old. I deserve grown folks.  My head hurts me--\"    \"Matthew,\" said Ellen to her husband, \"let Helders bring us one.  To-morrow--for Christmas, Mat!\"    Matthew looked slowly from side to side. It seemed incredible that so  large a decision should lie with a man so ineffectual.    \"'Seems like we'd ought to think about it a while first,\" he said  weakly.    \"Think about it!\" said Ellen. \"When haven't I thought about it? When  have I thought about anything else but him we haven't got any more?\"    \"Ellen!\" the mother mourned, \"you don't know what you're taking on  yourself--\"    \"Hush, mother,\" Ellen said gently; \"you don't know what it is. You had  me.\"    She faced Helders. \"Will you bring two when you come back to-morrow  night?\" she said; \"and one of them for us?\"    Helders looked sidewise at Matthew, who was fumbling at his pipe.    \"Wouldn't you want to see it first, now?\" Helders temporized. \"And a  girl or a boy, now?\"    \"No--I wouldn't want to see it first--I couldn't bear to choose. One  healthy--from healthy parents--and either girl or boy,\" Ellen said, and  stopped. \"The nicest tree thing I've made is for a boy,\" she owned.  \"It's a paper soldier.... I made these things for fun,\" she added to  Helders.    For the first time Helders observed the tree. Then he looked in the  woman's face. \"I'll fetch out a boy for you if you say so,\" he said.    \"Then do,\" she bade.    When the four were alone again, Mat sat looking at the floor. \"Every  headlong thing I've ever done I've gone headlong over,\" he said  gloomily."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#13)"],[1," failure early on Saturday  morning at the Castle of Pelesh, Sinaeia.    Yesterday Parliament was convoked, and the new King took the oath of  allegiance. Subsequently the Government issued a proclamation stating  that the new King would follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and  realize the ideals of the Rumanian race.    Both in itself and as an episode of the present European  conflagration, the death of the King of Rumania is an event of  singular importance. The late King was in many respects the maker of  his adopted country. When, in March, 1866, he accepted the crown the  condition of the Danubian principalities, Moldavia and Wallachia, was  little better than that of a misgoverned Turkish province. They still  owned Ottoman suzerainty, their army was non-existent, their financial  resources were precarious, the condition of their people was wretched,  their means of communication were primitive, and their public affairs  were in a condition bordering on anarchy. With the support of the  French Emperor, to whom he was distantly related, Prince Charles of  Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen faced one of the most difficult tasks ever  allotted to an inexperienced ruler, and carried it to triumphal  completion.    He created an army, introduced railways, won independence for his  realm and for himself. He evolved order out of chaos, secured military  renown at Plevna as commander of the joint Russo-Rumanian forces in  the Russo-Turkish war, established national finance on a sound basis,  built up a considerable export trade, extended the frontiers of the  principality and raised it to the rank of a kingdom, and watched with  untiring vigilance over every aspect of national development. Not only  as the first recognized and independent sovereign of modern Rumania,  but as her creator, King Charles will ever hold a foremost place in  Rumanian history.    In this great work the late ruler derived advantage, not only from his  eminent personal qualities, but from his foreign origin. As a German  Prince, powerfully connected, he stood outside and above Rumanian  party factions, and succeeded gradually in imposing his will on them  all. Born on April 20, 1839, at Sigmaringen, near the source of the  Danube, he was barely 27 when he accepted the call to rule an unknown  country with which his only connection was that, like the estates of  his family, it, too, was watered by the Danube. Of middle height, well  built, pronounced features, and clear, gray eyes, his personality  expressed quiet energy. His statecraft he learned by experience and  from the excellent counsel of his father, Prince Charles Anthony of  Hohenzollern, head of the senior and Roman Catholic branch of the  Hohenzollerns. Only once did he falter. In March, 1871, when the  French sympathizers of his subjects exposed him as a German Prince and  a Hohenzollern to great unpopularity, while the bankruptcy of the  Jewish speculator to whom his railway schemes had been intrusted threw  discredit upon his ideas of economic development, he summoned the  members of the Provisional Government from whom he had accepted the  crown and announced to them his decision to abdicate. Fortunately for  Rumania, they succeeded in dissuading him from his purpose. The  famous Conservative statesman, Lascar Catargi, formed a Ministry which  held office for five years and enabled the ruler to turn the most  dangerous corner of his reign. Thenceforward the path was  comparatively clear, though by no means easy. It led to Rumanian  participation in the Russo-Turkish war, to the conquest of national  independence, and eventually, on May 22, 1881, to his coronation as  King of Rumania, with a crown made of steel from a Turkish gun  captured by Rumanian troops at Plevna.    Yet the Rumanian triumph was not unalloyed. Russia injudiciously and  ungratefully insisted on depriving Rumania of the portion of Rumanian  Bessarabia of which Russia had been deprived after the Crimean war,  and allotted the Dobrudja, a swampy region south of the Danube, to the  principality as compensation. The indignation in Rumania was  indescribable and has never entirely subsided. The Senate in the  Chamber declared the resolve of the country to defend its integrity by  force. The Czar threatened to disarm the Rumanian Army--a threat which  drew from Prince Charles the proud reply: \"The Rumanian Army, which  fought so gallantly before Plevna under the eyes of the Czar, may be  annihilated, but will never be disarmed.\" But he nevertheless  recognized the futility of resistance to the Russian demand, and  exerted himself to calm the national excitement. In later years the  breach was partially if not wholly healed.    Of the more material achievements of his reign there is little space  to speak. The best record of his life is to be found in the present  condition of the country--_si monumentum requiris circumspice_. His  furtherance of the petroleum industry, of the export of grain, timber  and other agricultural produce, the building of the great bridge over  the Danube at Tchernavoda, and the extensive harbor at Constanza, the  network of railways, the immense system of fortifications defending  the capital, and the line Fokshani-Galatz--all these and much more are  mainly his work.    Little is yet known of the action of King Charles in the last crisis  of his life. It is a strange coincidence that just as the  Franco-German war of 1870-71 brought him into conflict with the  Francophil tendencies of his subjects and led to his offer of  abdication, so the present war should again have engendered rumors of  his abdication on account of his alleged antagonism to the national  desire for the acquisition of Transylvania and the Southern Bukovina,  which are peopled by more than 3,000,000 Hungarian and Austrian  Rumanes. The Rumanian people felt that the hour for the liberation of  their kindred had struck. Russia is understood to have invited Rumania  to occupy the desired territory. But King Charles, who brought and  kept Rumania within the orbit of the Triple Alliance, was, as a  Hohenzollern and a German Prince, averse to hostile action against the  German Emperor and the Emperor Francis Joseph. It is, moreover, stated  that he was bound by his word of honor never to take the field against  a Hohenzollern cause.    The late King Charles married, in November, 1869, Princess Elizabeth  of Wied, the gifted \"Carmen Sylva,\" whose brilliant literary and  artistic talents have gained her a worldwide reputation. The only  child of the marriage, the infant Princess Marie, died in 1874--a  bereavement that ever left a note of sadness in the lives of her  parents.      THE NEW KING.    King Ferdinand, who now succeeds his uncle on the throne of Rumania,  was born in August, 1865, and, like his predecessor, is a Hohenzollern  and a Roman Catholic.    Among his near relatives are the King of the Belgians and his  namesake, Tsar Ferdinand of the Bulgarians, who are both first  cousins, and his niece, Queen Augustina Victoria, the consort of Dom  Manoel. Through his mother, the Princess Antonia, who was born an  Infanta of Portugal, King Ferdinand is kin with all the house of  Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, to which his consort, the new Queen Mary,  belongs as daughter of the late Duke of Edinburgh.    Her Majesty is thus first cousin to King George and to the Czar, as  also to Princess Nicholas of Greece. Her three sisters are married  respectively to the Grand Duke Cyril of Russia, Prince Ernest, the  eldest son of the mediatized Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and to  the Infante Alfonso d'Orleans of Spain.    Their Majesties have six children, of whom the Crown Prince Carol, who  celebrates his 21st birthday this week, and the Princess Elizabeth,  born in 1894, are of marriageable age. The youngest, Prince Mircea,  who bears a historic Rumanian name closely connected with Silistria,  was born during the Balkan war at the beginning of 1913. King  Ferdinand's family is a remarkable example of religious  differences--his Majesty is a Roman Catholic, the Queen is a Lutheran,  and their children are members of the Orthodox Church of Rumania.    The Rumanian Minister has received a copy of a proclamation published  in The Official Gazette stating that the new King will follow in the  footsteps of the late monarch and will accomplish the ideals of the  Rumanian race.      IN RUMANIA'S PARLIAMENT.    [From The Messaggero of Rome.]    BUCHAREST, Dec. 17.    The intention of the Government to avoid in Parliament any discussion  of the political action of the Ministry was reaffirmed yesterday by  Premier Braliano, who, in a brief declaration in the Chamber, prayed  the parties to waive any discussion whatever upon the answer of  Parliament to the speech from the throne, and to have confidence in  those governing the country.    The independent Deputies, however, have shown themselves determined to  provoke a discussion. Among the others, Mr. Couza, a Nationalist,  demanded permission to express his personal admiration for the valor  of the Servians, and insisted on ample measures being taken for  preventing the exportation of articles of which in due time there will  be an absolute deficiency in the country.    Constantin Mille, an independent, and proprietor of the newspaper  Adeverul, delivered a long speech in which he declared himself  dissatisfied with the policy of the Government, which ought to have  taken a decisive stand at the beginning of the conflict. Instead of  doing this, the Government has put us in the position of not knowing  to which side we must turn, as long as our only intention is to turn  first to this side and then to that, without having the necessary  guarantees.    After paying high tribute to the valor of the Servian Army and the  heroism of Belgium, the speaker demonstrated that Rumania, since the  beginning of the conflict, ought to enter the war on the side of the  Triple Entente.
