After a short rest we hasten northwards again, for there is no question  of halting for the night. The darkness seems interminable, but at length  it begins to grow light again. Still the Persians do not stop, so there  is nothing for me to do but to struggle to keep up with them. \"Keep  awake, sir!\" shouts Gulam Hussein; \"you can sleep when we get to the  other side.\" Another day passes, and again we rest awhile to give the  camels some straw and to drink a cup of tea ourselves. Scarcely have we  begun to enjoy the rest, however, when the chimes of the bells ring out  again. The caravan is already on the move, so we pack up and follow in  its trail.    The sky seems very unpromising, and is clouded all over. The desert is  as level as a floor; not a mound as high as a kneeling camel. The sun  sinks in the west. Like a red-hot cannon-ball it shines through a rift  between dark clouds, and a shaft of dazzling red rays streams over the  desert, the surface of which shines like a purple sea. To the north the  sky is of a dark violet colour, and against this background the camels  stand out brick-red.    The sun sets, the colours grow pale, and the long shadows which the  camels lately cast far away over the ground fade away. Another night  rises up from the east. It grows darker and darker, the caravan is lost  to view, but the bells ring out with a clear resonance. On we go without  stop or rest. This night is more trying, for we had not a wink of sleep  the night before.    The clouds break in the zenith, and the moon looks down on our progress.  The camels are seen again and shadows fall again over the desert. Here  it is as bare and desolate as on the face of the moon.    At midnight the sky becomes dark once more. The Persians have clambered  up on to their camels, and the swaying motion soon carries them into the  land of dreams. Soon no one is awake but the leader, who guides the  first camel, and myself, who am riding on the last. Suddenly heavy  drops begin to fall, and in a minute the rain pelts down on camels,  loads, and sleepers.    In a second the pace of the caravan is changed. Hear how hurriedly and  anxiously the bells swing and beat! They peal as if to awaken soldiers  and citizens in a burning town. Now the rain patters down on the level  desert and the camels begin to slip. We must hasten if our lives are  dear to us, or the desert will suck us in at the eleventh hour. The men  shout to urge on the camels. Now the bells clang as though to wake up  the dead to judgment.    There goes a camel down in the mire. Poor animals, they are lost on such  ground, for they have not hoofs like horses, but soft callous pads. When  they slip they do so thoroughly and suddenly. All four legs fly up in  one direction, and the heavy body with the loads thumps down in the  other. It is bad enough for the camel, but still worse for his rider. A  moment before he sat so well packed up, longing for the edge of the  desert sea, and now he lies sprawling in the slush.    One after another the camels fall and have to be helped up again. All  this causes delay, and meanwhile the clay is gradually becoming softer.  At every step the camels sink in deeper, the rain still pelts down, and  the bells ring jerkily. If they cease to ring, it will be because the  desert has conquered; at this very moment they stop.    \"What is the matter?\" I call out.    \"We are at the Devil's ditch,\" answers a voice in the darkness.    The bells ring slowly again as the camels wade one after the other  through a trench full of salt water. I tighten my knees when my turn  comes. I cannot see the water, but I hear it spurting and splashing  round the legs of the camels in front of me. Now my camel slides down a  nasty mud bank. He slithers and wriggles about to keep himself up, and  then he, too, tramps through the water and scrambles up the other side.    \"Tamarisks,\" I hear some one shout. Welcome sound! It means that we are  safe, for nothing grows in the salt desert. When we come to the first  tamarisks we are again on sandy ground. Then all danger is past, and  what does it matter if we are dead tired? Two more hours and we reach a  village. There Gulam Hussein makes ready a chicken and some eggs, and  then I lie down in a hut and sleep as I have never slept before.    [Illustration: PLATE VI. TEBBES.    The tree in the foreground is a huge tamarisk.]      THE OASIS OF TEBBES    Any one who has not travelled himself for weeks together through the  desert can scarcely conceive what it is to come at length to an oasis.  An oasis is to the desert wanderer what a peaceful island with its  sheltered anchorage is to mariners. Oases are like stars in the dark  vault of heaven, like moments of happiness and prosperity in a man's  life. If you had roamed for two months in the wilderness, like myself  and my Persians, you would be able to understand our feelings when we at  last saw the date-palms of Tebbes beckoning to us in the distance (see  map, p. 73).    A lofty minaret rises above the little town, which is surrounded by a  wall (Plate VI.). Within are old buildings, mosques, and a fort with  towers. Outside the town are tilled fields and palm groves.    Spring had come when we pitched our tents on a meadow in the shade of  thick dark-green palms. There was a rustle and pleasant whisper among  the hard fronds when the spring storms swept over the country. We were  tired of the everlasting dull yellow tint of the desert and were  delighted with the fresh verdure. Outside my tent purled a brook of fine  cool water, all the more agreeable after the intense drought of the  desert. A nightingale sang in the crown of the palm above my tent. He  plays an important part in Persian poetry under the name of _bulbul_.    If you were in some mysterious manner transferred to Tebbes, you would  on the very first evening wonder what was the curious serenade which you  heard from the desert. If you sat at the fall of day reading at the door  of your tent, you would look up from your book and listen. You would  have an uneasy feeling and be uncomfortable at being alone in the tent.  But after the same serenade had been repeated every evening as regular  as the sunset, you would become accustomed to it, and at length trouble  yourself no more about it.    It is only the jackals singing their evening song. The word \"jackal\" is  Persian, and the jackal is allied to the dog, the wolf, and the fox. He  is a beast of prey and seeks his food at night. He is not large, is  yellowish-grey in colour, has pointed ears and small, keen eyes, and  holds his tail erect, not hanging down like the wolf's. Nothing edible  comes amiss to him, but he prefers chickens and grapes to fallen caravan  animals. If he can find nothing else, he steals dates in the palm  gardens, especially when ripe fruits have fallen after heavy storms.  The jackal is, indeed, a shameless, impudent little rascal. One night a  pack of jackals sneaked into our garden and carried off our only cock  under the very noses of the dogs. We were awakened by the noise of a  terrible struggle between the two forces, but the jackals got the better  of it and we heard the despairing cackle of the cock dying away in the  desert.    Heaven knows where the jackals remain as long as the sun is up! In  zoological text-books it is stated that they dwell in holes, but I could  see no holes round Tebbes, and yet jackals come in troops to the oasis  every night. They are as mysterious as the desert; they are found  everywhere and nowhere.    As soon as the sun sinks below the horizon and the darkness spreads its  veil over the silent desert, and the palms doze off, waiting for the  return of the sun, then begins the jackals' serenade. It sounds like a  short, sharp laugh rising and falling, a plaintive whine increasing in  strength and dying away again, answered by another pack in another  direction; a united cry of anguish from children in trouble and calling  for help. They say to one another, \"Comrades, we are hungry, let us seek  about for food,\" and gather together from their unknown lairs. Then they  steal cautiously to the skirts of the oasis, hop over walls and bars and  thieve on forbidden ground.    These insignificant noisy footpads live on the refuse and offal of the  desert from Cape Verde in the uttermost west of the Old World to the  interior of India; but their home is not in the silent desert alone.  When the military bands strike up at the clubs in Simla, you have only  to put your head out of the window to hear the mournful, piteous, and  distressed howl of the jackals.    They are not always to be treated lightly, for in 1882 jackals killed  359 men in Bengal alone. Especially are they a terrible danger when  hydrophobia rages among them, as the experiences of the last Boundary  Commission in Seistan showed. A mad jackal sneaked into the camp one  night and bit a sleeping man in the face. Within six weeks the man was  dead. Others stole into the natives' huts and lay in ambush, waiting for  an opportunity to bite. Perhaps the worst incident occurred on a dark  winter's night, when a north wind was raging and sweeping the dust along  the ground. A mad jackal came into the Englishmen's camp and crept into  a tent where several men were sleeping. Fortunately he only set his  teeth in a felt rug. This wakened the sleepers, however, and they at  once started up and looked for weapons. The camp consisted of three  sections, and more than a hundred tethered camels. In the pitchy  darkness it was impossible to see where the jackal went, but the camels  could be heard shrieking with fear, and thus it was only too clear where  the brute was. When day broke seventy-eight bitten dromedaries were  counted. They were isolated from the others, and killed as soon as they  showed signs of sickness, while the dogs and goats which had been bitten  by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#13)"],[1,"puppet, a tambourine player, all  scarlet and gold, about six inches high, and, unlike greater personages  when Fortune lets them drop, quite unspoiled and unhurt by its fall. It  was a pretty toy. Nello tried to find its owner, and, failing, thought  that it was just the thing to please Alois.    It was quite night when he passed the mill-house; he knew the little  window of her room; it could be no harm, he thought, if he gave her  his little piece of treasure-trove--they had been play-fellows so long.  There was a shed with a sloping roof beneath her casement; he climbed it  and tapped softly at the lattice; there was a little light within. The  child opened it and looked out half frightened.    Nello put the tambourine player into her hands. \"Here is a doll I found  in the snow, Alois. Take it,\" he whispered; \"take it, and God bless  thee, dear!\"    He slid down from the shed roof before she had time to thank him, and  ran off through the darkness.    That night there was a fire at the mill. Out-buildings and much corn  were destroyed, although the mill itself and the dwelling-house were  unharmed. All the village was out in terror, and engines came tearing  through the snow from Antwerp. The miller was insured, and would lose  nothing; nevertheless, he was in furious wrath, and declared aloud that  the fire was due to no accident, but to some foul intent.    Nello, awakened from his sleep, ran to help with the rest. Baas Cogez  thrust him angrily aside. \"Thou wert loitering here after dark,\" he said  roughly. \"I believe, on my soul, that thou dost know more of the fire  than any one.\"    Nello heard him in silence, stupefied, not supposing that any one could  say such things except in jest, and not comprehending how any one could  pass a jest at such a time.    Nevertheless, the miller said the brutal thing openly to many of his  neighbours in the day that followed; and though no serious charge was  ever preferred against the lad, it got bruited about that Nello had been  seen in the mill-yard after dark on some unspoken errand, and that he  bore Baas Cogez a grudge for forbidding his intercourse with little  Alois; and so the hamlet, which followed the sayings of its richest  landowner servilely, and whose families all hoped to secure the riches  of Alois in some future time for their sons, took the hint to give grave  looks and cold words to old Jehan Daas's grandson. No one said anything  to him openly, but all the village agreed together to humour the  miller's prejudice, and at the cottages and farms where Nello and  Patrasche called every morning for the milk for Antwerp, downcast  glances and brief phrases replaced to them the broad smiles and cheerful  greetings to which they had been always used. No one really credited the  miller's absurd suspicions, nor the outrageous accusations born of them;  but the people were all very poor and very ignorant, and the one rich  man of the place had pronounced against him. Nello, in his innocence and  his friendlessness, had no strength to stem the popular tide.    \"Thou art very cruel to the lad,\" the miller's wife dared to say,  weeping, to her lord. \"Sure, he is an innocent lad and a faithful, and  would never dream of any such wickedness, however sore his heart might  be.\"    But Baas Cogez being an obstinate man, having once said a thing, held  to it doggedly, though in his innermost soul he knew well the injustice  that he was committing.    Meanwhile, Nello endured the injury done against him with a certain  proud patience that disdained to complain; he only gave way a little  when he was quite alone with old Patrasche. Besides, he thought, \"If it  should win! They will be sorry then, perhaps.\"    Still, to a boy not quite sixteen, and who had dwelt in one little world  all his short life, and in his childhood had been caressed and applauded  on all sides, it was a hard trial to have the whole of that little world  turn against him for naught. Especially hard in that bleak, snow-bound,  famine-stricken winter-time, when the only light and warmth there could  be found abode beside the village hearths and in the kindly greetings  of neighbours. In the winter-time all drew nearer to each other, all  to all, except to Nello and Patrasche, with whom none now would have  anything to do, and who were left to fare as they might with the old  paralyzed, bedridden man in the little cabin, whose fire was often low,  and whose board was often without bread; for there was a buyer from  Antwerp who had taken to drive his mule in of a day for the milk of the  various dairies, and there were only three or four of the people who had  refused his terms of purchase and remained faithful to the little green  cart. So that the burden which Patrasche drew had become very light,  and the centime pieces in Nello's pouch had become, alas! very small  likewise.    The dog would stop, as usual, at all the familiar gates which were now  closed to him, and look up at them with wistful, mute appeal; and it  cost the neighbours a pang to shut their doors and their hearts, and let  Patrasche draw his cart on again, empty. Nevertheless, they did it, for  they desired to please Baas Cogez.    Noel was close at hand.    The weather was very wild and cold; the snow was six feet deep, and the  ice was firm enough to bear oxen and men upon it everywhere. At this  season the little village was always gay and cheerful. At the poorest  dwelling there were possets and cakes, joking and dancing, sugared  saints and gilded Jesus. The merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere on  the horses; everywhere within doors some well-filled soup-pot sang and  smoked over the stove; and everywhere over the snow without laughing  maidens pattered in bright kerchiefs and stout kirtles, going to and  from the mass. Only in the little hut it was very dark and very cold.    Nello and Patrasche were left utterly alone, for one night in the week  before the Christmas Day, death entered there, and took away from life  forever old Jehan Daas, who had never known life aught save its poverty  and its pains. He had long been half dead, incapable of any movement  except a feeble gesture, and powerless for anything beyond a gentle  word; and yet his loss fell on them both with a great horror in it; they  mourned him passionately. He had passed away from them in his sleep,  and when in the gray dawn they learned their bereavement, unutterable  solitude and desolation seemed to close around them. He had long been  only a poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, who could not raise a hand in  their defence; but he had loved them well, his smile had always  welcomed their return. They mourned for him unceasingly, refusing to be  comforted, as in the white winter day they followed the deal shell that  held his body to the nameless grave by the little gray church. They were  his only mourners, these two whom he had left friendless upon earth--the  young boy and the old dog.    \"Surely, he will relent now and let the poor lad come hither?\" thought  the miller's wife, glancing at her husband where he smoked by the  hearth.    Baas Cogez knew her thought, but he hardened his heart, and would not  unbar his door as the little, humble funeral went by. \"The boy is a  beggar,\" he said to himself; \"he shall not be about Alois.\"    The woman dared not say anything aloud, but when the grave was closed  and the mourners had gone, she put a wreath of immortelles into Alois's  hands and bade her go and lay it reverently on the dark, unmarked mound  where the snow was displaced.    Nello and Patrasche went home with broken hearts. But even of that poor,  melancholy, cheerless home they were denied the consolation. There was a  month's rent overdue for their little home, and when Nello had paid the  last sad service to the dead he had not a coin left. He went and begged  grace of the owner of the hut, a cobbler who went every Sunday night  to drink his pint of wine and smoke with Baas Cogez. The cobbler would  grant no mercy. He was a harsh, miserly man, and loved money. He claimed  in default of his rent every stick and stone, every pot and pan, in the  hut, and bade Nello and Patrasche be out of it on the morrow.    Now, the cabin was lowly enough, and in some sense miserable enough, and  yet their hearts clove to it with a great affection. They had been  so happy there, and in the summer, with its clambering vine and its  flowering beans, it was so pretty and bright in the midst of the  sun-lighted fields! Their life in it had been full of labor and  privation, and yet they had been so well content, so gay of heart,  running together to meet the old man's never-failing smile of welcome!    All night long the boy and the dog sat by the fireless hearth in the  darkness, drawn close together for warmth and sorrow. Their bodies were  insensible to the cold, but their hearts seemed frozen in them.    When the morning broke over the white, chill earth it was the morning  of Christmas Eve. With a shudder, Nello clasped close to him his only  friend, while his tears fell hot and fast on the dog's frank forehead.  \"Let us go, Patrasche--dear, dear Patrasche,\" he murmured. \"We will not  wait to be kicked out; let us go.\"    Patrasche had no will but his, and they went sadly, side by side, out  from the little place which was so dear to them both, and in which every  humble, homely thing was to them precious and beloved. Patrasche drooped  his head wearily as he passed by his own green cart; it was no longer  his,--it had to go with the rest to pay the rent,--and his brass harness  lay idle and glittering on the snow. The dog could have lain down beside  it and died for very heart-sickness as he went, but while the lad lived  and needed him Patrasche would not yield and give way.    They took the old accustomed road into Antwerp. The day had yet scarce  more than dawned; most of the shutters were still closed, but some of  the villagers were about."]]]
