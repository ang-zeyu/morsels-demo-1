The _Journal  Litteraire_, printed at the Hague, was chiefly composed by Prosper  Marchand, Sallengre, and Van Effen, who were then young writers. This  list may be augmented by other journals, which sometimes merit  preservation in the history of modern literature.    Our early English journals notice only a few publications, with little  acumen. Of these, the \"Memoirs of Literature,\" and the \"Present State of  the Republic of Letters,\" are the best. The Monthly Review, the  venerable (now the deceased) mother of our journals, commenced in 1749.    It is impossible to form a literary journal in a manner such as might be  wished; it must be the work of many, of different tempers and talents.  An individual, however versatile and extensive his genius, would soon be  exhausted. Such a regular labour occasioned Bayle a dangerous illness,  and Maty fell a victim to his Review. A prospect always extending as we  proceed, the frequent novelty of the matter, the pride of considering  one's self as the arbiter of literature, animate a journalist at the  commencement of his career; but the literary Hercules becomes fatigued;  and to supply his craving pages he gives copious extracts, till the  journal becomes tedious, or fails in variety. The Abbe Gallois was  frequently diverted from continuing his journal, and Fontenelle remarks,  that this occupation was too restrictive for a mind so extensive as his;  the Abbe could not resist the charms of revelling in a new work, and  gratifying any sudden curiosity which seized him; this interrupted  perpetually the regularity which the public expects from a journalist.    The character of a perfect journalist would be only an ideal portrait;  there are, however, some acquirements which are indispensable. He must  be tolerably acquainted with the subjects he treats on; no _common_  acquirement! He must possess the _literary history of his own times_; a  science which, Fontenelle observes, is almost distinct from any other.  It is the result of an active curiosity, which takes a lively interest  in the tastes and pursuits of the age, while it saves the journalist  from some ridiculous blunders. We often see the mind of a reviewer half  a century remote from the work reviewed. A fine feeling of the various  manners of writers, with a style adapted to fix the attention of the  indolent, and to win the untractable, should be his study; but candour  is the brightest gem of criticism! He ought not to throw everything into  the crucible, nor should he suffer the whole to pass as if he trembled  to touch it. Lampoons and satires in time will lose their effect, as  well as panegyrics. He must learn to resist the seductions of his own  pen: the pretension of composing a treatise on the _subject_, rather  than on the _book_ he criticises--proud of insinuating that he gives, in  a dozen pages, what the author himself has not been able to perform in  his volumes. Should he gain confidence by a popular delusion, and by  unworthy conduct, he may chance to be mortified by the pardon or by the  chastisement of insulted genius. The most noble criticism is that in  which the critic is not the antagonist so much as the rival of the  author.          RECOVERY OF MANUSCRIPTS.      Our ancient classics had a very narrow escape from total annihilation.  Many have perished: many are but fragments; and chance, blind arbiter of  the works of genius, has left us some, not of the highest value; which,  however, have proved very useful, as a test to show the pedantry of  those who adore antiquity not from true feeling, but from traditional  prejudice.    We lost a great number of ancient authors by the conquest of Egypt by  the Saracens, which deprived Europe of the use of the _papyrus_. They  could find no substitute, and knew no other expedient but writing on  parchment, which became every day more scarce and costly. Ignorance and  barbarism unfortunately seized on Roman manuscripts, and industriously  defaced pages once imagined to have been immortal! The most elegant  compositions of classic Rome were converted into the psalms of a  breviary, or the prayers of a missal. Livy and Tacitus \"hide their  diminished heads\" to preserve the legend of a saint, and immortal truths  were converted into clumsy fictions. It happened that the most  voluminous authors were the greatest sufferers; these were preferred,  because their volume being the greatest, most profitably repaid their  destroying industry, and furnished ampler scope for future  transcription. A Livy or a Diodorus was preferred to the smaller works  of Cicero or Horace; and it is to this circumstance that Juvenal,  Persius, and Martial have come down to us entire, rather probably than  to these pious personages preferring their obscenities, as some have  accused them. At Rome, a part of a book of Livy was found, between the  lines of a parchment but half effaced, on which they had substituted a  book of the Bible; and a recent discovery of Cicero _De Republica_,  which lay concealed under some monkish writing, shows the fate of  ancient manuscripts.[13]    That the Monks had not in high veneration the _profane_ authors, appears  by a facetious anecdote. To read the classics was considered as a very  idle recreation, and some held them in great horror. To distinguish them  from other books, they invented a disgraceful sign: when a monk asked  for a pagan author, after making the general sign they used in their  manual and silent language when they wanted a book, he added a  particular one, which consisted in scratching under his ear, as a dog,  which feels an itching, scratches himself in that place with his  paw--because, said they, an unbeliever is compared to a dog! In this  manner they expressed an _itching_ for those _dogs_ Virgil or  Horace![14]    There have been ages when, for the possession of a manuscript, some  would transfer an estate, or leave in pawn for its loan hundreds of  golden crowns; and when even the sale or loan of a manuscript was  considered of such importance as to have been solemnly registered by  public acts. Absolute as was Louis XI. he could not obtain the MS. of  Rasis, an Arabian writer, from the library of the Faculty of Paris, to  have a copy made, without pledging a hundred golden crowns; and the  president of his treasury, charged with this commission, sold part of  his plate to make the deposit. For the loan of a volume of Avicenna, a  Baron offered a pledge of ten marks of silver, which was refused:  because it was not considered equal to the risk incurred of losing a  volume of Avicenna! These events occurred in 1471. One cannot but smile,  at an anterior period, when a Countess of Anjou bought a favourite book  of homilies for two hundred sheep, some skins of martins, and bushels of  wheat and rye.    In those times, manuscripts were important articles of commerce; they  were excessively scarce, and preserved with the utmost care. Usurers  themselves considered them as precious objects for pawn. A student of  Pavia, who was reduced, raised a new fortune by leaving in pawn a  manuscript of a body of law; and a grammarian, who was ruined by a fire,  rebuilt his house with two small volumes of Cicero.    At the restoration of letters, the researches of literary men were  chiefly directed to this point; every part of Europe and Greece was  ransacked; and, the glorious end considered, there was something sublime  in this humble industry, which often recovered a lost author of  antiquity, and gave one more classic to the world. This occupation was  carried on with enthusiasm, and a kind of mania possessed many, who  exhausted their fortunes in distant voyages and profuse prices. In  reading the correspondence of the learned Italians of these times, their  adventures of manuscript-hunting are very amusing; and their raptures,  their congratulations, or at times their condolence, and even their  censures, are all immoderate. The acquisition of a province would not  have given so much satisfaction as the discovery or an author little  known, or not known at all. \"Oh, great gain! Oh, unexpected felicity! I  intreat you, my Poggio, send me the manuscript as soon as possible, that  I may see it before I die!\" exclaims Aretino, in a letter overflowing  with enthusiasm, on Poggio's discovery of a copy of Quintilian. Some of  the half-witted, who joined in this great hunt, were often thrown out,  and some paid high for manuscripts not authentic; the knave played on  the bungling amateur of manuscripts, whose credulity exceeded his purse.  But even among the learned, much ill-blood was inflamed; he who had  been most successful in acquiring manuscripts was envied by the less  fortunate, and the glory of possessing a manuscript of Cicero seemed to  approximate to that of being its author. It is curious to observe that  in these vast importations into Italy of manuscripts from Asia, John  Aurispa, who brought many hundreds of Greek manuscripts, laments that he  had chosen more profane than sacred writers; which circumstance he tells  us was owing to the Greeks, who would not so easily part with  theological works, but did not highly value profane writers!    These manuscripts were discovered in the obscurest recesses of  monasteries; they were not always imprisoned in libraries, but rotting  in dark unfrequented corners with rubbish. It required not less  ingenuity to find out places where to grope in, than to understand the  value of the acquisition. An universal ignorance then prevailed in the  knowledge of ancient writers. A scholar of those times gave the first  rank among the Latin writers to one Valerius, whether he meant Martial  or Maximus is uncertain; he placed Plato and Tully among the poets, and  imagined that Ennius and Statius were contemporaries. A library of six  hundred volumes was then considered as an extraordinary collection.    Among"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#13)"],[1,"of the acts?  Certainly  not.  Theirs was the attitude of the social student, of the man who  knows that beyond every violent act there is a vital cause.    Bjornstjerne Bjornson, in the second part of BEYOND HUMAN POWER,  emphasizes the fact that it is among the Anarchists that we must look  for the modern martyrs who pay for their faith with their blood, and  who welcome death with a smile, because they believe, as truly as  Christ did, that their martyrdom will redeem humanity.    Francois Coppee, the French novelist, thus expresses himself  regarding the psychology of the ATTENTATER:    \"The reading of the details of Vaillant's execution left me in a  thoughtful mood.  I imagined him expanding his chest under the ropes,  marching with firm step, stiffening his will, concentrating all his  energy, and, with eyes fixed upon the knife, hurling finally at  society his cry of malediction.  And, in spite of me, another  spectacle rose suddenly before my mind.  I saw a group of men and  women pressing against each other in the middle of the oblong arena  of the circus, under the gaze of thousands of eyes, while from all  the steps of the immense amphitheatre went up the terrible cry, AD  LEONES! and, below, the opening cages of the wild beasts.    \"I did not believe the execution would take place.  In the first  place, no victim had been struck with death, and it had long been the  custom not to punish an abortive crime with the last degree of  severity.  Then, this crime, however terrible in intention, was  disinterested, born of an abstract idea.  The man's past, his  abandoned childhood, his life of hardship, pleaded also in his favor.  In the independent press generous voices were raised in his behalf,  very loud and eloquent.  'A purely literary current of opinion' some  have said, with no little scorn.  IT IS, ON THE CONTRARY, AN HONOR TO  THE MEN OF ART AND THOUGHT TO HAVE EXPRESSED ONCE MORE THEIR DISGUST  AT THE SCAFFOLD.\"    Again Zola, in GERMINAL and PARIS, describes the tenderness and  kindness, the deep sympathy with human suffering, of these men who  close the chapter of their lives with a violent outbreak against our  system.    Last, but not least, the man who probably better than anyone else  understands the psychology of the ATTENTATER is M. Hamon, the author  of the brilliant work, UNE PSYCHOLOGIE DU MILITAIRE PROFESSIONEL, who  has arrived at these suggestive conclusions:    \"The positive method confirmed by the rational method enables us to  establish an ideal type of Anarchist, whose mentality is the  aggregate of common psychic characteristics.  Every Anarchist  partakes sufficiently of this ideal type to make it possible to  differentiate him from other men.  The typical Anarchist, then, may  be defined as follows: A man perceptible by the spirit of revolt  under one or more of its forms,--opposition, investigation,  criticism, innovation,--endowed with a strong love of liberty,  egoistic or individualistic, and possessed of great curiosity, a keen  desire to know.  These traits are supplemented by an ardent love of  others, a highly developed moral sensitiveness, a profound sentiment  of justice, and imbued with missionary zeal.\"    To the above characteristics, says Alvin F. Sanborn, must be added  these sterling qualities: a rare love of animals, surpassing  sweetness in all the ordinary relations of life, exceptional sobriety  of demeanor, frugality and regularity, austerity, even, of living,  and courage beyond compare.[2]    \"There is a truism that the man in the street seems always to forget,  when he is abusing the Anarchists, or whatever party happens to be  his BETE NOIRE for the moment, as the cause of some outrage just  perpetrated.  This indisputable fact is that homicidal outrages have,  from time immemorial, been the reply of goaded and desperate classes,  and goaded and desperate individuals, to wrongs from their fellowmen,  which they felt to be intolerable.  Such acts are the violent recoil  from violence, whether aggressive or repressive; they are the last  desperate struggle of outraged and exasperated human nature for  breathing space and life.  And their cause lies not in any special  conviction, but in the depths of that human nature itself.  The whole  course of history, political and social, is strewn with evidence of  this fact.  To go no further, take the three most notorious examples  of political parties goaded into violence during the last fifty  years: the Mazzinians in Italy, the Fenians in Ireland, and the  Terrorists in Russia.  Were these people Anarchists?  No.  Did they  all three even hold the same political opinions?  No.  The Mazzinians  were Republicans, the Fenians political separatists, the Russians  Social Democrats or Constitutionalists.  But all were driven by  desperate circumstances into this terrible form of revolt.  And when  we turn from parties to individuals who have acted in like manner, we  stand appalled by the number of human beings goaded and driven by  sheer desperation into conduct obviously violently opposed to their  social instincts.    \"Now that Anarchism has become a living force in society, such deeds  have been sometimes committed by Anarchists, as well as by others.  For no new faith, even the most essentially peaceable and humane the  mind of man has yet accepted, but at its first coming has brought  upon earth not peace, but a sword; not because of anything violent or  anti-social in the doctrine itself; simply because of the ferment any  new and creative idea excites in men's minds, whether they accept or  reject it.  And a conception of Anarchism, which, on one hand,  threatens every vested interest, and, on the other, holds out a  vision of a free and noble life to be won by a struggle against  existing wrongs, is certain to rouse the fiercest opposition, and  bring the whole repressive force of ancient evil into violent contact  with the tumultuous outburst of a new hope.    \"Under miserable conditions of life, any vision of the possibility of  better things makes the present misery more intolerable, and spurs  those who suffer to the most energetic struggles to improve their  lot, and if these struggles only immediately result in sharper  misery, the outcome is sheer desperation.  In our present society,  for instance, an exploited wage worker, who catches a glimpse of what  work and life might and ought to be, finds the toilsome routine and  the squalor of his existence almost intolerable; and even when he has  the resolution and courage to continue steadily working his best, and  waiting until new ideas have so permeated society as to pave the way  for better times, the mere fact that he has such ideas and tries to  spread them, brings him into difficulties with his employers.  How  many thousands of Socialists, and above all Anarchists, have lost  work and even the chance of work, solely on the ground of their  opinions.  It is only the specially gifted craftsman, who, if he be a  zealous propagandist, can hope to retain permanent employment.  And  what happens to a man with his brain working actively with a ferment  of new ideas, with a vision before his eyes of a new hope dawning for  toiling and agonizing men, with the knowledge that his suffering and  that of his fellows in misery is not caused by the cruelty of fate,  but by the injustice of other human beings,--what happens to such a  man when he sees those dear to him starving, when he himself is  starved?  Some natures in such a plight, and those by no means the  least social or the least sensitive, will become violent, and will  even feel that their violence is social and not anti-social, that in  striking when and how they can, they are striking, not for  themselves, but for human nature, outraged and despoiled in their  persons and in those of their fellow sufferers.  And are we, who  ourselves are not in this horrible predicament, to stand by and  coldly condemn these piteous victims of the Furies and Fates?  Are we  to decry as miscreants these human beings who act with heroic  self-devotion, sacrificing their lives in protest, where less social  and less energetic natures would lie down and grovel in abject  submission to injustice and wrong?  Are we to join the ignorant and  brutal outcry which stigmatizes such men as monsters of wickedness,  gratuitously running amuck in a harmonious and innocently peaceful  society?  No!  We hate murder with a hatred that may seem absurdly  exaggerated to apologists for Matabele massacres, to callous  acquiescers in hangings and bombardments, but we decline in such  cases of homicide, or attempted homicide, as those of which we are  treating, to be guilty of the cruel injustice of flinging the whole  responsibility of the deed upon the immediate perpetrator.  The guilt  of these homicides lies upon every man and woman who, intentionally  or by cold indifference, helps to keep up social conditions that  drive human beings to despair.  The man who flings his whole life  into the attempt, at the cost of his own life, to protest against the  wrongs of his fellow men, is a saint compared to the active and  passive upholders of cruelty and injustice, even if his protest  destroy other lives besides his own.  Let him who is without sin in  society cast the first stone at such an one.\"[3]    That every act of political violence should nowadays be attributed to  Anarchists is not at all surprising.  Yet it is a fact known to  almost everyone familiar with the Anarchist movement that a great  number of acts, for which Anarchists had to suffer, either originated  with the capitalist press or were instigated, if not directly  perpetrated, by the police.    For a number of years acts of violence had been committed in Spain,  for which the Anarchists were held responsible, hounded like wild  beasts, and thrown into prison.  Later it was disclosed that the  perpetrators of these acts were not Anarchists, but members of "]]]
