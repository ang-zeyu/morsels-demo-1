The arcading is a nineteenth-century imitation of Norman  work; the pavement is glaringly modern. Of what interest, it may well be  asked, is such work? Who would care to visit Christchurch to see it? The  nineteenth-century carver cannot possibly produce work similar to that  of the carver who lived in the twelfth century,--the conditions of his  life are altogether different, his training bears no resemblance to that  of the old artist, his work is a forgery, and a most clumsy one too. In  this chapel we see this reprehensible practice carried to its fullest  extent, but there are many other parts of the building which have  suffered. Most of the arcading on the exterior of the transept is modern  imitation, and the tracery of the windows of the south choir aisle has  been entirely renewed; no old stones, though many might have been used,  have been reset in their original position. The arcading of the south  aisle of the nave has been terribly tampered with. Possibly under the  influence of time many of the shafts had partially crumbled, and the  surface of the carved capitals had perished, so that the original design  could not be made out; but that was no reason for cutting away the  ornamental work to make way for modern decoration which may or may not  bear some slight resemblance to what was there before. Some of the piers  of the nave arcading have also been partially renewed. By an act of  much-to-be-condemned vandalism the sub-arches of the two eastern bays  of the south triforium of the nave were cut away to make room for  faculty pews; recently a glaring white pillar has been introduced into  the westernmost of these two bays, and two sub-arches built. If the  same kind of work is carried out in the other, we shall see in all  probability an attempt to copy the unique scale decoration which still  exists on the tympanum under the corresponding principal arch on the  north side, cut with modern tools with all the lifeless rigidity of  modern work. Another mistake which has been made, is the scraping off of  the plaster from the interior walls of the chamber known as St Michael's  Loft, over the Lady Chapel, and the re-pointing of the stonework. Old  builders invariably covered their rubble walls with plaster, but the  modern restorer for some reason seems to hate plaster and prefers, to  show the coarse stonework which the builder never intended should be  seen, and to emphasise the roughness by filling up the joints with  conspicuous pointing. This, however, is not so destructive as much of  the work which has been condemned above, because at any time the walls  could be recovered with a thin coat of smooth plaster laid on with a  trowel, but not \"floated,\"--that is, not brought to a smooth surface  by a long straightedge.    A large and old building such as this Priory Church will need almost  constant repairs to keep it sound and safe, and the income from  visitors' fees is quite sufficient for this purpose. It is, however,  much to be feared that restoration and reconstruction will form far too  large a part of the work done in this building. Every new ornamental  stone, to make room for which some original stone is displaced, detracts  from the value of the building from an archaeological point of view; and  though there may be some, or even many, who prefer the trim and smug  appearance of modern work to that of the old, instinct with life, full  of the thoughts of the builders and workers in wood and stone, whose  bones have mouldered into dust in the garth of the vanished cloisters,  and whose very names have in many cases been forgotten, yet we hope that  those who have this priceless treasure in their keeping may recognise  ere it is too late, that the result of a continuance of the process of  restoration commenced about the middle of the nineteenth century will  be the gradual conversion of a splendid memorial of bygone ages into a  modern sham, and they themselves will be regarded, when true love of art  becomes general, with the same indignation as that which they themselves  feel with regard to those who pulled down the roof of the south transept  and cut out the columns and sub-arches of the triforium in days before  the Gothic revival set in. And the modern restorer has less excuse than  the destroyer of a hundred years ago. If, like the vandals of the  Georgian period, they had been blind to the beauties of architectural  art, they would have had no sin, yet since they profess to see,  therefore their sin will remain and their names will be held in  perpetual reproach and everlasting contempt.    The foregoing historical sketch of the building has perforce been  somewhat vague in dates, for, in the absence of documentary evidence, it  is not easy to fix from architectural considerations alone the date of  any particular piece of work within a limit of some twenty years or so.  The out-of-the-way position of the Priory of Christchurch--for no great  road ran through the town, and though it is near the sea there is no  convenient harbour near it--has brought it to pass that it is scarcely  mentioned in any mediaeval chronicles. Its own fabric rolls and annals  have been lost. Here and there, however, the date of a will or the  inscription on a monument has enabled a more definite date to be arrived  at. The dates also of the dedications of some of the many altars are  known--viz. that of the Holy Saviour, used by the canons as their high  altar, and that of St Stephen, dedicated by the Bishop of Ross in 1199;  that of the altar of the Holy Trinity, which stood in the nave, and was  the high altar of the parish; and those of the altars of SS. Peter and  Paul, SS. Augustine and Gregory and all the Prophets, dedicated by  Walter, Bishop of Whitherne, on November 7, 1214; that of the altar of  St John the Baptist and St Edmund, dedicated on December 7, 1214, by the  same bishop; and that of the altar of SS. Michael and Martin, dedicated  by the Bishop of the Isles in 1221.          CHAPTER II    THE EXTERIOR      The exterior of the church of Christchurch Priory may be well seen from  several points of view. The churchyard lies to the north of the  building, extending beyond it both to the east and west. On the south  side, where all the domestic buildings of the Priory once stood, there  is a modern house and private grounds. All that belongs to the church is  a path running under the walls as far as the east corner of the  transept, where a garden door stops farther progress. Several glimpses  of the building, however, may be obtained on the way down to the Stour,  and seen from the south side of this river, the church rises above its  surroundings, and forms a conspicuous object. A good general view on the  north-east may also be obtained from a bridge over the Avon. From this  point of view the great length of the church is apparent; on the  right-hand side may be seen the ruins of the Norman keep of the castle  on its artificial mound, and nearer to the bridge the remains of a  twelfth-century Norman house. From the churchyard, also, the whole north  side of the church may be seen at once, and many striking features will  be noticed. Among these, the circular staircase attached to the  transept, with its rich diaper work; Norman arcading of interlacing  arches running round the transept; the large windows of the choir  clerestory, so wide and closely set together that the whole wall seems  as though composed of glass--through which, and the windows of the  opposite wall, the light of the sky can be seen; and lastly, the upper  storey of the Lady Chapel with its row of windows of a domestic type.    [Illustration: CHRISTCHURCH PRIORY, FROM THE NORTH-EAST.]    [Illustration: TOWER DOOR.]    A systematic examination of the exterior may best be begun with  the #Western Tower#. This is of fifteenth-century date, and is set  partially within the church--that is to say, its builder did not add  it to the west of the church, making an archway through the previously  existing west front, but pulled down the whole west wall of the nave,  leaving, however, the west walls of the aisles, and carried the north  and south walls of the new tower as far back into the church as the  space occupied by the western bay, thus leaving two spaces at the  west end of the aisles, one now used as a vestry, the other as a kind  of lumber-room. In the west face of the tower is a doorway under a  rectangular label; in the spandrels are two shields, bearing the arms of  the Priory, and of the Montacutes and Monthermers, Earls of Salisbury.  The doors are modern. Immediately above the doorway is a large window  with three tiers, each containing six lights. The head of the window  above these is of an ordinary Perpendicular character. The tracery was  restored in 1828. Above this window is a niche containing a figure of  Christ. The upper stage, which contains the bells, has two two-light  windows in each face, each light being divided by a transom. These  windows are not glazed, but are furnished with louvre-boards. The tower  is crowned with a pierced battlemented parapet having pinnacles at  the corners and at the middles of each side; within this rises a low  pyramidal roof. The stair turret runs up at the north-east angle of the  tower; this is octagonal, and is crowned with a parapet and crocketed  pinnacles; the upper part of this turret and the pinnacles were renewed  in 1871. The tower is strengthened by two buttresses at right angles  to each other at each of the two western angles. On either side of  the tower, as already explained, may be seen the west end of the nave  aisles; these have windows with Perpendicular tracery, and on the north  wall of the north aisle is a plain, round-headed doorway cut through the  wall in modern time, with a Perpendicular window over it.

But the raja Rituparna--great in wisdom as in might,      When nor king within the palace--nor king's son he could behold,      Nor of Swayembara heard he--nor assembled Brahmins saw.      Thus within his mind deep pondering--spoke of Kosala the lord.      \"Hither, O majestic Bhima--to salute thee am I come.\"      But king Bhima smiled in secret--as he thought within his mind,      \"What the cause of this far journey--of a hundred Yojanas.      Passing through so many cities--for this cause he set not forth;      For this cause of little moment--to our court he hath not come:      What the real cause, hereafter--haply I may chance to know.\"      After royal entertainment--then the king his guest dismissed:      \"Take then thy repose,\" thus said he--\"weary of thy journey, rest.\"      He refreshed, with courteous homage--of that courteous king took leave,      Ushered by the royal servants--to th' appointed chamber went:      There retired king Rituparna--with Varshneya in his suite.      Vahuca, meantime, the chariot--to the chariot-house had led,      There the coursers he unharnessed--skilfully he dressed them there,      And with gentle words caressed them--on the chariot seat sate down.        But the woeful Damayanti--when Bhangasuri she'd seen,      And the charioteer Varshneya--and the seeming Vahuca,      Thought within Vidarbha's princess--\"Whose was that fleet chariot's sound?      Such it seems as noble Nala's--yet no Nala do I see.      Hath the charioteer Varshneya--Nala's noble science learned?      Therefore did the thundering chariot--sound as driven by Nala's self?      Or may royal Rituparna--like the skilful Nala drive,      Therefore did the rolling chariot--seem as of Nishadha's king?\"      Thus when Damayanti pondered--in the silence of her soul,      Sent she then her beauteous handmaid--to that king her messenger.          BOOK XXII.          DAMAYANTI _spake_.        \"Go, Kesinia, go, enquire thou--who is yonder charioteer,      On the chariot seat reposing--all deformed, with arms so short?      Blessed maid, approach, and courteous--open thou thy bland discourse:      Undespis'd, ask thou thy question--and the truth let him reply.      Much and sorely do I doubt me--whether Nala it may be,      As my bosom's rapture augurs--as the gladness of my heart.      Speak thou, ere thou close the converse--even as good Parnada spake      And his answer, slender-waisted--undespis'd, remember thou.\"      Then to Vahuca departing--went that zealous messenger,      On the palace' loftiest terrace--Damayanti sate and gazed.        KESINIA _spake_.        \"Happy omen mark thy coming--I salute thee, king of men:      Of the princess Damayanti--hear, O lord of men, the speech:      'From what region came ye hither--with what purpose are ye come?'      Answer thou, as may beseem you--so Vidarbha's princess wills.\"        VAHUCA _spake_.        \"Soon a second Swayembara, heard the king of Kosala,      Damayanti holds: to-morrow--will it be, the Brahmin said:      Hearing this, with fleetest coursers--that a hundred yojanas' speed,      Set he forth, the wind less rapid,--and his charioteer am I.\"        KESINIA _spake_.        \"Who the third that journeys with you--who is he, and what his race?      Of what race art thou? this office--wherefore dost thou undertake!\"        VAHUCA _spake_.        \"'Tis the far-renowned Varshneya--Punyasloka's charioteer:      He, when Nala fled an exile--to Bhangasuri retired.      Skilful I in taming horses--and a famous charioteer.      Rituparna's chosen driver--dresser of his food am I.\"        KESINIA _spake_.        \"Knows the charioteer Varshneya--whither royal Nala went?      Of his fortune hath he told thee--Vahuca, what hath he said?\"        VAHUCA _spake_.        \"He of the unhappy Nala--safe the children borne away,      Wheresoe'er he would, departed--of king Nala knows he nought:      Nothing of Nishadha's raja--fair one! living man doth know.      Through the world, concealed, he wanders--having lost his proper form.      Only Nala's self of Nala--knows, and his own inward soul,      Of himself to living mortal--Nala will no sign betray.\"        KESINIA _spake_.        \"He that to Ayodhya's city--went, the holy Brahmin first,      Of his faithful wife these sayings--uttered once and once again;      'Whither went'st thou then, O gamester--half my garment severing off;      Leaving her within the forest--all forsaken, thy belov'd?      Even as thou commanded'st, sits she--sadly waiting thy return,      Day and night, consumed with sorrow--in her scant half garment clad.      O to her for ever weeping--in the extreme of her distress,      Grant thy pity, noble hero--answer to her earnest prayer.'      Speak again the words thou uttered'st--words of comfort to her soul,      The renowned Vidarbha's princess--fain that speech would hear again,      When the Brahmin thus had spoken--what thou answered'st back to him,      That again Vidarbha's princess--in the self-same words would hear.\"        VRIHADASVA _spake_.        Of king Nala, by the handmaid--fair Kesinia thus addressed,      All the heart was wrung with sorrow--and the eyes o'erflowed with tears.      But his anguish still suppressing--inly though consumed, the king,      With a voice half choked with weeping--thus repeated his reply.      \"Even in the extreme of misery--noble women still preserve      Over their own selves the mastery--by their virtues winning heaven;      By their faithless lords abandoned--anger feel they not, e'en then;      In the breastplate of their virtue--noble women live unharmed.      By the wretched, by the senseless--by the lost to every joy,      She by such a lord forsaken--to resentment will not yield.      Against him, by hunger wasted--of his robe by birds despoiled,      Him consumed with utmost misery--still no wrath, the dark-hued feels;      Treated well, or ill-entreated--when her husband 'tis she sees,      Spoiled of bliss, bereft of kingdom--famine wasted, worn with woe.\"      In these words as spake king Nala--in the anguish of his heart,      Could he not refrain from weeping--his unwilling tears burst forth.      Then departing, fair Kesinia--told to Damayanti all,      All that Vahuca had spoken--all th' emotion he betrayed.          BOOK XXIII.          Hearing this, fair Damayanti--all abandoned to her grief.      Thinking still that he was Nala--to Kesinia spake again.      \"Go, Kesinia, go, examine--Vahuca, and all his acts,      Silent take thy stand beside him--and observe whate'er he does;      Nor, Kesinia, be there given him--fire his labours to assist:      Neither be there given him water--in thy haste, at his demand:      All, when thou hast well observed him--every act to me repeat,      Every act that more than mortal--seems in Vahuca, relate.\"      Thus addressed by Damayanti--straight Kesinia went again,      Of the tamer of the horses--every act observed, came back;      Every act as she had seen it--she to Damayanti told:      Every more than mortal wonder--that in Vahuca appeared.        KESINIA _spake_.        \"Very holy is he, never--mortal man, in all my life,      Have I seen, or have I heard of--Damayanti, like to him.      He drew near the lowly entrance--bowed not down his stately head;      On the instant, as it saw him--up th' expanding portal rose.      For the use of Rituparna--much and various viands came;[131]      Sent, as meet, by royal Bhima--and abundant animal food.      These to cleanse, with meet ablution--were capacious vessels brought;      As he looked on them, the vessels--stood, upon the instant, full.      Then, the meet ablutions over--Vahuca went forth, and took,      Of the withered grass a handful--held it upward to the sun:      On the instant, brightly blazing--shone the all-consuming fire.      Much I marvelled at the wonder--and in mute amazement stood;      Lo, a second greater marvel--sudden burst upon my sight!      He that blazing fire stood handling--yet unharmed, unburned, remained.      At his will flows forth the water--at his will it sinks again.      And another greater wonder--lady, did I there behold:      He the flowers which he had taken--gently moulded in his hands,      In his hands the flowers, so moulded--as with freshening life endued,      Blossomed out with richer fragrance--stood erect upon their stems:      All these marvels having noted--swiftly came I back to thee.\"        DAMAYANTI _spake_.        Damayanti when these wonders--of the king of men she heard,      Thought yet more king Nala present--thought her utmost wish achieved.      Deeming still her royal consort--in the form of Vahuca,      With a gentle voice and weeping--to Kesinia spake again:      \"Go, again, Kesinia, secret--and by Vahuca unseen,      Of those viands bring a portion--by his skilful hand prepared:\"      She to Vahuca approaching--unperceived stole soft away      Of the well-cooked meat a morsel--warm she bore it in her haste,      And to Damayanti gave it--fair Kesinia, undelayed.      Of the food prepared by Nala--well the flavour did she know;      Tasting it she shrieked in transport--\"Nala is yon charioteer.\"      Trying then a new emotion--of her mouth ablution made:[132]      She her pair of infant children--with Kesinia sent to him.      Soon as he young Indrasena--and her little brother saw,      Up he sprang, his arms wound round them--to his bosom folding both;      When he gazed upon the children--like the children of the gods,      All his heart o'erflowed with pity--and unwilling tears broke forth.      Yet Nishadha's lord perceiving--she his strong emotion marked,      From his hold released the children--to Kesinia"]]]
