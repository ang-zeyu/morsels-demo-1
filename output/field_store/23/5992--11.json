It would be a fine thing for me to be asking a  gentleman like you to put your hand to anything, now wouldn't it!\"    Evidently the idea amused the herder.    \"Why not?\" Mr. Clark asked seriously. \"I am used to putting my hand to  much hard work when I am at home. Everybody in this world works one way  or another. Some of us work with our heads, some with our hands; but so  long as it is all honest, helpful work and we do it the best we can, we  are all on equal footing, Sandy. Now if you were in my office in Boston  I might be teaching you kinds of work that would be new to you; here you  can teach me. Try and forget everything, and just consider me a person  who is interested in sheep and wants to learn about them. Let me join  Donald in helping all I can.\"    \"I'll take you at your word then, sir, since you urge me. I'm no denying  it will make matters simpler. There is enough to do--more than enough,  and extra help will be welcome. Luigi will be going down with the  ponies, I suppose, sir.\"    \"Yes, he is to take them back, and stay and aid Thornton at the ranch.\"    \"Then you will have a place to fill right away, Mr. Clark. Some of the  men who have been helping have gone down already, but I have kept Tobin  and a couple of the Mexicans. Still it is no so easy to protect so many  lambs from the coyotes. Lambing time is their great feasting season. A  coyote is a mean creature, sir. Yet despise 'em as you may you cannot  help admiring their cunning. There is no smarter animal alive than a  coyote!\"    \"Tell us about them.\"    Sandy dropped down on a rock beside Mr. Clark and Donald.    \"A coyote, as of course you know, is a wee bit wolf, about the size of a  fox, and there is no feed he enjoys so well as a young lamb. Coyotes  seem to know when the lambs come and they make ready to raid the flocks.  You'd think folks would be bright enough to catch 'em, but there ain't  wit enough in the world to get ahead of them. They're the cutest! The  tricks a coyote will invent, sir, pass belief. In spite of the fact this  pasture is fenced with coyote-proof wire the creatures manage to get  in--goodness only knows how.\"    \"Have they bothered you much, Sandy?\"    \"Have they! Haven't we built fires round the herd every night and  patrolled the whole distance, back and forth, until light? Luigi,  Bernardo, Carlos, and I have been on our feet from twilight until  sunrise, tramping like sentinels; yet with all our care we have lost six  lambs already. Six is not many when you consider the numbers some  herders lose, still it is just six too many. So you see if Luigi goes  down over the trail to-day with the ponies we can find work for you and  Donald to-night.\"    \"Oh, I think it will be great fun to patrol!\" cried Donald.    \"Think you so? Well, mayhap you will find it sport, since you haven't  been doing it night after night for two weeks, lad.\"    Donald regarded him good-naturedly.    \"There will be plenty of work waiting you by day, too,\" Sandy went on.  \"Just now we are busy inserting the flock mark in the ear of each  lamb--a metal button with a crescent on it. The next ranch to ours is  Anchor Ranch, and their herd is marked with an anchor, while down beyond  lies Star Ranch. It behooves us to keep close track of our herds and  mark them carefully. Then in addition to the marking we must dock the  tails of the lambs lest they become foul; and we must record every lamb.  We have a book where we enter the number of the mother and opposite it  the number of her lamb. That is the way we keep track of the breeds.\"    \"Why, I had no idea you had so many things to do, Sandy,\" said Donald.  \"It is almost as bad as taking the census.\"    \"It is, and it all has to be done correctly, too. You can look up in the  books the history of every sheep we have at Crescent Ranch. The pure  breed lambs have to be registered with the Breed Secretary, you know.\"    \"Sheep-raising seems to lead from one thing into another,\" reflected  Donald. \"In the East none of us ever think of all that the wool goes  through before it is made into clothes for us.\"    \"It is better than any story,\" was Sandy's reply. \"Herders get tired of  it sometimes, but I never do. Sheeping is in my blood, I reckon. What  with herding and trailing the flock, what with bears, and bob-cats, and  cougars, and coyotes--I dinna see how it would ever be dull.\"    \"That is because you love your work, Sandy,\" said Mr. Clark.    \"I do. Take me from the ranch, sir, and blindfold me even, and I verily  believe I'd find my way back again. Now a bit more about the coyotes. If  you are to be of help you must hear all I can tell you so that you will  know the better how to fight 'em. Sometimes they'll yelp like a dog and  trick you into thinking your own collies are in trouble; but do not  trust them. 'Twill be no collies but themselves that are barking. Again  they will cheat you into believing that they are far away, so gentle  will be their cry; that is to throw you off the track. Or they will bark  in two keys as if there were twice as many of them as there really are.  They are the canny ones! Then when you pick up your gun and go where you  think they are, they will no be there; 'twill be at a different spot  they are at work.\"    \"Well, Don,\" said Mr. Clark, \"I do not see but you and I have something  ahead of us. I am afraid we shall be of very little help, Sandy. Why,  one ought to be an expert to catch such a gamester as a coyote!\"    \"Then you're no grudging us the loss of six lambs, Mr. Clark.\"    \"I do not see how you did so well--to lose only six in a great flock  like this!\"    \"But even so, sir, I was that wrathful when I found I had been outwitted  I could have cried. You see six or seven coyotes put their heads  together, as they have a way of doing, and cut a group of lambs off from  the herd--got between them and the flock. It took the dogs to drive 'em  away. Robin and the Prince are great fighters, and Colin is not far  behind. Before we got rid of them, though, we had lost three lambs. The  next time they tried a different trick: part of them barked and drew the  dogs to a corner of the pasture, and then the rest came down on the  unprotected end of the fold and carried away three more lambs.\"    \"Is there nothing that will stop them?\" asked Donald.    \"We have tried many things. Some herders put strychnine in the carcasses  of dead lambs and poison a few of the coyotes; most of them are too  clever to be caught that way, though. The government has also killed  many. Perhaps to-night, Don, you may have a share in the good work. But  I warn you do not send a bullet through one of my dogs, thinking his  barking is the yelp of one of these range thieves.\"    \"Indeed I'll be careful,\" Donald promised, as he sprang up and ran to  the edge of the rimrock to wave a good-bye to Luigi, who was  disappearing round a curve of the trail.    \"The lad is happy as a king here on the range, Sandy,\" Mr. Clark  remarked.    \"He takes to it as if he had been bred on the hills, sir.\"    \"I wish he might like the work well enough to go into the business with  me some time.\"    \"There is no telling. He is but young yet. When he is old as I, mayhap  he may choose to settle down and be a wool-grower.\"    \"How old are you, Sandy?\"    \"I should be near thirty, sir, I'm thinking, though I haven't always had  a birthday cake out here on the hills,\" was the whimsical reply.    \"Thirty! A rare age for such a level head as yours!\"    \"I dinna ken about the head, Mr. Clark. My father used to say it was the  heart that counted most. Now what say you to a basin of hot lentil  soup?\" inquired the Scotchman, changing the subject. \"You and Donald  must be hungry.\"    \"I believe we are. Let us go down to the tent. I see Donald there  already, building the fire.\"    After having eaten a hearty meal they left the flock which was resting  or grazing near by in charge of the dogs, and Mr. Clark, Donald, and the  men turned in to snatch a few hours' sleep in anticipation of the long  watch before them.    It was deep twilight when they awoke.    Sandy shook Donald by the shoulder.    \"We must be up and away, laddie,\" he said, as the boy turned drowsily.  \"It's a man's work--real work you're doing here; you are no playing  sheep-raiser. Rouse your father, snatch a bit of bread, and come and  help me set the watch-fires. See, the Mexicans are already ahead of us.\"    With quick step he was off.    \"Dinna forget your rifle,\" he called as he went.    Donald was on his feet.    \"Father,\" he shouted, \"Sandy says we must be starting out.\"    Mr. Clark sat up.    \"I promised to obey Sandy, sure enough,\" he yawned, \"and I like him all  the better for routing me out, sleepy though I am. I will be with you in  a moment. Where is Sandy?\"    \"Setting watch-fires along the outer edge of the pasture. He says to  bring your rifle.\"    A little later and they had overtaken the Scotchman, who was striding  along through the darkness, swinging his lantern.    \"It is here I'll station you, Mr. Clark,\" said Sandy simply. \"Patrol  this border as far as the bonfire; then turn backward and go until you  meet Bernardo. Donald will pace between the next two fires, and the  Mexicans and myself will complete the circle round the flock. Be careful  lest bob-cats steal down on you unawares; they come softly as mice, make  no fuss, and kill so quickly that they seldom disturb the herd. It is  likely we will no be troubled with them because of the fenced-in  pasture. Now cougars will leap the fence without the dogs knowing them  to be at hand, too, and will take their kill off over their shoulders  and disappear. We have seen no cougars, though, this year, and here's  hoping that we won't. While you are patrolling I'd advise you to fire  now and again, even though no beasts are in sight; it scares them off.  Now I've told you all I can. Good-night.\"    Away"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#13)"],[1,"  He said to those who kept the gate:  \"Haste, warders, to your master run,  And say that here stands Gadhi's son.\"      Soon as they heard the holy man,  To the king's chamber swift they ran  With minds disordered all, and spurred  To wildest zeal by what they heard.  On to the royal hall they sped,  There stood and lowly bowed the head,  And made the lord of men aware  That the great saint was waiting there.    The king with priest and peer arose  And ran the sage to meet,    As Indra from his palace goes  Lord Brahma's self to greet.  When glowing with celestial light  The pious hermit was in sight,  The king, whose mien his transport showed,  The honoured gift for guests bestowed.  Nor did the saint that gift despise,  Offered as holy texts advise;  He kindly asked the earth's great king  How all with him was prospering.  The son of Kusik(139) bade him tell  If all in town and field were well,  All well with friends, and kith and kin,  And royal treasure stored within:    \"Do all thy neighbours own thy sway?      Thy foes confess thee yet?    Dost thou continue still to pay      To Gods and men each debt?\"  Then he, of hermits first and best,  Vasishtha with a smile(140) addressed,  And asked him of his welfare too,  Showing him honour as was due.  Then with the sainted hermit all  Went joyous to the monarch's hall,  And sate them down by due degree,  Each one, of rank and dignity.  Joy filled the noble prince's breast  Who thus bespoke the honoured guest:  \"As amrit(141) by a mortal found,  As rain upon the thirsty ground,  As to an heirless man a son  Born to him of his precious one,  As gain of what we sorely miss,  As sudden dawn of mighty bliss,  So is thy coming here to me:  All welcome, mighty Saint, to thee.  What wish within thy heart hast thou?  If I can please thee, tell me how.  Hail, Saint, from whom all honours flow,  Worthy of all I can bestow.  Blest is my birth with fruit to-day,  Nor has my life been thrown away.  I see the best of Brahman race  And night to glorious morn gives place.  Thou, holy Sage, in days of old  Among the royal saints enrolled,  Didst, penance-glorified, within  The Brahman caste high station win.  'Tis meet and right in many a way  That I to thee should honour pay.  This seems a marvel to mine eyes:  All sin thy visit purifies;  And I by seeing thee, O Sage,  Have reaped the fruit of pilgrimage.  Then say what thou wouldst have me do,  That thou hast sought this interview.  Favoured by thee, my wish is still,  O Hermit, to perform thy will.  Nor needest thou at length explain  The object that thy heart would gain.  Without reserve I grant it now:  My deity, O Lord, art thou.\"      The glorious hermit, far renowned,  With highest fame and virtue crowned,  Rejoiced these modest words to hear  Delightful to the mind and ear.          Canto XXI. Visvamitra's Speech.      The hermit heard with high content  That speech so wondrous eloquent,  And while each hair with joy arose,(142)  He thus made answer at the close:  \"Good is thy speech O noble King,  And like thyself in everything.  So should their lips be wisdom-fraught  Whom kings begot, Vasishtha taught.  The favour which I came to seek  Thou grantest ere my tongue can speak.  But let my tale attention claim,  And hear the need for which I came.  O King, as Scripture texts allow,  A holy rite employs me now.  Two fiends who change their forms at will  Impede that rite with cursed skill.(143)  Oft when the task is nigh complete,  These worst of fiends my toil defeat,  Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o'er  The altar shed a stream of gore.  When thus the rite is mocked and stayed,  And all my pious hopes delayed,  Cast down in heart the spot I leave,  And spent with fruitless labour grieve.  Nor can I, checked by prudence, dare  Let loose my fury on them there:  The muttered curse, the threatening word,  In such a rite must ne'er be heard.  Thy grace the rite from check can free.  And yield the fruit I long to see.  Thy duty bids thee, King, defend  The suffering guest, the suppliant friend.  Give me thy son, thine eldest born,  Whom locks like raven's wings adorn.  That hero youth, the truly brave,  Of thee, O glorious King, I crave.  For he can lay those demons low  Who mar my rites and work me woe:  My power shall shield the youth from harm,  And heavenly might shall nerve his arm.  And on my champion will I shower  Unnumbered gifts of varied power,  Such gifts as shall ensure his fame  And spread through all the worlds his name.  Be sure those fiends can never stand  Before the might of Rama's hand,  And mid the best and bravest none  Can slay that pair but Raghu's son.  Entangled in the toils of Fate  Those sinners, proud and obstinate,  Are, in their fury overbold,  No match for Rama mighty-souled.  Nor let a father's breast give way  Too far to fond affection's sway.  Count thou the fiends already slain:  My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain.  I know the hero Rama well  In whom high thoughts and valour dwell;  So does Vasishtha, so do these  Engaged in long austerities.  If thou would do the righteous deed,  And win high fame, thy virtue's meed,  Fame that on earth shall last and live,  To me, great King, thy Rama give.  If to the words that I have said,  With Saint Vasishtha at their head  Thy holy men, O King, agree,  Then let thy Rama go with me.  Ten nights my sacrifice will last,  And ere the stated time be past  Those wicked fiends, those impious twain,  Must fall by wondrous Rama slain.  Let not the hours, I warn thee, fly,  Fixt for the rite, unheeded by;  Good luck have thou, O royal Chief,  Nor give thy heart to needless grief.\"      Thus in fair words with virtue fraught  The pious glorious saint besought.  But the good speech with poignant sting  Pierced ear and bosom of the king,  Who, stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear,  Fell prostrate and lay fainting there.          Canto XXII. Dasaratha's Speech.      His tortured senses all astray,  While the hapless monarch lay,  Then slowly gathering thought and strength  To Visvamitra spoke at length:  \"My son is but a child, I ween;  This year he will be just sixteen.  How is he fit for such emprise,  My darling with the lotus eyes?  A mighty army will I bring  That calls me master, lord, and king,  And with its countless squadrons fight  Against these rovers of the night.  My faithful heroes skilled to wield  The arms of war will take the field;  Their skill the demons' might may break:  Rama, my child, thou must not take.  I, even I, my bow in hand,  Will in the van of battle stand,  And, while my soul is left alive,  With the night-roaming demons strive.  Thy guarded sacrifice shall be  Completed, from all hindrance free.  Thither will I my journey make:  Rama, my child, thou must not take.  A boy unskilled, he knows not yet  The bounds to strength and weakness set.  No match is he for demon foes  Who magic arts to arms oppose.  O chief of saints, I have no power,  Of Rama reft, to live one hour:  Mine aged heart at once would break:  Rama, my child, thou must not take.  Nine thousand circling years have fled  With all their seasons o'er my head,  And as a hard-won boon, O sage,  These sons have come to cheer mine age.  My dearest love amid the four  Is he whom first his mother bore,  Still dearer for his virtues' sake:  Rama, my child, thou must not take.  But if, unmoved by all I say,  Thou needs must bear my son away,  Let me lead with him, I entreat,  A four-fold army(144) all complete.  What is the demons' might, O Sage?  Who are they? What their parentage?  What is their size? What beings lend  Their power to guard them and befriend?  How can my son their arts withstand?  Or I or all my armed band?  Tell me the whole that I may know  To meet in war each evil foe  Whom conscious might inspires with pride.\"      And Visvamitra thus replied:  \"Sprung from Pulastya's race there came  A giant known by Ravan's name.  Once favoured by the Eternal Sire  He plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,  For peerless power and might renowned,  By giant bands encompassed round.  Visravas for his sire they hold,  His brother is the Lord of Gold.  King of the giant hosts is he,  And worst of all in cruelty.  This Ravan's dread commands impel  Two demons who in might excel,  Maricha and Suvahu hight,  To trouble and impede the rite.\"      Then thus the king addressed the sage:  \"No power have I, my lord, to wage  War with this evil-minded foe;  Now pity on my darling show,  And upon me of hapless fate,  For thee as God I venerate.  Gods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth,(145)  The birds of air, the snakes of earth  Before the might of Ravan quail,  Much less can mortal man avail.  He draws, I hear, from out the breast  The valour of the mightiest.  No, ne'er can I with him contend,  Or with the forces he may send.  How can I then my darling lend,  Godlike, unskilled in battle? No,  I will not let my young child go.  Foes of thy rite, those mighty ones,  Sunda and Upasunda's sons,  Are fierce as Fate to overthrow:  I will not let my young child go.  Maricha and Suvahu fell  Are valiant and instructed well.  One of the twain I might attack.  With all my friends their lord to back.\"          Canto XXIII. Vasishtha's Speech.      While thus the hapless monarch spoke,  Paternal love his utterance broke.  Then words like these the saint returned,  And fury in his bosom burned:  \"Didst thou, O King, a promise make,  And wishest now thy word to break?  A son of Raghu's line should scorn  To fail in faith, a man forsworn.  But if thy soul can bear the shame  I will return e'en as I came.  Live with thy sons, and joy be thine,  False scion of Kakutstha's line.\"      As Visvamitra, mighty sage,  Was moved with this tempestuous rage,  Earth rocked and reeled throughout her frame,  And fear upon the Immortals came.  But Saint Vasishtha, wisest seer,  Observant of his vows austere,  Saw the whole world convulsed with dread,  And thus unto the monarch said:  \"Thou, born of old "]]]
