Mama, Mami.--Names of \"the lady of the gods,\" and creatress of the  seed of mankind, Aruru. Probably so called as the \"mother\" of all  things. Another name of this goddess is Ama, \"mother.\"    Mammitum, Mamitum, goddess of fate.    Mur, one of the names of Addu or Rammanu (Hadad or Rimmon).    Nana or Nanaa was the consort of Nebo at Borsippa, but appears as a  form of Istar, worshipped, with Anu her father, at Erech.    Nin-aha-kuku, a name of Ea or Aa and of his daughter as deity of the  rivers, and therefore of gardens and plantations, which were watered  by means of the small canals leading therefrom. As daughter of Ea,  this deity was also \"lady of the incantation.\"    Nin-azu, the consort of Eres-ki-gal, probably as \"lord physician.\" He  is probably to be identified with Nerigal.    Nin-igi-nagar-si, a name somewhat more doubtful as to its reading than  the others, designates Ea or Aa as \"the god of the carpenter.\" He  seems to have borne this as \"the great constructor of heaven\" or \"of  Anu.\"    Nin-mah, chief goddess of the temple E-mah in Babylon. Probably to be  identified with Aruru, and therefore with Zer-panitum.    Nin-sah, a deity whose name is conjectured to mean \"lord of the wild  boar.\" He seems to have been a god of war, and was identified with  Nirig or Enu-restu and Pap-sukal.    Nin-sirsir, Ea as the god of sailors.    Nin-sun, as pointed out by Jastrow, was probably the same as Istar or  Nana of Erech, where she had a shrine, with them, in E-anna, \"the  house of Anu.\" He renders her name \"the annihilating lady,\"[*]  \"appropriate for the consort of a sun-god,\" for such he regards  Lugal-banda her spouse. King Sin-gasid of Erech (about 3000 B.C.) refers  to her as his mother.    [*] This is due to the second element of the name having, with another      pronunciation, the meaning of \"to destroy.\"    Nun-urra.--Ea, as the god of potters.    Pap-sukal.--A name of Nin-sah as the \"divine messenger,\" who is also  described as god \"of decisions.\" Nin-sah would seem to have been one  of the names of Pap-sukal rather than the reverse.    Qarradu, \"strong,\" \"mighty,\" \"brave.\"--This word, which was formerly  translated \"warrior,\" is applied to several deities, among them being  Bel, Nergal, Nirig (Enu-restu), and Samas, the sun-god.    Ragimu and Ramimu, names of Rimmon or Hadad as \"the thunderer.\" The  second comes from the same root as Rammanu (Rimmon).    Suqamunu.--A deity regarded as \"lord of watercourses,\" probably the  artificial channels dug for the irrigation of fields.    Ura-gala, a name of Nerigal.    Uras, a name of Nirig, under which he was worshipped at Dailem, near  Babylon.    Zagaga, dialectic Zamama.--This deity, who was a god of war, was  identified with Nirig. One of this titles was /bel parakki/, \"lord of  the royal chamber,\" or \"throne-room.\"    Zaraqu or Zariqu.--As the root of this name means \"to sprinkle,\" he  was probably also a god of irrigation, and may have presided over  ceremonial purification. He is mentioned in names as the \"giver of  seed\" and \"giver of a name\" (i.e. offspring).    These are only a small proportion of the names found in the  inscriptions, but short as the list necessarily is, the nature, if not  the full composition, of the Babylonian pantheon will easily be  estimated therefrom.    It will be seen that besides the identifications of the deities of all  the local pantheons with each other, each divinity had almost as many  names as attributes and titles, hence their exceeding multiplicity. In  such an extensive pantheon, many of the gods composing it necessarily  overlap, and identification of each other, to which the faith, in its  primitive form, was a stranger, were inevitable. The tendency to  monotheism which this caused will be referred to later on.                        The gods and the heavenly bodies.    It has already been pointed out that, from the evidence of the  Babylonian syllabary, the deities of the Babylonians were not astral  in their origin, the only gods certainly originating in heavenly  bodies being the sun and the moon. This leads to the supposition that  the Babylonians, bearing these two deities in mind, may have asked  themselves why, if these two were represented by heavenly bodies, the  others should not be so represented also. Be this as it may, the other  deities of the pantheon were so represented, and the full planetary  scheme, as given by a bilingual list in the British Museum, was as  follows:      Aku             Sin             the moon        Sin    Bisebi          Samas           the sun         Samas    Dapinu          Umun-sig-ea     Jupiter         Merodach    Zib[*]          Dele-bat        Venus           Istar    Lu-lim          Lu-bat-sag-us   Saturn          Nirig (acc. to Jensen)    Bibbu           Lubat-gud       Mercury         Nebo    Simutu          Mustabarru      Mars            Nergal                      mutanu    All the above names of planets have the prefix of divinity, but in  other inscriptions the determinative prefix is that for \"star,\"  /kakkabu/.    [*] This is apparently a Sumerian dialectic form, the original word  having seemingly been Zig.                                  Moon and Sun.    Unfortunately, all the above identifications of the planets with the  deities in the fourth column are not certain, namely, those  corresponding with Saturn, Mercury, and Mars. With regard to the  others, however, there is no doubt whatever. The reason why the moon  is placed before the sun is that the sun, as already explained, was  regarded as his son. It was noteworthy also that the moon was  accredited with two other offspring, namely, Masu and Mastu--son and  daughter respectively. As /masu/ means \"twin,\" these names must  symbolise the two halves, or, as we say, \"quarters\" of the moon, who  were thus regarded, in Babylonian mythology, as his \"twin children.\"                               Jupiter and Saturn.    Concerning Jupiter, who is in the above called Dapinu (Semitic), and  Umun-sig-ea (Sumerian), it has already been noted that he was called  Nibiru--according to Jensen, Merodach as he who went about among the  stars \"pasturing\" them like sheep, as stated in the Babylonian story  of the Creation (or Bel and the Dragon). This is explained by him as  being due to the comparatively rapid and extensive path of Jupiter on  the ecliptic, and it would seem probable that the names of Saturn,  /Kaawanu/ and /Sag-us/ (the former, which is Semitic Babylonian,  meaning \"steadfast,\" or something similar, and the latter, in  Sumerian, \"head-firm\" or \"steadfast\"--\"phlegmatic\"), to all appearance  indicate in like manner the deliberation of his movements compared  with those of the planet dedicated to the king of the gods.                           Venus at sunrise and sunset.    A fragment of a tablet published in 1870 gives some interesting  particulars concerning the planet Venus, probably explaining some as  yet unknown mythological story concerning her. According to this, she  was a female at sunset, and a male at sunrise; Istar of Agade (Akad or  Akkad) at sunrise, and Istar of Erech at sunset: Istar of the stars at  sunrise, and the lady of the gods at sunset.                            And in the various months.    Istar was identified with Nin-si-anna in the first month of the year  (Nisan = March-April), with the star of the bow in Ab (August-September),  etc. In Sebat (January-February) she was the star of the  water-channel, Iku, which was Merodach's star in Sivan (May-June), and  in Marcheswan her star was Rabbu, which also belonged to Merodach in  the same month. It will thus be seen, that Babylonian astronomy is far  from being as clear as would be desired, but doubtless many  difficulties will disappear when further inscriptions are available.                         Stars identified with Merodach.    The same fragment gives the celestial names of Merodach for every  month of the year, from which it would appear, that the astrologers  called him Umun-sig-ea in Nisan (March-April), Dapinu in Tammuz  (June-July), Nibiru in Tisri (September-October), Sarru (the star  Regulus), in Tebet (December-January), etc. The first three are names  by which the planet Jupiter was known.    As for the planets and stars, so also for the constellations, which  are identified with many gods and divine beings, and probably contain  references, in their names and descriptions, to many legends. In the  sixth tablet of the Creation-series, it is related of Merodach that,  after creating the heavens and the stations for Anu, Bel, and Ae,      \"He built firmly the stations of the great gods--    Stars their likeness--he set up the /Lumali/,    He designated the year, he outlined the (heavenly) forms.    He set for the twelve months three stars each,    From the day when the year begins, . . . for signs.\"    As pointed out by Mr. Robert Brown, jr., who has made a study of these  things, the \"three stars\" for each month occur on one of the remains  of planispheres in the British Museum, and are completed by a tablet  which gives them in list-form, in one case with explanations. Until  these are properly identified, however, it will be impossible to  estimate their real value. The signs of the Zodiac, which are given by  another tablet, are of greater interest, as they are the originals of  those which are in use at the present time:--      Month                   Sign                                Equivalent      Nisan (Mar.-Apr.)

I cain't explain these queer whispers.  But I know  what I know.\"    \"Jorth has his followers.  You must have yours,\" replied Jean, tensely.    \"Shore, son, an' I can take my choice of the best men heah,\" replied  the rancher, with pride.  \"But I'll not do that.  I'll lay the deal  before them an' let them choose.  I reckon it 'll not be a long-winded  fight.  It 'll be short an bloody, after the way of Texans.  I'm  lookin' to you, Jean, to see that an Isbel is the last man!\"    \"My God--dad! is there no other way?  Think of my sister Ann--of my  brothers' wives--of--of other women!  Dad, these damned Texas feuds are  cruel, horrible!\" burst out Jean, in passionate protest.    \"Jean, would it be any easier for our women if we let these men shoot  us down in cold blood?\"    \"Oh no--no, I see, there's no hope of--of.... But, dad, I wasn't  thinkin' about myself.  I don't care.  Once started I'll--I'll be what  you bragged I was.  Only it's so hard to-to give in.\"    Jean leaned an arm against the side of the cabin and, bowing his face  over it, he surrendered to the irresistible contention within his  breast.  And as if with a wrench that strange inward hold broke. He let  down.  He went back.  Something that was boyish and hopeful--and in its  place slowly rose the dark tide of his inheritance, the savage instinct  of self-preservation bequeathed by his Indian mother, and the fierce,  feudal blood lust of his Texan father.    Then as he raised himself, gripped by a sickening coldness in his  breast, he remembered Ellen Jorth's face as she had gazed dreamily down  off the Rim--so soft, so different, with tremulous lips, sad, musing,  with far-seeing stare of dark eyes, peering into the unknown, the  instinct of life still unlived.  With confused vision and nameless pain  Jean thought of her.    \"Dad, it's hard on--the--the young folks,\" he said, bitterly.  \"The  sins of the father, you know.  An' the other side.  How about Jorth?  Has he any children?\"    What a curious gleam of surprise and conjecture Jean encountered in his  father's gaze!    \"He has a daughter.  Ellen Jorth.  Named after her mother.  The first  time I saw Ellen Jorth I thought she was a ghost of the girl I had  loved an' lost.  Sight of her was like a blade in my side.  But the  looks of her an' what she is--they don't gibe.  Old as I am, my  heart--Bah! Ellen Jorth is a damned hussy!\"    Jean Isbel went off alone into the cedars.  Surrender and resignation  to his father's creed should have ended his perplexity and worry. His  instant and burning resolve to be as his father had represented him  should have opened his mind to slow cunning, to the craft of the  Indian, to the development of hate.  But there seemed to be an  obstacle. A cloud in the way of vision.  A face limned on his memory.    Those damning words of his father's had been a shock--how little or  great he could not tell.  Was it only a day since he had met Ellen  Jorth?  What had made all the difference?  Suddenly like a breath the  fragrance of her hair came back to him.  Then the sweet coolness of her  lips!  Jean trembled.  He looked around him as if he were pursued or  surrounded by eyes, by instincts, by fears, by incomprehensible things.    \"Ahuh!  That must be what ails me,\" he muttered.  \"The look of her--an'  that kiss--they've gone hard me.  I should never have stopped to talk.  An' I'm to kill her father an' leave her to God knows what.\"    Something was wrong somewhere.  Jean absolutely forgot that within the  hour he had pledged his manhood, his life to a feud which could be  blotted out only in blood.  If he had understood himself he would have  realized that the pledge was no more thrilling and unintelligible in  its possibilities than this instinct which drew him irresistibly.    \"Ellen Jorth!  So--my dad calls her a damned hussy!  So--that explains  the--the way she acted--why she never hit me when I kissed her.  An'  her words, so easy an' cool-like.  Hussy?  That means she's bad--bad!  Scornful of me--maybe disappointed because my kiss was innocent! It  was, I swear.  An' all she said: 'Oh, I've been kissed before.'\"    Jean grew furious with himself for the spreading of a new sensation in  his breast that seemed now to ache.  Had he become infatuated, all in a  day, with this Ellen Jorth?  Was he jealous of the men who had the  privilege of her kisses?  No!  But his reply was hot with shame, with  uncertainty.  The thing that seemed wrong was outside of himself. A  blunder was no crime.  To be attracted by a pretty girl in the  woods--to yield to an impulse was no disgrace, nor wrong.  He had been  foolish over a girl before, though not to such a rash extent.  Ellen  Jorth had stuck in his consciousness, and with her a sense of regret.    Then swiftly rang his father's bitter words, the revealing: \"But the  looks of her an' what she is--they don't gibe!\"  In the import of these  words hid the meaning of the wrong that troubled him. Broodingly he  pondered over them.    \"The looks of her.  Yes, she was pretty.  But it didn't dawn on me at  first.  I--I was sort of excited.  I liked to look at her, but didn't  think.\"  And now consciously her face was called up, infinitely sweet  and more impelling for the deliberate memory.  Flash of brown skin,  smooth and clear; level gaze of dark, wide eyes, steady, bold,  unseeing; red curved lips, sad and sweet; her strong, clean, fine face  rose before Jean, eager and wistful one moment, softened by dreamy  musing thought, and the next stormily passionate, full of hate, full of  longing, but the more mysterious and beautiful.    \"She looks like that, but she's bad,\" concluded Jean, with bitter  finality.  \"I might have fallen in love with Ellen Jorth if--if she'd  been different.\"    But the conviction forced upon Jean did not dispel the haunting memory  of her face nor did it wholly silence the deep and stubborn voice of  his consciousness.  Later that afternoon he sought a moment with his  sister.    \"Ann, did you ever meet Ellen Jorth?\" he asked.    \"Yes, but not lately,\" replied Ann.    \"Well, I met her as I was ridin' along yesterday.  She was herdin'  sheep,\" went on Jean, rapidly.  \"I asked her to show me the way to the  Rim.  An' she walked with me a mile or so.  I can't say the meetin' was  not interestin', at least to me.... Will you tell me what you know  about her?\"    \"Sure, Jean,\" replied his sister, with her dark eyes fixed wonderingly  and kindly on his troubled face.  \"I've heard a great deal, but in this  Tonto Basin I don't believe all I hear.  What I know I'll tell you. I  first met Ellen Jorth two years ago.  We didn't know each other's names  then.  She was the prettiest girl I ever saw.  I liked her. She liked  me.  She seemed unhappy.  The next time we met was at a round-up.  There were other girls with me and they snubbed her. But I left them  and went around with her.  That snub cut her to the heart.  She was  lonely.  She had no friends.  She talked about herself--how she hated  the people, but loved Arizona.  She had nothin' fit to wear.  I didn't  need to be told that she'd been used to better things.  Just when it  looked as if we were goin' to be friends she told me who she was and  asked me my name.  I told her.  Jean, I couldn't have hurt her more if  I'd slapped her face.  She turned white.  She gasped.  And then she ran  off.  The last time I saw her was about a year ago.  I was ridin' a  short-cut trail to the ranch where a friend lived.  And I met Ellen  Jorth ridin' with a man I'd never seen.  The trail was overgrown and  shady.  They were ridin' close and didn't see me right off.  The man  had his arm round her. She pushed him away.  I saw her laugh.  Then he  got hold of her again and was kissin' her when his horse shied at sight  of mine.  They rode by me then.  Ellen Jorth held her head high and  never looked at me.\"    \"Ann, do you think she's a bad girl?\" demanded Jean, bluntly.    \"Bad?  Oh, Jean!\" exclaimed Ann, in surprise and embarrassment.    \"Dad said she was a damned hussy.\"    \"Jean, dad hates the Jorths.\"    \"Sister, I'm askin' you what you think of Ellen Jorth.  Would you be  friends with her if you could?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then you don't believe she's bad.\"    \"No.  Ellen Jorth is lonely, unhappy.  She has no mother.  She lives  alone among rough men.  Such a girl can't keep men from handlin' her  and kissin' her.  Maybe she's too free.  Maybe she's wild.  But she's  honest, Jean.  You can trust a woman to tell.  When she rode past me  that day her face was white and proud.  She was a Jorth and I was an  Isbel.  She hated herself--she hated me.  But no bad girl could look  like that.  She knows what's said of her all around the valley. But she  doesn't care.  She'd encourage gossip.\"    \"Thank you, Ann,\" replied Jean, huskily.  \"Please keep this--this  meetin' of mine with her all to yourself, won't you?\"    \"Why, Jean, of course I will.\"    Jean wandered away again, peculiarly grateful to Ann for reviving and  upholding something in him that seemed a wavering part of the best of  him--a chivalry that had demanded to be killed by judgment of a  righteous woman.  He was conscious of an uplift, a gladdening of his  spirit.  Yet the ache remained.  More than that, he found himself  plunged deeper into conjecture, doubt.  Had not the Ellen Jorth  incident ended?  He denied his father's indictment of her and accepted  the faith of his sister.  \"Reckon that's aboot all, as dad says,\" he  soliloquized.  Yet was that all?  He paced under the cedars. He watched  the sun set.  He listened to the coyotes.  He lingered there after the  call for supper; until out of the tumult of his conflicting emotions  and ponderings there evolved the staggering consciousness that he must  see Ellen Jorth again.        CHAPTER IV    Ellen Jorth hurried back into the forest, hotly resentful of the  accident that had thrown her in contact with an Isbel."]]]
