Sometimes the amusement is furnished by clever  amateurs among the guests, who may read, sing, or whistle, or what not.  In a circle where all are well acquainted, some of the pleasantest  evening parties are those to the success of which each one contributes  his mite, cheerfully singing in the chorus when nature has denied him a  solo voice, and not allowing any dark jealousy of superior gifts to  deprive the harmony of his one little note.    Invitations to these informal parties are cordial and personal in tone.  If the guest is expected to make preparation, in costume or to fill  some part on the programme, that fact is briefly stated.  For practical  suggestions, consult \"Parlor Games,\" adding any novel features that you  can devise.  A hostess with original ideas for entertainments is always  successful and popular.  Elderly people as well as the young enjoy  these parties; and they are a safe resource for mixed companies, when a  form of entertainment must be chosen that will please all and offend  none.    Children's parties, usually afternoon affairs, are often merely  childish \"good times\"; but again, they are conducted in close imitation  of an evening party for adults, and thus made a means of education in  the social ceremonial.  When sensibly managed, the children's party  affords a fine opportunity for training the little people in polite  manners.    When the children are almost grown up, but not \"out,\" pleasant little  parties for \"the younger set\" are given by the mothers, to accustom the  \"buds\" to conventionalities, and prepare the debutantes and their young  brothers to take their place gracefully in the larger social world.  These younger-set parties are like a grown-up party, except that they  are conspicuously chaperoned, and all responsibility is assumed by the  mothers and godmothers.    The two extreme phases of the evening party are the conventional ball,  and the rural \"sociable.\"    The special requirements for a ball are good music, and large  well-ventilated rooms, from which all superfluous furniture has been  removed.  For music, an orchestra of four or six pieces may be  sufficient.  For space, we must make the best of what we have, if the  ball is given at home.  This is practicable only where the rooms are  reasonably spacious.  Nowadays, a ball in a private house is rare, for  hotels, clubs, and first class caterers furnish charming ballrooms for  rental to exclusive patrons.    But whether in her own house or in a hired ballroom, the hostess is for  the time \"at home\"; and the general conduct of the ball is the same in  both cases.  Decorations, floral and otherwise, are important; and a  supper, served either during the progress, or at the close of the  dance--or both--is an indispensable feature.    The guests arrive at the hour designated, not earlier than nine  o'clock.  The hostess is stationed at some point near the entrance of  the drawing-room, where she remains during the evening to receive the  guests, who must pay their respects to her, first of all.  A gentleman  will also lose no time in finding his host, and paying him the courtesy  of a deferential greeting.    As the hostess cannot delegate her special duty of receiving, she has  usually several aids, young matrons, who keep a watchful eye upon the  dancing throng, and see to it that partners are not lacking for those  who might otherwise be overlooked; and in any way that the emergency  may suggest, or tact devise, they radiate the hospitality from its  centre--the hostess.    A gentleman in American society does not ask a lady to dance until he  has been introduced to her.  He may seek an introduction for this  purpose, or the hostess may request him to be introduced.  In either  case, the lady and the gentleman both cheerfully acquiesce.  A lady  usually accepts the invitation to dance, unless the dance is already  engaged.  She should be careful to inspect her tablets; and not promise  the same dance to two different partners, an awkward accident that  sometimes happens to a heedless belle.  After a dance, a gentleman  promenades with his partner, chats with her for awhile, and, finally,  with a graceful bow, leaves her once more in the care of her chaperone.    If a man has made an engagement to take a particular lady out to  supper, he must not forget himself and linger talking to another lady  until supper is fairly announced, since etiquette then requires him to  take out the lady with whom he is at the moment talking.  He should  seek the one he has chosen, some moments before, and leave the other  lady free to receive other invitations to supper.    Any gentleman who observes a lady who is not being served with  refreshments, should courteously offer to bring her something.  If he  is a total stranger he will attempt no conversation beyond the  civilities of the case; but these he will cordially though  unobtrusively offer.  The young man who does these little things with  the gentle grace of a knight errant, may not know that he is simply  charming, from a woman's standpoint; but the fact remains.    A ball, proper, is a strictly formal affair.  A dancing party, while  observing similar regulations on the dancing floor, may be, in the  social intervals between dances, as informal as a village \"sociable.\"  That is to say, as informal as the sociable ever _ought_ to be;  possibly not as informal as the sociable sometimes _is_.  People who  have \"grown up\" together, as villagers often have, are apt to consider  a life-long acquaintance the proper basis for unlimited off-hand  familiarity.  To a certain extent, and in a certain sense, such  acquaintance, being second in intimacy only to near relationship, does  warrant a cordial and trustful informality.  The cautious reserve that  marks one's conduct toward a recent acquaintance might justly be  resented by a tried and trusted friend of one's youth.  But even  relationship does not warrant undignified behavior, or rude liberties  of speech or action.  The boy and girl who went to school together grow  up to be the young man and woman of society; and while the memory of  school days is a bond of hearty friendliness between them, it is not  necessary that they should evince their mutual regard by a  free-and-easy demeanor.    Country sociables, attended largely by the younger members of families  long acquainted and associated, are apt to be rather rollicking, not to  say \"rough and tumble,\" affairs, where practical jokes and unmerciful  \"guying\" are the characteristic wit, and such smart tricks as bumping  an unsuspecting comrade's head against the wall are applauded with  shrieks of admiring laughter.  The onlookers may be excused for their  tacit countenance of the rudeness, since some element of drollery--that  might have been wit, under better conditions--compels a smile, in spite  of a dignified disapproval of the performance.  A young student, unused  to such scenes, standing a little apart from such a group once remarked  judicially to a lady near him, \"I do not care for such _dare-devil  sociability_.\"  Nor would other young people cherish it as their ideal  of a \"good time\" if they could learn how much more charming altogether  it is to exchange the delicate courtesies that make up refined social  companionship.  The difference in social culture is what distinguishes  the vulgar wag from the urban wit.  The crude humor of the former,  often marred by coarseness, is like ore in which the dross greatly  out-weighs the pure metal.  The brilliant _mots_ of the latter, refined  by the processes of culture, are like the gold nuggets separated from  their base surroundings.    How to eliminate the \"dare-devil\" from the sociability of country life,  without substituting an artificial stiffness, is the problem for every  thoughtful and refined man and woman in rural circles.  How to \"be  kindly affectioned one to another, in brotherly love, in honor  preferring one another\"--perhaps that would furnish the keynote of it  all, alike for the citizen and the rustic.          THE TWENTIETH CENTURY    The preceding chapters describe established customs in home  entertaining.  Such rules remain in force for the home conditions.    But who can live in this electric-motor age without noting the gradual  variation in \"the ways of doing things\"--changes that are directly  traceable to the influence of modern inventions?  The trolley lines  have brought large areas within the city limits; the swift automobile  has reduced miles to furlongs.  Town and country are intermingled as  never before, and each is sensibly modified by the other.  By its very  name, the \"Town and Country\" club recognizes this new community of  interests.  Its members, living even twenty miles away, outdo  Sheridan's ride, in arriving at the club on time for luncheon, golf, or  dinner.    Which brings to mind this fact: that to-day a large part of formal  entertaining in cities is no longer _at home_.  Elaborate dinners,  teas, and luncheons are given at one's club, or at _cafes_, exclusive  \"tea rooms,\" and in the elegantly appointed private dining-rooms now  provided by the best hotels.  After-theatre suppers are almost  invariably taken at a fashionable restaurant--doubtless greatly to the  relief of both the hostess and her housemaids.  While cooperative  housekeeping is still an undeveloped scheme, things seem to be trending  that way.    The multiplication of huge apartment houses (and diminutive apartments)  is the other prime factor in the case.  While the hotel dinner may have  come into fashion first as the dire necessity of the \"cliff dwellers,\"  its convenience appeals to many householders who formerly would not  have dreamed of offering their guests the hospitality of a _cafe_.  Many conservative people still deplore the innovation; but fashion "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#13)"],[1," to an old cupboard, she took  out a crust of bread. Then she drew the ragged curtains at the windows  and lit a candle. Simultaneously the entire attic was illuminated, for  stage candles have remarkable powers of diffusing light.    \"Why doesn't she pick up the flower?\" exclaimed Grace. \"If she doesn't  the scheme won't work at all.\"    \"I believe she's going to die,\" whispered Nora in a broken voice.    Just then the Irish comedian appeared, puffing and blowing from the long  climb he had had to the top of the house. He had come to bring help to  the dying girl, but he was funny in spite of the dreary tragedy, and  Nora changed her tears to laughter and began to giggle violently,  burying her face in her handkerchief in her effort to control her mirth.  Her laughter was always contagious, and presently her two friends were  giggling in chorus.    \"Do hush, Nora O'Malley!\" whispered Jessica nervously. \"You know that if  you once get us started we'll never stop.\"    A countryman, sitting back of Nora, touched her on the shoulder.    \"Be you laughing or crying, miss?\" he asked. \"It ain't a time for  laughing nor yet for crying, since the young lady ain't dead yet and I  don't believe she's goin' to die, either.\"    \"She just is,\" exclaimed Nora, wiping the tears from her eyes. \"She'll  die before she gets off that bed to-night, I'll wager anything.\"    All this while, the chrysanthemum with the note twisted and pinned to  its stem lay in the middle of the stage. In the meantime, Anne had  fallen into a stupor from cold and hunger. The kind little comedian  rushed about the stage, making a fire, putting on the tea kettle and  stumbling over his own feet in an effort to be useful.    \"Now, all the others will enter in a minute,\" whispered Grace  disgustedly, \"and she'll never get it at all.\"    Just then Anne turned on her pillow and opened her eyes. They looked  straight at David, who was sitting in the front of the box. He pointed  deliberately at the chrysanthemum.    \"She sees it,\" said Jessica, for Anne's eyes were now fixed on the  flower.    When the kind Irishman departed to spend his last cent on medicine and  food for the dying girl, she rose, staggered across the stage, seized  the chrysanthemum and rushed back again, just in time to be lying prone  when her father entered, now a repentant and sorrowful sinner.    \"It's all right,\" whispered Grace in a relieved tone. \"I feel sure that  the plan will work to perfection.\"    Anne _did_ die a stage death, and there was not a dry eye in the house  when she forgave her father, bade farewell to the entire company, who  had now gathered in the attic, and her soul passed out to soft music  while the lights were turned very low.    \"Fire! Fire!\" rang out a voice from the darkened house.    Where did the voice come from? Nora and Jessica were so startled they  could only clutch each other and wonder, while Grace whispered:    \"Don't move from your seats.\"    \"Grace, was that your voice?\" whispered David, who had joined the girls  during the death-bed scene.    But Grace made no reply. She only put her finger to her lips as she held  his arm with a detaining hand.    There was a panic in the house. The audience rushed for the doors while  the actors leaped over the footlights in their mad scramble to escape.  Several women's voices took up the cry of fire and the place was in wild  confusion. Evidently the man who managed the lights had been too  frightened to turn them on again, for the theater still remained in  semi-darkness.    The four young people did not move while the audience was crowding out  of the aisles.    \"We might as well be suffocated as crushed,\" observed David. \"It's a  much more comfortable death, and besides I can't smell any smoke.\"    Grace smiled but was silent.    \"I'm here at last,\" announced Anne's well-known voice behind them.    And there she was, still in her ragged stage dress, carrying her hat and  coat on her arm.    \"Why, Anne Pierson!\" cried Nora, \"I thought you were dead and gone.\"    Anne laughed.    \"Not dead,\" she said. \"But I would certainly have been gone in another  half hour. We needn't hurry,\" she continued. \"I don't believe he would  ever think of looking for me inside the theater, and, for the time  being, this is the safest place.\"    \"Anne, why did you never tell us you were an actress!\" demanded David.    \"I was afraid to,\" faltered the girl. \"I was afraid you would all hate  me if you knew the truth. Besides, I never acted but six months in all  my life. We toured in this play a year ago, and I knew the part  perfectly. It would have been cruel of me not to have played to-night.  The girl who usually does it was sick and there was no one to take her  part. When father told me that, I knew I should have to do it this once,  but if the fire panic hadn't started I couldn't have gotten away from  him very easily. He would have made a terrible scene. And even then, it  might have been difficult. No stranger would have helped me run away  from my own father, who is determined that I shall go on the stage. He  thinks I have the making of an actress. But I don't like the stage life.  It is hard and ugly. I want to study, and be with girls like you.\" A  charming smile radiated her small, intelligent face.    \"Where do I come in?\" asked David, looking at her.    \"I think you are the best friend I have in the world, David,\" declared  Anne. \"I can never forget your kindness.\"    \"And now, Mademoiselle Annette Piersonelli,\" asked David, secretly much  pleased at the girl's earnestness, \"can't you divest yourself of your  ragged dress before we go?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" she replied. \"I am fully clothed underneath.\" She slipped  off the stage dress and put on her hat and coat.    Meanwhile, not a soul was left in the theater except two of the ushers,  who were sniffing around trying to find out where the fire scare had  originated.    \"There comes father,\" whispered Anne. \"Can't we hide behind the seats?\"    \"Quick,\" cautioned David. \"He's coming down the center aisle.\"    The five young people crouched low while the actor stalked down the  aisle. But it was plain he was not looking for his daughter in the  theater, for he called out to one of the ushers moving about at a  distance:    \"Have you seen anything of the young girl who was with the company? I  lost her during the panic and I haven't been able to locate her since. I  must be leaving town in a few minutes,\" he added, consulting his watch.  \"It's almost time for the train now.\"    \"The company all left with the audience,\" said the usher. \"I guess she  went along with 'em.\"    \"Now is our time,\" said Anne, when the actor had disappeared. \"Suppose  we go out the stage entrance and down that side street!\"    Whereupon she led the way back of the boxes and into the wings, followed  by her friends, who looked curiously about them at the unusual sight.    \"What a queer place,\" said Grace, \"and how smudgy the scenery looks! Are  these little places dressing rooms, Anne?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Anne. \"You see, it's all horrid when you are close. And  the life is worse--riding almost every day on smoky trains and spending  each night in a different place. The people are so different, too. I  would rather go to Oakdale High School,\" she exclaimed, \"than be the  greatest actress in the world.\"    They were standing in one of the larger dressing rooms while Anne  endeavored to wipe the powder and rouge from her face with a pocket  handkerchief.    A tall figure darkened the doorway, and in the glass Anne saw the  reflection of her father's face. Without a word, she ran to the open  window and jumped out on the fire escape. The others followed nimbly  after her. Mr. Pierson turned and rushed down the passage to the side  entrance.    \"Hurry, Anne!\" called David. \"He will meet you at the bottom if you  don't.\"    They climbed quickly down the ladder, almost treading on each other's  fingers in their haste, and in another moment they were running down an  alleyway.    \"Another narrow escape,\" cried Anne, when they were out of danger. \"How  shall I ever thank you, dear friends?\"    \"You have already discharged the debt, Anne, by letting us see you act,\"  answered Grace.    \"By the way, Grace,\" commanded David, \"own up now. It was you, wasn't  it, who started the fire panic?\"    \"I told you I wouldn't tell,\" answered Grace, \"and I never shall.\"    \"Anne, did she say anything about it in her note?\" asked Nora.    \"No,\" said Anne mysteriously, \"she never mentioned the word 'fire' at  all.\"    \"I feel certain it was you who called 'fire,' Grace,\" said Jessica.    \"I'll never, never tell,\" cried Grace teasingly; \"so you'll never, never  know.\"    She turned in at her own gate and to this day the mystery is still  unsolved.          CHAPTER XI    MRS. GRAY'S ADOPTED DAUGHTERS      After Mrs. Gray's luncheon party in honor of Grace and her three friends  a tiny little idea had implanted itself in her mind. As the weeks rolled  on, and Christmas holidays approached, it grew and spread into a real  plan which occupied her thoughts a considerable part of every day.    As a secretary Anne had turned out admirably. The only drawback was that  Mrs. Gray could not see enough of her. The lonesome old lady almost  lived on Anne's semi-weekly visits, but the girl was too busy to give  any more of her time to reading aloud or driving with her benefactor.    Finally Mrs. Gray took a bold step. She invited the four girls to meet  at another Sunday luncheon, and announced her intentions from the head  of the table.    \"My dear children,\" she said, \"you are aware that I am a very old  woman.\"    \"We are not aware of anything of the sort, Mrs. Gray,\" interrupted  Grace.    \"Nevertheless I am,\" pursued Mrs. Gray. \"A very old, lonesome person  with few pleasures. I have decided, therefore, to do an exceedingly  selfish thing, and give myself a real treat.\"    \"You deserve it if anyone in the world does, Mrs. Gray,\""]]]
