Running in that  fine, heavy sand was, however, horribly exhausting work, especially to  one whose only mode of taking exercise was to stump the lee side of the  quarter-deck during his watch, and I was soon so completely blown that,  with the best will in the world to hurry, I was brought to walking pace.  But before I had made twenty fathoms from my starting-point two more  shots rang out from the party by the boats, and a moment later one of  the boat guns began to speak.  I looked out over the river, striving to  discover what the disturbance was about, and thought I could dimly make  out several dark blurs on the faintly shimmering surface of the water,  which I conjectured must be canoes, but I could not be sure; meanwhile  my business was not with them, whatever they were, but with Nugent and  his party, from whom, as I struggled along, two more musket-shots  cracked out almost simultaneously.  Then, down by the river-side, a  second shot roared from a boat gun, and this time before the ringing  report of the piece died away I distinctly heard a crash followed by  loud shrieks and much splashing out somewhere on the surface of the  river.  A few seconds later, panting and gasping for breath, I staggered  up to a figure which I had made out standing upright and motionless on  the crest of the spit, and found it to be Nugent, with his drawn sword  tucked under his right arm while with both hands he held his night glass  to his eye.    \"Who goes there?\" he demanded sharply, wheeling round and seizing his  sword as he heard the noise of my panting behind him.    \"Friend!\"  I answered.  \"The sk---captain desires to know why you are  firing, out here, and whether you require any assistance.\"    \"Oh! is that Fortescue?  All right.  Just take my night glass, will you,  and sweep the face of the spit carefully at about two hundred yards  distance from here.  Then tell me if you can see anything,\" answered  Nugent.  \"And, if it comes to that, why are the others firing, down by  the boats?\"    \"Can't say for certain,\" I answered, as I took the proffered night glass  and raised it to my eye, \"but I believe some suspicious canoes or boats  have hove in sight, and they are just giving them a hint to keep their  distance.\"    \"Ah! just so,\" returned Nugent.  \"Now _we_ are firing because, although  we can't be absolutely certain in this darkness, we think that there is  a body of men out there who would be not altogether disinclined to rush  the camp, if we gave them the opportunity; so we are just potting at  them--or what we fancy to be them--whenever we get a clear enough sight  of them, just as a hint that we are awake.  But as to assistance--n-no,  I don't think we need any, at least not at present.  Should we do so,  later on, I will blow a blast on this whistle of mine.\"  And he produced  from his pocket a whistle possessing a particularly shrill and piercing  note, with which he had been wont to summon Cupid to the midshipmen's  berth aboard the _Psyche_, when that individual's presence had been  needed with especial urgency.    \"Well, d'ye see anything?\" he demanded, after I had been peering through  his glass for a full minute or more.    \"I am really not at all certain whether I do, or not,\" I answered, still  working away with the glass.  \"I thought, a moment or two ago, that I  caught sight of something in motion for an instant, but it is so  abominably dark, as you say, that--but stay a moment, what is that dark  mass out there stretching across the ridge?  I don't remember having  noticed anything there before nightfall.\"    \"Dark mass?\" reiterated Nugent; \"what dark mass d'ye mean?  There is  nothing out there, so far as I--\"    \"By Jingo! but there is, though, sir; I can see it myself now, wi' the  naked eye!\" exclaimed a seaman who was crouching in a sand pit a yard or  so distant from where Nugent and I were standing.  \"There, don't ye see  it, Mr Nugent, stretchin' athwart the back of the spit?  Why, I can  make it out quite distinctly.\"    \"Give me the glass,\" demanded Nugent, snatching the instrument from me  and applying it to his eye.  For some eight or ten seconds he peered  intently through the tube, then exclaimed excitedly--    \"Ah, now I have it.  Yes, by Jove, Fortescue, you are right, there _is_  something out there; and it looks like--like--ay, and it _is_, too--a  body of blacks creeping along toward us on their stomachs!  Why, there  must be hundreds of 'em, by the look of it; they reach right across the  spit!  Yes, we shall certainly want help, and plenty of it, to keep  those fellows at arm's length.  I thought it was only some twenty or  thirty when I first made them out.  Yes, cut away to the skipper,  Fortescue, as hard as you can pelt; tell him what you've seen; and say  that I shall be obliged if he will kindly send me as many men as he can  spare.  That disturbance down by the boats seems to have ceased, so he  ought to be able to send us a pretty strong reinforcement.\"    \"All right,\" I said; \"I'll tell him, and then comeback with the men.\"  And away I went back through the heavy sand at racing pace, and  delivered my message.    The captain listened patiently to my breathless and somewhat  disconnected story, and then turned to Mr Purchase, who was standing  close at hand, and said--    \"Mr Purchase, have the goodness to take the entire port watch, and go  out to Mr Nugent's assistance.  But do not allow your men to fire away  their ammunition recklessly, for we have very little of it.  Let no man  pull trigger until he is quite certain of hitting his mark.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir!\" answered Purchase.  \"Port watch, follow me.\"  And away he  and his following trudged into the darkness.  I was making to join them,  but the skipper happened, unfortunately, to see me, and called me back.    \"No, no, Mr Fortescue,\" he said; \"you and Mr Copplestone will please  remain with me.  I may want one or both of you to run messages for me  presently.\"    So we remained.  But I at once ranged up alongside Copplestone, for I  was anxious to hear the news from Marline, down by the boats.    \"Well, Tommy,\" I said, \"what was old Marline blazing away at?  Whatever  it was, he managed to hit it, for I heard the smash.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Copplestone.  \"But it was more a case of luck than of  good shooting, for it is as dark as a wolf's mouth.  Some of his men,  however, had eyes keen enough to see that there was a whole flotilla of  boats, or canoes, or something of that sort, hovering in the river and  manoeuvring in such a fashion as to lead to the suspicion that they had  designs upon our boats, so he dosed them with a few charges of grape,  which caused them to sheer off `one time,' as Cupid is wont to remark.  What was the row with Nugent?\"    \"Lot of niggers creeping along the spit on their stomachs toward him,\" I  answered.  \"Got some idea of rushing the camp for the sake of the  plunder in it, I expect.  But now that Mr Purchase and the port watch  have gone out to back him up I think we need not--hillo! that sounds  like business, though, and no mistake.\"    My ejaculation was caused by a sudden cracking off of some six or eight  muskets, one after the other, closely followed by a heavy if slightly  irregular volley, and the next instant the air seemed to become  positively vibrant with a perfect pandemonium of shrieks, howls, yells,  and shouts as of men engaged in close and desperate conflict.  The  skipper pricked up his ears and clapped his hand to his sword-hilt; then  he turned to where Tommy and I were standing close beside him.    \"Mr Copplestone,\" he said, \"take twenty men--the first you can pick--  and go with them to support Mr Marline, for I fancy he will need a  little help presently.  The rest of us are going out to support Mr  Purchase and Mr Nugent.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered Tommy.  He picked out the first twenty men he  could lay hands on and taarched them off to join Mr Marline's \"picnic,\"  as he expressed it, and the rest of us went off at the double to take  part in the scrimmage that was proceeding in the neighbourhood of the  sand pits.  And a very pretty scrimmage it was, if one might judge from  the tremendous medley of sounds that reached us from that direction.  The firing was now very irregular and intermittent, but there was plenty  of yelling and shrieking mingled, as we drew nearer to the scene of the  fray, with sounds of gasping as of men engaged in a tremendous struggle,  quick ejaculations, a running fire of forecastle imprecations, the  occasional sharp order of an officer to \"Rally here, lads!\" dull,  sickening thuds as of heavy blows crashing through yielding bones, and  here and there a groan, or a cry for water.  It was evident that the  fight had resolved itself into a desperate hand-to-hand struggle; and it  seemed to me that our lads were being hard put to it to hold their own.  But the worst feature of the whole affair, to my mind, was that the  darkness was so intense that it was almost impossible to distinguish  friend from foe.    We reached the scene of the struggle so much sooner than I had expected  that it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that our people were  being steadily forced back in the direction of the camp; and this I  afterwards found to be correct; but the appearance of the skipper with  his reinforcements soon put another face upon the matter.  It was  evident that the foe--consisting of some hundreds of negro savages had  been under the impression that they were fighting the entire strength of  the British, but when we came up they at once discovered their mistake,  which, with the knowledge that, for aught they could tell, there might  be further reinforcements waiting to take a hand in the game, somewhat  damped their courage.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#13)"],[1,"of particular modes of cognition, and they  are only \"confused intelligence.\" This intellectualist thesis is of  early date; it will be found in Herbart, who, by-the-by, gave it a  peculiar form, by causing the play of images to intervene in the  formation of the feelings. However, this particular point is of slight  Importance. The intellectualist theory is more vast than Herbartism;  it exists in all doctrines in which the characteristic difference  between thought and feeling is expunged and feeling is brought back to  thought. One of the clearest means of so doing consists in only seeing  in the feeling the fact of perceiving something. To perceive is, in  fact, the property of intelligence; to reason, to imagine, to judge,  to understand, is always, in a certain sense, to perceive. It has been  imagined that emotion is nothing else than a perception of a certain  kind, an intellectual act strictly comparable to the contemplation of  a landscape. Only, in the place of a landscape with placid features  you must put a storm, a cataclysm of nature; and, instead of supposing  this storm outside us, let it burst within us, let it reach us, not by  the outer senses of sight and condition, but by the inner senses. What  we then perceive will be an emotion.    Such is the theory that two authors--W. James and Lange--happened to  discover almost at the same time, Lange treating it as a physiologist  and W. James as a philosopher. Their theory, at first sight, appears  singular, like everything which runs counter to our mental habits. It  lays down that the symptoms which we all till now have considered as  the physiological consequence, the translation, and the distant  effects of the emotions, constitute their essential base. These  effects are: the expression of the physiognomy, the gesture, the cry,  and the speech; or the reflex action on the circulation, the pallor or  blushing, the heat mounting to the head, or the cold of the shiver  which passes over the body. Or it is the heart, which hastens or  slackens its beats, or makes them irregular, or enfeebles, or augments  them. Or the respiration, which changes its rhythm, or increases, or  is suspended. Or else it is the secretion of the saliva or of the  sweat, which flows in abundance or dries up. Or the muscular force,  which is increased or decays. Or the almost undefinable organic  troubles revealed to us by the singing in the ears, constriction of  the epigastrium, the jerks, the trembling, vertigo, or nausea--all  this collection of organic troubles which comes more or less  confusedly to our consciousness under the form of tactile, muscular,  thermal, and other sensations. Until now this category of phenomena  has been somewhat neglected, because we saw in it effects and  consequences of which the role in emotion itself seemed slight, since,  if they could have been suppressed, it was supposed that emotion would  still remain. The new theory commences by changing the order of  events. It places the physical symptoms of the emotions at the very  beginning, and considers them the direct effects of the external  excitant, which is expressed by this elegant formula: \"It used to be  said, 'I perceive a danger; I am frightened, I tremble.' Now we must  say, 'I tremble before a danger, first, and it is after having  trembled that I am frightened.'\" This is not a change in order only;  it is something much more serious. The change is directed to the  nature of emotion. It is considered to exist in the organic  derangements indicated above. These derangements are the basis of  emotion, its physical basis, and to be moved is to perceive them. Take  away from the consciousness this physical reflex, and emotion ceases.  It is no longer anything but an idea.    This theory has at least the merit of originality. It also pleases one  by its great clearness--an entirely intellectual clearness, we may  say; for it renders emotion comprehensible by enunciating it in terms  of cognition. It eliminates all difference which may exist between a  perception and an emotion. Emotion is no longer anything but a certain  kind of perception, the perception of the organic sensations.    This reduction, if admitted, would much facilitate the introduction of  emotion into our system, which, being founded on the distinction  between the consciousness and the object, is likewise an  intellectualist system. The definition of emotion, as it is taught by  W. James, seems expressly made for us who are seeking to resolve all  intellectual states into physical impressions accompanied by  consciousness.    By the side of emotion we may place, as demanding the same analytical  study, the feeling of effort. We ought to inquire with effort, as has  been done with emotion, what is the psychological nature of this  phenomenon; and in the same way that there exists an intellectualist  theory of the emotions, viz. that of James, who reduces all the  history of the emotions to intelligence, so there exists an  intellectualist theory of effort, which likewise tends to bring back,  all will to intelligence. It is again the same author, that true  genius, W. James, who has attempted this reduction. I do not know  whether he has taken into account the parallelism of the two theories,  but it is nevertheless evident. Effort, that basis of activity, that  state of consciousness which so many psychologists have described as  something _sui generis_, becomes to James a phenomenon of perception.  It is the perception of sensations proceeding from the muscles, the  tendons, the articulations, the skin, and from all the organs directly  or indirectly concerned in the execution of movement. To be conscious  of an effort would then be nothing else than to receive all these  centripetal sensations; and what proves this is, that the  consciousness of effort when most clearly manifested is accompanied by  some muscular energy, some strong contraction, or some respiratory  trouble, and yields if we render the respiration again regular and put  the muscles back into repose.    To my great regret I can state nothing very clear regarding these  problems. The attempt to intellectualise all psychical problems is  infinitely interesting, and leads to a fairly clear conception, by  which everything is explained by a mechanism reflected in a mirror,  which is the consciousness. But we remain perplexed, and we ask  ourselves whether this clearness of perception is not somewhat  artificial, whether affectivity, emotivity, tendency, will, are really  all reduced to perceptions, or whether they are not rather irreducible  elements which should be added to the consciousness. Does not, for  instance, desire represent a complement of the consciousness? Do not  desire and consciousness together represent a something which does not  belong to the physical domain and which forms the moral world? This  question I leave unanswered.          CHAPTER V    DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS--THE RELATION SUBJECT-OBJECT      After having separated from the consciousness that which it is not,  let us try to define what it is. This and the two following chapters  are devoted to this study.    A theory has often been maintained with regard to the consciousness;  namely, that it supposes a relation between two terms--a subject and  an object, and that it consists exactly in the feeling of this  relation. By subject is understood the something that has  consciousness; the object is the something of which we are conscious.  Every thought, we are told, implies subject and object, the  representer and the represented, the _sentiens_ and the _sensum_--the  one active, the other passive, the active acting on the passive, the  _ego_ opposed to the _non ego_.    This opinion is almost legitimised by current language. When speaking  of our states of consciousness, we generally say, \"I am conscious; it  is I who have consciousness,\" and we attribute to our I, to our Ego,  to our personality, the role of subject. But this is not a peremptory  argument in favour of the above opinion; it is only a presumption,  and, closely examined, this presumption seems very weak.    Hitherto, when analysing the part of mind, we have employed  non-committal terms: we have said that sensation implied  consciousness, and not that sensation implied something which is  conscious.[23] The difference may appear too subtle, but it is not; it  consists in taking from consciousness the notion of a subject being  conscious and replacing it by the very act of consciousness.    My description applies very exactly, I think, to the facts. When we  are engaged in a sensation, or when we perceive something, a  phenomenon occurs which simply consists in having consciousness of a  thing. If to this we add the idea of the subject, which has  consciousness, we distort the event. At the very moment when it is  taking place, it is not so complicated; we complicate it by adding to  it the work of reflection. It is reflection which constructs the  notion of the subject, and it is this which afterwards introduces this  construction into the states of consciousness; in this way the state  of consciousness, by receiving this notion of subject, acquires a  character of duality it did not previously possess. There are, in  short, two separate acts of consciousness, and one is made the subject  of the other. \"Primitively,\" says Rabier, \"there is neither  representative nor represented; there are sensations, representations,  facts of consciousness, and that is all. Nothing is more exact, in my  opinion, than this view of Condillac's:--that primitively, the  inanimate statue is entirely the sensation that it feels. To itself it  is all odour and all savour; it is nothing more, and this sensation  includes no duality for the consciousness. It is of an absolute  simplicity.\"    Two arguments may be advanced in favour of this opinion. The first is  one of logic. We have divided all knowledge into"]]]
