After we have lived with him for half  a century he becomes more real to us than most of our acquaintances in  the flesh. Roman literature is not without other great names to attract  the student; but these two must not be overlooked by the most general or  the most selective reader.    With Vergil the world always associates the still greater figure of one  who was proud to call him master--that of Dante. More than is true of  almost any other writer, his work is a compendium of the life of his  time. The \"Divine Comedy\" is first of all poetry, and poetry of the  loftiest order; but it is also an embodiment of the learning, the  philosophy, and the theology of his age. It mirrors at once the  greatness and the limitations of the medieval mind. Dante is not modern  in the sense that Horace is, though he is thrice as near to us in time.  Leigh Hunt said that his great poem ought to be called an infernal  tragedy; but that is true only of the Inferno; the spiritual atmosphere  clears as we follow his footsteps through the Purgatorio and the  Paradiso. Of all the masterpieces of human genius the \"Divine Comedy\" is  perhaps the one that asks the most self-surrender of the modern reader  and--shall I add?--that repays it most richly. Longfellow's marvelous  sonnet sequence, written while he was translating Dante, portrays at  once the spirit in which we should approach the reading of the \"Divine  Comedy\" and the wonders that we shall find there. It is a book that we  never can outgrow. To know it is to be made a citizen of the moral  universe.    In 1616, within ten days of each other, there passed from earth two men,  each the writer first thought of when his country's literature is  mentioned, and one of them the first writer in the world's literature.  Cervantes and Shakespeare very likely died in ignorance of each other's  work. Stoddard has depicted them in Paradise,        Where sweet Cervantes walks,        A smile on his grave face ...      Where, little seen but light,        The only Shakespeare is.    There is no injustice in saying that Shakespeare's nature included that  of Cervantes. Not so inclusive was Dante's; what his nature most lacked  we find in the author of \"Don Quixote.\" Yet personally they are equally  heroic figures, and, one an exile and the other a slave, both drained to  the dregs the cup of human suffering. Cervantes has several great  advantages over most of the world's classic writers: his masterpiece is  a work of humor; it is written in a simple and graceful style, at once  easy and winning; and it is written in prose, which, after all, does not  make so severe a cultural demand on the reader as poetry. For these very  reasons it cannot aspire to the highest rank, but what it loses in fame  it makes up in popularity. Though in a few passages it is not parlor  reading, \"Don Quixote\" is one of the cleanest of all the world's great  books. It is not merely technically clean, but clean-minded. It has the  form of a satire on chivalry, but its meaning goes much deeper. It is  really a satire on a more persistent weakness of the Spanish character,  visionary unrealism. We have this quality held up to ridicule in the  learned man and the ignorant man, for Sancho Panza is as much of an  unrealist as his master, only he is a groveling visionary while Don  Quixote is a soaring one. This, too, is a book that one does not  outgrow, but finds it a perpetually adequate commentary on his own  widening experience of men and their motives.    In regard to the supreme figure in literature, the least thing that we  can do is to read him, and, having read him, to read him again and to  keep his volumes next to our hands. We shall hardly read Shakespeare  without having the question of commentators come up; and surely  Shakespeare deserves all the attention that we can bestow upon him. But  the general reader should clearly distinguish between the two kinds of  commentary that have appeared regarding Shakespeare, the one having to  do with his text, his historical accuracy, and his use of words, the  other with his meaning. In Hudson's edition these two kinds of notes are  kept separate. Surely it is the thought of Shakespeare that we want, and  not the pedantry of minute scholarship regarding his material, useful as  that is in its place. The reader who has mastered Hudson's  introductions and has read Dowden's \"Shakspere: His Mind and Art\" or  Brandes's \"Critical Study\" will have all that he will ordinarily need in  the way of guidance. But remember that reading about Shakespeare is not  reading Shakespeare; _that_ means, for the time at least, self-surrender  to Shakespeare's leading. Shakespeare is perhaps the supreme example of  a man who found the world interesting. He may not be sympathetic with  evil, but he finds it so interesting that he makes us, for the time  being, take a fratricidal usurper like Hamlet's uncle, or a gross,  sponging braggart like Falstaff, at his own estimate. Shakespeare is  never shocked at anything that happens in the world; he knows the world  too well for that. He offends the Puritan in us by his indifference; he  is therefore probably the best kind of reading for Puritans. Shakespeare  is romantic in his literary methods, but in his portrayal of character  he is an unsurpassed realist. If life were all thought and achievement,  Shakespeare would be the last word in literature; but there is another  side, the side which the Puritan represents, with which Shakespeare is  but imperfectly sympathetic. His message accordingly needs to be  supplemented; and it is interesting that his great successor, the man  who still stands next to him in our literature, supplies that missing  strain. If we could take but one book with us into banishment, it would  be Shakespeare--thus proving Shakespeare's supremacy by Miss Peggy  Heath's principle of elimination; but if we could take two, that second,  I am frank to confess, would for me be Milton.    It is Milton's literary glory that he appeared in the second generation  following Spenser and Shakespeare--he was born in Shakespeare's  lifetime--and carried off the palm, which he still keeps, for the  greatest English poem. In spiritual kinship he is much nearer to Spenser  than to Shakespeare. Shakespeare hides behind his pages; his  personality makes no clear or at least ready impression upon us; but the  colossal personality of Milton towers above all his works. He is Milton,  the superman, and communion with him for the moment lifts us to  something like his own level. In this personal inspiration lies Milton's  greatest service to his readers. Over and above the poetic delights, of  which he is a master unsurpassed, is the inspiration that comes from the  man behind the poetry; or, to express the same thought in other words,  above the organ music of his verse sounds clear and far the trumpet call  of personality. Therefore Milton is destined to inspire generations by  which his theology and his justification of the ways of God to man are  swept into his own limbo of myth and delusion. Fortunately Milton's  verse is not appallingly great in amount. If we cannot hope to know it  all by heart, as Macaulay did, we can at least know it well enough to  recognize any quotation from it, and rich will be the furnishing of our  minds when we have made this true.    In our beadroll of the world's greatest writers I shall mention only one  more, Goethe. He is the modern man who touched life most widely,  penetratingly, and sanely. His long life came down so near to ours that  many of us have had friends who were in childhood or infancy his  contemporaries. It is fair to say that since his death the world has  moved much nearer to his mental attitude than it stood in his lifetime,  and one of the agencies that have wrought the change is the living force  of his own works, which led and still lead the thought of men. Goethe  may be called the ideal creative critic of life. He held up a mirror,  not to Nature, as Shakespeare did, but to society; and society can get  away from the image which it sees reflected there only by growing away  from it.    Here let us close our list, not because there are no other great writers  to choose from, but because it is long enough for our present purposes,  and because, from this point on, every addition is open to challenge. I  have intentionally pitched my counsel high; some of my readers may feel  like calling it a counsel of perfection; but according to my way of  thinking, no writer is too good for any of us to read. Moreover, I  honestly think the list interesting. It is not chiefly reading for  recreation, but for soul expansion, and it means intellectual effort.  Unless we wrestle with an author as Jacob did with the angel, we shall  not receive the highest blessing. But some one may plead that, while he  does not wish to read wholly for amusement, he is not in a condition,  either from training or circumstances, to engage in mental athletics. He  cannot apply himself to an author as he recognizes that the greatest  writers deserve; but he is willing to read with attention, and he should  like to feel that what he is reading is good literature. This is a  reasonable request, and, out of countless possible responses, I will  make one that I hope may prove both profitable and attractive.    Let us set out with the recognition of the fact that systematic reading  is far more profitable than desultory reading, even on the same literary  level. One excellent way to achieve system is to read by authors--to  make the author a study, in his writings and his life. To read  Hawthorne's \"House of the Seven Gables,\" for instance, is to drink from  a fountain of the purest spiritual delight; but we gain an additional  delight, even if of a lower kind, when we know something of Hawthorne's  life and his relations to the old town of Salem.
