One of the causes why we find so few people who appear       reasonable and agreeable in conversation, is, that there is       scarcely any one who does not think more of what he wishes to say,       than of replying exactly to what is said to him. The cleverest and       the most compliant think it enough to show an attentive air; while       we see in their eyes and in their mind a wandering from what is       said to them, and a hurry to return to what they wish to say,       instead of considering that it is a bad way to please or to       persuade others, to try so hard to please one's self, and that to       listen well is one of the greatest accomplishments we can have in       conversation.    If we are indignant at the maxims following, it is probably rather  because they are partly true than, because they are wholly false:--         No. 144. We are not fond of praising, and, without interest, we       never praise any one. Praise is a cunning flattery, hidden and       delicate, which, in different ways, pleases him who gives and him       who receives it. The one takes it as a reward for his merit: the       other gives it to show his equity and his discernment.         No. 146. We praise generally only to be praised.         No. 147. Few are wise enough to prefer wholesome blame to       treacherous praise.         No. 149. Disclaiming praise is a wish to be praised a second time.         No. 152. If we did not flatter ourselves, the flattery of others       could not hurt us.         No. 184. We acknowledge our faults in order to atone, by our       sincerity, for the harm they do us in the minds of others.         No. 199. The desire to appear able often prevents our becoming so.         No. 201. Whoever thinks he can do without the world, deceives       himself much; but whoever thinks the world cannot do without him,       deceives himself much more.    With the following, contrast Ruskin's noble paradox, that the soldier's  business, rightly conceived, is self-sacrifice; his ideal purpose being,  not to kill, but to be killed:--         No. 214. Valor, in private soldiers, is a perilous calling, which       they have taken to in order to gain their living.    Here is, perhaps, the most current of all La Rochefoucauld's maxims:--         No. 218. Hypocrisy is a homage which vice renders to virtue.    Of the foregoing maxim, it may justly be said, that its truth and point  depend upon the assumption, implicit, that there is such a thing as  virtue,--an assumption which the whole tenor of the \"Maxims,\" in  general, contradicts.    How incisive the following!--         No. 226. Too great eagerness to requite an obligation is a kind of       ingratitude.         No. 298. The gratitude of most men is only a secret desire to       receive greater favors.         No. 304. We often forgive those who bore us, but we cannot forgive       those whom we bore.         No. 318. Why should we have memory enough to retain even the       smallest particulars of what has happened to us, and yet not have       enough to remember how often we have told them to the same       individual?    The first following maxim satirizes both princes and courtiers. It might  be entitled, \"How to insult a prince, and not suffer for your  temerity\":--         No. 320. To praise princes for virtues they have not, is to insult       them with impunity.         No. 347. We find few sensible people, except those who are of our       way of thinking.         No. 409. We should often be ashamed of our best actions, if the       world saw the motives which cause them.         No. 424. We boast of faults the reverse of those we have: when we       are weak, we boast of being stubborn.    Here, at length, is a maxim that does not depress,--that animates you:--         No. 432. To praise noble actions heartily, is in some sort to take       part in them.    The following is much less exhilarating:--         No. 454. There are few instances in which we should make a bad       bargain, by giving up the good that is said of us, on condition       that nothing bad be said.    This, also:--         No. 458. Our enemies come nearer to the truth, in the opinions they       form of us, than we do ourselves.    Here is a celebrated maxim, vainly \"suppressed\" by the author, after  first publication:--         No. 583. In the adversity of our best friends, we always find       something which does not displease us.    Before La Rochefoucauld, Montaigne had said, \"Even in the midst of  compassion, we feel within us an unaccountable bitter-sweet titillation  of ill-natured pleasure in seeing another suffer;\" and Burke, after  both, wrote (in his \"Sublime and Beautiful\") with a heavier hand, \"I am  convinced that we have a degree of delight, and that no small one, in  the real misfortunes and pains of others.\"    La Rochefoucauld is not fairly cynical, more than is Montaigne. But, as  a man, he wins upon you less. His maxims are like hard and sharp  crystals, precipitated from the worldly wisdom blandly solute and dilute  in Montaigne.    The wise of this world reject the dogma of human depravity, as taught in  the Bible. They willingly accept it,--nay, accept it complacently,  hugging themselves for their own penetration,--as taught in the \"Maxims\"  of La Rochefoucauld.    * * *    Jean de La Bruyere is personally almost as little known as if he were an  ancient of the Greek or Roman world, surviving, like Juvenal, only in  his literary production. Bossuet got him employed to teach history to a  great duke, who became his patron, and settled a life-long annuity upon  him. He published his one book, the \"Characters,\" in 1687, was made  member of the French Academy in 1693, and died in 1696. That, in short,  is La Bruyere's biography.    His book is universally considered one of the most finished products of  the human mind. It is not a great work,--it lacks the unity and the  majesty of design necessary for that. It consists simply of detached  thoughts and observations on a variety of subjects. It shows the author  to have been a man of deep and wise reflection, but especially a  consummate master of style. The book is one to read in, rather than to  read. It is full of food to thought. The very beginning exhibits a  self-consciousness on the writer's part very different from that  spontaneous simplicity in which truly great books originate. La Bruyere  begins:--         Every thing has been said; and one comes too late, after more than       seven thousand years that there have been men, and men who have       thought.    La Bruyere has something to say, and that at length unusual for him, of  pulpit eloquence. We select a few specimen sentences:--         Christian eloquence has become a spectacle. That gospel sadness,       which is its soul, is no longer to be observed in it; its place is       supplied by advantages of facial expression, by inflexions of the       voice, by regularity of gesticulation, by choice of words, and by       long categories. The sacred word is no longer listened to       seriously; it is a kind of amusement, one among many; it is a game       in which there is rivalry, and in which there are those who lay       wagers.         Profane eloquence has been transferred, so to speak, from the       bar,... where it is no longer employed, to the pulpit, where it       ought not to be found.         Matches of eloquence are made at the very foot of the altar, and in       the presence of the mysteries. He who listens sits in judgment on       him who preaches, to condemn or to applaud, and is no more       converted by the discourse which he praises than by that which he       pronounces against. The orator pleases some, displeases others, and       has an understanding with all in one thing,--that as he does not       seek to render them better, so they do not think of becoming       better.    The almost cynical acerbity of the preceding is ostensibly relieved of  an obvious application to certain illustrious contemporary examples  among preachers by the following open allusion to Bossuet and  Bourdaloue:--         The Bishop of Meaux [Bossuet] and Father Bourdaloue make me think       of Demosthenes and Cicero. Both of them, masters of pulpit       eloquence, have had the fortune of great models; the one has made       bad critics, the other, bad imitators.    Here is a happy instance of La Bruyere's successful pains in redeeming a  commonplace sentiment by means of a striking form of expression; the  writer is disapproving the use of oaths in support of one's testimony:--         An honest man who says, Yes, or No, deserves to be believed; his       character swears for him.    Highly satiric in his quiet way, La Bruyere knew how to be. Witness the  following thrust at a contemporary author, not named by the satirist,  but, no doubt, recognized by the public of the time:--         He maintains that the ancients, however unequal and negligent they       may be, have fine traits; he points these out; and they are so fine       that they make his criticism readable.    How painstakingly, how self-consciously, La Bruyere did his literary  work, is evidenced by the following:--         A good author, and one who writes with care, often has the       experience of finding that the expression which he was a long time       in search of without reaching it, and which at length he has found,       is that which was the most simple, the most natural, and that       which, as it would seem, should have presented itself at first, and       without effort.    We feel that the quality of La Bruyere is such as to fit him for the  admiration and enjoyment of but a comparatively small class of readers.  He was somewhat over-exquisite. His art at times became  artifice--infinite labor of style to make commonplace thought seem  valuable by dint of perfect expression. We dismiss La Bruyere with a  single additional extract,--his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#13)"],[1,"near the settled districts.  Jacob  seizing Charley White's gun said that he knew we should soon fall in  with some more, and going on cautiously ahead he very soon fired, and  then shouted to us to give chase.  He had severely wounded but not  killed a large kangaroo; and the animal went leaping over the ground  with his long legs, leaving, however, a thick trace of blood behind him,  which showed that he could not run a long course.  This encouraged us to  follow with greater zeal, and we enjoyed it the more as we dashed  through the forest after having been shut up so many months in our  little vessel.  At last we got up close to the kangaroo, a huge fellow,  who turned round boldly to meet us.  My son John, being close to the  animal, was going to strike him with a stick, when Jacob Rawdon cried  out to him to beware, and he had just time to spring back as the animal  struck at him with the formidable claw of one of his hinder feet.  However, it was his last effort before the animal sank exhausted from  loss of blood to the ground.    Jacob told us that he had seen many a dog killed when rushing in on a  kangaroo standing at bay, by being ripped up, and that John had had a  narrow escape.  The countenance of the animal had so mild an expression  that we could scarcely believe that he could commit so much damage.    We at once set to work to cut him up, and then, each of us loaded with  the best parts selected by Jacob, we continued our journey.  We slept at  the cottage of a settler, who received us very kindly.  We feasted on  our kangaroo flesh, and were able to repay him with a portion of it.  The next night we camped out near a stream.  Jacob Rawdon shot a number  of parrots, which we roasted for supper.  The next morning we reached a  lightly timbered, undulating country, with a river running through it.  Rawdon stopped and looked round.    \"Here, Mr Biddulph, if you take my advice you will pitch your tent.  You have grass and water for sheep and cattle, and timber to build your  house, and barns, and fences, and to keep your fires burning.  What more  do you desire? the soil is good; you may grow corn and vegetables and  fruit-trees.  You think that we are now in a desert: in a few years you  will find yourself in the midst of civilisation.\"    I talked over the matter.  Jacob showed me that he was right, and the  boys agreed with him.  He understood surveying, and we measured out  roughly two thousand acres.  He told me that as a free settler I should  have no difficulty in obtaining a grant of it.  We soon fixed on a site  for a house--not far from the stream, but at a sufficient height to be  out of its influence when swollen by rains.  The stream ran into a  navigable river not far off, and from a neighbouring height we could see  it and the sea in the far distance.  Charley and John were highly  pleased with the country, and were eager to get back to Sydney to secure  the grant, lest any one else should make application.  Jacob laughed at  their eagerness.    \"It is a good big country, and there is room for all,\" he observed.    He was right.  A large part of half a century has passed since then, and  a steady stream of human beings has been setting in ever since, and  still there is room for all who come wishing to work.    John wanted Charley to stay and camp out with him while Jacob and I went  back; but to that Charley would not agree.  He did not like leaving me  to travel alone with a doubtful character such as Jacob, and he besides  wished, I have no doubt, to see Mary.  I, however, was very strongly  disposed to trust Jacob.    We got back to Sydney without any adventure, and found all well on  board.  The sheep had greatly improved in appearance.  I sold a ram and  four ewes for a price which fully covered all the charges of the voyage;  the rest of those I had brought I kept, that I might have a good stock  with which I might commence on my own property.  I at once also made  application for a grant of the land I had seen, and obtained it without  difficulty.  I got an excellent price for the whole of my cargo, and  soon found a purchaser for our little schooner.  She was to run between  Port Jackson and other ports, either opened or about to be opened, to  the north and south.  Altogether my speculation turned out a most  successful one.    I felt something like Noah coming out of the ark when I landed, for the  last time, with my wife and family and chattels and sheep; and having  selected a quiet place, we all knelt down and returned hearty thanks to  God for the protection He had afforded us during our passage across the  ocean.  We asked Him to guide and protect us for the future; and I am  very sure that He heard our prayers.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    BUSH-RANGERS.    Having bought a couple of horses at great cost, and a light waggon, or  dray rather, I stowed therein the most indispensable portion of our  goods and provisions.  The rest we stored, to fetch when we had got up a  cottage.  My wife and daughters insisted on walking, saying that they  weighed more than all the tea and sugar we should require for many  months, and they were sure it would be wise to take all the stores we  could carry.  The sheep were so tame that they did not require to be  driven, but followed the boys, who took especial charge of them, like  lambs.    Steadfast, the dog, ran alongside the horses, and Duchess, the cat, took  up her post on the top of the dray with the cocks and hens, and cages  containing the other birds.  Bob Hunt and Dick Nailor, having made up  their minds to quit the sea, speedily turned into sturdy draymen, though  they kept to their sailor's rig, and could not easily lay aside their  nautical expressions.  \"As the horses, or their immediate progenitors,  had, however, come across the sea, it was but natural that they should  understand them,\" observed Mark, when Dick shouted out occasionally,  \"Starboard Dobbin, lay the fore-topsail abaft, Bob;\" \"It's time to  shorten sail, and bring the ship to an anchor;\" or, \"Luff, lad, luff, or  you'll be into that tree on the lee bow.\"  Sometimes when the ground  looked rougher and more impracticable than usual, Dick would cry out,  \"Breakers ahead; we must haul our wind and see if we can't get round the  shoal; won't do to wreck the waggon out here, where shipwrights', I mean  blacksmiths', shops are pretty scarce, I fancy.\"    Notwithstanding the inexperience of our men, and our own also, indeed,  we got on wonderfully well.  We all gave our minds to the work, and thus  made amends for other deficiencies.  Rawdon proved a first-rate guide,  and by his knowledge and sagacity we avoided many of the difficulties  which might have impeded our progress.    Our boys and girls enjoyed the journey very much.  They especially liked  camping out at night, for the novelty of the thing, I suspect.  The  parrots and parroquets, and other gay-coloured birds, with which they  now made an intimate acquaintance, were a source of great interest.  The  girls were rather horrified when several were brought in shot by Charley  White and the boys.  Rawdon at once plucked them, and put them before  the fire to roast.  Pretty Polly pie soon became a favourite dish in our  establishment, as it was at that time in the houses of most settlers.  He also showed us how to make damper, a wheaten cake baked under the  ashes.  At first it seemed very doubtful how it would turn out, as we  saw the lump of dough placed in a hole, and then covered up with bits of  burning wood.    Our chief prize was a kangaroo.  The boys caught sight of the creature  as we were moving on, and gave chase.  Away he went, hopping along on  his hind legs, with his little front ones tucked up, just as some women  in cold weather hold their arms with their shawls drawn over their  shoulders.  Charley White, however, brought him down, and he soon shared  the fate of the parrots.  We pronounced the flesh not very inferior to  mutton, and more suited to our taste in a hot climate.  A good sportsman  need not starve in the fertile parts of Australia, but there is one  great necessary of life, of which he may find himself fearfully  deficient--that is, water.  We were obliged to make very irregular  stages, that we might camp near a stream or water hole; and explorers  dare not move from one source of supply till they have discovered a  fresh one, at which they and their animals may drink.    At length we reached the spot we had fixed on for a location, and of  which I had procured a grant.  I had to make certain arrangements before  I could get the assigned servants, or, in other words, the convicts who  would be required to carry on farming operations on a large scale.  I  was glad not to have them in the first instance, and we were so  strong-handed that we could do very well without them.    My wife and girls were delighted with the position of their new home.  We camped on a spot close to a situation which seemed the best suited  for our proposed house, on a gentle slope, with a hill covered with  trees behind it, and a stream some distance below us.  The spot was  pretty clear of wood, that is to say, just out of the bush, and there  was excellent pasture on either side for our sheep and for our cattle,  whenever we should obtain them.  They were not so plentiful as they now  are.    As soon as we had pitched our tent we all knelt down and returned thanks  to that merciful God who had brought us across the ocean into this  lovely haven of rest--so it seemed, for we thought not then of the  troubles before us.    What a privilege it is to be able to go direct to God in prayer, through  the sure mediation of the loving Jesus, pleading His perfect,  all-sufficient sacrifice--His precious blood shed for sinful man on  Calvary.  I felt it then: I have felt it ever since; and I would not  give up that privilege of prayer for anything else the world can bestow.  I have sometimes thought"]]]
