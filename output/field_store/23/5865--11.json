By means of it,  students in all countries are informed from year to year of the new  acquisitions and discoveries made by the staff of the Museum, or by  the leading authors and students of the subject, of all nationalities.  The Berlin collection has thus won for itself a place as the  historical collection _par excellence_.\"    The Museums are under the care of a Director-General, with nine or  more Directors of Departments. Dr. Julius Meyer, Director of the  Picture-Gallery, is said to be probably unequalled by any living  writer for a wide and philosophic grasp of the whole subject of Art  History, to which his life has been devoted; while the names of  distinguished scholars and professors at the head of the other  departments are guaranties of similar excellence. A series of four  illustrated volumes is now in process of publication, which will  present, in photographs and engravings, large or small, every picture  of importance in the gallery. The text of these volumes, by Drs. Meyer  and Bode, will be extremely valuable, and the whole will doubtless  stand foremost among publications designed as exponents of European  galleries.    The fine and massive building of the Arsenal, opposite the palace of  the late Crown Prince, dates from the time of Frederick I., last of  the Electors and first of the Prussian Kings. The grand sculptures of  the German artist Schlueter, who was afterwards called to the aid of  Peter the Great in the creation of St. Petersburg, adorn the exterior  of the edifice. Any chance walk along the Linden will arrest the  attention to this building, with the remarkable heads of dying  warriors carved in the keystones of its window arches. In the  renovation of the Arsenal a few years since, no improvement was made  on the exterior, except to remove the accumulations of smoke and dust  which a hundred and seventy years had deposited there. After the close  of the Franco-Prussian War, it was the thought of the aged Emperor to  make this Arsenal, already crowded with an immense collection of arms,  armor, and trophies, into a kind of Walhalla,--a National Hall of  Fame. This was fully carried out. In rooms on the ground floor one may  read the whole history of ordnance, old and new, including the famous  Armstrong and Krupp guns. A portion of this floor is devoted to models  of fortresses, plans of battles, and captured flags. There is a war  library; and the celebrated pictures of the Giant Grenadiers, painted  with his own hand by Frederick William I., father of Frederick the  Great, are also to be seen.    A magnificent double staircase under a glass roof leads to the second  floor (in Germany called the first), where one portion is devoted to  an interesting collection of arms, which is, however, inferior to  those of one or two other European cities. The chief attraction to the  visitor, as well as a permanent magnet to the patriotic Berlinese, who  come hither in whole families, is the \"Hall of Fame,\" consisting of  three sections, all splendid in mosaic floors and massive marble  pillars, and adorned with sculpture and fine historical frescos. One  of the latter represents the Coronation of the first King of Prussia  at Koenigsberg, and another has for its subject the Proclamation of the  German Empire at Versailles. The Central Hall is adorned with bronze  statues of the Great Elector, of the Fredericks and Frederick-Williams  of the Prussian royal line, and of the Emperor William I. The \"Halls  of the Generals,\" on either side of this \"Hall of the Rulers,\" have  busts of the military leaders, including a fine one of the Crown  Prince. Here are also several historical paintings; prominent among  which are \"The Battle of Turin,\" \"The Emperor William and the Crown  Prince at Koeniggraetz,\" and \"The Capitulation at Sedan.\"    Perhaps no collection, among many more which might be mentioned,  better illustrates the practical working of the German mind than the  Royal Post Museum in the Leipziger Strasse. Here is shown everything  of interest connected with the transmission of intelligence, and  poetry as well as prose has entered into the heart of this Government  exhibit. On the walls of the first saloon entered by the visitor are  copies in stone of Assyrian bas-reliefs showing a warrior with chariot  and arrows. This suggests to us a scene in the lives of David and  Jonathan; but communication by means of arrows is probably much older  than the time of David. Earlier than even the Assyrian stone must have  been the model for the Egyptian wicker and wooden post-chariot. In  this room, under a glass case, is an exquisite marble statuette, found  at Tanagra, of a Grecian girl seated, and writing on a tablet; and not  far away is a Roman warrior, carrying his message. Entering the next  hall, we pass a beautiful bronze statue of Philip, the Grecian  soldier, bearing a laurel spray, stretching his athletic limbs in  breathless strides as he goes toward the capital to announce the  battle of Marathon, and to fall dead on his entrance to the city, with  the single word \"Victory!\" on his lips. Here on the walls are four  emblematic pictures: \"The Land-Post,\" representing a knight with a  sealed missive in his hand, standing beside and curbing his fiery  steeds; \"The Sea-Post,\" showing a mail-carrier on the back of a  dolphin in the midst of stormy waves far out at sea; \"The Telegraph,\"  with Jove and his lightnings as its central figure: and \"The  _Rohrpost_,\"--a maiden, blowing into an orifice with \"the breath of  all the winds.\" This last is emblematic of that postal arrangement in  Berlin by which letters and postal cards are sent with great speed  through pneumatic tubes from which the air is exhausted by means of  pumps, and which makes it possible to receive a written message from a  distant part of the city within a few minutes after it is written.    Among the ancient representations are models of the boats in which the  old Norsemen sailed the seas, and of those by which our Anglo-Saxon  ancestors invaded England from Germany. These are strikingly  contrasted, in their simplicity and clumsiness, with a fully equipped  model, from four to six feet long, of a modern North German Lloyd  Atlantic mail steamship, than which no better equipped boat sails the  main. One goes on, past a Gobelin tapestry representing a mail-scene  at Nueremberg in the Middle Ages, through long halls and corridors  where are hundreds of models of post-office buildings of the most  convenient and approved plans, in all parts of the world. These are of  every variety of architecture, from the great general post-office in  London, the handsome Hanover post-office building, those of the  central and district post-offices in Berlin, Dresden, Cologne,  Heidelberg, and many others in South Germany, to the modern edifices  which adorn, and yet seem strangely out of keeping with, the  picturesque old North German towns. These models are miniature copies  of the exteriors of post-office buildings, varying in length from one  and a half to six or eight feet, and of corresponding height. One most  interesting model shows the interior of a modern post-office, each  floor showing an exact copy of its department of the service, with  all appliances and conveniences.    In another room are miniature mail-coaches of different kinds. In the  centre of this apartment stands a life-size figure of a mail-carrier  in Germany of four hundred years ago. He is a wild-looking official,  reminding one by his bronzed features and general appearance of some  trusty Indian scout, as he holds his gun in an attitude of suspicion  and menace, while a bear-cub opens a capacious mouth at his feet.    Model mail and post-office cars occupy the side of another large room;  but this exhibit is so vast and varied that the memory refuses to  retain its classification, and holds side by side Alaskan sledges  drawn by dogs, Russian post-chaises with reindeer teams, mail-boats on  Norwegian fiords, carrier-pigeons and balloons, camels and elephants,  and the model mail-coach of the lightning express of the New York  Central Railroad. The working appliance used in America for catching  off a mail-bag without stopping the train attracts much attention.  There is a complete set of the weights and measures used in British  post-offices, and two glass cases show the forms of horseshoes best  adapted to the speed of horses carrying mails. Tablets, pens, and  pencils have cases to themselves, as well as parchments, ancient rolls  and ink-horns, reeds and papyrus. Here are the primitive postal  arrangements of some of the East Indies; there is the yellow satin  missive with a scarlet seal which carries the royal mandates of Siam.  Pictures and models of mail-carrying elephants come next, their gay  saddle-cloths filled with pockets and parchment rolls. A model of a  Japanese post-office is finished in all its interior with the  perfection of detail and delicacy of execution which characterize the  best Japanese work. A framed engraving of the International Postal  Congress at Berne in 1874 hangs near one of the Congress at Paris in  1878. There is a room devoted to the exhibition of postal stamps,  cards, and envelopes of every kind, and there are several rooms where  models of the most approved kinds of telegraphic apparatus are shown.  In a corridor are all varieties of submarine cables, with the ore and  the Bessemer steel of which they are spun. In one of the rooms a small  crowd is collected about an operator who speaks through a telephone,  records the sound of his own voice on strips of foil, which he tears  into fragments and distributes to those who eagerly reach for them. In  the centre of this room there is a tiny circular railway, with a  coach, but no locomotive, standing on the track.

We're living at  the top of a wave at present!\"    \"I remember,\" said Carmel, \"when Mother and Daddy took me to Rome, we  saw the busts of the Emperors, and of all sorts of clever people, who'd  lived in about the first century, and we all said: 'Oh, aren't their  faces just like people of to-day?' We amused ourselves with saying one  was a lawyer, and another a doctor, and calling some of them after our  friends. Then we went afterwards to an exhibition of sixteenth-century  portraits; perhaps the artists hadn't learnt to paint well, but at any  rate the faces were utterly different from people of to-day. They seemed  quite another type altogether--not so intelligent or so interesting. We  were tremendously struck with the difference.\"    \"It marks my point,\" said Miss Adams.    \"What else do Gorgo and Praxinoe do?\" asked Edith.    \"They go into Alexandria for the festival, and find the streets so  crowded that they are almost frightened to death, and have hard work not  to lose Eunoe, the slave girl, whom they have taken with them; she  nearly gets squeezed as they pass in at the door. They go into raptures  over an exhibition of embroideries. 'Lady Athene,' says Praxinoe, 'what  spinning-women wrought them? What painters designed their drawings, so  true they are?' I haven't time to read it all to you now, but I must  just give you the little bit where they quarrel with a stranger. It's  too absolutely priceless.        \"_A Stranger._ You weariful women, do cease your endless cooing talk!       You bore one to death with your eternal broad vowels!        \"_Gorgo._ Indeed! And where may this person come from? What is it to       you if we _are_ chatterboxes? Give orders to your own servants,       sir. Do you pretend to command ladies of Syracuse? If you must       know, we are Corinthians by descent, like Bellerophon himself, and       we speak Peloponnesian. Dorian women may lawfully speak Doric, I       presume?\"    \"Oh, _do_ let me be Gorgo!\" begged Dulcie. \"I love her; she's so smart  and sarcastic. Isn't it exactly like somebody talking during a concert,  and a person in the row in front objecting, and a friend butting in with  rude remarks? That's what generally happens.\"    \"Did people's accent matter in Greek as much as it does in English?\"  asked Prissie.    \"Evidently. The Alexandrian gentleman--who sounds a decided fop--did not  approve of a Doric pronunciation. No doubt broad vowels were out of  fashion. I believe I shall give his part to Edith. It's a small one,  but it has scope for a good deal of acting.\"    \"And who is to be Praxinoe, please?\"    \"I think I must choose Carmel. She ought to act in an idyll by  Theocritus, as he was a Sicilian like herself. Would he find Sicily much  altered, Carmel, if he came back? Or is it the same after two thousand  years?\"    \"There are still goatherds on the mountains, though we don't see wood  nymphs now!\"    \"No, the wood nymphs have all trotted over to England, and are going to  give a performance in aid of the 'Waifs and Strays!'\" said Dulcie. \"I  hope Apollo will remember them, and send them a fine day, if he's  anything to do with the weather over here. Perhaps his sun chariot only  runs on the Mediterranean route.\"    \"Surely he's got an aeroplane by now!\" laughed Edith. \"We'll send him a  wireless message to remind him of his duty. 'Nymphs dancing Thursday  week at 2.30 P. M. Kindly cable special supply of sunshine.'\"    \"Now, girls, you're getting silly!\" said Miss Adams, shutting her book  and rising. \"If we want to make a success of our classic afternoon,  we've plenty of hard work before us. I'm going on with costumes at  present, and anybody who cares to volunteer can fetch her thimble and a  needle and cotton, and hem a chiton.\"          CHAPTER VIII    Wood Nymphs      It needed a tremendous amount of rehearsing and preparation before Miss  Adams judged her classic performance fit for public exhibition. The  Greek garments, simple as they were, nevertheless required sewing, and  there were certain pieces of scenery to be constructed. The other  mistresses helped nobly, though they were thankful to be spared the  organization of the proceedings, and to leave the brunt of the burden to  a specialist. Tickets for the entertainment had been sold in the  neighborhood, and parents and friends of the girls who lived within  motoring distance had promised to drive over.    \"Cousin Clare is coming!\" rejoiced Dulcie. \"She has two friends staying  at the Chase, and she'll bring them with her. If Milner drives them, I  shall ask Miss Walters if he may come and watch too. He'd be _so_  delighted to see it. He loves anything of that kind. His own little girl  was May Queen at the village pageant two years ago, and he's talked  about it ever since.\"    \"I wrote to Mr. Bowden,\" said Lilias, \"and he's taken two tickets, but  he's doubtful if he'll find time to get off. He's always so busy.\"    \"Never mind if he sent the money for them!\" consoled Edith. \"Of course  it's nice to have big audiences, but it's money we're out for. We want  to make a decent sum.\"    \"Miss Walters says the tickets have sold quite well. Even if it's a  doubtful day, and we don't have a very big audience, we shall clear  something, at any rate.\"    \"Oh, but I do hope people will come! It's so disappointing to take all  this trouble, and to act to rows of empty chairs. What's going to  happen, by the by, if it's a wet day? Will it be put off?\"    \"We shall have to have it in the big schoolroom. It can't be put off,  because Miss Adams can only stay till Friday, and we couldn't get  through it without her.\"    \"No, indeed! She's the directing genius of it all!\"    \"Oh dear! It simply _must_ keep fine!\"    Never was weather more carefully watched. All the old country saws and  superstitions were remembered and repeated. It became a matter of vital  importance to notice whether the scarlet pimpernel was out, if the  cattle were grazing with their heads up hill, and whether a heron flew  across the sky. Prissie took a candle into the garden last thing before  bed-time, to observe if the lawn showed earthworms; the finding of black  slugs was considered to be rather fatal, and the hooting of owls a  decidedly bad omen. The goddess of the English climate, however, is such  a fickle deity that there is never the least dependence to be placed on  weather prophecies. She always seems to prefer to give a surprise. On  the day before the performance it rained; evening closed in with a  stormy sky, and every probability of waking next morning to find a  drizzle. Dulcie, putting her head out of the window last thing, reported  driving clouds and a total absence of stars.    Yet, lo and behold! they woke to one of those rare ethereal dawns that  come only now and then in a summer. The Blue bedroom faced east, and  over the line of laurels in the garden they could watch pearl and opal  flush into rosy pink before the sun shone out in an almost cloudless  sky. By nine o'clock the wet grass of yesterday was beginning to dry up,  and Miss Adams, with the help of Jones the gardener, was setting up her  scenery, and making initial arrangements for the business of the  afternoon.    She had contrived her open-air theater as far as possible on Greek  lines. There was no stage, but the audience sat on chairs on the grass,  and on cushions and rugs placed down a bank that commanded the lawn.  The performance was to begin at 3 o'clock, and soon after 2.30 visitors  began to arrive. There was quite a long row of cars in the drive,  bicycles were stacked against the veranda, and two ponies were put up in  the stable. Cousin Clare and her friends came in excellent time,  driven--much to Dulcie's satisfaction--by Milner, who in company with  the other chauffeurs received a cordial invitation from Miss Walters to  witness the show.    \"And wasn't it nice of him?\" said Dulcie to Carmel, \"he insisted on  giving a shilling to the funds. I told him it wasn't expected, but he  said he should _like_ to, if we didn't mind. Mind! Why, we want all the  money we can get!\"    \"I think Milner is an old dear!\" agreed Carmel.    Mr. Bowden had actually managed to get away from his office after all,  and had brought a niece with him in the side-car of his motor-bicycle.  He looked quite beaming, as if he meant to forget the law for a few  hours, and to enjoy himself. He sat next to Cousin Clare, chatting  affably and admiring the arrangements.    A piano had been carried out on to the lawn for the occasion, and Miss  Lowe, the music mistress, took her seat at it. She was supported by a  small school orchestra of three violins and violoncello, and together  they struck up some Eastern music. When it was well started there was a  flashing of white among the bushes on the farther side of the lawn, and  out came tripping a bevy of charming wood nymphs. They were all clad in  Greek chitons, very delicately draped, their hair was bound with gold  fillets, and their arms and feet were bare. They held aloft garlands of  flowers, and circling on that part of the lawn which formed the stage,  they went through the postures of a beautiful and intricate classic  dance.    Viewed against the background of trees and bushes it was a remarkably  pretty performance. There were no accessories of limelight or \"make-up\"  to give a theatrical or artificial effect; the afternoon sunshine fell  on the girls in their simple costumes, and showed a most natural scene  as their bare feet whirled lightly over the grass in time to the music,  and their uplifted arms waved the long garlands. There was a tremendous  clapping as they retired into the shelter of their classic groves.    The next item on Miss Adams' program was rather ambitious. An upright  screen of wood, covered with black paper, was placed upon "]]]
