MRS. MULLIGAN. My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely  too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?    MRS. O'TOOLE. Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with  me.    MRS. MULLIGAN. And where is he now?    MRS. O'TOOLE. Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy  Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay  for Mrs. O'Toole.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at  all, at all.    MRS. MULLIGAN. A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.    BRIDGET. Yis, mum. (_Exits R._)    MRS. O'TOOLE. I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage  for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the  cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and  I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water.  And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat,  Mrs. Mulligan.    MRS. MULLIGAN. There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things  easy.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking  I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.    MRS. MULLIGAN. So the goat struck ye, did he?    MRS. O'TOOLE. He did.    MRS. MULLIGAN. My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus  O'Brien. He's an awful goat, is Shamus O'Brien.    _Enter_ BRIDGET _with two cups of tea._    BRIDGET. Here's the tea, mum.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Thank ye kindly, Bridget. Here, Kathleen, take a cup of  tay and let it soothe your wounded feelings.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs.  Mulligan. (_Drinks tea._)    CLARISSA. Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?    MRS. MULLIGAN. My, my, I've been that excited about the misdeeds of  that rascal Shamus O'Brien that I had forgotten the Christmas  entertainment entirely.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in  society, Mollie Mulligan.    MRS. MULLIGAN. They are that. They're on their way to the fine church  entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.    NORA (_at door L._). Maw, here comes Matsy with the goat. (_Looks out  of door._)    MRS. MULLIGAN (_goes to door and speaks off L._). Matsy Mulligan, tie  that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll  tach him a lesson, if it's the last thing I ever do. Patsy, go out and  help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien. (_Exit_ PATSY _at L._)    MRS. O'TOOLE. Nora Eudora, darlin', have ye got a sofy pillow handy. I  think if I had a couple of sofy pillows I could set down and enjoy me  tay.    NORA. Yis, mum. Here's two of 'em. (_Arranges them in the chair._)    _Enter_ PATSY _and_ MATSY _from L._    MATSY. Come on, all of yeez, or we'll be late for the show. And I  don't want to miss nothin'.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_standing at R._). I think yeez are all ready now. Let  me see if there's anyone missing. (_Counting and pointing to each in  turn._)         There's Patsy and Matsy and Teddy Magee,       Nora Eudora and Micky Machree,       Bridget Honora and sweet Mary Ann,       Melissa, Clarissa and wee Peter Pan.    PATSY. We are all here, maw.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Now, yer all ready. Throw out yer heads. Forward,  march!    CHILDREN. Good-bye, maw.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Good-bye, and the Lord love yeez all. Have a good time.  Good-bye. (_The children march out at L._)    MRS. O'TOOLE. Ten of 'em. I don't see how ye ever manage to make both  ends meet, Mollie Mulligan, with ten big, healthy children--to say  nothing of the goat, Shamus O'Brien.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_in door waving hand to children_). Good-bye. Have a  good time. (_Yells._) Mary Ann, don't let yer sash bust in two!  (_Crosses to R. and sinks in chair._)    MRS. O'TOOLE. Ye have a fine family, Mrs. Mulligan. Ye have a fine  bunch of boys, and ye have a bunch of girls, and ye have a fine bunch  of babies; but ye have an awful goat.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Shamus O'Brien is the pest of me heart, Kathleen  O'Toole; so he is; but he's all that's left of me late husband's  property. Michael Mulligan thought the world of that goat, he did.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I'm a peaceful woman, Mollie Mulligan, and a calm,  neighborly woman; but I don't like goats.    MRS. MULLIGAN. I don't blame ye at all, at all, Kathleen. But poor  Shamus O'Brien was probably only nosing around fer a bit of Christmas  Eve dinner. I'll kape him tied in the future.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Sure and it is Christmas Eve, isn't it?    MRS. MULLIGAN. Indade it is, and for the sake of the holy eve, I think  ye'd best be after forgiving the poor goat and not harbor any ill  feeling agin him on Christmas Day.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie  Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head  on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_rises_). I'll be after tidying up the house a bit.  It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow  morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning  candle shining in the windy. (_Lights candle and sets it on table in  front of the window._)         This light shall burn on Christmas Day,       For Him who in the manger lay,       And all are welcome at my door,       The high, the low, the rich, the poor,       And every heart shall sing again       Of peace on earth, good will to men.    MRS. O'TOOLE (_rises_). Your burning candle takes me back again to the  days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas  Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window,  the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the  ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie,  darling?

There were men mean enough      to suspect that the construction I gave to the Nicholson letter      was prompted by the confidence and affection I felt for General      Taylor. At a subsequent period, however, Mr. Cass thoroughly      reviewed it. He uttered (for him) very harsh language against      all who had doubted the true construction of his letter, and he      construed it just as I had done during the canvass of 1848. It      remains only to add that I supported Mr. Cass, not because of      the doctrine of the Nicholson letter, but in despite of it;      because I believed a Democratic President, with a Democratic      Cabinet and Democratic counselors in the two Houses of Congress,      and he as honest a man as I believed Mr. Cass to be, would be a      safer reliance than his opponent, who personally possessed my      confidence as much as any man living, but who was of, and must      draw his advisers from, a party the tenets of which I believed      to be opposed to the interests of the country, as they were to      all my political convictions.        \"I little thought at that time that my advocacy of Mr. Cass upon      such grounds as these, or his support by the State of which I am      a citizen, would at any future day be quoted as an endorsement      of the opinions contained in the Nicholson letter, as those      opinions were afterward defined. But it is not only upon this      letter, but equally upon the resolutions of the Convention as      constructive of that letter, that the Senator rested his      argument. [I will here say to the Senator that, if at any time I      do him the least injustice, speaking as I do from such notes as      I could take while he progressed, I will thank him to correct      me.]        \"But this letter entered into the canvass; there was a doubt      about its construction: there were men who asserted that they      had positive authority for saying that it meant that the people      of a Territory could only exclude slavery when the Territory      should form a Constitution and be admitted as a State. This      doubt continued to hang over the construction, and it was that      doubt alone which secured Mr. Cass the vote of Mississippi. If      the true construction had been certainly known, he would have      had no chance to get it.\"    Whatever meaning the generally discreet and conservative statesman, Mr.  Cass, may have intended to convey, it is not at all probable that he  foresaw the extent to which the suggestions would be carried and the  consequences that would result from it.    In the organization of a government for California in 1850, the theory  was more distinctly advanced, but it was not until after the passage of  the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, in 1854, that it was fully developed under the  plastic and constructive genius of the Hon. Stephen A. Douglas, of  Illinois. The leading part which that distinguished Senator had borne in  the authorship and advocacy of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which affirmed  the right of the people of the Territories \"to form and regulate their  domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution  of the United States,\" had aroused against him a violent storm of  denunciation in the State which he represented and other Northern  States. He met it very manfully in some respects, defended his action  resolutely, but in so doing was led to make such concessions of  principle and to attach such an interpretation to the bill as would have  rendered it practically nugatory--a thing to keep the promise of peace  to the ear and break it to the hope.    The Constitution expressly confers upon Congress the power to admit new  States into the Union, and also to \"dispose of and make all needful  rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property  belonging to the United States.\" Under these grants of power, the  uniform practice of the Government had been for Congress to lay off and  divide the common territory by convenient boundaries for the formation  of future States; to provide executive, legislative, and judicial  departments of government for such Territories during their temporary  and provisional period of pupilage; to delegate to these governments  such authority as might be expedient--subject always to the supervision  and controlling government of the Congress. Finally, at the proper time,  and on the attainment by the Territory of sufficient strength and  population for self-government, to receive it into the Union on a  footing of entire equality with the original States--sovereign and  self-governing. All this is no more inconsistent with the true  principles of \"popular sovereignty,\" properly understood, than the  temporary subjection of a minor to parental control is inconsistent with  the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence, or the exceptional  discipline of a man-of-war or a military post with the principles of  republican freedom.    The usual process of transition from a territorial condition to that of  a State was, in the first place, by an act of Congress authorizing the  inhabitants to elect representatives for a convention to form a State  Constitution, which was then submitted to Congress for approval and  ratification. On such ratification the supervisory control of Congress  was withdrawn, and the new State authorized to assume its sovereignty,  and the inhabitants of the Territory became citizens of a State. In the  cases of Tennessee in 1796, and Arkansas and Michigan in 1836, the  failure of the inhabitants to obtain an \"enabling act\" of Congress,  before organizing themselves, very nearly caused the rejection of their  applications for admission as States, though they were eventually  granted on the ground that the subsequent approval and consent of  Congress could heal the prior irregularity. The entire control of  Congress over the whole subject of territorial government had never been  questioned in earlier times. Necessarily conjoined with the _power_ of  this protectorate, was of course the _duty_ of exercising it for the  safety of the persons and property of all citizens of the United States,  permanently or temporarily resident in any part of the domain belonging  to the States in common.    Logically carried out, the new theory of \"popular sovereignty\" would  apply to the first adventurous pioneers settling in the wilderness  before the organization of any Territorial government by Congress, as  well as afterward. If \"sovereignty\" is inherent in a thousand or five  thousand persons, there can be no valid ground for denying its existence  in a dozen, as soon as they pass beyond the limits of the State  governments. The advocates of this novel doctrine, however, if rightly  understood, generally disavowed any claim to its application prior to  the organization of a territorial government.    The Territorial Legislatures, to which Congress delegated a portion of  its power and duty to \"make all needful rules and regulations respecting  the Territory,\" were the mere agents of Congress, exercising an  authority subject to Congressional supervision and control--an authority  conferred only for the sake of convenience, and liable at any time to be  revoked and annulled. Yet it is proposed to recognize in these  provisional, subordinate, and temporary legislative bodies, a power not  possessed by Congress itself. This is to claim that the creature is  endowed with an authority not possessed by the creator, or that the  stream has risen to an elevation above that of its source.    Furthermore, in contending for a power in the Territorial Legislatures  permanently to determine the fundamental, social, and political  institutions of the Territory, and thereby virtually to prescribe those  of the future State, the advocates of \"popular sovereignty\" were  investing those dependent and subsidiary bodies with powers far above  any exercised by the Legislatures of the fully organized and sovereign  States. The authority of the State Legislatures is limited, both by the  Federal Constitution and by the respective State Constitutions from  which it is derived. This latter limitation did not and could not exist  in the Territories.    Strange as it may seem, a theory founded on fallacies so flimsy and  leading to conclusions so paradoxical was advanced by eminent and  experienced politicians, and accepted by many persons, both in the North  and in the South--not so much, perhaps, from intelligent conviction as  under the delusive hope that it would afford a satisfactory settlement  of the \"irrepressible conflict\" which had been declared. The terms  \"popular sovereignty\" and \"non-intervention\" were plausible, specious,  and captivating to the public ear. Too many lost sight of the elementary  truth that political sovereignty does not reside in unorganized or  partially organized masses of individuals, but in the people of  regularly and permanently constituted States. As to the  \"non-intervention\" proposed, it meant merely the abnegation by Congress  of its duty to protect the inhabitants of the Territories subject to its  control.    The raid into Virginia under John Brown--already notorious as a  fanatical partisan leader in the Kansas troubles--occurred in October,  1859, a few weeks before the meeting of the Thirty-sixth Congress.  Insignificant in itself and in its immediate results, it afforded a  startling revelation of the extent to which sectional hatred and  political fanaticism had blinded the conscience of a class of persons in  certain States of the Union; forming a party steadily growing stronger  in numbers, as well as in activity. Sympathy with its purposes or  methods was earnestly disclaimed by the representatives of all parties  in Congress; but it was charged, on the"]]]
