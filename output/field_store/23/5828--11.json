With the pigments the assistants  painted the notched wands; with the plumes the chanter trimmed them.  (See Fig. 51 and Plate XI.) Then they were called Ã§obolÃ§Ã , a word of  obscure etymology, or inÂ¢ia`, which signifies sticking up or standing  erect. They are called in this paper \"plumed wands.\"    92. While some were making the Ã§obolÃ§Ã  others busied themselves  grinding, between stones, large quantities of pigments, coarser than  those referred to above, to be used in making the sand pictures or dry  paintings of the ceremony. They made five colors: black, of charcoal;  white, of white sandstone; red, of red sandstone; yellow, of yellow  sandstone; and \"blue,\" of the black and white, mixed in proper  proportions; of course this was a gray, but it was their only cheap  substitute for the cerulean tint, and, combined with the other colors on  the sanded floor, in the dim light of the lodge, it could not easily be  distinguished from a true blue. It may be remarked in passing that the  Navajo apply to many things which are gray the term they use for blue  (Ã§olÃ­j); thus the gray fox is called mÃ Ã¯-Ã§olÃ­j (blue coyote) and a gray  sheep is called a blue sheep. Yet that they make a distinction between  these colors is, I think, fairly evident from the fact that in painting  small articles, such as kethÃ wns and masks, they use the more costly  articles of turquoise, malachite, and indigo. These coarse pigments for  the dry paintings were put for convenience on curved pieces of piÃ±on  bark. From time to time, during this and the following days, as the  heaps of colored powder diminished under the hands of the artists, more  stones and charcoal were pulverized to replenish them.    93. About noon they cleared off that portion of the floor of the lodge  which lay west of the fire, and brought, in blankets, a quantity of dry  sand, which they spread out over the cleared portion of the floor in a  layer of the nearly constant depth of three inches. They smoothed the  surface with the broad oaken battens used in weaving. Now for a time all  operations were suspended in the lodge while the chanter went out to  plant the Ã§obolÃ§Ã , or plumed wands, in front of the medicine lodge, and  to lay beside them the collars of beaver skins and the symbols for wings  which the couriers were to wear next day. (Fig. 51.) These articles, it  was said, were placed outside as a sign to the gods that the holy  pictures were being drawn; but it is not improbable that they were  intended also as a sign to uninitiated mortals. However that may be,  they were taken in as soon as the picture was finished. The great  painting was begun about 1 o'clock p.m., was finished about 3, and was  allowed to remain until the ceremonies at night were concluded. It will  be described later. (Paragraphs 160 et seq.)      [Illustration: FIG. 51. The Ã§obolÃ§Ã , or plumed wands, as seen from    the door of the medicine lodge.]    94. When the picture was completed food was brought in, and there was a  good deal of eating and sleeping and smoking done. Being informed that  nothing more would be done until after nightfall, I went to my own  shelter, to elaborate some of my more hasty sketches while matters were  still fresh in my mind. At 7 o'clock a messenger came to tell me that  ceremonies were about to be resumed. During my absence the principal  character in the night's performance--a man arrayed in evergreens--had  been dressed.    95. I found, on returning to the lodge, a number of spectators seated  around close to the edge of the apartment. The fire burned in the  center. The sick woman, with some companions, sat in the south. The  qaÃ§Ã li, with a few assistants who joined him in singing and shaking  rattles, was seated at the north, at the place where the circumference  of the lodge was enlarged. (Paragraph 83.) There was a space about two  feet wide and six feet long between them and the wall, or roof if you  choose so to call it, of the lodge. I was assigned a place in the west.  The sick woman was directed to move from the position she occupied in  the south, and sit, with her face to the east, at the junction of the  two white serpents that cross one another on the picture. (Plate XV.)    96. When she was seated the qaÃ§Ã li began a song, accompanied by the  usual rattling and drumming. At a certain part of the song the chanter  was seen to make a slight signal with his drumstick, a rapid stroke to  the rear, when instantly a mass of animate evergreens--a moving tree, it  seemed--sprang out from the space behind the singers and rushed towards  the patient. A terrifying yell from the spectators greeted the  apparition, when the man in green, acting as if frightened by the noise,  retreated as quickly as he came, and in a moment nothing could be seen  in the space behind the singers but the shifting shadows cast by the  fire. He was so thoroughly covered with spruce twigs that nothing of his  form save his toes could be distinguished when he rushed out in the full  glare of the fire. This scene was repeated three times, at due  intervals.    97. Some time after the third repetition, the chanter arose, without  interrupting his song, and proceeded to erase the picture with his  rattle. He began with the mountain in the west (paragraph 162), which he  completely leveled; next in order he erased the track of the bear; next,  the hole in the center; and then, one by one, the various other figures,  ending with the serpents on the outside. In erasing the serpents, he  began with the figures in the east and followed the apparent course of  the sun, ending with the figures in the north. When the picture was  completely obliterated, the sand on which it had been drawn was  collected, put in a blanket, and carried out of doors, to be thrown  away.    98. Then the sick woman was lifted by two other women and laid on her  side where the picture had been, with her face to the east. While she  lay there, the medicine man, amid much singing, walked around her,  inscribed on the earth at her feet a straight line with his finger and  erased it with his foot, inscribed at her head a cross and rubbed it out  in the same manner, traced radiating lines in all directions from her  body and obliterated them, gave her a light massage, whistled over her  from head to foot and all around her, and whistled towards the smoke  hole, as if whistling something away. These acts were performed in the  order in which they are recorded. His last operation on her was a severe  massage, in which he kneaded every part of her body forcibly and pulled  her joints hard, whereat she groaned and made demonstrations of  suffering. This concluded, she rose. A blanket was spread on the ground  on the north of the fire, near where the man in evergreens was  concealed. At the last appearance of the man in evergreens the woman  fell back apparently paralyzed and suffering from difficulty of  breathing, all of which was probably feigned, but was supposed to be a  sign that the right remedy or ceremony for her ailment had been found  and that none other need be tried. The medicine man now proceeded to  restore her to consciousness by drawing zigzag lines from her body east  and west and straight lines north and south, like their symbols for the  chain and sheet lightnings, by stepping over her in different  directions, and by rattling. When she had apparently recovered, he  pressed the plumed wands and the symbols for wings to different parts of  her body, in the order and with the ceremonies described when referring  to previous application made to her body.    99. There were no more ceremonies that night. I remained in the medicine  lodge until it was quite late. The men occupied their time in singing,  rattling, gambling, and smoking. After a while some grew weary and lay  down to sleep. Being repeatedly assured that nothing more would happen  until the whistle sounded in the morning, I left the lodge to roll  myself in my blankets. Yet frequently during the night, fearing I might  have been deceived, I stealthily arose and visited the medicine lodge,  only to find all slumbering soundly.      100. SIXTH DAY. At five in the morning (Saturday, October 25) the  whistle sounded and I hastened to the medicine lodge. There was much to  be done; the couriers were to be dressed and sent on their way, and a  large picture was to be painted; so the work had to begin early.      [Illustration: FIG. 52. AkÃ¡ninili ready for the journey.]    101. The first thing done was to burn to charcoal the bundle of plants  which had been gathered on the previous morning and hung over the door  of the lodge inside. (Paragraph 90.) The charcoal was used in painting  the limbs of the akÃ¡ninilis or couriers. A basin of water containing  soap root or amolÃ« (the root of _Yucca baccata_, and other species of  yucca) was brought in, and after the medicine man had dabbed them with a  little of the suds the akÃ¡ninilis-elect washed themselves with it from  head to foot, cleaning their hair well. When the bath was done, they  were dabbed by the qaÃ§Ã li with some other mixture contained in a  waterproof wicker basin and were made to inhale the fragrant fumes of  some vegetable powder scattered on a live coal, which, as usual, was  \"put out,\" in a double sense, when the fumigation was over. Then the  young men were dressed and adorned to look like Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni after his  toilet in the house of the butterflies. (Paragraph 44.) Their legs and  forearms were painted black, to represent the storm cloud. The outer  aspects of these members were decorated with white zigzag streaks, to  indicate the white lightning. Their faces were painted partly white and  small white spots were scattered over their bodies. Downy eagle feathers  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],[0,"Rebel Spurs (#13)"],[1,"up  into Kansas or Missouri, an' sell. A couple of th' boys had run stuff in  that way for th' army, even swum 'em across the Mississippi. It would  maybe give us a start. An'--well, there weren't nothin' else to do. So we  tried it.\" Anse sat staring down at the water lapping at his lean middle.  His was a very thin body, the ribs standing out beneath the skin almost as  harshly as did the weal of the scar on his shoulder.    \"And it didn't work?\"    \"Well, it might've. I ain't sayin' it won't for some hombres. Only we run  into trouble. Texas ain't Texas no more; it's th' Fifth Military District.  Any man what fought for th' Confederacy ain't got any rights. It's worse'n  an Injun war. We got us our herd, leastwise th' beginnin' of one. An' that  was back-breakin' work--we was feelin' as beat as when we run out of  Tennessee after Franklin. Only we kept to it, 'cause it would give us a  stake. So we started drivin' north, an' they jumped us.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Yankees--th' brand what probably set at home an' let others do th' real  fightin'--ready to come in an' take over once th' shootin' was done with.  They grabbed th' herd. Shot Will Bachus when he stood up to 'em, an' made  it all legal 'cause they had a tin-horn deputy ridin' with 'em. Well, we  got him anyway an' two or three of th' others. But then they called in th'  army, an' we had to ride for it. Scattered so they had more'n one trail to  follow. But they posted us as 'wanted' back there. So I come whippin' a  mighty tired hoss outta Texas, an' I ain't plannin' on goin' back to any  Fifth Military District!\"    \"Any chance they'll push a star after you here?\"    \"No. I'm jus' small stuff, not worth botherin' 'bout by their reckonin',  now I ain't got anythin' left them buzzards can pick offen m' bones.  They's sittin' tight an' gittin' fat right there.\"    \"Then it's all set.\" Drew tossed Anse a towel. \"Climb out and we'll get  started!\"    \"Doin what?\"    \"You've worked horses, and they can use another wrangler on the Range.  Right now they've a lot to be topped--want to gentle 'em some and trade 'em  south into Mexico. If you ride for _Don_ Cazar, nobody's goin' to ask too  many questions.\"    \"How d'you know he'll sign me on?\" Anse studied his own unkempt if now  clean reflection in the shaving mirror on the wall. \"I sure don't look  like no bargain.\"    \"You will when we're through with you,\" Drew began. The Texan swung  around.    \"Looky here, you thinkin' of grub stakin'? I ain't gonna--\"    \"Suppose you had yourself a stack of cart wheels and my pockets were to  let?\" Drew retorted. \"I think I remember me some times when we had one  blanket and a hunk of hardtack between us, and there weren't any 'yours'  or 'mine' about it! Or don't you think back that far?\"    Anse laughed. \"All right, _compadre_, pretty me up like a new stake rope  on a thirty-dollar pony. If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m'  foreleg an' reshoe me anyway. Right now--I'll say it out good'n clear--I'm  so pore m' backbone rattles when I cough.\"    \"Mistuh Kirby--\" Hamilcar came in. \"Mistuh Nye says to tell you he'll be  back. Mistuh Shannon's in bed at th' doctuh's; he's gonna be all right  soon's he gets ovah a mighty big headache.\"    He had actually forgotten Shannon! Hastily Drew expressed his satisfaction  at the news and added:    \"This is my cousin from Texas, Hamilcar. He hit town ridin' light. I'm  goin' over to pick him up a new outfit at Stein's. You give him all the  rest, will you?\"    \"Yes, suh.\"    Blue blouses--a corporal's guard of troopers--were pulling up by the cantina  hitch rail as Drew came out into the plaza. Muller's men probably, he  thought. But now he was more intent on Anse's needs.    Few people had ever broken through the crust of self-sufficiency the  Kentuckian had begun to grow in early childhood. His grandfather's bitter  hatred of his father had made Drew an outsider at Red Springs from birth  and had finally driven him away to join General Morgan in '62. Those he  had ever cared about he could list on the fingers of one sun-browned,  rein-hardened hand: Cousin Meredith; her son Shelly--he had died at  Chickamauga between one short breath and the next--Shelly's younger brother  Boyd, who had run away to join Morgan, too, in the sunset of the raider's  career; and Anse, whom he had believed dead until this past hour.    Drew was breathing as fast as if he had charged across the sun-baked plaza  at a run, when he came into the general store which supplied Tubacca with  nine-tenths of the materials necessary for frontier living. He made his  selection with care.    \"You planning a trip, Mister Kirby?\" Stein peered at him over a pair of  old-fashioned, steel-bowed spectacles which perched on his sharp parrot's  beak of a nose.    \"No. My cousin just rode in; he lost his gear on the road and needs a new  outfit complete.\"    Stein nodded, patted smooth the top shirt on a growing pile. \"Anything  else?\"    \"Add those up. I'll look around.\" Drew paused to glance into the single  small, glass-fronted case which was Stein's claim to fame in the  surrounding territory. The exotic wares on display were a strange mixture:  a few pieces of jewelry, heavy Spanish things which might be a century or  more old, several six-guns--one with an ornate ivory handle.... Drew  stopped and pulled a finger across the dusty surface of the glass case.  Spurs--silver spurs--not quite so elaborate as those he now wore, but of the  same general workmanship.    \"I'd like to look at those spurs.\"    Stein unlocked the case and took them out. As Drew unstrapped those he  wore and fitted the new pair to his boots, a brown, calf-bound book  thudded to the floor. Books--here in Stein's?    Weighing the volume in his hand, the Kentuckian straightened up. There  were two more books lying on the top of the case. The leather bindings  were scuffed and one was scored clear across the back, yet they had been  handsome, undoubtedly treasured. Drew turned them up to read the scrolled  gold titles on their spines.    \"_History of the Conquest of Mexico_, _The Three Musketeers,__ The Count  of Monte Cristo_ ... Where'd these come from, Mister Stein?\" Drew's  curiosity was aroused.    \"That is a story almost as fanciful as the ones inside them.\" Stein rested  his bony elbows on the counter as he talked. \"Would you believe, Mister  Kirby, these were brought to me by Amos Lutterfield?\"    \"Lutterfield? Who's he?\"    \"I forget, you have not been in Tubacca long. Amos Lutterfield--he is what  one might term a character, a strange one. He goes out into the wilds  alone, seeking always the gold.\"    \"In Apache country?\" Drew demanded.    \"The Apaches, they do not touch a man they believe insane, and Amos has  many peculiarities: peculiarities of dress, of speech, of action. He roams  undisturbed, sometimes coming in with relics from the old cliff houses to  trade for supplies. Last month he told me a story of a cave where he found  a trunk. Where it had come from or why it was hidden he did not know, but  these books were in it. Like some men who have no formal education, Amos  is highly respectful of the printed word. He thought the books of great  value and so brought them here.\"    Drew opened the top volume. Back home books as well bound as these would  have carried a personal bookplate or at least the written name of the  owner, but the fly leaf was bare. They had the look of well-read,  cherished volumes but no mark of possession.    \"You have perhaps read these?\" Stein asked.    Drew picked up _The Three Musketeers_. \"Not likely to forget this one,\" he  said, grinning. \"Earned me a good ten with the cane when I read it instead  of dealing faithfully with Caesar's campaigns in Gaul. I did get to finish  it before I was caught out.\" The pages separated stiffly under his  exploring fingers as if the volume had not been opened for a long time. He  did not notice that Stein was eyeing him with new appraisal.    \"These for sale?\"    \"In Stein's everything is for sale.\" The storekeeper named a price, and  Drew bargained. When he left, the three books reposed on the top of his  armload of clothing, and a half hour later he dropped them down on a  cantina table. Anse came from the bathhouse and sat down in the opposite  chair. His booted foot moved, but now rowel points flashed in the sun. The  Texan regarded the Mexican spurs joyfully, stooped to jingle them with his  finger tip.    \"Can't believe it ... how they came back to you,\" he marveled. \"One of  them Yankees musta took 'em off me, thinkin' I was cashin' in m' chips.  Sure feels good to git 'em back on my heels agin, sorta like they was m'  luck. Pa, he set a right lot by them spurs. Gave 'em to me when I gentle  broke a wild one none o' th' other boys could back. Was I turkey-cock  proud th' first day I rode into town with 'em playin' pretty tunes, even  though I strapped 'em on over boots as was only three pieces of leather  hangin' to each other restless like. Yeah, Pa, he got 'em in the Mexican  War, an' me, I wore 'em mostly through this past ruckus. They's sure seen  a lotta history bein' made by men climbin' up an' down from saddles!\"    \"Let's hope ... no more wars.\" Drew set the three books in a pile and  regarded them attentively. Stein's story of their origin--out of a trunk  hidden in a desert cave--was most intriguing. What else had been in that  trunk?    \"Anse,\" he asked, \"why would anyone hide a trunk in a cave?\" \"Might depend  on what was in it,\" the Texan replied promptly.    \"Well, these were--\"    Anse took up the top book. His finger traced each word as he read. \"_The  Three Mus--Musketeers._ Whatever kinda critter is that?\"    \"A soldier. They used to have them over in France a long time ago.\"    \"Army manual, eh? Maybe so the trunk was an army cache--\"    Drew shook his head. \"No, this is just a story. A good one with lots of  prime fightin' in it. This one's a story, too. I've heard about it ...  never "]]]
