Miss Fitzgerald!\" shouted Mr. Townsend, but he might  as well have spoken to the wind. Honor had found her opportunity, and  was quick to seize it. Instead of attempting to pull up Victor, she let  him have his head. She had no desire to check his pace, the motion was  so exhilarating; and she could not resist the temptation to display her  horsemanship before the rest of the class. The unfortunate master dared  not desert his other nervous and inexperienced pupils to give chase,  and in a few minutes she had left the remainder of the party a mile  behind. They could see her tearing past the coastguard station, where  an old man with a telescope yelled wildly to her to stop; past a  windmill, where children and chickens scrambled in hot haste out of her  path; and away over the moor, until she quite disappeared from sight.    The girls were in a panic of alarm. Mr. Townsend turned rather white,  but preserved his presence of mind, and, leading his little company  straight to the coastguard station, made all dismount, and tied up the  horses. Then he set out himself in pursuit of the runaway.    Honor, meanwhile, continued her \"John Gilpin\" galop. On and on she  flew, her hair, as the fairy tales say, \"whistling in the wind\". It  occurred to her at last that she might be going too far, and she made  an effort to pull up. But it was of no avail; Victor had got the bit  firmly between his teeth, and nothing could hold him. Luckily, the girl  did not lose her nerve, but waited until she could tire him out, and  get him in hand again; and I verily believe she would have succeeded in  mastering him, and turning him safely on his homeward course, had not  the way been unexpectedly barred by a fence. The poor old horse must  have been a hunter during some period of his life; he went at the fence  like a greyhound, and cleared it nimbly: but there were a trench and a  rough bank on the farther side, and as he alighted he stumbled,  flinging Honor violently from the saddle. Mercifully, her foot came  clear of the stirrup, and she rolled safely into a bed of nettles,  while Victor, scrambling up again, made off without her over the crest  of the hill.    Honor picked herself out of the nettles as quickly as she could. No  bones were broken, and, except for some painful stings, she was none  the worse for her adventure.    Nevertheless, the situation was awkward. There she was on the open  moor, many miles away from Chessington, and obliged to make her way  home to St. Chad's as best she could. She climbed over the fence, and,  holding up her habit, set out to walk back in the direction in which  she had come.    It seemed slow progress compared with riding, and she began to wonder  how long it would take her to retrace her steps. She had not gone more  than half a mile, however, when she met Mr. Townsend, who had at last  succeeded in reaching her. His relief at finding her alive and unhurt  was almost too great for words. He put her quietly on his own horse,  and led it by the bridle back to the coastguard station, where the rest  of the girls were waiting, very anxious to know what had become of  Honor, and very rejoiced when they saw she was safe.    There was no further riding lesson that day. As Maisie Talbot explained  afterwards to a select company of interested friends: \"I'm sure Mr.  Townsend was frightfully angry, but he scarcely said a word. He only  took us straight home at once, in a kind of solemn procession. He had  to walk himself, leading Honor's and Violet's horses, so of course we  went horribly slowly; and he looked so savage that nobody dared to  speak.\"    \"What possessed you, Paddy?\" asked Lettice.    \"I had an idea of going to see Dermot,\" confessed Honor. \"I thought if  I rode straight up to the Grange, and asked leave from Dr. Winterton,  perhaps he'd let us have half an hour together.\"    \"Well, you are the silliest goose! Why, the Grange is in exactly the  opposite direction! Will you never learn sense?\" and Lettice collapsed  with laughter.    \"Mr. Townsend is having a long talk with Miss Maitland at this present  moment,\" announced Ruth Latimer.    \"Then I'm glad I'm not you, Paddy!\" chuckled Lettice.    Nobody ever knew the details of Mr. Townsend's interview with the  house-mistress, or what explanation he gave of the affair. Though he  was perfectly persuaded that it was Honor's own fault, it was difficult  for him to blame her for what might, after all, have been a mere  accident; so, beyond a few words of warning about the danger of  whipping her horse without proper orders, she did not on this occasion  receive the scolding that she certainly merited.    Victor was found on the hills six miles away from Chessington, gently  cropping the grass, and allowed himself to be caught by a passing  farmer. He was not used at the riding lessons again. Honor was in  future given the tamest and least-spirited of the mounts, and for the  next two lessons was even kept strictly to the leading rein.    \"She's fearfully disgusted about it,\" said Lettice, \"and it certainly  is a humiliation, when she can ride so well. It's quite the worst  punishment Mr. Townsend could possibly have given her, and I expect he  knows it!\"          CHAPTER VI    The Lower Third      The Lower Third Form at Chessington College numbered seventeen pupils,  eight of whom were members of St. Chad's. In addition to Honor, these  included Maisie and Lettice Talbot, Ruth Latimer, Pauline Reynolds,  Janie Henderson, Effie Lawson, and Flossie Taylor. The teacher, Miss  Farrar, was rather a favourite with her class. Though she could well  uphold her authority, and maintain the good discipline that was  universal in the school, she was not so strict as some of the other  mistresses. She had a very pleasant, genial manner; she was a capital  tennis player, and no mean figure at hockey and cricket; she was a  prominent supporter of the Debating Society and the Natural History  Union; and was altogether so cheerful and brisk that \"jolly\" was the  word generally applied to her. Honor liked Miss Farrar, and, according  to her lights, really made a heroic effort in the direction of good  behaviour. Her conduct was certainly immeasurably superior to what it  had been with her governesses at home, and yet, judged by Chessington  standards, it was frequently irregular and unorthodox. With her best  endeavours, she could not grasp the fact that education is a very  solemn affair, and a school-room about the last place in the world  where one should try to be funny. She never seemed able to be  absolutely serious, and at the least opportunity her Celtic humour  would flash out, and not only upset the gravity of the class, but  sometimes even cause Miss Farrar to have a difficulty in keeping her  countenance.    She was a slightly disturbing element in the Form. When it was her turn  to answer there would be an air of general expectancy in the room; the  didactic language of the textbooks was often paraphrased by her lips  into something of a more racy description, and even her mistakes were  as delicious as her quaint methods of stating facts. Miss Farrar  occasionally suspected her of intentionally giving wrong replies, for  the sheer satisfaction of causing amusement; but it was difficult to  prove the charge, since, however ludicrous her statements might be, she  never under any circumstances laughed at them herself, and all the  while her large, grey Irish eyes would be fixed upon her teacher with  the innocence of a baby.    Thanks to Janie Henderson's assiduity, Honor conformed tolerably well  to the ordinary rules. Mindful of Miss Maitland's charge, Janie  considered herself responsible for Honor, and was continually ready to  jog her memory about what exercises must be written, what lessons  learnt, and what books brought to class, all of which were details that  her friend would not have troubled about on her own account; but in  spite of her exertions the poor girl often saw her protegee in trouble.    \"The worst of it is,\" she admitted to herself, \"that one never knows  what to expect. Honor is a darling, but she does such peculiar and  extraordinary things, she almost takes one's breath away. If I could be  prepared for them beforehand, and warn her, it might be of some use;  but I can't, so she's bound to get into scrapes.\"    Undoubtedly, very unprecedented happenings took place in the Lower  Third--happenings such as had never occurred before Honor's advent. Who  but she would have thought of tilting two books together and emptying  the inkpot on the top of them, when asked to describe a watershed? Yet  she looked genuinely astonished when the vials of Miss Farrar's wrath  descended upon her, and said almost reproachfully that she was only  trying to give a practical illustration.    One day she smuggled Pete, the kitten from St. Chad's, into class, and  shut him inside her desk, where he settled down quite comfortably, and  slept peacefully through the French lesson. But in the middle of  algebra, Honor, who hated mathematics, managed to give him a  surreptitious pinch, with the result that a long-drawn, impatient,  objecting \"miau\" suddenly resounded through the room. Miss Farrar gave  quite a jump, and looked round, but could see nothing. Honor sat bolt  upright, with arms folded and eyes fixed attentively on the blackboard,  as if she were sublimely unconscious of any noise in her vicinity.    \"What can it be? It sounds like a cat,\" said Miss Farrar, peering about  on the floor, and even peeping into the cupboard where the chalk and  the new books were kept.    The girls jumped up, and pretended to look under their desks. Most of  them had an inkling of the situation, but they were human enough to  enjoy an interruption in the midst of difficult equations.    \"Perhaps it's a mouse in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#13)"],[1,"gave the States a new motive for unity, a  common inheritance which any State refusing or abandoning union must  surrender.    Meanwhile it would be unjust to the supporters of State Rights to deny  the excellence and importance of their contribution to the  Constitutional settlement. To them is due the establishment of local  liberties with safeguards such as no other Constitution gives. And, in  spite of the military victory which put an end to the disputes about  State Sovereignty and finally established the Federalist interpretation  of the Constitution, this part of their work endures. The internal  affairs of every State remain as the Constitution left them, absolutely  in its own control. The Federal Government never interferes save for  purposes of public taxation, and, in the rare case of necessity, of  national defence. For the rest nine-tenths of the laws under which an  American citizen lives, nearly all the laws that make a practical  difference to his life, are State laws. Under the Constitution, as  framed, the States were free to form their separate State Constitutions  according to their own likings, and to arrange the franchise and the  test of citizenship, even for Federal purposes, in their own fashion.  This, with the one stupid and mischievous exception made by the  ill-starred Fifteenth Amendment, remains the case to this day, with the  curious consequence, among others, that it is now theoretically possible  for a woman to become President of the United States, if she is the  citizen of a State where female suffrage is admitted.    Turning to the structure of the central authority which the Constitution  sought to establish, the first thing that strikes us--in the teeth of  the assertion of most British and some American writers--is that it was  emphatically _not_ a copy of the British Constitution in any sense  whatever. It is built on wholly different principles, drawn mostly from  the French speculations of that age. Especially one notes, alongside of  the careful and wise separation of the judiciary from the executive, the  sound principle enunciated by Montesquieu and other French thinkers of  the eighteenth century, but rejected and contemned by England (to her  great hurt) as a piece of impracticable logic--the separation of the  executive and legislative powers. It was this principle which made  possible the later transformation of the Presidency into a sort of  Elective Monarchy.    This result was not designed or foreseen; or rather it was to an extent  foreseen, and deliberately though unsuccessfully guarded against. The  American revolutionists were almost as much under the influence of  classical antiquity as the French. From it they drew the noble  conception of \"the Republic,\" the public thing acting with impersonal  justice towards all citizens. But with it they also drew an exaggerated  dread of what they called \"Caesarism,\" and with it they mixed the curious  but characteristic illusion of that age--an illusion from which, by the  way, Rousseau himself was conspicuously free--that the most satisfactory  because the most impersonal organ of the general will is to be found in  an elected assembly. They had as yet imperfectly learnt that such an  assembly must after all consist of persons, more personal because less  public than an acknowledged ruler. They did not know that, while a  despot may often truly represent the people, a Senate, however chosen,  always tends to become an oligarchy. Therefore they surrounded the  presidential office with checks which in mere words made the President  seem less powerful than an English King. Yet he has always in fact been  much more powerful. And the reason is to be found in the separation of  the executive from the legislature. The President, while his term  lasted, had the full powers of a real executive. Congress could not turn  him out, though it could in various ways check his actions. He could  appoint his own Ministers (though the Senate must ratify the choice) and  they were wisely excluded from the legislature. An even wiser provision  limited the appointment of Members of Congress to positions under the  executive. Thus both executive and legislature were kept, so far as  human frailty permitted, pure in their normal functions. The Presidency  remained a real Government. Congress remained a real check.    In England, where the opposite principle was adopted, the Ministry  became first the committee of an oligarchical Parliament and later a  close corporation nominating the legislature which is supposed to check  it.    The same fear of arbitrary power was exhibited, and that in fashion  really inconsistent with the democratic principles which the American  statesmen professed, in the determination that the President should be  chosen by the people only in an indirect fashion, through an Electoral  College. This error has been happily overruled by events. Since the  Electoral College was to be chosen _ad hoc_ for the single purpose of  choosing a President, it soon became obvious that pledges could easily  be exacted from its members in regard to their choice. By degrees the  pretence of deliberate action by the College wore thinner and thinner.  Finally it was abandoned altogether, and the President is now chosen, as  the first magistrate of a democracy ought to be chosen, if election is  resorted to at all, by the direct vote of the nation. At the time,  however, it was supposed that the Electoral College would be an  independent deliberative assembly. It was further provided that the  second choice of the Electoral College should be Vice-President, and  succeed to the Presidency in the event of the President dying during his  term of office. If there was a \"tie\" or if no candidate had an absolute  majority in the College, the election devolved on the House of  Representatives voting in this instance by States.    In connection with the election both of Executive and Legislature, the  old State Rights problem rose in another form. Were all the States to  have equal weight and representation, as had been the case in the old  Continental Congress, or was their weight and representation to be  proportional to their population? On this point a compromise was made.  The House of Representatives was to be chosen directly by the people on  a numerical basis, and in the Electoral College which chose the  President the same principle was adopted. In the Senate all States were  to have equal representation; and the Senators were to be chosen by the  legislatures of the States; they were regarded rather as ambassadors  than as delegates. The term of a Senator was fixed for six years, a  third of the Senate resigning in rotation every two years. The House of  Representatives was to be elected in a body for two years. The President  was elected for four years, at the end of which time he could be  re-elected.    Such were the main lines of the compromises which were effected between  the conflicting views of the extreme Federalists and extreme State Rights  advocates, and the conflicting interests of the larger and smaller States.  But there was another threatened conflict, more formidable and, as the  event proved, more enduring, with which the framers of the Constitution  had to deal. Two different types of civilization had grown up on opposite  sides of the Mason-Dixon line. How far Slavery was the cause and how far  a symptom of this divergence will be discussed more fully in future  chapters. At any rate it was its most conspicuous mark or label. North  and South differed so conspicuously not only in their social organization  but in every habit of life and thought that neither would tamely bear to  be engulfed in a union in which the other was to be predominant. To keep  an even balance between them was long the principal effort of American  statesmanship. That effort began in the Convention which framed the  Constitution. It did not cease till the very eve of the Civil War.    The problem with which the Convention had to deal was defined within  certain well-understood limits. No one proposed that Slavery should be  abolished by Federal enactment. It was universally acknowledged that  Slavery within a State, however much of an evil it might be, was an evil  with which State authority alone had a right to deal. On the other hand,  no one proposed to make Slavery a national institution. Indeed, all the  most eminent Southern statesmen of that time, and probably the great  majority of Southerners, regarded it as a reproach, and sincerely hoped  that it would soon disappear. There remained, however, certain definite  subjects of dispute concerning which an agreement had to be reached if  the States were to live in peace in the same household.    First, not perhaps in historic importance, but in the insistence of its  demand for an immediate settlement, was the question of representation.  It had been agreed that in the House of Representatives and in the  Electoral College this should be proportionate to population. The urgent  question at once arose: should free white citizens only be counted, or  should the count include the Negro slaves? When it is remembered that  these latter numbered something like half the population of the Southern  States, the immediate political importance of the issue will at once be  recognized. If they were omitted the weight of the South in the  Federation would be halved. In the opposite alternative it would be  doubled. By the compromise eventually adopted it was agreed that the  whole white population should be counted and three-fifths of the slaves.    The second problem was this: if Slavery was to be legal in one State and  illegal in another, what was to be the status of a slave escaping from a  Slave State into a free? Was such an act to be tantamount to an  emancipation? If such were to be the case, it was obvious that slave  property, especially in the border States, would become an"]]]
