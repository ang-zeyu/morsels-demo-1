Fortunately the  report that several had been killed was untrue, but about sixteen men  had been injured, and several of them quite seriously.    There were many speculations concerning what had started the  explosions. It was proved that the first had occurred in one of the  cars which was standing loaded on the railroad track, while the second  explosion had come less than a minute later from what was known as  Storehouse No. 3. Then had followed an explosion at Storehouse No. 2,  and after that the explosions had come so rapidly and there had been  so much excitement that no one could tell exactly what had happened  next. But fortunately the explosions had been confined to the  storehouses and the loaded cars on the track. The main building of the  shell-loading plant had suffered considerably, but a portion was still  standing, and some underground vaults, filled with high explosives,  had not been reached. Had these explosives gone up, it is more than  likely Haven Point, as well as Clearwater Hall and possibly Colby  Hall, would have been shaken to their foundations and with great loss  of life.    A rigid investigation had been started by three different parties--the  owners of the plant, the local authorities, and the Secret Service of  the national government. The Secret Service men, of course, made no  public report, but the others in authority came to the conclusion that  the explosions had been started either by some spies working for the  shell-loading plant or by two suspicious-looking men who had been seen  several times around the place--the same fellows described by Jed  Kessler.    \"Maybe those two fellows on the outside had confederates on the  inside,\" remarked Jack, in talking the affair over with his cousins.    \"More than likely that's the truth of it,\" said Randy. \"Those fellows  often work in gangs.\"    During the days following the victory over Hixley High, a number of  the cadets had gone down to Haven Point at various times, and several  brought back the report that they had met Slugger Brown and Nappy  Martell driving through the town in their runabout. Slugger and Nappy  had put on a lordly air, bowing very condescendingly to those they  knew, but refusing to stop for any conversation.    \"Those fellows make me weary in the bones,\" was the way Dan Soppinger  expressed himself. \"What ever brought 'em to Haven Point? If I had  been fired out of the school the way they were, I wouldn't want to  show my face around here again.\"    \"Yes, Dan; but you aren't the sort they are,\" declared Jack. \"I don't  believe either Slugger Brown or Nappy Martell has a particle of real  pride. They think just because they have a little more spending money  than most fellows, they can lord it over anybody.\"    It worried all of the Rovers to think that Brown and Martell were  hanging around Haven Point, and Jack telephoned to Clearwater Hall  several times, calling up Ruth and also his sister Martha, asking if  they had been annoyed in any way by the pair.    \"We saw them again down near our boathouse,\" said Ruth over the  telephone. \"They acted as if they wanted to talk to us, but we did not  give them any chance to do it.\"    \"If they dare to say a word to any of you, just let us know and we'll  take care of them,\" declared the oldest Rover boy.    On the third day came a long letter to Jack and an equally lengthy  communication for Fred. The letters were from their fathers, and in  them Dick and Sam Rover gave the particulars of how they had  volunteered for service in France and how Dick had been commissioned a  captain and Sam a lieutenant. They mentioned the fact that they were  soon to leave New York City, along with a number of other volunteers,  to go to Camp Huxwell, a beautiful site selected by the government and  located on the Atlantic coast.    \"Why, say, that isn't very far from here!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I've often  heard them talk about that place.\"    Jack's father also mentioned the fact that Colonel Colby had obtained  a commission as a captain and that a great many others of his old  school chums from Putnam Hall, and likewise two of his comrades from  Brill College, were going. He added that if Jack wanted to come home  to see him off, he could do so.    \"And that's just what my dad says, too,\" said Fred, after both boys  had finished reading the letters. \"Of course we'll go!\"    \"Ten horses couldn't hold me back,\" answered Jack.    \"Well, if you fellows go, we're going, too,\" declared Randy, when the  matter was talked over.    \"Bet your life!\" added Andy slangily. \"I want to know what dad has got  to say about all this.\"    Jack and Fred communicated at once with their sisters, and learned  that they, too, had received letters from home and were going to  depart for New York City at the earliest possible moment. It was then  arranged that the young folks should all leave together on the  following morning.    \"Remember me to your fathers,\" said Colonel Colby, after they had  asked for and received permission to go. \"Tell them they will hear  from me very shortly.\"    The two girls met the four boys at Haven Point, and Ruth, May, Gif,  and Spouter came to see them off.    \"I've got a surprise for you,\" said Spouter, who had come to the  railroad station at Haven Point earlier than the others, in order to  obtain parlor-car seats for the party.    \"What is that?\" questioned Fred.    \"When I came in for the seats, who do you think was just ahead of me  at the ticket window?\"    \"You don't mean Slugger and Nappy?\" questioned Randy quickly.    \"You've struck it!\"    \"What were they doing there?\" asked Jack with interest.    \"They were getting tickets for New York.\"    \"Oh, dear! do you mean to say we've got to put up with those fellows  on this trip?\" sighed Martha.    \"You won't have to notice them, Martha,\" declared her brother.    \"Don't worry but what we'll make them keep their distance,\" added  Fred.    The whole crowd looked around the depot, and presently made out  Slugger and Nappy at the far end of the platform. They were smoking  cigarettes and talking in low, earnest tones.    \"I hope they didn't get seats in the parlor car,\" said Mary.    \"I don't think they did,\" answered Spouter. \"They're such smokers, I  guess they'd just as lief hang out in the smoking car.\"    In a few minutes the train came along, and, bidding their friends  good-bye, the Rovers got aboard and had a porter show them to their  seats. From the window Jack waved Ruth a good-bye, and then the long  train pulled out of Haven Point and began its trip to the metropolis.    It was rather a long journey, and it was necessary that they obtain a  meal on the train.    \"Let me go into the dining car and have a look around first,\" remarked  Fred, when it came time to eat.    \"What's the matter--afraid we won't be able to get seats?\" inquired  Randy.    \"I want to see if Slugger and Nappy are around. I don't want to eat  when they do.\"    \"Right you are!\" answered Jack.    He and Fred hurried through the train and into the diner. Neither  Brown nor Martell were present, for which they were thankful. They  found a table for four on one side of the car, with a table for two  directly opposite, and at once engaged both. Then, while Jack held the  tables, Fred hurried back and brought the girls and the twins.    \"I never eat in a dining car but what I think of that fun we had with  Asa Lemm when we first came to the Hall,\" remarked Andy, as they sat  down. \"My, what a pickle we did get that professor in!\" he chuckled,  referring to a series of incidents, the particulars of which were  related in \"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.\"    \"I wonder if we'll ever meet old Asa Lemm again?\" remarked Fred.    \"Sure!\" returned Randy. \"He's like a bad penny--bound to turn up some  time.\"    The young folks ordered soup for a first course, and this was quickly  served. Mary and Martha sat at the larger table with Andy and Randy  opposite, while Fred and Jack occupied the smaller table on the other  side of the car.    The soup was finished and the young folks were waiting to be served  with the more substantial portion of the meal, when suddenly Fred, who  was looking toward the far end of the dining car, pressed his foot  down on that of his cousin.    \"What is it?\" questioned Jack quickly.    \"Here come Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell,\" was the low reply.          CHAPTER XI    TOM ROVER'S DILEMMA      Andy and Randy were facing the same way as Fred, and they, too,  noticed the approach of Brown and Martell. Randy whispered something  in a low tone of voice to Martha and Mary, and the two girls pursed up  their lips, but said nothing, nor did they look around.    The dining car was almost full, and the only table vacant was a small  one directly behind where Fred was sitting. Slugger and Nappy were  conducted to this by the head waiter, thus passing the Rovers. They  did not, however, notice our friends until they had seated themselves  and given their order.    \"Humph! what do you know about that?\" murmured Nappy Martell to his  crony. He was seated where he could stare directly at the two girls.    \"What's the matter?\" returned Slugger Brown, and then turned around to  follow his crony's gaze. \"What do you know about that? I didn't know  they were in such a hurry to get to the diner, did you?\"    \"I knew they would most likely want to eat,\" answered Nappy.    The newcomers winked at each other, and then, while they were waiting  to be served, Nappy began to stare boldly at Martha. But she refused  to look at him, confining her attention to her plate and to Mary and  the twins.    Fred could no longer see the unworthy pair, as they were behind him.  But Jack, looking over his cousin's shoulder, got a good view of how  Martell was staring at his sister, and he also saw how uncomfortable  this was making Martha. He waited a minute or two longer, hoping that  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23319"],[0,"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught (#13)"],[1,"6, showing the diameter of the thread, are marked, and the arcs 5 and 6,  representing the depth of the thread, are marked. The arc 7,  representing the head, is then marked. The vertical lines 8, 9, 10, and  11 are then marked, and the outline of the screw is complete. The thick  lines representing the bottom of the thread are next marked in, as in  Figure 151, extending from line 9 to line 10. Midway between these lines  fine ones are made for the tops of the thread. All the lines being  pencilled in, they may be inked in with the drawing instruments, taking  care that they do not overrun one another. When the pencil lines are  rubbed out, the sketch will appear as in Figure 149.    [Illustration: Fig. 152.]    For a bolt with a hexagon head the lines would be drawn in the order  shown in Figure 152. At a right-angle to centre line 1, line two is  drawn. The pencil-compasses are then set to half the diameter of the  bolt, and from point A arcs 3 and 6 are pencilled, thus showing the  width of the front flat of the head, as well as the diameter of the  stem. From the point where these arcs meet line 2, and with the same  radius, arcs 5 and 6 are marked, showing the widths of the other two  flats of the head. The thickness of the head and the length of the bolt  head may then be marked either by placing a rule on line 1 and marking  the short lines (such as line 7) a cross line 1, or the pencil-compasses  may be set to the rule and the lengths marked from point A. In the  United States standard for bolt heads and nuts the thickness of the head  is made equal to the diameter of the bolt. With the compasses set for  the arcs 3 and 4, we may in two steps, from A along the centre line,  mark off the thickness of the head without using the rule. But as the  rule has to be applied along line 1 to mark line 7 for the length of the  bolt, it is just as easy to mark the head thickness at the same time.  The line 8 showing the length of the thread may be marked at the same  time as the other lengths are marked, and the outlines 9, 10, 11, 12, 13  may be drawn in the order named. We have now to mark the arcs at the top  of the flats of the head to show the chamfer, and to explain how these  arcs are obtained we have in Figure 153 an enlarged view of the head. It  is evident that the smallest diameter of the chamfer is represented by  the circle A, and therefore the length of the line B must equal A. It is  also evident that the outer edge of the chamfer will meet the corners at  an equal depth (from the face of the nut), as represented by the line C  C, and it is obvious that the curves that represent the outline of the  chamfer on each side of the head or nut will approach the face of the  head or nut at an equal distance, as denoted by the line D D. It follows  that the curve must in each case be such as will, at each of its ends,  meet the line C, and at its centre meet the line D D, the centres of the  respective curves being marked in the figure by X.    [Illustration: Fig. 153.]    It is sufficiently accurate, therefore, for all practical purposes to  set the pencil on the centre-line at the point A in Figure 152 and mark  the curve 14, and to then set the compasses by trial to mark the other  two curves of the chamfer, so that they shall be an equal distance with  arc 14 from line 9, and join lines 10 and 13 at the same distance from  line 9 that 14 joins lines 3 and 4, so that as in Figure 153 all three  of the arcs would touch a line as C, and another line as D.

The basis of the Franklin Institute or United States standard for the  heads of bolts and for nuts is as follows:    The short diameter or width across the flats is equal to one and  one-half times the diameter plus 1/8 inch for rough or unfinished bolts  and nuts, and one and one-half times the bolt diameter plus, 1/16 inch  for finished heads and nuts. The thickness is, for rough heads and nuts,  equal to the diameter of the bolt, and for finished heads and nuts 1/16  inch less.    [Illustration: Fig. 155.]    [Illustration: Fig. 156.]    The hexagonal or hexagon (as they are termed in the shop) heads of bolts  may be presented in two ways, as is shown in Figures 155 and 156.    The latter is preferable, inasmuch as it shows the width across the  flats, which is the dimension that is worked to, because it is where the  wrench fits, and therefore of most importance; whereas the latter gives  the length of a flat, which is not worked to, except incidentally, as it  were. There is the objection to the view of the head, given in Figure  156, however, that unless it is accompanied by an end view it somewhat  resembles a similar view of a square head for a bolt. It may be  distinguished therefrom, however, in the following points:    If the amount of chamfer is such as to leave the chamfer circle (as  circle A, in Figure 153) of smaller diameter than the width across the  flats of the bolt-head, the outline of the sides of the head will pass  above the arcs at the top of the flats, and there will be two small flat  places, as A and B, in Figure 156 (representing the angle of the  chamfer), which will not meet the arcs at the top of the flats, but will  join the sides above those arcs, as in the figure; which is also the  case in a similar view of a square-headed bolt. It may be distinguished  therefrom, however, in the following points:    If the amount of chamfer is such as to leave the chamfer circle (A,  Figure 153) of smaller diameter than the width across the flats of the  bolt-head, the outline of the sides will pass above the arc on the  flats, as is shown in Figure 157, in which the chamfer A meets the side  of the head at B, and does not, therefore, meet the arc C. The length of  side lying between B and D in the side view corresponds with the part  lying between E and F in the end view.    [Illustration: Fig. 157.]    If we compare this head with similar views of a square head G, both  being of equal widths, and having their chamfer circles at an equal  distance from the sides of the flats, and at the same angle, we perceive  at once that the amount of chamfer necessary to give the same distance"]]]
