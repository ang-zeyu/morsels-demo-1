BARTLETT,                                    1830.      In the middle bay on the north side of the choir is the monument of Bishop  Bennett (1617), who was buried here. He wears a close black cap, and the  rochet and his feet are resting on a lion. Across his tomb one gets a fine  view of the Norman double arches of the triforium stage on the other side  of the choir.    In the north wall of the north choir aisle in the first of the series of  arched recesses, of Decorated character, with floral ornament in the  mouldings, is an effigy assigned to Bishop Geoffrey de Cliva (died 1120),  and in the same bay of the choir as Bishop Bennett's tomb is the effigy of  a bishop, fully vested, holding the model of a tower. It is assigned to  Bishop Giles De Braose (died 1215), who was erroneously thought to have  been the builder of the western tower (which fell in 1786). This effigy  belongs to the Perpendicular period, when a number of memorials were  erected to earlier bishops.    In the calendar of the ancient missal \"_Secundum usum Herefordensem_,\"  previously quoted, occurs the following entry:--\"_XV. Kal. Decem. Obitus  pie memorie Egidii de Breusa Herefordensis Episcopi, qui inter cetera bona  decimas omnium molendinorum maneriorium suorum Herefordensi Ecclesie  contulit, et per cartam quam a Domino Rege Johanne acquisivit omnes  homines sui ab exactionibus vicecomitum liberantur._\"    In the easternmost bay on the north of the choir is the effigy of Bishop  Stanbury, provost of Eton and builder of the chantry already described. It  is a fine alabaster effigy with accompanying figures. The bishop wears  alb, stole, and chasuble.    Beyond the entrance to Bishop Stanbury's Chantry is a Perpendicular effigy  under an arch which is assigned to Bishop Richard de Capella (died 1127).    On the chancel floor is a very good brass to Bishop Trilleck (died 1360).    In the north-east transept are the following antiquarian remains:--Two  altar-stones, nearly perfect, whereon are placed:--    Six mutilated effigies of unknown lay persons, probably buried in or near  the Magdalen Chapels, but dug up on the south side of the Bishop's  Cloisters, A.D. 1820, and brought inside the cathedral A.D. 1862.    Two matrices of brasses; also a small one on the wall.    The wooden pulpit--very late Perpendicular work from which every canon on  his appointment formerly had to preach forty sermons on forty different  days in succession.    We may also notice two rich pieces of iron-work from Sir A. Denton's tomb:  the head of a knight or templar's effigy and several heraldic shields from  monuments in the cathedral--especially seven in alabaster now placed  against the east wall.           [Illustration: COMPARTMENT OF CHOIR, EXTERIOR, NORTH SIDE.]                   COMPARTMENT OF CHOIR, EXTERIOR, NORTH SIDE.      *The Choir*, with its details of architecture and its individual  accessories, is very beautiful, notwithstanding an unusual deficiency of  light, caused by the position of the transepts, which practically  intercept all light except that from the clerestory. It consists of three  lofty Norman bays of three stages. The middle of the three stages has some  exquisite dwarfed Norman arches with no triforium passages; but there is  one in the upper stage, with slender and graceful Early English arches and  stained glass at back. The vaulting is also Early English, and dates from  about the middle of the thirteenth century.           [Illustration: COMPARTMENT OF CHOIR, INTERIOR, NORTH SIDE.]                   COMPARTMENT OF CHOIR, INTERIOR, NORTH SIDE.      The principal arches of the choir are supported by massive piers with  square bases. The shafts are semi-detached and bear capitals enriched with  foliated and grotesque ornament. In each bay on the triforium level a wide  Norman arch envelops two smaller arches, supported by semi-circular piers  on each side.    A richly carved square-string course runs along the base of the triforium.    The east end of the choir was covered before 1841 by the \"Grecian\" screen,  a wooden erection placed there by Bishop Bisse in 1717, and above it a  Decorated window containing a stained glass representation of the Last  Supper after the picture by Benjamin West. The improvement effected by the  removal of this screen with its heterogeneous appendages was immense. The  great Norman arch was once more exposed to view; and, in place of the  Decorated window, we now have three lancets at the back of the clerestory  passage.    In describing the discoveries led up to by the removal of the old screen,  Dean Merewether says: \"By cautious examination of the parts walled up it  was discovered that the capitals were all perfect, and that this exquisite  and grand construction, the mutilation and concealment of which it is  utterly impossible to account for, was in fact made up of five arches, the  interior and smallest supported by the two semi-columns, and each of the  others increasing in span as it approached the front upon square and  circular shafts alternately, the faces of each arch being beautifully  decorated with the choicest Norman ornaments. Of the four lateral arches,  the two first had been not only hid by the oak panelling of the screen,  but were also, like the two others, closed up with lath and plaster as the  central arch; and when these incumbrances and desecrations were taken away  it is impossible to describe adequately the glorious effect produced,  rendered more solemn and impressive by the appearance of the ancient  monuments of Bishops Reynelm, Mayew, Stanbury, and Benet, whose ashes rest  beneath these massive arches, of which, together with the noble triforium  above, before the Conquest, Athelstan had probably been the founder, and  the former of those just mentioned, the completer and restorer after that  era.\"    The reredos is in Bath stone and marble, and was designed by Mr.  Cottingham, junior, as a memorial to Mr. Joseph Bailey, 1850, who  represented the county for several years in Parliament.    The sculptor was Boulton, and the subject is our Lord's Passion, in five  deep panels occupying canopied compartments divided by small shafts  supporting angels, who carry the instruments of the Passion. The subjects  in the separate panels are:--1. The Agony in the Garden; 2. Christ Bearing  the Cross; 3. The Crucifixion; 4. The Resurrection; and 5. The Three Women  at the Sepulchre.                  [Illustration: EAST END OF THE CHOIR IN 1841.]                          EAST END OF THE CHOIR IN 1841.      Above the reredos a broad spandrel left by two pointed arches springing  from a central pier fills the upper part of the Norman arch. The pier  itself is old, but the upper part is a restoration of Mr. Cottingham's.  The spandrel is covered with modern sculpture, as may be seen in the  illustration. The subject is the Saviour in Majesty, the four evangelists  holding scrolls; and below a figure of King Ethelbert.    An older representation of King Ethelbert is the small effigy on a bracket  against the easternmost pier south of the choir, close to the head of the  tomb of Bishop Mayo, who had desired in his will to be buried by the image  of King Ethelbert. It was dug up about the year 1700 at the entrance to  the Lady Chapel, where it had doubtless been buried in a mutilated  condition when the edict went forth for the destruction of shrines and  images.                  [Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH WINDOW MOULDING.]                          EARLY ENGLISH WINDOW MOULDING.      Originally there were other representations of St. Ethelbert: on the tombs  of Bishops Cantilupe and Mayo, Dean Frowcester, Archdeacon Rudhale,  Praecentor Porter; in colour on the walls of the chapter-house and the tomb  of Joanna de Kilpec; in ancient glass, recently restored, in a window in  the south aisle of the choir; and in a stone-carving over the door of the  Bishop's Cloister, and the effigy formerly on the west front.    Opposite the throne a slab of marble, from designs by Scott, marks the  spot, as far as it is known, where Ethelbert was buried.    *The Choir-stalls* are largely ancient, belonging to the Decorated period.  They have good canopy work, and are otherwise excellent in detail. Some of  the _misereres_ are quaint, among them being found several examples of the  curiously secular subjects chosen for this purpose by the wood-carvers of  the period.    In addition to the bishop's throne, which is of the fourteenth century,  there is, on the north side of the sacrarium, a very old episcopal chair,  concerning which a tradition remains that King Stephen sat in it when he  visited Hereford. Be this as it may, the Hereford chair is undoubtedly of  very great antiquity, and belongs to, or at least is similar to, the  earliest kind of furniture used in this country. The dimensions of the  chair are--height, 3 feet 9 inches; breadth, 33 inches; front to back, 22  inches. The entire chair is formed of 53 pieces, without including the  seat of two boards and the two small circular heads in front.    Traces of ancient colour--vermilion and gold--may still be seen in several  of the narrow bands: a complete list of other painted work which has been  recorded or still exists in the cathedral has been compiled by Mr C. E.  Keyser.(6)    *The Cathedral Library.*--The Archive Chamber, on the Library. This room,  which has been restored by Sir G. G. Scott, is now approached by a winding  stone staircase.    In earlier times access was only obtainable either by a draw-bridge or  some other movable appliance crossing the great north window. The Library  (which Botfield(7) calls \"a most excellent specimen of a genuine monastic  library\") contains about 2000 volumes, including many rare and interesting  manuscripts, most of which are still chained to the shelves. Every chain  is from 3 to 4 feet long, with a ring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#13)"],[1," but there is little doubt that he  found a resting-place in a grave prepared for him in St. Alban's Abbey,  on March 4, 1447. This would be during the time that John Stokes was  Abbot, between the two abbacies of John of Wheathampstead. The body was  discovered in its leaden coffin during the reign of Queen Anne, when  another grave was being dug. The coffin was opened, and the duke's body  was discovered to be in a good state of preservation in the coffin,  which is described as being \"full of pickle.\" It is said that at one  time the vergers would, for a due consideration, allow visitors to carry  away the smaller bones when, owing to the body having been removed from  the preserving fluid, nothing but a skeleton was left.    [Illustration: MONUMENT OF HUMPHREY, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.]    The monument is a handsome one. It was probably erected by  Wheathampstead, who had been on terms of intimacy with the duke, when he  for the second time became Abbot. The canopy over the grave is richly  carved; the antelopes we see on it were the badge of the duke. His  epitaph speaks of him, among other things, as                         Fraudis ineptae      Detector, dum ficta notat miracula caeci.    This refers to the story told of him by Sir Thomas More, how he  convicted an impostor who claimed to have been born blind, but to have  received sight at St. Alban's shrine, by asking him the colour of the  garments that the duke himself and others were wearing; all these  questions were correctly answered by the beggar, who forgot for the  moment that one born blind who had only just received his sight, would  not have known the _names_ of the various colours, though he might  distinguish one colour from another. The beggar was punished for his  imposture by being set in the stocks.    This story is introduced into the first scene of the second act; of the  second part of \"Henry VI.,\" a reproduction of a St. Albans legend in  which some students of the play will find an argument for attributing  the play to Francis Bacon, who lived close by and would be likely to  know the stories current in the town.    #The Tower and Bells.#--The ringing loft is reached by a staircase  starting from the door near the north-west corner of the north arm of  the transept. The steps were originally built of Roman bricks, but at  the time of the restoration had fresh treads of stone laid on them, so  that the ascent is an easy one; from this staircase one passes along the  triforium gallery of the western side of the transept, and then up a  staircase in the turret at the north-west angle of the tower to a room  whose floor is above the flat ceiling of the lantern visible from the  floor of the church. The bells are in the next story, and at no great  height above the floor of the ringing loft. In the ringing loft may be  seen boards on which are inscribed records of several memorable sets of  changes that have been rung, with the dates, the number of changes, the  time occupied, which was generally between three and four hours, and the  names of the ringers and the number of the bell that each one pulled.  The peal consists of eight bells; the tenor is in the key of E flat, and  measures 4 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and is calculated to weigh about 28  cwt. The whole peal was originally cast in London by Philip Wightman in  the year 1699; but the second, fifth, and sixth bells were recast in the  middle of the eighteenth century, and the treble in 1845. On the tenor  may be read the following legend: \"Vivos ad coelum, moritu[r]os ad solum  pulsata voco.\" The clock was in great measure reconstructed under Lord  Grimthorpe's direction and fitted with his gravity escapement; it  strikes the quarter chimes on the second, third, fourth, and seventh  bells, and the hours on the tenor. The mechanism of the chimes, which  play at three, six, nine, and twelve o'clock, was remade by Mr. Godman,  of St. Stephen's parish; this mechanism may be described as a kind of  gigantic musical box. A huge cylinder revolves, on which are projecting  pegs of brass, which as the cylinder goes round catch against wooden  levers which raise clappers that in their fall strike the bells. The  same tune is played all through each day, but a different tune is played  each day of the week; at the end of the week the barrel is automatically  set so as to begin the series of tunes again. There is, moreover,  another tune--the Trinity hymn--which can be set by hand, and this is  used on the greater festivals.    Besides the peal of eight the sacring bell which once hung near the high  altar is now hung in the tower.    It may be well to finish the description of the church with a few notes  about the material used and the method of building, abbreviated from a  paper by Mr. James Neale. He says that during the restoration many  examples were found of lead dowels in the joints of detached shafts.  Sinkings were cut in the upper surface of the lower stone and in the  lower surface of the upper, so that when in place these sinkings would  be opposite to each other; a small hole one-eighth inch in diameter was  then bored in the upper stone, through which lead was poured into the  sinkings. The mortar used between the outer stones of the  fourteenth-century bays of the nave was mixed with oyster-shells,  contained a large amount of lime, and was very hard. There is much  clunch stone used in the interior and this is in a good state of  preservation, but any that has been used externally has decayed. The  abaci of the Early English capitals in the main arcade are of Barnack  stone, which is harder than clunch and so more suitable for bearing a  weight. The Norman stonework was cut with an axe, the Transition with a  chisel. The Early English is bolster-tooled; the Decorated ashlar  (including the bays on the south side of the nave) is claw-tooled, the  mouldings being scraped; the Perpendicular is finely scraped.    [Illustration: SOUTH CHOIR AISLE.]          CHAPTER IV.    THE HISTORY OF THE MONASTERY AND SEE.      Although, as stated in Chapter I., Albanus suffered martyrdom in 303  A.D., and a small church was soon afterwards built over his grave, and  another of larger size subsequently erected, it was not until the eighth  century that the monastery was founded.    The foundation was an act of atonement on the part of Offa II., King of  the Mercians, in the year 793. In the previous year he had been at the  court of Ethelbert, King of East Anglia, and was a suitor for the hand  of his daughter. But he treacherously murdered his host and took  possession of his kingdom. Either as a politic effort to remove the evil  reputation of such deeds, or as a conscientious offering to regain the  favour of Heaven by means of a great work for the Church, Offa resolved  to found a monastery, in honour of the protomartyr of Britain, upon the  site of the martyrdom. The first thing to do was to discover the actual  remains of St. Alban. The story of the discovery would not be complete  without a vision and a miracle. Accordingly a vision is said to have  appeared to the King at Bath, and a miraculous light to have guided him  to the spot where the coffin was found. This had been purposely removed  from its first resting-place within the walls of the church, for fear of  its being desecrated by the Saxons, who certainly did reduce the  building almost to a ruin. The coffin was found to contain the body of  the martyr, as well as the precious relics which had been placed within  it by the Bishop of Auxerre. Their presence establishes the identity of  the remains. The church was then repaired so as to be able to preserve  safely the reliquary which contained the precious relics \"until a more  worthy edifice should be built.\" Permission to build and endow the  monastery was obtained from Pope Adrian I., the King making a special  journey to Rome in order to procure it. The martyr was canonized at the  same time. At some later time a valuable concession was granted to the  new monastery: the tribute known as Peter's Pence being assigned to it,  while the lands belonging to the Abbey were exempted from the payment.  This grant applied to the whole of Offa's kingdom. The payment of  Peter's Pence had only been instituted sixty-six years previously, the  object being to maintain a Saxon college at Rome. Offa lived to see the  monastery established and partially endowed. He himself gave one of the  royal manors to the endowment, but he did not live long enough even to  make a beginning of the grand church he appears to have had in  contemplation, for he died not long after his return from Rome, some  authorities giving the year 794 as the date of his death, others 796.    The monastery was of the Benedictine order. Though it became important,  and at last the chief of the Benedictine houses in England, it was not  one of the earliest. The Benedictine order had been introduced into  England in 596, and forty-five monasteries had been founded before that  of St. Alban's. Many of these were little more than cells, and many were  afterwards absorbed into the larger establishments. Yet several very  famous abbeys were founded at least a century before Offa founded St.  Alban's.    Many of the early Abbots of St. Albans were men of mark and of influence  in the national councils, and some of them were closely related to the  royal family. The Chronicles, however, tell us but little of them,  except when the Abbey itself is concerned. Some notes on the Abbots will  now be given.    1. #Willegod# (793-796). His rule, we are told, was short but prudent.  His death is attributed to vexation at not being able to obtain the body  of Offa for burial in the Abbey. He died two months after the King. The  chronicler charitably hopes that Offa's name is written in the book of  life, although his mortal remains are not honourably preserved. Offa's  son and successor, Ecgfrid, confirmed his father's charter and gave"]]]
