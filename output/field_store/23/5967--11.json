Thus there can be hardly a doubt that immediately preceding the  critical epoch the moon originated from the earth in the way we have  described. Note also that this condition, being one of maximum energy,  was necessarily of dynamical instability, it could not last; the moon  must adopt either of two courses--it must tumble back on the earth, or  it must start outwards. Now which course was the moon to adopt? The  case is analogous to that of an egg standing on its end--it will  inevitably tumble one way or the other. Some infinitesimal cause will  produce a tendency towards one side, and to that side accordingly the  egg will fall. The earth-moon system was similarly in an unstable  state, an infinitesimal cause might conceivably decide the fate of the  system. We are necessarily in ignorance of what the determining cause  might have been, but the effect it produced is perfectly clear; the  moon did not again return to its mother earth, but set out on that  mighty career which is in progress to-day.    Let it be noted that these critical epochs in the earth-moon history  arise when and only when there is an absolute identity between the  length of the month and the length of the day. It may be proper  therefore that I should provide a demonstration of the fact, that the  identity between these two periods must necessarily have occurred at a  very early period in the evolution.    The law of Kepler, which asserts that the square of the periodic time  is proportioned to the cube of the mean distance, is in its ordinary  application confined to a comparison between the revolutions of the  several planets about the sun. The periodic time of each planet is  connected with its average distance by this law; but there is another  application of Kepler's law which gives us information of the distance  and the period of the moon in former stages of the earth-moon history.  Although the actual path of the moon is of course an ellipse, yet that  ellipse is troubled, as is well known, by many disturbing forces, and  from this cause alone the actual path of the moon is far from being  any of those simple curves with which we are so well acquainted. Even  were the earth and the moon absolutely rigid particles, perturbations  would work all sorts of small changes in the pliant curve. The  phenomena of tidal evolution impart an additional element of  complexity into the actual shape of the moon's path. We now see that  the ellipse is not merely subject to incessant deflections of a  periodic nature, it also undergoes a gradual contraction as we look  back through time past; but we may, with all needful accuracy for our  present purpose, think of the path of the moon as a circle, only we  must attribute to that circle a continuous contraction of its radius  the further and the further we look back. The alteration in the  radius will be even so slow, that the moon will accomplish thousands  of revolutions around the earth without any appreciable alteration in  the average distance of the two bodies. We can therefore think of the  moon as revolving at every epoch in a circle of special radius, and as  accomplishing that revolution in a special time. With this  understanding we can now apply Kepler's law to the several stages of  the moon's past history. The periodic time of each revolution, and the  mean distance at which that revolution was performed, will be always  connected together by the formula of Kepler. Thus to take an instance  in the very remote past. Let us suppose that the moon was at one  hundred and twenty thousand miles instead of two hundred and forty  thousand, that is, at half its present distance. Applying the law of  Kepler, we see that the time of revolution must then have been only  about ten days instead of the twenty-seven it is now. Still further,  let us suppose that the moon revolves in an orbit with one-tenth of  the diameter it has at present, then the cube of 10 being 1000, and  the square root of 1000 being 31.6, it follows that the month must  have been less than the thirty-first part of what it is at present,  that is, it must have been considerably less than one of our present  days. Thus you see the month is growing shorter and shorter the  further we look back, the day is also growing shorter and shorter; but  still I think we can show that there must have been a time when the  month will have been at least as short as the day. For let us take the  most extreme case in which the moon shall have made the closest  possible approximation to the earth. Two globes in contact will have a  distance between their centres which is equal to the sum of their  radii. Take the earth as having a radius of four thousand miles, and  the moon a radius of one thousand miles, the two centres must at their  shortest distance be five thousand miles apart, that is, the moon must  then be at the forty-eighth part of its present distance from the  earth. Now the cube of 48 is 110,592, and the square root of 110,592  is nearly 333, therefore the length of the month will be one-three  hundred and thirty-third part of the duration of the month at present;  in other words, the moon must revolve around the earth in a period of  somewhat about two hours. It seems impossible that the day can ever  have been as brief as this. We have therefore proved that, in the  course of its contracting duration, the moon must have overtaken the  contracting day, and that therefore there must have been a time when  the moon was in the vicinity of the earth, and having a day and month  of equal period. Thus we have shown that the critical condition of  dynamical instability must have occurred in the early period of the  earth-moon history, if the agents then in operation were those which  we now know. The further development of the subject must be postponed  until the next lecture.          LECTURE II.      Starting from that fitting commencement of earth-moon history which  the critical epoch affords, we shall now describe the dynamical  phenomena as the tidal evolution progressed. The moon and the earth  initially moved as a solid body, each bending the same face towards  the other; but as the moon retreated, and as tides began to be raised  on the earth, the length of the day began to increase, as did also the  length of the month. We know, however, that the month increased more  rapidly than the day, so that a time was reached when the month was  twice as long as the day; and still both periods kept on increasing,  but not at equal rates, for in progress of time the month grew so much  more rapidly than the day, that many days had to elapse while the moon  accomplished a single revolution. It is, however, only necessary for  us to note those stages of the mighty progress which correspond to  special events. The first of such stages was attained when the month  assumed its maximum ratio to the day. At this time, the month was  about twenty-nine days, and the epoch appears to have occurred at a  comparatively recent date if we use such standards of time as tidal  evolution requires; though measured by historical standards, the epoch  is of incalculable antiquity. I cannot impress upon you too often the  enormous magnitude of the period of time which these phenomena have  required for their evolution. Professor Darwin's theory affords but  little information on this point, and the utmost we can do is to  assign a minor limit to the period through which tidal evolution has  been in progress. It is certain that the birth of the moon must have  occurred at least fifty million years ago, but probably the true  period is enormously greater than this. If indeed we choose to add a  cipher or two to the figure just printed, I do not think there is  anything which could tell us that we have over-estimated the mark.  Therefore, when I speak of the epoch in which the month possessed the  greatest number of days as a recent one, it must be understood that I  am merely speaking of events in relation to the order of tidal  evolution. Viewed from this standpoint, we can show that the epoch is  a recent one in the following manner. At present the month consists of  a little more than twenty-seven days, but at this maximum period to  which I have referred the month was about twenty-nine days; from that  it began to decline, and the decline cannot have proceeded very far,  for even still there are only two days less in the month than at the  time when the month had the greatest number of days. It thus follows  that the present epoch--the human epoch, as we may call it--in the  history of the earth has fallen at a time when the progress of tidal  evolution is about half-way between the initial and the final stage. I  do not mean half-way in the sense of actual measurement of years;  indeed, from this point it would seem that we cannot yet be nearly  half-way, for, vast as are the periods of time that have elapsed since  the moon first took its departure from the earth, they fall far short  of that awful period of time which will intervene between the present  moment and the hour when the next critical state of earth-moon  history shall have been attained. In that state the day is destined  once again to be equal to the month, just as was the case in the  initial stage. The half-way stage will therefore in one sense be that  in which the proportion of the month to the day culminates. This is  the stage which we have but lately passed; and thus it is that at  present we may be said to be almost half-way through the progress of  tidal evolution.    My narrative of the earth-moon evolution must from this point forward  cease to be retrospective. Having begun at that critical moment when  the month and day were first equal, we have traced the progress of  events to the present hour. What we have now to say is therefore a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24263"],[0,"A Hundred Anecdotes of Animals (#13)"],[1,"nce, to obtain a more extensive view of his  range. As the ascent was too fatiguing for the child, he left him on a  small plain at the bottom, with strict injunctions not to stir from it  till his return. Scarcely, however, had he gained the summit, when the  horizon was darkened by an impenetrable mist. The anxious father instantly  hastened back to find his child; but owing to the unusual darkness, he  missed his way. After a fruitless search of many hours, he discovered that  he had reached the bottom of the valley, and was near his own cottage. To  renew the search that night was equally fruitless and dangerous; he was  therefore compelled to go home, although he had lost both his child and  his dog, who had attended him faithfully for many years. Next morning, by  break of day, the shepherd, accompanied by a band of his neighbours, set  out in search of his child; but after a day of fatigue, he was obliged to  return home disappointed. He found that the dog which he had lost the day  before had been to the cottage, and on receiving a piece of cake, had  instantly gone off again. For several successive days the shepherd renewed  the search, and on his return in the evening he found that the dog had  been home, and, on receiving his usual allowance of cake, had instantly  disappeared. Struck with this singular circumstance, he remained at home  one day; and when the dog, as usual, departed with his piece of cake, he  resolved to follow him, and find out the cause of this strange procedure.  The dog led the way to a cataract at some distance from the spot where the  shepherd had left his child. Down a rugged and almost perpendicular  descent the dog began, without hesitation, to make his way, and at last  disappeared by entering into a cave, the mouth of which was almost level  with the torrent. The shepherd with difficulty followed; but, on entering  the cave, what were his emotions, when he beheld his infant eating with  much satisfaction the cake which the dog had just brought him, while the  faithful animal stood by, eyeing his young charge with the utmost  complacency! The child had apparently wandered to the brink of the  precipice, and then either fallen or scrambled down till he reached the  cave. The dog had traced him to the spot; and afterwards prevented him  from starving, by giving up to him his own daily allowance. He appears  never to have quitted the child by night or day, except when it was  necessary to go for food; and then he was always seen running at full  speed to and from the cottage.
