Let  heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may be kept so busy that  they will not pay attention to lying words.\"    So the taskmasters who were over the people went out and said to them,  \"This is Pharaoh's order, 'I will no longer give you straw. Go  yourselves, get straw wherever you can find it; but your work shall not  be made less.'\" So the people were scattered over all the land of Egypt  to gather stubble for straw. The taskmasters urged them on, saying, \"You  must finish your daily task just as when there was straw.\" The  overseers of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had put over  them, were also beaten and asked, \"Why have you not finished to-day as  many bricks as yesterday?\"    Then the overseers of the Israelites went to Pharaoh and said, \"Why do  you deal in this way with your servants? No straw is given to your  servants, and yet they say to us, 'Make bricks.' See how your servants  are beaten and how you wrong your people.\" But he said, \"You are lazy,  you are lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go and offer a sacrifice to  Jehovah.' Now go and work, for no straw shall be given you; yet you must  make the same number of bricks.\"    Then Moses turned again to Jehovah and said, \"Jehovah, why hast thou  brought misfortune upon this people? Why is it that thou has sent me?  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name he has wronged this  people, and thou hast done nothing at all to rescue thy people.\"    Jehovah answered Moses, \"Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh;  for compelled by a mighty power he shall surely let them go, and  compelled by a mighty power he shall drive them out of his land.\"      THE COST OF BEING CRUEL AND STUBBORN    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Pharaoh is stubborn; he will not let the  people go. Go to Pharaoh early in the morning, as he is going out on the  water, and stand by the bank of the Nile to meet him. Say to him,  'Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you with this command:  Let my people go that they may worship me in the wilderness, but so far  you have not listened. Jehovah declares, By this you shall know that I  am Jehovah: See, I will strike the waters which are in the river with  the rod that is in my hand and they shall be changed into blood. The  fish, too, that are in the Nile shall die, and the Nile shall become  foul, so that the Egyptians will hate to drink its water.'\"    Then Moses lifted up the staff and in the presence of Pharaoh and his  servants struck the waters that were in the river Nile; and all its  waters were changed into blood. The fish, too, that were in the Nile  died, and the river became so foul that the Egyptians could not drink  its water, but dug round about the Nile for water to drink.    Seven days later Jehovah gave this command to Moses, \"Go in to Pharaoh  and say to him, 'Jehovah commands: Let my people go that they may  worship me. If you refuse to let them go, then I will afflict all your  land with frogs; and the Nile shall swarm with frogs which shall go up  and come into your house, into your sleeping chamber, upon your bed,  into the houses of your servants, upon your people, and into your ovens  and kneading-troughs; and the frogs shall come up even upon you and your  people and all your servants.'\"    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Say to Aaron: 'Stretch out your hand with  your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and  cause frogs to come up over the land of Egypt.'\" So Aaron stretched out  his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the  land of Egypt.    Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, \"Pray to Jehovah to  take away the frogs from me and my people; then I will let the people  go, that they may offer a sacrifice to Jehovah.\" Moses said to Pharaoh,  \"Will you do yourself the honor of telling me at what time I shall pray  to Jehovah in your behalf and in behalf of your servants and people,  that the frogs be destroyed from your palaces and be left only in the  Nile?\" Pharaoh answered, \"To-morrow.\" Then Moses said, \"Let it be as you  say; that you may know that there is none like Jehovah our God, the  frogs shall depart from you, from your palaces, and from your servants  and people; they shall be left only in the Nile.\"    When Moses and Aaron had gone out from Pharaoh, Moses prayed to Jehovah  to remove the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh; and Jehovah did  as Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courts, and in the  fields, and the people gathered them together in many heaps; and the  land was filled with a vile odor. But when Pharaoh saw that relief had  come, he was stubborn and, as Jehovah had said, did not listen to Moses  and Aaron.    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Get up early in the morning and stand  before Pharaoh, just as he goes out to the water, and say to him,  'Jehovah commands: Let my people go that they may worship me. If you  will not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies upon you, upon  your servants, and upon your people and into your palaces, so that the  houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, as well as the  ground upon which they stand. But at that time I will set apart the land  of Goshen in which my people live, and no swarms of flies shall be  there, so that you may know that I, Jehovah, am in the midst of the  earth.'\"    And Jehovah did so: a vast swarm of flies came upon Pharaoh's palace and  into the homes of his servants; and all the land of Egypt was ruined by  the swarms of flies.    Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, \"I will let you go  that you may offer a sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness;  only you must not go far away. Pray for me.\" Moses replied, \"I will go  out and will pray to Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from  Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people to-morrow; only let not  Pharaoh again act deceitfully by refusing to let the people go to offer  a sacrifice to Jehovah.\"    So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Jehovah. And Jehovah did as  Moses asked; but this time also Pharaoh was stubborn and would not let  the people go.    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'Jehovah the  God of the Hebrews commands: Let my people go that they may worship me.  For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them, then the power of  Jehovah will bring a very severe pest upon your cattle which are in the  field, upon the horses, the asses, the camels, the herds, and the  flocks. But Jehovah will make a difference between the cattle of Israel  and the cattle of Egypt, and not one that belongs to the Israelites  shall die.'\"    So Jehovah set a fixed time, saying, \"To-morrow Jehovah will do this in  the land.\" Jehovah did this on the next day, and all the cattle of the  Egyptians died; but none of the cattle of the Israelites. Then Pharaoh  sent and found that not even one of the cattle of the Israelites was  dead; but Pharaoh was stubborn and would not let the people go.    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Get up early in the morning and stand  before Pharaoh, and say to him,'Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews,  commands: Let my people go, that they may worship me. Do you still set  yourself against my people, so that you will not let them go? To-morrow  about this time I will send down a very heavy fall of hail, such as has  not been in Egypt from the day that it became a nation until now.'\"    So Jehovah sent down hail upon the land of Egypt, and the lightning  flashing in the midst of the hail was very severe, such as had not been  before in all Egypt since it became a nation. Through the whole land of  Egypt the hail struck down everything that was in the field, both man  and beast. The hail also struck down all the growing plants and broke  all the trees in the fields. Only in the land of Goshen, where the  Israelites were, there was no hail.    Again Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said to them, \"I  have sinned this time; Jehovah is right and I and my people are wrong.  Pray to Jehovah, for there has been enough of these mighty thunderings  and hail, and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.\" Moses  said to him, \"As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out  my hands in prayer to Jehovah; the thunders shall stop, and there shall  be no more hail, that you may know that the earth is Jehovah's. But as  for you and your servants, I know that even then you will not fear  Jehovah.\"    So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to  Jehovah; and the thunders and hail stopped, and the rain was no longer  poured upon the earth. But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail  and the thunders had stopped, he sinned again, and he and his servants  became stubborn, and he would not let the Israelites go.    So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and said to him, \"Jehovah, the God  of the Hebrews, commands: 'How long will you refuse to obey me? Let my  people go that they may worship me. For if you refuse to let my people  go, then to-morrow I will bring locusts into your land, and they will  cover the surface of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the  ground, and they shall eat the rest of that which is left to you from  the hail, and they shall eat all your trees which grow in the field.'\"    Then Moses and Aaron were driven out from Pharaoh's presence, but Moses  stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah caused an  east wind to blow over the land all that day and night. In the morning  the east wind brought the locusts, and they went over all the land of  Egypt and settled down in all the land of Egypt, a very large swarm,  more locusts than there ever were before or ever will be again. For they  covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#13)"],[1,"with all commonly received views upon the subject. I come  before you, professedly to speak of things forgotten or things disputed;  and I lay before you, not accepted principles, but questions at issue.  Of those questions you are to be the judges, and to you I appeal. You  must not, when you leave this room, if you feel doubtful of the truth of  what I have said, refer yourselves to some architect of established  reputation, and ask him whether I am right or not. You might as well,  had you lived in the sixteenth century, have asked a Roman Catholic  archbishop his opinion of the first reformer. I deny his jurisdiction;  I refuse his decision. I call upon you to be Bereans in architecture, as  you are in religion, and to search into these things for yourselves.  Remember that, however candid a man may be, it is too much to expect of  him when his career in life has been successful, to turn suddenly on the  highway, and to declare that all he has learned has been false, and all  he has done, worthless; yet nothing less than such a declaration as this  must be made by nearly every existing architect, before he admitted the  truth of one word that I have said to you this evening. You must be  prepared, therefore, to hear my opinions attacked with all the virulence  of established interest, and all the pertinacity of confirmed prejudice;  you will hear them made the subjects of every species of satire and  invective; but one kind of opposition to them you will never hear; you  will never hear them met by quiet, steady, rational argument; for that  is the one way in which they _cannot_ be met. You will constantly hear  me accused--you yourselves may be the first to accuse me--of presumption  in speaking thus confidently against the established authority of ages.  Presumption! Yes, if I had spoken on my own authority; but I have  appealed to two incontrovertible and irrefragable witnesses--to the  nature that is around you--to the reason that is within you. And if you  are willing in this matter to take the voice of authority _against_ that  of nature and of reason, take it in other things also. Take it in  religion, as you do in architecture. It is not by a Scottish  audience--not by the descendants of the Reformer and the  Covenanter--that I expected to be met with a refusal to believe that the  world might possibly have been wrong for _three_ hundred years, in their  ways of carving stones and setting up of pillars, when they know that  they were wrong for _twelve_ hundred years, in their marking how the  roads divided, that led to Hell and Heaven.    55. You must expect at first that there will be difficulties and  inconsistencies in carrying out the new style; but they will soon be  conquered if you attempt not too much at once. Do not be afraid of  incongruities--do not think of unities of effect. Introduce your Gothic  line by line and stone by stone; never mind mixing it with your present  architecture; your existing houses will be none the worse for having  little bits of better work fitted to them; build a porch, or point a  window, if you can do nothing else; and remember that it is the glory of  Gothic architecture that it can do _anything_. Whatever you really and  seriously want, Gothic will do for you; but it must be an _earnest_  want. It is its pride to accommodate itself to your needs; and the one  general law under which it acts is simply this,--find out what will make  you comfortable, build that in the strongest and boldest way, and then  set your fancy free in the decoration of it. Don't do anything to  imitate this cathedral or that, however beautiful. Do what is  convenient; and if the form be a new one, so much the better; then set  your mason's wits to work, to find out some new way of treating it. Only  be steadily determined that, even if you cannot get the best Gothic, at  least you will have no Greek; and in a few years' time--in less time  than you could learn a new science or a new language thoroughly--the  whole art of your native country will be reanimated.    56. And, now, lastly. When this shall be accomplished, do not think it  will make little difference to you, and that you will be little the  happier, or little the better for it. You have at present no conception,  and can have none, how much you would enjoy a truly beautiful  architecture; but I can give you a proof of it which none of you will be  able to deny. You will all assuredly admit this principle,--that  whatever temporal things are spoken of in the Bible as emblems of the  highest spiritual blessings, must be _good things_ in themselves. You  would allow that bread, for instance, would not have been used as an  emblem of the word of life, unless it had been good, and necessary for  man; nor water used as the emblem of sanctification, unless it also had  been good and necessary for man. You will allow that oil, and honey, and  balm are good, when David says, \"Let the righteous reprove me; it shall  be an excellent oil;\" or, \"How sweet are thy words unto my taste; yea,  sweeter than honey to my mouth;\" or, when Jeremiah cries out in his  weeping, \"Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there?\" You  would admit at once that the man who said there was no taste in the  literal honey, and no healing in the literal balm, must be of distorted  judgment, since God had used them as emblems of spiritual sweetness and  healing. And how, then, will you evade the conclusion, that there must  be joy, and comfort, and instruction in the literal beauty of  architecture, when God, descending in His utmost love to the distressed  Jerusalem, and addressing to her His most precious and solemn promises,  speaks to her in such words as these: \"Oh, thou afflicted, tossed with  tempest, and not comforted,\"--What shall be done to her?--What brightest  emblem of blessing will God set before her? \"Behold, I will _lay thy  stones with fair colors_, and thy foundations with sapphires; and I will  make thy _windows of agates_, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy  borders of pleasant stones.\" Nor is this merely an emblem of spiritual  blessing; for that blessing is added in the concluding words, \"And all  thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace  of thy children.\"          ADDENDA    TO    LECTURES I. AND II.      57. The delivery of the foregoing lectures excited, as it may be  imagined, considerable indignation among the architects who happened to  hear them, and elicited various attempts at reply. As it seemed to have  been expected by the writers of these replies, that in two lectures,  each of them lasting not much more than an hour, I should have been able  completely to discuss the philosophy and history of the architecture of  the world, besides meeting every objection, and reconciling every  apparent contradiction, which might suggest itself to the minds of  hearers with whom, probably, from first to last, I had not a single  exactly correspondent idea relating to the matters under discussion, it  seems unnecessary to notice any of them in particular. But as this  volume may perhaps fall into the hands of readers who have not time to  refer to the works in which my views have been expressed more at large,  and as I shall now not be able to write or to say anything more about  architecture for some time to come, it may be useful to state here, and  explain in the shortest possible compass, the main gist of the  propositions which I desire to maintain respecting that art; and also to  note and answer, once for all, such arguments as are ordinarily used by  the architects of the modern school to controvert these propositions.  They may be reduced under six heads.    1. That Gothic or Romanesque construction is nobler than Greek  construction.    2. That ornamentation is the principal part of architecture.    3. That ornamentation should be visible.    4. That ornamentation should be natural.    5. That ornamentation should be thoughtful.    6. And that therefore Gothic ornamentation is nobler than Greek  ornamentation, and Gothic architecture the only architecture which  should now be built.    58. Proposition 1st.--_Gothic or Romanesque construction is nobler than  Greek construction._[20] That is to say, building an arch, vault, or  dome, is a nobler and more ingenious work than laying a flat stone or  beam over the space to be covered. It is, for instance, a nobler and  more ingenious thing to build an arched bridge over a stream, than to  lay two pine-trunks across from bank to bank; and, in like manner, it is  a nobler and more ingenious thing to build an arch over a window, door,  or room, than to lay a single flat stone over the same space.    [Footnote 20: The constructive value of Gothic architecture is, however,  far greater than that of Romanesque, as the pointed arch is not only  susceptible of an infinite variety of forms and applications to the  weight to be sustained, but it possesses, in the outline given to its  masonry at its perfect periods, the means of self-sustainment to a far  greater degree than the round arch. I pointed out, for, I believe, the  first time, the meaning and constructive value of the Gothic cusp, in  page 129 of the first volume of the \"Stones of Venice.\" That statement  was first denied, and then taken advantage of, by modern architects; and  considering how often it has been alleged that I have no _practical_  knowledge of architecture, it cannot but be matter of some triumph to  me, to find \"The Builder,\" of the 21st January, 1854, describing as a  new invention, the successful application to a church in Carlow of the  principle which I laid down in the year 1851.]    No architects have ever attempted seriously to controvert this  proposition. Sometimes, however, they say that \"of two ways of doing a  thing, the best and most perfect is not always to be adopted, for there  may be particular reasons for employing an inferior one.\" This I am"]]]
