Parading the men,  he addressed to them another of those fiery speeches for which he was  famous, and the quality of which, from so illiterate a man, is  amazingly high.    He painted anew the dangers before them, and then adroitly lightened  the shadows of his picture by pointing to the rewards.  He appealed to  all that was best in humanity by saying that he wanted none but the  bravest to go forward.[6]    He closed his address by offering to allow all who wished to do so to  return to San Miguel, whose feeble garrison, he said, he should be glad  to have reenforced.  And, with a subtler stroke of policy, he promised  that those who went back should share in the rewards gained by their  more constant brethren.  But four infantrymen and five horsemen  shamefacedly availed themselves of this permission.  The rest  enthusiastically clamored to be led forward.  Both mutiny and timidity  were silenced forever in that band.    {75}    On a similar occasion, Cortes had burnt his ships.  It is hard to  decide which was the better expedient.  Certainly Cortes was  incomparably a much abler man than Pizarro, but somehow Pizarro managed  to rise to the successive emergencies which confronted him, just the  same.    Greatly refreshed in spirits, the army, purged of the malcontents,  proceeded cautiously on its way south.  They were much elated from time  to time at receiving envoys from Atahualpa, who coupled a superstitious  reverence for the invaders as Children of the Sun with demands as to  their purposes, and a request that they halt and wait the pleasure of  the Inca.  Pizarro dissembled his intentions and received them with  fair words, but refusing to halt, kept steadily on, announcing his  intention of visiting Atahualpa wherever he might be found.    Pursuing their journey, the Spaniards came early in November to the  foot of the mountains.  To the right of them, that is toward the south,  extended a great well-paved road which led to the imperial capital of  Cuzco.  In front of them, a narrow path rose over the mountains.  One  was easy, the other hard.  In spite of suggestions from his soldiery,  Pizarro chose the hard way.  He had announced his intention of visiting  the Inca, and visit him he would although the way to the city of Cuzco  was open and the place might easily be taken possession of.  The seat  of danger and the source of power were alike with the Inca, and not in  Cuzco.    With sixty foot and forty horse, this old man, now past sixty years,  led the way over the mountains, while his brother brought up the rear  with the remainder.  The passage was a terrible one, but the  indomitable {76} band, catching some of the spirit of their leader,  surmounted all the obstacles, and a few days after from the summits of  a mighty range, surveyed the fertile, beautiful plains spread out  before them on the farther side of the mountain.  Close at hand was the  white-walled city, Caxamarca or Cajamarca, embowered in verdure in a  fruitful valley.  The place was an important position, well fortified  and containing, under ordinary circumstances, a population of ten  thousand.  The reader should remember the name, for it was the scene of  one of the most remarkable and determinative events in history.  The  conquest, in fact, was settled there.    Beyond the city, on the slopes of the hills, and divided from it by a  river, over which a causeway led, stood the white tents of the fifty  thousand soldiers of Atahualpa's army.  The number of them filled the  Spaniards with amazement, and in some cases with apprehension.  There  was no going back then, however; there was nothing to do but advance.  At the hour when the bells of Holy Church in their home land were  ringing vespers, in a cold driving rain mingled with sleet, the little  cortege entered the city, which they found as the French found Moscow,  deserted of its inhabitants.  With the ready instinct of a soldier,  Pizarro led his force to the public square, or Plaza, which was in the  shape of a rude triangle surrounded on two sides by well-built,  two-story houses of stone.  On the other side, or base, rose a huge  fortress with a tower overlooking the city on one hand and the Inca's  camp on the other.    Without hesitation, the weary Spaniards made themselves at home in the  vacant buildings around the square; guards were posted in order that  the strictest {77} watch might be kept, and other preparations made for  defence.  Here they prepared for the repose of the night.  Meanwhile  Hernando de Soto with twenty horse was sent as an ambassador to  Atahualpa's camp.  He had been gone but a short time when Pizarro, at  the suggestion of his brother Hernando, who made the point that twenty  horsemen were not sufficient for defense and too many to lose,  despatched the latter with twenty more cavalrymen to reenforce the  first party.    The two cavaliers and their escort found the Inca in the midst of his  camp.  The monarch was seated and surrounded by a brilliant assemblage  of nobles in magnificent vestments.  He was guarded by a great army of  soldiers armed with war-clubs, swords and spears of tempered copper,  and bows and slings.  He received the deputation with the impassivity  of a stone image, vouchsafing no answer to their respectful address  until it had been several times repeated.  At last he declared he would  visit the strangers on the morrow, and directed them to occupy the  buildings in the public square, and none other until he came to make  arrangements.  His demeanor was cold and forbidding to the last degree.  The results of the embassy were highly unsatisfactory.  One incident  connected with the interview is worthy of mention.    De Soto, who was a most accomplished cavalier, a perfect centaur in  fact, noticing the amazed and somewhat alarmed glances of the Inca's  men at the movements of his restless horse, suddenly determined to  exhibit his skill at the manege.  Striking spurs to his charger, he  caused him to curvet and prance in the open before the Inca, showing at  the same time {78} his own horsemanship and the fiery impetuosity of  the high-spirited animal.  He concluded this performance--shall I say  circus?--by dashing at full speed toward the Inca, reining in his steed  with the utmost dexterity a few feet from the royal person.  What the  Inca thought of this has not been recorded.  I imagine he must have  been terribly affronted.  Some of his nobles and soldiers, less able to  preserve their iron composure than their master, shrank back from the  onrushing avalanche of steed and steel presented by De Soto and his  horse.  The Spaniards found their dead bodies the next day.  It did not  do to show cowardice in the presence of the Inca!  They had been  summarily executed by Atahualpa's order.  Yet, I cannot think the Inca  a man of surpassing bravery after all.  Certainly he was not a man of  sufficient ability worthily to hold the scepter of so great an empire.  He made a frightful mistake in not stopping the invaders where it would  have been easy for him to do so, in the narrow defiles of the  mountains, and he did not even yet seem to have decided in his own mind  how he should treat them.  To be sure, according to some accounts, he  looked upon them as belonging to the immortal gods, but there have been  men brave enough in the defence of land and liberty to defy even the  immortal gods!  A vast deal of sympathy, indeed, has been wasted upon  Atahualpa.  Without doubt the Spaniards treated him abominably, and for  that treatment the wretched monarch has claims to our consideration,  but for his personal qualities or his past record, none.  Helps  explains his name as derived from two words meaning, \"sweet valor!\"  Markham affirms that the words mean \"A chance, or lucky, game-cock!\"  Neither appellation, in view of {79} Atahualpa's history can be  considered as especially apt or happy.    Much dissatisfied and thoroughly perturbed, De Soto and Hernando  Pizarro returned to the city.  Long and serious were the deliberations  of the leaders that night.  At length they arrived at a momentous  decision, one for which they have been severely and justly censured,  but which under the circumstances was the only possible decision which  insured their safety.  They had no business in that country.  They had  come there with the deliberate intention of looting it without regard  to the rights of the inhabitants, and in that purpose lay the seeds of  all their subsequent crimes, treachery, murder, outrage and all other  abominations whatsoever.  No surprise need be felt therefore, that they  determined upon the seizure of the person of the Inca.  The example of  Cortes with Montezuma was before them.  I have no doubt that his  amazing exploits in Mexico had been talked over frequently by every  camp-fire in the New and the Old World, and many bold spirits had  longed for an opportunity to emulate his doings.  The Spaniards in Peru  had already learned enough of the local conditions to realize that with  the person of the Inca they could control the government.  To seize him  was black treachery, of course; but being there, it was the only thing  to do, from their point of view.  The night was an anxious one and the  morning found them engaged in preparations.  De Candia was posted with  two small falconets and three arquebusiers on the roof of the fortress.  His guns pointed toward the Inca's camp, though he had instructions to  turn them on the square as soon as the Peruvians arrived.  De Soto and  Hernando Pizarro divided the horse {80} between them and occupied the  houses on the other side of the square with them.  The infantry were  distributed at various points of vantage.  Pizarro reserved twenty of  the trustiest blades for his own escort.  The arms of the men were  carefully looked to, and nothing that the skill or experience of the  captains could suggest was left undone to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#13)"],[1,"you?\"    He nodded.    \"On the charge of--murder?\"    He nodded again. She looked at him in silence for some moments.    \"I shall be ready in half an hour,\" she said, and without a word the  detective left the room.    He made his way back to the doctor's sanctum, and found that gentleman  awaiting him impatiently.    \"I say,\" said the doctor, \"that's all bunkum about this girl being wanted  as a witness. I had my doubts and I looked up the Scotland Yard warning  which I received a couple of days ago. She's Odette Rider, and she's  wanted on a charge of murder.\"    \"Got it first time,\" said Tarling, dropping wearily into a chair. \"Do you  mind if I smoke?\"    \"Not a bit,\" said the doctor cheerfully. \"I suppose you're taking her  with you?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"I can't imagine a girl like that committing a murder,\" said Dr.  Saunders. \"She doesn't seem to possess the physique necessary to have  carried out all the etceteras of the crime. I read the particulars in the  _Morning Globe_. The person who murdered Thornton Lyne must have carried  him from his car and laid him on the grass, or wherever he was found--and  that girl couldn't lift a large-sized baby.\"    Tarling jerked his head in agreement.    \"Besides,\" Dr. Saunders went on, \"she hasn't the face of a murderer. I  don't mean to say that because she's pretty she couldn't commit a crime,  but there are certain types of prettiness which have their origin in  spiritual beauty, and Miss Stevens, or Rider, as I suppose I should call  her, is one of that type.\"    \"I'm one with you there,\" said Tarling. \"I am satisfied in my own mind  that she did not commit the crime, but the circumstances are all against  her.\"    The telephone bell jingled, and the doctor took up the receiver and spoke  a few words.    \"A trunk call,\" he said, explaining the delay in receiving acknowledgment  from the other end of the wire.    He spoke again into the receiver and then handed the instrument across  the table to Tarling.    \"It's for you,\" he said. \"I think it is Scotland Yard.\"    Tarling put the receiver to his ear.    \"It is Whiteside,\" said a voice. \"Is that you, Mr. Tarling? We've found  the revolver.\"    \"Where?\" asked Tarling quickly.    \"In the girl's flat,\" came the reply.    Tarling's face fell. But after all, that was nothing unexpected. He had  no doubt in his mind at all that the murder had been committed in Odette  Rider's flat, and, if that theory were accepted, the details were  unimportant, as there was no reason in the world why the pistol should  not be also found near the scene of the crime. In fact, it would have  been remarkable if the weapon had not been discovered on those premises.    \"Where was it?\" he asked.    \"In the lady's work-basket,\" said Whiteside. \"Pushed to the bottom and  covered with a lot of wool and odds and ends of tape.\"    \"What sort of a revolver is it?\" asked Tarling after a pause.    \"A Colt automatic,\" was the reply. \"There were six live cartridges in the  magazine and one in the breach. The pistol had evidently been fired, for  the barrel was foul. We've also found the spent bullet in the fireplace.  Have you found your Miss Stevens?\"    \"Yes,\" said Tarling quietly. \"Miss Stevens is Odette Rider.\"    He heard the other's whistle of surprise.    \"Have you arrested her?\"    \"Not yet,\" said Tarling. \"Will you meet the next train in from Ashford?  I shall be leaving here in half an hour.\"    He hung up the receiver and turned to the doctor.    \"I gather they've found the weapon,\" said the interested medico.    \"Yes,\" replied Tarling, \"they have found the weapon.\"    \"Humph!\" said the doctor, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \"A pretty bad  business.\" He looked at the other curiously. \"What sort of a man was  Thornton Lyne?\" he asked.    Tarling shrugged his shoulders.    \"Not the best of men, I'm afraid,\" he said; \"but even the worst of men  are protected by the law, and the punishment which will fall to the  murderer----\"    \"Or murderess,\" smiled the doctor.    \"Murderer,\" said Tarling shortly. \"The punishment will not be affected by  the character of the dead man.\"    Dr. Saunders puffed steadily at his pipe.    \"It's rum a girl like that being mixed up in a case of this description,\"  he said. \"Most extraordinary.\"    There was a little tap at the door and the matron appeared.    \"Miss Stevens is ready,\" she said, and Tarling rose.    Dr. Saunders rose with him, and, going to a shelf took down a large  ledger, and placing it on his table, opened it and took up a pen.    \"I shall have to mark her discharge,\" he said, turning over the leaves,  and running his finger down the page. \"Here she is--Miss Stevens,  concussion and shock.\"    He looked at the writing under his hand and then lifted his eyes to the  detective.    \"When was this murder committed?\" he asked.    \"On the night of the fourteenth.\"    \"On the night of the fourteenth?\" repeated the doctor thoughtfully. \"At  what time?\"    \"The hour is uncertain,\" said Tarling, impatient and anxious to finish  his conversation with this gossiping surgeon; \"some time after eleven.\"    \"Some time after eleven,\" repeated the doctor. \"It couldn't have been  committed before. When was the man last seen alive?\"    \"At half-past nine,\" said Tarling with a little smile. \"You're not going  in for criminal investigation, are you, doctor?\"    \"Not exactly,\" smiled Saunders. \"Though I am naturally pleased to be in a  position to prove the girl's innocence.\"    \"Prove her innocence? What do you mean?\" demanded Tarling quickly.    \"The murder could not have been committed before eleven o'clock. The dead  man was last seen alive at half-past nine.\"    \"Well?\" said Tarling.    \"Well,\" repeated Dr. Saunders, \"at nine o'clock the boat train left  Charing Cross, and at half-past ten Miss Rider was admitted to this  hospital suffering from shock and concussion.\"    For a moment Tarling said nothing and did nothing. He stood as though  turned to stone, staring at the doctor with open mouth. Then he lurched  forward, gripped the astonished medical man by the hand, and wrung it.    \"That's the best bit of news I have had in my life,\" he said huskily.          CHAPTER XIII    TWO SHOTS IN THE NIGHT      The journey back to London was one the details of which were registered  with photographic realism in Tarling's mind for the rest of his life. The  girl spoke little, and he himself was content to meditate and turn over  in his mind the puzzling circumstances which had surrounded Odette  Rider's flight.    In the very silences which occurred between the interchanges of  conversation was a comradeship and a sympathetic understanding which both  the man and the girl would have found it difficult to define. Was he in  love with her? He was shocked at the possibility of such a catastrophe  overtaking him. Love had never come into his life. It was a hypothetical  condition which he had never even considered. He had known men to fall in  love, just as he had known men to suffer from malaria or yellow fever,  without considering that the same experience might overtake him. A shy,  reticent man, behind that hard mask was a diffidence unsuspected by his  closest friends.    So that the possibility of being in love with Odette Rider disturbed his  mind, because he lacked sufficient conceit to believe that such a passion  could be anything but hopeless. That any woman could love him he could  not conceive. And now her very presence, the fragrant nearness of her, at  once soothed and alarmed him. Here was a detective virtually in charge of  a woman suspected of murder--and he was frightened of her! He knew the  warrant in his pocket would never be executed, and that Scotland Yard  would not proceed with the prosecution, because, though Scotland Yard  makes some big errors, it does not like to have its errors made public.    The journey was all too short, and it was not until the train was running  slowly through a thin fog which had descended on London that he returned  to the subject of the murder, and only then with an effort.    \"I am going to take you to an hotel for the night,\" he said, \"and in the  morning I will ask you to come with me to Scotland Yard to talk to the  Chief.\"    \"Then I am not arrested?\" she smiled.    \"No, I don't think you're arrested.\" He smiled responsively. \"But I'm  afraid that you are going to be asked a number of questions which may be  distressing to you. You see, Miss Rider, your actions have been very  suspicious. You leave for the Continent under an assumed name, and  undoubtedly the murder was committed in your flat.\"    She shivered.    \"Please, please don't talk about that,\" she said in a low voice.    He felt a brute, but he knew that she must undergo an examination at the  hands of men who had less regard for her feelings.    \"I do wish you would be frank with me,\" he pleaded. \"I am sure I could  get you out of all your troubles without any difficulty.\"    \"Mr. Lyne hated me,\" she said. \"I think I touched him on his tenderest  spot--poor man--his vanity. You yourself know how he sent that criminal  to my flat in order to create evidence against me.\"    He nodded.    \"Did you ever meet Stay before?\" he asked.    She shook her head.    \"I think I have heard of him,\" she said. \"I know that Mr. Lyne was  interested in a criminal, and that this criminal worshipped him. Once Mr.  Lyne brought him to the Stores and wanted to give him a job but the man  would not accept it. Mr. Lyne once told me that Sam Stay would do  anything in the world for him.\"    \"Stay thinks you committed the murder,\" said Tarling bluntly. \"Lyne has  evidently told stories about you and your hatred for him, and I really  think that Stay would have been more dangerous to you than the police,  only fortunately the little crook has gone off his head.\"    She looked at him in astonishment.    \"Mad?\" she asked. \"Poor fellow! Has this awful thing driven him ...\"    Tarling nodded.    \"He was taken to the County"]]]
