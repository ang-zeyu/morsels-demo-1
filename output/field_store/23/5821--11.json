He was as ready  as others to use the arts of the theatre for the liturgy of patriots.  One of the most touching of all the minor dramatic incidents of the  Revolution was the death of Barra. This was a child of thirteen who  enrolled himself as a drummer, and marched with the Blues to suppress  the rebel Whites in La Vendee. One day he advanced too close to the  enemy's post, intrepidly beating the charge. He was surrounded, but the  peasant soldiers were loth to strike, 'Cry _Long live the King!_' they  shouted, 'or else death!' 'Long live the Republic!' was the poor little  hero's answer, as a ball pierced his heart. Robespierre described the  incident to the Convention, and amid prodigious enthusiasm demanded that  the body of the young martyr of liberty should be transported to the  Pantheon with special pomp, and that David, the artist of the  Revolution, should be charged with the duty of devising and embellishing  the festival. As it happened, the arrangements were made for the  ceremony to take place on the Tenth of Thermidor--a day on which  Robespierre and all Paris were concerned about a celebration of bloodier  import. Thermidor, however, was still far off; and the red sun of  Jacobin enthusiasm seemed as if it would shine unclouded for ever.    Even at the Jacobins, however, popular as he was, Robespierre felt every  instant the necessity of walking cautiously. He was as far removed as  possible from that position of Dictator which some historians with a  wearisome iteration persist in ascribing to him, even at the moment when  they are enumerating the defeats which the party of Hebert was able to  inflict upon him in the very bosom of the Mother Club itself. They make  him the sanguinary dictator in one sentence, and the humiliated  intriguer in the next. The latter is much the more correct account of  the two, if we choose to call a man an intriguer who was honestly  anxious to suppress what he considered a wicked faction, and yet had  need of some dexterity to keep his own head upon his shoulders.           *       *       *       *       *    In the winter of 1793 the Municipal party, guided by Hebert and  Chaumette, made their memorable attempt to extirpate Christianity in  France. The doctrine of D'Holbach's supper-table had for a short space  the arm of flesh and the sword of the temporal power on its side. It was  the first appearance of dogmatic atheism in Europe as a political force.  This makes it one of the most remarkable moments in the Revolution, just  as it makes the Revolution itself the most remarkable moment in modern  history. The first political demonstration of atheism was attended by  some of the excesses, the folly, the extravagances that stained the  growth of Christianity. On the whole it is a very mild story compared  with the atrocities of the Jewish records or the crimes of Catholicism.  The worst charge against the party of Chaumette is that they were  intolerant, and the charge is deplorably true; but this charge cannot  lie in the mouth of persecuting churches.    Historical recriminations, however, are not very edifying. It is  perfectly fair when Catholics talk of the atheist Terror, to rejoin that  the retainers of Anjou and Montpensier slew more men and women on the  first day of the Saint Bartholomew than perished in Paris through the  Years I. and II. But the retort does us no good beyond the region of  dialectic; it rather brings us down to the level of the poor sectaries  whom it crushes. Let us raise ourselves into clearer air. The fault of  the atheist is that they knew no better than to borrow the maxims of the  churchmen; and even those who agree with the dogmatic denials of the  atheists--if such there be--ought yet to admit that the mere change from  superstition to reason is a small gain, if the conclusions of reason are  still to be enforced by the instruments of superstition. Our opinions  are less important than the spirit and temper with which they possess  us, and even good opinions are worth very little unless we hold them in  a broad, intelligent, and spacious way. Now some of the opinions of  Chaumette were full of enlightenment and hope. He had a generous and  vivid faith in humanity, and he showed the natural effect of abandoning  belief in another life by his energetic interest in arrangements for  improving the lot of man in this life. But it would be far better to  share the superstitious opinions of a virtuous and benignant priest like  the Bishop in Victor Hugo's _Miserables_, than to hold those good  opinions of Chaumette as he held them, with a rancorous intolerance, a  reckless disregard of the rights and feelings of others, and a shallow  forgetfulness of all that great and precious part of our natures that  lies out of the immediate domain of the logical understanding. One can  understand how an honest man would abhor the darkness and tyranny of the  Church. But then to borrow the same absolutism in the interests of new  light, was inevitably to bring the new light into the same abhorrence  as had befallen the old system of darkness. And this is exactly what  happened. In every family where a mother sought to have her child  baptized, or where sons and daughters sought to have the dying spirit of  the old consoled by the last sacrament, there sprang up a bitter enemy  to the government which had closed the churches and proscribed the  priests.    How could a society whose spiritual life had been nourished in the  solemn mysticism of the Middle Ages, suddenly turn to embrace a gaudy  paganism? The common self-respect of humanity was outraged by apostate  priests who, whether under the pressure of fear of Chaumette, or in a  very superfluity of folly and ecstasy of degradation, hastened to  proclaim the charlatanry of their past lives, as they filed before the  Convention, led by the Archbishop of Paris, and accompanied by rude  acolytes bearing piles of the robes and the vessels of silver and gold  with which they had once served their holy offices. 'Our enemies,'  Voltaire had said, 'have always on their side the fat of the land, the  sword, the strong box, and the _canaille_.' For a moment all these  forces were on the other side, and it is deplorable to think that they  were as much abused by their new masters as by the old. The explanation  is that the destructive party had been brought up in the schools of the  ecclesiastical party, and their work was a mere outbreak of mutiny, not  a grave and responsible attempt to lead France to a worthier faith. If,  as Chaumette believed, mankind are the only Providence of men, surely  in that faith more than in any other are we bound to be very solicitous  not to bring the violent hand of power on any of the spiritual  acquisitions of the race, and very patient in dealing with the slowness  of the common people to leave their outworn creeds.    Instead of defying the Church by the theatrical march of the Goddess of  Reason under the great sombre arches of the Cathedral of Our Lady,  Chaumette should have found comfort in a firm calculation of the  conditions. 'You,' he might have said to the priests,--'you have so  debilitated the minds of men and women by your promises and your dreams,  that many a generation must come and go before Europe can throw off the  yoke of your superstition. But we promise you that they shall be  generations of strenuous battle. We give you all the advantages that you  can get from the sincerity and pious worth of the good and simple among  you. We give you all that the bad among you may get by resort to the  poisoned weapons of your profession and its traditions,--its bribes to  mental indolence, its hypocritical affectations in the pulpit, its  tyranny in the closet, its false speciousness in the world, its menace  at the deathbed. With all these you may do your worst, and still  humanity will escape you; still the conscience of the race will rise  away from you; still the growth of brighter ideals and a nobler purpose  will go on, leaving ever further and further behind them your dwarfed  finality and leaden moveless stereotype. We shall pass you by on your  flank; your fieriest darts will only spend themselves on air. We will  not attack you as Voltaire did; we will not exterminate you; we shall  explain you. History will place your dogma in its class, above or below  a hundred competing dogmas, exactly as the naturalist classifies his  species. From being a conviction, it will sink to a curiosity; from  being the guide to millions of human lives, it will dwindle down to a  chapter in a book. As History explains your dogma, so Science will dry  it up; the conception of law will silently make the conception of the  daily miracle of your altars seem impossible; the mental climate will  gradually deprive your symbols of their nourishment, and men will turn  their backs on your system, not because they have confuted it, but  because, like witchcraft or astrology, it has ceased to interest them.  The great ship of your Church, once so stout and fair and well laden  with good destinies, is become a skeleton ship; it is a phantom hulk,  with warped planks and sere canvas, and you who work it are no more than  ghosts of dead men, and at the hour when you seem to have reached the  bay, down your ship will sink like lead or like stone to the deepest  bottom.'    Alas, the speculation of the century had not rightly attuned men's minds  to this firm confidence in the virtue of liberty, sounding like a bell  through all distractions. None of these high things were said. The  temples were closed, the sacred symbols defiled, the priests  maltreated, the worshippers dispersed. The Commune of Paris imitated the  policy of the King of France who revoked the Edict of Nantes, and  democratic atheism parodied the dragonnades of absolutist Catholicism.           *       *       *       *       *    Robespierre"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#13)"],[1,"Jack let  the giant out of the cellar.    The giant thanked Jack very much for saving him, and asked what he  should give him as a reward?    \"Why, good Uncle,\" said Jack, \"I desire nothing but the coat and cap,  with the rusty sword and the slippers which are hanging beside the  bed.\"    \"Take them,\" said the giant, \"and keep them for my sake. They will be  very useful to you. The coat will make you invisible; the cap will give  you knowledge; the sword will cut through anything, no matter what it  may be, and the shoes are of vast swiftness.\"    Jack took the gifts, thanked the giant, and then quickly caught up with  the Prince.    After a few day's further journey they reached the dwelling of the  beautiful lady whom the Prince had come to rescue.    She received the Prince very graciously and made a feast for him. When  it was ended she rose, and, taking her handkerchief, said:    \"My lord; to-morrow morning I command you to tell me on whom I have  bestowed this handkerchief--or else lose your head.\"    [Illustration]    The Prince went to bed very mournfully; but Jack put on the cap of  knowledge, which told him that the lady was forced by the power of  enchantment to meet the wicked magician every night in the forest.    He, therefore, put on his coat of darkness, and his shoes of swiftness,  and was there before her. When the lady came, she gave the handkerchief  to the magician. Jack with his sword of sharpness cut off his head with  one blow; and the enchantment was ended in a minute.    The next day the lady was married to the Prince, and soon after went  with her husband to the Court of King Arthur, where Jack was made one  of the Knights of the Round Table for his heroism.    [Illustration]    Very soon Jack set off in search of new adventures. On the third day of  his travel he came to a wide forest. Hardly had he entered it when he  heard dreadful shrieks and cries, and soon he saw a monstrous giant  dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and a  beautiful lady. Their tears and cries melted Jack's heart. He alighted  from his horse, and put on his invisible coat, and immediately attacked  the giant. He could not reach up to the giant's body; so, taking a  mighty blow, he cut off both the monster's legs just below the garter,  so that he fell full length upon the ground. Then Jack set his foot upon  his neck and plunged his sword into the giant's body.    [Illustration]    The knight and the lady, overjoyed, begged Jack to come to their house  to refresh himself after this fight; but Jack, hearing that the giant  had a brother who was more cruel and wicked even than himself, would  not rest until he had also destroyed him.    Soon he came in sight of the cavern where the giants lived. There was  the other giant sitting on a huge block of timber, with a knotted iron  club lying by his side. Jack, in his coat of darkness, was quite  invisible. He drew close up to the giant and struck a blow at his head  with his sword of sharpness; but he missed his aim and only cut off his  nose. The giant roared with pain, and his roars were like claps of  thunder. He took up his iron club and began to lay about him, but not  being able to see Jack, he could not hit him; for Jack slipped nimbly  behind, and jumping upon the block of wood, stabbed the giant in the  back; and after a few howls, the monster dropped down dead.    Having thus killed the two monsters Jack entered the cave to search for  the treasure. One room contained a great boiling cauldron and a dining  table, where the giants feasted. Another part of the cave was barred  with iron and was full of miserable men and women whom the giants had  imprisoned. Jack set them all free and divided the treasure among them.    Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it with the head of his brother  to the Court of King Arthur; then he returned to the house of the knight  and his lady.    He was received with the greatest joy; and the knight gave a grand feast  in his honor. When all the company was gathered together, the knight  presented Jack with a ring, on which was engraved the picture of the  giant dragging the knight and the lady by the hair, with this motto  round it--        \"Behold, in dire distress were we,         Under a giant's fierce command,       But gained our lives and liberty         From valiant Jack's victorious hand.\"    But while the merriment was at its height, a herald rushed into the room  and told the company that Thundel, a savage giant with two heads, had  heard of the death of his two kinsmen, and was come to take his revenge  on Jack. The guests trembled with terror and fright; but Jack only drew  his sword and said, \"Let him come!\"    [Illustration]    The knight's house was surrounded by a moat over which there was a  drawbridge. Jack set men to work to cut the bridge on both sides, nearly  to the middle, and then, dressed in his magic coat, went out to meet the  giant. As the giant came along, although he could not see Jack, yet he  could tell that someone was near for he cried out:        \"Fa, fe, fi, fo, fum,       I smell the blood of an Englishman       Be he alive, or be he dead,       I'll grind his bones to make my bread.\"    \"Say you so, my friend,\" cried Jack. \"You are indeed a monstrous  miller!\"    \"Ah!\" cried the giant; \"you are the villain that killed my kinsmen! I  will tear you with my teeth, and grind your bones to powder!\"    [Illustration]    \"You must catch me first!\" said Jack. Then he threw off his coat and put  on his shoes of swiftness, and began to run, the giant following him  like a walking castle. Jack led him round and round the house, and then  he ran over the drawbridge, while the giant rushed after him with his  club. But when he came to the middle of the bridge, where it had been  cut on both sides, his great weight broke it, and he tumbled into the  water.    Jack now got a cart rope and flung it over his two heads, and then, by  the help of a team of horses, drew him to the edge of the moat, where  he cut off his heads.    Once again, Jack set out in search of new adventures. He went over  fields and dales without meeting with any, until he came to the foot of  a high mountain. Here was a little, lonely house; and when he knocked at  the door it was opened by an old man with a beard as white as snow. This  old man was a good hermit, and when Jack had eaten well, he said:    [Illustration]    \"My son, I know that you are the famous conqueror of giants. I know, at  the top of this mountain there is an enchanted castle, kept by a giant  named Galligantes, who, by the help of a magician, gets many knights  into his power--whom he changes into beasts. Above all, I lament the  hard fate of a duke's daughter, whom they have changed into a deer. Many  knights have tried to destroy the enchantment, yet none have been able  to do so, because of two fiery griffins who guard the gates of the  castle. But as you, my son, have an invisible coat, you may pass them by  without being seen. On the gates of the castle you will find engraved  the means by which the enchantment may be broken.\"    Jack promised that in the morning he would risk his life in an endeavor  to break the enchantment; and, after a sound sleep, he arose early and  set out on his attempt.    He passed by the fiery griffins without the least fear of danger; for  they could not see him, because of his invisible coat.    On the castle gate he found a golden trumpet hanging, under which were  written these words--        \"Whoever can this trumpet blow,       Shall cause the giant's overthrow.\"    Jack seized the golden trumpet and blew a mighty blast, which made the  gates fly open and shook the castle to its foundations. The giant and  the magician, knowing that their end was now near, stood biting their  thumbs and shaking with terror. Jack, with his magic sword, soon killed  the giant, and the magician was carried off by a whirlwind. The castle  vanished away like smoke, and the duke's daughter and all the knights  and lovely ladies who had been turned into birds and beasts returned to  their proper shape.    Jack's fame rang through the whole country, and the King gave him a  large estate to reward him for all his brave and knightly deeds. And  Jack married the duke's daughter, and lived in joy and contentment for  the rest of his days.          JACK AND THE BEANSTALK    [Illustration]      Jack was an idle, lazy boy who would do no work to support his widowed  mother; and at last they both came to such poverty that the poor woman  had to sell her cow to buy food to keep them from starving. She sent  Jack to market with the cow, telling him to be sure and sell it for a  good price.    [Illustration]    As Jack was going along the road to market he met a butcher. The butcher  offered to buy the cow in exchange for a hatful of colored beans. Jack  thought the beans looked very pretty, and he was glad to be saved the  long hot walk to market; so he struck the bargain on the spot and went  back to his mother with the beans, while the butcher went off with the  cow.    But the poor widow was very disappointed. She scolded her son for an  idle, lazy, good-for-nothing boy, and flung the beans out of the window  in a passion.    [Illustration]    Now the beans were magic beans, and the next morning, when Jack awoke,  he found some of them had taken root in the night and had grown so tall,  that they reached right up into the sky.    Jack was full of wonder and curiosity; and, being fond of adventure and  excitement, he set out at once to climb the beanstalk, to see what was  up at the top of it.    And he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he  climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed--until at last he climbed right  up to the very tiptop of the beanstalk.    Then he found himself standing in a strange country. In the distance  he could see a big castle; and, as he was hot and tired with his long"]]]
