For three  months, every day of the week, the School Creek was full of sputtering,  choking youngsters.  Every new boy was hunted down to the river in turn,  and by the end of the year there was hardly a boy at Parkhurst who could  not keep his chin up in deep waters.    But this is a long introduction.    One day, two summers after that in which young Jobson and his friend had  tumbled into the Colven, a large party of us were down at the bathing-  place, indulging in what had now become a favourite summer pastime.  It  so happened that our party was made up entirely of boys in the two  senior classes of the school--the fifth and the sixth.  Most of us were  landed and dressing, and while so occupied had leisure to watch the  performances of those who still remained in the water.    Two of these specially interested us, who were swimming abreast about a  hundred yards from the landing-place, evidently racing home.  One of  these chanced to be a sixth-form boy and the other a fifth, and a sudden  impulse seized us of the latter class to cheer our man vehemently, and  back him to be the first to reach home.  The sixth-form fellows, thus  challenged, became equally excited in backing _their_ man, and so,  without premeditation, a regular match was made.  The two swimmers,  hearing our shouts, entered into the spirit of the thing, and a  desperate race ensued.  They came on, neck and neck, towards us, cheered  like mad by their respective supporters, both sides deeming the honour  of his form at stake in the event.  Within a yard or two of the finish  they were still level, when the sixth-form man put on a terrific spurt,  to our huge disgust, and just landed himself in a nose ahead.    Of course, we were not going to be beaten thus, and there and then  demanded our revenge.  Whereupon the company--half of them in a very  elementary stage of dressing, and the other half in no stage at all--  resolved itself into a meeting on the spot, and fixed that day week for  a formal trial of prowess between the two classes.  Three events were to  be contested--a half-mile race, a hundred yards, and a duck hunt--and,  of course, the winner of two out of the three would carry the day.    Then, in great excitement, we finished our toilets and hurried back to  the school, where, naturally, the news of the coming contest spread like  wildfire and caused a great commotion.  The school divided itself  forthwith into two factions, calling themselves the \"fivers\" and  \"sixers.\"  The selection of representatives to compete in the races was  a matter of almost as much excitement as the races themselves, and I  need hardly say it was a proud day for me when I was informed I was to  act in the capacity of \"hunter\" for the fifth in the duck hunt.  I  accepted the honour with mingled pride and misgivings, and spent a busy  week practising for my arduous duties.    Well, the eventful day came at last, and nearly the whole school  mustered at Cramp Corner to see the sport.  For the half-mile race,  which was to come off first, there were only two fellows competing.  Our  man was Barlow--of paper-chase celebrity--while the sixth were very  confident of winning with Chesney, a hero nearly six feet high.  Certainly, as the two stood on the spring-board waiting the signal to  go, there seemed very little chance for the small Jim against his lanky  antagonist, although some of us comforted ourselves with the  contemplation of our man's long arms and the muscles in his legs.  The  course was to be once up Cramp Reach and back--just half a mile.  The  swimmers were at liberty to swim in any manner they chose, and bound  only to one rule--to keep their right side.    They were not long kept waiting in their scanty attire on the planks.  The doctor himself gave the signal to start, and at the word they darted  with two \"swishes\" into the water.  Jim's head was up first, and off he  started at a steady chest-stroke, meaning business.  Chesney's dive was  a long one, and, considering he had a half-mile race before him, a  foolish one, for he taxed his breath at the outset, which might have  been avoided, had he thought less about elegance and more about the  race.  However, he did not seem at first to be any the worse off for he  took a slight lead of Jim, going through the water swiftly and easily,  with as pretty a side-stroke as any fellow's at the school.  In point of  style there was no comparison between the two.  Jim pounded along  monotonously, but steadily, with a square front, preserving all along  the same regular stroke, the same pace, and the same dogged expression  of countenance with which he had entered the water.  His rival, on the  other hand, delighted the spectators by all kinds of graceful variety.  Now he darted forward on his side, now on his back.  Sometimes he  refreshed himself by a swift dive, and sometimes he swung his arms like  a windmill.  In fact, there was scarcely any accomplishment possible in  rapid swimming which he did not give us the benefit of.    But it was evident some of his friends did not approve of his style.  I  heard one of them, running near me, growl, \"I wish he would give over  his capers and swim like a rational animal.\"    \"Rational or not, he's keeping his lead,\" said another, and so he was.  Plodding Jim, with his everlasting chest-stroke, was half a dozen yards  or so behind, and did not look like picking up either.  Nevertheless, we  cheered him like mad, and kept up our hopes that he would \"stay out\" the  better of the two.    When both turned at the top of the reach, Chesney gave up his fanciful  swimming, and, to our alarm, settled down to a side-stroke, which for a  time looked powerful and effective.  But he had been too confident all  along, and now, when he reckoned on shaking off his opponent and getting  a clear lead, he found out he was destined to do just the reverse.  What  long faces the \"sixers\" pulled as their man began to puff and slacken  pace!  A half-mile race is no joke, believe me; and so Chesney began to  find out.  Before half the distance back was covered he showed  unmistakable signs of going to pieces, and--a very ominous sign--took to  changing from one side to another at very frequent intervals.    Of course we \"fivers\" howled with delight!  Our man had never turned a  hair, and was now pulling up at every stroke.  As he drew level, Chesney  gathered up all his remaining strength for a spurt.  But it came to  nothing.  Jim held on his way almost remorselessly, and headed his man  fifty yards from the winning-post; and the next thing we saw was Chesney  pulling up dead, and making for the bank in a very feeble condition.  Jim quietly swam on amid our frantic plaudits, and landed pretty nearly  as fresh as when he started.    So far so good.  Loud and long were our exultations, for we had hardly  expected to win this race; we had put our chief confidence on the  hundred yards, which was to follow.  In this race three a side were  entered, and of our three we knew no one in the school who could beat  Halley at a hundred yards.  It was rumoured, indeed, that Payne, one of  the three \"sixers,\" had been doing very well in training, but the  reports of him were not sufficiently decided to shake our faith in our  own hero.    It was an anxious moment as they stood there waiting for the doctor's  signal.  If only we could win this race, we should have our two races  out of the three in hand without further combat.    \"Go!\" cried the doctor; and at the word six youthful forms plunge into  the water, and for a second are lost to sight.  But the moral of the  half-mile race has evidently been taken to heart by these six boys.  They waste neither time nor wind under the surface, but rising quickly,  dash to their work.  After the first few strokes Payne showed in front,  greatly to the delight of the \"sixers,\" who felt that everything  depended on their man.  We, however, were glad to see our man sticking  close up, and keeping stroke for stroke after his rival.  Of the others,  one only--little Watson--of the sixth seemed to hold his own, and that  was a good three yards in the rear of Halley: while the three others  fell off hopelessly from the very beginning.    The race was short, but eventful.  To our delight, Halley overhauled  Payne before half-way was reached, and we felt now absolutely sure of  the race.  It never occurred to us to think of young Watson at all.  But  all of a sudden it became apparent that that young man meant business.  He changed his front, so to speak, in a very unexpected manner, and just  as we were beginning to exult over our man's certain victory, he lay  over on his side, and, with a peculiar, jerky side-stroke, began to work  his little carcase through the water at a wonderful pace.    Before long he had overtaken his fellow-\"sixer,\" and almost immediately  drew up to our champion.  We were in consternation.  Twenty yards more  would end the race, and if only our man could hold out and keep his  lead, we were all right.  At first it looked as if he would, for,  encouraged by our cheers, and seeing his peril, he spurted, and kept a  good yard ahead of this audacious young \"sixer.\"  But the latter put one  spurt on to another, and drew up inch by inch.  Ten yards from home they  were level; then, for a stroke or two, there was a frantic struggle;  then the \"sixers\" sent forth a shout that must have frightened the very  fishes; and well they might, for their man had won the race, a yard and  a half clear ahead of our champion.    One race each!  And now for the \"duck hunt\" to settle the match.  But  before I go further I ought to explain, for the benefit of those who  have not been initiated into the mysteries of the pastime, how a duck  hunt was managed at Parkhurst.    The part of the river selected was close to the mouth, where the stream "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#13)"],[1,"drops which roll  off into the stream are the only evidence of its recent submersion. It  is, indeed, very interesting to observe _this pretty bird walk down a  stone, quietly descend into the water_, rise again perhaps at a  distance of several yards down the stream, and 'fly'[21] back to the  place it had just left, to perform the same maneuver the next minute,  the silence of the interval broken by its cheerful warbling song.\"          [21] \"Wing its way\" in the ornithological language. I shall take        leave usually to substitute the vulgar word 'fly,' for this        poetical phrase.    92. In which, you see, we have the reason for its being called  'water-blackbird,' being, I think, the only one of the dabchicks that  really sings. Some of the others, (sand-pipers) pipe; and others, the  stints, say 'stint' in a charming manner; but none of them _sing_  except the oiselle. Very singularly, the black-bodiced one seems to  like living near manufactories. \"The specimen in the Norwich Museum,\"  says Mr. Gould, \"is the one mentioned by Mr. Lubbock, in 1845, as  'lately' shot at Hellesdon Mills; and two others are stated by the same  author to have been seen at different times by trustworthy observers at  Marlingford and Saxthorpe. Of more recent occurrence I may mention a  male in my own collection, which was brought to me in the flesh, having  been shot in November, 1855, whilst hovering over the river between the  foundry bridge and the ferry. It is not a little singular that a bird  so accustomed to the clear running streams of the north, and the quiet  haunts of the 'silent angler,' should be found, as in this case, almost  within the walls of the city, sporting over a river turbid and  discolored from the neighboring factories, and with the busy noise of  traffic on every side. About the same time that this bird appeared near  the city, three others were observed on more than one occasion on the  Earlham river, by Mr. Fountaine, of Easton, who is well acquainted with  our British birds; but these suddenly disappeared, and were not seen  again.\"    And all will disappear, and never be seen again, but in skeleton,  ill-covered with camphorated rags of skin, under the present scientific  dispensation; unless some kind-hearted northern squire will let them  have the run and the dip of his brooks; and teach the village children  to let them alone if they like to wade down to the village.    I am sixty-two, and have passed as much time out of those years by  torrent sides as most people. But I have never seen a water-ouzel  alive.      II.    ALLEGRETTA NYMPHAEA.    LILY-OUZEL.    93. We have got so far, by help of our first example, in the etymology  of our entire class, as to rest in the easily memorable root 'dab,'  short for dabble, as the foundation of comprehensive nomenclature. But  the earlier (if not Aryan!) root 'dip,' must be taken good heed to,  also, because, as we further study the customs of aquatic chickens, we  shall find that they really mass themselves under the three great heads  of 'Duckers,' birds that duck their heads only, and stick up their  tails in the air;--'Dippers,' birds that take real dips under, but not  far down, in shallow water mostly, for things at the bottom, or else to  get out of harm's way, staying down about as long as we could  ourselves, if we were used to it;--and 'Divers,' who plunge like stones  when they choose,--can go nobody knows how deep in the deep sea,--and  swim under the water just as comfortably as upon it, and as fast, if  not faster.    But although this is clearly the practical and poetical division, we  can't make it a scientific one; for the dippers and dabblers are so  like each other that we must take them together; and so also the  duckers and divers are inseparable in some of their forms: so that, for  convenience of classing, we must keep to the still more general rank I  have given--dabchick, duck, and gull,--the last being essentially the  aerial sea-bird, which _lives_ on the wing.    94. But there is yet one more 'mode of motion' to be thought of, in the  class we are now examining. Several of them ought really to be  described, not as dipchicks, but as _trip_-chicks; being, as far as I  can make out, little in the habit of going under water; but much in the  habit of walking or tripping daintily over it, on such raft or float as  they may find constructed for them by water-lily or other buoyant  leaves. Of these \"come and trip it as you come\" chicks,--(my emendation  of Milton is surely more reasonable than the emendations of commentators  as a body, for we do not, any of us, like to see our mistresses \"trip  it as they _go_\")--there are, I find, pictured by Mr. Gould, three  'species,' called by him, Porzana Minuta, Olivaceous Crake; Porzana  Pygmaea, Baillon's Crake; and Porzana Maruetta, Spotted Crake.    Now, in the first place, I find 'Porzana' to be indeed Italian for  'water-hen,' but I can't find its derivation; and in the second place,  these little birds are neither water-hens nor moor-hens, nor  water-cocks nor moor-cocks; neither can I find, either in Gould,  Yarrell, or Bewick, the slightest notice of their voices!--though it is  only in implied depreciation of their quality, that we have any  business to call them 'Crakes,' 'Croaks,' or 'Creaks.' In the third  place, 'Olivaceous' is not a translation of 'Minuta,' nor 'Baillon's'  of 'Pygmaea,' nor 'spotted' of 'Maruetta'; which last is another of the  words that mean nothing in any language that I know of, though the  French have adopted it as 'Marouette.' And in the fourth place, I can't  make out any difference, either in text or picture, between Mr.  Baillon's Crake, and the 'minute' one, except that the minute one is  the bigger, and has fewer white marks in the center of the back.    95. For our purposes, therefore, I mean to call all the three  varieties neither Crake nor Porzan, but 'Allegretta,' which will at  once remind us of their motion; the larger one, nine inches long, I  find called always Spotted Crake, so that shall be 'Allegretta  Maculata,' Spotty Allegret; and the two little ones shall be, one, the  Tiny Allegret, and the other the Starry Allegret (Allegretta Minuta,  and Allegretta Stellaris); all the three varieties being generally  thought of by the plain English name I have given at the head of this  section, 'Lily-Ouzel' (see, in Sec. 7, page 5, the explanation of my  system of dual epithet, and its limitations. I note, briefly, what may  be properly considered distinctive in the three kinds.)      II.A.    ALLEGRETTA NYMPHAEA, MACULATA.    SPOTTED ALLEGRET.    96. Water-Crake or 'Skitty' of Bewick,--French, 'Poule d'eau  Marouette,' (we may perhaps take Marouette as euphonious for Maculata,  but I wish I knew what it meant);--though so light of foot, flies  heavily; and, when compelled to take wing, merely passes over the tops  of the reeds to some place of security a short distance off. (Gould.)  The body is \"in all these Rails _compressed_\" (Yarrell,--he means  laterally thin), which enables them to make their way through dense  herbage with facility. I can't find anything clear about its country,  except that it 'occasionally visits' Sweden in summer, and Smyrna in  winter, and that it has been found in Corfu, Sicily, Crete,--Whittlesea  Mere,--and Yarley Fen;--in marshes always, wherever it is; (nothing  said of its behavior on ice,) and not generally found farther north  than Cumberland. Its food is rather nasty--water-slugs and the  like,--but it is itself as fat as an ortolan, \"almost melts in the  _hand_.\" (Gould.) Its own color, brown spotted with white; \"the spots  on the wing coverts surrounded with black, which gives them a studded  or pearly appearance.\" (Bewick,--he means by 'pearly,' rounded or  projecting.) Hence my specific epithet. Its young are of the liveliest  black, \"little balls of black glistening down,\" beautifully put by Mr.  Gould among the white water Crowfoot (Ranunculus Aquatilis), looking  like little ducklings in mourning. \"Its nest is made of rushes and  other buoyant materials matted together, so as to float on, and rise or  fall with, the ebbing or flowing of the water like a boat; and to  prevent its being carried away, it is moored or fastened to a reed.\"  (Bewick.)      II.B.    ALLEGRETTA NYMPHAEA, STELLARIS.    STARRY ALLEGRET.    97. Called 'Stellaris' by Temminck.--I do not find why, but it is by  much the brightest in color of the three, and may be thought of as the  star of them. Gould says it is the least, also, and calls it the  'Pigmy'; but we can't keep that name without confusing it with the  'Minuta.' 'Baillon's Crake' seems the most commonly accepted title,--as  the worst possible. Both this, and the more quietly toned Tiny, in Mr.  Gould's delightful plates of them, have softly brown backs, exquisitely  ermined by black markings at the root of each feather, following into  series of small waves, like little breakers on sand. They have lovely  gray chemisettes, striped gray bodices, and green bills and feet; a  little orange stain at the root of the green bill, and the bright red  iris of the eye have wonderful effect in warming the color of the whole  bird: and with beautiful fancy Mr. Gould has put the Stellaris among  yellow water-lilies to set off its gray; and a yellow butterfly with  blue and red spots, and black-speckled wings (Papilio Machaon), to  harmonize both. It is just as if the flower were gradually turning into  the bird. Examples of the Starry Allegret _have_ been 'obtained'--in  the British Islands. It is said to be numerous, unobtained, in India,  China, Japan, Persia, Greece, North Africa, Italy, and France. I have  never heard of anybody's seeing it, however.      II.C.    ALLEGRETTA NYMPHAEA, MINUTA.    TINY ALLEGRET.    98. 'Tiny Allegret,'--Yarrell's 'Little Crake,' (but see names in  Appendix). It is a little more rosy than 'Stellaris' in the gray of its  neck,"]]]
