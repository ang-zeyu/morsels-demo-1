Reflect on the enormous multiplying power _inherent and  annually in action_ in all animals; reflect on the countless seeds  scattered by a hundred ingenious contrivances, year after year, over the  whole face of the land; and yet we have every reason to suppose that the  average percentage of each of the inhabitants of a country usually  remains constant. Finally, let it be borne in mind that this average  number of individuals (the external conditions remaining the same) in  each country is kept up by recurrent struggles against other species or  against external nature (as on the borders of the Arctic regions, where  the cold checks life), and that ordinarily each individual of every  species holds its place, either by its own struggle and capacity of  acquiring nourishment in some period of its life, from the egg upwards;  or by the struggle of its parents (in short-lived organisms, when the  main check occurs at longer intervals) with other individuals of the  _same_ or _different_ species.    But let the external conditions of a country alter. If in a small  degree, the relative proportions of the inhabitants will in most cases  simply be slightly changed; but let the number of inhabitants be small,  as on an island, and free access to it from other countries be  circumscribed, and let the change of conditions continue progressing  (forming new stations), in such a case the original inhabitants must  cease to be as perfectly adapted to the changed conditions as they were  originally. It has been shown in a former part of this work, that such  changes of external conditions would, from their acting on the  reproductive system, probably cause the organization of those beings  which were most affected to become, as under domestication, plastic.  Now, can it be doubted, from the struggle each individual has to obtain  subsistence, that any minute variation in structure, habits, or  instincts, adapting that individual better to the new conditions, would  tell upon its vigour and health? In the struggle it would have a better  _chance_ of surviving; and those of its offspring which inherited the  variation, be it ever so slight, would also have a better _chance_.  Yearly more are bred than can survive; the smallest grain in the  balance, in the long run, must tell on which death shall fall, and which  shall survive. Let this work of selection on the one hand, and death on  the other, go on for a thousand generations, who will pretend to affirm  that it would produce no effect, when we remember what, in a few years,  Bakewell effected in cattle, and Western in sheep, by this identical  principle of selection?    To give an imaginary example from changes in progress on an island:--let  the organization of a canine animal which preyed chiefly on rabbits, but  sometimes on hares, become slightly plastic; let these same changes  cause the number of rabbits very slowly to decrease, and the number of  hares to increase; the effect of this would be that the fox or dog would  be driven to try to catch more hares: his organization, however, being  slightly plastic, those individuals with the lightest forms, longest  limbs, and best eyesight, let the difference be ever so small, would be  slightly favoured, and would tend to live longer, and to survive during  that time of the year when food was scarcest; they would also rear more  young, which would tend to inherit these slight peculiarities. The less  fleet ones would be rigidly destroyed. I can see no more reason to doubt  that these causes in a thousand generations would produce a marked  effect, and adapt the form of the fox or dog to the catching of hares  instead of rabbits, than that greyhounds can be improved by selection  and careful breeding. So would it be with plants under similar  circumstances. If the number of individuals of a species with plumed  seeds could be increased by greater powers of dissemination within its  own area (that is, if the check to increase fell chiefly on the seeds),  those seeds which were provided with ever so little more down, would in  the long run be most disseminated; hence a greater number of seeds thus  formed would germinate, and would tend to produce plants inheriting the  slightly better-adapted down[B].    Besides this natural means of selection, by which those individuals are  preserved, whether in their egg, or larval, or mature state, which are  best adapted to the place they fill in nature, there is a second agency  at work in most unisexual animals, tending to produce the same effect,  namely, the struggle of the males for the females. These struggles are  generally decided by the law of battle, but in the case of birds,  apparently, by the charms of their song, by their beauty or their power  of courtship, as in the dancing rock-thrush of Guiana. The most vigorous  and healthy males, implying perfect adaptation, must generally gain the  victory in their contests. This kind of selection, however, is less  rigorous than the other; it does not require the death of the less  successful, but gives to them fewer descendants. The struggle falls,  moreover, at a time of year when food is generally abundant, and perhaps  the effect chiefly produced would be the modification of the secondary  sexual characters, which are not related to the power of obtaining food,  or to defence from enemies, but to fighting with or rivalling other  males. The result of this struggle amongst the males may be compared in  some respects to that produced by those agriculturists who pay less  attention to the careful selection of all their young animals, and more  to the occasional use of a choice mate.      II. _Abstract of a Letter from_ C. DARWIN, Esq., _to_ Prof. ASA GRAY,  _Boston, U.S., dated Down, September 5th, 1857._    1. It is wonderful what the principle of selection by man, that is the  picking out of individuals with any desired quality, and breeding from  them, and again picking out, can do. Even breeders have been astounded  at their own results. They can act on differences inappreciable to an  uneducated eye. Selection has been _methodically_ followed in _Europe_  for only the last half century; but it was occasionally, and even in  some degree methodically, followed in the most ancient times. There must  have been also a kind of unconscious selection from a remote period,  namely in the preservation of the individual animals (without any  thought of their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his  particular circumstances. The \"roguing,\" as nurserymen call the  destroying of varieties which depart from their type, is a kind of  selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional selection has  been the main agent in the production of our domestic races; but however  this may be, its great power of modification has been indisputably shown  in later times. Selection acts only by the accumulation of slight or  greater variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere fact  that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to its parent.  Man, by this power of accumulating variations, adapts living beings to  his wants--may be said to make the wool of one sheep good for carpets,  of another for cloth, &c.    2. Now suppose there were a being who did not judge by mere external  appearances, but who could study the whole internal organization, who  was never capricious, and should go on selecting for one object during  millions of generations; who will say what he might not effect? In  nature we have some _slight_ variation occasionally in all parts; and I  think it can be shown that changed conditions of existence is the main  cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents; and in nature  geology shows us what changes have taken place, and are taking place. We  have almost unlimited time; no one but a practical geologist can fully  appreciate this. Think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which  the same species at least of shells have existed; there must have been  during this period millions on millions of generations.    3. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring power at work  in _Natural Selection_ (the title of my book), which selects exclusively  for the good of each organic being. The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert,  and Lyell have written excellently on the struggle for life; but even  they have not written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even  the elephant) breeds at such a rate, that in a few years, or at most a  few centuries, the surface of the earth would not hold the progeny of  one pair. I have found it hard constantly to bear in mind that the  increase of every single species is checked during some part of its  life, or during some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those  annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a trifling  difference must often determine which shall survive, and which perish!    4. Now take the case of a country undergoing some change. This will tend  to cause some of its inhabitants to vary slightly--not but that I  believe most beings vary at all times enough for selection to act on  them. Some of its inhabitants will be exterminated; and the remainder  will be exposed to the mutual action of a different set of inhabitants,  which I believe to be far more important to the life of each being than  mere climate. Considering the infinitely various methods which living  beings follow to obtain food by struggling with other organisms, to  escape danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds  disseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of  generations individuals of a species will be occasionally born with some  slight variation, profitable to some part of their economy. Such  individuals will have a better chance of surviving, and of propagating  their new and slightly different structure; and the modification may be  slowly increased by the accumulative action of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20757"],[0,"Darwinismus und Sozialismus: Der Kampf um das Dasein und die Moderne (#13)"],[1,"nicht mit dem  weit grösseren und =alle= Gesellschaftsglieder ohne Ausnahme umfassenden  Begriff der »Arbeit« als solcher.    Dagegen ist =mein= Programm der Sozialreform klar, durchsichtig und ohne  Anwendung von Gewalt leicht durchführbar, sobald es gelungen sein wird,  die Mehrzahl der Menschen auf friedlichem Wege von der darin liegenden  Gerechtigkeit, sowie von seiner Nützlichkeit und Notwendigkeit zu  überzeugen. Die Wahl zwischen beiden Wege gesellschaftlicher Befreiung  könnte daher, wie mir scheint, nicht schwer sein.    Übrigens will Verfasser von der Sozialdemokratie nicht Abschied nehmen,  ohne, ihr das Verdienst zuzugestehen, dass sie einerseits durch ihre  Agitation eine grosse und wichtige Menschenklasse auf das Missliche und  Unbefriedigende ihrer Lebenslage aufmerksam gemacht, und dass sie  andrerseits vielfache Anregung zur Besprechung und Inangriffnahme der  sozialen Frage überhaupt gegeben hat. Dieses Verdienst wird auch ohne  Lösung der sozialen Frage im sozialdemokratischen Sinne für Herbeiführung  einer besseren gesellschaftlichen Zukunft seine Früchte tragen.    Sollte sich indessen Verfasser in einer Beurteilung der  sozialdemokratischen Lehren geirrt haben so erklärt er sich gerne bereit,  Belehrung anzunehmen.
