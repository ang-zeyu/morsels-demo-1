Dey had ter grease de shirt ter git it off case de blood whar de  oberseer beat him had stuck de shirt tight ter de skin. De marster wuz  in de room an' he axed de boy how come it, an' de boy tole him.    De marster sorta turns white an' he says ter me, 'Will yo' go an' ast  de oberseer ter stop hyar a minute, please?'    When de oberseer comes up de steps he axes sorta sassy-like, 'What yo'  want?'    De marster says, 'Pack yo' things an' git off'n my place as fast as yo'  can, yo' pesky varmit.'    De oberseer sasses de marster some more, an' den I sees de marster  fairly loose his temper for de first time. He don't say a word but he  walks ober, grabs de oberseer by de shoulder, sets his boot right hard  'ginst de seat of his pants an' sen's him, all drawed up, out in de  yard on his face. He close up lak a umbrella for a minute den he pulls  hisself all tergether an' he limps out'n dat yard an' we ain't neber  seed him no more.    No mam, dar wuzent no marryin' on de plantation dem days, an' as one  ole 'oman raised all of de chilluns me an' my brother Johnnie ain't  neber knowed who our folkses wuz. Johnnie wuz a little feller when de  war ended, but I wuz in most of de things dat happen on de plantation  fer a good while.    One time dar, I done fergit de year, some white mens comes down de  riber on a boat an' dey comes inter de fiel's an' talks ter a gang of us  an' dey says dat our masters ain't treatin' us right. Dey tells us dat  we orter be paid fer our wuck, an' dat we hadn't ort ter hab passes ter  go anywhar. Dey also tells us dat we ort ter be allowed ter tote guns if  we wants 'em. Dey says too dat sometime our marsters was gwine ter kill  us all.    I laughs at 'em, but some of dem fool niggers listens ter 'em; an' it  'pears dat dese men gib de niggers some guns atter I left an' promised  ter bring 'em some more de nex' week.    I fin's out de nex' day 'bout dis an' I goes an' tells de marster. He  sorta laughs an' scratches his head, 'Dem niggers am headed fer trouble,  Dave, 'he says ter me, 'an I wants yo' ter help me.'    I says, 'Yas sar, marster.'    An' he goes on, 'Yo' fin's out when de rest of de guns comes Dave, an'  let me know.'    When de men brings back de guns I tells de marster, an' I also tells  him dat dey wants ter hold er meetin'.    'All right,' he says an' laughs, 'dey can have de meetin'. Yo' tell  'em, Dave, dat I said dat dey can meet on Chuesday night in de pack  house.'    Chuesday ebenin' he sen's dem all off to de low groun's but me, an' he  tells me ter nail up de shutters ter de pack house an' ter nail 'em up  good.    I does lak he tells me ter do an' dat night de niggers marches in an'  sneaks dar guns in too. I is lyin' up in de loft an' I hyars dem say dat  atter de meetin' dey is gwine ter go up ter de big house an' kill de  whole fambly.    I gits out of de winder an' I runs ter de house an tells de marster.  Den me an' him an' de young marster goes out an' quick as lightnin', I  slams de pack house door an' I locks it. Den de marster yells at dem,  'I'se got men an' guns out hyar, he yells, 'an' if yo' doan throw dem  guns out of de hole up dar in de loft, an' throw dem ebery one out I'se  gwine ter stick fire ter dat pack house.'    De niggers 'liberates for a few minutes an' den dey throws de guns out.  I knows how many dey has got so I counts till dey throw dem all out, den  I gathers up dem guns an' I totes 'em off ter de big house.    Well sar, we keeps dem niggers shet up fer about a week on short  rations; an' at de end of dat time dem niggers am kyored for good. When  dey comes out dey had three oberseers 'stid of one, an' de rules am  stricter dan eber before; an' den de marster goes off ter de war.    I reckon I was 'bout fifteen or sixteen den; an' de marster car's me  'long fer his pusonal sarvant an' body guard an' he leabes de rest of  dem niggers in de fiel's ter wuck like de dickens while I laughs at dem  Yankees.    Jim belonged to Mr. Harley who lived in New Hanover County during de  war, in fac' he was young Massa Harley's slave; so when young Massa Tom  went to de war Jim went along too.    Dey wuz at Manassas, dey tells me, when Massa Tom got kilt, and de  orders wuz not to take no bodies off de field right den.    Course ole massa down near Wilmington, doan know 'bout young Massa Tom,  but one night dey hears Jim holler at de gate. Dey goes runnin' out; an'  Jim has brung Massa Tom's body all dat long ways home so dat he can be  buried in de family burian ground.    De massa frees Jim dat night; but he stays on a time atter de war, an'  tell de day he died he hated de Yankees for killing Massa Tom. In fact  we all hated de Yankees, 'specially atter we hear 'bout starve dat first  winter. I tried ter make a libin' fer me an' Johnnie but it was bad  goin'; den I comes ter Raleigh an' I gits 'long better. Atter I gits  settled I brings Johnnie, an' so we done putty good.    Dat's all I can tell yo' now Miss, but if'n yo'll come back sometime  I'll tell yo' de rest of de tales.    Shortly after the above interview Uncle Dave who was failing fast was  taken to the County Home, where he died. He was buried on May 4th, 1937,  the rest of the tale remaining untold.          N. C.

Our Marster wuz named Richard Bobbit, but we all calls him Massa  Dick.    Massa Dick ain't good ter us, an' on my arm hyar, jist above de elbow  am a big scar dis day whar he whupped me wid a cowhide. He ain't whupped  me fer nothin' 'cept dat I is a nigger. I had a whole heap of dem  whuppin's, mostly case I won't obey his orders an' I'se seed slaves beat  'most ter deff.    I wuz married onct 'fore de war by de broom stick ceremony, lak all de  rest of de slaves wuz but shucks dey sold away my wife 'fore we'd been  married a year an' den de war come on.    I had one brother, Henry who am wuckin' fer de city, an' one sister  what wuz named Deliah. She been daid dese many years now.    Massa Dick owned a powerful big plantation an' ober a hundert slaves,  an' we wucked on short rations an' went nigh naked. We ain't gone  swimmin' ner huntin' ner nothin' an' we ain't had no pleasures 'less we  runs away ter habe 'em. Eben when we sings we had ter turn down a pot in  front of de do' ter ketch de noise.    I knowed some pore white trash; our oberseer wuz one, an' de shim  shams[3] wuz also nigh 'bout also. We ain't had no use fer none of 'em  an' we shorely ain't carin' whe'her dey has no use fer us er not.    De Ku Kluxes ain't done nothin' fer us case dar ain't many in our  neighborhood. Yo' see de Yankees ain't come through dar, an' we is  skeerd of dem anyhow. De white folks said dat de Yankees would kill us  if'en dey ketched us.    I ain't knowed nothin' 'bout de Yankees, ner de surrender so I stays on  fer seberal months atter de wahr wuz ober, den I comes ter Raleigh an'  goes ter wuck fer de city. I wucks fer de city fer nigh on fifty years,  I reckon, an' jis' lately I retired.    I'se been sick fer 'bout four months an' on, de second day of May.

C. May 13,  1937 by Mary A. Hicks.      I wuz borned at Warrenton in Warren County in 1850. My father wuz named  Washington, atter General Washington an' my mamma wuz named Diasia atter  a woman in a story. Us an' 'bout forty or fifty other slaves belonged  ter Mr. Richard Bobbitt an' we wucked his four hundred acres o' land fer  him. I jist had one brother named Clay, atter Henry Clay, which shows  how Massa Dick voted, an' Delilah, which shows dat ole missus read de  Bible.    We farmed, makin' tobacco, cotton, co'n, wheat an' taters. Massa Dick  had a whole passel o' fine horses an' our Sunday job wuz ter take care  of 'em, an' clean up round de house. Yes mam, we wucked seben days a  week, from sunup till sundown six days, an' from seben till three or  four on a Sunday.    We didn't have many tear-downs an' prayer meetin's an' sich, case de  fuss sturbed ole missus who wuz kinder sickly. When we did have sompin'  we turned down a big wash-pot in front of de do', an' it took up de fuss,  an' folkses in de yard can't hyar de fuss. De patterollers would git  you iffen you went offen de premises widout a pass, an' dey said dat dey  would beat you scandelous. I seed a feller dat dey beat onct an' he had  scars as big as my fingers all ober his body.    I got one whuppin' dat I 'members, an' dat wuz jist a middlin' one. De  massa told me ter pick de cotton an' I sot down in de middle an' didn't  wuck a speck. De oberseer come an' he frailed me wid a cotton-stalk; he  wuz a heap meaner ter de niggers dan Massa Dick wuz. I saw some niggers  what wuz beat bad, but I ain't neber had no bad beatin'.    We libed in log houses wid sand floors an' stick an' dirt chimneys an'  we warn't 'lowed ter have no gyarden, ner chickens, ner pigs."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22994"],[0,"The Frontier in American History (#13)"],[1,"to _Perish for Lack of Vision_? They that have done so,       heretofore, have to their Cost found, that they were got unto       the _Wrong side of the Hedge_, in their doing so. Think, here       _Should this be done any more?_ We read of Balaam, in Num. 22,       23. He was to his Damage, _driven to the_ Wall, when he would       needs make an unlawful Salley forth after the _Gain_ of this       World. . . . Why, when men, for the Sake of Earthly Gain,       would be _going out_ into the _Warm_ Sun, they drive _Through       the Wall_, and the _Angel of the Lord_ becomes their Enemy.    In his essay on \"Frontiers Well-Defended\" (1707) Mather assures the  pioneers that they \"dwell in a Hatsarmaneth,\" a place of \"tawney  serpents,\" are \"inhabitants of the Valley of Achor,\" and are \"the Poor  of this World.\" There may be significance in his assertion: \"It is  remarkable to see that when the Unchurched Villages, have been so many  of them, _utterly broken up_, in the _War_, that has been upon us, those  that have had _Churches_ regularly formed in them, have generally been  under a more _sensible Protection_ of Heaven.\" \"Sirs,\" he says, \"a  _Church-State_ well form'd may fortify you wonderfully!\" He recommends  abstention from profane swearing, furious cursing, Sabbath breaking,  unchastity, dishonesty, robbing of God by defrauding the ministers of  their dues, drunkenness, and revels and he reminds them that even the  Indians have family prayers! Like his successors who solicited  missionary contributions for the salvation of the frontier in the  Mississippi Valley during the forties of the nineteenth century, this  early spokesman for New England laid stress upon teaching anti-popery,  particularly in view of the captivity that might await them.    In summing up, we find many of the traits of later frontiers in this  early prototype, the Massachusetts frontier. It lies at the edge of the  Indian country and tends to advance. It calls out militant qualities and  reveals the imprint of wilderness conditions upon the psychology and  morals as well as upon the institutions of the people. It demands common  defense and thus becomes a factor for consolidation. It is built on the  basis of a preliminary fur trade, and is settled by the combined and  sometimes antagonistic forces of eastern men of property (the absentee  proprietors) and the democratic pioneers. The East attempted to regulate  and control it. Individualistic and democratic tendencies were  emphasized both by the wilderness conditions and, probably, by the prior  contentions between the proprietors and non-proprietors of the towns  from which settlers moved to the frontier. Removal away from the control  of the customary usages of the older communities and from the  conservative influence of the body of the clergy, increased the  innovating tendency. Finally the towns were regarded by at least one  prominent representative of the established order in the East, as an  undesirable place for the re-location of the pillars of society. The  temptation to look upon the frontier as a field for investment was  viewed by the clergy as a danger to the \"institutions of God.\" The  frontier was \"the Wrong side of the Hedge.\"    But to this \"wrong side of the hedge\" New England men continued to  migrate. The frontier towns of 1695 were hardly more than suburbs of  Boston. The frontier of a century later included New England's colonies  in Vermont, Western New York, the Wyoming Valley, the Connecticut  Reserve, and the Ohio Company's settlement in the Old Northwest  Territory. By the time of the Civil War the frontier towns of New  England had occupied the great prairie zone of the Middle West and were  even planted in Mormon Utah and in parts of the Pacific Coast. New  England's sons had become the organizers of a Greater New England in the  West, captains of industry, political leaders, founders of educational  systems, and prophets of religion, in a section that was to influence  the ideals and shape the destiny of the nation in ways to which the eyes  of men like Cotton Mather were sealed.[66:1]      FOOTNOTES:    [39:1] Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, April,  1914, xvii, 250-271.
