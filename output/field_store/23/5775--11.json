Now, you say you would like to make  five hundred pounds and buy a farm?\"    \"Rather!\"    \"And that you would let me go and live on the farm with you and end my  days in peace?\"    \"I would, gladly.\"    \"Well then, if I take you to where Umhlonhlo is, and you will kill him  and get the money, will you give me twenty-five pounds, and let me keep  a few goats, and grow a few mealies on your land?\"    \"I should think I would. But how could one man take or kill Umhlonhlo?  They say he is well armed and that he has a lot of followers with him.\"    \"Umhlonhlo,\" said Ghamba, glancing anxiously round as if he feared the  very ant-heaps were listening, \"is hiding in a cave in the mountain,  not three days' walk from here. He has not got a single man with him,  because he fears being given up. He is really in hiding from his own  followers now. My sister is one of his wives, and that is how I know all  about it. I passed the cave where he lives four nights ago, and saw him  sitting by the fire. He has only a few women with him.\"    \"And how do you think I should take him?\"    \"Take him? you should kill him. I will guide you to the cave by night,  and then you can shoot him as he sits by the fire.\"    Langley, although no coward, was not particularly brave. He did not much  relish the idea of alone tackling the redoubtable Umhlonhlo, a savage of  muscle, who was reported to be always armed to the teeth. Moreover,  he had no gun, and was but an indifferent shot with a revolver. So he  thought over the matter for a few moments and then said:    \"Look here, Ghamba; I do not care to tackle this job alone, but if I can  take another man with me, I am on.\"    \"Then you will only get half of the five hundred pounds, and will not be  able to buy the farm. You need not be afraid; you can shoot him without  his seeing you.\"    \"No,\" said Langley, after a pause; \"I will not go alone, but if you  will let me take another man with me it can be managed. It will make no  difference to you; you will get your twenty-five pounds.\"    \"And how about my going to live on the farm with you?\"    \"Well, I could not buy the farm for two hundred and fifty pounds. Come,  we will give you fifty pounds instead of twenty-five.\"    Ghamba thought for a while and then said:    \"Very well, I consent. But there need be only one other man, and you  will write down on a piece of paper that you will give me fifty pounds.  When can we start?\"    \"I must speak to the other man, and then we will apply for leave. We had  better start soon, or else Umhlonhlo may have gone to some other place  of hiding.\"    \"Yes, we must lose no time.\"    \"All right! Meet me here to-morrow and I will bring my friend. We will  then settle all about it.\"    \"You must not mention this matter to any one else, and you must make  your friend promise to keep the secret.\"    \"Oh, that's all right!\" said Langley. \"Meet me here to-morrow, just  after dinner.\"    Langley went back to camp, Ghamba looking after his retreating figure  with a smile that revealed his teeth in a very striking manner. Langley  was intensely excited, and exacted (quite unnecessarily) the most solemn  promises from Whitson not to divulge the great secret which he confided  to him. Whitson agreed at once to join in the enterprise, which was one  after his own heart.    Next day the three met at the big ant-heap, and Whitson was very  much impressed by Ghamba's teeth. He told Langley afterward that they  reminded him of a picture of the devil which he had seen in a copy of  \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" The old man's story appeared, however, consistent  enough, in spite of his peculiar dentition.    So, after a short conversation, Langley and Whitson returned to camp,  having made an appointment to meet Ghamba again on the following morning  at sunrise, so as to finally arrange as to time of starting, etc. They  went at once to the officer in charge of the detachment and applied  for ten days' leave of absence for the purpose of proceeding to  Pietermaritzburg, which was at once granted.    Next morning they met Ghamba again, and agreed to start on their  expedition that evening. He explained that they must do all their  traveling by night, and lie by during the day; because it would never  do for him, Ghamba, to run the risk of being recognised by persons whom  they might meet. For the sake of his Hlubi relations who were living  among the Pondomise at Qumbu, it was absolutely necessary that he should  not appear in the transaction at all. Were it ever to be even suspected  that he had betrayed the chief, not alone would he be certainly killed,  but all his relations would be shunned by the other natives. He was an  old man, so for him, personally, nothing mattered very much, but a man  is bound to consider the interests of his family. Travelling only  by night, and lying still and hidden during the day, were therefore  absolutely necessary stipulations, and Langley and Whitson agreed to  them as intelligible and reasonable. All being settled, the latter  started for the camp, Ghamba baring his teeth excessively as they walked  away.      At dusk on the evening of the same day, Langley and Whitson met Ghamba  once more at the large ant-heap, and the three at once proceeded on  their course. The only arms taken were revolvers of the government  regulation pattern (breech-loading central fire). They carried  provisions calculated to last eight days, but took no blankets on  account of having to travel at night. When Ghamba volunteered to relieve  them of a considerable share of their respective loads, Langley and  Whitson were filled with grateful surprise.    The plan was as follows: Whitson was to shoot Umhlonhlo, and then remain  in the cave while Langley returned to the camp to report what had been  done, and cause persons who could identify the body to be sent for. They  seem to have had no scruples as to the deed they meant to do; certainly  Umhlonhlo deserved no more mercy than a beast of prey. Nor does it seem  to have struck them that possibly they might shoot the wrong man. But  there was an air of conviction about the manner in which Ghamba showed  his teeth when asked whether he was positive as to the identity of the  man in the cave, that would have dissipated the doubts of most men.  Besides this, he drew out the written undertaking which they had  delivered to him, and said, with a profoundly businesslike look:    \"Do I not want the money? Should I take all this trouble if I did not  know what I were doing?\"    They walked all night, only resting once or twice for a few minutes.  It was found that Ghamba, in spite of his age, was an extremely good  walker; and when they halted at daylight, Langley was so done up that  he could not have held out for another half-hour. Whitson, the wiry, had  not yet felt the least fatigue.    This march had taken them to the very foot of the Drakensberg range,  and they rested in a valley between two of its main spurs. Here they  remained all day, comfortably located in a sheltered nook where there  was plenty of dry grass. Their resting-place was encircled by immense  rocks. Although the surrounding country was desolate to a degree, and  neither a human being nor an animal was to be seen, Ghamba would not  hear of their lighting a fire nor leaving the spot where they rested.  The weather was clear, and neither too warm nor too cold. They slept at  intervals during the day, and at evening felt quite recovered from their  fatigue.    At nightfall they again started, their course leading steeply up the  gorge in which they had rested. Although the pathway became more and  more indistinct, Ghamba appeared never to be at a loss. Langley several  times shuddered, when they passed by the very edge of some immense  precipice, or clambered along some steep mountain-side, where a false  step would have meant destruction. He began to show signs of fatigue  soon after midnight, so at Ghamba's suggestion a considerable portion of  his load was transferred to the shoulders of Whitson, who seemed to be  as tireless as Ghamba himself.    At daybreak they halted in the depths of another tremendous gorge  with precipitous sides. The scenery in this particular area of the  Drakensberg range, the neighbourhood of the Mont aux Sources, is  indescribably grand and impressive, and is quite unlike anything else  in South Africa. Enormous and fantastically shaped mountains are here  huddled together indiscriminately, and between them wind and double deep  gloomy gorges, along the bottoms of which mighty boulders are thickly  strewn. On dizzy ledge and steep slope dense thickets of wild bamboo  grow, and a few stunted trees fill some of the less deep clefts,  wherever the sunshine can penetrate. Splendid as is the scenery, its  gloom, its stillness, its naked crags and peaks, its dark depths that  seem to cleave to the very vitals of the earth, become so oppressive  that, after a few days spent among them, the traveller is filled with  repulsion and almost horror. Few living things have their home there.  You might meet an occasional \"klipspringer\" (an antelope, in habits and  appearance somewhat like the chamois), a wandering troop of baboons, and  now and then a herd of eland in the more grassy areas. There are said to  be a few Bushmen still haunting the caves, but they are seldom or never  seen.    In the afternoon the sun shone into the gorge in which the travellers  were resting, and for a few hours the heat was very oppressive. Whitson  examined his revolver, removing the cartridges and replacing them by  others. He then lay down to sleep, asking Langley to remain awake and  keep a lookout. He had a vague feeling of uneasiness which he could not  overcome. Langley promised to keep awake, but he was too tired to do so.  He sat with his back against a rock, and, after some futile efforts to  keep his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"ebbs.(185)    In later years, however, upon an enquiry being held by the Justiciars of  the Iter (a deg. 14 Edward II, A.D. 1321), the claimant was obliged to  acknowledge that he had disposed of Baynard's Castle in the time of Edward  I, but had especially reserved to himself all rights attaching to the  castle and barony, although he very considerately declared his willingness  to forego the right and title enjoyed by his ancestor of drowning traitors  at Wood Wharf.(186)    (M123)    But it was in time of war that Fitz-Walter achieved for himself the  greatest power and dignity. It then became the duty of the castellain to  proceed to the great gate of St. Paul's attended by nineteen other  knights, mounted and caparisoned, and having his banner, emblazoned with  his arms, displayed before him. Immediately upon his arrival, the mayor,  aldermen, and sheriffs, who awaited him, issued solemnly forth from the  church, all arrayed in arms, the mayor bearing in his hand the city  banner, the ground of which was bright vermilion or gules, with a figure  of St. Paul, in gold, thereon, the head, feet, and hands of the saint  being silver or argent, and in his right hand a sword.(187) The  castellain, advancing to meet the mayor, informed him that he had come to  do the service which the city had a right to demand at his hands, and  thereupon the mayor placed the city's banner in his hands, and then,  attending him back to the gate, presented him with a charger of the value  of L20, its saddle emblazoned with the arms of Fitz-Walter, and its  housing of cendal or silk, similarly enriched.    A sum of L20 was at the same time handed to Fitz-Walter's chamberlain to  defray the day's expenses. Having mounted his charger, he bids the Mayor  to choose a Marshal of the host of the City of London; and this being  done, the communal or \"mote-bell\" is set ringing, and the whole party  proceed to the Priory of Holy Trinity at Aldgate. There they dismount, and  entering the Priory, concert measures together for the defence of the  city. There is one other point worthy of remark, touching the office of  chief banneret, and that is that on the occasion of any siege undertaken  by the London forces, the castellain was to receive as his fee the  niggardly sum of one hundred shillings for his trouble, and no more.    (M124)    It is not improbable that Fitz-Walter's election as leader of the  remonstrant barons was in some measure due to his official position in the  city. It is also probable, as Mr. Riley has pointed out, that the  unopposed admission of the barons into the city, on the 24th May, 1215,  may have been facilitated by Fitz-Walter's connexion, as castellain, with  the Priory of Holy Trinity, situate in the vicinity.    But there were other reasons for selecting Fitz-Walter as their leader at  this juncture. If the story be true, Fitz-Walter had good reason to be  bitterly hostile to King John, for having caused his fair daughter Maude  or Matilda to be poisoned, after having unsuccessfully made an attempt  upon her chastity.(188) This is not the only crime of the kind laid to the  charge of this monarch,(189) and there appears to be too much reason for  believing most of the charges against him to be true. It is certain that  Fitz-Walter was one of the first to entertain designs against John, and  that he and Eustace de Vesci, on whose family the king is said to have put  a similar affront, were forced to escape to France. The story how  Fitz-Walter attracted John's notice by his prowess at a tournament in  which he was engaged on the side of the French, and was restored to the  King's favour and his own estates, is familiar to all.    (M125)    After a feeble attempt to capture Northampton, the barons, with  Fitz-Walter at their head, accepted an invitation from the citizens of  London to enter the city. They made their entry through Aldgate.(190)    The concession which John had recently made to the citizens, viz.:--the  right of annually electing their own mayor(191)--had failed to secure their  allegiance. The city became thenceforth the headquarters of the  barons,(192) and the adhesion of the Londoners was followed by so great a  defection from the King's party (including among others that of Henry de  Cornhill), that he was left without any power of resistance.(193)    (M126)    The citizens met their reward for fidelity to the barons when John was  brought to bay at Runnymede. In drafting the articles of the Great Charter  the barons, mindful of their trusty allies, made provision for the  preservation of the city's liberties, and the names of Fitz-Walter and of  the mayor of the city appear among those who were specially appointed to  see that the terms of the charter were strictly carried out.(194)    By way of further security for the fulfilment of the articles of the  charter the barons demanded and obtained the custody of the City of  London, including the Tower, and they reserved to themselves the right of  making war upon the king if he failed to keep his word. For a year or more  the barons remained in the city, having entered into a mutual compact with  the inhabitants to make no terms with the king without the consent of both  parties.(195)    (M127)    The right of resistance thus established was soon to be carried into  execution. Before the year was out, John had broken faith, and was  besieging Rochester with the aid of mercenaries. An attempt to raise the  siege failed, owing to the timidity (not to say cowardice) of Fitz-Walter,  who, like the rest of the barons, was inclined to be indolent so soon as  the struggle with the king was thought to have ended.(196)    (M128)    The Pope supported his vassal king. For a second time during John's reign  London was placed under an interdict. The first occasion was in 1208, when  the whole of England was put under an interdict, and for six years the  nation was deprived of all religious rites saving the sacraments of  baptism and extreme unction.(197) It was then the object of Innocent to  stir up resistance against John by inflicting sufferings on the people,  now his purpose was to punish the people for having risen against John.    (M129) (M130)    The barons saw no other course open to them but to invite Louis the  Dauphin to come and undertake the government of the kingdom in the place  of John. On the 21st May, 1216, Louis landed at Sandwich and came to  London, where he was welcomed by the barons. Both barons and citizens paid  him homage, whilst he, on his part, swore to restore to them their rights,  to maintain such laws of the realm as were good, and to abolish those (if  any) that were bad.(198) Suspicion, however, had been aroused against  Louis by the confession of a French nobleman who had come over in his  train, and who had solemnly declared on his deathbed that his master had  sworn when once on the throne of England to banish all John's  enemies.(199) Just when matters seemed to be approaching a crisis and the  barons were wavering in their allegiance, John died (19th October, 1216).            CHAPTER IV.          (M131)    Although London remained faithful to Louis after John's death, the barons  began to desert him, one by one (_quasi stillatim_),(200) and to transfer  their allegiance to John's eldest son, a boy of nine years of age, who had  been crowned at Gloucester soon after his father's death, the disturbed  state of the country not allowing of his coming to London for the  ceremony.(201)    (M132)    After his defeat at Lincoln (20th May, 1217), by William the Marshal, Earl  of Pembroke, one of Henry's guardians, Louis beat a hasty retreat to  London and wrote to his father, the French king, to send him military  assistance, for without it he could neither fight nor get out of the  country.    (M133)    Among the prisoners taken at Lincoln were Robert Fitz-Walter, and a  neighbour of his in the ward of Castle Baynard, Richard de Muntfichet,  who, like Fitz-Walter, had also suffered banishment in 1213. The tower or  castle of Muntfichet lay a little to the west of Baynard's Castle, and was  made over in 1276 by Gregory de Rokesle, the mayor, and citizens of London  to the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the purpose of erecting a new house  for the Dominican or Black Friars, in place of their old house in  Holborn.(202) We hear little of Fitz-Walter after this, beyond the facts  that he soon afterwards obtained his freedom, that he went on a crusade,  and continued a loyal subject to Henry until his death in 1235. He is said  to have been in the habit of wearing a precious stone suspended from his  neck by way of a charm, which at his last moments he asked his wife to  remove in order that he might die the easier.(203)    (M134)    A French fleet which had been despatched in answer to Louis was defeated  off Dover by Hubert de Burgh, who had gallantly held that town for John,  and continued to hold it now for Henry. London itself was invested by the  Marshal, and threatened with starvation; but before matters came to  extremes, Louis intimated his willingness to come to terms.(204)    (M135)    A meeting was held on the 11th of September (some say at Kingston,(205)  others at Staines(206)), and a peace concluded.(207) Louis swore fealty to  the Pope and the Roman Church, for which he was absolved from the ban of  excommunication that had been passed on him, and surrendered all the  castles and towns he had taken during the war. He, further, promised to  use his influence to obtain the restoration to England of the possessions  that had been lost beyond the sea.    (M136)    Henry, on his part, swore to preserve to the barons and the rest of the  kingdom, all those liberties which they had succeeded in obtaining from  John. Everything being thus amicably settled, Louis went to London, and,  after borrowing a large sum of money from his former trusty supporters,  betook himself back to his native country.(208) The general"]]]
