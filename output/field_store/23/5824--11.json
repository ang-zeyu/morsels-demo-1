Vol. 1 (of 2) (#13)"],[1,"the requirements of the naval dockyards had become almost  exhausted. From a tonnage of 17,110 tons in 1603, our fleet had risen to  57,463 tons in 1660, and during the 25 years of Charles II's reign it  increased to 103,556 tons. To supply these rapidly expanding  requirements the stock of timber in the country was feared to be  inadequate. From 197,405, loads of timber fit for the Navy in the New  Forest in 1608, the stock sank later to 19,873 in 1707; and in the royal  forests in Gloucestershire a similar state of affairs obtained. At a  meeting of the Council of the Royal Society in November 1662, Evelyn  followed up his recent _Sylva_ by suggesting a discourse 'concerning  planting his Majesty's Forest of Deane with oake, now so much exhausted,  of ye choicest ship-timber in the world.' This was before the days of  steam or even of macadamized roads, when we had to grow our own supplies  of food and Navy timber. True, oak for wainscoting and the like had long  been imported from the Continent; but if we had been anything like  dependent on foreign oak, the Dutch War which shortly afterwards broke  out would probably have cut off the same entirely from reaching our  ports.    It is unnecessary to say much about this charming classic of Forestry,  of whose various excellences the reader can herein judge for himself.  Gracefully written in nervous English and in a cultured style, ornately  embellished according to the then prevailing custom by apt quotations  from the Latin poets, it contains an enormous amount of information in  the shape of legends and of facts ascertained by travel, of observation,  and of experience. No man of his time could possibly have been better  qualified than Evelyn for undertaking the special duty laid upon him;  and he carried out his task in a brilliant manner. _Sylva_ soon ran into  several editions. The fourth edition appeared in the year of his death  (1706) and a fifth in 1729. From 1776 to 1812 other four editions were  published, with notes by Dr. A. Hunter of York, the last of which served  as the text for the celebrated forestry article in the _Quarterly  Review_ for March, 1813. A later issue of Hunter's editions appeared in  1825; but in 1827 ignorant and wanton hands were with much bombastic  language and buffoonry laid on this great classic, when James Mitchell,  an agriculturist, published _Dendrologia; or a Treatise of Forest Trees,  with Evelyn's Silva, revised, corrected, and abridged by a Professional  Planter and Collector of practical Notes forty years_. Since then no  other edition of _Sylva_ has appeared until the present reprint of the  4th edition, making the 12th edition of this classic work.    The publication of _Sylva_ gave an enormous stimulus to planting in  Britain, the benefits from which were subsequently reaped at the end of  the XVIII and the beginning of the XIX century, when during our war with  France the supply of oak timber for shipbuilding almost entirely ran  out. Dr. Hunter's editions did much to revive the ardour for planting,  which was further stimulated by the _Quarterly Review_ article and by  the advice which Sir Walter Scott put into the mouth of the Laird o'  Dumbiedykes to his son: 'Jock, when ye hae naething else to do, ye may  be aye sticking in a tree; it will be growing, Jock, when ye're  sleeping.' To the impetus then given to planting, many of the woods now  growing in different parts of Britain, and especially in Scotland, owe  their origin.    As Evelyn had given the copyright to Allestry, the Royal Society's  printer, _Sylva_ brought no pecuniary profit to its author; and  indirectly it was the cause of disappointment to him. How this came  about may be seen from the following extract from a letter, dated 4th  August 1690, to his friend the Countess of Sunderland, which is further  of interest as giving Evelyn's own account of the origin of  _Sylva_--'when many yeares ago I came from rambling abroad, observ'd a  little time there, and a greate deale more since I came home than gave  me much satisfaction, and (as events have prov'd) scarce worth one's  pursuite, I cast about how I should employ the time which hangs on most  young men's hands, to the best advantage; and when books and severer  studies grew tedious, and other impertinence would be pressing, by which  innocent diversions I might sometime relieve my selfe without complyance  to recreations I took no felicity in, because they did not contribute to  any improvement of the mind. This set me upon planting of trees, and  brought forth my \"Sylva,\" which booke, infinitely beyond my expectation,  is now also calling for a fourth impression, and has been the occasion  of propagating many millions of usefull timber trees thro'out this  nation, as I may justifie (without im'odesty) from ye many letters of  acknowledgement receiv'd from gentlemen of the first quality, and others  altogether strangers to me. His late Majesty Charles the 2nd. was  sometimes graciously pleas'd to take notice of it to me, and that I had  by that booke alone incited a world of planters to repaire their broken  estates and woodes, which the greedy rebells had wasted and made much  havock of. Upon this encouragement I was once speaking to a mighty man,  then in despotic power, to mention the greate inclination I had to serve  his Majesty in a little office then newly vacant (the salary I think  hardly L300) whose province was to inspect the timber trees in his  Majesties Forests, etc., and take care of their culture and improvement;  but this was conferr'd upon another who, I believe, had seldom been out  of the smoake of London, where though there was a greate deale of  timber, there were not many trees. I confesse I had an inclination to  the imployment upon a publique account as well as its being suitable to  my rural genius, borne as I was at Wotton, among the woods.'    A still greater success was achieved by the _Kalendarium Hortense_,  which reached its tenth edition (1706) during Evelyn's lifetime, and of  which two reprints have subsequently been made. This small work was the  forerunner of the more modern books on English gardening, the names of  which are now almost legion.    Previous to this, _Sculptura: or the History and Art of Chalcography and  Engraving in Copper and Mezzo-tinto_, had been published in 1662, being  the first work on this subject that had appeared in England. But it was  a poor production, and ran into no second edition while the author  lived. His chief subsequent literary successes were _Terra: a  Philosophical Discourse of Earth relating to the Culture and Improvement  of it for Vegetation, and for the Propagation of Plants_, (1676), which  was first read before the Royal Society on 29th April 1675, and of which  the third edition was printed in 1706, and _The Compleat Gardiner, or  Directions for cultivating and right ordering of Fruit Gardens and  Kitchen Gardens; with divers Reflections on several parts of Husbandry_,  (1693), which went into five editions by 1710. His History of the Dutch  War, already referred to (page xliii) would have been by far his most  important work in point of length had its completion been allowed, but  only the introductory portion saw the light as _Navigation and Commerce;  their Original and Progress, Containing a succint account of Traffick  in general; etc. etc...... to the beginning of our late differences with  Holland; in which his Majesties title to the Dominion of the Sea is  asserted against the Novel and later Pretenders_. (1674). His own  account of the stoppage of the work is given in the diary for 19th  August 1674,--'His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were  displeas'd at my treatise of the \"Historie of Commerce;\" that the  Holland Ambassador had complain'd to him of what I had touch'd of the  Flags and Fishery, etc., and desired the booke might be call'd in;  whilst on the other side he assur'd me he was exceedingly pleas'd with  what I had done, and gave me many thanks. However, it being just upon  conclusion of the treaty of Breda (indeed it was design'd to have been  publish'd some moneths before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty  told me he must recall it formally, but gave order that what copies  should be publiqly seiz'd to pacifie the Ambassador, should immediately  be restor'd to the printer, and that neither he nor the vendor should be  molested. The truth is, that which touch'd the Hollander was much lesse  than what the King himself furnish'd me with, and oblig'd me to publish,  having caus'd it to be read to him before it went to the presse; but the  error was, it should have been publish'd before the peace was  proclaim'd. The noise of this book's suppression made it presently be  bought up, and turn'd much to the stationer's advantage. It was no other  than the Preface prepar'd to be prefix'd to my History of the whole  Warr; which I now pursued no further.' Years afterwards, however, he  wrote somewhat bitterly on this subject to his intimate friend Pepys, in  a letter dated 28th April 1682, in which he says, 'In sum, I had no  thanks for what I had done, and have been accounted since, I suppose, an  useless fop, and fit only to plant coleworts, and I cannot bend to mean  submissions; and this, Sir, is the history of the Historian. I confess  to you, I had once the vanity to hope, had my patron continued in his  station, for some, at least, honorary title that might have animated my  progress, as seeing then some amongst them whose talents I did not envy:  but it was not my fortune to succeed.' This certainly seems as if Evelyn  had been hoping for knighthood from King Charles. If his desire lay this  way, it is difficult to reconcile such private admission with the  definite statement made in the diary of 19th April, 1661, that 'he might  have receiv'd this honour,' of Knighthood of the Bath 'but declined it.'
