Regarding the geographical positions of these  tribes the reader is referred to the most valuable map of Arabia in Sir  W. Muir's Annals of Early Caliphate, London 1882.]    [Footnote 66: The Life of Mahomet by Sir W. Muir, Vol. IV, pp. 181 and  226.]    [Footnote 67: A branch of Hawazin and sister tribe of the Sakeef  inhabited the province of Najd and were of the Moaddite stock. The tribe  had taken little share with the rest of the Bani Hawazin at the battle  of Honain against the Moslems A.H. 8. The famous poet Lebid, author of  one of the Moallakas, belonged to that tribe. [See the Life of Lebid  from Ketab-ul-Aghani, in an article on the Moallaqah by Lebid, by C.J.  Lyall, C.S., in the Journals of the Asiatic Society, Bengal, No. 1,  1877, pp. 62-76: Calcutta.]]    [Footnote 68: Bani Abd-ul-Kays from Bahrein. The tribe has been  described at page 47. There were many persons in the embassy. They were  Christians before they embraced Islam.]    [Footnote 69: Descended from Anmar of the Kahtanite stock of Yemen.]    [Footnote 70: A sub-tribe of Asad, descendants of Rabia of the Moaddite  stock. These are the Aneze of Burkhardt.]    [Footnote 71: Already described at p. 47. The rest of them now embraced  Islam. It is said that Sura xlix, 17, refers to them.]    [Footnote 72: Bani Azd (Shanovah) from Yemen. This tribe was a portion  of the Azdite tribe left at Yemen at the time of the northern emigration  of Azd. They were a branch of Kahtan of the Kahtanite stock. In their  emigration northward from Yemen they resided a long time in Hijaz at  Batn Murr near Mecca. In their journey further on to the north of Syria,  leaving Kozaa, they changed their name to Ghassan from their long  residence, by the way, near a fountain of that name. The tribes Aus and  Khazraj had separated afterwards from these Ghassanides, and settled at  Yathrib, afterwards known as Medina. One Surad was the chief of the  embassy of Azd from Yemen to Mohammad at Medina. Sir W. Muir says: \"This  person was recognized by Mahomet as the ruler of his clan, and  commission was given to him to war against the heathen tribes in his  neighbourhood.\" (The Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, page 219.) The Arabic  word \"_yojahid_,\" in the original biographies, only means \"to strive,\"  and does not mean \"to make war,\" as understood by Sir W. Muir. He has  himself translated the same word as \"striving\" in Vol. III, page 32. At  page 265 of the same volume he translates it by \"to do utmost.\" I have  discussed the subject in full in Appendix A. of this work.]    [Footnote 73: Another branch of the Azd described above.]    [Footnote 74: Bani Bahila, otherwise called Saad Manat, descendants of  Ghatafan of the Moaddite stock.]    [Footnote 75: Bani Bahra (bin Amr bin Al-Haf bin Kozaa), who were a  branch of the Kozaa of the Himyarite stock, had emigrated to the north,  and settled in the Ghassanide territory.]    [Footnote 76: Bani Bajila, a sister of Khas-am and descendants of Anmar  bin Nizar of the Kahtanite stock. They inhabited Yemen. The Bajila after  professing Islam had destroyed the famous image of Kholasa.]    [Footnote 77: A branch of Bani Aamir bin Saasaa in the centre of  Arabia.]    [Footnote 78: They lived about Yemama and the shores of the Persian  Gulf. They were one of the Moaddite tribes. The war of Basus between  Bani Bakr and their sister tribe Bani Taghlib had lasted for forty  years. There have been famous poets in the Bani Bakr tribe, among whom  are Tarafa, Haris bin Hiliza, and Maimun Al-Asha. The Bani Bakr and Bani  Tamim were constantly at war, which was abandoned under the influence of  Islam, when both the parties were converted to it during the lifetime of  Mohammad.]    [Footnote 79: They were a branch of the Kozaa from the Himyarite stock,  the descendants of Kahtan, and had settled in the north of Arabia in the  Ghassanide territory on the borders of Syria.]    [Footnote 80: A sub-tribe of Kozaa.]    [Footnote 81: A clan of the tribe of Lakhm.]    [Footnote 82: An Arab of the Bani Juzam in the north of Arabia and  Governor of Amman in the Ghassanide territory announced his conversion  to Mohammad by a despatch in A.H. 8.]    [Footnote 83: They have already been described at page 46. Their  deputation waited upon Mohammad on his return from Tabuk.]    [Footnote 84: Descendants of Anmar of the Kahtanite stock.]    [Footnote 85: A sub-tribe of Azd at Yemen.]    [Footnote 86: Already described under Bani Azd.]    [Footnote 87: Bani Hamadan of the Kahtanite descent. An important tribe  in the east of Yemen.]    [Footnote 88: A Christian branch of the Bani Bakr who inhabited Yemama.    \"The account of the embassy of the Bani Hanifa is more decidedly  unfavourable to Christianity, but its details appear of doubtful  authority. Moseilama, the false Prophet, was among the number, and there  are some unlikely anticipations of his sacrilegious claims.    \"As the embassy were departing, Mahomet gave them a vessel in which were  the leavings of the water with which he had performed his lustration;  and he said,--'_When you reach your country, break down your church, and  sprinkle its sight with this water, and make in its place a mosque_'....    \"The story appears to me improbable, because nowhere else is Mahomet  represented as exhibiting such antagonism to Christians and their  churches when they submitted themselves to him.\"--Muir's Life of  Mahomet, Vol. II, pp. 303-4, _footnote_. The author changes his opinion  in the fourth volume of his work and says: \"I have there stated (in Vol.  II) the story to be improbable. But I am now inclined to think that  during the last year or two of Mahomet's life, there was quite enough of  antagonistic feeling against Christianity as it presented itself in the  profession of the Arab and Syrian tribes to support the  narrative.\"--Life of Mahomet by Sir W. Muir, Vol. IV, page 218,  _footnote_.    This is a mere presumption on the part of the writer, and there is no  proof of Mohammad's antagonism towards Christianity at any period of his  life except against those who waged war with him. The following verse of  the Koran will show how far I am true:--    \"Verily they who believe (Moslems), and they who follow the Jewish  religion, and the Christians and Sabeites, whoever of those believeth in  God and the Last Day, and doth that which is right shall have their  reward with their Lord: Fear shall not come upon them, neither shall  they be grieved.\"]    [Footnote 89: Also a Christian tribe in Yemen descended from the  Kahtanite stock of the Bani Madhij, and collateral therefore with Bani  Kinda. Two of the embassy, one of them being Akil or Abd-ul-Masih, the  chief of the deputation, adopted Islam. The rest returned with a full  guarantee from Mohammad for the preservation of their social and  religious liberty. Further information regarding the Bani Haris of  Najran will be found at pp. 48 and 106 of this book.    \"_Katib al Wackidi_, p. 69. The subsequent history of the Najran  Christians is there traced. They continued in possession of their lands  and rights under the treaty during the rest of Mohammad's life and the  whole of Abu Bakr's Caliphate. Then they were accused of taking usury,  and Omar expelled them from the land, and wrote as follows:--    \"The despatch of Omar, the Commander of the Faithful, to the people of  Najran. Whoever of them emigrates is under the guarantee of God. No  Moslem shall injure them;--to fulfil that which Mahomet and Abu Bakr  wrote unto them.    \"Now to whomsoever of the chiefs of Syria and Irac they may repair, let  such chiefs allot them lands, and whatever they cultivate therefrom  shall be theirs; it is an exchange for their own lands. None shall  injure or maltreat them; Moslems shall assist them against oppressors.  Their tribute is remitted for two years. They will not be troubled  except for evil deeds.    \"Some of them alighted in Irac, and settled in Najrania near to Cufa.    \"That the offence of usury is alleged in justification of this measure  appears to me to disprove the common tradition that a command was said  to have been given by Mahomet on his deathbed for the Peninsula to be  swept clear of all other religions but Islam.\"--Muir's Life of Mahomet,  Vol. II, pp. 301-2.]    [Footnote 90: Descendants of the great Ghatafan tribe already  described.]    [Footnote 91: Bani Himyar from Yemen. The Himyarites are too well-known  to be described. The Himyarite princes of Ro-en, Mu-afir, Hamadan and  Bazan, all of the Christian faith in Yemen, embraced Islam and announced  their conversion by letter sent to Mohammad through their emissaries  which reached him after his return from Tabuk.]    [Footnote 92: Either a clan of Lakhm, or a branch of Bani Aamir.]    [Footnote 93: A sub-tribe of the Bani Aamir bin Saasaa already  described.]    [Footnote 94: The King of Oman, together with the people of Oman,  embraced Islam during A.H. 8 and 9. The people of Oman were of the  Azdite stock.]    [Footnote 95: Already described at page 43.]    [Footnote 96: A branch of Saad-al-Ashira from the Kahtanite stock. This  tribe inhabited Yemen. They had some peculiar prejudice against eating  the heart of an animal. Mohammad had caused their chief to break his  superstition, which he did by making him eat the roasted heart of an  animal.    But they returned disgusted when told that his (the chief's) mother who  had committed infanticide was in hell. However they sent another  deputation a second time and finally embraced Islam.]    [Footnote 97: They settled in Dumat-ul-Jundal, now Jal-al-Jowf, north of  Arabia. They were a tribe of the Bani Kozaa descended from Himyar.]    [Footnote 98: A tribe of the Kahtanite stock at Yemen. They lived in a  hilly country of that name in Yemen.]    [Footnote 99: They were a tribe of the Kahtanite stock on the coast of  Yemen.]    [Footnote 100: A clan of the Bani Aamir bin Saasaa of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20930"],[0,"Cosmografía (#13)"],[1,"opuesta en la  órbita, y por consiguiente nuestro planeta se acerca ó se aleja de las  estrellas tan enorme cantidad. Por un efecto de perspectiva fácil de  comprender, las estrellas á que se acerca de esta manera, deberían  parecer separarse unas de otras, acercándose por el contrario entre sí  las estrellas de que se aleja. Pues bien, este efecto es nulo para la  gran mayoría de las estrellas, y sólo se le ha podido medir tratándose  de algunas, respecto de las cuales es, sin embargo, sumamente pequeño.    De ahí se ha deducido que las estrellas en general están tan distantes  de la Tierra, que una longitud de 300 millones de leguas próximamente es  como nula en comparación de sus distancias.    La más cercana á nosotros es, entre las conocidas, la estrella más  brillante de la constelación del Centauro, designada por la letra griega  [Greek: a]--alfa--en los catálogos de estrellas ó en los mapas celestes.  Su distancia á la Tierra ó al Sol es 220 mil veces tan grande como el  radio de la órbita de la Tierra. En números redondos, se eleva á 8,350  mil millones de leguas de 4 kilómetros. Sirio está seis veces más lejos,  y se encuentra á 50,500 mil millones de leguas de nuestro mundo solar.  Para formarse idea de tan prodigiosas distancias, se calcula el tiempo  que tarda en atravesarlas la luz. Sábese que en el corto intervalo de un  segundo, la luz recorre una distancia de 75,000 leguas próximamente:  este es el más rápido de todos los movimientos conocidos. Ahora bien,  para llegarnos, desde la estrella más cercana, tarda la luz algo más de  tres años y medio; de Sirio más de 21 y medio; de la Cabra, ¡72 años por  lo menos!    La inmensa mayoría de las estrellas se encuentran mucho más distantes  aún. Herschel, gran astrónomo inglés, veía en su telescopio estrellas á  que atribuyó distancia 2,300 veces mayor que la de las de primera  magnitud. Por ahí se puede juzgar de la extensión del universo, aun  cuando sólo se considere la parte de él accesible á la visión  telescópica.    =97. Las estrellas son soles.=--Las estrellas brillan con luz propia y no  por efecto de la luz refleja del Sol, según lo efectúan los planetas y  sus satélites. Esta verdad es consecuencia de su inmenso alejamiento.  Cuando se las mira con el telescopio, las más brillantes de entre ellas,  las que pueden considerarse mayores, sólo aparecen como puntos  luminosos, tan pequeños que no hay posibilidad de medirlos.    La consecuencia de todo cuanto antecede es que las estrellas son  verdaderos soles, y probablemente muchas de ellas se encuentran  acompañadas como nuestro astro central, de planetas, satélites y  cometas, formando sistemas análogos á nuestro sistema solar.    =98. Estrellas dobles.=--También existen sistemas de soles. En efecto, se  conocen miles de estrellas que, sencillas al parecer á simple vista, se  descomponen cuando se las examina con el telescopio. Las estrellas que  componen estos pares, giran una alrededor de otra, haciendo la mayor de  ellas respecto de la menor, el mismo papel que nuestro Sol en lo tocante  á uno de los planetas del sistema.    También hay estrellas triples y cuádruples.    =99. Nebulosas, grupos estelares.=--Por último, se conocen multitud de  pequeñas manchas denominadas _nebulosas_, porque á simple vista ó con  anteojos de escaso poder, se parecen á nubes luminosas. Examinadas con  aparatos de gran aumento, muchas de ellas se descomponen en infinidad de  estrellas; son, pues, _grupos estelares_. Pero las hay también que no  han podido ser descompuestas, ya porque se hallen demasiado lejos ó  porque sus estrellas sean muy pequeñas, ya porque se hallen constituídas  por una especie de materia gaseosa, luminosa por sí misma, pero no  condensada en estrellas.    La Via Láctea entera aparece como una gran nebulosa, compuesta por  multitud de estrellas, ya aisladas y dispersas en el cielo, ya agrupadas  en núcleos compactos. Las _nubes de Magallanes_, la _Nube mayor_ y la  _Nube menor_, que se ven en el cielo del hemisferio austral, están  compuestas á la vez de estrellas dispersas, de grupos estelares, y de  nebulosas indescomponibles.    Tal es la estructura del universo considerado en conjunto. Nuestro Sol  con todo su cortejo de planetas y de cometas no es más que un punto del  Cosmos, y la Tierra, tan grande para nosotros, representa apenas un  átomo imperceptible en la masa de los mundos.
