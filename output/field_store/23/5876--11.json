(_M._) We have some doubt of the Commentator's meaning: here as the  alternative includes a separate head and description, _viz._ (xii) in  the succeeding sloka.

Yajnavalkya in these two verses promulgates,  according to the Commentator, the following law. A wife or a daughter  or a mother shall not be entitled (under a preceding rule) to take the  heritage, when there has been a reunion, after separation, of male  members of the family; and of course where there has been no division.  In the case of united brothers, where there is a full brother in the  union, he takes the property, in preference to a half-brother; but, if  the half-brother be united and the full brother separate, the two will  divide the property between them. When, of many full brothers, some  live united and others separate, those united will have the  preference. If there be half brothers, as well as full brothers, in  the union, the former take nothing; but all full brothers, living  separate, share with one or more united half-brothers. Where the  brothers all live separate the rule will of course not apply.]    [Footnote 216: _i. e._ according to the Ratnakara, a son born after  his degradation from cast.]    [Footnote 217: _scil._ hermits, devotees, one who is his father's  enemy, one guilty of a crime of minor degree, one deaf or dumb, one  deprived of an organ of sense.

Finally the poor dead thing is in a deep hole; then  Mrs. Burying-beetle lays her eggs on it, and together they cover it up  with earth. When the grubs hatch they find plenty to eat, and are soon  big burying-beetles, like their mothers and fathers.    \"Did you ever wonder how the little fat worms get inside of chestnuts  and acorns? A beetle called a weevil is the creature which puts the fat  worms there. Mrs. Weevil has a long, slender, curved beak. She crawls up  on to the side of a chestnut, bores a hole in the side, then lays an egg  deep down in it. After a while the egg hatches and a tiny grub begins to  feed on the nut. Fatter and fatter it gets; sometimes it lies in the nut  all winter, but more often it crawls out and buries itself in the ground  while it grows into a weevil.    \"Some day, as you are walking along a sunny road in the country, you may  meet a blister-beetle. It is a pretty, bluish-green color, and when you  pick it up you will see drops of oil oozing out of its joints. The dried  bodies will raise a blister on the skin, and that is the reason we call  such beetles blister-beetles. There is a queer blister-beetle who lays  her eggs near bees' nests. The baby beetles then wait for a bee to come  along. They fasten themselves to the hairs on the bee's body. When the  bee goes to its nest to put in the honey the young beetle manages to  get into a honey-cell with the egg. Mrs. Bee does not see that anything  is amiss, seals up the cell, and flies away for another load. The larva  first eats the egg of Mrs. Bee, then it changes into a clumsy kind of a  fellow, floats in the honey, and eats all it can so that it will quickly  become a grown-up.    \"There is one beetle which plants a tiny fungus in its home in the  ground. The babies run along and eat the tips of this delicacy, while  the mothers and fathers take larger bites. These are called  ambrosia-beetles, because of the dainty food they eat. Now that the  storm is over, I mustn't tell you anything more than a few words about  the engraver-beetle, which lives between the bark and the live wood of a  tree. Mr. and Mrs. Engraver-Beetle make a long tunnel under the bark.  Mrs. Engraver makes notches along the sides, and in every notch lays an  egg. When the babies hatch, each one begins a tunnel for itself, running  out straight from the long one. And now that's the end of this story.\"    \"Well, Ben,\" said Tom, respectfully, \"these children don't know the  value of the things they are learning. It's a privilege, sir, to have a  chance to guide with you. I've learned more in these last years about  God's wonders from you than ever I learned in all my long life. I didn't  know there were so many beetles in the world.\"    \"These are only half a dozen of a multitude of beetles which we haven't  the time to name.\"    \"Now, off to bed, children,\" said Mrs. Reece, \"or you'll never be able  to get up early. Good-night to every one!\"          XIV    A DAY'S HUNTING      It was a glorious day after the night's storm. By five o'clock the  children were ready to go hunting with Ben Gile.    Although they were rather sleepy, yet they managed to get an early  breakfast--five o'clock is an early breakfast, isn't it?--and by six  o'clock they were off into the woods. Ben Gile made the children follow  behind him in single file, and so in line, making as little noise as  possible, they went through the woods. The birch-trees and poplars, in  the midst of the darker, heavier foliage, seemed golden with the early  sunlight. Everywhere the bushes sparkled with the rain of the night  before. They took a path that ran almost in a curve around one entire  side of the mountain. Ben Gile kept a sharp lookout, for the partridge,  he knew, would be upon the ground or up in the trees. He pointed to  several places where partridge had been scratching. The woods were full  of them, and every minute he expected to hear the whir of their wings as  they started up. And, sure enough, there was suddenly a loud beating of  wings, and then, crack! crack! crack! from the shot-gun. Down came three  plump partridges. Not more than ten minutes later the old man brought  down three more. Then he let Jack, who was a good shot, take his gun,  and down came two more.    \"Eight partridge,\" he exclaimed, \"and quite enough for us all! We shoot  only what we actually need for food, not a bird more. Oho! somebody else  made a home here. Old Paw Bear has been tearing it out and licking his  chops.\"    The children leaned forward, looking eagerly. \"What was it?\" they asked.    \"Honey,\" said the guide. \"Paw Bear has a sweet tooth for honey and  berries.\"    \"I should think the bees would sting him,\" said Jimmie.    \"They do try to, but little he cares, with his thick coat of hair. Not a  bit. The bees have another enemy, too, which is always hovering about to  find a chance to get into the busy little house; that is the bee-moth.  If she gets the least opportunity Mother Bee-Moth lays her eggs in the  wax of the honeycomb, for the baby moths are very fond of wax. It's not  an easy matter to get in when the bees are not looking, but she manages  it quite often; and when the little larvas hatch out of the eggs, they  eat the wax and the mischief is done. When Mother Bee-Moth is seen the  bees rush upon her and sting her to death. They have good cause to hate  her, for the wax is precious, hard to make and to mould into the little  cells. It is not pleasant to have some miserable worm eat the roof from  your head. Oftentimes the bees are so discouraged that they decide, as  they talk it over in bee language, that it is easier to build a new home  than to repair the old one. They settle upon an hour of departure, and  off they go.\"    \"But I didn't know,\" said Betty, \"that bees live in their hives; I  thought that they just stored their honey there.\"    \"So did I,\" said Jimmie.    It was Jack's time to smile, for, a country boy, he had often watched  the hives. \"Couldn't you tell us something, sir? Here's a bit of the  cone left.\"    \"Do you want to hear?\"    \"Oh, I think bees are so interesting!\" Betty clapped her hands.    [Illustration: LEAF-CUTTER BEE]    \"Did you ever look closely at a bee? Their bodies are covered with  hairs, unlike the hairs found on other insects, for each hair is a tiny  plume. And their mouths, which they have to use for so many different  things, are remarkably made; each part is formed to do a certain kind of  work. First there are the strong biting jaws, then another pair of jaws  joined to the lower lip, which move easily back and forth. This forms a  sucking instrument, which the bees use for drinking nectar.\"    \"My,\" exclaimed Peter, \"it must be convenient to have two pairs of  jaws!\"    \"On the head, too, are antennae, which form little elbows, like those of  the ant. With these the bee smells and feels. Some bees have short  tongues, and usually live alone; others have long tongues, and generally  live in colonies. Perhaps a long tongue makes an insect sociable, and  perhaps sociability makes a tongue grow long.\"    The children were looking at their tongues to see which had the longest.  Peter scanned his anxiously. \"Your tongue is awfully long, Pete,\" said  Jack.    \"I know an interesting short-tongued bee who lives in a house by  herself. Her name is Andrena. She bores a hole in the ground, digging  out a wide hallway. From this she digs side passages, each one ending  in a little closed room. The walls of these rooms are hard and shiny,  like porcelain. When Andrena finishes her house she makes a nourishing  paste of nectar and pollen. Pollen is the yellow powder from flowers.  You know bees, by carrying about the pollen, help in fertilizing the  flowers. But of this we shall learn more some day when we are talking  about the flowers. This powder the bee packs down into the little rooms.  Then she lays an egg on each pile of food and builds a door to shut the  egg away safely.\"    \"Do bees always feed their children on nectar and pollen?\" asked Hope.    \"Always,\" replied the old man. \"They never feed their babies on other  insects, as the ants and wasps do. Then there are the little  short-tongued bees who live in apartments, the apartments all clustered  together, with a common wide passageway into the ground and separate  hallways. Around the main opening is an odd chimney, built on a slant,  which prevents the rain from pouring into the open doorway.\"    The children were wide-eyed with astonishment. That bees should build  chimneys was more than they could believe!    \"Goodness!\" said Jimmie, \"if that is what a short-tongued bee can do,  what can a long-tongued bee do?\"    \"They are very clever. Some are carpenters, some masons, some miners,  some tailors. The leaf-cutter bee makes a neat home, covering the walls  with pretty, green leaves. First she digs a tunnel in a suitable branch  of wood; then she goes to a rosebush, cuts out an oval piece of a rose  leaf, and arranges it smoothly on the walls of the tunnel; cuts other  oval pieces and puts them on, fastening the edges neatly together. In  the bottom of the tunnel she puts some pollen paste, lays an egg on the  paste, cuts some circular pieces of rose leaf, which she presses on the  top of the egg and pollen, forming a green roof for the room and a floor  for the room above. She puts in more food and another egg, until the  tunnel is full of little rooms.\"    \"And what does the carpenter-bee do?\" asked Jack, looking with new  respect at the bit of honeycomb he held in his hand.    \"She makes doors of pith, and, like the tender mother she is, sits on  top of the nest waiting for her babies to grow up. This is a most  unusual thing for a bee mother to do. The egg at the very bottom of the  tube hatches first, but it has to wait until the others hatch.  By-and-by Mrs. Carpenter-Bee takes them all out for a sunny flight in  the"]]]
