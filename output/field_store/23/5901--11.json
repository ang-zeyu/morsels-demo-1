The same thing was again and again repeated, until we rode as close to  the shore as the tug could take us, then the line was cut, a rope was  thrown us from shore, and with a steam windlass or other contrivance, we  were hauled upon the sands.    Then a gangplank was speedily pushed out over the intervening watery  space which the passengers took their turns in crossing until all stood  upon the beach; a few, to be sure, with wet feet, damp clothing and  soggy tempers if some vicious, big breaker in parting had dashed its  white foam-tipped waters over their heads, but all glad and thankful to  arrive in Nome at last.          CHAPTER IX.    NOME.      The man who had predicted that we would find no comforts in Nome proved  himself a true prophet. There were none. Crowded, dirty, disorderly,  full of saloons and gambling houses, with a few fourth-class restaurants  and one or two mediocre hotels, we found the new mining camp a typical  one in every respect. Prices were sky high. One even paid for a drink of  water. Having our newly found Alaska appetites with us, we at once, upon  landing, made our way to an eating house, the best to be found.    Here a cup of poor tea, a plate of thin soup and questionable meat stew  with bread were served us upon nicked china, soiled table linen and with  blackened steel knives and forks, for the enormous sum of one dollar a  head; which so dumbfounded us that we paid it without a murmur, backed  out the door and blankly gazed into each other's faces.    \"Such prices will ruin us!\" gasped the madam.    \"That table linen! Ugh!\" shuddered the young man.    \"Fifteen cents in California for such a meal!\" growled the English girl  in her matter-of-fact way, and with wide distended eyes; while I found  such amusement in watching the three faces before me that I barely  found breath to remind them of the two tons of nice things in their own  packing cases at the landing.    \"If only they are soon landed,\" groaned madam, and we set off at our  best gait to find the cases.    But we did not succeed. The freight was being unloaded from the ship, we  were told, as rapidly as it was possible to handle it, but one lighter  and small tug boat in a very rough sea, unloading a ship two miles off  the beach, must have time; and we waited. Only two or three lighters  were to be had at Nome. Other large steamers were being unloaded, and  hundreds of people were hourly being landed upon the beach. There was no  shelter for them anywhere, every building was full, and confusion was  badly confounded. To make matters worse it began to rain. If we could  only find our freight and get our tents, beds, supplies, etc., we would  be all right, but it would be impossible that day we found, after making  repeated excursions through the freight house and numberless inquiries  at the office.    Something must be done, but what? I now remembered some Dawson  acquaintances in town made the fall before while coming down the Yukon  River with my brother. To one family of these I made my way. They were  in the grocery and bakery business on a prominent corner on First street  and their signboard caught my eye.    Blessings on the heads of kind Mr. and Mrs. M. of Nome City! They were  delighted to see me. They lived back of the store in one room, which  contained their bed, stove, cupboard, baby-organ, table, chairs and  trunks; but they also owned a one-room shack next door, which was vacant  for a few days, being already rented to a dentist who would make some  repairs before taking possession. I could bring my friends and baggage  into this without charge, if I wished, until we secured our freight,  Mrs. M. said kindly, and I pressed her hand in real gratitude with many  thanks.    \"I am almost ashamed to show you the room,\" said the kind little woman,  as she unlocked the door of the shack and stepped inside, \"but it is  better than no shelter in this rain, and you can have a fire in the  stove,\" pointing to a small and rusty coal heater in one corner. \"I wish  I had some blankets or fur robes to lend you, but everything I have is  in use. You are welcome to bring in as many friends as you like if they  will share the poor place with you; and you are quite safe here, too,  for you see the barracks are just opposite,\" pointing across the muddy  little alley down which a few boards had been laid for a sidewalk; \"and  the soldiers are here to keep order, though they do sometimes find it  rather a hard job.\"    Then I thanked the little woman again most heartily, and, as I took from  her hands the door-key and stepped outside into the rain to bring my  waiting friends and baggage from the freight house, I offered a little  prayer of thanks to our good Father, and hurried away.    [Illustration: NOME.]    At the steamer's landing all was hurly-burly and noise. It was now late  in the afternoon, still raining at intervals, and muddy under foot,  though the weather was not cold. Finding my English friends I told them  of Mrs. M.'s kindness and offer of her room, which they were well  pleased to accept with me, and we gathered up our luggage and started  for the place. Passing through the freight house on our way to the  street, madam said, pointing to the figures of two woman huddled in a  corner:    \"See! Judge R. from the St. Paul has not found a room yet, and Mrs. R.  and her friend, the nurse, are sitting there, waiting for the judge to  return! His wife is nearly sick, and they have no idea where they can  get a room. Judge R. has been looking hours for one without success,\"  she said, in a sympathetic tone.    \"Let us speak to them,\" said I, going over to where the ladies sat.    Hearing their story, and seeing for myself that both women were cold,  hungry and disheartened, I decided on the spot to share Mrs. M.'s  hospitality with them; made the proposal, which they very thankfully  accepted, and we trailed off up the street laden with luggage.    Then madam's son was found, informed of the situation, asked to bring  Judge R. and a few loaves of bread from the shop, along with the  remaining luggage, to our new camping place in the little board shack  near the barracks.    Seeing us arrive, and that the three elderly ladies looked worn and  travel-stained, Mrs. M. urged us to come into her room and take tea and  crackers which she had already placed upon the table. This invitation  the older ladies gladly accepted, while the English girl and myself  looked after our new lodgings.    Here now was a state of things indeed! The entire stock of luggage for  seven grown persons was soon deposited in the middle of the floor. The  room of which the shack consisted was about eight by ten feet square,  set directly upon the ground, from which the water oozed at every step  of the foot. Two small windows, a front and back door, with the small  stove--that was all. These were our accommodations for the night, and  perhaps several nights and days.    Then we two set to work with a will. We swept the floor, we gathered  sticks for a fire, we threw boards down outside the door upon which to  walk instead of in the mud, a pail of water was brought from a hydrant  after paying twenty-five cents for it, and a box was converted into a  table. Luggage was sorted, lunch baskets were ransacked, while tin cups,  coffee pot, knives, forks and spoons were found, with a fresh white  cloth upon which to spread the food.    When Judge R. finally appeared, it was supper time. He carried a tin  fry-pan under one arm, a bag containing one dozen eggs, and a few slices  of ham on a paper plate, for which articles he had paid the goodly sum  of one dollar and seventy-five cents.    Waving the fry-pan above his old grey head, the jolly judge shouted:  \"See, the conquering hero comes! Oh, but I'm hungry! Say, how in the  world did you get this place? I hunted four mortal hours and failed to  find a shack, room, or tent for the night. Four thousand people landed  here today, and still they come. Jerusalem crickets! What a crowd!  Everybody is in from Dan to Beersheba! We will have fifteen thousand  people here soon if they don't stop coming, and no shelter for 'em!\"  Then changing his tone and glancing toward his wife:    \"And how is my dear little wifey by this time?\" tenderly patting Mrs.  R.'s white hand, which belonged to a woman tipping the beam at two  hundred.    \"Aren't you glad we came? I am.\" Then rattling on without giving his  wife a chance to speak, for her eyes had filled with tears:    \"I think I've got a 'case' already. Claim number four on D. Creek jumped  last winter while owner was away--jumper won't leave--talked with owner  today--think I'll get the job,\" said the hopeful old judge, sitting on  an empty cracker box and eating bread and cheese from his fingers.    \"Eat your supper, dear,\" to his wife, who was taking nothing, \"and you  shall have a bed tonight--the best in Nome City. See! There it is now,\"  pointing to a big roll of dark brown canvas done up with a few varnished  sticks.    \"A folding cot--new patent--good and strong. (It'll need to be strong to  hold you up, won't it, dearie?) Now, please take your tea like a good  girl, to brace up your courage. Or would you like a drop of sherry?\"    To all this Mrs. R. shook her head, but she did not speak, neither did  she attempt to eat, for there was a big lump in her throat which  prevented.    The rest of our party enjoyed the supper. Some sat on boxes, others  stood up, but we ate ham and eggs, bread, butter and cheese, tea and  crackers, pickles, jellies and jams, as being the greatest \"comforts\" we  could find in the camp, and we made them speedily disappear.    At last the supper things were cleared away, and remaining food repacked  in the baskets. The patent cot was unrolled, set up and made ready for  Mrs. R., who was the only one favored"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#13)"],[1,"to the bottom of the lake.  Will you obey me?\"    \"Yes, indeed, I will,\" said the witch; but she thought, \"He would not be  so timid about letting me touch the back of his head if he were not  afraid of my magic. I will put my hand on his head, and then he will  always be in my power.\" So when they were far out over the lake, she put  her hand on the crane's head, and before she could say \"Oh!\" she was at  the bottom of the lake.    \"You shall never live in the light again,\" said the crane, \"for you have  done no good on earth. You shall be a whitefish, and you shall be food  for the Indians as long as they eat fish.\"          WAS IT THE FIRST TURTLE?      Once upon a time there was a great fight between two tribes of Indians.  It was so fierce that the river ran red with blood, and the war-cries  were so loud and angry that the animals of the forest ran away in  terror. The warriors fought all day long, and when it began to grow  dark, all the men on one side had been killed but two warriors, one of  whom was known as Turtle. In those days there were no such animals as  turtles in the ponds and rivers, and no one knew why he was called by  that name. At last Turtle's friend was struck by an arrow and fell to  the ground.    \"Now yield!\" cried the enemies.    \"Friend,\" said Turtle, \"are you dead?\"    \"No,\" said his friend.    \"Then I will fight on,\" said Turtle, and he called out, \"Give life again  to the warriors whom you have killed with your wicked arrows, and then I  will yield, but never before. Come on, cowards that you are! You are  afraid of me. You do not dare to come!\"    Then his enemies said, \"We will all shoot our arrows at once, and some  one of them will be sure to kill him.\" They made ready to fire, but  Turtle, too, made ready. He had two thick shields, and he put one over  his back and one over his breast. Then he called to his fierce enemies,  \"Are you not ready? Come on, fierce warriors! Shoot your arrows through  my breast if you can.\"    The warriors all shot, but not an arrow struck Turtle, for the two  shields covered his breast and his back, and whenever an arrow buzzed  through the air, he drew in his head and his arms between the shields,  and so he was not harmed. \"Why do you not aim at me?\" he cried. \"Are you  shooting at the mountain, or at the sun and the moon? Good fighters you  are, indeed! Try again.\"    His enemies shot once more, and this time an arrow killed the wounded  friend as he lay on the ground. When Turtle cried, \"Friend, are you  living?\" there was no answer.    \"My friend is dead,\" said Turtle. \"I will fight no more.\"    \"He has yielded,\" cried his enemies.    \"He has not,\" said Turtle, and with one great leap he sprang into the  river. His enemies did not dare to spring after him.    \"Those long arms of his would pull us to the bottom,\" they said; \"but we  will watch till he comes up, and then we shall be sure of him.\"    They were not so sure as they thought, for he did not come up, and all  that they could see in the water was a strange creature unlike anything  that had been there before.    \"It has arms and a head,\" said one.    \"And it pulls them out of sight just as Turtle did,\" said another.    \"It has a shield over its back and one over its breast, as Turtle had,\"  said the first. Then all the warriors were so eager to watch the strange  animal that they no longer remembered the fight. They crowded up to the  shore of the river.    \"It is not Turtle,\" cried one.    \"It _is_ Turtle,\" declared another.    \"It is so like him that I do not care to go into the water as long as it  is in sight,\" said still another.    \"But if this is not Turtle, where is he?\" they all asked, and not one of  the wise men of their tribe could answer.          WHY THE CROCODILE HAS A WIDE MOUTH.      \"Come to my kingdom whenever you will,\" said the goddess of the water to  the king of the land. \"My waves will be calm, and my animals will be  gentle. They will be as good to your children as if they were my own.  Nothing in all my kingdom will do you harm.\"    The goddess went back to her home in the sea, and the king walked to the  shore of the river and stood gazing upon the beautiful water. Beside him  walked his youngest son.    \"Father,\" asked the boy, \"would the goddess be angry if I went into the  water to swim?\"    \"No,\" answered the father. \"She says that nothing in all her wide  kingdom will do us harm. The water-animals will be kind, and the waves  will be calm.\"    The boy went into the water. He could swim as easily as a fish, and he  went from shore to shore, sometimes talking with the fishes, sometimes  getting a bright piece of stone to carry to his father. Suddenly  something caught him by the foot and dragged him down, down, through the  deep, dark water. \"Oh, father!\" he cried, but his father had gone away  from the shore, and the strange creature, whatever it was, dragged the  boy down to the very bottom of the river.    The river was full of sorrow for what the creature had done, and it  lifted the boy gently and bore him to the feet of the goddess. His eyes  were closed and his face was white, for he was dead. Great tears came  from the eyes of the goddess when she looked at him. \"I did not think  any of my animals would do such a cruel thing,\" she said. \"His father  shall never know it, for the boy shall not remember what has happened.\"    Then she laid her warm hand upon his head, and whispered some words of  magic into his ear. \"Open your eyes,\" she called, and soon they were  wide open. \"You went in to swim,\" said the goddess. \"Did the water  please you?\"    \"Yes, surely.\"    \"Were the water-animals kind to you?\"    \"Yes, surely,\" answered the boy, for the magic words had kept him from  remembering anything about the strange creature that had dragged him to  the bottom of the river.    The boy went home to his father, and as soon as he was out of sight, the  goddess called to the water-animals, \"Come one, come all, come little,  come great.\"    \"It is the voice of the goddess,\" said the water-animals, and they all  began to swim toward her as fast as they could.    When they were together before her, she said, \"One of you has been cruel  and wicked. One of you has dragged to the bottom of the river the son of  my friend, the king of the land, but I have carried him safely to shore,  and now he is in his home. When he comes again, will you watch over him  wherever in the wide, wide water he may wish to go?\"    \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" cried the water-animals.    \"Water,\" asked the goddess, \"will you be calm and still when the son of  my friend is my guest?\"    \"Gladly,\" answered the water.    Suddenly the goddess caught sight of the crocodile hiding behind the  other animals. \"Will you be kind to the boy and keep harm away from  him?\" she asked.    [Illustration: \"THE MOUTH THAT WILL NOT OPEN MUST BE MADE TO OPEN\"]    Now it was the crocodile that had dragged the boy to the bottom of the  river. He wished to say, \"Yes,\" but he did not dare to open his mouth  for fear of saying, \"I did it, I did it,\" so he said not a word. The  goddess cried, \"Did you drag the king's son to the bottom of the river?\"  Still the crocodile dared not open his mouth for fear of saying, \"I did  it, I did it.\" Then the goddess was angry. She drew her long sword, and  saying, \"The mouth that will not open when it should must be made to  open,\" she struck the crocodile's mouth with the sword. \"Oh, look!\"  cried the other animals. The crocodile's mouth had opened; there was no  question about _that_, for it had split open so far that he was afraid  he should never be able to keep it closed.          THE STORY OF THE PICTURE ON THE VASE.      On some of the beautiful vases that are made in Japan there is a picture  of a goddess changing a dragon into an island. When the children of  Japan say, \"Mother, tell us a story about the picture,\" this is what the  mother says:--    \"Long, long ago there was a goddess of the sea who loved the people of  Japan. She often came out of the water at sunset, and while all the  bright colors were in the sky, she would sit on a high rock that  overlooked the water and tell stories to the children. Such wonderful  stories as they were! She used to tell them all about the strange fishes  that swim in and out among the rocks and the mosses, and about the fair  maidens that live deep down in the sea far under the waves. The children  would ask, 'Are there no children in the sea? Why do they never come out  to play with us?' The goddess would answer, 'Some time they will come,  if you only keep on wishing for them. What children really wish for they  will surely have some day.'    \"Then the goddess would sing to the children, and her voice was so sweet  that the evening star would stand still in the sky to listen to her  song. 'Please show us how the water rises and falls,' the children would  beg, and she would hold up a magic stone that she had and say, 'Water,  rise!' Then the waves would come in faster and faster all about the  rock. When she laid down the stone and said, 'Water, fall!' the waves  would be still, and the water would roll back quickly to the deep sea.  She was goddess of the storm as well as of the sea, and sometimes the  children would say, 'Dear goddess, please make us a storm.' She never  said no to what they asked, and so the rain would fall, the lightning  flare, and the thunder roll. The rain would fall all about them, but the  goddess did not let it come near them. They were never afraid of the  lightning, for it was far above their heads, and they knew that the  goddess would not let it come down.    \"Those were happy times, but there is something more to tell that is not  pleasant. One of the goddess's sea-animals was a dragon, that often used  to play in the water near the shore. The children never thought of being  afraid of any of the sea-animals, but one day the cruel dragon seized a  little child in his mouth, and in a"]]]
