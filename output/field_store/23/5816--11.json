Of one thing he was sure--that he could not have found his back-trail.  But he divined he was never to retrace his steps on this journey. The  stretch of broken plateau before him grew wilder and bolder of outline,  darker in color, weirder in aspect, and progress across it grew slower,  more dangerous. There were many places Nagger should not have been put  to--where a slip meant a broken leg. But Slone could not turn back. And  something besides an indomitable spirit kept him going. Again the sound  resembling thunder assailed his ears, louder this time. The plateau  appeared to be ending in a series of great capes or promontories. Slone  feared he would soon come out upon a promontory from which he might see  the impossibility of further travel. He felt relieved down in the  gullies, where he could not see far. He climbed out of one, presently,  from which there extended a narrow ledge with a slant too perilous for  any horse. He stepped out upon that with far less confidence than  Nagger. To the right was a bulge of low wall, and a few feet to the  left a dark precipice. The trail here was faintly outlined, and it was  six inches wide and slanting as well. It seemed endless to Slone, that  ledge. He looked only down at his feet and listened to Nagger's steps.  The big horse trod carefully, but naturally, and he did not slip. That  ledge extended in a long curve, turning slowly away from the precipice,  and ascending a little at the further end. Slone, drew a deep breath of  relief when he led Nagger up on level rock.    Suddenly a strange yet familiar sound halted Slone, as if he had been  struck. The wild, shrill, high-pitched, piercing whistle of a stallion!  Nagger neighed a blast in reply and pounded the rock with his iron-shod  hoofs. With a thrill Slone looked ahead.    There, some few hundred yards distant, on a promontory, stood a red  horse.    \"My Lord! ... It's Wildfire!\" breathed Slone, tensely.    He could not believe his sight. He imagined he was dreaming. But as  Nagger stamped and snorted defiance Slone looked with fixed and keen  gaze, and knew that beautiful picture was no lie.    Wildfire was as red as fire. His long mane, wild in the wind, was like  a whipping, black-streaked flame. Silhouetted there against that canyon  background he seemed gigantic, a demon horse, ready to plunge into  fiery depths. He was looking back over his shoulder, his head very  high, and every line of him was instinct with wildness. Again he sent  out that shrill, air-splitting whistle. Slone understood it to be a  clarion call to Nagger. If Nagger had been alone Wildfire would have  killed him. The red stallion was a killer of horses. All over the Utah  ranges he had left the trail of a murderer. Nagger understood this,  too, for he whistled back in rage and terror. It took an iron arm to  hold him. Then Wildfire plunged, apparently down, and vanished from  Slone's sight.    Slone hurried onward, to be blocked by a huge crack in the rocky  plateau. This he had to head. And then another and like obstacle  checked his haste to reach that promontory. He was forced to go more  slowly. Wildfire had been close only as to sight. And this was the  great canyon that dwarfed distance and magnified proximity. Climbing  down and up, toiling on, he at last learned patience. He had seen  Wildfire at close range. That was enough. So he plodded on, once more  returning to careful regard of Nagger. It took an hour of work to reach  the point where Wildfire had disappeared.    A promontory indeed it was, overhanging a valley a thousand feet below.  A white torrent of a stream wound through it. There were lines of green  cottonwoods following the winding course. Then Slone saw Wildfire  slowly crossing the flat toward the stream. He had gone down that  cliff, which to Slone looked perpendicular.    Wildfire appeared to be walking lame. Slone, making sure of this,  suffered a pang. Then, when the significance of such lameness dawned  upon him he whooped his wild joy and waved his hat. The red stallion  must have heard, for he looked up. Then he went on again and waded into  the stream, where he drank long. When he started to cross, the swift  current drove him back in several places. The water wreathed white  around him. But evidently it was not deep, and finally he crossed. From  the other side he looked up again at Nagger and Slone, and, going on,  he soon was out of sight in the cottonwoods.    \"How to get down!\" muttered Slone.    There was a break in the cliff wall, a bare stone slant where horses  had gone down and come up. That was enough for Slone to know. He would  have attempted the descent if he were sure no other horse but Wildfire  had ever gone down there. But Slone's hair began to rise stiff on his  head. A horse like Wildfire, and mountain sheep and Indian ponies, were  all very different from Nagger. The chances were against Nagger.    \"Come on, old boy. If I can do it, you can,\" he said.    Slone had never seen a trail as perilous as this. He was afraid for his  horse. A slip there meant death. The way Nagger trembled in every  muscle showed his feelings. But he never flinched. He would follow  Slone anywhere, providing Slone rode him or led him. And here, as  riding was impossible, Slone went before. If the horse slipped there  would be a double tragedy, for Nagger would knock his master off the  cliff. Slone set his teeth and stepped down. He did not let Nagger see  his fear. He was taking the greatest risk he had ever run.    The break in the wall led to a ledge, and the ledge dropped from step  to step, and these had bare, slippery slants between. Nagger was  splendid on a bad trail. He had methods peculiar to his huge build and  great weight. He crashed down over the stone steps, both front hoofs at  once. The slants he slid down on his haunches with his forelegs stiff  and the iron shoes scraping. He snorted and heaved and grew wet with  sweat. He tossed his head at some of the places. But he never hesitated  and it was impossible for him to go slowly. Whenever Slone came to  corrugated stretches in the trail he felt grateful. But these were few.  The rock was like smooth red iron. Slone had never seen such hard rock.  It took him long to realize that it was marble. His heart seemed a  tense, painful knot in his breast, as if it could not beat, holding  back in the strained suspense. But Nagger never jerked on the bridle.  He never faltered. Many times he slipped, often with both front feet,  but never with all four feet. So he did not fall. And the red wall  began to loom above Slone. Then suddenly he seemed brought to a point  where it was impossible to descend. It was a round bulge, slanting  fearfully, with only a few little rough surfaces to hold a foot.  Wildfire had left a broad, clear-swept mark at that place, and red  hairs on some of the sharp points. He had slid down. Below was an  offset that fortunately prevented further sliding, Slone started to  walk down this place, but when Nagger began to slide Slone had to let  go the bridle and jump. Both he and the horse landed safely. Luck was  with them. And they went on, down and down, to reach the base of the  great wall, scraped and exhausted, wet with sweat, but unhurt. As Slone  gazed upward he felt the impossibility of believing what he knew to be  true. He hugged and petted the horse. Then he led on to the roaring  stream.    It was green water white with foam. Slone waded in and found the water  cool and shallow and very swift. He had to hold to Nagger to keep from  being swept downstream. They crossed in safety. There in the sand  showed Wildfire's tracks. And here were signs of another Indian camp,  half a year old.    The shade of the cottonwoods was pleasant. Slone found this valley  oppressively hot. There was no wind and the sand blistered his feet  through his boots. Wildfire held to the Indian trail that had guided  him down into this wilderness of worn rock. And that trail crossed the  stream at every turn of the twisting, narrow valley. Slone enjoyed  getting into the water. He hung his gun over the pommel and let the  water roll him. A dozen times he and Nagger forded the rushing torrent.  Then they came to a box-like closing of the valley to canyon walls, and  here the trail evidently followed the stream bed. There was no other  way. Slone waded in, and stumbled, rolled, and floated ahead of the  sturdy horse. Nagger was wet to his breast, but he did not fall. This  gulch seemed full of a hollow rushing roar. It opened out into a wide  valley. And Wildfire's tracks took to the left side and began to climb  the slope.    Here the traveling was good, considering what had been passed. Once up  out of the valley floor Slone saw Wildfire far ahead, high on the  slope. He did not appear to be limping, but he was not going fast.  Slone watched as he climbed. What and where would be the end of this  chase?    Sometimes Wildfire was plain in his sight for a moment, but usually he  was hidden by rocks. The slope was one great talus, a jumble of  weathered rock, fallen from what appeared a mountain of red and yellow  wall. Here the heat of the sun fell upon him like fire. The rocks were  so hot Slone could not touch them with bare hand. The close of the  afternoon was approaching, and this slope was interminably long. Still,  it was not steep, and the trail was good.    At last from the height of slope Wildfire appeared, looking back and  down. Then he was gone. Slone plodded upward. Long before he reached  that summit be heard the dull rumble of the river. It grew to be a  roar, yet it seemed distant. Would the great desert river stop Wildfire  in his flight? Slone doubted it. He surmounted the ridge, to find the  canyon opening in a tremendous gap, and to see down, far down, a  glittering, sun-blasted slope"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#13)"],[1,"always concluded the  recital of this Sura with the words: \"God is great.\" The practice thus  became a \"Sunnat\" obligation; that is, it should be done because the  Prophet did it.    The doctrine of abrogation is a very important one in {59} connection with  the study of the Quran. It is referred to in the verses: \"Whatever verses  we cancel or cause thee to forget, we give thee better in their stead, or  the like thereof.\" (Sura ii. 100). This is a Madina Sura. \"What He pleaseth  will God abrogate or confirm; for with Him is the source of revelation.\"  (Sura xiii. 39). Some verses which were cancelled in the Prophet's  life-time are not now extant. Abdullah Ibn Masud states that the Prophet  one day recited a verse, which he immediately wrote down. The next morning  he found it had vanished from the material on which it had been written.  Astonished at this, he acquainted Muhammad with the fact, and was informed  that the verse in question had been revoked. There are, however, many  verses still in the Quran, which have been abrogated. It was an exceedingly  convenient doctrine, and one needed to explain the change of front which  Muhammad made at different periods of his career. Certain rules have been  laid down to regulate the practice. The verse which abrogates is called  _Nusikh_, and the abrogated verse _Mansukh_. _Mansukh_ verses are of three  kinds:--first, where the words and the sense have both been abrogated;  secondly, where the letter only is abrogated and the sense remains;  thirdly, where the sense is abrogated though the letter remains. Imam Malik  gives as an instance of the first kind the verse: \"If a son of Adam had two  rivers of gold, he would covet yet a third; and if he had three he would  covet yet a fourth. Neither shall the belly of a son of Adam be filled, but  with dust. God will turn unto him who shall repent.\" The Imam states that  originally this verse was in the Sura (ix.) called Repentance. The verse,  called the \"verse of stoning\" is an illustration of the second kind. It  reads: \"Abhor not your parents for this would be ingratitude in you. If a  man and woman of reputation commit adultery, ye shall stone them both; it  is a punishment ordained by God; for God is mighty and wise.\" The Khalif  Omar says this verse was extant in Muhammad's life-time but that it {60} is  now lost. But it is the third class which practically comes into  'Ilm-i-usul. Authorities differ as to the number of verses abrogated. Sale  states that they have been estimated at two hundred and twenty-five. The  principal ones are not many in number, and are very generally agreed upon.  I give a few examples. It is a fact worthy of notice that they occur  chiefly, if not almost entirely, in Suras delivered at Madina. There, where  Muhammad had to confront Jews and Christians, he was at first politic in  his aim to win them over to his side, and then, when he found them  obstinate, the doctrine of abrogation came in conveniently. This is seen  plainly in the following case. At Mecca Muhammad and his followers did not  stand facing any particular direction when at prayer, a fact to which the  following passage refers:--\"To God belongeth the east and west; therefore,  whithersoever ye turn yourselves to pray there is the face of God.\" (Sura  ii. 109). When Muhammad arrived at Madina, he entered into friendship with  the Jews and tried to win them to his side. The Qibla (sanctuary) towards  which the worshippers now invariably turned at prayer was Jerusalem. This  went on for a while, but when Muhammad claimed to be not merely a Prophet  for the Arabs, but the last and the greatest of all the Prophets, when he  asserted that Moses had foretold his advent, and that his revelations were  the same as those contained in their own Scriptures, they utterly refused  allegiance to him. In the first half of the second year of the Hijra the  breach between them was complete. It was now time to reconcile the leaders  of the Quraish tribe at Mecca. So the verse quoted above was abrogated by:  \"We have seen thee turning thy face towards heaven, but we will have thee  turn to a Qibla, which shall please thee. Turn then thy face toward the  Holy Temple (of Mecca), and wherever ye be, turn your faces toward that  part.\" (Sura ii. 139.) The Faithful were consoled by the assurance that  though they had not done so hitherto, yet God would not let their {61}  faith be fruitless, \"for unto man is God merciful, gracious.\" (v. 138.) The  doctrine of abrogation is brought in for a more personal matter in the  following case: \"It is not permitted to thee to take other wives hereafter,  nor to change thy present wives for other women, though their beauty charm  thee, except slaves, whom thy right hand shall possess.\" (Sura xxxiii. 52.)  This is said by Beidawi, and other eminent Muslim divines, to have been  abrogated by a verse which though placed before it in the arrangement of  verses, was really delivered after it. The verse is: \"O Prophet, we allow  thee thy wives whom thou hast dowered, and the slaves which thy right hand  possesseth out of the booty which God hath granted thee; and the daughters  of thy uncle, and the daughters of thy aunts, both on thy father's side,  and on thy mother's side, who have fled with thee (to Madina), and any  other believing woman, who hath given herself up to the Prophet; if the  Prophet desireth to wed her, it is a peculiar privilege for thee, above the  rest of the Faithful.\" (Sura xxxiii. 49.)    The Moghul Emperor Akbar, wishing to discredit the 'Ulama, in one of the  meetings so frequently held for discussion during his long reign,  propounded the question as to how many free born women a man might marry.  The lawyers answered that four was the number fixed by the Prophet. \"Of  other women who seem good in your eyes marry two and two, and three and  three, and four and four.\" (Sura iv. 3.) The Emperor said that he had not  restricted himself to that number, and that Shaikh 'Abd-un-Nabi had told  him that a certain Mujtahid had had nine wives. The Mujtahid in question,  Ibn Abi Lailah reckoned the number allowed thus 2+3+4=9. Other learned men  counted in this way 2+2, 3+3, 4+4=18. The Emperor wished the meeting to  decide the point.    Again, the second verse of Sura lxxiii reads: \"Stand up all night, except a  small portion of it, for prayer.\" According to a Tradition handed down by  'Ayesha the last verse {62} of this Sura was revealed a year later. It  makes the matter much easier. \"God measureth the night and the day; he  knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and therefore turneth to you  mercifully. Recite _then so much of the Quran as may be easy to you_.\" (v.  20.)    The following is an illustration of a verse abrogated, though there is no  verse to prove its abrogation. However, according to the Ijma' it has been  abrogated. \"But alms are only to be given to the poor and the needy and to  those who collect them, and to those whose hearts are won to Islam.\" (Sura  ix. 60.) The clause--\"to those whose hearts are won to Islam\"--is now  cancelled.[57] Muhammad, to gain the hearts of those, who lately enemies,  had now become friends, and to confirm them in the faith, gave them large  presents from the spoils he took in war; but when Islam spread and became  strong, the 'Ulama agreed that such a procedure was not required and said  that the order was \"mansukh.\"    The other verses abrogated relate to the Ramazan fast, to Jihad, the law of  retaliation, and other matters of social interest.    The doctrine of abrogation is now almost invariably applied by Musalman  controversialists to the Old and New Testaments, which they say are  abrogated by the Quran. \"His (Muhammad's) law is the abrogator of every  other law.\"[58] This is not, however, a legitimate use of the doctrine.  According to the best and most ancient Muslim divines, abrogation refers  entirely to the Quran and the Traditions, and even then is confined to  commands and prohibitions. \"Those who imagine it to be part of the  Muhammadan creed that one law has totally repealed another, are utterly  mistaken--we hold no such doctrine.\"[59] In the Tafsir-i-Itifaq it is  written: \"Abrogation affects those {63} matters which God has confined to  the followers of Muhammad, and one of the chief advantages of it is that  the way is made easy.\" In the Tafsir-i-Mazhiri we find: \"Abrogation refers  only to commands and prohibitions, not to facts or historical  statements.\"[60] Again, no verse of the Quran, or a Tradition can be  abrogated unless the abrogating verse is distinctly opposed to it in  meaning. If it is a verse of the Quran, we must have the authority of  Muhammad himself for the abrogation; if a Tradition, that of a Companion.  Thus \"the word of a commentator or a Mujtahid is not sufficient unless  there is a 'genuine Tradition' (Hadis-i-Sahih), to show the matter clearly.  The question of the abrogation of any previous command depends on  historical facts with regard to the abrogation, not on the mere opinion of  a commentator.\" It cannot be shown that either Muhammad or a Companion ever  said that the Bible was abrogated. This rule, whilst it shows that the  assertion of modern controversialists on this point is void of foundation,  also illustrates another point to which I have often called attention,  _viz._; that in Islam all interpretation must be regulated by  traditionalism.    Additions were occasionally made. Thus when it was revealed that those who  stay at home were not before God as those who go forth to war, Abdullah and  Ibn Um-Maktum said: 'and what if they were blind.' The Prophet asked for  the shoulder-blade on which the verse was written. He then had a spasmodic  convulsion. After his recovery he made Zeid add the words, \"free from  trouble.\" So now the whole verse reads thus: \"Those believers who sit at  home _free from trouble_ (_i.e._, bodily infirmity), and those who do  valiantly in the"]]]
