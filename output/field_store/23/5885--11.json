The Upper House had no weight with the people; the Lower House had no  weight with the Crown.    One of the greatest drawbacks to the country's prosperity was the method  of granting public lands. It had been the policy of Governor Simcoe to  encourage immigration from the United States, as well as from Great  Britain and continental Europe. He had offered great inducements, in the  shape of free grants of wild lands, to persons settling in Upper Canada,  and his offer had produced the expected results in the shape of a full  tide of immigrants. He had, however, exercised a rigid personal  supervision over these grants, and had done his utmost to prevent the  abuse of his bountiful regulations. His successors were less scrupulous,  and being, as has been seen, under the control of greedy and selfish  persons, they permitted the public lands to be used as means of  enriching and corrupting the favourites of the Administration. The  land-granting department was honeycombed by jobbery and corruption.  Grants of five thousand acres were made to each member of the Executive  Council, and of twelve hundred acres to each of their children. Similar  grants were made to certain favoured members of the Legislative Council  and their children.[35] Numerous other personages who could command  sufficient influence at Court obtained grants of twelve hundred acres  each. The extent of an ordinary grant was two hundred acres. From the  creation of the Province down to 1804 these donations were unattended by  any cost whatever to the grantees beyond trifling fees to the officials  for their trouble in passing the entries through the office books. The  privilege of obtaining landed estates for nothing was abused to such an  extent, however, that the Home Office interfered, and in the year last  named a scale of fees proportionate to the extent of the grant was  introduced; but U. E. Loyalists, officers, soldiers, Executive  Councillors and their children were exempt even from this trifling  burden. In 1818 the performance of certain settlement duties was imposed  upon all persons receiving grants, without any exemptions, and in after  years several other scales of fees were introduced from time to time.  The public lands were committed to the care of an official called the  Surveyor-General, and it was not until 1827 that a Commissioner of Crown  Lands was appointed. During the first thirty-five years of the  Province's history grants of land were entirely subject to the  discretion of the Governor-in-Council, not merely as to the quantity and  situation of the land itself, but also as to whether the applicant  should receive any grant at all.[36] Under such a system it was  inevitable that the grossest partiality should prevail, and it was but  seldom that any one succeeded in obtaining a grant until those in  authority had satisfied themselves that he was to be relied upon to  uphold any policy which they might see fit to dictate. Official  dignitaries granted lands to their servants and other dependants, and,  as soon as certain requisite forms had been complied with, these lands  were transferred to themselves or their children. In other cases persons  were actually hired by the month to draw land and perform the settlement  duties, after which the land was conveyed to their employers. Having the  run of the official books, these cormorants contrived in one way and  another to acquire for themselves and their creatures all the best lands  in the Province, either wholly for nothing or at a price which was  merely nominal. \"The keys of office,\" says a writer already quoted from,  \"were held by themselves or friends, and no admittance to their secrets  was allowed except to the initiated, whose favourable out-of-door  statements could be relied on. Never since the Norman invasion of  England was there such a wholesale partition of plunder.\"[37] Many  persons owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, entire  townships.[38] Others owned thousands of acres which they had never  seen. As the taxes imposed on unsettled lands were trifling, these  immense tracts were no appreciable expense to their owners, who could  hold them from year to year, until the progress of settlement rendered  them of immense value. Such progress was inevitable, for though these  huge reservations tended to keep back the country, settlers obtained  grants of adjoining lands, and their labours could not fail to increase  the value of all contiguous territory. The Home District, including the  most valuable portion of Upper Canada, was especially afflicted by these  wholesale reservations, but every part of the Province was more or leas  crippled by them.    The ruling faction and their favourites, not satisfied with the enormous  direct and indirect grants of lands which they managed in one way and  another to obtain, availed themselves of every opportunity to buy up  land which had been granted to persons who had expended their little all  on their properties, and had thereby become impoverished. Among these  latter were many half-pay officers and others of good birth but limited  means, who had sought homes for themselves in the Canadian wilderness.  Not a few had been compelled to sell their commissions in order to  obtain the wherewithal to settle themselves and their families on the  lands granted to them. Finding themselves cut off from society, and  ill-suited to face the privations of pioneer life, they became  discouraged, and sold their lands for whatever meagre price they could  get. The land-jobbers were ever on the alert to buy up these tracts at a  few shillings an acre, not with any intention of settling upon or  improving them, but solely for the purpose of holding them for an  increased value. The grants to the children of U. E. Loyalists were the  constant subjects of bargain and sale, and wrought great evil to the  Province without producing any corresponding benefit to the recipients.  Very few of the lots so granted were ever occupied by the grantees, most  of whom were young persons of both sexes who resided with their parents,  and had no inclination to set up for themselves in the wilderness. These  grants were frequently sold at ridiculously low prices. From two to five  pounds was an ordinary price for a lot of two hundred acres. Mr. John  Radenhurst, who was Chief Clerk in the office of the Surveyor-General  for many years, is entitled to speak on this subject with authority. In  his evidence taken before Lord Durham's Commissioner, in 1838, he states  that the general price paid by speculators for the two-hundred-acre lots  granted to sons and daughters of U. E. Loyalists was \"from a gallon of  rum up to perhaps six pounds.\" In answer to another question, he states  that while millions of acres were granted in this way, the settlement of  the Province was not advanced, nor the advantage of the grantee secured  in the manner that may be supposed to have been contemplated by  Government. He mentions the Honourable Robert Hamilton, a member of the  Legislative Council, and the two Chief Justices, Elmsley and Powell, as  among the largest purchasers of these lands. Mr. Hamilton's acquisitions  amounted to about a hundred thousand acres.[39] Elmsley and Powell, in  addition to the five thousand acres which each of them had obtained for  nothing as members of the Executive Council, managed to acquire  quantities of land which, had they been brought together in one spot,  would have made a township of average size. Thus was monopoly  perpetuated and increased from year to year, and thus were large tracts  of the Provincial territory maintained in a state of primitive  wilderness.    Intimations of the gigantic abuses existing in the land-granting system  of Upper Canada were more than once sent across the Atlantic to the  Colonial Secretary, who instructed the Lieutenant-Governor to impose  certain regulations with a view to preventing the continuous repetition  of injustice. The Colonial Office, however, was more than three thousand  miles away, and means were easily found for evading any restrictions  imposed at such a distance. Some idea of the extent which the evil had  attained in the year 1818 may be derived from the two passages in that  very petition to the Prince Regent for which Mr. Gourlay was indicted at  Kingston and Brockville, as related in the preceding chapter. \"The lands  of the Crown in Upper Canada,\" proceeds the petition, \"are of immense  extent, not only stretching far and wide into the wilderness, but  scattered over the Province, and intermixed with private property  already cultivated. The disposal of this land is left to ministers at  home, who are palpably ignorant of existing circumstances, and to a  council of men resident in the Province, who, it is believed, have long  converted the trust reposed in them to purposes of selfishness. The  scandalous abuses in this department came some years ago to such a pitch  of monstrous magnitude that the Home ministers wisely imposed  restrictions upon the Land Council of Upper Canada. These, however, have  by no means removed the evil; and a system of patronage and favouritism,  in the disposal of the Crown Lands, still exists; altogether destructive  of moral rectitude and virtuous feeling in the management of public  affairs. Corruption, indeed, has reached such a height in this Province  that it is thought no other part of the British Empire witnesses the  like, and it is vain to look for improvement until a radical change is  effected. It matters not what characters fill situations of public trust  at present--all sink beneath the dignity of men--become vitiated and  weak, as soon as they are placed within the vortex of destruction.  Confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system; and the  very lands of the Crown, the giving away of which has created such  mischief and iniquity, have ultimately come"]]]
