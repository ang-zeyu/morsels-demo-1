Now once again--a little more haughtily.\"    \"Simpson--Simpson--Simpson.\"    Joan regarded her with affectionate approval.    \"It's wonderful!\" she said. \"You might have been doing it all  your life.\"    \"What are you laughing at?\" asked Aline.    \"Nothing,\" said Joan. \"I was just thinking of something. There's  a young man who lives on the floor above this, and I was  lecturing him yesterday on enterprise. I told him to go and find  something exciting to do. I wonder what he would say if he knew  how thoroughly I am going to practice what I preach!\"        CHAPTER IV    In the morning following Aline's visit to Joan Valentine, Ashe  sat in his room, the Morning Post on the table before him. The  heady influence of Joan had not yet ceased to work within him;  and he proposed, in pursuance of his promise to her, to go  carefully through the columns of advertisements, however  pessimistic he might feel concerning the utility of that action.    His first glance assured him that the vast fortunes of the  philanthropists, whose acquaintance he had already made in print,  were not yet exhausted. Brian MacNeill still dangled his gold  before the public; so did Angus Bruce; so did Duncan Macfarlane  and Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They still had the  money and they still wanted to give it away.    Ashe was reading listlessly down the column when, from the mass  of advertisements, one of an unusual sort detached itself.       WANTED: Young Man of good appearance, who is poor and     reckless, to undertake a delicate and dangerous enterprise.     Good pay for the right man. Apply between the hours of ten     and twelve at offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole,     3, Denvers Street, Strand.    And as he read it, half past ten struck on the little clock on  his mantelpiece. It was probably this fact that decided Ashe. If  he had been compelled to postpone his visit to the offices of  Messrs. Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole until the afternoon, it is  possible that barriers of laziness might have reared themselves  in the path of adventure; for Ashe, an adventurer at heart, was  also uncommonly lazy. As it was, however, he could make an  immediate start.    Pausing but to put on his shoes, and having satisfied himself by  a glance in the mirror that his appearance was reasonably good,  he seized his hat, shot out of the narrow mouth of Arundell Street  like a shell, and scrambled into a taxicab, with the feeling  that--short of murder--they could not make it too delicate and  dangerous for him.    He was conscious of strange thrills. This, he told himself, was  the only possible mode of life with spring in the air. He had  always been partial to those historical novels in which the  characters are perpetually vaulting on chargers and riding across  country on perilous errands. This leaping into taxicabs to answer  stimulating advertisements in the Morning Post was very much the  same sort of thing. It was with fine fervor animating him that he  entered the gloomy offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole. His  brain was afire and he felt ready for anything.    \"I have come in ans--\" he began, to the diminutive office boy,  who seemed to be the nearest thing visible to a Mainprice or a  Boole.    \"Siddown. Gottatakeyerturn,\" said the office boy; and for the  first time Ashe perceived that the ante-room in which he stood  was crowded to overflowing.    This, in the circumstances, was something of a damper. He had  pictured himself, during his ride in the cab, striding into the  office and saying. \"The delicate and dangerous enterprise. Lead  me to it!\" He had not realized until now that he was not the only  man in London who read the advertisement columns of the Morning  Post, and for an instant his heart sank at the sight of all this  competition. A second and more comprehensive glance at his rivals  gave him confidence.    The Wanted column of the morning paper is a sort of dredger,  which churns up strange creatures from the mud of London's  underworld. Only in response to the dredger's operations do they  come to the surface in such numbers as to be noticeable, for as a  rule they are of a solitary habit and shun company; but when they  do come they bring with them something of the horror of the  depths.    It is the saddest spectacle in the world--that of the crowd  collected by a Wanted advertisement. They are so palpably not  wanted by anyone for any purpose whatsoever; yet every time they  gather together with a sort of hopeful hopelessness. What they  were originally--the units of these collections--Heaven knows.  Fate has battered out of them every trace of individuality. Each  now is exactly like his neighbor--no worse; no better.    Ashe, as he sat and watched them, was filled with conflicting  emotions. One-half of him, thrilled with the glamour of  adventure, was chafing at the delay, and resentful of these poor  creatures as of so many obstacles to the beginning of all the  brisk and exciting things that lay behind the mysterious brevity  of the advertisement; the other, pitifully alive to the tragedy  of the occasion, was grateful for the delay.    On the whole, he was glad to feel that if one of these derelicts  did not secure the \"good pay for the right man,\" it would not be  his fault. He had been the last to arrive, and he would be the  last to pass through that door, which was the gateway of  adventure--the door with Mr. Boole inscribed on its ground glass,  behind which sat the author of the mysterious request for  assistance, interviewing applicants. It would be through their  own shortcomings--not because of his superior attractions--if  they failed to please that unseen arbiter.    That they were so failing was plain. Scarcely had one scarred  victim of London's unkindness passed through before the bell  would ring; the office boy, who, in the intervals of frowning  sternly on the throng, as much as to say that he would stand no  nonsense, would cry, \"Next!\" and another dull-eyed wreck would  drift through, to be followed a moment later by yet another. The  one fact at present ascertainable concerning the unknown searcher  for reckless young men of good appearance was that he appeared to  be possessed of considerable decision of character, a man who did  not take long to make up his mind. He was rejecting applicants  now at the rate of two a minute.    Expeditious though he was, he kept Ashe waiting for a  considerable time. It was not until the hands of the fat clock  over the door pointed to twenty minutes past eleven that the  office boy's \"Next!\" found him the only survivor. He gave his  clothes a hasty smack with the palm of his hand and his hair a  fleeting dab to accentuate his good appearance, and turned the  handle of the door of fate.    The room assigned by the firm to their Mr. Boole for his personal  use was a small and dingy compartment, redolent of that  atmosphere of desolation which lawyers alone know how to achieve.  It gave the impression of not having been swept since the  foundation of the firm, in the year 1786. There was one small  window, covered with grime. It was one of those windows you see  only in lawyers' offices. Possibly some reckless Mainprice or  harebrained Boole had opened it in a fit of mad excitement  induced by the news of the Battle of Waterloo, in 1815, and had  been instantly expelled from the firm. Since then, no one had  dared to tamper with it.    Gazing through this window--or, rather, gazing at it, for X-rays  could hardly have succeeded in actually penetrating the alluvial  deposits on the glass--was a little man. As Ashe entered, he  turned and looked at him as though he hurt him rather badly in  some tender spot.    Ashe was obliged to own to himself that he felt a little nervous.  It is not every day that a young man of good appearance, who has  led a quiet life, meets face to face one who is prepared to pay  him well for doing something delicate and dangerous. To Ashe the  sensation was entirely novel. The most delicate and dangerous act  he had performed to date had been the daily mastication of Mrs.  Bell's breakfast--included in the rent. Yes, he had to admit  it--he was nervous: and the fact that he was nervous made him hot  and uncomfortable.    To judge him by his appearance, the man at the window was also  hot and uncomfortable. He was a little, truculent-looking man,  and his face at present was red with a flush that sat unnaturally  on a normally lead-colored face. His eyes looked out from under  thick gray eyebrows with an almost tortured expression. This was  partly owing to the strain of interviewing Ashe's preposterous  predecessors, but principally to the fact that the little man had  suddenly been seized with acute indigestion, a malady to which he  was peculiarly subject.    He removed from his mouth the black cigar he was smoking,  inserted a digestive tabloid, and replaced the cigar. Then he  concentrated his attention on Ashe. As he did so the hostile  expression of his face became modified. He looked surprised  and--grudgingly--pleased.    \"Well, what do you want?\" he said.    \"I came in answer to--\"    \"In answer to my advertisement? I had given up hope of seeing  anything part human. I thought you must be one of the clerks.  You're certainly more like what I advertised for. Of all the  seedy bunches of dead beats I ever struck, the aggregation I've  just been interviewing was the seediest! When I spend good money  in advertising for a young man of good appearance, I want a young  man of good appearance--not a tramp of fifty-five.\"    Ashe was sorry for his predecessors, but he was bound to admit  that they certainly had corresponded somewhat faithfully to the  description just given. The comparative cordiality of his own  reception removed the slight nervousness that had been troubling  him. He began to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#13)"],[1,"fail when the attempt is made to  homologise the structure of fishes with that of air-breathing  Vertebrates, for the homologies are anything but obvious and no  intermediate organs are found.    Most air-breathing Vertebrates have a larynx, a trachea, and bronchi,  which are absent in fish; and fish have many parts which seem to be  absent in higher Vertebrates. But apply the \"Theory of Analogues\"; it  teaches that there can be no organ peculiar to fish and not found in  other Vertebrates; apply the \"Principle of Connections,\" it will show  which organs are homologous in the two types (p. xxxv.).    Comparative anatomists, with few exceptions, had hitherto taken man as  the type, and referred all structure to his; Geoffroy's principles led  him to give preference to no one animal in particular, but to seize upon  each part in the species in which it reaches the maximum of its  development (p. xxxvi.). He is thus led to refer all structures to a  generalised abstract type. In this abstract type each organ exists at  the maximum of its development, each organ shows all its potentialities  realised. In a way, therefore, this type, this abstraction, gives the  scheme of the possible transformations of each organ.    It is true Geoffroy does not refer to this \"Archetype\" in so many words,  but it must always have been vaguely present in his mind. He has this  idea in his head when he says in one of his later works, \"There is,  philosophically speaking, only a single animal.\"[88] The \"single animal\"  is simply the generalised type.    Having laid down his two principles Geoffroy goes on to apply them to  the difficult case of the comparison of the skeleton of fish with the  skeleton of the higher Vertebrates. \"My present task is to demonstrate  that there is no part of the bony framework of fishes that cannot find  its analogue in the other vertebrated animals.\"[89] It seems at first  sight that many bones are peculiar to fish, formed expressly for  performing the functions which fish do not share with higher animals.  These are the bones connected with respiration--the operculum, the  branchiostegal rays, the branchial arches, and others. That the peculiar  bones should be connected with the respiratory functions is only  natural, for the contrast between fish and higher Vertebrates is  essentially a contrast between water-breathing and air-breathing  animals. Considering first the general form of the skeleton in fish, we  are met at once with a difficulty; there is no obvious homologue in  fishes of the neck, the trunk, and the abdomen of higher animals. What  apparently corresponds to the trunk is in fishes crowded close up under  the head. But, after all, it is not of the essence of the vertebrate  type to have the trunk and the abdomen attached at definite and  invariable distances along the vertebral column--that is a notion  surviving from the anatomy which made man its type. The \"trunk\" differs  in position according to the class, in quadrupeds, birds, and fishes (p.  9). Now, says Geoffroy, allow me this one hypothesis, that the trunk  with its organs can, as it were, move bodily along the vertebral column,  so as to be found in one class near the front end of the vertebral  column, in another about the middle, and in a third near the end, then I  can show you in detail that the constituent parts of this trunk are  found in all classes to be invariably in the same positions relatively  to one another (p. 10). It is important to note this hypothesis of a  \"metastasis\" which Geoffroy makes, for it is the key to the  understanding of many of the far-fetched homologies which he tries to  establish. It is, of course, clear that this hypothesis is in formal  contradiction with his principal hypothesis of the invariability of  connections, and that he, so to speak, gets a hold on his fish to apply  his principle of connections only by admitting at the very outset an  exception to his primary principle. A further application of the  hypothesis of metastasis will be noticed below in connection with the  determination of the sternum of fishes. We note here an interpretation  of the first metastasis in terms of functional adaptation. \"The constant  and violent action of the tail, if it does not go so far as actually to  displace and move forward the internal organs, at least fits in well  with an arrangement in which the organs are so disposed\" (p. 99).    The first memoir deals with the homologies of the opercular bones.  Geoffroy considers that the external opening of the ear corresponds to  the external opening of the gill-chamber, which lies between the  operculum and the pectoral girdle. The ear communicates with the buccal  cavity by the Eustachian tube, so does the branchial chamber by means of  the gill-slits. The auditory chamber of higher Vertebrates is,  therefore, the homologue of the branchial chamber in fish; the opercular  bones in fish and the ossicles of the ear in other Vertebrates stand in  close relation to this chamber; therefore the opercular bones are the  homologues of the ossicles of the ear, the interoperculum corresponding  to the malleus, the suboperculum to the lenticular, the minute lower  part of the suboperculum to the incus, the operculum to the stapes, and  the pre-operculum to the tympanic ring. In making these particular  determinations Geoffroy professes to be led by his principle of  connections. The pre-operculum has, he says, the same connections with  neighbouring bones as the tympanic bone in other Vertebrates, and the  other pieces of the gill-cover are homologised with particular  ear-ossicles according to the order in which they stand to one another.  The second memoir in the book deals with the sternum, and affords a very  good example of Geoffroy's method of dealing with the facts of  structure. We shall omit here any detailed reference to the other three  memoirs, which deal with the hyoid, with the branchial arches and the  structures which correspond in air-breathing Vertebrates, and with the  bones of the shoulder-girdle.    In the memoir on the sternum Geoffroy's first care is to arrive at a  definition of what a sternum is. He defines it partly by its functions,  partly by its connections, as the system of bones which covers and  protects the thorax, and gives attachment to certain groups of muscles.    The most highly developed sternum (according to this definition) is the  plastron of the tortoise, whose structure it dominates (p. 103). It is  important, therefore, to determine of how many bones the plastron is  composed, since the full number of elementary parts of which an organ is  composed is best seen when the organ is at the maximum of its  development. There are nine bones in the plastron of the tortoise. \"The  conclusion to be drawn from this is that every sternum, provided that it  is not inhibited in its development by some obstacle, is composed of  _nine elementary parts_\" (p. 105). These nine bones are in Geoffroy's  nomenclature, the episternals, the hyosternals, the hyposternals, the  xiphisternals, which are all paired bones, and the entosternal, which is  unpaired. The arrangement of them is in the tortoise:--    Episternal---------------------------Episternal      |\\__                               __/|      |   \\__                         __/   |      |      \\__                   __/      |      |         \\__ Entosternal __/         |      |       __/                 \\__       |      |    __/                       \\__    |      | __/                             \\__ |      |/                                   \\|  Hyosternal                           Hyosternal      |                                     |      |                                     |      |                                     |      |                                     |  Hyposternal-------------------------Hyposternal      |                                     |      |                                     |      |                                     |      |                                     |  Xiphisternal------------------------Xiphisternal.    The articulations in the tortoise are indicated by the connecting  lines. Geoffroy tries to show that the sternum in other animals is  composed of these nine bones, or at least of a certain number of them,  always in the same invariable relative positions. Thus in birds the  sternum consists of five pieces, of a huge keeled entosternal, and of  two \"annexes\" on either side, which are the hyo-and hyposternals.  These are separate only in young birds. Occasionally, especially in  young birds, rudiments of episternals and xiphisternals also occur.  The minuteness of the episternals and the xiphisternals may be  attributed to the gigantic size of the entosternal, in accordance with  the _Loi de balancement_. In the other air-breathing Vertebrates the  nine sternal elements can according to Geoffroy be discovered without  great difficulty. But when we come to the determination of the sternum  in fishes, difficulties abound, which Geoffroy solves in the following  way. He points out that between the clavicles (_cleithra_) and the  hyoid bone (_basihyal_) in fishes there is a long median bone  (_urohyal_) which is attached in front by two strong tendons to the  horns of the hyoid and is free behind (see Fig. 1). Gouan (1720) had  seen in this bone the homologue of the sternum. Geoffroy adopts this  view, but considers that this bone alone cannot represent the whole  sternum. He finds the representatives of other bones of the sternum in  the large bones (_epihyal_ and _ceratohyal_, or the two pieces of the  _ceratohyal_) which are comprised in the hyoid arch. But he is  immediately met by the difficulty that this complex of bones is  situated in front of the pectoral girdle, whereas the sternum in  higher Vertebrates lies behind the pectoral girdle. He reflects,  however, that the gills of fish, situated in front of the clavicles,  "]]]
