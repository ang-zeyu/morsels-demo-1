Once I saw him fishing in a peculiar way, which reminded me instantly of  the chumming process with which every mackerel fisherman on the coast is  familiar. He caught a pollywog for bait, with which he waded to a deep,  cool place under a shady bank. There he whacked his pollywog into small  bits and tossed them into the water, where the chum speedily brought a  shoal of little fish to feed. Quoskh meanwhile stood in the shadow,  where he would not be noticed, knee-deep in water, his head drawn down  into his shoulders, and a friendly leafy branch bending over him to  screen him from prying eyes. As a fish swam up to his chum he would  spear it like lightning; throw his head back and wriggle it head-first  down his long neck; then settle down to watch for the next one. And  there he stayed, alternately watching and feasting, till he had enough;  when he drew his head farther down into his shoulders, shut his eyes,  and went fast asleep in the cool shadows,--a perfect picture of fishing  indolence and satisfaction.           *       *       *       *       *    When I went to the nest and hid myself in the underbrush to watch, day  after day, I learned more of Quoskh's fishing and hunting. The nest was  in a great evergreen, in a gloomy swamp,--a villainous place of bogs and  treacherous footing, with here and there a little island of large trees.  On one of these islands a small colony of herons were nesting. During  the day they trailed far afield, scattering widely, each pair to its own  particular fishing grounds; but when the shadows grew long, and night  prowlers stirred abroad, the herons came trailing back again, making  curious, wavy, graceful lines athwart the sunset glow, to croak and be  sociable together, and help each other watch the long night out.    [Illustration]    Quoskh the Watchful--I could tell my great bird's mate by sight or  hearing from all others, either by her greater size or a peculiar double  croak she had--had hidden her nest in the top of a great green hemlock.  Near by, in the high crotch of a dead tree, was another nest, which she  had built, evidently, years before and added to each successive spring,  only to abandon it at last for the evergreen. Both birds used to go to  the old nest freely; and I have wondered since if it were not a bit of  great shrewdness on their part to leave it there in plain sight, where  any prowler might see and climb to it; while the young were securely  hidden, meanwhile, in the top of the near-by hemlock, where they could  see without being seen. Only at a distance could you find the nest. When  under the hemlock, the mass of branches screened it perfectly, and your  attention was wholly taken by the other nest, standing out in bold  relief in the dead tree-top.    Such wisdom, if wisdom it were and not chance, is gained only by  experience. It took at least one brood of young herons, sacrificed to  the appetite of lucivee or fisher, to teach Quoskh the advantage of that  decoy nest to tempt hungry prowlers upon the bare tree hole where she  could have a clear field to spear them with her powerful bill and beat  them down with her great wings before they should discover their  mistake.    By watching the birds through my glass as they came to the young, I  could generally tell what kind of game was afoot for their following.  Once a long snake hung from the mother bird's bill; once it was a bird  of some kind; twice she brought small animals, whose species I could not  make out in the brief moment of alighting on the nest's edge,--all these  besides the regular fare of fish and frogs, of which I took no account.  And then, one day while I lay in my hiding, I saw the mother heron slide  swiftly down from the nest, make a sharp wheel over the lake, and plunge  into the fringe of berry bushes on the shore after some animal that her  keen eyes had caught moving. There was a swift rustling in the bushes, a  blow of her wing to head off a runaway, two or three lightning thrusts  of her javelin beak; then she rose heavily, taking a leveret with her;  and I saw her pulling it to pieces awkwardly on the nest to feed her  hungry little ones.    It was partly to see these little herons, the thought of which had  fascinated me ever since I had seen Quoskh taking home what I thought,  at first glance, was a rag doll for them to play with, and partly to  find out more of Quoskh's hunting habits by seeing what he brought home,  that led me at last to undertake the difficult task of climbing the huge  tree to the nest. One day when the mother had brought home some unknown  small animal--a mink, I thought--I came suddenly out of my hiding and  crossed over to the nest. It had always fascinated me. Under it, at  twilight, I had heard the mother heron croaking softly to her little  ones--a husky lullaby, but sweet enough to them--and then, as I paddled  away, I would see the nest dark against the sunset with Mother Quoskh  standing over it, a tall, graceful silhouette against the glory of  twilight, keeping sentinel watch over her little ones. Now I would solve  the mystery of the high nest by looking into it.    The mother, alarmed by my sudden appearance,--she had no idea that she  had been watched,--shot silently away, hoping I would not notice her  home through the dense screen of branches. I climbed up with difficulty;  but not till I was within ten feet could I make out the mass of sticks  above me. The surroundings were getting filthy and evil-smelling by this  time; for Quoskh teaches the young herons to keep their nest perfectly  clean by throwing all refuse over the sides of the great home. A dozen  times I had watched the mother birds of the colony push their little  ones to the edge of the nest to teach them this rule of cleanliness, so  different from most other birds.    As I hesitated about pushing through the filth-laden branches, something  bright on the edge of the nest caught my attention. It was a young  heron's eye looking down at me over a long bill, watching my approach  with a keenness that was but thinly disguised by the half-drawn eyelids.  I had to go round the tree at this point for a standing on a larger  branch; and when I looked up, there was another eye watching down over  another long bill. So, however I turned, they watched me closely getting  nearer and nearer, till I reached up my hand to touch the nest. Then  there was a harsh croak. Three long necks reached down suddenly over the  edge of the nest on the side where I was; three long bills opened wide  just over my head; and three young herons grew suddenly seasick, as if  they had swallowed ipecac.    [Illustration]    I never saw the inside of that home. At the moment I was in too much of  a hurry to get down and wash in the lake; and after that, so large were  the young birds, so keen and powerful the beaks, that no man or beast  might expect to look over the edge of the nest, with hands or paws  engaged in holding on, and keep his eyes for a single instant. It is  more dangerous to climb for young herons than for young eagles. A heron  always strikes for the eye, and his blow means blindness or death,  unless you watch like a cat and ward it off.    When I saw the young again they were taking their first lessons. A  dismal croaking in the tree-tops attracted me, and I came over  cautiously to see what my herons were doing. The young were standing up  on the big nest, stretching necks and wings, and croaking hungrily;  while the mother stood on a tree-top some distance away, showing them  food and telling them plainly, in heron language, to come and get it.  They tried it after much coaxing and croaking; but their long, awkward  toes missed their hold upon the slender branch on which she was  balancing delicately--just as she expected it to happen. As they fell,  flapping lustily, she shot down ahead of them and led them in a long,  curving slant to an open spot on the shore. There she fed them with the  morsels she held in her beak; brought more food from a tuft of grass  where she had hidden it, near at hand; praised them with gurgling croaks  till they felt some confidence on their awkward legs; then the whole  family started up the shore on their first frogging expedition.    It was intensely interesting for a man who, as a small boy, had often  gone a-frogging himself--to catch big ones for a woodsy corn roast, or  little ones for pickerel bait--to sit now on a bog and watch the little  herons try their luck. Mother Quoskh went ahead cautiously, searching  the lily pads; the young trailed behind her awkwardly, lifting their  feet like a Shanghai rooster and setting them down with a splash to  scare every frog within hearing, exactly where the mother's foot had  rested a moment before. So they went on, the mother's head swinging like  a weather-vane to look far ahead, the little ones stretching their necks  so as to peek by her on either side, full of wonder at the new world,  full of hunger for things that grew there, till a startled young frog  said _K'tung!_ from behind a lily bud, where they did not see him, and  dove headlong into the mud, leaving a long, crinkly, brown trail to tell  exactly how far he had gone.    A frog is like an ostrich. When he sees nothing, because his head is  hidden, he thinks nothing can see him. At the sudden alarm Mother Quoskh  would stretch her neck, watching the frog's flight; then turn her head  so that her long bill pointed directly at the bump on the muddy bottom,  which marked the hiding place of Chigwooltz, and croak softly as a  signal. At the sound one of the young herons would hurry forward  eagerly; follow his mother's bill, which remained motionless, pointing  all the while; twist "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#13)"],[1,";  Fig. 39 (_b_) is a detail also copied from nature, but which might stand  without alteration provided it formed part of a work delicate enough  to note such close elaboration in so small a space. This, of course,  would entirely depend upon the purpose for which the carving was  intended, and whether it was meant for distant view or close inspection.  As there is arrangement necessary in forming the outline, so there is  just as much required in designing the articulation of the surfaces of  the leaves, which should be so treated that their hollows fall into a  semblance of some kind of pattern. Fig. 36 is a more formal design, or,  to use a very much abused word, more \"conventional,\" in which such  leafage as there is only serves the purpose of ornamental points,  marking the divisions of the general design. The gouge work upon the  leaves should be of the simplest description, but strict attention is  necessary in drawing the grooves, so that their forms may be clear and  emphatic, leaving no doubt as to the pattern intended. Designs of this  kind have no interest whatever except as pieces of patterned work, to  which end every other consideration should be sacrificed. It must not be  cut too deep--say 1/4 in. at the deepest--and the sides of the panels  should be very gently hollowed out with a flattish sweep (see section on  Fig. 37) in order to avoid any appearance of actual construction in  what more or less imitates the stiles and rails of a door. Fig. 37 shows  a portion of the leafage to a larger scale, and also a plan explaining  the construction of all these cupboards.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.]    [Illustration: FIG. 38.]    [Illustration: FIG. 39 (_a_).]    Fig. 40 is designed upon the barest suggestion of natural foliage, the  wavy stem being quite flat, and running out flush into the flat margins  at the sides, connecting them together. The leaves in this case should  be carved, leaving the veins standing solid; grooved veins would have a  meager look upon such rudimentary leaves. Of course a more natural  treatment may be given to this kind of design, but in that case it would  require to be carried all over the door, and replace the formally  ornamental center panel. The pierced pattern in cresting should be done  as already described for Fig. 24.    [Illustration: FIG. 39 (_b_).]    [Illustration: FIG. 40.]    [Illustration: FIG. 41]    Fig. 41 is a variant on the last design. In this case a little more play  of surface is attempted, making a point of carving the side lobes of  the leaves into little rounded masses which will reflect points of  light. This is shown better on Fig. 42.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.]    [Illustration: FIG. 43.]    In carving foliage like that of the vine, where small dark holes or eyes  occur, enough wood should be left round them to form deep dark little  pits. They are very valuable as points of shadow. In doing this, cut the  rim all round with a very slight bevel as in section, Fig. 43. Whenever  leaves run out to a fine edge they also should have a small bevel like  this in order to avoid an appearance of weakness which acute edges  always present. As a general rule leave as much wood as possible about  the edges of leaves as you want shadow from them--dipping them only  where you are sure the variety will be effective. In the execution of  bunches of rounded forms like grapes there is no special mechanical  expedient for doing them quickly and easily; each must be cut out  separately, and carved with whatever tools come handiest to their shape  and size. It is a good way to begin by cutting triangular holes between  the grapes with the point of a small chisel (see Fig. 44), after which  the rough shapes left may gradually be formed into ovals. When the work  is very simple in character, and does not require a realistic treatment,  the grapes may be done in a more methodical way, as in Fig. 45. First  cut grooves across both ways with a V tool, dividing the grapes as at _a  a_, then with a gouge turned hollow down round each line of grapes into  rolls as at _b b_. Do this both ways, and afterward finish the form as  best you can.

In holiday time, and as other opportunity arises, be sure to visit some  old building, be it church or mansion. In this way you will make  acquaintance with many a fine specimen of old work which will set your  fancy moving. In the one there may be a carved choir-screen or bench  ends, in the other a fireplace or table. The first sight of such things  in the places and among the surroundings for which they were designed,  is always an eventful moment in the training of a carver, because the  element of surprise acts like a tonic to the mind by arousing its  emulative instincts. It is by seeing such things in their proper home  and associations that the best lessons are learned. One sees in that  way, for instance, _why_ the tool marks left by the old carvers on their  work look more effective than smoothly perfect surfaces, when associated  with the rough timbers of the roof, or the uneven surface of the  plastered wall. One sees, too, the effect of time and friction in the  polished surfaces of bench ends, rubbed and dusted by countless hands  until they have become smooth to the eye and touch, and a mental note is  made to avoid sharp or spiky work in anything that is likely to be  within reach of the fingers. In this way a certain balance is given to  the judgment in proportioning to each piece of work its due share of  labor, and we come away with a fixed determination to pay more attention  in future to breadth of design and economy of actual carving, a problem  which no carver finds easy, but which must be faced if wasted work is  not to be his only reward.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.]    In museums, too, we shall find many useful lessons, although there we  see things huddled together in a distracting fashion which demands great  wariness of selection. The great point to be observed in making our  notes for future reference is, that each sketch should contain some  memorandum of a special quality, the one which attracted us at the time  of making it. One may be made for sake of a general arrangement, another  to remind us of some striking piece of detail or peculiarity of  execution. The drawings need not be elaborate or labored, provided they  make clear the points they were intended to record. Thus Fig. 46 is a  sketch which is meant as a memorandum of a lively representation of  birds, taken from an old Miserere seat. Fig. 47 was done for sake of the  rich effect of an inscription on the plain side of a beam, and also for  the peculiar and interesting section to which the beam had been cut.  Fig. 48, again, for sake of the arrangement of the little panels on a  plain surface, and the sense of fitness and proportion which prompted  the carver to dispose his work in that fashion, by which he has enriched  the whole surface at little cost of labor, and by contrast enhanced the  value of the little strips and diamonds of carved work, otherwise of no  particular interest. Figs. 49 and 50 are two sketches of Icelandic  carved boxes. Fig. 49 was drawn as an example of the rich effect which  that kind of engraved work may have, and of the use which it makes of  closely packed letters in the inscription. The pattern is, of course, a  traditional Norse one, although the carving is comparatively modern. The  points to be noted in the other box were its quaint and simple  construction, the use of the letters as decoration, more especially the  unpremeditated manner in which they have been grouped, the four letters  below making a short line which is eked out by a rude bit of ornament.  The letters are cut right through the wood, and are surrounded with an  engraved line. Fig. 51 was noted on account of the way in which a very  simple pierced ornament is made much of by repetition. The ornament is  on a Portuguese bed, and this is only a detail of a small portion. The  effect greatly depends upon the quantity, but in this case that is a  point which is easily remembered without drawing more of it than is  shown. The fact that this work is associated with richly turned  balusters is, however, noticed in the sketch, as that might easily be  forgotten. Figs. 47 to 51 are from South Kensington Museum.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.]    [Illustration: FIG. 48.]    [Illustration: FIG. 49.]    [Illustration: FIG. 50.]    [Illustration: FIG. 51.]    Then we come to the sketch of a chair (Fig. 52), or combined table and  chair. The richly carved back is pivoted, and forms the table top when  lowered over the arms, upon which it rests. The points to be noted in  this are, the general richness of effect, the contrast of wavy and rigid  lines, and the happy way in which the architectural suggestion of arch  and pillars has been translated into ornament. As this sketch was not  made so much for the chair itself as for its enriched back, no  measurements have been taken; otherwise chairs, as such, depend very  much upon exact dimensions for their proportions. This chair is at  Exning in Suffolk.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.]    Now we shall suppose that you are going to make many such sketches  both in museums and in country churches or houses. You will find some  too elaborate for drawings in the time at your disposal, in which case  you should obtain a photograph, if possible, making notes of any detail  which you wish particularly to remember--such, for instance, as the  carved chest shown in Plate I. The subject, St. George and the Dragon,  is given with various incidents all in the one picture. This is a  valuable and suggestive piece of work to have before"]]]
