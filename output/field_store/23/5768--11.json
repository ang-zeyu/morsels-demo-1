[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#13)"],[1," Lashmore--you have recently been present at a  spiritualistic _seance_.\"    She was past wondering at his power of inductive reasoning, and merely  nodded.    \"I suggest--I do not know--that the _seance_ was held under the  auspices of Mr. Antony Ferrara, ostensibly for amusement.\"    Another affirmative nod answered him.    \"You proved to be mediumistic?\"    It was admitted.    \"And now, Lady Lashmore\"--Dr. Cairn's face was very stern--\"I will  trouble you no further.\"    He prepared to depart; when--    \"Dr. Cairn!\" whispered Lady Lashmore, tremulously, \"some dreadful  thing, something that I cannot comprehend but that I fear and loathe  with all my soul, has come to me. Oh--for pity's sake, give me a word  of hope! Save for you, I am alone with a horror I cannot name. Tell  me--\"    At the door, he turned.    \"Be brave,\" he said--and went out.    Lady Lashmore sat still as one who had looked upon Gorgon, her  beautiful eyes yet widely opened and her face pale as death; for he  had not even told her to hope.           *       *       *       *       *    Robert Cairn was sitting smoking in the library, a bunch of notes  before him, when Dr. Cairn returned to Half-Moon Street. His face,  habitually fresh coloured, was so pale that his son leapt up in alarm.  But Dr. Cairn waved him away with a characteristic gesture of the  hand.    \"Sit down, Rob,\" he said, quietly; \"I shall be all right in a moment.  But I have just left a woman--a young woman and a beautiful  woman--whom a fiend of hell has condemned to that which my mind  refuses to contemplate.\"    Robert Cairn sat down again, watching his father.    \"Make out a report of the following facts,\" continued the latter,  beginning to pace up and down the room.    He recounted all that he had learnt of the history of the house of  Dhoon and all that he had learnt of recent happenings from Lord and  Lady Lashmore. His son wrote rapidly.    \"And now,\" said the doctor, \"for our conclusions. Mirza, the Polish  Jewess, who became Lady Lashmore in 1615, practised sorcery in life  and became, after death, a ghoul--one who sustained an unholy  existence by unholy means--a vampire.\"    \"But, sir! Surely that is but a horrible superstition of the Middle  Ages!\"    \"Rob, I could take you to a castle not ten miles from Cracow in Poland  where there are--certain relics, which would for ever settle your  doubts respecting the existence of vampires. Let us proceed. The son  of Mirza, Paul Dhoon, inherited the dreadful proclivities of his  mother, but his shadowy existence was cut short in the traditional,  and effective, manner. Him we may neglect.    \"It is Mirza, the sorceress, who must engage our attention. She was  decapitated by her husband. This punishment prevented her, in the  unhallowed life which, for such as she, begins after ordinary decease,  from practising the horrible rites of a vampire. Her headless body  could not serve her as a vehicle for nocturnal wanderings, but the  evil spirit of the woman might hope to gain control of some body more  suitable.    \"Nurturing an implacable hatred against all of the house of Dhoon,  that spirit, disembodied, would frequently be drawn to the  neighbourhood of Mirza's descendants, both by hatred and by affinity.  Two horrible desires of the Spirit Mirza would be gratified if a Dhoon  could be made her victim--the desire for blood and the desire for  vengeance! The fate of Lord Lashmore would be sealed if that spirit  could secure incarnation!\"    Dr. Cairn paused, glancing at his son, who was writing at furious  speed. Then--    \"A magician more mighty and more evil than Mirza ever was or could  be,\" he continued, \"a master of the Black Art, expelled a woman's  spirit from its throne and temporarily installed in its place the  blood-lustful spirit of Mirza!\"    \"My God, sir!\" cried Robert Cairn, and threw down his pencil. \"I begin  to understand!\"    \"Lady Lashmore,\" said Dr. Cairn, \"since she was weak enough to  consent to be present at a certain _seance_, has, from time to time,  been _possessed_; she has been possessed by the spirit of a vampire!  Obedient to the nameless cravings of that control, she has sought out  Lord Lashmore, the last of the House of Dhoon. The horrible attack  made, a mighty will which, throughout her temporary incarnation, has  held her like a hound in leash, has dragged her from her prey, has  forced her to remove, from the garments clothing her borrowed body,  all traces of the deed, and has cast her out again to the pit of  abomination where her headless trunk was thrown by the third Baron  Lashmore!    \"Lady Lashmore's brain retains certain memories. They have been  received at the moment when possession has taken place and at the  moment when the control has been cast out again. They thus are  memories of some secret cavern near Dhoon Castle, where that headless  but deathless body lies, and memories of the poignant moment when the  vampire has been dragged back, her 'thirst unslaked,' by the ruling  Will.\"    \"Merciful God!\" muttered Robert Cairn, \"Merciful God, can such things  be!\"    \"They can be--they are! Two ways have occurred to me of dealing with  the matter,\" continued Dr. Cairn quietly. \"One is to find that cavern  and to kill, in the occult sense, by means of a stake, the vampire who  lies there; the other which, I confess, might only result in the  permanent 'possession' of Lady Lashmore--is to get at the power which  controls this disembodied spirit--kill Antony Ferrara!\"    Robert Cairn went to the sideboard, and poured out brandy with a  shaking hand.    \"What's his object?\" he whispered.    Dr. Cairn shrugged his shoulders.    \"Lady Lashmore would be the wealthiest widow in society,\" he replied.    \"_He_ will know now,\" continued the younger man unsteadily, \"that you  are up against him. Have you--\"    \"I have told Lord Lashmore to lock, at night, not only his outer door  but also that of his dressing-room. For the rest--?\" he dropped into  an easy-chair,--\"I cannot face the facts, I--\"    The telephone bell rang.    Dr. Cairn came to his feet as though he had been electrified; and as  he raised the receiver to his ear, his son knew, by the expression on  his face, from where the message came and something of its purport.    \"Come with me,\" was all that he said, when he had replaced the  instrument on the table.    They went out together. It was already past midnight, but a cab was  found at the corner of Half-Moon Street, and within the space of five  minutes they were at Lord Lashmore's house.    Excepting Chambers, Lord Lashmore's valet, no servants were to be  seen.    \"They ran away, sir, out of the house,\" explained the man, huskily,  \"when it happened.\"    Dr. Cairn delayed for no further questions, but raced upstairs, his  son close behind him. Together they burst into Lord Lashmore's  bedroom. But just within the door they both stopped, aghast.    Sitting bolt upright in bed was Lord Lashmore, his face a dingy grey  and his open eyes, though filming over, yet faintly alight with a  stark horror ... dead. An electric torch was still gripped in his left  hand.    Bending over someone who lay upon the carpet near the bedside they  perceived Sir Elwin Groves. He looked up. Some little of his usual  self-possession had fled.    \"Ah, Cairn!\" he jerked. \"We've both come too late.\"    The prostrate figure was that of Lady Lashmore, a loose kimono worn  over her night-robe. She was white and still and the physician had  been engaged in bathing a huge bruise upon her temple.    \"She'll be all right,\" said Sir Elwin; \"she has sustained a tremendous  blow, as you see. But Lord Lashmore--\"    Dr. Cairn stepped closer to the dead man.    \"Heart,\" he said. \"He died of sheer horror.\"    He turned to Chambers, who stood in the open doorway behind him.    \"The dressing-room door is open,\" he said. \"I had advised Lord  Lashmore to lock it.\"    \"Yes, sir; his lordship meant to, sir. But we found that the lock had  been broken. It was to have been replaced to-morrow.\"    Dr. Cairn turned to his son.    \"You hear?\" he said. \"No doubt you have some idea respecting which of  the visitors to this unhappy house took the trouble to break that  lock? It was to have been replaced to-morrow; hence the tragedy of  to-night.\" He addressed Chambers again. \"Why did the servants leave  the house to-night?\"    The man was shaking pitifully.    \"It was the laughter, sir! the laughter! I can never forget it! I was  sleeping in an adjoining room and I had the key of his lordship's door  in case of need. But when I heard his lordship cry out--quick and  loud, sir--like a man that's been stabbed--I jumped up to come to him.  Then, as I was turning the doorknob--of my room, sir--someone,  something, began to _laugh_! It was in here; it was in here,  gentlemen! It wasn't--her ladyship; it wasn't like _any_ woman. I  can't describe it; but it woke up every soul in the house.\"    \"When you came in?\"    \"I daren't come in, sir! I ran downstairs and called up Sir Elwin  Groves. Before he came, all the rest of the household huddled on their  clothes and went away--\"    \"It was I who found him,\" interrupted Sir Elwin--\"as you see him now;  with Lady Lashmore where she lies. I have 'phoned for nurses.\"    \"Ah!\" said Dr. Cairn; \"I shall come back, Groves, but I have a small  matter to attend to.\"    He drew his son from the room. On the stair:    \"You understand?\" he asked. \"The spirit of Mirza came to him again,  clothed in his wife's body. Lord Lashmore felt the teeth at his  throat, awoke instantly and struck out. As he did so, he turned the  torch upon her, and recognised--his wife! His heart completed the  tragedy, and so--to the laughter of the sorceress--passed the last of  the house of Dhoon.\"    The cab was waiting. Dr. Cairn gave an address in Piccadilly, and the  two entered. As the cab moved off, the doctor took a revolver from his  pocket, with some loose cartridges, charged the five chambers, and  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#13)"],[1,"he galloped madly along the shore of the lake hoping in this way to ward  off the strange sleep. But the moment the nine peafowl appeared in the  sky he was so delighted that he drew rein and the treacherous serving  man was able to slip up behind him and blow the magic bellows on his  neck. So again he slept soundly while the ninth peafowl fluttered about  his head and tried vainly to arouse him.    As she was flying away she said to the serving man:    \"Tell your master that now he will never find me unless he strikes off  the head from the nail.\"    When the Prince awoke the serving man delivered this message.    \"What can she mean?\" the Prince said.    He looked hard at the serving man and something in the fellow's  appearance made him suspect treachery.    \"You know more than you're telling me!\" the Prince cried, and taking the  cowardly fellow by the throat he shook him and choked him until he had  got the truth out of him.    \"Ha!\" cried the Prince. \"Now I understand! You are the nail of which my  dear love warns me!\"    The fellow whined and begged for mercy but the Prince with one blow of  his sword struck off his head. Then, leaving the body where it fell for  the old woman to bury, he mounted his horse and again set forth on his  quest.    Everywhere he went he made inquiries about the nine enchanted peafowl  and everywhere people shook their heads and said they had never heard of  them. At last high up in a wild mountain he found an old hermit who  knew all about them.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"you mean the nine princesses. Eight of them have broken  the enchantment that held them and are now happily married. The ninth  awaits you. She is living in the royal palace of a beautiful city that  lies three days' journey to the north of this mountain. When you find  her, if you do just as she says she, too, will soon be free of all  enchantment. Then she will be made queen.\"    The Prince thanked the hermit and rode on. After three days he came to  the city of which the hermit had told him. He made his way to the palace  and into the Princess's presence. Sure enough the Princess was his own  dear love. She received him with joy, promised soon to marry him, and  gave over to him the keys of the palace.    \"You shall now be master here,\" she told him, \"to go where you like and  do as you like. There is only one thing that you must not do, only one  place where you must not go. Under the palace are twelve cellars. Here  are the keys to them all. Go into eleven of them whenever you will but  you must never open the door of the twelfth one. If you do a heavy  misfortune may fall upon both of us.\"    One day while the Princess was walking in the garden, the young Prince  thought he would go through the cellars. So, taking the keys, he  unlocked the cellars one after another until he had seen eleven of them.  Then he stood before the door of the twelfth wondering why the Princess  had warned him not to open it.    \"I'll open it just a little,\" he thought to himself. \"If there's  something inside that tries to get out, I'll close it quickly.\"    So he took the twelfth key, unlocked the twelfth door, and peeped inside  the twelfth cellar. It was empty except for one huge cask with an open  bunghole.    \"I don't see anything in here to be afraid of,\" he said.    Just then he heard a groan from inside the cask and a voice called out  in a begging, whining tone:    \"A cup of water, brother! A cup of water! I am dying of thirst!\"    Now the Prince thought to himself that it was a terrible thing for any  living creature to be dying of thirst. So he hurried out, got a cup of  water, and poured it into the open bunghole. Instantly one of the three  iron hoops that bound the cask burst asunder and the voice inside the  cask said:    \"Thank you, brother! Thank you! Now give me another cup! I am dying of  thirst!\"    So the Prince poured in a second cup and the second iron hoop snapped  apart and when the voice still begged for more water he poured in a  third cup. The third hoop broke, the staves of the cask fell in, and a  horrid dragon sprang out. Before the Prince could move, he had flown  through the door of the twelfth cellar into the eleventh cellar, then  into the tenth cellar, the ninth cellar, the eight cellar, the seventh  cellar, the sixth, the fifth, the fourth, the third, the second, the  first, and so out into the garden. The Prince reached the garden just in  time to see the monster overpower the Princess.    \"Alas, my dear one, what have you done?\" cried the poor Princess as the  dragon carried her off. \"The enchantment would soon have been broken and  I could have married you if only you had not gone into the twelfth  cellar!\"    Heartbroken at what had happened, the Prince mounted his horse and  started off in pursuit of the dragon.    \"I must do what I can to rescue my loved one,\" he said, \"even if it  costs me my life.\"    He rode many days until he came to the castle of the dragon. The dragon  was out and the Princess received him with tears of joy.    \"Come,\" he said to her, \"let us escape before the dragon returns.\"    The Princess sighed and shook her head.    \"How, my loved one, can we escape? The dragon rides a magic horse and  however fast we go he will be able to overtake us.\"    But the Prince insisted that they make the attempt. So she mounted with  him and off they went.    When the dragon arrived home and found her gone, he laughed a brutal  laugh and said to his horse:    \"I suppose that foolish young Prince has been here and is trying to  carry her off. Shall we start after them now or wait till we've had our  supper?\"    \"We might as well eat,\" the horse said, \"for we'll overtake them  anyway.\"    So they both ate and then the dragon mounted the magic horse and in no  time at all they had overtaken the fugitives.    \"I ought to tear you to pieces,\" the dragon said to the Prince, \"but I  won't this time because you gave me a cup of water. However, I warn you  not to try this foolishness again!\"    With that he clutched the poor weeping Princess in his scaly arms and  carried her back to the castle.    What was the Prince to do now? He tried to plan some other way of  rescuing the Princess but he could think of none. In spite of the  dragon's threat he went back the next day and tried the same thing  again. Again the dragon overtook him and snatched back the Princess.    \"I have spared you one time,\" he said to the Prince, \"and I will spare  you this one time more for the sake of the water you gave me. But I warn  you if you come again I will tear you to pieces.\"    But what man worthy the name will accept such a warning when the safety  and happiness of his loved one is concerned? The next day while the  dragon was out the Prince again returned to the castle.    \"It is plain,\" he said to the Princess, \"that we can never escape until  we, too, get a magic horse. We must find out where the dragon got his.  To-night when he comes home, speak him fair and caress his head and when  he is in fine humor ask him about his horse--what kind of a horse it is  and where he got it. Then I will come back to-morrow at this same hour  and you can tell me.\"    So that night when the dragon came home the Princess allowed him to put  his head in her lap and she scratched him softly behind the ears and  petted him until he was purring like a giant cat.    \"Urrh! Urrh! Urrh!\" purred the dragon. \"How happy we are here, just you  and I! What a foolish young man that Prince of yours is to think I'd let  him carry you off! Urrh! Urrh! Urrh!\"    \"Yes,\" the Princess agreed, \"he is foolish or he would never suppose his  horse could outrace yours.\"    \"Urrh! Urrh!\" the dragon purred. \"You're right! He seems to think my  horse is an ordinary horse. Why, I got my horse from the Old Woman of  the Mountain and the only other horse in the world that can outstrip him  is another horse that the Old Woman still has. The Prince would have a  hard time getting him!\"    The Princess still scratching the dragon behind his ears, just where he  loved it most, asked softly:    \"Why?\"    \"Urrh! Urrh! Urrh! Because the Old Woman will never give that horse away  until a man comes along who is able to guard for three nights in  succession the Old Woman's mare and foal. Any one who attempts this and  fails she kills. But even if a man were to succeed he would never get  the right horse for the old witch would palm off another on him. Urrh!  Urrh! Urrh! Oh, that feels good, my dear!\"    \"How would she do that?\" the Princess asked.    \"Urrh! Urrh! Urrh! You see she says to every man who undertakes to guard  the mare: 'If you succeed you may have any horse in my stable.' Then she  shows him twelve beautiful stallions with shiny coats, but she doesn't  show him a scrawny miserable looking beast that lies neglected on the  dung heap. Yet this is the magic horse and brother to mine.\"    Now the Princess knew all she needed to know and the next day when the  Prince came she told him what the dragon had said. So the Prince at once  set out to find the Old Woman of the Mountain.    He traveled three days over waste places and through strange lands. On  the first day as he was riding along the shores of a lake he heard a  little voice crying out:    \"Help me, brother, help me and--who knows?--some day I may help you!\"    The Prince looked down and saw a fish that was floundering on the sand.  He dismounted to get the fish and throw it back into the water.    \"Take one of my scales,\" the fish said. \"Then if ever you need my help  just rub the scale.\"    So the Prince, before he threw the fish into the lake, scraped off a  scale and tied it in a corner of his handkerchief. Then he rode on.    The second day a fox that had been caught in a trap called out to him:    \"Help me, brother, help me and--who knows?--some day I may help you!\"    The Prince opened the trap and the fox, before it limped away, gave the  Prince one of its hairs and said:    \"I"]]]
