Even his eyeballs ached as he struggled to turn the tiny  eye muscles from dial to dial, and his voice was a dim croak: \"Fourteen  seven sidereal twelve point one one four nine....\"    \"Hold it to point one one four six,\" Vorongil said calmly.    \"Point one one four six,\" Bart said, and his claws stabbed at dials.  Suddenly, in spite of the cold weight on his chest, the pain, the  struggle, he felt as if he were floating. He managed a long, luxurious  breath. He _could_ handle it. He knew what he was doing.    _He was an Astrogator...._    Later, when Acceleration One had reached its apex and the artificial  gravity made the ship a place of comfort again, he went down to the  dining hall with Ringg and met the crew of the _Swiftwing_. There were  twelve officers and twelve crewmen of various ratings like himself and  Ringg, but there seemed to be little social division between them, as  there would have been on a human ship; officers and crew joked and  argued without formality of any kind.    None of them gave him a second look. Later, in the Recreation Lounge,  Ringg challenged him to a game with one of the pinball machines. It  seemed fairly simple to Bart; he tried it, and to his own surprise, won.    Old Rugel touched a lever at the side of the room. With a tiny whishing  sound, shutters opened, the light of Procyon Alpha flooded them and he  looked out through a great viewport into bottomless space.    Procyon Alpha, Beta and Gamma hung at full, rings gently tilted. Beyond  them the stars burned, flaming through the shimmers of cosmic dust. The  colors, the never-ending colors of space!    And he stood here, in a room full of monsters--_he was one of the  monsters_--    \"Which one of the planets was it we stopped on?\" Rugel asked. \"I can't  tell 'em apart from this distance.\"    Bartol swallowed; he had almost said _the blue one_. He pointed.  \"The--the big one there, with the rings almost edge-on. I think they  call it Alpha.\"    \"It's their planet,\" said Rugel. \"I guess they can call it what they  want to. How about another game?\"    Resolutely, Bart turned his back on the bewitching colors, and bent over  the pinball machine.           *       *       *       *       *    The first week in space was a nightmare of strain. He welcomed the hours  on watch in the drive room; there alone he was sure of what he was  doing. Everywhere else in the ship he was perpetually scared,  perpetually on tiptoe, perpetually afraid of making some small and  stupid mistake. Once he actually called Aldebaran a red star, but Rugel  either did not hear the slip or thought he was repeating what one of the  Mentorians--there were two aboard besides the girl--had said.    The absence of color from speech and life was the hardest thing to get  used to. Every star in the manual was listed by light-frequency waves,  to be checked against a photometer for a specific reading, and it almost  drove Bart mad to go through the ritual when the Mentorians were off  duty and could not call off the color and the equivalent frequency type  for him. Yet he did not dare skip a single step, or someone might have  guessed that he could _see_ the difference between a yellow and a green  star before checking them.    The Academy ships had had the traditional human signal system of  flashing red lights. Bart was stretched taut all the time, listening for  the small codelike buzzers and ticks that warned him of filled tanks,  leads in need of servicing, answers ready. Ringg's metal-fatigues  testing kit was a bewildering muddle of boxes, meters, rods and  earphones, each buzzing and clicking its characteristic warning.    At first he felt stretched to capacity every waking moment, his memory  aching with a million details, and lay awake nights thinking his mind  would crack under the strain. Then Alpha faded to a dim bluish shimmer,  Beta was eclipsed, Gamma was gone, Procyon dimmed to a failing spark;  and suddenly Bart's memory accustomed itself to the load, the new habits  were firmly in place, and he found himself eating, sleeping and working  in a settled routine.    He belonged to the _Swiftwing_ now.    Procyon was almost lost in the viewports when a sort of upswept tempo  began to run through the ship, an undercurrent of increased activity.  Cargo was checked, inventoried and strapped in. Ringg was given four  extra men to help him, made an extra tour of the ship, and came back  buzzing like a frantic cricket. Bart's computers told him they were  forging toward the sidereal location assigned for the first of the  warp-drive shifts, which would take them some fifteen light-years toward  Aldebaran.    On the final watch before the warp-drive shift, the medical officer came  around and relieved the Mentorians from duty. Bart watched them go, with  a curious, cold, crawling apprehension. Even the Mentorians, trusted by  the Lhari--even these were put into cold-sleep! Fear grabbed his  insides.    _No human had ever survived the shift into warp-drive_, the Lhari said.  Briscoe, his father, Raynor Three--they thought they had proved that the  Lhari lied. If they were right, if it was a Lhari trick to reinforce  their stranglehold on the human worlds and keep the warp-drive for  themselves, then Bart had nothing to fear. But he was afraid.    Why did the Mentorians endure this, never quite trusted, isolated among  aliens?    Raynor Three had said, _Because I belong in space, because I'm never  happy anywhere else_. Bart looked out the viewport at the swirl and burn  of the colors there. Now that he could never speak of the colors, it  seemed he had never been so wholly and wistfully aware of them. They  symbolized the thing he could never put into words.    _So that everyone can have this. Not just the Lhari._    Rugel watched the Mentorians go, scowling. \"I wish medic would find a  way to keep them alive through warp,\" he said. \"My Mentorian assistant  could watch that frequency-shift as we got near the bottom of the arc,  and I'll bet she could _see_ it. They can see the changes in intensity  faster than I can plot them on the photometer!\"    Bart felt goosebumps break out on his skin. Rugel spoke as if the  certain death of humans, Mentorians, was a fact. Didn't the Lhari  themselves know it was a farce? _Or was it?_    Vorongil himself took the controls for the surge of Acceleration Two,  which would take them past the Light Barrier. Bart, watching his  instruments to exact position and time, saw the colors of each star  shift strangely, moment by moment. The red stars seemed hard to see. The  orange-yellow ones burned suddenly like flame; the green ones seemed  golden, the blue ones almost green. Dimly, he remembered the old story  of a \"red shift\" in the lights of approaching stars, but here he saw it  pure, a sight no human eyes had ever seen. A sight that _no_ eyes had  seen, human or otherwise, for the Lhari could not see it....    \"Time,\" he said briefly to Vorongil, \"Fifteen seconds....\"    Rugel looked across from his couch. Bart felt that the old, scarred  Lhari could read his fear. Rugel said through a wheeze, \"No matter how  old you get, Bartol, you're still scared when you make a warp-shift. But  relax, computers don't make mistakes.\"    \"Catalyst,\" Vorongil snapped, \"Ready--_shift!_\"    At first there was no change; then Bart realized that the stars, through  the viewport, had altered abruptly in size and shade and color. They  were not sparks but strange streaks, like comets, crossing and  recrossing long tails that grew, longer and longer, moment by moment.  The dark night of space was filled with a crisscrossing blaze. They were  moving faster than light, they saw the light left by the moving Universe  as each star hurled in its own invisible orbit, while they tore  incredibly through it, faster than light itself....    Bart felt a curious, tingling discomfort, deep in his flesh; almost an  itching, a stinging in his very bones.    _Lhari flesh is no different from ours...._    Space, through the viewport, was no longer space as he had come to know  it, but a strange eerie limbo, the star-tracks lengthening, shifting  color until they filled the whole viewport with shimmering, gray,  recrossing light. The unbelievable reaction of warp-drive thrust them  through space faster than the lights of the surrounding stars, faster  than imagination could follow.    The lights in the drive chamber began to dim--or was he blacking out?  The stinging in his flesh was a clawed pain.    Briscoe lived through it....    _They say._    The whirling star-tracks fogged, coiled, turned colorless worms of  light, went into a single vast blur. Dimly Bart saw old Rugel slump  forward, moaning softly; saw the old Lhari pillow his bald head on his  veined arms. Then darkness took him; and thinking it was death, Bart  felt only numb, regretful failure. _I've failed, we'll always fail. The  Lhari were right all long._    _But we tried! By God, we tried!_    \"Bartol?\" A gentle hand, cat claws retracted, came down on his shoulder.  Ringg bent over him. Good-natured rebuke was in his voice. \"Why didn't  you tell us you got a bad reaction, and ask to sign out for this shift?\"  he demanded. \"Look, poor old Rugel's passed out again. He just won't  admit he can't take it--but one idiot on a watch is enough! Some people  just feel as if the bottom's dropped out of the ship, and that's all  there is to it.\"    Bart hauled his head upright, fighting a surge of stinging nausea. His  bones itched inside and he was damnably uncomfortable, but he was alive.    \"I'm--fine.\"    \"You look it,\" Ringg said in derision. \"Think you can help me get Rugel  to his cabin?\"    Bart struggled to his feet, and found that when he was upright he felt  better. \"Wow!\" he muttered, then clamped his mouth shut. He was supposed  to be an experienced man, a Lhari hardened to space. He said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#13)"],[1,"amongst all the registers of the parishes for the proof of my marriage;  that he warned us to be on our guard, and that whatever diligence he  might be desired to employ, he should do nothing without informing us.  We felt the obligation of this proceeding, and my brother-in-law thanked  the attorney-general in my name as well as in his own. He told him that  it was not at Toulouse that the parties interested should make their  researches for my marriage certificate, but at Paris, either at the  parish church of Saint Laurent, or at the notary's, Lepot d'Auteuil. M.  de Bonrepos gave part of this reply to the duchesse de Grammont. Great  was the bustle amongst the Choiseuls! I leave you to judge of the  fury of the lady or ladies, for the contesse de Grammont was no less  irritated than the other, always prepossessed with the idea, that to  please the king was to wrong their family. The comtesse de Grammont had  not half the talent of the duchesse, she had only her faults. She  showed herself so rude and impertinent towards me, that I was at length  compelled, not to exile her of my own accord, but to allow that she  should be so served. But I anticipate, for this did not occur until the  following year.    The king by all his kindnesses endeavored to recompense me for these  attacks: he appeared charmed to see me surrounded by my husband's  family. He placed amongst the pages the vicomte Adolphe du Barry, son of  comte Jean, a young man of great promise, but whose destiny was so brief  and so unfortunate. My husband's family testified much affection for  me, as did the duc d'Aiguillon, to whom I daily attached myself. He  carefully kept from me all that could give me pain, and took a thousand  precautions that no unpleasant reports should reach me. If we passed a  short time without meeting he wrote to me, and I confess I was delighted  with a correspondence which formed my own style. Mademoiselle Chon, my  sister-in-law, and I also wrote to each other, and that from one room to  another. I remember that one day, having broken a glass of rock crystal  which she had given me, I announced my misfortune in such solemn style,  and with so well feigned a tone of chagrin, that the letter amused the  whole family. The king saw it, and was so much pleased that he kept it,  and next day sent me a golden goblet enriched with stones, which I gave  to Chon, to whom it rightfully belonged.        CHAPTER VI      Journey to Choisy--The comtesse du Barry and Louis XV--The king of  Denmark--The czar Peter--Frederick II--The abbe de la Chapelle--An  experiment--New intrigues--Secret agents-The comtesse and Louis  XV--Of the presentation--Letter of the comtesse to the duc  d'Aiguillon--Reply--Prince de Soubise    Up to this period I had resided constantly at Versailles or Paris,  according to the pleasure of the king, but had never followed his  majesty in any of his journeys. He wished to pass some days at his  delightful chateau at Choisy, situated on the banks of the Seine. It was  decided that I should be of the party, taking the name of the baroness  de Pamklek, a German lady, as that would save me from the embarrassment  in which I should be placed with the king in consequence of my  non-presentation. The prince de Soubise, the ducs de la Trimoulle,  d'Ayen, d'Aiguillon, and the marquis de Chauvelin, were also to attend  the king. The king remained nearly the whole time with me, and the  _entree_ to my apartment became a favor not accorded to every body.  A small committee met there, and talked of every thing except what is  rational; and I can assure you that with such conversation time passes  very quickly.    One day the king entered my apartment holding in his hand a letter.    \"I am about to receive,\" said he, \"a visit that will not give me much  pleasure. My brother of Denmark is traversing Europe, and is about  to come to France. _Mon Dieu_! what inconvenient persons are your  travelling kings! Why do they leave their kingdoms? I think they are  very well at home.\"    \"Yes, sire, but there is an excuse for them: they are weary of admiring  your majesty at a distance, and wish for the happiness of knowing you.\"    At this compliment the king rubbed his hands with a smile, which he  always did when he was satisfied, and then said,    \"There is not in the hearts of foreign potentates the same affection  towards my person as you feel. It is not me but France they wish to see.  I remember that when very young I received a visit from the czar Peter  the Great, Peter the First I mean to say. He was not deficient in sense,  but yet behaved like a boor: he passed his time in running over the  academies, libraries, and manufactories: I never saw such an ill-bred  man. Imagine him embracing me at our first interview, and carrying me in  his arms as one of my valets would have done. He was dirty, coarse,  and ill-dressed. Well, all the Frenchmen ran after him; one would  have supposed by their eagerness that they had never seen a regal  countenance.\"    \"Yet there was no occasion to run very far to see the handsome face of a  king.\"    \"Hold your tongue, madame la baronne de Pamklek, you are a flatterer.  There is a crowned head which for thirty years has desired to visit  France, but I have always turned a deaf ear, and will resist it as long  as possible.\"    \"Who, sire, is the king so unfortunate as to banished by you from your  majesty's presence?\"    \"Who? The king of philosophers, the rival of Voltaire, my brother of  Prussia. Ah, my dear baronne, he is a bad fellow; he detests me, and I  have no love for him. A king does wisely, certainly, to submit his works  to the judgment of a Freron! It would be outrageous scandal if he came  here. Great and small would crowd around him, and there would not be  twenty persons in my train.\"    \"Ah! sire, do you think so?\"    \"I am sure of it. The French now-a-days do not care for their kings,  and _la Fronde_ will be renewed at an early day. After all, philosophers  believe that Frederick II protects them: the honest man laughs both at  them and me.\"    \"At you, sire? Impossible.\"    \"No, no; I know the impertinences he is guilty of towards me: but let  him. I prefer making my court to the pretty women of my kingdom instead  of to my pages. You may depend upon it that if he came to Versailles he  would debauch some of them.\"    The king, charmed at having said this malicious speech, rubbed his hands  again.    \"Really, sire,\" I replied, \"I am astonished that this prince, having  such disgusting inclinations, can have much _eclat_ attached to his  name.\"    \"Ah, that is because he has great qualities: he will not allow himself  to be cheated. Do you know that he is acquainted with the disposal of  his finances to the last farthing?\"    \"Sire, he must be a miser.\"    \"No, madame, he is a man of method. But enough of him. As to his majesty  of Denmark, altho' he would have been as welcome to stay at home, I  shall receive him with as much attention as possible. The kings of  Denmark and Sweden are my natural allies.\"    The king changed the subject, and said, \"There is an abbe, named la  Chapelle, whom I think half cracked. He flatters himself that he can,  thro' the medium of some apparatus, remain on the water without sinking.  He begs my permission to exhibit his experiment before me; and if it  would amuse you, we will have the exhibition to-morrow.\" I accepted the  king's proposal with pleasure.    On the next day we went in a body to the terrace of the chateau. The  king was near me with his hat in his hand; the duc de Duras gave me his  arm. M. l'abbe waited us in a boat: he flung himself bodily into the  water, dressed in a sort of cork-jacket, moved in any direction in the  water, drank, ate, and fired off a gun. So far all went off well, but  the poor abbe, to close the affair, wrote a letter to the king. The  letter was carried in great pomp to his majesty. It contained two verses  of Racine, which had some double allusion to the experiment. This, you  may be sure, was interpreted in the worst manner. The duc d'Ayen gave  the finishing stroke to the whole, on his opinion being asked by the  king.    \"Sire,\" said he, \"such men ought to be thrown into the water; but all we  can wish for them is, that they should remain there.\"    The abbe was not more fortunate in the evening. He presented himself at  supper, but the king did not address a word to him, and he was compelled  to bear the malicious jokes of the courtiers. But let us leave Choisy  and the experimentalist, and return to Versailles and myself.    My friends were excessively desirous for my presentation, which would  decide my position at the chateau. As yet I only had an equivocal  existence, having rank neither at play, theatre, or public festival; so  that if the king should be capricious I could be dismissed as one of  the demoiselles of the _Parc-aux-Cerfs_. The duc d'Aiguillon, whose  attachment to me increased, calculated accurately all the advantages of  this presentation. It would place me on the same footing with madame de  Pompadour, and compel the ministers to come and work with me. The duke  did not doubt but that M. de Choiseul would refuse to pay his _devoirs_  to me, and that his resistance would lead to his fall. But for my  presentation, it was necessary not only that the king should consent,  for of that I was certain, but that he should desire it, and his desire  could not be depended on.    Louis XV was excessively timid: with an air which appeared of a  dreadnaught quality, he was fearful at heart. The clamors of Versailles  kept him in alarm; and he kept at his own court and at foreign courts  secret agents, whose only care was to report to him the complaints  of the people and the sarcasms and satires of society. The king was  attached to them; and when the force of circumstances compelled him to  abandon them, he still supported them clandestinely with all his power.  A proof of what I"]]]
