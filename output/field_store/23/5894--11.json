The names of some great masters are omitted, for I have no wish to  overload the margin of a statement which should be kept clear and  convenient of access. I trust nevertheless that these few notes in concise  form will be of use in connection with the preceding text.      I. BEFORE THE INTERVENTION OF BUDDHISM      The _Bas-reliefs_ of the second Han dynasty belong to the second and        third centuries of the Christian era.      _Ku K'ai-chih_, also called _Chang-k'ang_ and _Hu-tou_, was born in        Wu-hsi in the province of Kiang-su. He lived at the end of the        fourth and beginning of the fifth century. His style, resembling        that of the Han period, informs us as to the character of painting        from the second to the fifth century. It is such as to indicate a        long antecedent period of cultivation and development.      _Hsieh Ho_ (479-502), painter of the figure. He wrote a small book        setting forth the Six Canons or Requirements of painting. This work        informs us regarding the philosophy of art in China of the fifth        century.      II. THE INTERVENTION OF BUDDHISM    It is difficult to set an exact date for the first contact of Buddhist  with Chinese art. It may be assumed that the influence of Buddhist art  began to be felt noticeably in China in the fifth century. In the seventh  and eighth centuries it was so widespread as to be definitely established.      III. THE T'ANG DYNASTY    A.D. 618-905      _Wu Tao-tz[)u]_, also called _Wu Tao-yuean_. Born in Honan toward the        end of the eighth century. His influence was felt in Japanese art        as well as in that of China. He painted landscape, figures and        Buddhist subjects.      _Li Ss[)u]-hsuen_ (651-715 or 720) is considered as the founder of the        Northern School. He appears to have felt the influence which        Buddhist art brought in its train.      _Li Chao-tao_, son of Li Ss[)u]-hsuen, lived at the end of the seventh        and beginning of the eighth centuries. He is said to have varied        from his father's style and even surpassed it.      _Wang Wei_, also called _Wang Mo-k'i_ (699-759), poet, painter and        critic. The great reformer of Chinese landscape painting.        Considered as the founder of the Southern School and the originator        of monochrome painting in Chinese ink.      _Han Kan_, renowned in the period _t'ien-pao_ (742-759). According to        tradition he was a pupil of Wang Wei. His school possessed in the        highest degree knowledge of the form, characteristics and movements        of the horse.      IV. THE SUNG DYNASTY    A.D. 960-1260      _Tung Yuean._ Tenth century. Landscape painter. He worked in both the        Northern and Southern styles.      _Chue Jan_, Buddhist monk. Tenth century. He was at first influenced by        the work of Tung Yuean, but later created an individual style.      _Ma Yuean._ End of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century.        Member of the Academy of Painting. He was the author of a strong        and vigorous style which characterized the school founded by him.      _Hsia Kuei_ served in the college at Han-Lin in the reign of the        Emperor Ning Tsung (1195-1224). He was considered a master of        chiaroscuro and atmospheric perspective.      _Ma Lin_, son of Ma Yuean. Thirteenth century. His work shows that he        painted even more in the tradition of the Southern School than his        father and uncle.      _Li Lung-mien_ or _Li Kung-lin_. Born at Chou in Ngan-huei. He held        public offices, which he resigned in 1100 to retire to the mountain        of Lung-mien, where he died in 1106. Noted for his calligraphy as        well as for his painting. At one time in his life, under religious        influences, he painted a great number of Buddhist figures.      _Mi Fei_ or _Mi Yuean-chang_ or _Mi Nan-kung_ (1051-1107).        Calligraphist, painter and critic. He used strong inking in a style        in which the simplification of monochrome is carried to the        extreme. He had a son, _Mi Yu-Jen_, who painted in his father's        style and lived to an advanced age.      _Hui Tsung_, emperor, poet, painter and calligraphist. Born in 1082,        ascended the throne in 1100, lost his throne in 1125 and died in        captivity in 1135. In the first year of his reign he founded the        Academy of Calligraphy and Painting. He made a large collection of        valuable paintings and rare objects of art which was scattered at        the plundering of his capital by the Tartars in 1225.      V. YUeAN DYNASTY    A.D. 1260-1368      _Chao Meng-fu_, also called _Ts[)u]-ang_. Born in 1254. Man of        letters, painter and calligraphist. He was a great landscape        painter and in the first rank as a painter of horses.      _Ch'ien Hsuean_, also called _Ch'ien Shun-chue_, lived at the end of the        thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. He painted        figures, landscape, flowers and birds. He employed the style and        methods of the Sung dynasty.      _Yen Hui_ lived in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. His        paintings were numerous and indicate a master of the first order.        He painted many Buddhist and Taoist subjects.      _Huang Kung-wang._ Fourteenth century. At first influenced by the style        of Tung Yuean and Chue Jan, he later acquired an individual style and        was one of the great founders of schools in the Yuean period.      _Ni Tsan_, also called Yuen-lin (1301-1374). Man of letters,        calligraphist, collector of books and paintings. He is considered        to be one of the greatest painters of his time.      VI. THE MING DYNASTY    A.D. 1368-1644      _Chou Chih-mien_ lived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His        subjects were principally birds and flowers.      _Shen Chou_, also called _Shen Ki-nan_ or _Shen K'i_ (1427-1507).        Landscape painter. His composition is at times overladen, as is        often seen in Ming art.      _Lu Fu_ lived in the fifteenth century. He made a special study of the        plum tree in monochrome. He is comparable to the great Sung        masters.      _Wang Yuean-chang._ Died in 1407 at the age of 73. He painted the bamboo        and plum tree in monochrome. He carried on the Sung tradition,        with which he was directly connected, and was the founder of a        school.      _Wen Cheng-ming_ (1480-1559), painter, poet and calligraphist. He is        often compared with Chao Meng-fu.      _Ju-sue._ Known only under this appellation. He lived in the fifteenth        century and went to Japan, where his influence was marked.        (Japanese _Josetsu_.)      VII. THE CH'ING DYNASTY    1644-1912      _Yuen Chou-p'ing_, appellation _Nan-t'ien_, true name _Yuen Ko_        (1633-1690). He studied at first under the influence of Wang        Shu-ming and Siu Hi. He painted figures, flowers and landscape.      _Shen Nan-p'ing_ lived in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He        was called to Japan in 1720 and founded there the school of        Ming-Ch'ing or the modern Chinese school.      _Huang Yin-piau_ or _Huang-shen_. At the height of his career between        1727 and 1746. He painted landscape and, toward the end of his        life, legendary figures of Buddhism and Taoism with a technique        that was skillful but often precise and somewhat weak."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/223"],[0,"The Wisdom of Father Brown (#13)"],[1,"his pale rival, and made a stride towards him.    In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown stepped  out into the top of the passage, looked down it, and at once walked  briskly towards what he saw.    At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him,  Cutler calling out: \"What are you doing? Who are you?\"    \"My name is Brown,\" said the priest sadly, as he bent over something  and straightened himself again. \"Miss Rome sent for me, and I came as  quickly as I could. I have come too late.\"    The three men looked down, and in one of them at least the life died in  that late light of afternoon. It ran along the passage like a path of  gold, and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay lustrous in her robes of  green and gold, with her dead face turned upwards. Her dress was torn  away as in a struggle, leaving the right shoulder bare, but the wound  from which the blood was welling was on the other side. The brass dagger  lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away.    There was a blank stillness for a measurable time, so that they could  hear far off a flower-girl's laugh outside Charing Cross, and someone  whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets off the Strand.  Then the Captain, with a movement so sudden that it might have been  passion or play-acting, took Sir Wilson Seymour by the throat.    Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear. \"You need  not kill me,\" he said in a voice quite cold; \"I shall do that on my own  account.\"    The Captain's hand hesitated and dropped; and the other added with the  same icy candour: \"If I find I haven't the nerve to do it with that  dagger I can do it in a month with drink.\"    \"Drink isn't good enough for me,\" replied Cutler, \"but I'll have blood  for this before I die. Not yours--but I think I know whose.\"    And before the others could appreciate his intention he snatched up the  dagger, sprang at the other door at the lower end of the passage, burst  it open, bolt and all, and confronted Bruno in his dressing-room. As he  did so, old Parkinson tottered in his wavering way out of the door  and caught sight of the corpse lying in the passage. He moved shakily  towards it; looked at it weakly with a working face; then moved shakily  back into the dressing-room again, and sat down suddenly on one of  the richly cushioned chairs. Father Brown instantly ran across to him,  taking no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor, though the room  already rang with their blows and they began to struggle for the dagger.  Seymour, who retained some practical sense, was whistling for the police  at the end of the passage.    When the police arrived it was to tear the two men from an almost  ape-like grapple; and, after a few formal inquiries, to arrest Isidore  Bruno upon a charge of murder, brought against him by his furious  opponent. The idea that the great national hero of the hour had arrested  a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight with the police,  who are not without elements of the journalist. They treated Cutler with  a certain solemn attention, and pointed out that he had got a slight  slash on the hand. Even as Cutler bore him back across tilted chair and  table, Bruno had twisted the dagger out of his grasp and disabled him  just below the wrist. The injury was really slight, but till he was  removed from the room the half-savage prisoner stared at the running  blood with a steady smile.    \"Looks a cannibal sort of chap, don't he?\" said the constable  confidentially to Cutler.    Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after: \"We must attend  to the...the death...\" and his voice escaped from articulation.    \"The two deaths,\" came in the voice of the priest from the farther side  of the room. \"This poor fellow was gone when I got across to him.\" And  he stood looking down at old Parkinson, who sat in a black huddle on the  gorgeous chair. He also had paid his tribute, not without eloquence, to  the woman who had died.    The silence was first broken by Cutler, who seemed not untouched by a  rough tenderness. \"I wish I was him,\" he said huskily. \"I remember he  used to watch her wherever she walked more than--anybody. She was his  air, and he's dried up. He's just dead.\"    \"We are all dead,\" said Seymour in a strange voice, looking down the  road.    They took leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road, with some  random apologies for any rudeness they might have shown. Both their  faces were tragic, but also cryptic.    The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit-warren of wild  thoughts that jumped too quickly for him to catch them. Like the white  tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that he was certain of  their grief, but not so certain of their innocence.    \"We had better all be going,\" said Seymour heavily; \"we have done all we  can to help.\"    \"Will you understand my motives,\" asked Father Brown quietly, \"if I say  you have done all you can to hurt?\"    They both started as if guiltily, and Cutler said sharply: \"To hurt  whom?\"    \"To hurt yourselves,\" answered the priest. \"I would not add to your  troubles if it weren't common justice to warn you. You've done nearly  everything you could do to hang yourselves, if this actor should be  acquitted. They'll be sure to subpoena me; I shall be bound to say that  after the cry was heard each of you rushed into the room in a wild state  and began quarrelling about a dagger. As far as my words on oath can go,  you might either of you have done it. You hurt yourselves with that; and  then Captain Cutler must have hurt himself with the dagger.\"    \"Hurt myself!\" exclaimed the Captain, with contempt. \"A silly little  scratch.\"    \"Which drew blood,\" replied the priest, nodding. \"We know there's blood  on the brass now. And so we shall never know whether there was blood on  it before.\"    There was a silence; and then Seymour said, with an emphasis quite alien  to his daily accent: \"But I saw a man in the passage.\"    \"I know you did,\" answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood, \"so did  Captain Cutler. That's what seems so improbable.\"    Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer, Father  Brown had politely excused himself and gone stumping up the road with  his stumpy old umbrella.    As modern newspapers are conducted, the most honest and most important  news is the police news. If it be true that in the twentieth century  more space is given to murder than to politics, it is for the excellent  reason that murder is a more serious subject. But even this would hardly  explain the enormous omnipresence and widely distributed detail of \"The  Bruno Case,\" or \"The Passage Mystery,\" in the Press of London and the  provinces. So vast was the excitement that for some weeks the  Press really told the truth; and the reports of examination and  cross-examination, if interminable, even if intolerable are at least  reliable. The true reason, of course, was the coincidence of persons.  The victim was a popular actress; the accused was a popular actor; and  the accused had been caught red-handed, as it were, by the most popular  soldier of the patriotic season. In those extraordinary circumstances  the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy; and the rest of this  somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of  Bruno's trial.    The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monkhouse, one of those  who are jeered at as humorous judges, but who are generally much more  serious than the serious judges, for their levity comes from a living  impatience of professional solemnity; while the serious judge is really  filled with frivolity, because he is filled with vanity. All the chief  actors being of a worldly importance, the barristers were well balanced;  the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray, a heavy, but  weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem English and  trustworthy, and how to be rhetorical with reluctance. The prisoner was  defended by Mr Patrick Butler, K.C., who was mistaken for a mere flaneur  by those who misunderstood the Irish character--and those who had not  been examined by him. The medical evidence involved no contradictions,  the doctor, whom Seymour had summoned on the spot, agreeing with the  eminent surgeon who had later examined the body. Aurora Rome had been  stabbed with some sharp instrument such as a knife or dagger; some  instrument, at least, of which the blade was short. The wound was just  over the heart, and she had died instantly. When the doctor first saw  her she could hardly have been dead for twenty minutes. Therefore when  Father Brown found her she could hardly have been dead for three.    Some official detective evidence followed, chiefly concerned with the  presence or absence of any proof of a struggle; the only suggestion of  this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder, and this did not seem  to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow.  When these details had been supplied, though not explained, the first of  the important witnesses was called.    Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else that he did  at all--not only well, but perfectly. Though himself much more of  a public man than the judge, he conveyed exactly the fine shade of  self-effacement before the King's justice; and though everyone looked at  him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury,  they could have said nothing of his part in it but that it was that of a  private gentleman, with an accent on the noun. He was also refreshingly  lucid, as he was on the committees. He had been calling on Miss Rome at  the theatre; he had met Captain Cutler there; they had been joined for  a short time by the accused, who had then returned to his own  dressing-room; they had then been joined by a Roman Catholic priest, who  asked for the deceased lady and said his name was Brown.
