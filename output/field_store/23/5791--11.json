In his not unreasonable anxiety for the tenure of his  estate, he went further still; he had the Jesuits removed from the  charge of the missions, to be replaced by seculars, and only receded  from this severe measure when the Jesuit order acceded to his terms. The  pious and venerable Father White records in his journal that \"occasion  of suffering has not been wanting from those from whom rather it was  proper to expect aid and protection, who, too intent upon their own  affairs, have not feared to violate the immunities of the church.\"[59:1]  But the zeal of the Calverts for religious liberty and equality was  manifested not only by curbing the Jesuits, but by encouraging their  most strenuous opponents. It was in the year 1643, when the strength of  Puritanism both in England and in New England was proved, that the  Calverts made overtures, although in vain, to secure an immigration from  Massachusetts. A few years later the opportunity occurred of  strengthening their own colony with an accession of Puritans, and at the  same time of weakening Virginia. The sturdy and prosperous Puritan  colony on the Nansemond River were driven by the churlish behavior of  Governor Berkeley to seek a more congenial residence, and were induced  to settle on the Severn at a place which they called Providence, but  which was destined, under the name of Annapolis, to become the capital  of the future State. It was manifestly not merely a coincidence that  Lord Baltimore appointed a Protestant governor, William Stone, and  commended to the Maryland Assembly, in 1649, the enacting of \"an Act  concerning Religion,\" drawn upon the lines of the Ordinance of  Toleration adopted by the Puritan House of Commons at the height of its  authority, in 1647.[59:2] How potent was the influence of this  transplanted Nansemond church is largely shown in the eventful civil  history of the colony. When, in 1655, the lord proprietor's governor was  so imprudent as to set an armed force in the field, under the colors of  Lord Baltimore, in opposition to the parliamentary commissioners, it  was the planters of the Severn who marched under the flag of the  commonwealth of England, and put them to rout, and executed some of  their leaders for treason. When at last articles of agreement were  signed between the commissioners and Lord Baltimore, one of the  conditions exacted from his lordship was a pledge that he would never  consent to the repeal of the Act of Toleration adopted in 1649 under the  influence of the Puritan colony and its pastor, Thomas Harrison.    In the turbulence of the colony during and after the civil wars of  England, there becomes more and more manifest a growing spirit of  fanaticism, especially in the form of antipopery crusading. While  Jacobite intrigues or wars with France were in progress it was easy for  demagogues to cast upon the Catholics the suspicion of disloyalty and of  complicity with the public enemy. The numerical unimportance of the  Catholics of Maryland was insufficient to guard them from such  suspicions; for it had soon become obvious that the colony of the  Catholic lord was to be anything but a Catholic colony. The Jesuit  mission had languished; the progress of settlement, and what there had  been of religious life and teaching, had brought no strength to the  Catholic cause. In 1676 a Church of England minister, John Yeo, writes  to the Archbishop of Canterbury of the craving lack of ministers,  excepting among the Catholics and the Quakers, \"not doubting but his  Grace may so prevail with Lord Baltimore that a maintenance for a  Protestant ministry may be established.\" The Bishop of London, echoing  this complaint, speaks of the \"total want of ministers and divine  worship, except among those of the Romish belief, who, 'tis conjectured,  does not amount to one of a hundred of the people.\" To which his  lordship replies that all sects are tolerated and protected, but that  it would be impossible to induce the Assembly to consent to a law that  shall oblige any sect to maintain other ministers than its own. The  bishop's figures were doubtless at fault; but Lord Baltimore himself  writes that the nonconformists outnumber the Catholics and those of the  Church of England together about three to one, and that the churchmen  are much more numerous than the Catholics.    After the Revolution of 1688 it is not strange that a like movement was  set on foot in Maryland. The \"beneficent despotism\" of the Calverts,  notwithstanding every concession on their part, was ended for the time  by the efforts of an \"Association for the Defense of the Protestant  Religion,\" and Maryland became a royal colony. Under the new regime it  was easier to inflict annoyances and disabilities on the petty minority  of the Roman Catholics than to confer the privileges of an established  church on the hardly more considerable minority of Episcopalians. The  Church of England became in name the official church of the colony, but  two parties so remotely unlike as the Catholics and the Quakers combined  successfully to defeat more serious encroachments on religious liberty.  The attempt to maintain the church of a small minority by taxes extorted  by a foreign government from the whole people had the same effect in  Maryland as in Ireland: it tended to make both church and government  odious. The efforts of Dr. Thomas Bray, commissary of the Bishop of  London, a man of true apostolic fervor, accomplished little in  withstanding the downward tendency of the provincial establishment. The  demoralized and undisciplined clergy resisted the attempt of the  provincial government to abate the scandal of their lives, and the  people resisted the attempt to introduce a bishop. The body thus set  before the people as the official representative of the religion of  Christ \"was perhaps as contemptible an ecclesiastical organization as  history can show,\" having \"all the vices of the Virginian church,  without one of its safeguards or redeeming qualities.\"[62:1] The most  hopeful sign in the morning sky of the eighteenth century was to be  found in the growth of the Society of Friends and the swelling of the  current of the Scotch-Irish immigration. And yet we shall have proof  that the life-work of Commissary Bray, although he went back discouraged  from his labors in Maryland and although this colony took little direct  benefit from his efforts in England, was destined to have great results  in the advancement of the kingdom of Christ in America; for he was the  founder of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign  Parts.    The Carolinas, North and South, had been the scene of the earliest  attempts at Protestant colonization in America. The Huguenot enterprise  at Beaufort, on Port Royal harbor, was planted in 1562 under the  auspices of Coligny, and came to a speedy and unhappy end. The costly  and disastrous experiment of Sir Walter Raleigh was begun in 1584 on  Roanoke Island, and lasted not many months. But the actual occupation of  the region was late and slow. When, after the Restoration, Charles II.  took up the idea of paying his political debts with free and easy  cessions of American lands, Clarendon, Albemarle, and Shaftesbury were  among the first and luckiest in the scramble. When the representatives  of themselves and their partners arrived in Carolina in 1670, bringing  with them that pompous and preposterous anachronism, the \"Fundamental  Constitutions,\" contrived by the combined wisdom of Shaftesbury and John  Locke to impose a feudal government upon an immense domain of  wilderness, they found the ground already occupied with a scanty and  curiously mixed population, which had taken on a simple form of polity  and was growing into a state. The region adjoining Virginia was peopled  by Puritans from the Nansemond country, vexed with the paltry  persecutions of Governor Berkeley, and later by fugitives from the  bloody revenge which he delighted to inflict on those who had been  involved in the righteous rebellion led by Nathaniel Bacon. These had  been joined by insolvent debtors not a few. Adventurers from New England  settled on the Cape Fear River for a lumber trade, and kept the various  plantations in communication with the rest of the world by their  coasting craft plying to Boston. Dissatisfied companies from Barbadoes  seeking a less torrid climate next arrived. Thus the region was settled  in the first instance at second hand from older colonies. To these came  settlers direct from England, such emigrants as the proprietors could  persuade to the undertaking, and such as were impelled by the evil state  of England in the last days of the Stuarts, or drawn by the promise of  religious liberty.    South Carolina, on the other hand, was settled direct from Europe, first  by cargoes of emigrants shipped on speculation by the great real-estate  \"operators\" who had at heart not only the creation of a gorgeous  aristocracy in the West, but also the realization of fat dividends on  their heavy ventures. Members of the dominant politico-religious party  in England were attracted to a country in which they were still to be  regarded before the law as of the \"only true and orthodox\" church; and  religious dissenters gladly accepted the offer of toleration and  freedom, even without the assurance of equality. One of the most notable  contributions to the new colony was a company of dissenters from  Somersetshire, led by Joseph Blake, brother to Cromwell's illustrious  admiral. Among these were some of the earliest American Baptists; and  there is clear evidence of connection between their arrival and the  coming, in 1684, of a Baptist church from the Massachusetts Colony,  under the pastorate of William Screven.

Suspected of giving bad advice to the king, he  was compelled to resign, but was given the inferior bishopric of Ely,  where he lived to extreme old age, dying in 1425.    #Walter de Skirlaw# (1388-1405), translated from Bath and Wells, was  a munificent prelate. He built bridges at Shincliffe, Bishop Auckland,  and Yarm; a refuge tower, a beautiful chapter-house (now in ruins) at  Howden; and was a large contributor to the expense of building the  central tower of York Cathedral. His work in the building of the  cloisters of Durham has already been referred to.    #Thomas Langley# (1406-1437) succeeded. He was Chancellor of England,  Dean of York, and in 1411 was made a cardinal. He occupied the see  during part of the reign of Henry IV., the whole of that of Henry V.,  and fifteen years of that of Henry VI. He founded two schools on the  Palace Green at Durham, and in his will left collections of books to  many colleges.    #Robert Neville# (1437-1457), son of the Earl of Westmoreland and his  wife Joan, who was a daughter of John of Gaunt. He was therefore uncle  of the Earl of Warwick, the \"king-maker\" of Richard III. and of Edward  IV. He had a peaceful episcopate of nineteen years, and was buried in  the cathedral, in the south aisle near his ancestors.    #Laurance Booth# (1457-1476), Canon of York and Lichfield, Archdeacon  of Richmond, and Dean of S. Paul's, was the next bishop. He was a  supporter of the House of Lancaster. He was translated to the  archbishopric of York in 1476, the first of the bishops of Durham who  was raised to that dignity.    #William Dudley# (1476-1483), Dean of Windsor, succeeded him.    #John Sherwood# (1483-1494), who was appointed next, was a learned  man, and made a large collection of Greek manuscripts. He died in Rome  in 1494.    #Richard Fox# (1494-1501) was translated from Bath and Wells after  the see had remained vacant for eleven months. Nothing of particular  moment occurred during his episcopate. He was an early patron and helper  of Wolsey, and lived to regret having assisted him. He made alterations  in the castle at Durham. He was translated to the see of Winchester in  1501, and died in 1528.    #William Sinews# or #Sever# (1502-1505), translated from Carlisle.  He is said to have been the son of a sieve-maker at Shincliffe, near  Durham.    #Christopher Bainbridge# (1507-1508), Dean of York, was next elected,  and after an episcopate of one year was translated to York. In 1511 he  was sent to Rome as ambassador by Henry VIII., and while there was  created cardinal. He died in Rome, poisoned by a servant whom he had  struck in anger.    #Thomas Ruthall# (1509-1522), Dean of Salisbury, was the next bishop.  He was immensely wealthy, and his love of money brought him into  disgrace. King Henry commanded him to draw up an account of the lands  and revenues of the Crown. The bishop, in error, sent to the king the  wrong book, in which was set forth an account of his own possessions.  The king, though tampered with by Wolsey, made no use of the knowledge  thus obtained. But the affair rankled in the mind of the bishop, and is  said to have hastened his death.    #Thomas Wolsey# (1522-1528) was appointed to succeed him. The famous  cardinal held the see for six years, as well as that of York. During the  whole of his episcopate he never visited Durham, and in 1528 he resigned  it for the see of Winchester.    #Cuthbert Tunstall# (1530-1559) was translated from London by a Papal  Bull, the last used for this purpose. Tunstall was a remarkable man, and  he occupied the see during an important period of Church history, the  Reformation, all the stages of which he saw. During his episcopacy, the  great privileges of the bishops of Durham as Princes Palatine were very  much curtailed. In 1526, while Tunstall was Bishop of London, the  English translation of the New Testament by Tyndall appeared, causing  great alarm among the clergy. The part played by Tunstall in relation to  this is well known. He opposed the supremacy of King Henry as head of  the Church, but eventually gave up the struggle and preached in its  favour. The monastery of Durham was suppressed in 1540, and a dean and  twelve canons appointed. Soon after the accession of Edward VI., Bishop  Tunstall was committed to the Tower and deprived of his see, on a charge  of having encouraged rebellion in the north. On the accession of Mary to  the throne he was released and restored, but there would seem to be no  grounds for supposing that he took any part in the cruelties practised  during her reign. When Elizabeth became queen, Tunstall refused to take  the oath, and was again deprived of his see, and, being now an old man,  was committed to the custody of his friend Archbishop Parker  (Canterbury), with whom he lived till his death in 1559. He was a  scholarly prelate, of a kindly nature, and was held in universal esteem.    #James Pilkington# (1560-1575) left the buildings of the see in a  ruinous condition.    #Richard Barnes# (1575-1587), translated from Carlisle. He is said to  have been removed to Durham in order to spy upon the correspondence and  messengers of the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots.    #Matthew Hutton# (1589-1594), Dean of York, was the next bishop. A  man of great learning, and considered one of the best preachers of his  day. He was translated to York in 1594.    #Tobias Matthew# (1595-1606), Dean of Durham, was his successor. He  was also a great preacher, and was celebrated for his wit. He was  translated to York.    #William James# (1606-1617), Dean of Durham, was next elected.    #Richard Neile# (1617-1627) was translated from Lincoln. He was  remarkable as being the only bishop who held six sees successively--viz.  1608, Rochester; 1610, Lichfield; 1613, Lincoln; 1617, Durham; 1627,  Winchester; and 1631, Archbishop of York. He did much to help forward  men of learning and ability by giving them preferment in his see, and  reserving apartments for their use in Durham House, London, which became  known as Durham College. He spent large sums of money on repairs to the  buildings at Durham.    #George Monteigne# (1628), Bishop of London, only held the see of  Durham for three months, when he was translated to York.    #John Howson# (1628-1631), Bishop of Oxford, held the see for two  years, and died in 1631.    #Thomas Morton# (1632-1659), translated from Lichfield. The North of  England was much disturbed in 1640 by the invasion of the Scots, and  Bishop Morton fled--first to Stockton, afterwards to York--and never  returned to his diocese. The successful Scots levied heavy taxes on the  district for the maintenance of their troops, as much as L850 a day  being demanded. In 1646, Episcopacy was abolished, and the estates of  the bishops ordered to be sold. Thus we find at Durham the castle sold  to the Mayor of London for L1267 and Durham, Borough, and Framwellgate  disposed of to the Corporation for L200. The bishop lived a life of  suffering in London, cared for by his friends, till his death in 1659,  at the age of ninety-four. During his episcopate, in 1656, Oliver  Cromwell arranged for the founding of a college in Durham, but his death  prevented him carrying out his scheme. His son, however, did so, and it  flourished until the Restoration, which, by giving back property to its  rightful owners, put an end to its existence.    #John Cosin# (1660-1671), Canon of Durham, was the first bishop after  the Restoration. He was a most munificent prelate, leaving many  charitable bequests. He spent large sums in the restoration of the  cathedral and castle and the palace at Bishop Auckland. He built a  hospital for eight poor people, and erected a library on the palace  green.    #Nathaniel Crewe# (1642-1722), translated from Oxford. He was a  strong supporter of King James II., but afterwards took the oath of  allegiance to William and Mary. He was noted for his charity and  munificence, and left large sums to the poor, and in scholarships  tenable by natives of Durham.    #William Talbot# (1722-1730), translated from Salisbury.    #Edward Chandler# (1730-1750), Bishop of Lichfield, was next elected.  He gave L2000 to be laid out for the benefit of the widows of clergymen  of his diocese.    #Joseph Butler# (1750-1752) was translated from Bristol. He is best  known as the author of \"The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed.\"    #Richard Trevor# (1752-1771), Bishop of S. David's, a learned, pious,  and unostentatious man. He left L200 in his will to the poor of Durham  and Auckland.    #John Egerton# (1771-1787), Bishop of Lichfield, was next elected. He  married the daughter of Henry, Duke of Kent, and his eldest son  afterwards became Earl of Bridgewater.    #Thomas Thurlow# (1787-1791) was translated to Durham from Lincoln.  He was brother of the Lord Chancellor.    #Shute Barrington# (1791-1826) was the next bishop, having previously  held the sees of Llandaff and Salisbury. A most beneficent prelate; his  charities, especially those for the founding of schools and augmentation  of poor livings, were magnificent. During his episcopacy, external  repairs to the cathedral having become absolutely necessary, James  Wyatt, who had already done such mischief at Salisbury, was given charge  of the work. Then it was that the paring process, spoken of previously,  was completed, the chapter-house destroyed, and the Galilee Chapel only  saved from destruction by the intervention of Dean Cornwallis. Wyatt's  other wild schemes, to extend the choir eastwards, to the utter ruin of  the Nine Altar Chapel, to remove the beautiful Neville screen, and  surmount the central tower of the church by a spire, were happily  checked in time, or there is no saying to what extent the building would  have been"]]]
