CHAPTER XIV    TERMS RELATING TO FORMS AND STYLES      132. A _form_ in music is a specific arrangement of the various parts of  a composition resulting in a structure so characteristic that it is  easily recognized by the ear. Thus _e.g._, although every fugue is  different from all other fugues in actual material, yet the arrangement  of the various parts is so characteristic that no one who knows the  _fugue form_ has any doubt as to what kind of a composition he is  hearing whenever a fugue is played. The word _form_ is therefore seen to  be somewhat synonymous with the word _plan_ as used in architecture; it  is the structure or design underlying music. Examples of form are the  canon, the fugue, the sonata, etc.         Speaking broadly we may say that _form_ in any art consists in       the placing together of certain parts in such relations of       proportion and symmetry as to make a unified whole. In music       this implies unity of tonality and of general rhythmic effect,       as well as unity in the grouping of the various parts of the       work (phrases, periods, movements) so as to weld them into one       whole, giving the impression of completeness to the hearer.    133. The primal _basis of form_ is the repetition of some characteristic  effect, and the problem of the composer is to bring about these  repetitions in such a way that the ear will recognize them as being the  same material and will nevertheless not grow weary of them. This is  accomplished by varying the material (cf. thematic development), by  introducing contrasting material, and by choice of key.    134. The student should note at the outset of this topic the _difference  in meaning between_ the terms _form_ and _style_: A _form_ is a plan  for building a certain definite kind of composition, but a _style_ is  merely a manner of writing. Thus _e.g._, the _fugue_ is a  _form_--_i.e._, it is a plan, which although capable of variation in  details, is yet carried out fairly definitely in every case; but  _counterpoint_ is merely a _style_ or manner of writing (just as Gothic  architecture is a style of building), which may be cast into any one of  several _forms_.    135. The material found in the following sections is an attempt to  explain in simple language certain terms relating to _forms_ and  _styles_ which are in common use; in many cases the definition is too  meagre to give anything but a very general idea, but it is hoped that  the student will at least be set to thinking and that he will eventually  be led to a more detailed and scholarly study of the subject. (The  article \"Form\" and the separate articles under each term here defined,  as found in Grove's Dictionary, are especially recommended. For examples  of the various forms described, see also Mason and Surette--\"The  Appreciation of Music,\" Supplementary Volume.)    136. In a very general way there may be said to be _two styles of  musical composition_, the monophonic (or homophonic)--the  one-voiced--and the polyphonic--the many voiced. The polyphonic[32]  style antedates the monophonic historically.    [Footnote 32: Polyphonic music flourished from 1000 A.D. to about 1750  A.D., the culmination of the polyphonic period being reached in the  music of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,  and the later writers have used the monophonic style more than the  polyphonic, although a combination of the two is often found, as _e.g._,  in the later works of Beethoven.]    137. In _monophonic music_ there is one voice which has a pronounced  melody, the other voices (if present) supporting this melody as a  harmonic (and often rhythmic) background. An example of this is the  ordinary hymn-tune with its melody in the highest part, and with three  other voices forming a \"four-part harmony.\" The sonata, symphony, opera,  modern piano piece, etc., are also largely _monophonic_, though  polyphonic passages by way of contrast are often to be found.    138. In _polyphonic music_ each voice is to a certain extent melodically  interesting, and the \"harmony\" is the result of combining several  melodies in such a way as to give a pleasing effect, instead of treating  a melody by adding chords as an accompaniment or support. Counterpoint,  canon, round, fugue, etc., are all _polyphonic_ in style. The word  _contrapuntal_ is often used synonymously with _polyphonic_.         (Sections 139 to 143 relate especially to terms describing       polyphonic music.)    139. _Counterpoint_ is the art of adding one or more parts or melodies  to a given melody, the latter being known as the \"cantus firmus,\" or  subject. It may therefore be broadly defined as \"the art of combining  melodies.\"         The word _counterpoint_ comes from the three words \"_punctus       contra punctum_,\" meaning \"point against point.\" The word       point as here used refers to the _punctus_--one of the neumae       of the mediaeval system, these neumae being the immediate       predecessors of modern notes.         Both vocal and instrumental music have been written in       contrapuntal style. The familiar two- and three-part       \"inventions\" by Bach are excellent examples of instrumental       counterpoint, while such choruses as those in \"The Messiah\" by       Handel illustrate the highest type of vocal counterpoint.    140. _Imitation_ is the repetition by one part, of a subject or theme  previously introduced by another part. If the imitation is exact, the  term _strict imitation_ is applied, but if only approximate, then the  term _free imitation_ is used in referring to it. The repetition need  not have the exact pitches of the subject in order to be _strict_; on  the contrary the imitation is usually at the interval of an octave, or a  fifth, or a second, etc. Fig. 57 shows an example of strict imitation in  which the _third_ part comes in an octave _lower_ than the first part.    141. A _canon_ is a contrapuntal composition in the style of strict  imitation, one part repeating exactly (but at any interval) what another  part has played or sung. The term \"canonic style\" is sometimes applied  to music in which the imitation is not exact. An example of three-part  canon is given in Fig. 57.    [Illustration: CANON IN THREE VOICES, IN THE UNISON AND OCTAVE    Fig. 57. MOZART]         The word _canon_ means _law_, and was applied to this       particular form of composition because the rules relating to       its composition were invariable. It is because of this       non-flexibility that the _canon_ is so little used as a form       at the present time: the modern composer demands a plan of       writing that is capable of being varied to such an extent as       to give him room for the exercise of his own particular       individuality of conception, and this the _canon_ does not do.       For this same reason too the fugue and the sonata have       successively gone out of fashion and from Schumann down to the       present time composers have as it were created their own       forms, the difficulty in listening arising from the fact that       no one but the composer himself could recognize the form _as_       a form because it had not been adopted to a great enough       extent by other composers to make it in any sense universal.       The result is that in much present-day music it is very       difficult for the hearer to discover any trace of familiar       design, and the impression made by such music is in       consequence much less definite than that made by music of the       classic school. It is probable that a reaction from this state       of affairs will come in the near future, for in any art it is       necessary that there should be at least enough semblance of       structure to make the art work capable of standing as a       universal thing rather than as the mere temporary expression       of some particular composer or of some period of composition.    142. The common _school round_ is an example of canon, each voice  repeating exactly what the first voice has sung, while this first voice  is going on with its melody. The _round_ is therefore defined as a  variety of canon in which the imitation is always in unison with the  subject.    143. The _fugue_ (Latin, _fuga_ = flight) is a form of contrapuntal  composition in which the imitation is always in the dominant key,  _i.e._, a fifth above or a fourth below. The imitation (called \"the  answer\") may be an exact repetition of the subject (sometimes called  \"the question\"), but is usually not so.         The _fugue_ differs from the canon also in that the subject is       given in complete form before the answer begins, while in the       canon the imitation begins while the subject is still going       on. The _fugue_ is not nearly so strict in form as the canon       and gives the composer much greater opportunity for expressing       musical ideas. A canon may be perfect in _form_ and yet be       very poor music; this same statement might of course be made       about any form, but is especially true in the stricter ones.          CHAPTER XV    TERMS RELATING TO FORMS AND STYLES (_Continued_)           (Sections 144 to 160 relate particularly to terms used in       descriptions of _monophonic_ music[33].)    [Footnote 33: There is a very pronounced disagreement among theorists as  to what terms are to be used in referring to certain forms and parts of  forms and it seems impossible to make a compromise that will satisfy  even a reasonable number. In order to make the material in this chapter  consistent with itself therefore it has been thought best by the author  to follow the terminology of some single recognized work on form, and  the general plan of monophonic form here given is therefore "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#13)"],[1,"phrenologists place the animal  organs. To speak as a phrenologist, the cranium common to the Vril-ya  has the organs of weight, number, tune, form, order, causality, very  largely developed; that of construction much more pronounced than  that of ideality. Those which are called the moral organs, such as  conscientiousness and benevolence, are amazingly full; amativeness  and combativeness are both small; adhesiveness large; the organ of  destructiveness (i.e., of determined clearance of intervening  obstacles) immense, but less than that of benevolence; and their  philoprogenitiveness takes rather the character of compassion and  tenderness to things that need aid or protection than of the animal love  of offspring. I never met with one person deformed or misshapen. The  beauty of their countenances is not only in symmetry of feature, but in  a smoothness of surface, which continues without line or wrinkle to the  extreme of old age, and a serene sweetness of expression, combined with  that majesty which seems to come from consciousness of power and the  freedom of all terror, physical or moral. It is that very sweetness,  combined with that majesty, which inspired in a beholder like myself,  accustomed to strive with the passions of mankind, a sentiment of  humiliation, of awe, of dread. It is such an expression as a painter  might give to a demi-god, a genius, an angel. The males of the Vril-ya  are entirely beardless; the Gy-ei sometimes, in old age, develop a small  moustache.    I was surprised to find that the colour of their skin was not uniformly  that which I had remarked in those individuals whom I had first  encountered,--some being much fairer, and even with blue eyes, and hair  of a deep golden auburn, though still of complexions warmer or richer in  tone than persons in the north of Europe.    I was told that this admixture of colouring arose from intermarriage  with other and more distant tribes of the Vril-ya, who, whether by the  accident of climate or early distinction of race, were of fairer hues  than the tribes of which this community formed one. It was considered  that the dark-red skin showed the most ancient family of Ana; but they  attached no sentiment of pride to that antiquity, and, on the contrary,  believed their present excellence of breed came from frequent crossing  with other families differing, yet akin; and they encourage such  intermarriages, always provided that it be with the Vril-ya nations.  Nations which, not conforming their manners and institutions to those  of the Vril-ya, nor indeed held capable of acquiring the powers over  the vril agencies which it had taken them generations to attain and  transmit, were regarded with more disdain than the citizens of New York  regard the negroes.    I learned from Zee, who had more lore in all matters than any male with  whom I was brought into familiar converse, that the superiority of  the Vril-ya was supposed to have originated in the intensity of their  earlier struggles against obstacles in nature amidst the localities  in which they had first settled. \"Wherever,\" said Zee, moralising,  \"wherever goes on that early process in the history of civilisation, by  which life is made a struggle, in which the individual has to put forth  all his powers to compete with his fellow, we invariably find this  result--viz., since in the competition a vast number must perish, nature  selects for preservation only the strongest specimens. With our  race, therefore, even before the discovery of vril, only the highest  organisations were preserved; and there is among our ancient books a  legend, once popularly believed, that we were driven from a region  that seems to denote the world you come from, in order to perfect our  condition and attain to the purest elimination of our species by the  severity of the struggles our forefathers underwent; and that, when our  education shall become finally completed, we are destined to return  to the upper world, and supplant all the inferior races now existing  therein.\"    Aph-Lin and Zee often conversed with me in private upon the  political and social conditions of that upper world, in which Zee so  philosophically assumed that the inhabitants were to be exterminated  one day or other by the advent of the Vril-ya. They found in my  accounts,--in which I continued to do all I could (without launching  into falsehoods so positive that they would have been easily detected by  the shrewdness of my listeners) to present our powers and ourselves in  the most flattering point of view,--perpetual subjects of comparison  between our most civilised populations and the meaner subterranean races  which they considered hopelessly plunged in barbarism, and doomed to  gradual if certain extinction. But they both agreed in desiring to  conceal from their community all premature opening into the regions  lighted by the sun; both were humane, and shrunk from the thought of  annihilating so many millions of creatures; and the pictures I drew of  our life, highly coloured as they were, saddened them. In vain I boasted  of our great men--poets, philosophers, orators, generals--and defied the  Vril-ya to produce their equals. \"Alas,\" said Zee, \"this predominance  of the few over the many is the surest and most fatal sign of a race  incorrigibly savage. See you not that the primary condition of mortal  happiness consists in the extinction of that strife and competition  between individuals, which, no matter what forms of government they  adopt, render the many subordinate to the few, destroy real liberty to  the individual, whatever may be the nominal liberty of the state, and  annul that calm of existence, without which, felicity, mental or bodily,  cannot be attained? Our notion is, that the more we can assimilate life  to the existence which our noblest ideas can conceive to be that of  spirits on the other side of the grave, why, the more we approximate  to a divine happiness here, and the more easily we glide into the  conditions of being hereafter. For, surely, all we can imagine of the  life of gods, or of blessed immortals, supposes the absence of self-made  cares and contentious passions, such as avarice and ambition. It seems  to us that it must be a life of serene tranquility, not indeed without  active occupations to the intellectual or spiritual powers,  but occupations, of whatsoever nature they be, congenial to the  idiosyncrasies of each, not forced and repugnant--a life gladdened by  the untrammelled interchange of gentle affections, in which the moral  atmosphere utterly kills hate and vengeance, and strife and rivalry.  Such is the political state to which all the tribes and families of  the Vril-ya seek to attain, and towards that goal all our theories of  government are shaped. You see how utterly opposed is such a progress to  that of the uncivilised nations from which you come, and which aim at  a systematic perpetuity of troubles, and cares, and warring passions  aggravated more and more as their progress storms its way onward. The  most powerful of all the races in our world, beyond the pale of the  Vril-ya, esteems itself the best governed of all political societies,  and to have reached in that respect the extreme end at which political  wisdom can arrive, so that the other nations should tend more or less to  copy it. It has established, on its broadest base, the Koom-Posh--viz.,  the government of the ignorant upon the principle of being the most  numerous. It has placed the supreme bliss in the vying with each other  in all things, so that the evil passions are never in repose--vying for  power, for wealth, for eminence of some kind; and in this rivalry it  is horrible to hear the vituperation, the slanders, and calumnies which  even the best and mildest among them heap on each other without remorse  or shame.\"    \"Some years ago,\" said Aph-Lin, \"I visited this people, and their  misery and degradation were the more appalling because they were always  boasting of their felicity and grandeur as compared with the rest of  their species. And there is no hope that this people, which evidently  resembles your own, can improve, because all their notions tend to  further deterioration. They desire to enlarge their dominion more and  more, in direct antagonism to the truth that, beyond a very limited  range, it is impossible to secure to a community the happiness which  belongs to a well-ordered family; and the more they mature a system  by which a few individuals are heated and swollen to a size above the  standard slenderness of the millions, the more they chuckle and exact,  and cry out, 'See by what great exceptions to the common littleness of  our race we prove the magnificent results of our system!'\"    \"In fact,\" resumed Zee, \"if the wisdom of human life be to approximate  to the serene equality of immortals, there can be no more direct flying  off into the opposite direction than a system which aims at carrying  to the utmost the inequalities and turbulences of mortals. Nor do I see  how, by any forms of religious belief, mortals, so acting, could fit  themselves even to appreciate the joys of immortals to which they still  expect to be transferred by the mere act of dying. On the contrary,  minds accustomed to place happiness in things so much the reverse of  godlike, would find the happiness of gods exceedingly dull, and would  long to get back to a world in which they could quarrel with each  other.\"        Chapter XVI.      I have spoken so much of the Vril Staff that my reader may expect me  to describe it. This I cannot do accurately, for I was never allowed to  handle it for fear of some terrible accident occasioned by my ignorance  of its use; and I have no doubt that it requires much skill and practice  in the exercise of its various powers. It is hollow, and has in the  handle several stops, keys, or springs by which its force can be  altered, modified, or directed--so"]]]
