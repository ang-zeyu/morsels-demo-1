I played the harmonium for the choir practice,  and kept the books for the Guilds and Societies.  His daughter was ill,  and there was no one else to take her place, so, of course, I went at  once.  It is quite a tiny little country place--Condleton, in  Loamshire.\"    \"What!\" cried Rhoda, and sat erect in her seat sparkling with animation.  \"Condleton!  I know it quite well.  I often drive over there with my  ponies.  It is only six miles from our place, and such a pretty drive.  I know the Vicarage quite well, and the Church, and the funny little  cross in the High Street!\"    She spoke perfectly simply, and without thought of ostentation, for her  parents' riches had come when she herself was so young that she had no  remembrance of the little house in the manufacturing town, but looked as  a matter of course upon the luxuries with which she was surrounded.  It  never occurred to her mind that any of her remarks could be looked upon  as boasting, but there was a universal glancing and smiling round the  room, and Thomasina enquired gravely:    \"Do you drive the same pair every day?\"    \"Of ponies?  Oh, yes, generally,\" replied Rhoda innocently.  \"They are  frisky little things, and need exercise.  Of course if we go a very long  way, I give them a rest next day and drive the cobs, but as a rule they  go out regularly.\"    Thomasina shook her head in solemnest disapproval.  \"That's a mistake!  You should change _every_ day.  The merciful man is merciful to his  beast.  I can't endure to see people thoughtless in these matters.  My  stud groom has special orders _never_ to send out the postilions on the  same mounts oftener than twice a week!\"    There was a moment's pause, and then a shriek of laughter.  Girls threw  themselves back in their seats, and held their sides with their hands;  girls stamped on the floor, and rolled about as though they could not  contain their delight; girls mopped their eyes and gasped, \"Oh, dear!  oh, dear!\" and grew red up to the roots of their hair.  And Rhoda's face  shone out, pale and fixed, in a white fury of anger.    \"You are a very rude, ill-bred girl, Thomasina Bolderston!  I made an  innocent remark, and you twist it about so as to insult me before all  the house!  You will ask my pardon at once if you have any right  feeling.\"    \"I'm the Head Girl, my dear.  The Head Girl doesn't ask pardon of a  silly new-comer who can't take a joke!\"    \"I fail to see where the joke comes in.  If you are Head Girl a dozen  times over, it doesn't alter the fact that you don't know how to behave.  You have bullied me and made me miserable ever since I came to this  school, and I won't stand it any longer, and so I give you notice!\"    \"Much obliged, but it's no use.  The rules of this school are that the  pupils must obey the Head Girl in her own department, and there can be  no exception in your favour, unpleasant as you find my yoke.\"    \"When _I_ am a Head Girl I shall try to be worthy of the position.  I'll  be kind to new girls, and set them a good example.  I'll not jeer at  them and make them so wretched that they wish they never had been born!\"    Thomasina leant her head on her hand, and gazed fixedly into the angry  face.  She made no reply, but there was no lack of speakers to vindicate  her honour.  Sneering voices rose on every side in a clamour of  indignant protest.    \"When _she_ is Head Girl indeed!  It will be a good time before _that_  happens, I should say.\"    \"Not in our day, let us hope.  We are not worthy to be under such a  mistress.\"    \"Oh my goodness, what a pattern she will be; what a shining example!  You can see her wings even now beginning to sprout.\"    \"Nonsense, child!  It's not wings, it's only round shoulders.  These  growing girls _will_ stoop.  You had better be careful, or you will be  set in order next.\"    Rhoda looked across the room with smarting, tear-filled eyes.    \"Don't alarm yourselves; I wouldn't condescend to bandy words.  You are  like our leader--not worthy of notice!\"    \"Look here, Rhoda Chester, say what you like about us, but leave  Thomasina alone.  We will not have our Head Girl insulted, if we know  it.  If you say another word we will turn you out into the passage.\"    \"Thank you, Beatrice; no need to get excited; I can fight my own battles  without your help.  This little difference is between Rhoda and me, and  we must settle it together.  I think we could talk matters over more  comfortably in my study, without interrupting your rest hour.  May I  trouble you, Miss Chester?  Three doors along the passage.  I won't take  you far out of your way!\"    Thomasina rose from her seat, and waved her hand towards the door.  She  was all smiles and blandness, but a gasp of dismay sounded through the  room, as if a private interview in the Head Girl's study was no light  thing to contemplate.    Rhoda's heart beat fast with apprehension.  What was going to happen.  What would take place next?  It was like the invitation of the spider to  the fly--full of subtle terror.  Nevertheless, her pride would not allow  her to object, and, throwing back her head, she marched promptly, and  without hesitation, along the corridor.        CHAPTER NINE.    HAVING IT OUT.    Thomasina led the way into her study, and shut the door behind her.  It  was a bare little room, singularly free from those photographs and nick-  nacks with which most girls love to adorn a private sanctum.  It looked  what it was--a workroom pure and simple, with a pile of writing  materials on the table, and the walls ornamented with maps and sheets of  paper, containing jottings of the hours of classes and games.  On the  mantelpiece reposed a ball of string, a dogskin glove, a matchbox, and a  photograph of an elderly gentleman, whose pike-like aspect sufficiently  proclaimed his relationship.  There were three straight-back chairs,  supplied by the school, and two easier ones of Thomasina's own  providing, both in the last stages of invalidism.    The mistress of this luxurious domain turned towards her visitor with a  hospitable smile.    \"Sit down,\" she cried, \"make yourself comfortable.  Not that chair--the  spokes have given way, and it might land you on the floor.  Try the  blue, and keep your skirts to the front, so that it won't catch on the  nails.  I can't think how it is that my chairs go wrong.  I'm always  tinkering at them.  Nice little study, isn't it?  So cosy!\"    \"Ye-es!\" assented Rhoda, who privately thought it the most forlorn-  looking apartment she had ever seen, but was in no mood to discuss  either its merits or demerits.  It was in no friendly spirit that she  had paid this visit; then why waste time on foolish preliminaries?  She  looked expectantly at Thomasina, and Thomasina stood in front of the  chimney-piece with both hands thrust into the side pockets of her  bicycling skirt, jingling their contents in an easy, gentlemanly  fashion.  From her leathern band depended a steel chain which lost  itself in the depths of the right-hand pocket.  Rhoda felt an  unaccountable curiosity to discover what hung at the end of that chain  and rattled in so uncanny a fashion.    \"Well!\" began Thomasina, tilting herself slowly forward on the points of  her flat, wide shoes, \"Well, and now about this little matter.  I asked  you to step in here because I think differences of opinion are more  easily settled without an audience, and as it were, man to man.\"  She  buried her chin in her necktie, and gazed across the room with a calm,  speculative glance.  The likeness between her and the pike-like  gentleman grew more startling every moment.  \"Now, we have known each  other barely a week, and already I have offended you deeply, and you,  without knowing it, have hit me on a tender spot.  It is time that we  came to an understanding.  Before going any further, however, there are  one or two questions I should like to ask.  You have had time to notice  a good many things since you arrived.  You have seen me constantly with  the girls.  Do they dislike me?  Do they speak of me hardly behind my  back?  Do they consider me a bully or a sneak?  Should you say on the  whole that I was popular or unpopular?\"    \"Popular!\" said Rhoda firmly.  Whatever happened she would speak the  truth, and not quibble with obvious facts.  \"They like you very much.\"    \"And you wonder how they can, eh?  Nevertheless it's true.  I'll tell  you something more.  I'm the most popular Head Girl at Hurst.  You ask  the other colours to-morrow, and they'll tell you to a man that you are  lucky to have me.  Very well then, Rhoda, who's to blame if you think  the opposite?  Yourself, and nobody but yourself, as I'll proceed to  prove.  You come to school with a flourish of trumpets, thinking you are  doing us a mighty big favour by settling among us, and that you are to  be allowed to amble along at your own sweet will, ignoring rules you  don't like, graciously agreeing to those you do, and prepared to turn  into a wild cat the first moment any one tries to keep you in order.  Then, when you are unhappy, as you jolly well deserve to be, you turn  and rend me, and say it is my fault.  If all the new girls behaved as  you have done, I should have been in my little tomb long ago, and you  would have some one else to deal with.  It seems to me, my dear, that  you don't recognise my duties.  I am placed in a position of authority,  and am bound to enforce the rules.  If the girls are obedient, well and  good; if they kick, well and good also.  _I break 'em in_!  I'm going to  break _you_ in, Rhoda Chester, and the sooner you realise it the happier  you'll be.\"    Rhoda looked at her fully, with a firmness of chin, a straightness of  eye, which argued ill for the success of the project.    \"You will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#13)"],[1," illustrate his  subject. The exciting part of the business was the necessity of making  the capture before eleven o'clock, when the carrier would pass by, and,  taking charge of the animal, would deliver it in time for the lecture  next day. We watched for the upheaving of the mole's run which came at  last. The gardener made a quick plunge with his hand into the soft  earth, but alas! the mole escaped. He kept quiet for ten minutes, then  another attempt was made, and failed. The carrier's bell sounded and he  passed by. I still kept watch, and again saw the earth move--the third  time was successful. I had gone to find a tin box, and on my return I  was greeted with \"Here's the mole, ma'am!\" Poor fellow! he was being  ignominiously held up by the scruff of his neck, and kicking furiously  at the indignity. He was soon packed up in soft grass, with a plentiful  supply of worms to feast upon by the way. A special messenger overtook  the carrier, and a telegram was sent to announce the dispatch of the  precious animal.    He first reached a London office, where I fear he tended to hinder  business, as it was needful to transfer him to a cage, and no one seemed  particularly anxious for the honour of catching him, as his teeth were  known to be both sharp and numerous, and his disposition not of the  meekest. However, he was placed in his cage, travelled down into Kent,  and gave wonderful pleasure when exhibited to the children.    One would naturally suppose that in a country village where boys and  girls are daily going to and from school, they would all have been  familiar with this little creature, but when the question was asked if  they had ever seen a dead mole, only fifteen children out of ninety had  seen one, and only three had ever seen a live one.    Next day the mole was let loose upon a very hard piece of ground, but  even there he very quickly burrowed out of sight.          [Illustration]    HARVEST MICE.      I had often wished to keep these interesting little animals, but as they  are only found in some parts of England and are difficult to capture  from their minute size and delicacy, I had to wait many years before  they could be obtained. At length, through the kindness of a friend, six  were sent to me from Norfolk, and for two years they lived in captivity  and afforded me much pleasure.    They are the smallest English rodents, two of them only weighing a  halfpenny; they are brown in colour with white underneath, very long  whiskers and prehensile tails. They were made happy by finding all  things needful for their comfort in a large plant case. A thick layer of  cocoa fibre was spread over the bottom of the case, dry moss and hay  provided, wheat-ears, oats, and canary seed, and a small cup of water. A  flowerpot in which a number of small branches were fixed afforded  opportunity for exercise in climbing, and a pleasant resting-place was  formed by a half-cocoanut filled with cotton-wool and roofed over with  dry moss, then slung by three wires in a tripod of sticks of  corky-barked elm, a little hole for entrance being left at one side.  Into this the mice went the moment they were turned into the case, and  in it they mostly lived. I fancy its swinging a little as they moved  inside was congenial to their ideas of comfort. As they live in  cornfields and make a pendulous nest attached to an ear of corn, I  supplied them with a pot of growing wheat, in the hope that they would  incline to make a nest in it; but I could never induce them to rear a  family. They would sit for hours in the corn-stalks and nibble them  into a heap of shreds, but no nest ever appeared. Their greatest delight  was a handful of fresh moss full of little insects on which they would  feed. The greatest excitement was always shown when the moss  appeared--little heads would peep out of the cocoa-husk, little noses  sniffed in all directions, and then, with jerky runs, the tiny folk made  their way to the attractive spot, and soon each would be seen sitting up  like a small kangaroo feasting on a beetle or spider held in the tiny  paws. Sometimes in their great happiness they made a low, sweet chirping  like a company of wrens conversing cheerily together. When climbing in  their tree-branches it was interesting to see how the fine wiry tail was  always coiled round the stem as the creature descended, so as to keep it  from falling and injuring itself.    Canary seed and brown bread seemed a favourite diet, and if I put a  trough of growing corn into the case the mice made little burrows  through it so as to be able to eat the wheat from below. I had heard a  sad report that my fairy-like pets had a tendency to eat each other as  spring came round! This I fancied might arise from lack of animal food,  so once or twice a week I always gave them a small portion of meat and  this seemed to prevent any tendency to cannibalism.    After keeping them two years several deaths occurred, so I thought the  remainder should have their liberty, and I had the pleasure of seeing  them enter one of my corn-stacks where I hope they found all that their  little hearts could desire, and possibly they would stray to a  neighbouring bank and found a colony.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE CALIFORNIAN MOUSE.      A rather strange parcel from California reached me by post some years  ago. It was marked \"Live animals with care,\" and consisted of a box,  containing several divisions, each having fine wire-work to admit air.  In one I found a spiny creature called a Gecko, in another a beautiful  lizard which had not survived the journey, and in the third a very rare  species of mouse known as _Perognathus Pencillatus_. It has a soft silky  coat of silver grey and fawn colour, and a long tail with a little tuft  at the end, very large black eyes and white paws. It was alive, but weak  and tired with its journey of ten days and all the jars and shocks it  must have had by the way. I gave it warm milk and soaked bread, which it  seemed to enjoy, and some hours later it was supplied with wheat grains,  the food upon which it lives in its native country.    True to his natural instinct, mousie soon began to fill both his cheek  pouches with the corn, and tried to hide it away as a supply for the  future. In a few days the little creature was in perfect health, and he  has been a great pet now for several years; perfectly tame and gentle,  he will run about on the table and amuse himself happily wherever he is  placed.    Being entirely inodorous he is kept in the drawing-room in a mahogany  cage which was made specially to meet his small requirements. He is a  busy little creature at night, as he likes daily to make a fresh bed of  cotton-wool, and fusses about with his mouth full of material until he  has arranged his little couch.    In his own country, where the cold is very severe in winter, its habit  is to become perfectly unconscious, exactly as if dead, and in that  state it can endure the rigour of the climate and wake up when the  temperature rises. It was once left in a cold room and became in this  apparently lifeless state. I was not alarmed, as I knew of its  peculiarity, but it really was difficult to believe it ever could  revive; there was no trace of warmth, or any apparent beating of the  heart, and so it lay for some days, but on bringing it into a warm room  it became as bright and active as ever. It seems a more intense form of  hibernation than that of our squirrel and dormouse.    The naturalist at San Bernardino, from whom I obtained this mouse, told  me he had kept one as a pet for many years, and his specimen lived  entirely without water; as there was sufficient moisture in the wheat  grains on which it fed to supply its need; but I think it is cruel to  keep anything without the means of quenching thirst which might arise  from an artificial mode of life, so my little pet has always a small jar  of water to which I know it resorts from its requiring to be refilled  from time to time.          [Illustration]    SANCHO THE TOAD.      About four years ago I began to feed a toad that had found its way into  the conservatory. He sat daily in one place expecting his meal-worms,  and when he had snapped them up with his curious sticky tongue he would  retire to some hidden nook and be invisible until the next day. Each  winter he has hibernated as soon as cold weather began, and reappeared  with the spring sunshine. Sancho is now a very portly, and most amusing  pet.    Few people would guess how much character can be shown by even this  poor, despised reptile when treated with real kindness, regularly fed,  and never frightened or abused. I will describe what happens when Sancho  is \"shown to the public.\"    Some meal-worms are thrown on the pavement near him. He sits for a time  gazing at them with his gold-rimmed eyes; then slowly creeps towards  them, fixes his eyes on one of the worms bends his head a little towards  it, then one hears a snap and the prey is taken. The act is so rapid  that one can never see the tongue that has picked up the  meal-worm--simply it is gone! The toad's eyes are tightly shut whilst he  swallows the morsel, and then he turns to pick up a second. Now is the  time to approach him from behind and begin to stroke his leathery, warty  skin. In a few seconds he is in a state of perfect ecstasy, his front  legs are stretched out, he leans first to one side, then to the other,  to guide the hand where he wishes to be stroked, and at last uplifts his  ponderous body until he is an inch or more from the ground, supported on  the tips of his toes. No description can do justice to the absurdity of  the attitude, and the rapture seems so intense that food is forgotten,  and so long as Sancho can get any one to stroke him, he is quite  oblivious to all around him, although at other times he will hop away as  soon as any stranger approaches.    Sancho will not, as yet, take"]]]
