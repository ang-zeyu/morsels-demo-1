But as some naval force was obviously necessary  during the construction of this fleet, five vessels were procured, and  the new navy was organized with the following roster of officers:--      Esek Hopkins        _Commander-in-chief._    Dudley Saltonstall  _Captain of the \"Alfred.\"_    Abraham Whipple     _Captain of the \"Columbus.\"_    Nicholas Biddle     _Captain of the \"Andrea Doria.\"_    John B. Hopkins     _Captain of the \"Cabot.\"_    A long list of lieutenants was also provided, among whom stands out  boldly the name of John Paul Jones. John Manly, whose dashing work in  the schooner \"Lee\" we have already noticed, was left in command of his  little craft until the thirty-two-gun ship \"Hancock\" was completed,  when he was put in charge of her.    It may possibly have occurred to some of my readers to wonder what  flag floated from the mastheads of these ships. There is much  confusion upon this point, and not a little uncertainty. There were  three classes of American armed vessels on the seas. First were the  privateers, that sailed under any flag that might suit their purpose.  Next came the vessels fitted out and commissioned by the individual  colonies; these usually floated the flag of the colony from which they  hailed. Last came the vessels commissioned by Congress, which at the  outset floated many banners of diverse kinds. It fell to the lot of  Lieut. Paul Jones, however, to hoist the first authorized American  flag over a regularly commissioned vessel-of-war. This flag was of  bunting, showing a pine-tree on a plain white ground, with the words  \"Liberty Tree\" and \"Appeal to God\" prominently displayed. This flag  was chiefly used until the adoption of the stars and stripes. The  \"rattlesnake flag,\" with a reptile in the act of striking, and the  legend \"Don't tread on me,\" was largely used by the privateers.    The year 1775 closed with but little activity upon the ocean. The  ships of the regular navy were late in getting into commission, and an  early winter impeded their usefulness. Some little work was done by  privateers and the ships of the different colonies, and the ships of  the British navy were kept fully occupied in guarding against the  operations of these gentry. The man-of-war \"Nautilus\" chased an  American privateer into a little cove near Beverly, and in the heat of  the chase both vessels ran aground. The people on shore put off to the  privateer, and quickly stripped her of her cordage and armament, and  with the guns built a small battery by the water-side, from which they  opened a telling fire upon the stranded \"Nautilus.\" The man-of-war  returned in kind, and did some slight damage to the town; but when the  tide had risen she slipped her cables and departed. Such desultory  encounters were of frequent occurrence, but no naval battles of any  importance took place until the spring of 1776.

EVENTS OF 1776. -- THE FIRST CRUISE OF THE REGULAR NAVY. --       THE \"LEXINGTON\" AND THE \"EDWARD.\" -- MUGFORD'S BRAVE FIGHT.       -- LOSS OF THE \"YANKEE HERO.\" -- CAPT. MANLY, AND THE       \"DEFENCE.\" -- AMERICAN VESSELS IN EUROPEAN WATERS. -- GOOD       WORK OF THE \"LEXINGTON\" AND THE \"REPRISAL.\" -- THE BRITISH       DEFEATED AT CHARLESTON.      The year 1776 witnessed some good service done for the cause of  liberty by the little colonial navy. The squadron, under the command  of Ezekiel Hopkins, left the Delaware in February, as soon as the ice  had left the river, and made a descent upon the island of New  Providence, where the British had established a naval station. The  force under Hopkins consisted of seven vessels-of-war, and one  despatch-boat. The attack was successful in every way, a landing party  of three hundred marines and sailors which was sent ashore meeting  with but little resistance from the British garrison. By this exploit,  the Americans captured over a hundred cannon, and a great quantity of  naval stores.    After this exploit, Hopkins left New Providence, carrying away with  him the governor and one or two notable citizens, and continued his  cruise. His course was shaped to the northward, and early in April he  found himself off the shore of Long Island. He had picked up a couple  of insignificant British vessels,--one a tender of six guns, and the  other an eight-gun bomb-brig. But his cruise had been mainly barren of  results; and his crew, who had looked forward to sharp service and  plenty of prize-money, were beginning to grumble. But their inactivity  was not of long duration; for before daylight on the morning of April  6, the lookout at the masthead of the \"Alfred\" sighted a large ship,  bearing down upon the American squadron. The night was clear and  beautiful, the wind light, and the sea smooth; and so, although it  lacked several hours to daylight, the commanders determined to give  battle to the stranger. Soon, therefore, the roll of the drums beating  to quarters was heard over the water, and the angry glare of the  battle lanterns on the gun-decks made the open ports of the war-ships  stand out like fiery eyes against the black hulls. The Englishman, who  proved later to be the \"Glasgow,\" twenty guns, carrying one hundred  and fifty men, might easily have escaped; but, apparently undaunted by  the odds against him, he awaited the attack. The little \"Cabot\" was  the first American ship to open fire on the enemy. Her attack, though  sharp and plucky, was injudicious; for two of the Englishman's heavy  broadsides were enough to send her out of the battle for repairs. The  \"Glasgow\" and the \"Alfred\" then took up the fight, and exchanged  repeated broadsides; the American vessel suffering the more serious  injuries of the two. After some hours of this fighting, the \"Glasgow\"  hauled away, and made good her escape, although she was almost  surrounded by the vessels of the American squadron. It would seem that  only the most careless seamanship on the part of the Americans could  have enabled a twenty-gun vessel to escape from four vessels, each one  of which was singly almost a match for her. It is evident that the  Continental Congress took the same view of the matter, for Hopkins was  soon after dismissed from the service.    This action was little to the credit of the sailors of the colonial  navy. Fortunately, a second action during the same month set them in a  better light before the people of the country. This was the encounter  of the \"Lexington,\" Capt. Barry, with the British vessel \"Edward,\" off  the capes of Virginia. The two vessels were laid yard-arm to yard-arm;  and a hot battle ensued, in which the Americans came off the victors.  The career of this little American brig was a rather remarkable one.  The year following her capture of the \"Edward,\" she was again off the  capes of the Delaware, and again fell in with a British ship. This  time, however, the Englishman was a frigate, and the luckless  \"Lexington\" was forced to surrender. Her captor left the Americans  aboard their own craft, and, putting a prize crew aboard, ordered them  to follow in the wake of the frigate. That night the Americans plotted  the recapture of their vessel. By a concerted movement, they  overpowered their captors; and the \"Lexington\" was taken into  Baltimore, where she was soon recommissioned, and ordered to cruise in  European waters.    Shortly after the battle between the \"Lexington\" and the \"Edward,\"  there was fought in Massachusetts Bay an action in which the Americans  showed the most determined bravery, and which for the courage shown,  and losses suffered on either side, may well be regarded as the most  important of the naval battles of that year. Early in May, a merchant  seaman named Mugford had succeeded, after great importunity, in  securing the command of the armed vessel \"Franklin,\" a small cruiser  mounting only four guns. The naval authorities had been unwilling to  give him the command, though he showed great zeal in pressing his  suit. Indeed, after the appointment had been made, certain damaging  rumors concerning the newly appointed captain reached the ears of the  marine committee, and caused them to send an express messenger to  Boston to cancel Mugford's commission. But the order arrived too late.  Mugford had already fitted out his ship, and sailed. He had been but a  few days at sea, when the British ship \"Hope,\" of four hundred tons  and mounting six guns, hove in sight. More than this, the lookout  reported that the fleet of the British commodore Banks lay but a few  miles away, and in plain sight. Many a man would have been daunted by  such odds. Not so Capt. Mugford. Mustering his men, he showed them the  British ship, told them that she carried heavier metal than the  \"Franklin,\" told them that the British fleet lay near at hand, and  would doubtless try to take a hand in the engagement; then, having  pointed out all the odds against them, he said, \"Now, my lads, it's a  desperate case; but we can take her, and win lots of glory and  prize-money. Will you stand by me?\"    The jackies wasted no time in debate, but, cheering lustily for the  captain, went to their posts, and made ready for a hot fight. The  naval discipline of the present day was little known, and less  observed, at that time in the American navy. The perfect order which  makes the gun-deck of a ship going into action as quiet and solemn as  during Sunday prayers then gave place to excited talk and bustle.

But here begin your pity:         Shows the Children strangled.    Alas, how have these offended?      FERDINAND.                      The death    Of young wolves is never to be pitied.

The element of water moistens the earth,    But blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens.      FERDINAND.  Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle:  she died young.      BOSOLA.  I think not so; her infelicity    Seem'd to have years too many.      FERDINAND.  She and I were twins;    And should I die this instant, I had liv'd    Her time to a minute.      BOSOLA.                It seems she was born first:    You have bloodily approv'd the ancient truth,    That kindred commonly do worse agree    Than remote strangers.      FERDINAND.              Let me see her face    Again.  Why didst thou not pity her?  What    An excellent honest man mightst thou have been,    If thou hadst borne her to some sanctuary!    Or, bold in a good cause, oppos'd thyself,    With thy advanced sword above thy head,    Between her innocence and my revenge!    I bade thee, when I was distracted of my wits,    Go kill my dearest friend, and thou hast done 't.    For let me but examine well the cause:    What was the meanness of her match to me?    Only I must confess I had a hope,    Had she continu'd widow, to have gain'd    An infinite mass of treasure by her death:    And that was the main cause,--her marriage,    That drew a stream of gall quite through my heart.    For thee, as we observe in tragedies    That a good actor many times is curs'd    For playing a villain's part, I hate thee for 't,    And, for my sake, say, thou hast done much ill well.      BOSOLA.  Let me quicken your memory, for I perceive    You are falling into ingratitude:  I challenge    The reward due to my service.      FERDINAND.                     I 'll tell thee    What I 'll give thee.      BOSOLA.                Do.      FERDINAND.                  I 'll give thee a pardon    For this murder.      BOSOLA.           Ha!      FERDINAND.             Yes, and 'tis    The largest bounty I can study to do thee.    By what authority didst thou execute    This bloody sentence?      BOSOLA.                By yours.      FERDINAND.  Mine! was I her judge?    Did any ceremonial form of law    Doom her to not-being?  Did a complete jury    Deliver her conviction up i' the court?    Where shalt thou find this judgment register'd,    Unless in hell?  See, like a bloody fool,    Thou 'st forfeited thy life, and thou shalt die for 't.      BOSOLA.  The office of justice is perverted quite    When one thief hangs another.  Who shall dare    To reveal this?      FERDINAND.       O, I 'll tell thee;    The wolf shall find her grave, and scrape it up,    Not to devour the corpse, but to discover    The horrid murder.      BOSOLA.             You, not I, shall quake for 't.      FERDINAND.  Leave me.      BOSOLA.                I will first receive my pension.      FERDINAND.  You are a villain.      BOSOLA.                         When your ingratitude    Is judge, I am so.      FERDINAND.          O horror,    That not the fear of him which binds the devils    Can prescribe man obedience!--    Never look upon me more.      BOSOLA.                   Why, fare thee well.    Your brother and yourself are worthy men!    You have a pair of hearts are hollow graves,    Rotten, and rotting others; and your vengeance,    Like two chain'd-bullets, still goes arm in arm:    You may be brothers; for treason, like the plague,    Doth take much in a blood.  I stand like one    That long hath ta'en a sweet and golden dream:    I am angry with myself, now that I wake.      FERDINAND.  Get thee into some unknown part o' the world,    That I may never see thee.      BOSOLA.                     Let me know    Wherefore I should be thus neglected.  Sir,    I serv'd your tyranny, and rather strove    To satisfy yourself than all the world:    And though I loath'd the evil, yet I lov'd    You that did counsel it; and rather sought    To appear a true servant than an honest man.      FERDINAND.  I 'll go hunt the badger by owl-light:    'Tis a deed of darkness.         Exit.      BOSOLA.  He 's much distracted.  Off, my painted honour!    While with vain hopes our faculties we tire,    We seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire.    What would I do, were this to do again?    I would not change my peace of conscience    For all the wealth of Europe.--She stirs; here 's life:--    Return, fair soul, from darkness, and lead mine    Out of this sensible hell:--she 's warm, she breathes:--    Upon thy pale lips I will melt my heart,    To store them with fresh colour.--Who 's there?    Some cordial drink!--Alas!  I dare not call:    So pity would destroy pity.--Her eye opes,    And heaven in it seems to ope, that late was shut,    To take me up to mercy.      DUCHESS.  Antonio!      BOSOLA.             Yes, madam, he is living;    The dead bodies you saw were but feign'd statues.    He 's reconcil'd to your brothers; the Pope hath wrought    The atonement.      DUCHESS.        Mercy!         Dies.      BOSOLA.  O, she 's gone again! there the cords of life broke.    O sacred innocence, that sweetly sleeps    On turtles' feathers, whilst a guilty conscience    Is a black register wherein is writ    All our good deeds and bad, a perspective    That shows us hell!  That we cannot be suffer'd    To do good when we have a mind to it!    This is manly sorrow;    These tears, I am very certain, never grew    In my mother's milk.  My estate is sunk    Below the degree of fear:  where were    These penitent fountains while she was living?    O, they were frozen up!  Here is a sight    As direful to my soul as is the sword    Unto a wretch hath slain his father.    Come, I 'll bear thee hence,    And execute thy last will; that 's deliver    Thy body to the reverend dispose    Of some good women:  that the cruel tyrant    Shall not deny me.  Then I 'll post to Milan,    Where somewhat I will speedily enact    Worth my dejection.         Exit [with the body].
