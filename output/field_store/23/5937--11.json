They have worked their way across the marshes, with  their dredges, under cover of their gunboats, to the Savannah River,  about Fort Pulaski. I presume they will endeavour to reduce the fort and  thus open a way for their vessels up the river. But we have an interior  line they must force before reaching the city. It is on this line we are  working, slowly to my anxious mind, but as fast as I can drive them....  Good-bye, my dear child. May God bless you and our poor country.    \"Your devoted father,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    Soon after this letter was written my father was recalled to Richmond,  \"and was assigned on the 13th of March, under the direction of the  President, to the conduct of the military operations of all the armies  of the Confederate States\" [\"Four Years with General Lee\"]. My mother  was still at the White House, my brother's place on the Pamunkey, and  there my father wrote to her:    \"Richmond, March 14, 1862.    \"My Dear Mary: I have been trying all the week to write to you, but have  not been able. I have been placed on duty here to conduct operations  under the direction of the President. It will give me great pleasure to  do anything I can to relieve him and serve the country, but I do not see  either advantage or pleasure in my duties. But I will not complain, but  do my best. I do not see at present either that it will enable me to see  much more of you. In the present condition of affairs no one can foresee  what may happen, nor in my judgement is it advisable for any one to make  arrangements with a view to permanency or pleasure. The presence of some  one at the White House is necessary as long as practicable. How long it  will be practicable for you an Charlotte to remain there I cannot say.  The enemy is pushing us back in all directions, and how far he will be  successful depends much upon our efforts and the mercy of Providence. I  shall, in all human probability, soon have to take the field, so for  the present I think things had better remain as they are. Write me your  views. If you think it best for you to come to Richmond I can soon make  arrangements for your comfort and shall be very glad of your company and  presence. We have experienced a great affliction both in our private and  public relations. Our good and noble Bishop Meade died last night. He  was very anxious to see you, sent you his love and kindest remembrances,  and had I known in time yesterday I should have sent expressly for you  to come up. But I did not know of his wish or condition till after the  departure of the cars yesterday. Between 6 and 7 P. M. yesterday he sent  for me, said he wished to bid me good-bye, and to give me his blessing,  which he did in the most affecting manner. Called me Robert and reverted  to the time I used to say the catechism to him. He invoked the blessing  of God upon me and the country. He spoke with difficulty and pain, but  was perfectly calm and clear. His hand was then cold and pulseless, yet  he shook mine warmly. 'I ne'er shall look upon his like again.' He  died during the night. I presume the papers of to-morrow will tell you  all....    \"Very truly and sincerely,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    The next day he again writes to my mother.    \"Richmond, March 15, 1861.    \"My Dear Mary: I wrote you yesterday by mail. On returning to my  quarters last night after 11 P. M. Custis informed me Robert had  arrived and had made up his mind to go into the army. He stayed at  the Spottswood, and this morning I went with him to get his overcoat,  blankets, etc. There is great difficulty in procuring what is good.  They all have to be made, and he has gone to the office of the  adjutant-general of Virginia to engage in the service. God grant it may  be for his good as He has permitted it. I must be resigned. I told him  of the exemption granted by the Secretary of War to the professors and  students of the university, but he expressed no desire to take advantage  of it. It would be useless for him to go, if he did not improve himself,  nor would I wish him to go merely for exemption. As I have done all in  the matter that seems proper and right, I must now leave the rest in the  hands of our merciful God. I hope our son will do his duty and make a  good soldier.... I had expected yesterday to go to North Carolina this  morning, but the President changed his mind. I should like to go to see  you to-morrow, but in the present condition of things do not feel that I  ought to be absent.... I may have to go to North Carolina or Norfolk  yet. New Berne, N. C., has fallen into the hands of the enemy. In  Arkansas our troops under Van Dorn have had a hard battle, but nothing  decisive gained. Four generals killed--McIntosh, McCullogh, Herbert, and  Slack. General Price wounded. Loss on both sides said to be heavy....    \"Very truly yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"            Chapter IV -- Army Life of Robert the Younger      Volunteer in Rockbridge Artillery--\"Four Years with General Lee\"  quoted--Meeting between father and son--Personal characteristics of the  General--Death of his daughter Annie--His son Robert raised from  the ranks--the horses, \"Grace Darling\" and  \"Traveller\"--Fredricksburg--Freeing slaves      Like all the students at the university, I was wild to go into the army,  and wrote my father that I was afraid the war would be over before I  had a chance to serve. His reply was that I need have no fear of that  contingency, that I must study hard and fit myself to be useful to my  country when I was old enough to be of real service to her; so, very  properly, I was not allowed to have my wish then. In a letter to my  mother written April, '61, he says:    \"I wrote to Robert that I could not consent to take boys from their  schools and young men from their colleges and put them in the ranks at  the beginning of a war, when they are not wanted and when there are men  enough for that purpose. The war may last ten years. Where are our ranks  to be filled from then? I was willing for his company to continue at  their studies, to keep up its organisation, and to perfect themselves in  their military exercises, and to perform duty at the college; but NOT  to be called into the field. I therefore wished him to remain. If the  exercises at the college are suspended, he can then come home....\"    But in the spring of '62 he allowed me to volunteer, and I having  selected the company I wished to join, the Rockbridge Artillery, he gave  his approval, and wrote me to come to Richmond, where he would give  me my outfit. He was just as sweet and loving to me then as in the old  days. I had seen so little of him during the last six years that I stood  somewhat in awe of him. I soon found, however, that I had no cause for  such a feeling. He took great pains in getting what was necessary for  me. The baggage of a private in a Confederate battery was not extensive.  How little was needed my father, even at that time, did not know, for  though he was very careful in providing me with the least amount he  thought necessary, I soon found by experience that he had given me a  great deal too much. It was characteristic of his consideration for  others and the unselfishness of his nature, that at this time, when  weighed down, harassed and burdened by the cares incident to bringing  the untrained forces of the Confederacy into the field, and preparing  them for a struggle the seriousness of which he knew better than any  one, he should give his time and attention to the minute details of  fitting out his youngest son as a private soldier. I think it worthy of  note that the son of the commanding general enlisting as a private in  his army was not thought to be anything remarkable or unusual. Neither  my mother, my family, my friends nor myself expected any other course,  and I do not suppose it ever occurred to my father to think of giving me  an office, which he could easily have done. I know it never occurred to  me, nor did I ever hear, at that time or afterwards, from anyone, that  I might have been entitled to better rank than that of a private because  of my father's prominence in Virginia and in the Confederacy. With  the good advice to be obedient to all authority, to do my duty in  everything, great or small, he bade me good-bye, and sent me off to the  Valley of Virginia, where the command in which I was about to enlist  were serving under \"Stonewall Jackson.\"    Of my father's military duties at this time, Colonel Taylor, in his  \"Four Years with General Lee,\" says:    \"Exercising a constant supervision over the condition of affairs at each  important point, thoroughly informed as to the resources and necessities  of the several commanders of armies in the field, as well as of the  dangers which respectively threatened them, he was enabled to give them  wise counsel, to offer them valuable suggestions, and to respond to  their demands for assistance and support to such extent as the limited  resources of the government would permit. It was in great measure due  to his advice and encouragement that General Magruder so stoutly and  so gallantly held his lines on the Peninsula against General McClellan  until troops could be sent to his relief from General Johnston's army.  I recollect a telegraphic despatch received by General Lee from General  Magruder, in which he stated that a council of war which he had convened  had unanimously determined that his army should retreat, in reply to  which General Lee urged him to maintain his lines, and to make as bold  a front as possible, and encouraged him with the prospect of being  reinforced. No better illustration of the nature and importance of the  duty performed by General Lee, while in this position, can be given than  the following letter--one of a number of similar import--written by him  to General Jackson, the 'rough' or original draft of which is still in  my possession:    \"'Headquarters, Richmond, Virginia, April 29, 1862.    \"'Major-Gen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],[0,"Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#13)"],[1,"abjure them and adore      A man? It may not, may not be;      Though I should lie in pools of gore      My conscience I would hurt no more;      But I shall follow what my heart      Tells me is right, so I implore      My purpose fixed no longer thwart.        \"The coward calls black white, white black,      At bidding, or in fear of death;      Such suppleness, thank God, I lack,      To die is but to lose my breath.      Is death annihilation? No.      New worlds will open on my view,      When persecuted hence I go,      The right is right,--the true is true.\"        All's over now, the teacher thought,      Now let this reach the monarch's ear!      And instant death shall be my lot.      They parted, he in abject fear.      And soon he heard a choral song      Sung by young voices in the praise      Of gods unseen, who right all wrong,      And rule the worlds from primal days.        \"What progress have thy charges made?      Let them be called, that I may see.\"      And Sonda Marco brought as bade      His pupils to the royal knee.      Three passed the monarch's test severe,      The fourth remained: then spake the king,      \"Now, Prehlad, with attention hear,      I know thou hast the strongest wing!        \"What is the cream of knowledge, child,      Which men take such great pains to learn?\"      With folded hands he answered mild:      \"Listen, O Sire! To speak I yearn.      All sciences are nothing worth,--      Astronomy that tracks the star,      Geography that maps the earth,      Logic, and Politics, and War,--        \"And Medicine, that strives to heal      But only aggravates disease,      All, all are futile,--so I feel,      For me, O father, none of these.      That is true knowledge which can show      The glory of the living gods,--      Divest of pride, make men below      Humble and happy, though but clods.        \"That is true knowledge which can make      Us mortals, saintlike, holy, pure,      The strange thirst of the spirit slake      And strengthen suffering to endure.      That is true knowledge which can change      Our very natures, with its glow;      The sciences whate'er their range      Feed but the flesh, and make a show.\"        \"Where hast thou learnt this nonsense, boy?      Where live these gods believed so great?      Can they like me thy life destroy?      Have they such troops and royal state?      Above all gods is he who rules      The wide, wide earth, from sea to sea,      Men, devils, gods,--yea, all but fools      Bow down in fear and worship me!        \"And dares an atom from my loins      Against my kingly power rebel?      Though heaven itself to aid him joins,      His end is death--the infidel!      I warn thee yet,--bow down, thou slave,      And worship me, or thou shalt die!      We'll see what gods descend to save--      What gods with me their strength will try!\"        Thus spake the monarch in his ire,      One hand outstretched, in menace rude,      And eyes like blazing coals of fire.      And Prehlad, in unruffled mood      Straight answered him; his head bent low,      His palms joined meekly on his breast      As ever, and his cheeks aglow      His rock-firm purpose to attest.        \"Let not my words, Sire, give offence,      To thee, and to my mother, both      I give as due all reverence,      And to obey thee am not loth.      But higher duties sometimes clash      With lower,--then these last must go,--      Or there will come a fearful crash      In lamentation, fear, and woe!        \"The gods who made us are the life      Of living creatures, small and great;      We see them not, but space is rife      With their bright presence and their state.      They are the parents of us all,      'Tis they create, sustain, redeem,      Heaven, earth and hell, they hold in thrall,      And shall we these high gods blaspheme?        \"Blest is the man whose heart obeys      And makes their law of life his guide,      He shall be led in all his ways,      His footsteps shall not ever slide;      In forests dim, on raging seas,      In certain peace shall he abide,      What though he all the world displease,      His gods shall all his wants provide!\"        \"Cease, babbler! 'tis enough! I know      Thy proud, rebellious nature well.      Ho! Captain of our lifeguards, ho!      Take down this lad to dungeon-cell,      And bid the executioner wait      Our orders.\" All unmoved and calm,      He went, as reckless of his fate,      Erect and stately as a palm.        Hushed was the hall, as down he past,      No breath, no whisper, not a sign,      Through ranks of courtiers, all aghast      Like beaten hounds that dare not whine.      Outside the door, the Captain spoke,      \"Recant,\" he said beneath his breath;      \"The lion's anger to provoke      Is death, O prince, is certain death.\"        \"Thanks,\" said the prince,--\"I have revolved      The question in my mind with care,      Do what you will,--I am resolved,      To do the right, all deaths I dare.      The gods, perhaps, may please to spare      My tender years; if not,--why, still      I never shall my faith forswear,      I can but say, be done their will.\"        Whether in pity for the youth,      The headsman would not rightly ply      The weapon, or the gods in truth      Had ordered that he should not die,      Soon to the king there came report      The sword would not destroy his son,      The council held thereon was short,      The king's look frightened every one.        \"There is a spell against cold steel      Which known, the steel can work no harm,      Some sycophant with baneful zeal      Hath taught this foolish boy the charm.      It would be wise, O king, to deal      Some other way, or else I fear      Much damage to the common weal.\"      Thus spake the wily-tongued vizier.        Dark frowned the king.--\"Enough of this,--      Death, instant death, is my command!      Go throw him down some precipice,      Or bury him alive in sand.\"      With terror dumb, from that wide hall      Departed all the courtier band,      But not one man amongst them all      Dared raise against the prince his hand.        And now vague rumours ran around,      Men talked of them with bated breath:      The river has a depth profound,      The elephants trample down to death,      The poisons kill, the firebrands burn.      Had every means in turn been tried?      Some said they had,--but soon they learn      The brave young prince had not yet died.        For once more in the Council-Hall      He had been cited to appear,      'Twas open to the public all,      And all the people came in fear.      Banners were hung along the wall,      The King sat on his peacock throne,      And now the hoary Marechal      Brings in the youth,--bare skin and bone.        \"Who shall protect thee, Prehlad, now?      Against steel, poison, water, fire,      Thou art protected, men avow      Who treason, if but bold, admire.      In our own presence thou art brought      That we and all may know the truth--      Where are thy gods?--I long have sought      But never found them, hapless youth.        \"Will they come down, to prove their strength?      Will they come down, to rescue thee?      Let them come down, for once, at length,      Come one, or all, to fight with me.      Where are thy gods? Or are they dead,      Or do they hide in craven fear?      There lies my gage. None ever said      I hide from any,--far or near.\"        \"My gracious Liege, my Sire, my King!      If thou indeed wouldst deign to hear,      In humble mood, my words would spring      Like a pellucid fountain clear,      For I have in my dungeon dark      Learnt more of truth than e'er I knew,      There is one God--One only,--mark!      To Him is all our service due.        \"Hath He a shape, or hath He none?      I know not this, nor care to know,      Dwelling in light, to which the sun      Is darkness,--He sees all below,      Himself unseen! In Him I trust,      He can protect me if He will,      And if this body turn to dust,      He can new life again instil.        \"I fear not fire, I fear not sword,      All dangers, father, I can dare;      Alone, I can confront a horde,      For oh! my God is everywhere!\"      \"What! everywhere? Then in this hall,      And in this crystal pillar bright?      Now tell me plain, before us all,      Is He herein, thy God of light?\"        The monarch placed his steel-gloved hand      Upon a crystal pillar near,      In mockful jest was his demand,      The answer came, low, serious, clear:      \"Yes, father, God is even here,      And if He choose this very hour      Can strike us dead, with ghastly fear,      And vindicate His name and power.\"        \"Where is this God? Now let us see.\"      He spumed the pillar with his foot,      Down, down it tumbled, like a tree      Severed by axes from the root,      And from within, with horrid clang      That froze the blood in every vein,      A stately sable warrior sprang,      Like some phantasma of the brain.        He had a lion head and eyes,      A human body, feet and hands,      Colossal,--such strange shapes arise      In clouds, when Autumn rules the lands!      He gave a shout;--the boldest quailed,      Then struck the tyrant on the helm,      And ripped him down; and last, he hailed      Prehlad as king of all the realm!        A thunder clap--the shape was gone!      One king lay stiff, and stark, and dead,      Another on the peacock throne      Bowed reverently his youthful head.      Loud rang the trumpets; louder still      A sovereign people's wild acclaim.      The echoes ran from hill to hill,      \"Kings rule for us and in our name.\"        Tyrants of every age and clime      Remember this,--that awful shape      Shall startle you when comes the time,      And send its voice from cape to cape.      As human, peoples suffer pain,      But oh, the lion strength is theirs,      Woe to the king when galls the chain!     "]]]
