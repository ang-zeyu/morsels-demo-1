I believe they were sincere in these declarations, because  dependence had become a part of their second nature, and independence  brought with it the cares and vexations of poverty.    I was very much amused one day at the grave complaints of a good old,  simple-minded woman, fresh from a life of servitude. She had never  ventured beyond a plantation until coming North. The change was too  radical for her, and she could not exactly understand it. She thought,  as many others thought, that Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln were the government,  and that the President and his wife had nothing to do but to supply the  extravagant wants of every one that applied to them. The wants of this  old woman, however, were not very extravagant.    \"Why, Missus Keckley,\" said she to me one day, \"I is been here eight  months, and Missus Lingom an't even give me one shife. Bliss God,  childen, if I had ar know dat de Government, and Mister and Missus  Government, was going to do dat ar way, I neber would 'ave comed here in  God's wurld. My old missus us't gib me two shifes eber year.\"    I could not restrain a laugh at the grave manner in which this good old  woman entered her protest. Her idea of freedom was two or more old  shifts every year. Northern readers may not fully recognize the pith of  the joke. On the Southern plantation, the mistress, according to  established custom, every year made a present of certain under-garments  to her slaves, which articles were always anxiously looked forward to,  and thankfully received. The old woman had been in the habit of  receiving annually two shifts from her mistress, and she thought the  wife of the President of the United States very mean for overlooking  this established custom of the plantation.    While some of the emancipated blacks pined for the old associations of  slavery, and refused to help themselves, others went to work with  commendable energy, and planned with remarkable forethought. They built  themselves cabins, and each family cultivated for itself a small patch  of ground. The colored people are fond of domestic life, and with them  domestication means happy children, a fat pig, a dozen or more chickens,  and a garden. Whoever visits the Freedmen's Village now in the vicinity  of Washington will discover all of these evidences of prosperity and  happiness. The schools are objects of much interest. Good teachers,  white and colored, are employed, and whole brigades of bright-eyed dusky  children are there taught the common branches of education. These  children are studious, and the teachers inform me that their advancement  is rapid. I number among my personal friends twelve colored girls  employed as teachers in the schools at Washington. The Colored Mission  Sabbath School, established through the influence of Gen. Brown at the  Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church, is always an object of great  interest to the residents of the Capital, as well as to the hundreds of  strangers visiting the city.    In 1864 the receptions again commenced at the White House. For the first  two years of Mr. Lincoln's administration, the President selected a lady  to join in the promenade with him, which left Mrs. Lincoln free to  choose an escort from among the distinguished gentlemen that always  surrounded her on such occasions. This custom at last was discontinued  by Mrs. Lincoln.    \"Lizabeth!\"--I was sewing in her room, and she was seated in a  comfortable arm-chair--\"Lizabeth, I have been thinking over a little  matter. As you are well aware, the President, at every reception,  selects a lady to lead the promenade with him. Now it occurs to me that  this custom is an absurd one. On such occasions our guests recognize the  position of the President as first of all; consequently, he takes the  lead in everything; well, now, if they recognize his position they  should also recognize mine. I am his wife, and should lead with him. And  yet he offers his arm to any other lady in the room, making her first  with him and placing me second. The custom is an absurd one, and I mean  to abolish it. The dignity that I owe to my position, as Mrs. President,  demands that I should not hesitate any longer to act.\"    Mrs. Lincoln kept her word. Ever after this, she either led the  promenade with the President, or the President walked alone or with a  gentleman. The change was much remarked, but the reason why it was made,  I believe, was never generally known.    In 1864 much doubt existed in regard to the re-election of Mr. Lincoln,  and the White House was besieged by all grades of politicians. Mrs.  Lincoln was often blamed for having a certain class of men around her.    \"I have an object in view, Lizabeth,\" she said to me in reference to  this matter. \"In a political canvass it is policy to cultivate every  element of strength. These men have influence, and we require influence  to re-elect Mr. Lincoln. I will be clever to them until after the  election, and then, if we remain at the White House, I will drop every  one of them, and let them know very plainly that I only made tools of  them. They are an unprincipled set, and I don't mind a little  double-dealing with them.\"    \"Does Mr. Lincoln know what your purpose is?\" I asked.    \"God! no; he would never sanction such a proceeding, so I keep him in  the dark, and will tell him of it when all is over. He is too honest to  take the proper care of his own interests, so I feel it to be my duty to  electioneer for him.\"    Mr. Lincoln, as every one knows, was far from handsome. He was not  admired for his graceful figure and finely moulded face, but for the  nobility of his soul and the greatness of his heart. His wife was  different. He was wholly unselfish in every respect, and I believe that  he loved the mother of his children very tenderly. He asked nothing but  affection from her, but did not always receive it. When in one of her  wayward impulsive moods, she was apt to say and do things that wounded  him deeply. If he had not loved her, she would have been powerless to  cloud his thoughtful face, or gild it with a ray of sunshine as she  pleased. We are indifferent to those we do not love, and certainly the  President was not indifferent to his wife. She often wounded him in  unguarded moments, but calm reflection never failed to bring regret.    Mrs. Lincoln was extremely anxious that her husband should be re-elected  President of the United States. In endeavoring to make a display  becoming her exalted position, she had to incur many expenses. Mr.  Lincoln's salary was inadequate to meet them, and she was forced to run  in debt, hoping that good fortune would favor her, and enable her to  extricate herself from an embarrassing situation. She bought the most  expensive goods on credit, and in the summer of 1864 enormous unpaid  bills stared her in the face.    \"What do you think about the election, Lizabeth?\" she said to me one  morning.    \"I think that Mr. Lincoln will remain in the White House four years  longer,\" I replied, looking up from my work.    \"What makes you think so? Somehow I have learned to fear that he will be  defeated.\"    \"Because he has been tried, and has proved faithful to the best  interests of the country. The people of the North recognize in him an  honest man, and they are willing to confide in him, at least until the  war has been brought to a close. The Southern people made his election a  pretext for rebellion, and now to replace him by some one else, after  years of sanguinary war, would look too much like a surrender of the  North. So, Mr. Lincoln is certain to be re-elected. He represents a  principle, and to maintain this principle the loyal people of the loyal  States will vote for him, even if he had no merits to commend him.\"    \"Your view is a plausible one, Lizabeth, and your confidence gives me  new hope. If he should be defeated, I do not know what would become of  us all. To me, to him, there is more at stake in this election than he  dreams of.\"    \"What can you mean, Mrs. Lincoln? I do not comprehend.\"    \"Simply this. I have contracted large debts, of which he knows nothing,  and which he will be unable to pay if he is defeated.\"    \"What are your debts, Mrs. Lincoln?\"    \"They consist chiefly of store bills. I owe altogether about  twenty-seven thousand dollars; the principal portion at Stewart's, in  New York. You understand, Lizabeth, that Mr. Lincoln has but little idea  of the expense of a woman's wardrobe. He glances at my rich dresses, and  is happy in the belief that the few hundred dollars that I obtain from  him supply all my wants. I must dress in costly materials. The people  scrutinize every article that I wear with critical curiosity. The very  fact of having grown up in the West, subjects me to more searching  observation. To keep up appearances, I must have money--more than Mr.  Lincoln can spare for me. He is too honest to make a penny outside of  his salary; consequently I had, and still have, no alternative but to  run in debt.\"    \"And Mr. Lincoln does not even suspect how much you owe?\"    \"God, no!\"--this was a favorite expression of hers--\"and I would not  have him suspect. If he knew that his wife was involved to the extent  that she is, the knowledge would drive him mad. He is so sincere and  straightforward himself, that he is shocked by the duplicity of others.  He does not know a thing about any debts and I value his happiness, not  to speak of my own, too much to allow him to know anything. This is  what troubles me so much. If he is re-elected, I can keep him in  ignorance of my affairs; but if he is defeated, then the bills will be  sent in, and he will know all;\" and something like a hysterical sob  escaped her.    Mrs. Lincoln sometimes feared that the politicians would get hold of the  particulars of her debts, and use them in the Presidential campaign  against her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25"],[0,"The 1991 CIA World Factbook (#13)"],[1,"is in the tourist industry  (1986)      _#_Organized labor: Aruban Workers' Federation (FTA)      _*_Government  _#_Long-form name: none      _#_Type: part of the Dutch realm--full autonomy in internal affairs  obtained in 1986 upon separation from the Netherlands Antilles      _#_Capital: Oranjestad      _#_Administrative divisions: none (self-governing part of the  Netherlands)      _#_Independence: none (part of the Dutch realm); note--in 1990 Aruba  requested and received from the Netherlands cancellation of the  agreement to automatically give independence to the island in 1996      _#_Constitution: 1 January 1986      _#_Legal system: based on Dutch civil law system, with some English  common law influence      _#_National holiday: Flag Day, 18 March      _#_Executive branch: Dutch monarch, governor, prime minister, Council  of Ministers (cabinet)      _#_Legislative branch: unicameral legislature (Staten)      _#_Judicial branch: Joint High Court of Justice      _#_Leaders:    Chief of State--Queen BEATRIX Wilhelmina Armgard (since 30 April  1980), represented by Governor General Felipe B.
