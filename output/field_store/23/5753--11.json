A union of father and daughter, however, was perhaps not wholly  forbidden,[*] and that of brother and sister seems to have been regarded  as perfectly right and natural; the words brother and sister possessing  in Egyptian love-songs the same significance as lover and mistress with  us.         * E. de Rouge held that Rameses II. married at least two of       his daughters, Bint Anati and Honittui; Wiedemann admits       that Psammetichus I. had in the same way taken to wife       Nitocris, who had been born to him by the Theban princess       Shapenuapit. The Achaemenidan kings did the same: Artaxerxes       married two of his own daughters.    Paternity was necessarily doubtful in a community of this kind, and  hence the tie between fathers and children was slight; there being  no family, in the sense in which we understand the word, except as it  centred around the mother.    Maternal descent was, therefore, the only one openly acknowledged, and  the affiliation of the child was indicated by the name of the mother  alone. When the woman ceased to belong to all, and confined herself to  one husband, the man reserved to himself the privilege of taking as many  wives as he wished, or as he was able to keep, beginning with his own  sisters. All wives did not enjoy identical rights: those born of the  same parents as the man, or those of equal rank with himself, preserved  their independence. If the law pronounced him the master, _nibu_, to  whom they owed obedience and fidelity, they were mistresses of the  house, _nibit piru_, as well as wives, _himitu_, and the two words of  the title express their condition. Each of them occupied, in fact, her  own house, _piru_, which she had from her parents or her husband, and of  which she was absolute mistress, _nibit_. She lived in it and performed  in it without constraint all a woman's duties; feeding the fire,  grinding the corn, occupying herself in cooking and weaving, making  clothing and perfumes, nursing and teaching her children. When her  husband visited her, he was a guest whom she received on an equal  footing. It appears that at the outset these various wives were placed  under the authority of an older woman, whom they looked on as their  mother, and who defended their rights and interests against the master;  but this custom gradually disappeared, and in historic times we read  of it as existing only in the families of the gods. The female singers  consecrated to Amon and other deities, owed obedience to several  superiors, of whom the principal (generally the widow of a king or high  priest) was called _chief-superior of the ladies of the harem of Amon_.  Besides these wives, there were concubines, slaves purchased or born in  the house, prisoners of war, Egyptians of inferior class, who were the  chattels of the man and of whom he could dispose as he wished. All the  children of one father were legitimate, whether their mother were a wife  or merely a concubine, but they did not all enjoy the same advantages;  those among them who were born of a brother or sister united in  legitimate marriage, took precedence of those whose mother was a wife of  inferior rank or a slave. In the family thus constituted, the woman,  to all appearances, played the principal part. Children recognized the  parental relationship in the mother alone. The husband appears to have  entered the house of his wives, rather than the wives to have entered  his, and this appearance of inferiority was so marked that the Greeks  were deceived by it. They affirmed that the woman was supreme in Egypt;  the man at the time of marriage promised obedience to her and entered  into a contract not to raise any objection to her commands.    We had, therefore, good grounds for supposing that the first Egyptians  were semi-savages, like those still living in Africa and America, having  an analogous organization, and similar weapons and tools. A few lived  in the desert, in the oasis of Libya, or in the deep valleys of the Red  Land--Doshirit, To Doshiru--between the Nile and the sea; the poverty  of the country fostering their native savagery. Others, settled on  the Black Land, gradually became civilized, and we have found of late  considerable remains of those of their generations who, if not anterior  to the times of written records, were at least contemporary with the  earliest kings of the first historical dynasty.    [Illustration: 066.jpg NEGRO PRISONERS WEARING THE PANTHER'S SKIST AS A  LOIN-CLOTH.]    Their houses were like those of the fellahs of to-day, low huts of  wattle daubed with puddled clay, or of bricks dried in the sun. They  contained one room, either oblong or square, the door being the only  aperture. Those of the richer class only were large enough to make it  needful to support the roof by means of one or more trunks of trees,  which did duty for columns. Earthen pots, turned by hand, flint knives  and other implements, mats of reeds or plaited straw, two flat stones  for grinding corn, a few pieces of wooden furniture, stools, and  head-rests for use at night, comprised all the contents. Their ordinary  pottery is heavy and almost devoid of ornament, but some of the finer  kinds have been moulded and baked in wickerwork baskets, which have left  a quaint trellis-like impression on the surface of the clay. In many  cases the vases are bicolour, the body being of a fine smooth red,  polished with a stone, while the neck and base are of an intense black,  the surface of which is even more shining than that of the red part.  Sometimes they are ornamented with patterns in white of flowers,  palms, ostriches, gazelles, boats with undulated or broken lines, or  geometrical figures of a very simple nature. More often the ground is  coloured a fine yellow, and the decoration has been traced in red lines.  Jars, saucers, double vases, flat plates, large cups, supports for  amphorae, trays raised on a foot--in short, every kind of form is found  in use at that remote period. The men went about nearly naked, except  the nobles, who wore a panther's skin, sometimes thrown over the  shoulders, sometimes drawn round the waist, and covering the lower part  of the body, the animal's tail touching the heels behind, as we see  later in several representations of the negroes of the Upper Nile. They  smeared their limbs with grease or oil, and they tattooed their faces  and bodies, at least in part; but in later times this practice was  retained by the lower classes only. On the other hand, the custom of  painting the face was never given up. To complete their toilet, it was  necessary to accentuate the arch of the eyebrow with a line of kohl  (antimony powder). A similar black line surrounded and prolonged the  oval of the eye to the middle of the temple, a layer of green coloured  the under lid, and ochre and carmine enlivened the tints of the cheeks  and lips. The hair, plaited, curled, oiled, and plastered with grease,  formed an erection which was as complicated in the case of the man as in  that of the woman.

Should the hair be too short, a black or blue wig, dressed with much  skill, was substituted for it; ostrich feathers waved on the heads  of warriors, and a large lock, flattened behind the right ear,  distinguished the military or religious chiefs from their subordinates.  When the art of weaving became common, a belt and loin-cloth of white  linen replaced the leathern garment. Fastened round the waist, but so  low as to leave the navel uncovered, the loin-cloth frequently reached  to the knee; the hinder part was frequently drawn between the legs and  attached in front to the belt, thus forming a kind of drawers. Tails  of animals and wild beast's skin were henceforth only the insignia of  authority with which priests and princes adorned themselves on great  days and at religious ceremonies. The skin was sometimes carelessly  thrown over the left shoulder and swayed with the movement of the body;  sometimes it was carefully adjusted over one shoulder and under the  other, so as to bring the curve of the chest into prominence. The head  of the animal, skilfully prepared and enlivened by large eyes of enamel,  rested on the shoulder or fell just below the waist of the wearer; the  paws, with the claws attached, hung down over the thighs; the spots of  the skin were manipulated so as to form five-pointed stars. On going  out-of-doors, a large wrap was thrown over all; this covering was either  smooth or hairy, similar to that in which the Nubians and Abyssinians of  the present day envelop themselves. It could be draped in various  ways; transversely over the left shoulder like the fringed shawl of the  Chaldeans, or hanging straight from both shoulders like a mantle.[**]         ** This costume, to which Egyptologists have not given       sufficient attention, is frequently represented on the       monuments. Besides the two statues reproduced above, I may       cite those of Uahibri and of Thoth-nofir in the Louvre, and       the Lady Nofrit in the Gizeh Museum.

His name was  Sylvester Bonaffon, a retired merchant of Philadelphia. His elaborate  collections were sold at auction, and their oddity has attracted  general attention. His chief mania was for clocks, which literally  covered every portion of available space in his apartments, whether  they were placed on chairs, tables, shelves, or hung against the wall.  Some of these timepieces were of unique construction. One clock was  made to run for 400 days after one winding; another was set in the  dashboard of his carriage, and he used Mr. Bonaffon also had an  especial fondness for electrical apparatus. His windows were provided  with ingenious burglar alarms, his rooms with fire alarms, and he  ignited his gas always by electricity. His place of business, his  stable, the Continental Hotel where he dined, were all connected with  instruments in his room; and he even had perfected arrangements so  that he could set at home and send his own messages to California.  Besides the clocks and electric apparatus, there was an immense  collection of _bric-a-brac_ of every conceivable variety, which was  sold at the auction--as is usually the case--at prices much below  those paid by its late owner.           *       *       *       *       *          FERTILIZING INFLUENCE OF SNOW.      Snow is often called the \"poor man's manure;\" and if it is true that  it has any manurial value, the farmer's prospects for the next season  are certainly flattering. The body of snow upon the ground in all the  Northern and Middle States is very great, and millions of acres of  land are covered by it as with a blanket of the whitest wool. It is  probable that seldom, perhaps never, has so wide an area of our  country been covered as during this month of January, 1877. The  question whether snow is capable of affording to lands any of the  elements of fertility is one often asked; and in reply, the Boston  _Journal of Chemistry_ says that it probably is. The atmosphere holds  ammonia and some other nitrogenous products, which are without doubt  brought to the soil by snowflakes as well as by rain drops.  Experiments both here and abroad would seem to prove the truth of this  conclusion.    Rains are not only valuable for the moisture which they supply, but  for what they bring to us from the atmosphere. During a thunderstorm  nitric acid is produced in considerable quantities; and dissolved in  the rain drops to a high degree of attenuation, its effects upon soils  are highly salutary, as the nitrogen permeates the entire soil.           *       *       *       *       *      ACTION OF SEA WATER ON LEAD.    The _Journal of the Chemical Society_ says that freshly cut strips of  lead were kept in a bottle of sea water for four days, the bottle  being frequently shaken. No trace of lead could be detected in the  water, but the bright surface of the strips was coated with an  insoluble lead compound. Hence lead pipes may be used in marine  aquaria without any fear of injury to their inhabitants.           *       *       *       *       *          PAPIN'S STEAM ENGINE.    BY PROFESSOR CHARLES A. JOY.      It is a matter of history that, as early as 1688, Denis Papin,  Professor of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Marburg,  proposed to substitute steam for powder in the engine invented by  Huyghens, and that in 1695 he published a description of several new  inventions, in which steam played an important part. The Elector Carl,  of Hesse-Cassel, was anxious to be free from the annoyances and  impositions practised upon his boatmen by the authorities at Muenden,  and he proposed to avoid that city by constructing a canal connecting  the Weser with the river that flowed through Cassel. Much of the work  was accomplished, and the half finished line of the canal can be  traced even at the present day. Papin was authorized to build a  powerful steam pump by which the supply of water was to be regulated.  A working model of this pump was completed; and the Elector was on the  point of visiting the laboratory to witness its operation, when a  fearful explosion frightened the workmen, and afforded an opportunity  for enemies to intrigue for the expulsion of Papin from the country.  The model was preserved for a long time in Cassel; but at the time of  the French invasion, it disappeared, and no trace of it has since been  found. In writing about his inventions, Papin says, in 1695: \"It would  occupy too much space for me to describe in what manner this principle  could be applied to removing water from mines, throwing bombs, sailing  against the wind, and for many other similar purposes; everyone  according to his wants can imagine the constructions that could be  made. I cannot, however, refrain from remarking how much preferable  this power would be to oars for those whose business calls them to the  sea.\" And further on he says: \"The steam cylinders could be employed  for a great variety of purposes.\" One of the cylinders, which was to  form a part of the pump, was cast at the foundry in Cassel, and after  various vicissitudes has finally become the property of the Historical  Museum in that city, where it will be preserved, with jealous care,  from any further injury. During the recent exhibition of philosophical  instruments in London, this remnant of Papin's invention played an  important part, it having been generously loaned by the authorities  for that occasion. After the flight of Papin from Germany, the  cylinder was used as a receptacle for iron turnings and borings in the  royal works; and after the destruction of those works by fire, it came  into the possession of Henschel, the founder of one of the most  extensive locomotive works in Germany. This man fully appreciated the  value of the historical relic; and when I visited him at the works,  twenty-five years ago, he pointed out with pride to me the inscription  on its side, \"Papin's Cylinder,\" and said that he intended to have it  placed upon a solid pedestal near the gate. His grandson has since  presented it to the city, and its preservation from destruction or  sale is now secured. A copy of the drawing made by Papin of the pump  of which this cylinder was to form a part, and which was published in  1695, has recently appeared in Dingler's _Journal_, and I send it to  you, hoping that you will have it engraved and perpetuated in your  valuable paper. It is a peculiar combination of Savery's invention and  Papin's piston engine, suggested for another purpose, and is a decided  improvement on Huyghens' powder engine.    [Illustration: PAPIN'S STEAM ENGINE.]    A is the boiler for the generation of the steam, provided with a  safety valve (an invention of Papin). On opening the stopcock, C, the  steam passes through B into the cylinder, D, and by its expansion  drives the plunger, E, against the water contained in the cylinder, D,  which is thus forced into the chamber, F, compressing strongly the  air, which in turn expels the water through the pipe, G, to the height  desired. K is a funnel for the fresh supply of water, and at I and H  are valves opening upwards and downwards. After the condensation of  the steam in D, a renewed supply of water, through K, forces the  plunger, E, to the top of the cylinder, ready for the next action of  steam. The strokes of such a pump could not be frequent, and it would  not compare very favorably with the wonderful machinery exhibited in  Philadelphia last summer; but it contains the germ of the idea, and is  worthy of all honor. Having often seen it stated that Papin had  invented a steamboat, I resolved during a recent visit to Germany to  investigate the matter, and especially to search for the  correspondence between Papin and Leibnitz in the library at Hanover.  It will be borne in mind that two hundred years ago, on December 4,  1676, Leibnitz was appointed to take charge of the library in Hanover,  and that he remained in this position until his death in 1716. He  bequeathed his manuscripts to the library; and as he had the habit of  writing upon all manner of loose scraps of paper, it has cost much  labor to assort and classify them.    On making my application to the librarian to be permitted to see the  correspondence between Papin and Leibnitz, my request was at once  granted; and a table having been assigned me, I was able to examine  these precious relics at my leisure. I was also shown a copy of an  original treatise on the steam engine by Papin, which contained  numerous marginal notes by Leibnitz. In one place, Leibnitz criticized  Papin's method for condensing steam, and makes a drawing on the  margin, showing a piston and valve which he thought would be more  practical. It is somewhat remarkable that the Germans have not caused  a fac-simile of this little volume to be published. After considerable  search, I found a copy of the original letter addressed by Papin to  Leibnitz in 1707, asking Leibnitz to assist him in obtaining the  consent of the Hanoverian Government to navigate the river Weser with  a sidewheel steamboat. The letter was dated July 7, 1707, and  contained among other interesting passages the following sentence:  \"The new invention will enable one or two men to accomplish more  effect than several hundred oarsmen.\" It is evident that Leibnitz was  deeply impressed by Papin's letter, and he supported the simple and  reasonable request contained in it by the following petition addressed  to the Councillors of State. This communication from Leibnitz bears  two indorsements, one by the clerk of the council, \"_pro"]]]
