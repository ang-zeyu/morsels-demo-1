No. 164. HOW TO MAKE A WELSH RAREBIT.    First, make a round of hot toast, butter it, and cover it with thin  slices of cheese; put it before the fire until the cheese is melted,  then season with mustard, pepper, and salt, and eat the rarebit while  hot.      No. 165. EGG-HOT.    Put a pint of beer on the fire to warm, break an egg into a jug, add a  table-spoonful of sugar and some grated nutmeg or ginger; beat all  together with a fork for three minutes; then add a drop of the beer,  stir well together, and pour the remainder of the hot beer to this, and  continue pouring the egg-hot out of the warming-pot into the jug for two  minutes, when it will be well mixed and ready to drink.      No. 166. GINGER-POP.    Put a _very clean_ pot containing a gallon of water to boil on the fire,  and as soon as it begins to boil, add twelve ounces of brown sugar, and  one ounce of bruised ginger, and two ounces of cream of tartar; stir  well together; pour the whole into an earthen pan, cover it over with a  cloth, and let the mash remain in this state until it has become quite  cold; then stir in half a gill of fresh yeast; stir all well together  until thoroughly mixed, cover the pan over with a cloth, and leave the  ginger-beer in a cool place to work up; this will take from six to eight  hours; the scum which has risen to the top must then be carefully  removed with a spoon without disturbing the brightness of the beer; it  is then to be carefully poured off bright into a jug with a spout, to  enable you easily to pour it into the bottles. These must be immediately  corked down tight, tied across the corks with string, and put away,  lying down in the cellar. The ginger-pop will be fit to drink in about  four days after it has been bottled.      No. 167. PLUM BROTH.    Boil one quart of any kind of red plums in three pints of water with a  piece of cinnamon and four ounces of brown sugar until the plums are  entirely dissolved; then rub the whole through a sieve or colander, and  give it to the children to eat with bread.      No. 168. PLUM PORRIDGE, COLD.    Boil a quart of red plums in a pint of water, with a bit of cinnamon and  four ounces of sugar, until dissolved to a pulp; then rub the whole  through a sieve or colander into a large basin, and when this is quite  cold, mix in with it about a quart of good milk, and give it to the  children to eat with bread for either breakfast or supper.      No. 169. STEWED PRUNES OR PRUENS.    Purchase the cheaper kind of small prunes sold at 4_d._ per lb.; put  them into a saucepan with a pint of water, a bit of lemon-peel, and two  ounces of sugar, and allow them to simmer and stew very gently for about  half an hour, and then let them become nearly cold. Boil some rice in a  cloth, as directed in No. 92, and when done and turned out on its dish,  pour the prunes over it for the children's dinner. Once in a way, this  cheap and wholesome meal would prove a great treat.      No. 170. A SUMMER SALAD.    Rinse and well shake off all moisture from a couple of cos lettuce, cut  them up into a bowl or basin, add a few roughly-chopped green onions,  half a gill of cream, a table-spoonful of vinegar, pepper and salt to  taste. Mix all together.      No. 171. A BACON SALAD.    Having prepared any kind of salad you may happen to have, such as  endive, corn salad, lettuce, celery, mustard and cress, seasoned with  beet-root, onions, or shalot; let the salad be cut up into a bowl or  basin ready for seasoning in the following manner:--Cut eight ounces of  fat bacon into small square pieces the size of a cob-nut, fry these in a  frying-pan, and as soon as they are done, pour the whole upon the salad;  add two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, pepper and salt to taste. Mix  thoroughly.      No. 172. A PLAIN SALAD.    Cos lettuce cut up in a bowl or basin, seasoned with chopped green mint  and green onions, a spoonful of moist sugar, vinegar, pepper and salt.

Mix thoroughly.      No. 174. HOW TO MIX MUSTARD.    Put half an ounce of mustard into a tea-cup, or a small basin, add a  little salt; mix thoroughly with just enough boiling water to work the  whole into a smooth compact soft paste.          COOKERY AND DIET FOR THE SICK ROOM.      No. 175. BEEF TEA.    Chop up a pound of lean beef, and put it on to boil in a saucepan with a  quart of water, stirring it on the fire occasionally while it boils  rather fast, for at least half an hour; at the end of this time the beef  tea will have become reduced to a pint; season with salt to taste,  strain it through a clean bit of muslin or rag, and give a tea-cupful of  it with dry toast to the patient.      No. 176. MUTTON BROTH.    Chop a pound of scrag end of neck of mutton into small pieces, and put  it into a saucepan, with two ounces of barley, and rather better than a  quart of water; set the broth to boil gently on the fire, skim it well,  season with a little salt, thyme, parsley, and a couple of turnips; the  whole to continue gently boiling on the side of the hob for an hour and  a-half; at the end of this time serve some of the broth strained through  a clean rag into a basin; or, if the patient is allowed it, serve the  broth with some of the barley and pieces of the meat in it.      No. 177. CHICKEN BROTH.    Draw, singe, and cut a chicken into four quarters; wash these, put them  into a clean saucepan with a quart of water, and set the broth to boil  on the fire; skim it well, season with two ounces of sago, a small sprig  of thyme and parsley, and a little salt. Allow the broth to boil very  gently for an hour, and then serve some of it with the sago in a cup,  and, if allowed, give the patient the chicken separately.      No. 178. A CHEAPER KIND OF CHICKEN BROTH.    In large towns it is easy to purchase sixpenny-worth of fowls' necks,  gizzards, and feet, which, prepared as indicated in the foregoing  Number, make excellent broth at a fourth part of the cost occasioned by  using a fowl for the same purpose.      No. 179. VEAL AND RICE BROTH.    Cut up one pound and a-half of knuckle of veal, and put it on to boil in  a saucepan with a quart of water, four ounces of rice, a small sprig of  thyme, and a little parsley; season with a few peppercorns and a little  salt; boil very gently for two hours.      No. 180. MEAT PANADA FOR INVALIDS AND INFANTS.    First, roast whatever kind of meat is intended to be made into panada,  and, while it is yet hot, chop up all the lean thereof as fine as  possible, and put this with all the gravy that has run from the meat on  the plate into a small saucepan with an equal quantity of crumb of bread  previously soaked in hot water; season with a little salt (and, if  allowed, pepper), stir all together on the fire for ten minutes, and  give it in small quantities at a time. This kind of meat panada is well  adapted as a nutritious and easily-digested kind of food for old people  who have lost the power of mastication, and also for very young  children.      No. 181.

Arrow-root is to be prepared exactly after the directions given for the  preparation of sago and tapioca.      No. 183. HOW TO MAKE GRUEL.    Mix a table-spoonful of Robinson's prepared groats or grits with a  tea-cupful of cold water, pour this into a saucepan containing a pint of  hot water, and stir it on the fire while it boils for ten minutes;  strain the gruel through a sieve or colander into a basin, sweeten to  taste, add a spoonful of any kind of spirits, or else season the gruel  with salt and a bit of butter.      No. 184. BROWN AND POLSON GRUEL.    Brown and Polson's excellent preparation of Indian corn is to be  purchased of all grocers throughout the kingdom. Mix a dessert-spoonful  of the prepared Indian corn with a wine-glassful of cold water, and pour  this into a small saucepan containing half a pint of hot water; stir on  the fire for ten minutes, sweeten with moist sugar, flavour with nutmeg  or a spoonful of spirits.      No. 185. GRUEL MADE WITH OATMEAL.    In the absence of groats, oatmeal furnishes the means of making  excellent gruel. Mix two table-spoonfuls of oatmeal with a gill of cold  water; pour this into a saucepan containing a pint of hot water, stir  the gruel on the fire while it boils very gently for about a quarter of  an hour, then sweeten with moist sugar, or, if preferred, the gruel may  be eaten with a little salt and a bit of butter.

There are two hotels in Teheran and several European and Armenian  restaurants. The English hotel is the best,--not a dream of cleanliness,  nor luxury, nor boasting of a cuisine which would remain impressed upon  one's mind, except for its elaborate monotony,--but quite a comfortable  place by comparison with the other European hotels of Persia. The beds  are clean, and the proprietress tries hard to make people comfortable.    More interesting than the hotel itself was the curious crowd of people  whom one saw at the dinner-table. I remember sitting down one evening to  dinner with nine other people, and we represented no less than ten  different nationalities! The tower of Babel sank almost into  insignificance compared with the variety of languages one heard spoken  all round, and one's polyglot abilities were tested to no mean extent in  trying to carry on a general conversation. One pleasant feature of these  dinners was the amount of talent and good-humour that prevailed in the  company, and the absolute lack of distinction of class or social  position. Side by side one saw a distinguished diplomat conversing with  the Shah's automobile driver, and a noteworthy English member of  Parliament on friendly terms with an Irish gentleman of the Indo-European  Telegraphs. A burly, jolly Dutchman stood drinks all round to members of  the Russian and English Banks alike, and a French _sage-femme_ just  arrived discussed her prospects with the hotel proprietress. The Shah's  A.D.C. and favourite music-composer and pianist came frequently to  enliven the evenings with some really magnificent playing, and by way of  diversion some wild Belgian employees of the derelict sugar-factory used  almost nightly to cover with insults a notable \"Chevalier d'industrie\"  whose thick skin was amazing.    Then one met Armenians--who one was told had come out of jail,--and  curio-dealers, mine prospectors, and foreign Generals of the Persian  army.    Occasionally there was extra excitement when an engagement or a wedding  took place, when the parties usually adjourned to the hotel, and then  there was unlimited consumption of beer, nominally (glycerine really,  for, let me explain, beer does not stand a hot climate unless a large  percentage of glycerine is added to it), and of highly-explosive  champagne and French wines, Chateau this and Chateau that--of Caspian  origin.    Being almost a teetotaller myself, this mixed crowd--but not the mixed  drink--was interesting to study, and what particularly struck me was the  _bonhomie_, the real good-heartedness, and manly but thoughtful, genial  friendliness of men towards one another, irrespective of class, position  or condition, except, of course, in the cases of people with whom it was  not possible to associate. The hard, mean, almost brutal jealousy, spite,  the petty rancour of the usual Anglo-Indian man, for instance, does not  exist at all in Persia among foreigners or English people. On the  contrary, it is impossible to find more hospitable, more gentlemanly,  polite, open-minded folks than the Britishers one meets in Persia.    Of course, it must be remembered, the type of Britisher one finds in  Persia is a specially talented, enterprising and well-to-do individual,  whose ideas have been greatly broadened by the study of several foreign  languages which, in many cases, have taken him on the Continent for  several years in his youth. Furthermore, lacking entirely the ruling  \"look down upon the native\" idea, so prevalent in India, he is thrown  much in contact with the Persians, adopting from them the courteous  manner and form of speech, which is certainly more pleasant than the  absurd rudeness of the \"keep-aloof\" notion which generally makes us hated  by most Orientals.    The Britisher in Persia, with few exceptions, is a charming person,  simple and unaffected, and ready to be of service if he can. He is not  aggressive, and, in fact, surprisingly suave.    This abnormal feature in the British character is partly due to the  climate, hot but very healthy, and to the exile to which the Briton has  to reconcile himself for years to come. Indeed, Persia is an exile, a  painful one for a bachelor, particularly. Woman's society, which at all  times helps to make life sweet and pleasant, is absolutely lacking in  Persia. European women are scarce and mostly married or about to get  married. The native women are kept in strict seclusion. One never sees a  native woman except heavily veiled under her _chudder_, much less can a  European talk to her. The laws of Persia are so severe that anything in  the shape of a flirtation with a Persian lady may cost the life of Juliet  or Romeo, or both, and if life is spared, blackmail is ever after levied  by the police or by the girl's parents or by servants.    In Teheran all good citizens must be indoors by nine o'clock at night,  and any one found prowling in the streets after that hour has to deal  with the police. In the European quarter this rule is overlooked in the  case of foreigners, but in the native city even Europeans found  peacefully walking about later than that hour are taken into custody and  conveyed before the magistrate, who satisfies himself as to the man's  identity and has him duly escorted home.    There are no permanent amusements of any kind in Teheran. An occasional  concert or a dance, but no theatres, no music-halls. There is a  comfortable Club, where people meet and drink and play cards, but that is  all.    Social sets, of course, exist in the Teheran foreign community. There are  \"The Telegraph\" set, \"the Bank,\" \"the Legations.\" There is an uncommon  deal of social etiquette, and people are most particular regarding calls,  dress, and the number of cards left at each door. It looks somewhat  incongruous to see men in their black frock-coats and silk tall hats,  prowling about the streets, with mud up to their knees if wet, or blinded  with dust if dry, among strings of camels, mules, or donkeys. But that is  the fashion, and people have to abide by it.    There are missionaries in Teheran, American and English, but fortunately  they are not permitted to make converts. The English, Russian and Belgian  communities are the most numerous, then the French, the Dutch, the  Austrian, the Italian, the American.    Taking things all round, the Europeans seem reconciled to their position  in Teheran--a life devoid of any very great excitement, and partaking  rather of the nature of vegetation, yet with a certain charm in it--they  say--when once people get accustomed to it. But one has to get accustomed  to it first.    The usual servant question is a very serious one in Teheran, and is one  of the chief troubles that Europeans have to contend with. There are  Armenian and Persian servants, and there is little to choose between the  two. Servants accustomed to European ways are usually a bad lot, and most  unreliable; but in all fairness it must be admitted that, to a great  extent, these servants have been utterly spoilt by Europeans themselves,  who did not know how to deal with them in a suitable manner. I repeatedly  noticed in Teheran and other parts of Persia that people who really  understood the Persian character, and treated subordinates with  consideration, had most excellent servants--to my mind, the most  intelligent and hard-working in the world--and spoke very highly of  them.

A description of Teheran is hardly necessary here, the city being so  well-known, but for the help of people unfamiliar with its character a  rough sketch of the place may be given.    Teheran, it must be remembered, has only been the capital of Persia for  the last hundred years, when the capital was removed from Isfahan.  Previous to that it was merely a royal resort and nothing more. In shape  it was formerly almost circular--or, to be strictly accurate, polygonal,  the periphery of the polygon measuring a _farsakh_, four miles. Like all  Persian cities it was enclosed in a mud wall and a moat. Since then the  city has so increased that an extension has been made to an outer  boundary some ten miles in circumference, and marked by an uneven ditch,  the excavated sand of which is thrown up to form a sort of battlement.  Twelve gates, opened at sunrise and closed at night, give access to the  town. The citadel, the ancient part of the city, contains the principal  public buildings, the private residences of high officials, and the  Shah's Palace. To the south of this are found the extensive domed bazaars  and the commercial portion of Teheran. To the north lies the European  quarter with the Legations, Banks and European shops.    We will not go as far back as the Afghan invasion in 1728 when, according  to history, Teheran was looted and razed to the ground by the Afghans,  but we will only mention the fact, which is more interesting to us, that  it was not till about 1788 that the city was selected on account of its  geographical position and of political necessities, as the seat of the  Kajar dynasty by Agha Mohammed, who in 1796 became the first King of his  family. The Kajar, as everybody knows, has remained the reigning dynasty  of Persia to this day.    The most interesting point of Teheran, in the very centre of the city, is  the old \"Place du Canon,\" where on a high platform is a gigantic piece of  ordnance enclosed by a railing. In the same square is a large reservoir  of more or less limpid water, in which at all hours of the day dozens of  people are to be seen bathing. But the big gun attracts one's attention  principally. A curious custom, which is slowly being"]]]
