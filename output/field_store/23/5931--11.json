[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#13)"],[1,"Abraham Lincoln was no loafer. He always found something useful and  helpful to do. This time there was a local election, and one of the  clerks had not appeared to perform his duties. A New Salem woman wrote  of Lincoln's first act in the village:    \"My father, Mentor Graham, was on that day, as usual, appointed to be a  clerk, and Mr. McNamee, who was to be the other, was sick and failed to  come. They were looking around for a man to fill his place when my  father noticed Mr. Lincoln and asked if he could write. He answered that  he could 'make a few rabbit tracks.'\"      PILOTING A FAMILY FLATBOAT    A few days after the election the young stranger, who had become known  by this time as the hero of the flatboat on Rutledge's dam four months  before, found employment as a pilot. A citizen, Dr. Nelson, was about to  emigrate to Texas. The easiest and best mode of travel in those days  was by flatboat down the river. He had loaded all his household goods  and movable property on his \"private conveyance\" and was looking about  for a \"driver.\" Young Lincoln, still waiting, unemployed, offered his  services and took the Nelson family down the Sangamon River--a more  difficult task in August than in April, when the water was high on  account of the spring rains. But the young pilot proceeded cautiously  down the shallow stream, and reached Beardstown, on the Illinois River,  where he was \"discharged\" and walked back over the hills to New Salem.      ANNOYED BY THE HIGH PRAISES OF HIS EMPLOYER    Denton Offutt and his stock for the store arrived at last, and Lincoln  soon had a little store opened for business. A country store seemed too  small for a clerk of such astounding abilities, so the too enthusiastic  employer bought Cameron's mill with the dam on which Lincoln had already  distinguished himself, and made the clerk manager of the whole business.    This was not enough. Offutt sounded the praises of the new clerk to all  comers. He claimed that Abraham Lincoln \"knew more than any man in the  United States.\" As Mr. Offutt had never shown that he knew enough  himself to prove this statement, the neighbors began to resent such rash  claims. In addition, Offutt boasted that Abe could \"beat the county\"  running, jumping and wrestling. Here was something the new clerk could  prove, if true, so his employer's statement was promptly challenged.    When a strange man came to the village to live, even though no one  boasted of his prowess, he was likely to suffer at the hands of the  rougher element of the place. It was a sort of rude initiation into  their society. These ceremonies were conducted with a savage sense of  humor by a gang of rowdies known as the \"Clary's Grove Boys,\" of whom  the \"best fighter\" was Jack Armstrong.    Sometimes \"the Boys\" nailed up a stranger in a hogshead and it was  rolled down hill. Sometimes he was ingeniously insulted, or made to  fight in self-defense, and beaten black and blue by the whole gang. They  seemed not to be hampered by delicate notions of fair play in their  actions toward a stranger. They \"picked on him,\" as chickens, dogs and  wolves do upon a newcomer among them.    So when young Lincoln heard his employer bragging about his brain and  brawn he was sufficiently acquainted with backwoods nature to know that  it boded no good to him. Even then \"he knew how to bide his time,\" and  turned it to good account, for he had a good chance, shortly to show the  metal that was in him.    \"The Boys\" called and began to banter with the long-legged clerk in the  new store. This led to a challenge and comparison of strength and  prowess between young Lincoln and Jack Armstrong. Abe accepted the  gauntlet with an alacrity that pleased the crowd, especially the chief  of the bully \"Boys,\" who expected an easy victory. But Jack was  surprised to find that the stranger was his match--yes, more than his  match. Others of \"the Boys\" saw this, also, and began to interfere by  tripping Abe and trying to help their champion by unfair means.    This made young Lincoln angry. Putting forth all his strength, he seized  Armstrong by the throat and \"nearly choked the exuberant life out of  him.\" When \"the Boys\" saw the stranger shaking their \"best fighter\" as  if he were a mere child, their enmity gave place to admiration; and when  Abe had thrown Jack Armstrong upon the ground, in his wrath, as a lion  would throw a dog that had been set upon him, and while the strong  stranger stood there, with his back to the wall, challenging the whole  gang, with deep-set eyes blazing with indignation, they acknowledged him  as their conqueror, and declared that \"Abe Lincoln is the cleverest  fellow that ever broke into the settlement.\"    The initiation was over, and young Lincoln's triumph complete. From that  day \"the Clary's Grove Boys\" were his staunch supporters and defenders,  and his employer was allowed to go on bragging about his wonderful clerk  without hindrance.      GIVING ANOTHER BULLY \"A DOSE OF SMARTWEED\"    A bumptious stranger came into the store one day and tried to pick a  quarrel with the tall clerk. To this end he used language offensive to  several women who were there trading. Lincoln quietly asked the fellow  to desist as there were \"ladies present.\" The bully considered this an  admission that the clerk was afraid of him, so he began to swear and use  more offensive language than before. As this was too much for Abraham's  patience, he whispered to the fellow that if he would keep quiet till  the ladies went out, he (Lincoln) would go and \"have it out.\"    After the women went, the man became violently abusive. Young Lincoln  calmly went outside with him, saying: \"I see you must be whipped and I  suppose I will have to do it.\" With this he seized the insolent fellow  and made short work of him. Throwing the man on the ground, Lincoln sat  on him, and, with his long arms, gathered a handful of \"smartweed\" which  grew around them. He then rubbed it into the bully's eyes until he  roared with pain. An observer of this incident said afterward:    \"Lincoln did all this without a particle of anger, and when the job was  finished he went immediately for water, washed his victim's face and did  everything he could to alleviate the man's distress. The upshot of the  matter was that the fellow became his life-long friend, and was a better  man from that day.\"      HOW HE MADE HIS FELLOW CLERK GIVE UP GAMBLING    Lincoln's morals were unusually good for that time and place. Smoking,  chewing, drinking, swearing and gambling were almost universal among  his associates. Offutt hired a young man, William G. Greene, after the  purchase of the mill. This assistant first told many of the stories, now  so well known, concerning Abe at this period of his career:    Young Greene was, like most of the young men in New Salem, addicted to  petty gambling. He once related how Lincoln induced him to quit the  habit. Abe said to him one day:    \"Billy, you ought to stop gambling with Estep.\" Billy made a lame  excuse:    \"I'm ninety cents behind, and I can't quit until I win it back.\"    \"I'll help you get that back,\" urged Lincoln, \"if you'll promise me you  won't gamble any more.\"    The youth reflected a moment and made the required promise. Lincoln  continued:    \"Here are some good hats, and you need a new one. Now, when Estep comes  again, you draw him on by degrees, and finally bet him one of these hats  that I can lift a forty-gallon barrel of whisky and take a drink out of  the bunghole.\"    Billy agreed, and the two clerks chuckled as they fixed the barrel so  that the bunghole would come in the right place to win the bet, though  the thing seemed impossible to Greene himself. Estep appeared in due  time, and after long parleying and bantering the wager was laid. Lincoln  then squatted before the barrel, lifted one end up on one knee, then  raised the other end on to the other knee, bent over, and by a Herculean  effort, actually succeeded in taking a drink from the bunghole--though  he spat it out immediately. \"That was the only time,\" said Greene long  afterward, \"that I ever saw Abraham Lincoln take a drink of liquor of  any kind.\" This was the more remarkable, as whisky was served on all  occasions--even passed around with refreshments at religious meetings,  according to Mrs. Josiah Crawford, the woman for whom Abe and Nancy had  worked as hired help. Much as Abe disapproved of drinking, he considered  that \"the end justified the means\" employed to break his fellow clerk of  the gambling habit.      HOW HE WON THE NAME OF \"HONEST ABE\"    Abe Lincoln could not endure the thought of cheating any one, even  though it had been done unintentionally. One day a woman bought a bill  of goods in Offutt's store amounting to something over two dollars. She  paid Abe the money and went away satisfied. That night, on going over  the sales of the day, Abe found that he had charged the woman six and  one-fourth cents too much. After closing the store, though it was late,  he could not go home to supper or to bed till he had restored that  sixpence to its proper owner. She lived more than two miles away, but  that did not matter to Abe Lincoln. When he had returned the money to  the astonished woman he walked back to the village with a long step and  a light heart, content with doing his duty.    Another evening, as he was closing the store, a woman came in for a  half-pound of tea. He weighed it out for her and took the pay. But early  next morning, when he came to \"open up,\" he found the four-ounce weight  instead of the eight-ounce on the scales, and inferred that he had given  that woman only half as much tea as he had taken the money for. Of  course, the woman would never know the difference, and it meant walking  several miles and back, but the honest clerk weighed out another quarter  pound of tea, locked the store and took that long walk before breakfast.  As a \"constitutional\" it must have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#13)"],[1,"descend to its mouth  in Kotzebue Sound; the whole distance being about five hundred miles  through a very little travelled country. We learned indeed, that it had  been travelled but once this winter, and that on the first snow. It was  thought at Bettles that we might possibly procure some supplies at a  newly established mission of the Society of Friends about half-way down  the Kobuk River, but there was no certainty about it, and we must carry  with us enough man-food to take us to salt water. Our supply of dog fish  we might safely count upon replenishing from the natives on the Kobuk.  Another thing that caused some thought was the supply of small money.  There was no silver and no currency except large bills on the Koyukuk,  and we should need money in small sums to buy fish with. So the agent  weighed out a number of little packets of gold-dust carefully sealed up  in stout writing-paper like medicine powders, some worth a dollar, some  worth two dollars, the value written on the face, and we found them  readily accepted by the natives and very convenient. Two years later I  heard of some of those packets, unbroken, still current on the Kobuk.    At last, on the 26th of January, we got away. The thermometer stood only  a few degrees above -50 deg. when we left, but the barometer had been  falling slowly for a couple of days, and I was convinced the cold spell  was over. With our three teams and four men we made quite a little  expedition, but dogs and men were alike soft, and for the first two days  the travel was laborious and slow; then came milder weather and better  going.    [Sidenote: THE KOYUKUK \"TOWNS\" OF '98]    We passed the two ruined huts of Peavey, the roofs crushed by the  superincumbent snow. In the summer of 1898 a part of the stream of gold  seekers, headed for the Klondike by way of Saint Michael, was deflected  to the Koyukuk River by reports of recent discoveries there. A great  many little steamboat outfits made their way up this river late in the  season, until their excessive draught in the falling water brought them  to a stand. Where they stopped they wintered, building cabins and  starting \"towns.\" In one or two cases the \"towns\" were electrically lit  from the steamboat's dynamo. The next summer they all left, all save  those who were wrecked by the ice, and the \"towns\" were abandoned. But  they had got upon the map through some enterprising representative of  the land office, and they figure on some recent maps still. Peavey,  Seaforth, Jimtown, Arctic City, Beaver City, Bergman, are all just names  and nothing else, though at Bergman the Commercial Company had a plant  for a while.    We passed the mouth of the Alatna, where were two or three Indian  cabins, and went on the remaining ten miles to Moses' Village, where the  body of the man frozen to death had been brought. Moses' Village, named  from the chief, was the largest native village on the Koyukuk River, and  we were glad, despite our haste, that we had gone there. The repeated  requests from all the Indians we met for a mission and school on the  Koyukuk River and the neglected condition of the people had moved me the  previous year to take up the matter. This was my first visit, however,  so far down the river.    We found the coffin unmade and the grave undug, and set men vigorously  to work at both. The frozen body had been found fallen forward on hands  and feet, and since to straighten it would be impossible without  several days' thawing in a cabin, the coffin had to be of the size and  shape of a packing-case; of course the ground for the grave had to be  thawed down, for so are all graves dug in Alaska, and that is a slow  business. A fire is kindled on the ground, and when it has burned out,  as much ground as it has thawed is dug, and then another fire is  kindled. We had our own gruesome task. The body should be examined to  make legally sure that death came from natural causes. With difficulty  the clothes were stripped from the poor marble corpse, my companion made  the examination, and as a notary public I swore him to a report for the  nearest United States commissioner. This would furnish legal proof of  death were it ever required; otherwise, since there is no provision for  the travelling expenses of coroners, and the nearest was one hundred and  forty or one hundred and fifty miles away, there would have been no  inquest and no such proof.    [Sidenote: A WILDERNESS TRAGEDY]    The man had delayed his return to Bettles too long. When his food was  exhausted and he had to go, there came on that terrible cold spell. A  little memorandum-book in his pocket told the pitiful story. Day by day  he lingered hoping for a change, and day by day there was entry of the  awful cold. He had no thermometer, but he knew the temperature was -50 deg.  or lower by the cracking noise that his breath made--the old-timer's  test. At last the grub was all gone and he must go or starve. The final  entry read: \"All aboard to-morrow, hope to God I get there.\" The Indians  estimated that he had been walking two days, and had \"siwashed it\" at  night somewhere beside a fire in the open without bedding. Holes were  burned in his breeches in two places, where, doubtless, he had got too  near the fire. He had nothing whatever to eat with him save a piece of  bacon gnawed to the rind. There were only two matches in his pocket, and  they were mixed up with trash of birch-bark and tobacco, so it is likely  he did not know he had them. He had lit all the fires he could light and  eaten all the food he had to eat. Still he was plugging along towards  the native village nine miles away. Then he lost the trail, probably in  the dark, for it was faint and much drifted, and had taken off his  snow-shoes to feel with his moccasined feet for the hardened snow that  would indicate it. That was almost the end. He had gone across the river  and back again, feeling for the trail, and then, with the deadly  numbness already upon his brain, had wandered in a circle. The date of  his starting in the memorandum-book and the distance travelled made it  almost certain that, at some moment between the time when those three  moons floated in the sky and the time when that cross glared on the  horizon, he had fallen in the snow, never to rise again. Fifty-eight  below zero and a wind blowing!    One supposes that the actual death by freezing is painless, as it is  certainly slow and gradual. The only instance of sudden gelation I ever  heard of is in Longfellow's \"Wreck of the Hesperus,\" where the skipper,  having answered one question, upon being asked another,            \"Answered never a word,           For a frozen corpse was he.\"    But if the actual death be painless, the long conscious fight against it  must be an agony; for a man of any experience must realise the peril he  is in. The tingling in fingers and toes and then in knees and elbows is  a warning he recognises only too well. He knows that, unless he can  restore warmth by restoring the circulation, he is as good as frozen  already. He increases his pace and beats his arms against his breast.  But if his vitality be too much reduced by hunger and fatigue and cold  to make more than a slight response to the stimulation, if the distance  to warmth and shelter be too great for a spurt to carry him there, he is  soon in worse case than before. Then the appalling prospect of perishing  by the cold must rise nakedly before him. The enemy is in the breach,  swarming over the ramparts, advancing to the heart of the fortress, not  to be again repelled. He becomes aware that his hands and feet are  already frozen, and presently there may be a momentary terrible  recognition that his wits begin to wander. Frantically he stumbles on,  thrashing his body with his arms, forcing his gait to the uttermost, a  prey to the terror that hangs over him, until his growing horror and  despair are mercifully swallowed up in the somnolent torpidity that  overwhelms him. All of us who have travelled in cold weather know how  uneasy and apprehensive a man becomes when the fingers grow obstinately  cold and he realises that he is not succeeding in getting them warm  again. It is the beginning of death by freezing.    We buried the body on a bench of the bluff across the river from the  native village, the natives all standing around reverently while the  words of committal were said, and set up a cross marked with  lead-pencil: \"R. I. P.--Eric Ericson, found frozen, January, 1906.\" Two  or three years later a friend sent me a small bronze tablet with the  same legend, and that was affixed to the cross. There are many such  lonely graves in Alaska, for scarce a winter passes that does not claim  its victims in every section of the country. That same winter we heard  of two men frozen on the Seward Peninsula, two on the Yukon, one on the  Tanana, and one on the Valdez trail. This day I recorded a temperature  of 10 deg., the first plus temperature in thirty-nine days, and that  previous rise above zero was the first in twenty days.    [Sidenote: NEGLECTED NATIVES]    That night we gathered all the natives, and after long speech with poor  interpretation I ventured to promise them a mission the next year. Some  of them had been across to the Yukon years before and had visited the  mission at Tanana. Some had been baptized there. Some had never seen a  clergyman or missionary of any sort before, and had never heard the  gospel preached. We were touched by one old blind woman who told of a  visit to a mission on the Yukon, and how she learned to sing a hymn  there. Her son interpreted: \"She say every night she sing that hymn for  speak to God.\" She was encouraged to sing it, and it turned out to be  the alphabet set to a tune! After much pleading and with some  hesitation, I baptized seventeen children, comforting myself with the  assurance of the coming mission, which would undertake their Christian  training"]]]
