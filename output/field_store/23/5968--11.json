If the  dog finds nothing he comes back to his master in a short time, and says  in his dumb way, \"No coon there.\" But if he strikes a trail you  presently hear a louder rattling on the stone wall, and then a hurried  bark as he enters the woods, succeeded in a few minutes by loud and  repeated barkings as he reaches the foot of the tree in which the coon  has taken refuge. Then follows a pellmell rush as the cooning party dash  up the hill, into the woods, through the brush and the darkness, falling  over prostrate trees, pitching into gullies and hollows, losing hats and  tearing clothes, till finally, guided by the baying of the faithful dog,  they reach the tree. The first thing now in order is to kindle a fire,  and, if its light reveals the coon, to shoot him; if not, to fell the  tree with an axe, unless this last expedient happens to be too great a  sacrifice of timber and of strength, in which case it is necessary to  sit down at the foot of the tree and wait till morning.    [Illustration: RACCOON]          XI    THE PORCUPINE      Among our wild animals there are three that are slow-moving,  dull-witted, and almost fearless,--the skunk, the opossum, and the  porcupine. The two latter seem to be increasing in most parts of the  country. The opossum is becoming quite common in the valley of the  Hudson, and the porcupine is frequently met with in parts of the country  where it was rarely or never seen forty years ago.    When the boys in late fall now go cooning where I used to go cooning in  my youth, the dogs often run on a porcupine or drive him up a tree, and  thus the sport is interrupted. Sometimes the dog comes to them with his  mouth stuck full of quills, and is then compelled to submit to the  painful operation of having them withdrawn.    A sportsman relates that he once came upon a dead porcupine and a dead  bald eagle lying upon the ground within a few yards of each other. The  eagle had partly torn the porcupine to pieces, but in attacking it with  its beak it had driven numerous spines of the animal into its throat,  and from their effect had apparently died as soon as its victim.    The quill of a porcupine is like a bad habit: if it once gets hold it  constantly works deeper and deeper, though the quill has no power of  motion in itself; it is the live, active flesh of its victim that draws  it in by means of the barbed point. One day my boy and I encountered a  porcupine on the top of one of the Catskills, and we had a little circus  with him; we wanted to wake him up, and make him show a little  excitement, if possible. Without violence or injury to him, we succeeded  to the extent of making his eyes fairly stand out from his head, but  quicken his motion he would not,--probably could not.    What astonished and alarmed him seemed to be that his quills had no  effect upon his enemies; they laughed at his weapons. He stuck his head  under a rock and left his back and tail exposed. This is the porcupine's  favorite position of defense. \"Now come if you dare,\" he seems to say.  Touch his tail, and like a trap it springs up and strikes your hand full  of little quills. The tail is the active weapon of defense; with this  the animal strikes. It is the outpost that delivers its fire before the  citadel is reached. It is doubtless this fact that has given rise to the  popular notion that the porcupine can shoot its quills, which of course  it cannot do.    With a rotten stick we sprang the animal's tail again and again, till  its supply of quills began to run low, and the creature grew uneasy.  \"What does this mean?\" he seemed to say, his excitement rising. His  shield upon his back, too, we trifled with, and when we finally drew him  forth with a forked stick, his eyes were ready to burst from his head.  In what a peevish, injured tone the creature did complain of our unfair  tactics! He protested and protested, and whimpered and scolded, like  some infirm old man tormented by boys. His game after we led him forth  was to keep himself as much as possible in the shape of a ball, but with  two sticks and a cord we finally threw him over on his back and exposed  his quill-less and vulnerable under side, when he fairly surrendered and  seemed to say, \"Now you may do with me as you like.\" Then we laughed in  his face and went our way.    Before we had reached our camp I was suddenly seized with a strange,  acute pain in one of my feet. It seemed as if a large nerve was being  roughly sawed in two. I could not take another step. Sitting down and  removing my shoe and stocking, I searched for the cause of the  paralyzing pain. The foot was free from mark or injury, but what was  that little thorn or fang of thistle doing on the ankle? I pulled it out  and found it to be one of the lesser quills of the porcupine. By some  means, during our \"circus,\" the quill had dropped inside my stocking,  the thing had \"taken,\" and the porcupine had his revenge for all the  indignities we had put upon him. I was well punished. The nerve which  the quill struck had unpleasant memories of it for many months  afterward.    When you come suddenly upon the porcupine in his native haunts, he draws  his head back and down, puts up his shield, trails his broad tail, and  waddles slowly away. His shield is the sheaf of larger quills upon his  back, which he opens and spreads out in a circular form so that the  whole body is quite hidden beneath it. The porcupine's great chisel-like  teeth, which are quite as formidable as those of the woodchuck, he does  not appear to use at all in his defense, but relies entirely upon his  quills, and when those fail him he is done for.    I once passed a summer night alone upon the highest peak of the  Catskills, Slide Mountain. I soon found there were numerous porcupines  that desired to keep me company. The news of my arrival in the  afternoon seemed to have spread rapidly among them. They probably had  scented me. After resting awhile I set out to look up the spring, and  met a porcupine on his way toward my camp. He turned out in the grass,  and then, as I paused, came back into the path and passed directly over  my feet. He evidently felt that he had as good a right to the road as I  had; he had traveled it many times before me. When I charged upon him  with a stick in my hand, he slowly climbed a small balsam fir.    [Illustration: PORCUPINE]    I soon found the place of the spring, and, having dredged it and cleaned  it, I sat down upon a rock and waited for the water slowly to seep in.  Presently I heard something in the near bushes, and in a moment a large  porcupine came into view. I thought that he, too, was looking for water;  but no, he was evidently on his way to my camp. He, also, had heard the  latest rumor on the mountain-top. It was highly amusing to watch his  movements. He came teetering along in the most aimless, idiotic way. Now  he drifted off a little to the right, then a little to the left; his  blunt nose seemed vaguely to be feeling the air; he fumbled over the  ground, tossed about by loose boulders and little hillocks; his eyes  wandered stupidly about; I was in plain view within four or five yards  of him, but he heeded me not. Then he turned back a few paces, but some  slight obstacle in his way caused him to change his mind. One thought of  a sleep-walker; uncertainty was stamped upon every gesture and movement;  yet he was really drifting towards camp. After a while he struck the  well-defined trail, and his gray, shapeless body slowly disappeared up  the slope. In five or six minutes I overtook him shuffling along within  sight of the big rock upon which rested my blanket and lunch. As I came  up to him he depressed his tail, put up his shield, and slowly pushed  off into the wild grass. While I was at lunch I heard a sound, and there  he was, looking up at me from the path a few feet away. \"An uninvited  guest,\" I said; \"but come on.\" He hesitated, and then turned aside into  the bracken; he would wait till I had finished and had gone to sleep, or  had moved off.    How much less wit have such animals,--animals like the porcupine,  opossum, skunk, turtle,--that nature has armed against all foes, than  the animals that have no such ready-made defenses, and are preyed upon  by a multitude of enemies! The price paid for being shielded against all  danger, for never feeling fear or anxiety, is stupidity. If the  porcupine were as vulnerable to its enemies as, say, the woodchuck, it  would probably soon come to be as alert and swift of foot as that  marmot.    For an hour or more, that afternoon on the mountain top, my attention  was attracted by a peculiar continuous sound that seemed to come from  far away to the east. I queried with myself, \"Is it the sound of some  workman in a distant valley hidden by the mountains, or is its source  nearer by me on the mountain side?\" I could not determine. It was not a  hammering or a grating or the filing of a saw, though it suggested such  sounds. It had a vague, distant, ventriloquial character. In the  solitude of the mountain top there was something welcome and pleasing in  it. Finally I set out to try to solve the mystery. I had not gone fifty  yards from camp when I knew I was near the source of the sound.  Presently I saw a porcupine on a log, and as I approached the sound  ceased, and the animal moved away. A curious kind of chant he made, or  note of wonder and surprise at my presence on the mountain,--or was he  calling together the clan for a midnight raid upon my camp?    I made my bed that night of ferns and balsam boughs under an overhanging  rock, where the storm that swept across the mountain just after dark  could not reach me. I lay down, rolled in my blankets, with a long staff  by my side, in anticipation of visits from the porcupines. In the middle  of the night I was awakened, and, looking out of my den, saw a porcupine  outlined against the "]]]
