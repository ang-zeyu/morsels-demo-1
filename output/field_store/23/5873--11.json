(2) The patient may  develop an enormous appetite--what we call bulimia--eating several  times as much as she does ordinarily. (3) She may develop an aversion  towards certain articles of food. Thus many women develop an aversion  towards meat, the mere sight of or talk about meat causing in them a  sensation of nausea. (4) She may show a craving for the most peculiar  articles of food and for articles which are not food at all. The  craving for sour pickles or sour cabbage is well-known; but some women  will eat chalk, sand, and even more peculiar things (for the chalk  there may be a reason: the system needs an extra amount of lime and  chalk is carbonate of lime).    =Constipation.= Constipation is very common among women in the  non-pregnant condition; but in the pregnant it is much more common and  much more aggravated. Constipation must be guarded against, but the  measures must be of a mild nature. If we can relieve the constipation  by dietary measures alone, so much the better. The dietary measures  should consist in eating plenty of fruit--prunes, apples, figs, dates,  etc., and coarse bread and bran. Constipating articles, such as cheese  or coffee, should be eliminated. Where dietary measures alone are  insufficient, the patient should take an enema--a rectal  injection--twice or three times a week. The enema should consist of  about 8 ounces (half a pint) of cold or lukewarm water containing a  pinch of salt, and should be retained about ten minutes. Instead of  water, we may advise an occasional enema of two to four drams of  glycerin. Or instead of a glycerin enema, a glycerin suppository may  be used. If internal laxatives are to be used, only the mildest and  non-griping preparations should be employed The best are: a good  mineral oil--one or two tablespoonfuls on going to bed, or fluid  extract of cascara sagrada, one-half to one teaspoonful on going to  bed. It is very important, whatever we use, _not_ to use the same  thing for a long time. If the same drug or measure is used without any  change, the bowels get used to it and cease to respond and we have to  use larger and larger doses. In fighting constipation we must  therefore constantly change our weapons: one night we use mineral oil,  the next night cascara sagrada, the third night an enema, the fourth  night a glycerin injection or suppository, the fifth night perhaps  nothing at all, the sixth night a blue mass pill, the seventh morning  a Seidlitz powder, then a rest for a day or two, then a repetition of  the same measures. But always remember: first try to get along without  any drugs at all. Many cases can get relieved of their constipation by  a proper change in diet alone. And where this is impossible, then use  mild laxatives and use them interchangeably.    =Toothache= is not uncommon in pregnancy, and a pregnant woman should  have her teeth put in first-class condition.    =Difficulty in Urination.= Pregnant women often suffer with frequency  and urgency of urination. Some have to urinate, while they are on  their feet, every few minutes. This is due to the fact that during  the first two or three months of pregnancy the uterus is not only  enlarged but is also _anteverted_, that is _turned forward_ and  _presses down_ upon the bladder. When the woman is lying down the  pressure on the bladder is relieved, and she does not have to urinate  frequently. This pressure lasts only the first two or three months,  because after that the growing womb lifts itself out of the pelvis,  rising into the abdominal cavity; it is no longer anteverted and the  pressure on the bladder is relieved. During the last months of the  pregnancy there is again frequent urination, because then the heavy  uterus sinks again into the pelvic cavity and presses upon the  bladder. The treatment for this frequent urination consists in wearing  a well fitting abdominal belt or corset, which raises the uterus and  prevents pressure on the bladder. Sometimes a pessary which prevents  the anteversion is efficient. In all cases lying down and resting is  useful. In short, keeping off one's feet is the most efficient remedy  for the treatment of frequent urination in pregnant women.    =Hemorrhoids= (Piles). On account of the pressure of the womb on the  rectum, and also on account of the constipation which is so frequent  during pregnancy, hemorrhoids or piles are quite frequent among  pregnant women. The treatment of hemorrhoids consists in removing the  cause: wearing a well-fitting abdominal belt, and relieving the  constipation. Injecting into the rectum about half a pint of cold  water three times a day is very useful. For the intolerable itching  sometimes present in hemorrhoids the following ointment will be found  very grateful: menthol, 5 grains; calomel, 10 grains; bismuth  subnitrate, 30 grains; resorcin, 10 grains; oil of cade, 15 grains;  cold cream, one ounce. The piles (the hemorrhoids) are to be well  cleansed with hot water, and this ointment is to be well smeared over;  a little is pushed into the rectum, and a piece of cotton is put over  the anus. This protects the clothes from soiling and keeps the  medicine in place for a longer time. Instead of ointment a cocoa  butter suppository may be used. A suppository of the following  composition is good: powdered nutgalls, 3 grains; oil of cade, 3  drops; resorcin, 1 grain; bismuth subnitrate, 5 grains; cocoa butter,  20 grains. One such suppository to be inserted three times a day. The  ointment and the suppository given above, if used in conjunction with  the proper regulation of the bowels, will not only relieve but will  cure most cases of hemorrhoids caused by pregnancy.    =Itching of the Vulva. Pruritus Vulvae.= Itching of the external  genitals during pregnancy is not uncommon. This may be due to the  fact that the vulva is generally congested and swollen during  pregnancy or it may be caused by an increased leucorrheal discharge.  The itching is sometimes very severe, and if the patient scratches  with her nails and produces bleeding, she may cause an infection of  the parts. The patient should be cautioned against scratching; she  should try simple measures to relieve the itching. A small towel or  gauze compress wrung out of boiling water and applied to the vulva  several times a day, followed by a free application of stearate of  zinc powder is often efficient. If it is not, the following salve may  be tried: carbolic acid, 10 grains; menthol, 5 grains; resorcin, 15  grains; zinc oxide, 1 dram; and white vaseline, one ounce. In very  severe cases the vulva should be painted with a solution of silver  nitrate, 25 grains to 1 ounce of distilled water.    =Varicose Veins.= In most women during pregnancy the veins in the legs  become somewhat enlarged. This is due to the pressure of the womb,  which interferes with the circulation. If the veins become very  prominent, swollen and tortuous, they are called varicose. This  condition should be prevented, because it often and to some degree  always persists permanently even after the pregnancy is over. The best  precautionary measure is for the woman to wear a well-fitting  abdominal belt or maternity corset, which supports the womb and does  not permit it to sink too low into the pelvis. If varicose veins have  been permitted to develop, the woman should wear well-fitting rubber  stockings, or at least have the legs bandaged with woven elastic  bandages. The bandage must be applied by a competent person, uniformly  and not too tightly. Constipation has also a bad effect in making  varicose veins worse; the bowels should therefore also be looked  after. In some severe cases all measures are of little value unless  the patient at the same time stays in bed or on a couch for a few  days, with the legs elevated.    Swelling of the feet should be at once attended to. It may be a  trifling matter due only to pressure of the womb; then again it may be  due to some kidney trouble. The physician will determine the true  cause and prescribe the appropriate treatment.    =Liver Spots. Chloasma.= In some cases irregular brownish patches or  splotches develop on the skin around the breasts, on the sides, or on  the face. These patches are known popularly as liver spots or in  medical language as _chloasma_. Nothing can be done for them, but they  generally disappear after the pregnancy is over. A few patches here  and there may remain permanently.          CHAPTER TWELVE    WHEN TO ENGAGE A PHYSICIAN     Necessity for the Pregnant Woman Immediately Placing Herself Under    Care of Physician and Remaining Under His Care During Entire    Period.      The disorders and disturbances described above are, with the exception  of pernicious vomiting, of a minor nature. They are annoying, may  cause considerable discomfort and suffering, but they do not endanger  the life of the woman or of the child. Occasionally, however,  fortunately not very often, the kidneys become affected, and for this  condition treatment by a physician is absolutely necessary. In fact,  the correct and safe thing for a woman to do is to consult a physician  as soon as she knows she is pregnant, and have him take care of her  during the entire pregnancy. Some women engage a physician during the  eighth or ninth month and this is decidedly wrong, because it may then  be too late to correct certain troubles which if taken at the outset  could have been easily cured; while many troubles in the hands of a  competent physician can be prevented altogether. I must therefore  reiterate: every woman should engage a physician from the beginning  of her pregnancy, or at least during the third or fourth and certainly  not later than the fifth month. He will examine the urine every month  and make sure that the kidneys are in order, he will make sure that  the child is in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21880"],[0,"The Medallic History of the United States of America 1776-1876 (#13)"],[1,"           XL   (p. lix)      [_Victories of Chippewa, Niagara, and Erie._]      Description of Medal........................................ 203    Biographical Sketch of Jacob Brown.......................... 203    Resolutions of Congress Voting Medals to Generals Brown,      Scott, Porter, Gaines, Macomb, Ripley and      Miller................................
