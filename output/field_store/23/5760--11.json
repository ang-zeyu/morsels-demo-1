Laura Bridgman, too, a person in general  the subject of very incorrect inferences, who was not blind and deaf  from birth, could form a small number of concepts that were above the  lowest grade. These originated from the materials furnished by the sense  of touch, the muscular sense and general sensibility, before she had  learned a sort of finger-language. But she had learned to speak somewhat  before she became dumb and blind. Children with sight, born deaf, seem  not to be able to perform the simplest arithmetical operations, e. g.,  214-96 and 908 X 70 (according to Asch, 1865), until after several years  of continuous instruction in articulate speaking. They do succeed,  however, and that without sound-images of words, and perhaps, too,  without sight-images of words; in mental arithmetic without knowledge of  written figures, by help of the touch-images of words which the tongue  furnishes.    In any case uneducated persons born deaf can count by means of the  fingers without the knowledge of figures; and, when they go beyond 10,  the notched stick comes to their aid (Sicard and Degerando).    The language of gesture and feature in very young children, born dumb  and not treated differently from other children, shows also, in most  abundant measure, that concepts are formed without words. The child born  deaf uses the primitive language of gesture to the same extent as does  the child that has his hearing; the former makes himself intelligible by  actions and sounds as the latter does, so that his deficiency is not  suspected. This natural language is also _understood_ by the child born  deaf, so far as it is recognizable by his eye. In the look and the  features of his mother he reads her mood. But he very early becomes  quiet and develops for himself, \"out of unconscious gesticulation, the  gesture language, which at first is not conventional, nay, is not in the  strict sense quite a sign-language, but a mimetic-plastic representation  of the influences experienced from the external world,\" since the  deaf-mute imitates movements perceived, and the attitude of persons and  the position of objects. Upon this pantomime alone rests the possibility  of coming to an understanding, within a certain range, with deaf-mutes  that have had no instruction at all. It can not, therefore, in its  elementary form be conventional, as Hill, to whom I owe these data,  rightly maintains. He writes concerning the child born deaf: \"His voice  seems just like that of other children. He screams, weeps, according as  he feels uncomfortable; he starts when frightened by any noise. Even  friendly address, toying, fun, serious threats, are understood by him as  early as by any child.\" But he does not hear his own voice; it is not  sound that frightens him, but the concussion; it is not the pleasant  word that delights him, but the pleasant countenance of his mother. \"It  even happens, not seldom, that through encouragement to use the voice,  these children acquire a series of articulate sounds, and a number of  combinations of sounds, which they employ as the expression of their  wishes.\" They not only _point out_ the object desired, not only  _imitate_ movements that are to procure what they want, but they also  outline the forms of objects wished for. They are able to conduct  themselves so intelligently in this, that the deaf-mute condition is not  discovered till the second year, or even later, and then chiefly by  their use of the eye, because in case of distant objects only those seen  excite their attention.    From this behavior of infants born deaf it manifestly follows that even  without the possibility of natural imitation of sounds, and without the  knowledge of a single word, qualities may be blended with qualities into  concepts. Thus, _primitive thinking is not bound up with verbal  language_. It demands, however, a certain development of the cerebrum,  probably a certain very considerable number of ganglionic cells in the  cerebral cortex, that stand in firm organic connection with one another.  The difference between an uninstructed young deaf-mute and a cretin is  immense. The former can learn a great deal through instruction in  speaking, the latter can not. This very ability to learn, in the child  born deaf, is greater than in the normal child, in respect to pantomime  and gesture. If a child with his hearing had to grow up among  deaf-mutes, he would undoubtedly learn their language, and would in  addition enjoy his own voice without being able to make use of it; but  he would probably be discovered, further on, without testing his  hearing, by the fact that he was not quite so complete a master of this  gesture-language as the deaf-mutes, on account of the diversion of his  attention by sound.    The total result of the foregoing observations concerning the capacity  of accomplishment on the part of uneducated deaf-mutes in regard to the  natural language of gesture and feature, demonstrates more plainly than  any other fact whatever that, without words and without signs for words,  thought-activity exists--that thinking takes place when both words and  signs for words are wanting. Wherefore, then, should the logical  combination of ideas in the human being born perfect begin only with the  speaking of words or the learning to speak? Because the adult supposes  that he no longer thinks without words, he easily draws the erroneous  conclusion that no one, that not even he himself, could think before the  knowledge of verbal language. In truth, however, it was _not language  that generated the intellect; it is the intellect that formerly invented  language: and even now the new-born human being brings with him into the  world far more intellect than talent for language_.    FOOTNOTES:    [C] Empfindungsvorstellungen.          CHAPTER XVII.    LEARNING TO SPEAK.      No human being remembers how he learned his mother-tongue in early  youth, and the whole human race has forgotten the origin of its  articulate speech as well as of its gestures; but every individual  passes perceptibly through the stage of learning to speak, so that a  patient observer recognizes much as conformable to law.    The acquisition of speech belongs to those physiological problems which  can not be solved by the most important means possessed by physiology,  vivisection. And the speechless condition in which every human being is  born can not be regarded as a disease that may be healed by instruction,  as is the case with certain forms of acquired aphasia. A set of other  accomplishments, such as swimming, riding, fencing, piano-playing, the  acquirement of which is physiological, are learned like articulate  speech, and nobody calls the person that can not swim an anomaly on that  account. The _inability to appropriate_ to one's self these and other  co-ordinated muscular movements, this alone is abnormal. But we can not  tell in advance in the case of any new-born child whether he will learn  to speak or not, just as in the case of one who has suffered an  obstruction of speech or has entirely lost speech, it is not certain  whether he will ever recover it.    In this the normal child that does _not yet_ speak perfectly,  resembles the diseased adult who, for any cause, _no longer_ has  command of language. And to compare these two with each other is the  more important, as at present no other empirical way is open to us for  investigating the nature of the process of learning to speak; but this  way conducts us, fortunately, through pathology, to solid, important  physiological conclusions.    1. Disturbances of Speech in Adults.    The command of language comprises, on the one hand, the understanding of  what is spoken; on the other hand, the utterance of what is thought. It  is at the height of its performance in free, intelligible, connected  speech. Everything that disturbs the _understanding of words heard_ must  be designated disturbance of speech equally with everything that  disturbs _the production of words_ and sentences.    By means of excellent investigations made by many persons, especially by  Broca, Wernicke, Kussmaul, it has become possible to make a topical  division of most of the observed disturbances of speech of both kinds.  In the first class, which comprises the _impressive_ processes, we have  to consider every functional disturbance of the peripheral ear, of the  auditory nerve and of the central ends of the auditory nerve; in the  second class, viz., the _expressive_ processes, we consider every  functional disturbance of the apparatus required for articulation,  including the nerves belonging to this in their whole extent, in  particular the hypoglossus, as motor nerve of the tongue, and certain  parts of the cerebral hemispheres from which the nerves of speech are  excited and to which the sense-impressions from without are so conducted  by connecting fibers that they themselves or their memory-images can  call forth expressive, i. e., motor processes. The diagram, Fig. 1,  illustrates the matter.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The peripheral ear _o_, with the terminations of the auditory nerve, is  by means of sensory fibers _a_, that are connected with the auditory  nerve, in connection with the storehouse of sound-impressions, K. This  is connected by means of the intercentral paths _v_ with the motor  speech-center M. From it go out special fibers of communication, _h_, to  the motor nerves of speech which terminate in the external instruments  of articulation, _z_.    The impressive nerve-path, _o_ _a_ K, is centripetal; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19550"],[0,"Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon (#13)"],[1,"over which many naturalists have argued; it is  synonymous with _Macacus speciosus_, _M. maurus_, _M. melanotus_,  and was thought to be with _M. brunneus_ till Dr. Anderson placed  the latter in a separate species on account of the non-annulation  of its hair. It is essentially a denizen of the hills; it has been  obtained in Cachar and in Upper Assam. Dr. Anderson got it in the  Kakhyen Hills on the frontier of Yunnan, beyond which, he says, it  spreads to the southeast to Cochin-China.      NO. 23. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS THIBETANUS.  _The Thibetan Stump-tailed Monkey_.    DESCRIPTION.--Head large and whiskered; form robust; tail stumpy and  clad; general colour of the animal brown; whiskers greyish; face nude  and flesh-coloured, with a deep crimson flush round the eyes.    SIZE.--Two feet 9 inches; tail about 3 inches.    This large monkey, though not belonging to British India, inhabiting,  it is said, \"the coldest and least accessible forests of Eastern  Thibet,\" is mentioned here, as the exploration of that country by  travellers from India is attracting attention.      _GENUS MACACUS_.    Tail longer than in _Inuus_, and face not so lengthened; otherwise  as in that genus.--_Jerdon_.      NO. 24. MACACUS RADIATUS.  _The Madras Monkey_ (_Jerdon's No. 9_).    NATIVE NAMES.--_Bandar_, Hindi; _Makadu_ or _Wanur_, Mahratti;  _Kerda mahr_ of the Ghats; _Munga_, Canarese; _Koti_, Telegu; _Vella  munthi_, Malabar.    HABITAT.--All over the southern parts of India, as far north as lat.  18 degrees.    [Figure: _Macacus radiatus_ and _Macacus pileatus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Of a dusky olive brown, paler and whitish underneath,  ashy on outer sides of limbs; tail dusky brown above, whitish  beneath; hairs on the crown of the head radiated.    SIZE.--Twenty inches; tail 15 inches.    Elliott remarks of this monkey that it inhabits not only the wildest  jungles, but the most populous towns, and it is noted for its audacity  in stealing fruit and grain from shops. Jerdon says: \"It is the monkey  most commonly found in menageries, and led about to show various  tricks and feats of agility. It is certainly the most inquisitive  and mischievous of its tribe, and its powers of mimicry are surpassed  by none.\" It may be taught to turn a wheel regularly; it smokes  tobacco without inconvenience.--_Horsfield_.      NO. 25. MACACUS PILEATUS (_vel_ SINICUS, _Lin_.).  _The Capped Monkey_, or _Bonneted Macaque_ of _Cuvier_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Rilawa_, Singhalese.    HABITAT.--Ceylon and China.    DESCRIPTION.--Yellowish brown, with a slight shade of green in old  specimens; in some the back is light chestnut brown; yellowish brown  hairs on the crown of the head, radiating from the centre to the  circumference; face flesh-coloured and beardless; ears, palms,  soles, fingers, and toes blackish; irides reddish brown; callosities  flesh-coloured; tail longish, terminating in short tuft.--_Kellaart_.    SIZE.--Head and body about 20 inches; tail 18 inches.    This is the _Macacus sinicus_ of Cuvier, and is very similar to the  last species. In Ceylon it takes the place of our rhesus monkey with  the conjurors, who, according to Sir Emerson Tennent, \"teach it to  dance, and in their wanderings carry it from village to village, clad  in a grotesque dress, to exhibit its lively performances.\" It also,  like the last, smokes tobacco; and one that belonged to the captain  of a tug steamer, in which I once went down from Calcutta to the  Sandheads, not only smoked, but chewed tobacco. Kellaart says of it:  \"This monkey is a lively, spirited animal, but easily tamed;  particularly fond of making grimaces, with which it invariably  welcomes its master and friends. It is truly astonishing to see the  large quantity of food it will cram down its cheek pouches for future  mastication.\"      NO. 26. MACACUS CYNOMOLGUS.  _The Crab-eating Macaque_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Kra_, Malay.    HABITAT.--Tenasserim, Nicobars, Malay Archipelago.    [Figure: _Macacus cynomolgus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--\"The leading features of this animal are its massive  form, its large head closely set on the shoulders, its stout and  rather short legs, its slender loins and heavy buttocks, its tail  thick at the base\" (Anderson). The general colour is similar to that  of the Bengal rhesus monkey, but the skin of the chest and belly is  bluish, the face livid, with a white area between the eyes and white  eyelids. Hands and feet blackish.    SIZE.--About that of the Bengal rhesus.    According to Captain (now Sir Arthur) Phayre \"these monkeys frequent  the banks of salt-water creeks and devour shell-fish. In the  cheek-pouch of the female were found the claws and body of a crab.  There is not much on record concerning the habits of this monkey in  its wild state beyond what is stated concerning its partiality for  crabs, which can also, I believe, be said of the rhesus in the Bengal  Sunderbunds.\"      NO. 27. MACACUS CARBONARIUS.  _The Black-faced Crab-eating Monkey_.    HABITAT.--Burmah.    DESCRIPTION.--In all respects the same as the last, except that its  face is blackish, with conspicuously white eyelids.      FAMILY LEMURIDAE.    The Indian members of this family belong to the sub-family named by  Geoffroy _Nycticebinae_.      _GENUS NYCTICEBUS_.      NO. 28. NYCTICEBUS TARDIGRADUS.  _The Slow-paced Lemur_ (_Jerdon's No. 10_).    NATIVE NAME.--_Sharmindi billi_, Hindi.    HABITAT.--Eastern Bengal, Assam, Garo Hills, Sylhet,  Arracan.--_Horsfield_.    [Figure: _Loris gracilis_ and _Nycticebus tardigradus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Dark ashy grey, with a darker band down middle of back,  beneath lighter grey; forehead in some dark, with a narrow white  stripe between the eyes, disappearing above them; ears and round the  eye dark; tail very short.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Length about 14 to 15 inches; tail 5/8 of an inch.    Nocturnal in its habits; sleeping during the day in holes of trees,  and coming out to feed at night. Sir William Jones describes one kept  by him for some time; it appeared to have been gentle, though at times  petulant when disturbed; susceptible of cold; slept from sunrise to  sunset rolled up like a hedgehog. Its food was chiefly plantains,  and mangoes when in season. Peaches, mulberries, and guavas, it did  not so much care for, but it was most eager after grasshoppers, which  it devoured voraciously. It was very particular in the performance  of its toilet, cleaning and licking its fur. Cuvier also notices this  last peculiarity, and with regard to its diet says it eats small birds  as well as insects. These animals are occasionally to be bought in  the Calcutta market. A friend of mine had a pair which were a source  of great amusement to his guests after dinner. (See Appendix C, p.526.)      _GENUS LORIS_.    Body and limbs slender; no tail; eyes very large, almost contiguous;  nose acute.      NO. 29. LORIS GRACILIS.  _The Slender Lemur_ (_Jerdon's No. 11_).    NATIVE NAMES.--_Tevangar_, Tamil; _Dewantsipilli_, Telegu. (_Oona  happslava_, Singhalese.--_Kellaart_.)    HABITAT.--Southern India and Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--Above greyish rufescent (tawny snuff brown:  Kellaart); beneath a paler shade; a white triangular spot on forehead,  extending down the nose; fur short, dense, and soft; ears thin,  rounded (Jerdon). A hooped claw on inner toes; nails of other toes  flat; posterior third of palms and soles hairy (Kellaart).    SIZE.--About 8 inches; arm, 5; leg, 5-1/2.    This, like the last, is also nocturnal in its habits, and from the  extreme slowness of its movements is called in Ceylon \"the Ceylon  sloth.\" Its diet is varied--fruit, flower, and leaf buds, insects,  eggs, and young birds. Sir Emerson Tennent says the Singhalese assert  that it has been known to strangle pea-fowl at night and feast on  the brain, but this I doubt. Smaller birds it might overcome. Jerdon  states that in confinement it will eat boiled rice, plantains, honey  or syrup and raw meat. McMaster, at page 6 of his 'Notes on Jerdon,'  gives an interesting extract from an old account of 'Dr. John Fryer's  Voyage to East India and Bombain,' in which he describes this little  animal as \"Men of the Woods, or more truly Satyrs;\" asleep during  the day; but at \"Night they Sport and Eat.\" \"They had Heads like an  owl. Bodied like a monkey without Tails. Only the first finger of  the Right Hand was armed with a claw like a bird, otherwise they had  hands and feet which they walk upright on, not pronely, as other  Beasts do.\"    These little creatures double themselves up when they sleep, bending  the head down between their legs. Although so sluggish generally,  Jerdon says they can move with considerable agility when they choose.      SUB-ORDER PLEUROPTERA.--FAMILY GALAEOPITHECIDAE.    There is a curious link between the Lemurs and the Bats in the Colugos.  (_Galaeopithecus_): their limbs are connected with a membrane as in  the Flying Squirrels, by which they can leap and float for a hundred  yards on an inclined plane. They are mild, inoffensive animals,  subsisting on fruits and leaves. Cuvier places them after the Bats,  but they seem properly to link the Lemurs and the frugivorous Bats.  As yet they have not been found in India proper, but are common in  the Malayan Peninsula, and have been found in Burmah.      NO. 30. GALAEOPITHECUS VOLANS.  _The Flying Lemur_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Myook-hloung-pyan_, Burmese.    HABITAT.--Mergui; the Malayan Peninsula.    [Figure: _Galaeopithecus volans_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Fur olive brown, mottled with irregular whitish spots  and blotches; the pile is short, but exquisitely soft; head and brain  very small; tail long and prehensile. The membrane is continued from  each side of the neck to the fore feet; thence to the hind feet, again  to the tip of the tail. This animal is also nocturnal in its habits,  and very sluggish in its motions by day, at which time it usually  hangs from a branch suspended by its fore hands, its mottled back  assimilating"]]]
