Some of these rolls of the Book of the Dead are very beautifully  written, and illustrated with most wonderful little coloured pictures,  representing different scenes of life in the other world, and it is from  these that we have learned a great deal of what the Egyptians believed  about the judgment after death, and heaven. But the common ones are very  carelessly done. The scribes knew that the book was going to be buried  at once, and that nobody was likely ever to see it again; so they did  not care much whether they made mistakes or not, and often they missed  out parts of the book altogether. They little thought that, thousands of  years after they were dead, scholars would dig up their writings again,  and read them, and see all their blunders.    Of course, a great deal of this book is dreadful rubbish, and anything  more unlike the noble and beautiful teaching of the Bible you can  scarcely imagine. It has no more sense in it than the \"Fee! fi! foh!  fum!\" of our fairy-stories. Here is one little chapter from it. It is  called \"The Chapter of Repulsing Serpents,\" and the Egyptians supposed  that when a serpent attacked you on your way to heaven, you had only to  recite this verse, and the serpent would be powerless to harm you:  \"Hail, thou serpent Rerek! advance not hither. Stand still now, and thou  shalt eat the rat which is an abomination unto Ra (the Sun-God), and  thou shalt crunch the bones of a filthy cat.\"    It sounds very silly, doesn't it? And there are many things quite as  silly as this in the book. You can scarcely imagine how wise people like  the Egyptians could ever have believed in such drivel. But, then, side  by side with this miserable stuff, you find really wonderful and noble  thoughts, that surely came to these men of ancient days from God  Himself, telling them how every man must be judged at last for all that  he has done on earth, and how only those who have done justly, and loved  mercy, and walked humbly with God, will be accepted by Him.          CHAPTER XII    TEMPLES AND TOMBS      Anyone travelling through our own land, or through any European country,  to see the great buildings of long ago, would find that they were nearly  all either churches or castles. There are the great cathedrals, very  beautiful and wonderful; and there are the great buildings, sometimes  partly palaces and partly fortresses, where Kings and nobles lived in  bygone days. Well, if you were travelling in Egypt to see its great  buildings, you would find a difference. There are plenty of churches,  or temples, rather, and very wonderful they are; but there are no  castles or palaces left, or, at least, there are next to none. Instead  of palaces and castles, you would find tombs. Egypt, in fact, is a land  of great temples and great tombs.    [Illustration: Plate 14  GATEWAY OF THE TEMPLE OF EDFU. _Pages_ 74, 75]    Now, one can see why the Egyptians built great temples; for they were a  very religious nation, and paid great honour to their gods. But why did  they give so much attention to their tombs? The reason is, as you will  hear more fully in another chapter, that there never was a nation which  believed so firmly as did the Egyptians that the life after death was  far more important than life in this world. They built their houses, and  even their palaces, very lightly, partly of wood and partly of clay,  because they knew that they were only to live in them for a few years.  But they called their tombs \"eternal dwelling-places\"; and they have  made them so wonderfully that they have lasted long after all the other  buildings of the land, except the temples, have passed away.    First of all, let me try to give you an idea of what an Egyptian temple  must have been like in the days of its splendour. People come from all  parts of the world to see even the ruins of these buildings, and they  are altogether the most astonishing buildings in the world; but they are  now only the skeletons of what the temples once were, and scarcely give  you any more idea of their former glory and beauty than a human skeleton  does of the beauty of a living man or woman. Suppose, then, that we are  coming up to the gates of a great Egyptian temple in the days when it  was still the house of a god who was worshipped by hundreds of thousands  of people.    As we pass out of the narrow streets of the city to which the temple  belongs, we find ourselves standing upon a broad paved way, which  stretches before us for hundreds of yards. On either side, this way is  bordered by a row of statues, and these statues are in the form of what  we call sphinxes--that is to say, they have bodies shaped like crouching  lions, and on the lion-body there is set the head of a different  creature. Some of the sphinxes, like the Great Sphinx, have human heads;  but those which border the temple avenues have oftener either ram or  jackal heads.    As we pass along the avenue, two high towers rise before us, and between  them is a great gateway. In front of the gate-towers are two tall  obelisks, slender, tapering shafts of red granite, like Cleopatra's  Needle on the Thames Embankment. They are hewn out of single blocks of  stone, carved all over with hieroglyphic figures, polished till they  shine like mirrors, and their pointed tops are gilded so that they flash  brilliantly in the sunlight. Beside the obelisks, which may be from 70  to 100 feet high, there are huge statues, perhaps two, perhaps four, of  the King who built the temple. These statues represent the King as  sitting upon his throne, with the double crown of Egypt, red and white,  upon his head. They also are hewn out of single blocks of stone, and  when you look at the huge figures you wonder how human hands could ever  get such stones out of the quarry, sculpture them, and set them up.  Before one of the temples of Thebes still lie the broken fragments of a  statue of Ramses II. When it was whole the statue must have been about  57 feet high, and the great block of granite must have weighed about  1,000 tons--the largest single stone that was ever handled by human  beings. Plate 10 will give you some idea of what these huge statues  looked like.    Fastened to the towers are four tall flagstaves--two on either side of  the gate--and from them float gaily-coloured pennons. The walls of the  towers are covered with pictures of the wars of the King. Here you see  him charging in his chariot upon his fleeing enemies; here, again, he is  seizing a group of captives by the hair, and raising his mace or his  sword to kill them; but whatever he is doing, he is always gigantic,  while his foes are mere helpless human beings. All these carvings are  brilliantly painted, and the whole front of the building glows with  colour; it is really a kind of pictorial history of the King's reign.    Now we stand in front of the gate. Its two leaves are made of cedar-wood  brought from Lebanon; but you cannot see the wood at all, for it is  overlaid with plates of silver chased with beautiful designs. Passing  through the gateway, we find ourselves in a broad open court. All round  it runs a kind of cloister, whose roof is supported upon tall pillars,  their capitals carved to represent the curving leaves of the palm-tree.  In the middle of the court there stands a tall pillar of stone,  inscribed with the story of the great deeds of Pharaoh, and his gifts to  the god of the temple. It is inlaid with turquoise, malachite, and  lapis-lazuli, and sparkles with precious stones.    At the farther side of this court, another pair of towers and another  gateway lead you into the second court. Here we pass at once out of  brilliant sunlight into semi-darkness; for this court is entirely roofed  over, and no light enters it except from the doorway and from grated  slits in the roof. Look around you, and you will see the biggest single  chamber that was ever built by the hands of man. Down the centre run two  lines of gigantic pillars which hold up the roof, and form the nave of  the hall; and beyond these on either side are the aisles, whose roofs  are supported by a perfect forest of smaller columns.    Look up to the twelve great pillars of the nave. They soar above your  head, seventy feet into the air, their capitals bending outwards in the  shape of open flowers. On each capital a hundred men could stand safely;  and the great stone roofing beams that stretch from pillar to pillar  weigh a hundred tons apiece. How were they ever brought to the place?  And, still more, how were they ever swung up to that dizzy height, and  laid in their places? Each of the great columns is sculptured with  figures and gaily painted, and the surrounding walls of the hall are all  decorated in the same way. But when you look at the pictures, you find  that it is no longer the wars of the King that are represented. The  inside of the temple is too holy for such things. Instead, you have  pictures of the gods, and of the King making all kinds of offerings to  them; and these pictures are repeated again and again, with endless  inscriptions, telling of the great gifts which Pharaoh has given to the  temple.    Finally we pass into the Holy of Holies. Here no light of day ever  enters at all. The chamber, smaller and lower than either of the others,  is in darkness except for the dim light of the lamp carried by the  attendant priest. Here stands the shrine, a great block of granite, hewn  into a dwelling-place for the figure of the god. It is closed with cedar  doors covered with gold plates, and the doors are sealed; but if we  could persuade the priest to let us look within, we should see a small  wooden figure something like the one that we saw carried through the  streets of Thebes, dressed and painted, and surrounded by offerings of  meat, drink,"]]]
