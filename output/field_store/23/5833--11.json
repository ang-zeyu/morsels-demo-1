But previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves       we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations from       Africa. Yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions,       and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have       been hitherto defeated by his Majesty's negative: Thus preferring       the immediate advantages of a few British corsairs to the lasting       interests of the American States, and to the rights of human       nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice.[49]    With the same thought as that of the views expressed above Jefferson  incorporated into the original Declaration of Independence an  indictment of George III as promoting the ruin of the colonies in  encouraging the slave trade. He said:         He (George III) has waged cruel war against human nature itself,       violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the       persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating       and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur       miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical       warfare, the opprobrium of INFIDEL powers, is the warfare of the       CHRISTIAN KING of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market       where MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his       negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or       to restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of       horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye, he is now       exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to       purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering       the people upon whom he has obtruded them; thus paying off former       crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of one people, with crimes       which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.[50]      II    Influenced by the struggle for the rights of man, Jefferson seriously  advocated freeing the Negroes, that they too might work out their own  destiny on foreign soil. He did not think that it would be wise to  leave the freedmen in this country controlled by white men by whom he  believed they should not be assimilated.[51] The first time he had an  opportunity, therefore, he made an effort in this direction. This was  the case of his work in connection with the committee appointed to  revise the laws of Virginia, the report of which he prepared.    Jefferson said:         The bill reported by the revisers of the whole (Virginia) code       does not itself contain the proposition to emancipate all slaves       born after the passing the act; but an amendment containing it       was prepared, to be offered to the Legislature whenever the bill       should be taken up, and further directing, that they should       continue with their parents to a certain age, then to be brought       up, at the public expense, to tillage, arts or sciences,       according to their geniuses, till the females should be eighteen,       and the males twenty-one years of age, when they should be       colonized to such place as the circumstances of the time should       render most proper, sending them out with arms, implements of       household and of the handicraft arts; seeds, pairs of the useful       domestic animals, &c., to declare them a free and independent       people, and extend to them our alliance and protection, till they       shall have acquired strength; and to send vessels at the same       time to other parts of the world for an equal number of white       inhabitants; to induce them to migrate hither, proper       encouragements were to be proposed.[52]    Discussing the serious difficulties of the problem, he compared that  of the Romans with the situation in the colonies:         This unfortunate difference of color, and perhaps of faculty, is       a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these people. Many of       their advocates, while they wish to vindicate the liberty of       human nature, are anxious also to preserve its dignity and       beauty. Some of these, embarrassed by the question; \"What further       is to be done with them?\" join themselves in opposition with       those who are actuated by sordid avarice only. Among the Romans       emancipation required but one effort. The slave, when made free,       might mix with, without straining the blood of his master. But       with us a second is necessary, unknown to history. When freed, he       is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.[53]    Writing to John Lynch in 1811, Jeff arson gave his ideas as to the  possibility of successful African colonization.         You ask my opinion on the proposition of Mrs. Mifflin, to take       measures for procuring, on the coast of Africa, an establishment       to which the people of color of these States might, from time to       time be colonized, under the auspices of different governments.       Having long ago made up my mind on this subject, I have no       hesitation in saying that I have ever thought it the most       desirable measure which could be adopted, for gradually drawing       off this part of our population, most advantageously for       themselves as well as for us. Going from a country possessing all       the useful arts, they might be the means of transplanting them       among the inhabitants of Africa, and would thus carry back to the       country of their origin, the seeds of civilization which might       render their sojournment and sufferings here a blessing in the       end to that country.[54]         Nothing is more to be wished than that the United States would       themselves undertake to make such an establishment on the coast       of Africa. Exclusive of motives of humanity, the commercial       advantages to be derived from it might repay all its expenses.       But for this, the national mind is not yet prepared. It may       perhaps be doubted whether many of these people would voluntarily       consent to such an exchange of situation, and very certain that       few of those advanced to a certain age in habits of slavery,       would be capable of self-government. This should not, however,       discourage the experiment, not the early trial of it.[55]         I received in the first year of my coming into the administration       of the General Government, a letter from the Governor of Virginia       (Colonel Monroe), consulting me, at the request of the       Legislature of the State, on the means of procuring some such       asylum, to which these people might be occasionally sent. I       proposed to him the establishment of Sierra Leone, in which a       private company in England had already colonized a number of       negroes and particularly the fugitives from these States during       the Revolutionary War; and at the same time suggested, if this       could be obtained, some of the Portuguese possessions in South       America, as next most desirable. The subsequent Legislature       approving these ideas, I wrote, the ensuing year, 1802, to Mr.       King, our Minister in London, to endeavor to negotiate with the       Sierra Leone company a reception of such of these people as might       be colonized thither. He opened a correspondence with Mr.       Wedderbourne and Mr. Thornton, secretaries of the company, on the       subject, and, in 1803, I received through Mr. King the result,       which was that the colony was going on, but in a languishing       condition; that the funds of the company were likely to fail, as       they received no returns of profit to keep them up; that they       were, therefore, in treaty with their government to take the       establishment off their hands; but that in no event should they       be willing to receive more of these people from the United       States, as it was exactly that portion of their settlers which       had gone from hence, which, by their idleness and turbulence, had       kept the settlement in constant danger of dissolution, which       could not have been prevented but for the aid of the maroon       negroes from the West Indies, who were more industrious and       orderly than the others, and supported the authority of the       government and its laws ... The effort which I made with       Portugal, to obtain an establishment for them within their claims       in South America, proved also abortive.[56]    In this extract Jefferson goes a step further in presenting a scheme  for financing the project, giving even the exact amount which he  thought would suffice.         In the disposition of these unfortunate people, there are two       rational objects to be distinctly kept in view. First. The       establishment of a colony on the coast of Africa, which may       introduce among the aborigines the arts of cultivated life and       the blessings of civilization and science. By doing this, we may       make to them some retribution for the long course of injuries we       have been committing on their population. And considering that       these blessings will descend to the _nati natorum et qui       nascentur ab illis_, we shall in the long run have rendered them       perhaps more good than evil. To fulfil this object, the colony of       Sierra Leone promises well, and that of Mesurado adds to our       prospect of success. Under this view the Colonization Society is       to be considered as a missionary society, having in view,       however, objects more humane, more justifiable, and less       aggressive on the peace of other nations than the others of that       appelation. The second object, and the most interesting to us, as       coming home to our physical and moral characters, to our       happiness and safety, is to provide an asylum to which we can, by       degrees, send the whole of that population from among us, and       establish them under our patronage and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose. Volume I (of X) - Greece (#13)"],[1,"; for then they do not care whether their  common-place phrases seem to be out of date or not, but loudly  reiterate the old appeals, believing that they may be of some service  at the awful moment. When he thought that he had exhorted them, not  enough, but as much as the scanty time allowed, he retired, and led  the land-forces to the shore, extending the line as far as he could,  so that they might be of the greatest use in encouraging the  combatants on board ship. Demosthenes,[41] Menander, and Euthydemus,  who had gone on board the Athenian fleet to take command, now quitted  their own station, and proceeded straight to the closed mouth of the  harbor, intending to force their way to the open sea where a passage  was still left.    The Syracusans and their allies had already put out with nearly the  same number of ships as before. A detachment of them guarded the  entrance of the harbor; the remainder were disposed all round it in  such a manner that they might fall on the Athenians from every side at  once, and that their land-forces might at the same time be able to  cooperate whenever the ships retreated to the shore. Sicanus and  Agatharchus commanded the Syracusan fleet, each of them a wing; Pythen  and the Corinthians occupied the center.    When the Athenians approached the closed mouth of the harbor, the  violence of their onset overpowered the ships which were stationed  there; they then attempted to loosen the fastenings. Whereupon from  all sides the Syracusans and their allies came bearing down upon them,  and the conflict was no longer confined to the entrance, but extended  throughout the harbor. No previous engagement had been so fierce and  obstinate. Great was the eagerness with which the rowers on both sides  rushed upon their enemies whenever the word of command was given; and  keen was the contest between the pilots as they maneuvered one against  another. The marines too were full of anxiety that, when ship struck  ship, the service on deck should not fall short of the rest; every one  in the place assigned to him was eager to be foremost among his  fellows. Many vessels meeting--and never did so many fight in so small  a space, for the two fleets together amounted to nearly two  hundred--they were seldom able to strike in the regular manner,  because they had no opportunity of first retiring or breaking the  line; they generally fouled one another as ship dashed against ship in  the hurry of flight or pursuit. All the time that another vessel was  bearing down, the men on deck poured showers of javelins and arrows  and stones upon the enemy; and when the two closed, the marines fought  hand to hand, and endeavored to board. In many places, owing to the  want of room, they who had struck another found that they were struck  themselves; often two or even more vessels were unavoidably entangled  about one, and the pilots had to make plans of attack and defense,  not against one adversary only, but against several coming from  different sides.    The crash of so many ships dashing against one another took away the  wits of the sailors, and made it impossible to hear the boatswains,  whose voices in both fleets rose high, as they gave directions to the  rowers, or cheered them on in the excitement of the struggle. On the  Athenians' side they were shouting to their men that they must force a  passage and seize the opportunity now or never of returning in safety  to their native land. To the Syracusans and their allies was  represented the glory of preventing the escape of their enemies, and  of a victory by which every man would exalt the honor of his own city.  The commanders, too, when they saw any ship backing water without  necessity, would call the captain by his name, and ask, of the  Athenians, whether they were retreating because they expected to be  more at home upon the land of their bitterest foes than upon that sea  which had been their own so long; on the Syracusan side, whether, when  they knew perfectly well that the Athenians were only eager to find  some means of flight, they would themselves fly from the fugitives.    While the naval engagement hung in the balance, the two armies on  shore had great trial and conflict of soul. The Sicilian soldier was  animated by the hope of increasing the glory which he had already won,  while the invader was tormented by the fear that his fortunes might  sink lower still. The last chance of the Athenians lay in their ships,  and their anxiety was dreadful. The fortune of the battle varied; and  it was not possible that the spectators on the shore should all  receive the same impression of it. Being quite close and having  different points of view, they would some of them see their own ships  victorious; their courage would then revive, and they would earnestly  call upon the gods not to take from them their hope of deliverance.  But others, who saw their ships worsted, cried and shrieked aloud, and  were by the sight alone more utterly unnerved than the defeated  combatants themselves. Others again who had fixt their gaze on some  part of the struggle which was undecided, were in a state of  excitement still more terrible; they kept swaying their bodies to and  fro in an agony of hope and fear as the stubborn conflict went on and  on; for at every instant they were all but saved or all but lost. And  while the strife hung in the balance, you might hear in the Athenian  army at once lamentation, shouting, cries of victory or defeat, and  all the various sounds which are wrung from a great host in extremity  of danger. Not less agonizing were the feelings of those on board.    At length the Syracusans and their allies, after a protracted  struggle, put the Athenians to flight, and triumphantly bearing down  upon them, and encouraging one another with loud cries and  exhortations, drove them to the land. Then that part of the navy which  had not been taken in the deep water fell back in confusion to the  shore, and the crews rushed out of the ships into the camp. And the  land-forces, no longer now divided in feeling, but uttering one  universal groan of intolerable anguish ran, some of them to save the  ships, others to defend what remained of the wall; but the greater  number began to look to themselves and to their own safety. Never had  there been a greater panic in an Athenian army than at that moment.  They now suffered what they had done to others at Pylos. For at  Pylos[42] the Lacedaemonians, when they saw their ships destroyed, knew  that their friends who had crossed over into the island of  Sphacteria[43] were lost with them. And so now the Athenians, after  the rout of their fleet, knew that they had no hope of saving  themselves by land unless events took some extraordinary turn.    Thus, after a fierce battle and great destruction of ships and men on  both sides, the Syracusans and their allies gained the victory. They  gathered up the wrecks and bodies of the dead, and sailing back to the  city, erected a trophy. The Athenians, overwhelmed by their misery,  never so much as thought of recovering their wrecks or of asking leave  to collect their dead. Their intention was to retreat that very  night....    On the third day after the sea-fight, when Nicias and Demosthenes  thought that their preparations were complete, the army began to move.  They were in a dreadful condition; not only was there the great fact  that they had lost their whole fleet, and instead of their expected  triumph had brought the utmost peril upon Athens as well as upon  themselves, but also the sights which presented themselves as they  quitted the camp were painful to every eye and mind. The dead were  unburied, and when any one saw the body of a friend lying on the  ground he was smitten with sorrow and dread, while the sick or wounded  who still survived but had to be left were even a greater trial to the  living, and more to be pitied than those who were gone. Their prayers  and lamentations drove their companions to distraction; they would beg  that they might be taken with them, and call by name any friend or  relative whom they saw passing; they would hang upon their departing  comrades and follow as far as they could, and when their limbs and  strength failed them and they dropt behind, many were the imprecations  and cries which they uttered. So that the whole army was in tears, and  such was their despair that they could hardly make up their minds to  stir altho they were leaving an enemy's country, having suffered  calamities too great for tears already, and dreading miseries yet  greater in the unknown future.    There was also a general feeling of shame and self-reproach--indeed  they seemed, not like an army, but like a fugitive population of a  city captured after a siege, and of a great city too. For the whole  multitude who were marching together numbered not less than forty  thousand. Each of them took with him anything he could carry which was  likely to be of use. Even the heavy-armed and cavalry, contrary to  their practise when under arms, conveyed about their persons their own  food, some because they had no attendants, others because they could  not trust them; for they had long been deserting, and most of them  had gone off all at once. Nor was the food which they carried  sufficient, for the supplies of the camp had failed. Their disgrace  and the universality of the misery, altho there might be some  consolation in the very community of suffering, was nevertheless at  that moment hard to bear, especially when they remembered from what  pomp and splendor they had fallen into their present low estate. Never  had a Hellenic army experienced such a reverse. They had come  intending to enslave others, and they were going away in fear that  they would be themselves enslaved. Instead of the prayers and hymns  with which they had put to sea, they were now departing amid appeals  to heaven of another sort. They were no longer"]]]
