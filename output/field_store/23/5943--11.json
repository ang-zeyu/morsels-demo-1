It did do some good, for she swum  higher; but we got mighty slow through the water, an' I hed but leetle  behopes we should reach land.    \"I wur towed in this way about a quarter o' a mile, when I spied  somethin' floatin' on the water a leetle ahead.  It hed growed  considerably darker; but thur wur still light enough to show me that the  thing wur a log.    \"An idee now entered my brain-pan, that I mout save meself by takin' to  the log.  The mar ud then have a better chance for herself; an' maybe,  when eased o' draggin' my carcass, that wur a-keepin' her back, she mout  make footin' somewhur.  So I waited till she got a leetle closter; an'  then, lettin' go o' her tail, I clasped the log, an' crawled on to it.    \"The mar swum on, appeerintly 'ithout missin' me.  I seed her disappear  through the darkness; but I didn't as much as say good-bye to her, for I  wur afeard that my voice mout bring her back agin', an' she mout strike  the log with her hoofs, an' whammel it about.  So I lay quiet, an' let  her hev her own way.    \"I wan't long on the log till I seed it wur a-driftin', for thur wur a  current in the water that set tol'uble sharp acrosst the parairy.  I hed  crawled up at one eend, an' got stride-legs; but as the log dipped  considerable, I wur still over the hams in the water.    \"I thort I mout be more comfortable towards the middle, an' wur about to  pull the thing more under me, when all at once I seed thur wur somethin'  clumped up on t'other eend o' the log.    \"'Twan't very clur at the time, for it had been a-growin' cloudier ever  since I left the shanty, but 'twur clur enough to show me that the thing  wur a varmint: what sort, I couldn't tell.  It mout be a bar, an' it  mout not; but I had my suspects it wur eyther a bar or a painter.    \"I wan't left long in doubt about the thing's gender.  The log kep  makin' circles as it drifted, an' when the varmint kim round into a  different light, I caught a glimp o' its eyes.  I knew them eyes to be  no bar's eyes: they wur painter's eyes, an' no mistake.    \"I reckin, strengers, I felt very queery jest about then.  I didn't try  to go any nearer the middle o' the log; but instead of that, I wriggled  back until I wur right plum on the eend of it, an' could git no further.    \"Thur I sot for a good long spell 'ithout movin' hand or foot.  I  dasen't make a motion, as I wur afeard it mout tempt the varmint to  attackt me.    \"I hed no weepun but my knife; I hed let go o' my rifle when I slid from  the mar's back, an' it hed gone to the bottom long since.  I wan't in  any condition to stand a tussle with the painter nohow; so I 'wur  determined to let him alone as long's he ud me.    \"Wal, we drifted on for a good hour, I guess, 'ithout eyther o' us  stirrin'.  We sot face to face; an' now an' then the current ud set the  log in a sort o' up-an'-down motion, an' then the painter an' I kep  bowin' to each other like a pair o' bob-sawyers.  I could see all the  while that the varmint's eyes wur fixed upon mine, an' I never tuk mine  from hisn; I know'd 'twur the only way to keep him still.    \"I wur jest prospectin' what ud be the eendin' o' the business, when I  seed we wur a-gettin' closter to the timmer: 'twan't more 'n two miles  off, but 'twur all under water 'ceptin' the tops o' the trees.  I wur  thinkin' that when the log shed float in among the branches, I mout slip  off, an' git my claws upon a tree, 'ithout sayin anythin' to my  travellin' companion.    \"Jest at that minnit somethin' appeared dead ahead o' the log.  It wur  like a island; but what could hev brought a island thur?  Then I  recollects that I hed seed a piece o' high ground about that part o' the  parairy--a sort o' mound that hed been made by Injuns, I s'pose.  This,  then, that looked like a island, wur the top o' that mound, sure enough.    \"The log wur a-driftin' in sich a way that I seed it must pass within  twenty yards o' the mound.  I detarmined then, as soon as we shed git  alongside, to put out for it, an' leave the painter to continue his  voyage 'ithout me.    \"When I fust sighted the island I seed somethin' that; hed tuk for  bushes.  But thur wan't no bushes on the mound--that I knowd.    \"Howsomdever, when we got a leetle closter, I diskivered that the bushes  wur beests.  They wur deer; for I spied a pair o' buck's horns atween me  an' the sky.  But thur wur a somethin' still bigger than a deer.  It  mout be a hoss, or it mout be an Opelousa ox, but I thort it wur a hoss.    \"I wur right about that, for a horse it wur, sure enough, or rayther I  shed say, a _mar_, an' that mar no other than my ole crittur!    \"Arter partin' company, she hed turned with the current; an', as good  luck ud hev it, hed swum in a beeline for the island, an' thur she stood  lookin' as slick as if she hed been greased.    \"The log hed by this got nigh enough, as I kalklated; an', with as  little rumpus as possible, I slipped over the eend an' lot go my hold o'  it.  I wan't right spread in the water, afore I heerd a plump, an'  lookin' round a bit, I seed the painter hed left the log too, an' tuk to  the water.    \"At fust, I thort he wur arter me; an' I drawed my knife with one hand,  while I swum with the other.  But the painter didn't mean fight that  time.  He made but poor swimmin' himself, an' appeared glad enough to  get upon dry groun' 'ithout molestin' me; so we swum on side by side,  an' not a word passed atween us.    \"I didn't want to make a race o' it; so I let him pass me, rayther than  that he should fall behind, an' get among my legs.    \"Of coorse, he landed fust; an' I could hear by the stompin' o' hoofs,  that his suddint appearance hed kicked up a jolly stampede among the  critters upon the island.  I could see both deer and mar dancing all  over the groun', as if Old Nick himself hed got among 'em.    \"None o' 'em, howsomdever, thort o' takin' to the water.  They hed all  hed enough o' that, I guess.    \"I kep a leetle round, so as not to land near the painter; an' then,  touchin' bottom, I climbed quietly up on the mound.  I hed hardly drawed  my drippin' carcass out o' the water, when I heerd a loud squeal, which  I knew to be the whigher o' my ole mar; an' jest at that minnit the  critter kim runnin' up, an' rubbed her nose agin my shoulder.  I tuk the  halter in my hand, an' sidling round a leetle, I jumped upon her back,  for I still wur in fear o' the painter; an' the mar's back appeared to  me the safest place about, an' that wan't very safe, eyther.    \"I now looked all round to see what new company I hed got into.  The day  wur jest breakin', an' I could distinguish a leetle better every minnit.  The top o' the mound which, wur above water wan't over half an acre in  size, an' it wur as clur o' timmer as any other part o' the parairy, so  that I could see every inch o' it, an' everythin' on it as big as a  tumble-bug.    \"I reckin, strengers, that you'll hardly believe me when I tell you the  concatenation o' varmints that wur then an' thur caucused together.  I  could hardly believe my own eyes when I seed sich a gatherin', an' I  thort I hed got aboard o' Noah's Ark.  Thur wur--listen, strengers--fust  my ole mar an' meself, an' I wished both o' us anywhur else, I reckin--  then thur wur the painter, yur old acquaintance--then thur wur four  deer, a buck an' three does.  Then kim a catamount; an' arter him a  black bar, a'most as big as a buffalo.  Then thur wur a 'coon an' a  'possum, an' a kupple o' grey wolves, an' a swamp rabbit, an', darn the  thing! a stinkin' skunk.  Perhaps the last wan't the most dangerous  varmint on the groun', but it sartintly wur the most disagreeableest o'  the hul lot, for it smelt only as a cussed polecat kin smell.    \"I've said, strengers, that I wur mightily tuk by surprise when I fust  seed this curious clanjamfrey o' critters; but I kin tell you I wur  still more dumbfounded when I seed thur behaveyur to one another,  knowin' thur different naturs as I did.  Thur wur the painter lyin'  clost up to the deer--its nat'ral prey; an' thur wur the wolves too; an'  thur wur the catamount standin' within three feet o' the 'possum an' the  swamp rabbit; an' thur wur the bar an' the cunnin' old 'coon; an' thur  they all wur, no more mindin' one another than if they hed spent all  thur days together in the same penn.    \"'Twur the oddest sight I ever seed, an' it remembered me o' bit o'  Scripter my ole mother hed often read from a book called the Bible, or  some sich name--about a lion that wur so tame he used to squat down  beside a lamb, 'ithout layin' a claw upon the innocent critter.    \"Wal, stranger, as I'm sayin', the hul party behaved in this very way.  They all appeared down in the mouth, an' badly skeart about the water;  but for all that, I hed my fears that the painter or the bar--I wan't  afeard o' any o' the others--mout git over thur fright afore the flood  fell; an' thurfore I kept as quiet as any one o' them during the hul  time I wur in thur company, an' stayin' all the time clost by the mar.  But neyther bar nor painter showed any savage sign the hul o' the next  day, nor the night that follered it.    \"Strengers, it ud tire you wur I to tell you all the movements that tuk  place among these critters durin' that long day an' night.  Ne'er a one  o' 'em laid tooth or claw on the other.  I wur hungry enough meself, and  ud a liked to hev taken a steak from the buttocks o' one o' the deer,  but I dasen't do it.  I wur afeard to break the peace, which mout a led  to a general shindy.    \"When day broke, next mornin' arter, I seed that the flood wur afallin';  and as soon as it wur shallow enough, I led my mar quietly into the  water, an' climbin' upon her back, tuk a silent leave o' my companions.  The water still tuk my mar up to the flanks, so that I knew none o' the  varmint could follow 'ithout swimmin', an' ne'er a one seemed inclined  to try a swim.    \"I struck"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#13)"],[1,"the Prophet.    Col. George M. Hinkle had command of the troops at Far West,  under the Prophet Joseph. He was from Kentucky, and considered a  fair-weather Saint. When danger came he was certain to be on the  strong side. He was a fine speaker, and had great influence with  the Saints. Previous to the attack on Far West Col. Hinkle had  come to an understanding with the Gentile commanders that in case  the danger grew great they could depend on him as a friend and  one through whom they could negotiate and learn the situation of  affairs in the camp of the Saints. When our scouts were first  driven in Col. Hinkle was out with them, and when they were  closely pursued he turned his coat wrong side out and wore it so.    This was a peculiar move, but at the time it did not cause much  comment among his men; but they reported it to the Prophet, and  he at once became suspicious of the Colonel. The Prophet, being a  man of thought and cool reflection, kept this information within  a small circle, as it was a bad time to ventilate an act of that  kind.    The Prophet concluded to make use of the knowledge he had gained  of Hinkle's character, and employ him to negotiate between the  two parties. I do not believe that Joseph had the least idea that  he, with his little handful of men, could stand off the army that  had come up against him. I know that now, but at the time I was  full of religious zeal and felt that the Mormon Hosts of Israel  were invincible. Joseph wished to use Hinkle to learn the designs  of the Gentiles, so that he could prepare for the worst. Col.  Hinkle was therefore sent by Joseph to have an interview with the  Gentiles.    The Colonel returned and reported to Joseph the terms proposed by  the Gentile officers. The terms offered were as follows: Joseph  and the leading men of the Church, Rigdon, Lyman White, P. P.  Pratt, Phelps, and others, were to give themselves up without  delay; the remainder of the men were to surrender themselves and  their arms by ten o'clock the following day, the understanding  being that all would be tried for treason against the Government,  and for other offenses.    The Prophet took advantage of this information, and had every man  that was in imminent danger leave the camp for a place of safety.  The most of those in peril went to Illinois. They left at once,  and were safe from all pursuit before the surrender took place,  as they traveled north and avoided the settlements.    When the brethren had left for Illinois, as just stated, Joseph  called his remaining troops together and told them they were a  good lot of fellows, but they were not perfect enough to  withstand so large an army as the one now before them; that they  had stood by him, and were willing to die for and with him, for  the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven; that he wished them to be  comforted, for God had accepted their offering; that he intended  to, and was going to offer himself up as a sacrifice, to save  their lives and to save the Church. He wished them to be of good  cheer, and pray for him, and to pray that he and the brethren  that went with him might be delivered from their enemies. He then  blessed his people in the name of the Lord. After that he and the  leading men, six in number, went direct to the camp of the enemy.    They were led by a Judas, Col. G. M. Hinkle. I stood upon the  breastworks and watched them go into the camp of the enemy. I  heard the yells of triumph of the troops as Joseph and his  companions approached. It was with great difficulty that the  officers could restrain the mob from shooting them down as they  entered. A strong guard was then placed over them to protect them  from mob violence.    The next morning a court-martial was held, at which Joseph and  his six companions who had surrendered with him were sentenced to  be shot. The execution was to take place at eight o'clock the  next morning. When the sentence of the court-martial was  announced to them, Col. Lyman White said:    \"Shoot and be damned!\"    Gen. Atchison and Col. Doniphan arrived with their divisions the  same day, soon after the court-martial had been held. Col.  Doniphan, in particular, remonstrated against the decision. He  said it was nothing more nor less than cold-blooded murder, and  that every name signed to the decision was signed in blood, and  he would withdraw his troops and have nothing to do in the matter  if the men were to be shot. Gen. Atchison sustained Col.  Doniphan, and said the wiser policy would be, inasmuch as they  had surrendered themselves as prisoners, to place them in the  Richmond jail and let them take the due course of the law; let  them be tried by the civil authorities of the land. In this way  justice could be reached and parties punished according to law,  and thus save the honor of the troops and the nation. This timely  interposition on the part of Col. Doniphan and Gen. Atchison  changed the course and prevented the hasty action of an  infuriated mob calling itself a court, and composed of men who  were the bitter enemies of Joseph and his followers.    The next day a writing desk was prepared, with two secretaries or  clerks; it was placed in the middle of the hollow square formed  by the troops. The Mormons were marched in double file across the  center of the square, where the officers and men who had remained  in Far West surrendered themselves and their arms to Gen. Clark,  Commander-in-Chief of the Missouri militia, then in arms against  the Saints at Far West. I was among the number that then  surrendered. I laid down a good Kentucky rifle, two good horse  pistols, and a sword.    After stacking our arms we were marched in single file between a  double file of the militia, who stood in a line from the  secretary's desk extending nearly across the square, ready to  receive us, with fixed bayonets. As each man came up he stepped  to the desk and signed his name to an instrument recapitulating  the conditions of the treaty, which were substantially as  follows: We were to give a deed to all our real estate, and to  give a bill of sale of our personal property, to pay the expenses  of the war that had been inaugurated against us; also a committee  of twelve should be appointed, one for Far West and one for Adam-  on-Diamond, who were to be the sole judges of what would be  necessary to remove each family out of the State. All of the  Mormons were to leave Missouri by the 1st of April, A. D. 1839.  The rest of the property of the Mormons was to be taken by the  Missouri troops to pay the expenses of the war. When the  committee had examined into affairs and made the assignment of  property that the Mormons were to retain, a pass would be given  by the committee to each person as an evidence that he had gone  through an investigation both as to his conduct and property. The  prisoners at Far West were to be retained and not allowed to  return home until the committee had reported and given the  certificate that all charges had been met and satisfied. I  remained a prisoner for nine days, awaiting the action of the  committee.    While such prisoner I witnessed many scenes of inhumanity even  more degrading than mere brutality itself. The mob of the militia  was mostly composed of men who had been neighbors of the Mormons.  This mob rifled the city, took what they wished, and committed  many cruel and shameful deeds. These barbarous acts were done  because they said the Mormons had stolen their goods and  chattels, and while they pretended to search for stolen property  they ravished women and committed other crimes at will.    One day, while we were standing by a log fire trying to keep  warm, a man came up and, recognizing Brother Riley Stewart, said:    \"I saw you knock Dick Weldon down at Gallatin.\"    With this he sprang and caught at an ax that had been stuck in a  log. While trying to get the ax out, as it stuck fast in the log,  Stewart ran. The man succeeded in getting the ax loose; he then  threw it with all his force at Stewart. Fortunately the ax struck  him only a glancing blow on the head, not killing him, but giving  him a severe wound.    The night after he was wounded Stewart broke through the guard  and escaped to his wife's people in Carroll County, fifty miles  south of Far West. As soon as the citizens heard that Stewart had  arrived they notified his wife's brothers and father that an  armed mob intended to take him out and whip him severely, and  then tar and feather him. His friends warned him of the fact, and  he attempted to make his escape, but the mob was on the watch.  They caught him, and, holding two pistols at his head, forced him  to take off his coat, kneel down, and receive fifty lashes. These  were given him with such force that they cut through his linen  shirt. After this whipping he returned to Far West and took his  chances with the rest of us.    One day a soldier of the mob walked up to a house near where I  was standing. The house was occupied by an old widow woman. The  soldier noticed a cow in the little shed near the house. He said  that he thought it was a Danite cow; that he wanted to have the  honor of killing a Danite, or something that belonged to a  Danite. The old widow came to the door of her cabin and begged  him to spare her cow, saying it was her only dependence for milk,  that she had no meat, and if her cow was killed she must suffer.    \"Well, then,\" said he, \"you can eat the cow for a change.\"    He then shot the cow dead, and stood there and tantalized the old  woman while she cried over her loss.    While we were standing in line, waiting our turn to sign the  treaty, a large company of men, painted like Indians, rode up and  surrounded us. They were a part of the men who were in the fight  at the town of Gallatin on the day of election. They abused us in  every way they could with words. This treatment was hard to bear,  but we were powerless to protect ourselves in any way.      "]]]
