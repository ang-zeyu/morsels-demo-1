[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#13)"],[1,"beautiful or so rich as I am. I have sown  pleasure in my footsteps, and I am celebrated for that all over the  world. I am more powerful than the masters of the world. I have seen  them at my feet. Look at me, look at these little feet; thousands of men  would pay with their blood for the happiness of kissing them. I am not  very big, and I do not occupy much space on the earth. To those who look  at me from the top of the Serapeium, when I pass in the street, I look  like a grain of rice; but that grain of rice has caused among men,  griefs, despairs, hates, and crimes enough to have filled Tartarus. Are  you not mad to talk to me of shame when all around proclaims my glory?\"    \"That which is glory in the eyes of men, is infamy before God. O  woman, we have been nourished in countries so different, that it is not  surprising we have neither the same language nor the same thoughts! Yet  Heaven is my witness that I wish to agree with thee, and that it is my  intention not to leave thee until we share the same sentiments. Who will  inspire me with burning words that will melt thee like wax in my breath,  O woman, that the fingers of my desires may mould thee as they wish?  What virtue will deliver thee to me, O dearest of souls, that the spirit  which animates me, creating thee a second time, may imprint on thee a  fresh beauty, and that thou mayest cry, weeping for joy, 'It is only now  that I am born'? Who will cause to gush in my heart a fount of Siloam,  in which thou mayest bathe and recover thy first purity? Who will change  me into a Jordan, the waves of which sprinkled on thee, will give thee  life eternal?\"    Thais was no longer angry.    \"This man,\" she thought, \"talks of life eternal and all that he says  seems written on a talisman. No doubt he is a mage, and knows secret  charms against old age and death,\" and she resolved to offer herself to  him. Therefore, pretending to be afraid of him, she retired a few steps  to the end of the grotto, and sitting down on the edge of the bed,  artfully pulled her tunic across her breast; then, motionless and mute  and her eyes cast down, she waited. Her long eyelashes made a soft  shadow on her cheeks. Her entire attitude expressed modesty; her naked  feet swung gently, and she looked like a child sitting thinking on the  bank of a brook. But Paphnutius looked at her, and did not move. His  trembling knees hardly supported him, his tongue dried in his mouth, a  terrible buzzing rang in his ears. But all at once his sight failed, and  he could see nothing before him but a thick cloud. He thought that the  hand of Jesus had been laid on his eyes, to hide this woman from them.  Reassured by such succour, strengthened and fortified, he said with a  gravity worthy of an old hermit of the desert--    \"If thou givest thyself to me, thinkest thou it is hidden from God?\"    She shook her head.    \"God? Who forces Him to keep His eye always upon the Grotto of Nymphs?  Let Him go away if we offend Him! But why should we offend Him? Since  He has created us, He can be neither angry nor surprised to see us as He  made us, and acting according to the nature He has given us. A good deal  too much is said on His behalf, and He is often credited with ideas He  never had. You yourself, stranger, do you know His true character? Who  are you that you should speak to me in His name?\"    At this question the monk, opening his borrowed robe, showed the  cassock, and said--    \"I am Paphnutius, Abbot of Antinoe, and I come from the holy desert. The  hand that drew Abraham from Chaldaea and Lot from Sodom has separated me  from the present age. I no longer existed for the men of this century.  But thy image appeared to me in my sandy Jerusalem, and I knew that  thou wert full of corruption, and death was in thee. And now I am before  thee, woman, as before a grave, and I cry unto thee, 'Thais, arise!'\"    At the words, Paphnutius, monk, and abbot, she had turned pale with  fright. And now, with dishevelled hair and joined hands, weeping and  groaning, she dragged herself to the feet of the saint.    \"Do not hurt me! Why have you come? What do you want of me? Do not hurt  me! I know that the saints of the desert hate women who, like me, are  made to please. I am afraid that you hate me, and want to hurt me. Go!  I do not doubt your power. But know, Paphnutius, that you should neither  despise me nor hate me. I have never, like many of the men I know,  laughed at your voluntary poverty. In your turn, do not make a crime  of my riches. I am beautiful, and clever in acting. I no more chose my  condition than my nature. I was made for that which I do. I was born to  charm men. And you yourself, did you not say just now that you loved me?  Do not use your science against me. Do not pronounce magic words which  would destroy my beauty, or change me into a statue of salt. Do not  terrify me! I am already too frightened. Do not kill me! I am so afraid  of death.\"    He made a sign to her to rise, and said--    \"Child, have no fear. I will utter no word of shame or scorn. I come on  behalf of Him who sat on the edge of the well, and drank of the pitcher  which the woman of Samaria offered to Him; and who, also, when He supped  at the house of Simon, received the perfumes of Mary. I am not without  sin that I should throw the first stone. I have often badly employed  the abundant grace which God has bestowed upon me. It was not anger,  but pity, which took me by the hand to conduct me here. I can, without  deceit, address thee in words of love, for it is the zeal in my heart  which has brought me to thee. I burn with the fire of charity, and if  thy eyes, accustomed only to the gross sights of the flesh, could see  things in their mystic aspect, I should appear unto thee as a branch  broken off the burning bush which the Lord showed on the mountain to  Moses of old, that he might understand true love--that which envelops  us, and which, so far from leaving behind it mere coals and ashes,  purifies and perfumes for ever that which it penetrates.\"    \"I believe you, monk, and no longer fear either deceit or ill-will from  you. I have often heard talk of the hermits of the Thebaid. Marvellous  things have been told concerning Anthony and Paul. Your name is not  unknown to me, and I have heard say that, though you are still young,  you equal in virtue the oldest anchorites. As soon as I saw you, and  without knowing who you were, I felt that you were no ordinary man. Tell  me! can you do for me that which neither the priests of Isis, nor of  Hermes, nor of the celestial Juno, nor the Chaldean soothsayers, nor the  Babylonian magi have been able to effect? Monk, if you love me, can you  prevent me from dying?\"    \"Woman, whosoever wishes to live shall live. Flee from the abominable  delights in which thou diest for ever. Snatch from the devils, who will  burn it most horribly, that body which God kneaded with His spittle and  animated with his own breath. Thou art consumed with weariness; come,  and refresh thyself at the blessed springs of solitude; come and drink  of those fountains which are hidden in the desert, and which gush forth  to heaven. Careworn soul, come, and possess that which thou desirest!  Heart greedy for joy, come and taste true joys--poverty, retirement,  self-forgetfulness, seclusion in the bosom of God. Enemy of Christ now,  and to-morrow His well-beloved, come to Him! Come, thou whom I have  sought, and thou wilt say, 'I have found love!'\"    Thais seemed lost in meditation on things afar.    \"Monk,\" she asked, \"if I adjure all pleasures and do penance, is it true  that I shall be born again in heaven, my body intact in all its beauty?\"    \"Thais, I bring thee eternal life. Believe me, for that which I announce  to thee is the truth.\"    \"Who will assure me that it is the truth?\"    \"David and the prophets, the Scriptures, and the wonders that thou shalt  behold.\"    \"Monk, I should like to believe you, for I must confess that I have not  found happiness in this world. My lot in life is better than that of  a queen, and yet I have many bitternesses and misfortunes, and I am  infinitely weary of my existence. All women envy me, and yet sometimes  I have envied the lot of a toothless old woman who, when I was a child,  sold honey-cakes under one of the city gates. Often has the idea flashed  across my mind that only the poor are good, happy, and blessed, and that  there must be great gladness in living humble and obscure. Monk, you  have agitated a storm in my soul, and brought to the surface that which  lay at the bottom. Who am I to believe, alas! and what is to become of  me--and what is life?\"    Whilst she thus spoke, Paphnutius was transfigured; celestial joy beamed  in his face.    \"Listen!\" he said. \"I was not alone when I entered this house. Another  accompanied me, another who stands by my side. Him thou canst not see,  because thy eyes are yet unworthy to behold Him; but soon thou shalt see  Him in all His glorious splendour, and thou wilt say, 'He alone is to be  adored.' But now, if He had not placed His gentle hands before my eyes,  O Thais, I should perhaps have fallen into sin with thee, for of myself  I am but weak and sinful. But He saved us both. He is as good as He is  powerful, and His name is the Saviour. He was promised to the world, by  David and the prophets, worshipped in His cradle by the shepherds and  the magi, crucified by the Pharisees, buried by the holy women, revealed  to the world by the apostles, testified to by the martyrs. And now,  having learned that thou fearest death, O woman, He has come to thy  house to prevent thee from dying. Art Thou not here present with me,  Jesus, at this moment, as Thou didst appear to the men of Galilee, in  those wonderful days when the stars, which came down with thee from  heaven, were so near the earth that the holy innocents could take them  in their hands, when they played in their mothers' arms on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#13)"],[1," drink.\"    \"I wonder who it was? What did the gentleman look like?\"    \"He has a friendly laugh and wears a gold pendant with a red stone on  his thick gold chain; there is a horsehead on his cane.\"    \"Oh, that was the doctor--\" \"That was my old doctor,\" exclaimed father  and daughter at the same time.    In the evening, Mr. Sesemann told Miss Rottenmeier that Heidi was  going to remain, for the children were very fond of each other and he  found Heidi normal and very sweet. \"I want the child to be treated  kindly,\" Mr. Sesemann added decidedly. \"Her peculiarities must not be  punished. My mother is coming very soon to stay here, and she will  help you to manage the child, for there is nobody in this world that  my mother could not get along with, as you know, Miss Rottenmeier.\"    \"Of course, I know that, Mr. Sesemann,\" replied the lady, but she was  not very much pleased at the prospect.    Mr. Sesemann only stayed two weeks, for his business called him back  to Paris. He consoled his daughter by telling her that his mother was  coming in a very few days. Mr. Sesemann had hardly left, when the  grandmother's visit was announced for the following day.    Clara was looking forward to this visit, and told Heidi so much about  her dear grandmama that Heidi also began to call her by that name, to  Miss Rottenmeier's disapproval, who thought that the child was not  entitled to this intimacy.    [Illustration]          X    A GRANDMAMA      The following evening great expectation reigned in the house. Tinette  had put on a new cap, Sebastian was placing footstools in front of  nearly every armchair, and Miss Rottenmeier walked with great dignity  about the house, inspecting everything.    When the carriage at last drove up, the servants flew downstairs,  followed by Miss Rottenmeier in more measured step. Heidi had been  sent to her room to await further orders, but it was not long before  Tinette opened the door and said brusquely: \"Go into the study!\"    The grandmama, with her kind and loving way, immediately befriended  the child and made her feel as if she had known her always. To the  housekeeper's great mortification, she called the child Heidi,  remarking to Miss Rottenmeier: \"If somebody's name is Heidi, I call  her so.\"    The housekeeper soon found that she had to respect the grandmother's  ways and opinions. Mrs. Sesemann always knew what was going on in the  house the minute she entered it. On the following afternoon Clara was  resting and the old lady had shut her eyes for five minutes, when she  got up again and went into the dining-room. With a suspicion that the  housekeeper was probably asleep, she went to this lady's room,  knocking loudly on the door. After a while somebody stirred inside,  and with a bewildered face Miss Rottenmeier appeared, staring at the  unexpected visitor.    \"Rottenmeier, where is the child? How does she pass her time? I want  to know,\" said Mrs. Sesemann.    \"She just sits in her room, not moving a finger; she has not the  slightest desire to do something useful, and that is why she thinks of  such absurd things that one can hardly mention them in polite  society.\"    \"I should do exactly the same thing, if I were left alone like that.  Please bring her to my room now, I want to show her some pretty books  I have brought with me.\"    \"That is just the trouble. What should she do with books? In all this  time she has not even learned the A,B,C for it is impossible to instil  any knowledge into this being. If Mr. Candidate was not as patient as  an angel, he would have given up teaching her long ago.\"    \"How strange! The child does not look to me like one who cannot learn  the A,B,C,\" said Mrs. Sesemann. \"Please fetch her now; we can look at  the pictures anyway.\"    The housekeeper was going to say more, but the old lady had turned  already and gone to her room. She was thinking over what she had heard  about Heidi, making up her mind to look into the matter.    Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid  pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly  she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock  grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing,  leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over  everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene; but suddenly  she began to sob violently.    The grandmama took her little hand in hers and said in the most  soothing voice: \"Come, child, you must not cry. Did this remind you of  something? Now stop, and I'll tell you the story to-night. There are  lovely stories in this book, that people can read and tell. Dry your  tears now, darling, I must ask you something. Stand up now and look at  me! Now we are merry again!\"    Heidi did not stop at once, but the kind lady gave her ample time to  compose herself, saying from time to time: \"Now it's all over. Now  we'll be merry again.\"    When the child was quiet at last, she said: \"Tell me now how your  lessons are going. What have you learnt, child, tell me?\"    \"Nothing,\" Heidi sighed; \"but I knew that I never could learn it.\"    \"What is it that you can't learn?\"    \"I can't learn to read; it is too hard.\"    \"What next? Who gave you this information?\"    \"Peter told me, and he tried over and over again, but he could not do  it, for it is too hard.\"    \"Well, what kind of boy is he? Heidi, you must not believe what Peter  tells you, but try for yourself. I am sure you had your thoughts  elsewhere when Mr. Candidate showed you the letters.\"    \"It's no use,\" Heidi said with such a tone as if she was resigned to  her fate.    \"I am going to tell you something, Heidi,\" said the kind lady now.  \"You have not learnt to read because you have believed what Peter  said. You shall believe me now, and I prophesy that you will learn it  in a very short time, as a great many other children do that are like  you and not like Peter. When you can read, I am going to give you this  book. You have seen the shepherd on the green pasture, and then you'll  be able to find out all the strange things that happen to him. Yes,  you can hear the whole story, and what he does with his sheep and his  goats. You would like to know, wouldn't you, Heidi?\"    Heidi had listened attentively, and said now with sparkling eyes: \"If  I could only read already!\"    \"It won't be long, I can see that. Come now and let us go to Clara.\"  With that they both went over to the study.    Since the day of Heidi's attempted flight a great change had come over  the child. She had realized that it would hurt her kind friends if she  tried to go home again. She knew now that she could not leave, as her  Aunt Deta had promised, for they all, especially Clara and her father  and the old lady, would think her ungrateful. But the burden grew  heavier in her heart and she lost her appetite, and got paler and  paler. She could not get to sleep at night from longing to see the  mountains with the flowers and the sunshine, and only in her dreams  she would be happy. When she woke up in the morning, she always found  herself on her high white bed, far away from home. Burying her head in  her pillow, she would often weep a long, long time.    Mrs. Sesemann had noticed the child's unhappiness, but let a few days  pass by, hoping for a change. But the change never came, and often  Heidi's eyes were red even in the early morning. So she called the  child to her room one day and said, with great sympathy in her voice:  \"Tell me, Heidi, what is the matter with you? What is making you so  sad?\"    But as Heidi did not want to appear thankless, she replied sadly: \"I  can't tell you.\"    \"No? Can't you tell Clara perhaps?\"    \"Oh, no, I can't tell anyone,\" Heidi said, looking so unhappy that the  old lady's heart was filled with pity.    \"I tell you something, little girl,\" she continued. \"If you have a  sorrow that you cannot tell to anyone, you can go to Our Father in  Heaven. You can tell Him everything that troubles you, and if we ask  Him He can help us and take our suffering away. Do you understand me,  child? Don't you pray every night? Don't you thank Him for all His  gifts and ask Him to protect you from evil?\"    \"Oh no, I never do that,\" replied the child.    \"Have you never prayed, Heidi? Do you know what I mean?\"    \"I only prayed with my first grandmother, but it is so long ago, that  I have forgotten.\"    \"See, Heidi, I understand now why you are so unhappy. We all need  somebody to help us, and just think how wonderful it is, to be able to  go to the Lord, when something distresses us and causes us pain. We  can tell Him everything and ask Him to comfort us, when nobody else  can do it. He can give us happiness and joy.\"    Heidi was gladdened by these tidings, and asked: \"Can we tell Him  everything, everything?\"    \"Yes, Heidi, everything.\"    The child, withdrawing her hand from the grandmama, said hurriedly,  \"Can I go now?\"    \"Yes, of course,\" was the reply, and with this Heidi ran to her room.  Sitting down on a stool she folded her hands and poured out her heart  to God, imploring Him to help her and let her go home to her  grandfather.    About a week later, Mr. Candidate asked to see Mrs. Sesemann, to tell  her of something unusual that had occurred. Being called to the lady's  room, he began: \"Mrs. Sesemann, something has happened that I never  expected,\" and with many more words the happy grandmama was told that  Heidi had suddenly learned to read with the utmost correctness, most  rare with beginners.    \"Many strange things happen in this world,\" Mrs. Sesemann remarked,  while they went over to the study to witness Heidi's new  accomplishment. Heidi was sitting close to Clara, reading her a story;  she seemed amazed at the strange, new world that had opened up before  her. At supper Heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures  on her plate, and looking doubtfully at grandmama, she saw the"]]]
