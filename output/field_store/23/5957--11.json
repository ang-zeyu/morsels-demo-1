Now I want some breakfast, and I am going to get up.\"        CHAPTER TEN.    SHAM.    The doctor suggested that after such a broken night it would be as well  to have an early breakfast before they started.    \"Yes, capital,\" cried Mark.  \"I feel that that is just what I want to  put me right.\"    \"See to it at once, then, Dan,\" said the doctor.  \"Tell some of the men  to get you some wood, and I will talk to the bullock drivers.  Oh, there  are the two keepers.  They will help you to get wood and fetch water.  Mind they get it from a clear part of the river.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir!\" said the sailor.    \"How wonderfully well that poor fellow begins to look,\" said the doctor.    \"Yes,\" replied Sir James, laughing; \"and he thoroughly deserves the name  of the Handy Mann.  He is never happy unless he is doing something--  regularly valeting me and the boys.  What do you say to a walk round  while they are preparing breakfast?\"    \"I am willing,\" replied the doctor, \"and we will take Denham and his men  as we go.\"    They started off, and before they reached the two long spans of oxen  where they had been turned to graze, Buck Denham's voice was heard  storming at somebody.    \"Quarrel, seemingly, captain,\" said Sir James, smiling.    \"Or a fit of bad temper,\" said the doctor, \"because the big fellow's  night, was disturbed.  Here, what's the matter, Denham?\" he continued,  as they reached the shady pasture where the sleek bullocks were knee  deep in rich grass, evidently laying in a store for emergencies when  fodder might be scarce.  \"Don't say that any of the cattle have  strayed?\"    \"Strayed, sir?  Not they!  They are all right--eight-and-forty of them.  I counted them over twice to make sure, after the night's scare.  My  bullocks are all right.  I only wish I could trust my men as well as I  can them.\"    \"What has happened, then?\"    \"You ask him, sir,\" replied Denham, pointing to the miserable looking  little Hottentot--\"a pretty sort of a half-bred animal!  Look at him  squatting there grinning like one of them there dog-nosed baboons.\"    \"Don't insult the man,\" said the doctor sharply.  \"What has he done?\"    \"Man, sir!  I don't call him a man,\" said Buck Denham.  \"Got nothing to  do but a bit of driving now and then and to give a shout at his span,  and naturally I trusted him as I was keeping my eye on the oxen to keep  his on the two forelopers.  I let him do it because he understands their  lingo better than I do.\"    \"Well?\" said the doctor.  \"What then?\"    \"What then, sir?  Here are we just two days out from the town, and he's  lost one of them already.\"    \"Lost?  Nonsense!\"    \"Well, where is he, then, sir?  He has gone.\"    \"Gone?\"    \"Yes, sir.  Sniffed at his job, I suppose, and gone off.  I saw him safe  enough last night; this morning he is nowhere.  My foreloper he was, and  now we shall have to stop here three or four days, perhaps a week, while  I go back and hunt up another; and I can tell you, sir, they are  precious scarce.\"    \"That's vexatious,\" said the doctor.  \"Don't be put out, Denham, I think  I see how it is.  The poor fellow was no doubt scared by the alarm of  the lion in the night, and very likely we shall see him come creeping in  before it is time to start.\"    \"Oh, thank you, sir,\" said the big fellow.  \"I am very glad you take it  so easy.  Some gen'lemen would be ready to jump down a poor man's throat  for half this.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the doctor, smiling.  \"Well, I don't think you will find  Sir James and me so unreasonable as to bully a good servant for an  unavoidable mishap.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said the big fellow, smiling.  \"That's done me good.  I was afraid to meet you this morning, and I hope you are right, because  we must have two of us to each waggon, and I don't suppose either of  your servants would like to be asked to do such nigger's work.  Hadn't I  better start back at once and get another?  It would save time if I took  one of them ponies.\"    Sir James winced as he looked at the big fellow's proportions, and  glanced uneasily at the doctor, who said, smiling, \"No, we will wait to  see if the man turns up, and if not our two boys shall mount the ponies  and canter back to the station with a note to Captain Lawton asking him  to help us to a fresh foreloper.\"    The man chuckled heartily.    \"Why do you laugh?\" said the doctor.  \"Do you think the captain cannot  be trusted?\"    \"Oh, him, sir,\" replied the man.  \"Cap'n Lawton's a regular gen'leman.  He'd do anything to serve a fellow-countryman.  I was grinning, sir,  because you thought I should be too much for the pony.  Well, I am a big  'un, out and outer; but I growed so.  You are quite right, sir, it would  be rather hard on one of the brave little beasts, and I hope that black  'un will show up again, but I'm afraid of it.  That lion last night  scared him, but he'd be more scared to come and face you gen'lemen  again.\"    Meanwhile, Mark had proposed that they should go to look at the spot  where he stood to fire at his disturber.  This was agreed to, and as  they had to pass Dan Mann, Mark put in a word or two about hurrying on  the breakfast, and told him to be sure to frizzle the bacon well.    \"Ay, ay, sir!\" cried the little fellow, beaming upon them; and they went  on, looked at the ground by daylight, and saw no trace of footprints,  only finding the spot where the unpleasant thorn bush had been crushed  by Mark's fall.    \"Yes,\" said the boy, giving a bit of a writhe and rubbing his back  softly, \"that's where I went down, sure enough, and I believe I have got  another thorn in there now.  My word, how stiff my shoulder is!  I  shan't be in a hurry to fire two barrels of a rifle together again.  Yes, I stood just there when I fired, just as the beast had reared  himself up--itself, I suppose I ought to say, for I don't know whether  it was a cock or a hen--but hallo, where are the ponies?\"    \"Oh, Peter and Bob have taken them down to water, I suppose,\" said Dean.    \"That they haven't.  There they are, over yonder.\"    \"Well, then, Buck Denham must have driven them over there with the  bullocks to have a feed before we start.\"    \"Let's ask Dan.  Here, cooky, where are the ponies?\"    \"Dunno, sir.  They were gone when I came to see to the fire.  I expect  Denham has taken them along with the bullocks.\"    \"Come on, Dean.  Let's go and see how the little fellows look.\"    The boys hurried amongst the trees to where Denham, the Hottentot and  the foreloper were watching the grazing cattle, with the Illaka seated  upon a fallen tree nursing his spear and looking on, while in the  distance, each with his gun over his arm, they could see Sir James and  the doctor, evidently making a circuit of the camp.    \"Ponies, gen'lemen?\" said the big fellow.  \"No, I ain't seen them; I  have been so busy over my bullocks.  Somebody must have taken them down  to the riverside to get a good feed a-piece of that strong reedy grass  that they are so fond of.  You will find them down there.\"    \"Come along,\" cried Mark, and the two boys hurried off in the direction  of the river, threading their way amongst the trees till they caught  sight of the running water sparkling in the rays of the morning sun.    \"There they are,\" cried Mark, \"munching away and regularly enjoying  themselves.  Oh, you beauties!  But hallo!  Who's that chap watching  them?\" and he drew his cousin's attention to a tall, thin, peculiar  looking fellow who was standing close to the water's edge watching the  ponies as if to keep them from going farther along the stream.    The man turned his head as he heard the boys approach, and then looked  back at the ponies and drove one a short distance nearer the camp.    \"Hullo, you!\" cried Mark sharply.  \"What are you doing here?\"    The man shrugged his shoulders, and made a comprehensive sign which  included the four little animals.    \"Yes, I see that,\" said Mark, \"but what do you want here?\"    The man shook his head sadly, and the boys saw that he was very yellow,  as if dried in the sun, and had a particularly thin and peculiar face,  with two long, pendant, yellowish moustachios which reached far beneath  his chin.  His beard was closely clipped, and they noted that he held a  pair of small scissors, and as he drew back one of his twisted  moustachios, he was occupied the while carefully snipping off the  greyish stubble that just showed slightly upon his chin.    \"But how did you come here?\" asked Mark.    \"Walked,\" said the man sadly.    \"When?\"    \"Last--night,\" sighed the stranger, uttering the first word in quite a  high-pitched tone, the second sounding almost like a groan.    He was very shabbily dressed--just an old flannel shirt and a pair of  fustian trousers, while his head was covered by one of the regular,  broad-brimmed, flop felt hats so common amongst Englishmen for  protection from the sun.    \"Well, you are a cheerful looking gentleman,\" thought Mark, and he had  hard work on meeting his cousin's eye to keep from bursting into a fit  of laughter.  Then a sudden thought struck him.    \"When did you say you came here?\"    \"Last--night?\"    \"What time?\"    \"No watch,\" said the man.  \"Quite dark.\"    \"But what did you come for?\"    The man pointed to the ponies, and Mark gazed at his cousin and  whispered, \"I say, I think I have seen this fellow before.\"    \"Hanging about that dealer's yard?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I am sure I did,\" whispered Dean, as the man turned from them to check  the wandering of another of the ponies.    \"Dean,\" said Mark, \"I have got an idea.\"    \"Let's have it.\"    \"That chap has come to steal our ponies.\"    \"Bother!\" cried Dean contemptuously.  \"When did you say you came?\"    \"Last-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#13)"],[1," for the battle.    He knew nothing of women. He did not know, for example, what the  average youth finds out in his teens--that grave eyes and silent  aloofness and lofty self-will and icy pietism in a maiden do not always  signify that she is a saint and that she must be worshiped as such.  Ferris had no one to tell him that far oftener these signs point merely  to stupid narrowness and to lack of ideas.    Dorcas was clever at housework. She was quietly self-assured. She was  good to look upon. She was not like any of the few girls Link had met.  Wherefore he built for her a sacred shrine in his innermost heart; and  he knelt before her image there.    If Ferris found her different from the other Hampton girls, Dorcas  found him equally different from the local swains she knew. She  recognized his hidden strength. The maternal element in her nature  sympathized with his loneliness and with the marks it had left upon his  soul.    For the rest--he was neither a village cut-up like Con Skerly, nor a  solemn mass of conceit like Royal Crews; nor patronizing like young  Lawyer Wetherell; nor vaguely repulsive like old Cap'n Baldy Todd, who  came furtively a-courting her. Link was different. And she liked him.  She liked him more and more.    Once her parents took Dorcas and her five-year-old sister, Olive, on a  Sunday afternoon ramble, which led eventually to the Ferris farm. Link  welcomed the chance callers gladly, and showed them over the place.  Dorcas's housewifely eye rejoiced in the well-kept house, even while  she frowned inwardly at its thousand signs of bachelor inefficiency.  The stock and the crops, too, spoke of solid industry.    But she shrank back in sudden revolt as a huge tawny collie came  bounding toward her from the fold where he had just marshaled the sheep  for the night. The dog was beautiful. And he meant her no harm. He even  tried shyly to make friends with the tall and grave-eyed guest. Dorcas  saw all that. Yet she shrank from him with instinctive fear--in spite  of it.    As a child she had been bitten--and bitten badly--by a nondescript  mongrel that had been chased into the Chatham backyard by a crowd of  stone-throwing boys, and which she had sought to oust with a stick from  its hiding place under the steps. Since then Dorcas had had an  unconquerable fear and dislike of dogs. The  feeling was unconquerable  because she had made no effort to conquer it. She had henceforth judged  all dogs by the one whose teeth marks had left a lifelong scar on her  white forearm.    She had the good breeding not to let Ferris see her distaste for his  pet that he was just then exhibiting so proudly to the guests. Her  shrinking was imperceptible, even to a lover's solicitous eye. But Chum  noted it. And with a collie's odd sixth sense he knew this intruder did  not like him.    Not that her aversion troubled Chum at all; but it puzzled him. People  as a rule were effusively eager to make friends with Chum. And--being  ultraconservative, like the best type of collie--he found their  handling and other attentions annoying. He had taken a liking to  Dorcas, at sight. But since she did not return this liking Chum was  well content to keep away from her.    He was the more content, because five-year-old Olive had flung herself,  with loud squeals of rapture, bodily on the dog; and had clasped her  fat little arms adoringly round his massive furry throat in an ecstasy  of delight.    Chum had never before been brought into such close contact with a  child. And Link watched with some slight perturbation the baby's  onslaught. But in a moment Ferris's mind was at rest.    At first touch of the baby's fingers the collie had become once and for  all Olive's slave. He fairly reveled in the discomfortingly tight  caress. The tug of the little hands in his sensitive neck fur was bliss  to him. Wiggling all over with happiness he sought to lick the chubby  face pressed so tight against his ruff. From that instant  Chum had a  divided allegiance. His human god was Ferris. But this fluffy  pink-and-white youngster was a mighty close second in his list of  deities.    Dorcas looked on, trembling with fear; as her little sister romped with  the adoring dog. And she heaved a sigh of relief when at last they were  clear of the farm without mishap to the baby. For Olive had been dearer  to Dorcas, from birth, than anyone or anything else on earth. To the  baby sister alone Dorcas ceased to be the grave-eyed and self-assured  Lady of Quality, and became a meek and worshiping devotee.    When Link Ferris at last mustered courage to ask Dorcas Chatham to  marry him his form of proposal would have been ruled out of any novel  or play. It consisted chiefly of a mouthful of half-swallowed,  half-exploded words, spoken all in one panic breath, to the  accompaniment of a mortal fear that shook him to the marrow.    Any other words, thus mouthed and gargled, would have required a full  college of languages to translate them. But the speech was along a line  perfectly familiar to every woman since Eve. And Dorcas understood. She  would have understood had Link voiced his proposal in the Choctaw  dialect instead of a slurringly mumbled travesty on English.    The man's stark earnestness of entreaty sent a queer flutter to the  very depths of her calm soul. But the flutter failed to reach or to  titillate the steady eyes. Nor did it creep into the level and  self-possessed voice, as Dorcas made quiet answer:    \"Yes. I like you better than any other man I know. And I'll marry you,  if you're perfectly sure you care for me that way.\"    No, it was not the sort of reply Juliet made to the same question. It  is more than doubtful that Cleopatra answered thus, when Antony offered  to throw away the world for her sake. But it was a wholly correct and  self-respecting response. And Dorcas had been rehearsing it for nearly  a week.    Moreover, words are of use, merely as they affect their hearers. And  all the passion poetry of men and of angels could not have thrilled  Link Ferris as did Dorcas's correct and demure assent to his frenziedly  gabbled plea. It went through the lovesick man's brain and heart like  the breath of God.    And thus the couple became engaged.    With only a slight diminishing of his earlier fear did Link seek out  Old Man Chatham to obtain his consent to the match. Dizzy with joy and  relief he listened to that village worthy's ungracious assent also  secretly rehearsed for some days.    For the best part of a month thereafter Link Ferris floated through a  universe of roseate lights and soft music.    Then came the jar of awakening.    It was one Saturday evening, a week or so before the date set for the  wedding. Dorcas broached a theme which had been much in her mind since  the beginning of the engagement. She approached it very tactfully  indeed, leading up to it in true feminine fashion by means of a  cunningly devised series of levels which would have been the despair of  a mining engineer. Having paved the way she remarked carelessly:    \"John Iglehart was at the store to-day, father says. He's crazy about  that big collie of yours.\"    Instantly Link was full of glad interest. It had been a sorrow to him  that Dorcas did not like dogs. She had explained her dislike--purely on  general principles--early in their acquaintance, and had told him of  its origin. Link was certain she would come to love Chum, on intimate  acquaintance. In the interim he did not seek to force her liking by  bringing the collie to the Chatham house when he called.    Link did not believe in crossing a bridge until he came to it. There  would be plenty of time for Dorcas to make friends with Chum in the  long and happy days to come. Yet, now, he rejoiced that she herself  should have been the first to broach the subject.    \"Father says John is wild about Chum,\" went on the girl unconcernedly;  adding, \"By the way, John asked father to tell you he'd be glad to pay  you $100 for the dog. It's a splendid offer, isn't it! Think of all the  things we can get for the house with $100, Link! Why, it seems almost  providential, doesn't it? Father says John is in earnest about it too.  He--\"    \"In earnest, hey!\" snapped Ferris, finding his voice after an instant  of utter amazement. \"In EARNEST! Well, that's real grand of him, ain't  it! I'd be in earnest, too, if I was to bid ten cents for the best farm  in Passaic County. But the feller who owned the farm wouldn't be in  earnest. He'd be taking it as a fine joke. Like I do, when Johnny  Iglehart has the nerve to offer $100 for a dog that wouldn't be worth a  cent less'n $600--even if he was for sale. Why, that collie of mine--\"    \"If he is worth $600,\" suggested Dorcas icily, \"you'd better not lose  any time before you find someone who will pay that for him. He's no use  to us. And $600 is  too much money to carry on four legs.  He--\"    \"No use to us?\" echoed Link. \"Why, Chum's worth the pay of a hired man  to me, besides all the fondness I've got for him! He handles the sheep,  and he--\"    \"So you've told me,\" interposed Dorcas with no show of interest. \"I  remember the first few times you came to see me you didn't talk of  anything else, hardly, except that dog. Everybody says the same thing.  It's a joke all through Hampton, the silly way you're forever singing  his praises.\"    \"Why shouldn't I?\" demanded Link sturdily. \"There's not a dandier,  better pal anywhere, than what Chum's been to me. He--\"    \"Yes, yes,\" assented Dorcas, \"I know. I don't doubt it. But, after all,  he's only a dog, you know. And if you can get a good price for him, as  you say, then the only thing to do is to sell him. In hard times  like  these--\"    \"Times ain't hard,\" denied Link tersely. \"And Chum ain't for sale.  That's all there is to it.\"    If one of her father's sleek cart horses had suddenly walked out of its  stall with a shouted demand that it be allowed to do the driving,"]]]
