Thomas, Esq., and his overseer, Mr. Parker,       murdered near Port Sorell, by a mob of natives, whilst, actuated by       the most humane views, they were endeavouring to carry the       conciliatory measures of government into effect. Mr. Thomas had       received ten spear wounds, and Mr. Parker eleven. Stocker's hut       desperately attacked; a child wounded; a man, named Cubit, speared.       22nd. Mr. Dawson's hut, on Brushy Plains, attacked, and his servant       severely beaten with waddies. 23rd. Mr. Dawson's servant, Hughes,       severely beaten by natives, nearly losing his life.         October 3rd. The natives, having possession of fire-arms, attacked       and robbed the premises of constable Bird, and plundered the house       of Mr. Amos, jun.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 14: In the western districts, the stockmen were usually  mounted. When they saw the natives, these armed murderers galloped after  them, and delivered their fire without danger to themselves.    An estate is called \"_Quambys_:\" the name is a cry of distress and  entreaty, and signifies, _spare me!_. It was uttered by a black, who was  found there, when imploring compassion; as the supplication is  remembered, perhaps not then in vain: but mercy was rarely shown. A  volunteer party discovered a tribe in a valley, surrounded by steep  mountains; from the heights they poured down a volley of musketry, and  then heaped the slain on the ashes of their fires. Another party  overtook a tribe who had displayed a hostile spirit: they were on the  banks of a lagoon, and all around were plains; escape was hopeless. They  rushed into the water; as their heads rose above the surface, they were  shot. These are specimens which rest on authority not to be disputed.    The slaughter of thirty aborigines, in 1838, at a remote station in New  Holland, instanced the cool deliberation with which they were too often  sacrificed. The deed was planned several days before, and the leisure of  the sabbath was employed for its perpetration. The seven murderers had  been all prisoners of the crown: a subscription was made for their  defence; but in spite of strong sympathy in their behalf, they were  sentenced to death, and ultimately executed. There had been no  provocation: being on horseback, they surrounded the natives, who were  reposing beside their evening fires. These ran to the hut of one of the  assassins, with whom they had lived on terms of amity. There they were  bound, and, amidst their groans, cries, and tears--men, and women with  children at the breast--they were led off to a spot selected for the  immolation. Great pains were taken to conceal the crime; but through a  fall of rain the day preceding, their tracks were visible, and birds of  prey attracted attention to the slaughter! The strongest suspicion  existed, that the murderers were the miserable agents of persons still  more guilty.]    [Footnote 15: The Aborigines' Committee observed, \"that an opinion was  gaining ground in the colony, that small parties should be formed by the  settlers, for the extirpation of the blacks; an idea, which they  contemplated with horror.\" It was more than an opinion--it was a  terrible reality.]    [Footnote 16: _Hobart Town Courier._]        SECTION VI.    Efforts of conciliation, were made through the medium of three women,  captured by the police; and who, after being treated with kindness, were  permitted to return to their tribe, and to invite their submission. One  of these was seen in the journey, and slain, in error! After the absence  of a few weeks, the survivors prevailed on the chief, and nine other men  of the tribe, to accompany them to the residence of Mr. Batman: this  gentleman, and his family, assiduously cultivated their good will, being  one of the few who entertained a strong confidence in the power of  kindness; notwithstanding, after remaining nine days, they eloped, it is  said laden with plunder--displaying, in their progress, unmitigated  hostility. Two natives, who delivered themselves up to a shepherd, and  were lodged in the penitentiary at Launceston, after being supplied with  abundance of food and clothing, within a month effected their escape,  and were traced by their outrages. The celebrated chief, Eumarrah,  captured by Robertson, after two years detention, when his artless  manner and apparent reconciliation to his lot, threw his keepers off  their guard, contrived to abscond. Justice is, however, due to the  reputation of a savage. Eumarrah, afterwards complained, that when  employed on the LINE, he was beaten by a constable: Jemmy, who escaped  at the same time, had been chained to a bench all night, by a similar  functionary. The newspapers of the day complain, that in gaol food  sufficient for their appetites had not been always supplied them. The  women were declining in health, when allowed their liberty. This last,  was the great cause of their restlessness; they felt the oppression of  civilisation; they were weary of clothing; the skin was irritated. The  instinct which prompts a bird to seek some way of exit, also moves a  savage: it was not so much indifference to kindness, as the passion for  roaming--the habit of the race. Nor were they managed always with  prudence: they were left to the mischievous influence of low white men,  who delighted to terrify, even when they did not positively injure them.  It was not until thirty had escaped, nearly equal to the whole number  taken, that it was discovered, that to retain them, even their  prejudices required tenderness, and that they were deeply sensible of  contempt.    These retreats tended to extinguish the hopes cherished by the friends  of the natives, and rooted the conviction more firmly in the colonial  mind, that all efforts to tame them were unavailing. All the plans laid  down for their expulsion, had been tried, and had proved to be  impracticable. They still recurred to their usual haunts, and made up  for their diminished numbers by their improved method, cunning, and  audacity. Having committed depredations, they retired, with their  plunder, to the districts reserved for their occupation, and whither it  was unlawful to follow them, except for sworn offences. The Governor  determined to try a movement, _en masse_, and by the united force of the  entire population, to drive the Austral tribes within Tasman's  Peninsula--a territory, joined to the main land by a neck, about one  quarter of a mile in breadth. The success of this plan could never have  been considered very promising. The Governor expressed his doubt  respecting the result, while it was in progress; and there is no reason  to question that, in putting it to the test, he was moved by the earnest  entreaties of the colonists, and a conviction that nothing should be  left untried, to preserve the people committed to his charge.    On the 7th September, 1830, the intention of the Governor was officially  announced. Referring to the outrages of the natives, he asserted that  their expulsion was impossible, but by a simultaneous effort. He called  on every settler, whether residing in the town or country, to place  himself under the direction of a magistrate, whoever he might prefer;  that the whole military and police strength, combined with such  assistance, might capture the hostile tribes, or permanently expel them.  The solemnity of the engagement, no less than the preservation of the  lives and property of the whole community, would require a serious and  resolute co-operation. On former occasions, he observed such campaigns  had been greatly perverted, and transformed into amusement and  recreation. The Governor gave no promise of recompense, and insisted  that the effort, however meritorious, was simply the duty of all; but  with his accustomed tact, he chose this moment to reward, with large  grants of land, those persons already distinguished for enterprise and  success, and to distribute indulgences to prisoners who had been  actively employed in the service. Mr. Batman, who had devoted twelve  months to the pursuit of the blacks, obtained 2,000 acres of land. Mr.  Howel, of the Clyde, whose losses had been great, but who was  represented as displaying an untiring spirit of humanity, was consoled  with 1,000 acres. The aboriginal Sydney guides, and Black Bill, a  Tasmanian, received each 100 acres.    The volunteer parties from Hobart Town, were to join the force at New  Norfolk, the Clyde, or Richmond: those from Launceston, were to patrol  the westward and Norfolk Plains, the west bank of the Tamar, or the  country extending from Ben Lomond to George Town. Enterprising young  men, inured to the bush, were requested to attach themselves to the  small military parties at the out stations, and, under military  officers, to scour the northern country.    Men, holding tickets-of-leave, were required to enrol under the  magistrate of their district, and settlers were enjoined to equip and  detach whatever servants they could spare, reserving only sufficient  strength for the protection of their families. The inhabitants of Hobart  Town, in public meeting assembled, tendered their service to the  government, for the furtherance of the object. The peace-loving Joseph  Hone, Esq., was chairman of this warlike meeting: most of the leading  speakers belonged to the profession of the gown. Mr. Kemp, one of the  elder colonists, once an officer of the 102nd regiment, who had seen the  process of extermination throughout, declared that the English were  chiefly the agressors. Dr. Turnbull contrasted the effects of a vigorous  resistance by government and the conflict of individuals: united effort  might be followed by bloodshed, but would tend to repress the habits of  violence, and, at least, save a remnant from destruction. A tribe, one  hundred and sixty strong four years before, that frequented the  Elizabeth River, was reduced to sixty by daily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#13)"],[1,"effect: \"May the might of  Krishna accompanied by Samkarshana increase!\" Another (on VI. iii. 6)  speaks of \"Janardana with himself as fourth,\" that is to say, Krishna  with three companions: the three may be Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and  Aniruddha, or they may not. Another verse (on II. ii. 34) speaks of  musical instruments being played at meetings in the temples of Rama and  Kesava. Rama is Bala-rama or Bala-bhadra, who is the same as  Samkarshana, and Kesava is a title of Krishna, which was applied also to  Vishnu or Narayana according to the Bodhayana-dharma-sutra, which may be  assigned to the second century B.C. The Ovavai, or Aupapatika-sutra, a  Jain scripture which may perhaps belong to the same period, mentions (Sec.  76) _Kanha-parivvaya_, wandering friars who worshipped Krishna. Thus  literature as well as inscriptions shows that Krishna Vasudeva and his  brother Samkarshana were in many places worshipped as saints of a church  of Vishnu-Narayana about 150 B.C., and that in some parts Vasudeva was  recognised as the Almighty himself about 200 B.C.    [Footnote 27: R. Chanda, _ut supra_, p. 169 f.]    In another passage (on III. i, 26) Patanjali describes dramatic and  mimetic performances representing the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva.  Altogether his references show that the legend and worship of Vasudeva  bulked largely in the popular mind at this time in India north of the  Vindhya mountains. Vasudeva was adored as the great teacher and  hero-king, in whom the gods Vishnu and Narayana were incarnated; and  he was associated with two great cycles of legend, the one that  related his birth at Mathura, his victory over the tyrant Kamsa, his  establishment of the colony at Dvaraka, and his adventures until his  death and translation to heaven, and the other telling of his share in  the Great War as ally of the five Pandava brethren. Both cycles  represented him as supported by princely heroes. The Mathura-Dvaraka  legend gave him his brother Bala-bhadra or Samkarshana, his son  Pradyumna, and his grandson Aniruddha, whom theologians about the  beginning of the Christian era fitted into their philosophical schemes  by representing them as successive emanations from him; and the  Mahabharata furnished him with the Pandavas, whose heroic tale soon  created for them a worship everywhere. As we have seen, there were  adorers of Arjuna already in the fifth century B.C.; and in the first  century B.C. there seems to be evidence for a worship of all the five  together with Vasudeva, for an inscription has been found at Mora  which apparently mentions a son of the great Satrap Rajuvula,  probably the well-known Satrap Sodasa, and an image of the \"Lord  Vrishni,\" probably Vasudeva, and of the \"Five Warriors.\"[28] Already  the poets of the Mahabharata have taken the first step towards the  deification of the Pandavas by finding divine fathers for each of  them, making Yudhishthira the son of Dharma or Yama, the god of the  nether world, Arjuna son of Indra, Bhima son of Vayu the Wind-god, and  Nakula and Sahadeva offspring of the Asvins. Hundreds of caverns  throughout India are declared by popular legend to have been their  dwellings during their wanderings; and a noble monument to their  memory has been raised by one of the great Pallava kings of Conjevaram  who in the seventh century A.D. carved out of the solid rock on the  seashore at Mamallapuram the fine chapels that bear their names.  Doubtless all these heroes from both cycles were once worshipped in  the usual manner, with offerings of food, incense, lights, flowers,  etc., and singing of hymns on their exploits--chiefly in connection  with Vasudeva; but all this worship is now utterly forgotten, except  where echoes of it linger in popular legend.    [Footnote 28: R. Chandra, _ut supra_, p. 165 f.]    Our survey of the religion of Vasudeva has brought us down to a date  which cannot indeed be exactly fixed, but which may be placed  approximately in the second century of our era. This religion, as we  have seen, arose and grew great in the fertile soil of the spiritual  needs and experiences of India. It began by moulding a personal God  out of ancient figures of myth and legend, and it surrounded him with  a hierarchy of godly heroes. Though its doctrines were often  philosophically incongruous and incoherent, its foundation was a true  religious feeling; it gave scope to the mystic raptures of the ascetic  and the simple righteousness of the laic; and it claimed for its  heroes, Vasudeva and his kindred and his friends the Pandava brethren,  a grave and dignified hero-worship. In short, it is a serious Indian  religion with an epic setting.    And now suddenly and most unexpectedly an utterly new spirit begins to  breathe in it. To the old teachings and legends are added new ones of  a wholly different cast. The old epic spirit of grave and manly  chivalry and godly wisdom is overshadowed by a new passion--adoration  of tender babyhood and wanton childhood, amorous ecstasies, a hectic  fire of erotic romance.    Of this new spirit there is no trace in the epic, except in one or two  late interpolations. But the Hari-vamsa, which was added as an  appendix to the Mahabharata not very long before the fourth century  A.D., is already instinct with it. It adds to the epic story of  Krishna a fluent verse account of his miraculous preservation from  Kamsa at his birth, his childhood among the herdsmen and herdswomen  of Vraja (the Doab near Mathura) with its marvellous freaks and  wonderful exploits, his amorous sports with the herdswomen, in fact  all the sensuous emotionalism on which the later church of Krishna has  ever since battened. About the same time appeared the Vishnu-purana,  which includes most of the same matter as the Hari-vamsa; and some  centuries later, probably about the tenth century, there was written a  still more remarkable book, the Bhagavata-purana, of which a great  part is taken up with the romance of Krishna's babyhood and childhood,  and especially his amorous sports. In the Bhagavata the later worship  of Krishna found its classic expression. In the Hari-vamsa and  Vishnu-purana religious emotion is still held under a certain  restraint; but in the Bhagavata it has broken loose and runs riot. It  is a romance of ecstatic love for Krishna, who is no longer, as in the  Vishnu-purana, the incarnation of a portion of the Supreme Vishnu, but  very God become man, wholly and utterly divine in his humanity. It  dwells in a rapture of tenderness upon the God-babe, and upon the  wanton play of the lovely child who is delightful in his naughtiness  and marvellous in his occasional displays of superhuman power; it  figures him as an ideal of boyish beauty, decked with jewels and  crested with peacock's feathers, wandering through the flowering  forests of Vraja, dancing and playing on his flute melodies that fill  the souls of all that hear them with an irresistible passion of love  and delight; it revels in tales of how the precocious boy made wanton  sport with the herdswomen of Vraja, and how the magic of his fluting  drew them to the dance in which they were united to him in a rapture  of love. The book thrills with amorous, sensuous ecstasy; the thought  of Krishna stirs the worshipper to a passion of love in which tears  gush forth in the midst of laughter, the speech halts, and often the  senses fail and leave him in long trances. Erotic emotionalism can go  no further.    Where did this new spirit come from? Some have laboured to prove that  it had its source in Christianity; others have argued that it was  Christianity that was the debtor to India in this respect. Both  theories are in the main impossible. This cult of the child Krishna  arose in India, and, with the possible exception of a few obscure  tales, it never spread outside the circle of Indian religion. But how  and where did it arise? That is a question hard to answer; there is no  direct evidence, and we can only balance probabilities. Now what are  the probabilities?    The worship of Krishna as a babe, a boy, and a young man among the  herdsfolk of Vraja seems to have no relation with the older form of  the religion as set forth in the epic textbooks. It is a new element,  imported from without. The most natural conclusion then is that it  came from the people who are described in it, some tribe that pastured  their herds in the woodlands near Mathura. Perhaps these herdsfolk  were Abhiras, ancestors of the modern Ahir tribes. If so, it would be  natural that their cult should attract attention; for sometimes  Abhiras counted for something in society, and we even find a  short-lived dynasty of Abhira kings reigning in Nasik in the third  century A.D.[29] Be this as it may, it seems very likely that some  pastoral tribe had a cult of a divine child blue or black of hue, and  perhaps actually called by them Krishna or Kanha, \"Black-man\" (observe  that henceforth Krishna is regularly represented with a blue skin), a  cult in which gross rustic fantasy had free play; that it came in some  circles to be linked on to the epic cycle of Krishna Vasudeva; and  that some Bhagavatas, seeing in it latent possibilities, gave it  polished literary expression and thereby established it as a part of  the Vasudeva legend. It quickly seized upon the popular imagination  and spread like wild-fire over India. For it satisfied many needs. The  tenderness of the father and still more of the mother for the little  babe, their delight in the sports of childhood, the amorist's pleasure  in erotic adventure, and, not by any means least, the joy in the  romantic scenery of the haunted woodlands--all these instincts found  full play in it, and were sanctified by religion.
