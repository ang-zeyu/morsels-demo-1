XIV                   HOW OLD MR. TREE TOAD FOUND OUT HOW TO CLIMB                                           XIV                   HOW OLD MR. TREE TOAD FOUND OUT HOW TO CLIMB      Of all the puzzling things over which Peter Rabbit had sat and thought  and wondered until the brains in that funny little head of his were  topsy-turvy, none was more puzzling than the fact that Sticky-toes the  Tree Toad could climb. Often Peter had watched him climb up the trunk of  a tree or jump from one branch to another and then thought of Old Mr.  Toad, own cousin to Sticky-toes, and of Grandfather Frog, another own  cousin, who couldn't climb at all, and wondered how it had all come  about that one cousin could climb and be just as much at home in the  trees as the birds, while the others couldn't climb at all.    He had it on his mind one morning when he met Old Mr. Toad solemnly  hopping down the Lone Little Path. Right then and there Peter resolved  to ask Old Mr. Toad. \"Good morning, Mr. Toad,\" said Peter politely.  \"Have you a few minutes to spare?\"    Old Mr. Toad hopped into the shade of a big mullein leaf. \"I guess so,  if it is anything important,\" said he. \"Phew! Hot, isn't it? I simply  can't stand the sun. Now what is that you've got on your mind, Peter?\"    Peter hesitated a minute, for he wasn't at all sure that Old Mr. Toad  would think the matter sufficiently important for him to spend his time  in story telling. Then he blurted out the whole matter and how he had  puzzled and puzzled why Sticky-toes was able to climb when none of the  rest of the Toad family could. Old Mr. Toad chuckled.    \"Looking for a story as usual, I see,\" said he. \"You ought to go to  Grandfather Frog for this one, because Sticky-toes is really a Frog and  not a Toad. But we are all cousins, and I don't mind telling you about  Sticky-toes, or rather about his great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather,  who was the first of the family ever to climb a tree. You see, it is all  in the family, and I am very proud of my family, which is one of the  very oldest.\"    Peter settled himself comfortably and prepared to listen. Old Mr. Toad  snapped up a foolish spider who came too near and then cleared his  throat.    \"Once on a time,\" he began, \"when Old Mother Nature made the first land  and the first trees and plants, the Toads and the Frogs were the first  to leave the water to see what dry land was like. The Toads, being  bolder than the Frogs, went all over the new land while the Frogs kept  within jumping distance of the water, just as Grandfather Frog does to  this day. There was one Frog, however, who, seeing how bravely and  boldly the Toads went forth to see all that was to be seen in the new  land, made up his mind that he too would see the Great World. He was the  smallest of the Frogs, and his friends and relatives warned him not to  go, saying that he would come to no good end.    \"But he wouldn't listen to their dismal croakings and hurried after the  Toads. Being able to make longer jumps than they could, he soon caught  up with them, and they all journeyed on together. The Toads were so  pleased that one of their cousins was brave enough to join them that  they made him very welcome and treated him as one of themselves, so that  they soon got to thinking of him as a Toad and not as a Frog at all.    \"Now the Toads soon found that Old Mother Nature was having a hard time  to make plants grow, because as fast as they came up, they were eaten by  insects. You see, she had so many things to attend to in those days when  the world was young that she had to leave a great many things to take  care of themselves and get along the best they could, and it was this  way with the plants. It was then that the great idea came to my  great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather, and he called all the Toads  together and proposed that they help Old Mother Nature by catching the  bugs and worms that were destroying the plants.    \"Little Mr. Frog, who had been adopted by the Toads, was one of the most  eager to help, and he was busy every minute. After a while the Toads had  caught most of the bugs and worms on the ground and within reach, and  the plants began to grow. But when the plants got above the reach of the  Toads, the bugs and the worms were safe once more and began to multiply  so that the plants suffered and stopped growing. You see, there were no  birds in those days to help. One day little Mr. Frog sat under a bush on  which most of the leaves had been eaten. He saw a worm eating a leaf on  one of the lower branches. It was quite a way above his head. It worried  him. He kept his eyes on that worm and thought and thought until his  head ached. At last he got an idea. 'I wonder,' thought he, 'if I jump  as hard as I can, if I can catch that fellow. I'll try it. It will do  no harm to try.'    \"So he drew his long legs close under him, and then he jumped up with  all his might. He didn't quite reach the bug, but he got his hands on  the branch and by pulling and struggling, he managed to get up on it. It  was a very uncertain seat, but he hung on and crept along until he could  dart his tongue out and catch that worm. Then he saw another, and in  trying to catch that one he lost his balance and fell to the ground with  a thump. It quite knocked the wind from his body.    \"That night little Mr. Frog studied and studied, trying to think of some  way by which he could get up in the bushes and trees and clear them of  bugs and worms. 'If only I could hold on once I get up there, I would be  all right,' thought he. 'Then I could leave the bugs and worms on the  ground for my cousins the Toads to look after, while I look after those  beyond their reach.'    \"The next day and the next, and for many days thereafter, little Mr.  Frog kept jumping for bugs on the bushes. He got many thumps and bumps,  but he didn't mind these, for little by little he was learning how to  hang on to the branches once he got up in them. Then one day, just by  accident, he put one hand against the trunk of a young pine-tree, and  when he started to take it away, he found it stuck fast. He had to pull  to get it free. Like a flash an idea popped into his head. He rubbed a  little of the pitch, for that was what had made his hand stick, on both  hands, and then he started to climb a tree. As long as the pitch lasted,  he could climb.    \"Little Mr. Frog was tickled to death, with his discovery, but he didn't  say a word to any one about it. Every day he rubbed pitch on his hands  and then climbed about in the bushes and low trees, ridding them of bugs  and worms. Of course, it wasn't very pleasant to have that pitch on his  hands, because dirt and all sorts of things which he happened to touch  stuck to them, but he made the best of a bad matter and washed them  carefully when he was through with his day's work.    \"Quite unexpectedly Old Mother Nature returned to see how the trees and  the plants were getting on. You see, she was worried about them. When  she found what the Toads had been doing, she was mightily pleased. Then  she noticed that some of the bushes and low trees had very few leaves  left, while others looked thrifty and strong.    \"'That's queer,' said Old Mother Nature to herself and went over to  examine a bush. Hanging on to a branch for dear life she saw a queer  little fellow who was so busy that he didn't see her at all. It was  little Mr. Frog. He was catching bugs as fast as he could. Old Mother  Nature wrinkled up her brows. 'Now however did he learn to climb?'  thought she. Then she hid where she could watch. By and by she saw  little Mr. Frog tumble out of the bush, because, you know, the pitch on  his hands had worn off. He hurried over to a pine-tree and rubbed more  pitch on and then jumped up into the bush and went to work again.    \"You can guess how astonished Old Mother Nature was when she saw this  performance. And she was pleased. Oh, yes, indeed, Old Mother Nature  was wonderfully pleased. She was pleased because little Mr. Frog was  trying so hard to help her, and she was pleased because he had been so  smart in finding a way to climb. When she had laughed until she could  laugh no more at the way little Mr. Frog had managed to stick to his  work, she took him down very gently and wiped the pitch from his hands.  Then she gently pinched the end of each finger and each toe so that they  ended in little round discs instead of being pointed as before, and in  each little disc was a clean, sticky substance. Then she tossed him up  in a tree, and when he touched a branch, he found that he could hold on  without the least danger of falling.    \"'I appoint you caretaker of my trees,' said Old Mother Nature, and from  that day on little Mr. Frog lived in the trees, as did his children and  his children's children, even as Sticky-toes does to-day. And though he  was really a Frog, he was called the Tree Toad, and the Toads have  always been proud to have him so called. And this is the end of the  story,\" concluded Old Mr. Toad.                                           XV                       HOW OLD MR.

But you found the bush was dismal and a land of no delight,     Did you chance to hear a chorus in the shearers' huts at night?     Did they 'rise up, William Riley' by the camp-fire's cheery blaze?     Did they rise him as we rose him in the good old droving days?     And the women of the homesteads and the men you chanced to meet --     Were their faces sour and saddened like the 'faces in the street',     And the 'shy selector children' -- were they better now or worse     Than the little city urchins who would greet you with a curse?     Is not such a life much better than the squalid street and square     Where the fallen women flaunt it in the fierce electric glare,     Where the sempstress plies her sewing till her eyes are sore and red     In a filthy, dirty attic toiling on for daily bread?     Did you hear no sweeter voices in the music of the bush     Than the roar of trams and 'buses, and the war-whoop of 'the push'?     Did the magpies rouse your slumbers with their carol sweet and strange?     Did you hear the silver chiming of the bell-birds on the range?     But, perchance, the wild birds' music by your senses was despised,     For you say you'll stay in townships till the bush is civilised.     Would you make it a tea-garden and on Sundays have a band     Where the 'blokes' might take their 'donahs',       with a 'public' close at hand?     You had better stick to Sydney and make merry with the 'push',     For the bush will never suit you, and you'll never suit the bush.          Last Week           Oh, the new-chum went to the back block run,     But he should have gone there last week.     He tramped ten miles with a loaded gun,     But of turkey or duck he saw never a one,     For he should have been there last week,      They said,     There were flocks of 'em there last week.       He wended his way to a waterfall,     And he should have gone there last week.     He carried a camera, legs and all,     But the day was hot, and the stream was small,     For he should have gone there last week,      They said.     They drowned a man there last week.       He went for a drive, and he made a start,     Which should have been made last week,     For the old horse died of a broken heart;     So he footed it home and he dragged the cart --     But the horse was all right last week,      They said.     He trotted a match last week.       So he asked the bushies who came from far     To visit the town last week,     If they'd dine with him, and they said 'Hurrah!'     But there wasn't a drop in the whisky jar --     You should have been here last week,      He said,     I drank it all up last week!          Those Names           The shearers sat in the firelight, hearty and hale and strong,     After the hard day's shearing, passing the joke along:     The 'ringer' that shore a hundred, as they never were shorn before,     And the novice who, toiling bravely, had tommy-hawked half a score,     The tarboy, the cook, and the slushy, the sweeper that swept the board,     The picker-up, and the penner, with the rest of the shearing horde.     There were men from the inland stations       where the skies like a furnace glow,     And men from the Snowy River, the land of the frozen snow;     There were swarthy Queensland drovers who reckoned all land by miles,     And farmers' sons from the Murray, where many a vineyard smiles.     They started at telling stories when they wearied of cards and games,     And to give these stories a flavour they threw in some local names,     And a man from the bleak Monaro, away on the tableland,     He fixed his eyes on the ceiling, and he started to play his hand.       He told them of Adjintoothbong, where the pine-clad mountains freeze,     And the weight of the snow in summer breaks branches off the trees,     And, as he warmed to the business, he let them have it strong --     Nimitybelle, Conargo, Wheeo, Bongongolong;     He lingered over them fondly, because they recalled to mind     A thought of the old bush homestead, and the girl that he left behind.     Then the shearers all sat silent till a man in the corner rose;     Said he, 'I've travelled a-plenty but never heard names like those.     Out in the western districts, out on the Castlereagh     Most of the names are easy -- short for a man to say.       'You've heard of Mungrybambone and the Gundabluey pine,     Quobbotha, Girilambone, and Terramungamine,     Quambone, Eunonyhareenyha, Wee Waa, and Buntijo --'     But the rest of the shearers stopped him:       'For the sake of your jaw, go slow,     If you reckon those names are short ones out where such names prevail,     Just try and remember some long ones before you begin the tale.'     And the man from the western district, though never a word he said,     Just winked with his dexter eyelid, and then he retired to bed.          A Bush Christening           On the outer Barcoo where the churches are few,      And men of religion are scanty,     On a road never cross'd 'cept by folk that are lost,      One Michael Magee had a shanty.       Now this Mike was the dad of a ten year old lad,      Plump, healthy, and stoutly conditioned;     He was strong as the best, but poor Mike had no rest      For the youngster had never been christened.       And his wife used to cry, 'If the darlin' should die      Saint Peter would not recognise him.'     But by luck he survived till a preacher arrived,      Who agreed straightaway to baptise him.       Now the artful young rogue, while they held their collogue,      With his ear to the keyhole was listenin',     And he muttered in fright, while his features turned white,      'What the divil and all is this christenin'?'       He was none of your dolts, he had seen them brand colts,      And it seemed to his small understanding,     If the man in the frock made him one of the flock,      It must mean something very like branding.       So away with a rush he set off for the bush,      While the tears in his eyelids they glistened --     ''Tis outrageous,' says he, 'to brand youngsters like me,      I'll be dashed if I'll stop to be christened!'       Like a young native dog he ran into a log,      And his father with language uncivil,     Never heeding the 'praste' cried aloud in his haste,      'Come out and be christened, you divil!'       But he lay there as snug as a bug in a rug,      And his parents in vain might reprove him,     Till his reverence spoke (he was fond of a joke)      'I've a notion,' says he, 'that'll move him.'       'Poke a stick up the log, give the spalpeen a prog;      Poke him aisy -- don't hurt him or maim him,     'Tis not long that he'll stand, I've the water at hand,      As he rushes out this end I'll name him.       'Here he comes, and for shame! ye've forgotten the name --      Is it Patsy or Michael or Dinnis?'     Here the youngster ran out, and the priest gave a shout --      'Take your chance, anyhow, wid 'Maginnis'!'       As the howling young cub ran away to the scrub      Where he knew that pursuit would be risky,     The priest, as he fled, flung a flask at his head      That was labelled '_MAGINNIS'S WHISKY_'!       And Maginnis Magee has been made a J.P.,      And the one thing he hates more than sin is     To be asked by the folk, who have heard of the joke,      How he came to be christened 'Maginnis'!          How the Favourite Beat Us           'Aye,' said the boozer, 'I tell you it's true, sir,     I once was a punter with plenty of pelf,     But gone is my glory, I'll tell you the story     How I stiffened my horse and got stiffened myself.       ''Twas a mare called the Cracker, I came down to back her,     But found she was favourite all of a rush,     The folk just did pour on to lay six to four on,     And several bookies were killed in the crush.       'It seems old Tomato was stiff, though a starter;     They reckoned him fit for the Caulfield to keep.     The Bloke and the Donah were scratched by their owner,     He only was offered three-fourths of the sweep.       'We knew Salamander was slow as a gander,     The mare could have beat him the length of the straight,     And old Manumission was out of condition,     And most of the others were running off weight.       'No doubt someone 'blew it', for everyone knew it,     The bets were all gone, and I muttered in spite     'If I can't get a copper, by Jingo, I'll stop her,     Let the public fall in, it will serve the brutes right.'       'I said to the jockey, 'Now, listen, my cocky,     You watch as you're cantering down by the stand,     I'll wait where that toff is and give you the office,     You're only to win if I lift up my hand.'       'I then tried to back her -- 'What price is the Cracker?'     'Our books are all full, sir,' each bookie did swear;     My mind, then, I made up, my fortune I played up     I bet every shilling against my own mare.       'I strolled to the gateway, the mare in the straightway     Was shifting and dancing, and pawing the ground,     The boy saw me enter and wheeled for his canter,     When a darned great mosquito came buzzing around.       'They breed 'em at Hexham, it's risky to vex 'em,     They suck a man dry at a sitting, no doubt,     But just as the mare passed, he fluttered my hair past,     I lifted my hand, and I flattened him out.       'I was stunned when they started, the mare simply darted     Away to the front when the flag was let fall,     For none there could match her, and none tried to catch her --     She finished a furlong in front of them all.       'You bet that I went for the boy, whom I sent for     The moment he weighed and came out of the stand --     'Who paid you to win it?  Come, own up this minute.'     'Lord love yer,' said he, 'why you lifted your hand.'       ''Twas true, by St. Peter, that cursed 'muskeeter'     Had broke me so broke that I hadn't"]]]
