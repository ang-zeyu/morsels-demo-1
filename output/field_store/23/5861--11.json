Commence with the web under the lath A; bring it  between the laths and over B; now take it round the left-hand edge of B,  and round the back and between the laths and over A, continuing this  method of wrapping the laths until the lower end is reached, and then  fastening the webbing as indicated by the dotted lines which represent  the tacks. This self-contained hinge is then fixed to the edges of the  screen by boring suitable holes through the laths and using countersunk  screws. This is a cheap and efficient method of overcoming the  difficulty. A similar method is used for the household clothes horse.    [Illustration: Fig. 245.--Finger Joint Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 246.--The Knuckle Joint Hinge.]    FINGER JOINT HINGE.--Fig. 245 is a finger joint--a movable interlocking  joint used to support the leaf of a Pembroke table. The small portion is  screwed to the table rail and the shaped bracket swings out to support  the drop leaf. The shaded portion of the bracket shows the timber  chamfered away so that the fingers may be easily put behind the bracket  to manipulate it. Note that the corners are slightly rounded off, as  indicated by the black portion of the sketch, and that the mortises are  cut about 1/4 in. deeper than the thickness of the timber used. This  joint has now been almost superseded by a cheap stamped galvanised iron  bracket of exactly the same pattern. The joint, however, is still used  for repair work and in cases where a stamped metal bracket has not  sufficient overhang.    [Illustration: Fig. 247.--Open Joint Hingeing.]    KNUCKLE JOINT HINGE.--Fig. 246 is a similar type of joint to the above,  and is called the knuckle joint. This arrangement of hingeing allows the  table leg to swing in an angle of 180 degrees and is much neater in its  appearance. It is often used to connect a movable table leg to the  framing, where it is necessary for the table leg and rail to swing  outwards and support a drop leaf. The pivot is formed by a piece of  1/8-in. or 1/4-in. round iron rod running through the centre of the  joint.    [Illustration: Fig. 248.--Clearing the Architrave Mould.]    OPEN JOINT HINGEING.--The next three illustrations apply more  particularly to the hanging of the ordinary household door.    Fig. 247 is termed \"open joint hanging,\" from the fact that when the door  is open a certain amount of open space exists between the edge of the  door and the doorpost. This open space varies according to the position  in which the butt hinge is fixed. A section is shown at which the pin of  the hinge is let in level with the face of the door. This will allow the  door to open as shown by the dotted line, and it will not clear the  architrave moulding.    [Illustration: Fig. 249.--Close Joint Hingeing.]    Fig. 248 indicates the position of the hinge fixed so as to allow the  door to open and lay flat back to the architrave moulding. In this  instance the butts are made with wider wings, and they are generally  provided to take three screws (see Fig. 233, right-hand wing of hinge).    To determine the position of the centre pin of the hinge the following  rule is observed. The centre of the pivot pin of the hinge must be _half  the distance_ between the face of the door, when closed, and the outside  of the architrave moulding.    CLOSE JOINT HANGING.--The method known as \"close joint hanging\" ensures  the joint at the hanging stile being in close proximity to the hanging  rail; this is shown at Fig. 249. The first member of the architrave  moulding is generally a bead of the same diameter as the knuckle of the  hinge. The butt hinge is let in as shown in the illustration, and the  door when opened forms a close-fitting joint.    [Illustration: Fig. 250.--Rule Joint Hinge, with Leaf Open.]    THE RULE JOINT HINGE is used to connect the top and the drop leaf of a  table in cases where continuity of design is desired, so that the edge of  the top and the leaf will show an ovolo moulding when the table is either  open or closed. To the inexperienced worker it presents several  difficulties and, if it is a first effort, it is advisable to try out a  sample joint on a couple of odd pieces of timber.    Fig. 250 illustrates the joint when the leaf is opened or in a horizontal  position. At Fig. 252 we have the joint when the leaf is let down to a  vertical position. It should be observed in the latter figure that the  edge A of the drop leaf is in alignment with the axis of the hinge. Steel  or brass back-flap hinges (Fig. 233) are generally used and they are sunk  into the table as suggested.    Set out the work full size as at Fig. 251, and mark point 1, which is to  be the position of the joint. Draw 1, 2, at right angles to the table  top. Mark point 3 on the vertical line for the centre of the hinge, and  mark point 4 approximately as shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 251.--Setting Out for Rule Joint Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 252.--The Rule Joint with Leaf Down.]    With compass point on 3 and radius 3 to 4, describe an arc 4 to 5. This  gives us the true joint line (1, 4, 5). The distance 0 to 3 is usually  determined by the hinge. The knuckle of the back flap hinge is always let  into the under side of the wood and the further it is inserted into the  wood the more the joint will overlap at A (Fig. 252) which shows the  joint when the flap or leaf is down.          SHUTTING JOINTS      This chapter deals with the joint made by the upright rail of a door  frame which carries the lock, or handle, generally called the \"slamming  stile.\" Many and varied are the methods used to make a draught and  air-tight joint at the meeting of the slamming stile and the carcase end,  and our sketches illustrate some of the simplest and also some of the  best and most expensive methods.    [Illustration: Fig. 253.--Shutting Stile of Cupboard Door.]    [Illustration: Fig. 254.--Showing Cupboard End Thicknessed (see B).]    [Illustration: Fig. 255.--Dust-proof Cupboard Door.]    Fig. 253 is a part plan of the end of a simple cupboard of which the  carcase end is all of one thickness (_i.e._, not lined up in thickness).  A small strip of wood (A) is glued and screwed on the end to form a stop  to the door and to prevent the access of dust to the interior of the  cupboard.    Fig. 254 illustrates a similar method; the stop (C) is seen, as in the  previous illustration, but it will be noticed also that the carcase end  in this case is lined up (see B) to give a pilaster-like appearance to  the end, and the moulding is selected on account of its suitability to  hide the joint of the lining piece.    Fig. 255 is of a more intricate type, and is often used on jewellers'  showcases. The end at the right hand is slightly rebated to receive the  frame, and both the rail and the end are grooved with a plough plane. A  separate bead is made and glued into the groove of the door frame (D),  engaging the groove in the carcase end when the door is closed. The  shutting stile and the end are worked with a hook joint (E), and if  carefully made they are practically dust-tight.    [Illustration: Fig. 256.--Meeting Stiles with rebated Astragal.]    [Illustration: Fig. 257.--Door Rebated for Astragal.]    [Illustration: Fig. 258.--Door with Brass Astragal.]    Fig. 256 shows the meeting of two doors which open outwards, a separate  piece of timber being made to form a rebated astragal mould (F) and glued  to the right-hand door. This method gives a neat and effective finish.    Fig. 257 is similar to the above, with the exception that the rail of the  door is rebated (G) to receive the astragal moulding. This method is  preferred on the best class of work, because it shows no unsightly joint  at the inside of the door frame.    Fig. 258 illustrates the type of joint made by using a brass astragal  mould (H) as employed on high-class work, frequently seen on French  furniture of the Louis periods. In Fig. 259 is shown a piece of brass  astragal moulding, which may be procured from any cabinetmaker's  ironmonger in suitable lengths. It is fixed in position by slightly  rebating the edge of the door and fastening with ordinary countersunk  brass screws.    [Illustration: Fig. 259.--Brass Astragal.]    [Illustration: Fig. 260.--Curved Cupboard Doors with Rebated Meeting  Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 261.--Rebated Meeting Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 262.--Meeting Joint with applied Astragal.]    Fig. 260 is a rebated joint, broken at the front by a bead moulding. The  illustration shows its application to a circular-fronted cupboard, and it  will be noticed that the hinged rails are received in a rebate which is  worked on the carcase ends. The rebated joint at the centre of the two  doors is worked slightly on the bevel, so as to allow for clearance when  opening the door.    Two of the commonest meeting joints of doors are seen in Figs. 261 and  262. In the former case the stiles are rebated (as already shown in Fig.  260), whilst at Fig. 262 an astragal bead is glued to the right-hand  stile. In Fig. 261 a bead is worked on the right-hand stile to mask the  joint.    Fig. 263 is the hook joint used on good-class joinery and cabinet work. A  pair of special wood planes are required to make the joint in a cheap and  efficient manner. The cost of a pair of 5/8-in. hook joint planes is from  6_s._ to 8_s._ They are of similar size and general appearance to the  ordinary ovolo moulding plane.    [Illustration: Fig. 263.--The Hook Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 264.--Hook Joint with loose Tongues.]    [Illustration: Fig. 265.--Rebated Joint with Tongue Slip.]    Fig. 264 is a special type of hook joint as used on larger work. The  joint may be made by using the plough plane, the rebate plane and a  suitably-sized bead plane, the loose tongues being inserted as shown and  fastened by screws and glue.

[Sidenote: Sewing Hems]    In sewing the hem, the needle should take up only the edge to be hemmed  down and just enough to hold on the cloth or lining. In white work the  stitches should be fine, showing as little as possible.    [Sidenote: Bias Hem]    All bias and curved edges should have the first fold basted. In cloth or  silk this first basting thread should match the material and not be  taken out.    [Sidenote: Faced hem]    A facing or faced hem is also used as a protection to the edge of a  garment. A true bias or fitted facing should be used for a facing if the  edges of the garment are curved. An extension hem is one in which the  whole width of the hem is used.      [Illustration: HEMMING    _a_--Shows method of cutting to do away with a clumsey corner.]      [Sidenote: Slip-Stitching]    Slip-stitching or invisible hemming is done on silk, wool, and thick  material. The hem is pressed with an iron, a stitch as fine as possible  is taken on the surface of the cloth and the needle slipped under and  through the first fold, drawing the thread lightly. The needle and  thread used in this stitch must be very fine.      [Illustration: MITERED CORNERS    Method of Folding and Cutting.]      [Illustration: ROLLED HEM AND WHIPPED GATHERS    _a_--Rolled Hem Gathered; _b_--Whipped Roll; _c_--Double Whipped;  _d_--Roll Hemmed; _e_--Gathers Sewed to Band.]      [Sidenote: Rolled Hem]    Rolled hem and whipped gathers are made with the wrong side of the  material next the worker. Make a tiny roll of the edge towards the  worker, using the left thumb and index finger, rolling an inch at a time  (and no more) before hemming. Make fine, even stitches in the roll and  goods. Keep the hem perfectly round, firm and not too large. This hem is  adapted only to fine material and the edge across the warp is the more  easily rolled.    [Sidenote: Whipped Gathers]    To gather, whip the rolled hem without hemming, making overcasting  stitches towards you, even and not too fine. Use coarser thread than for  hemming. This gathering thread is used to hold down the edge as well as  for drawing up the gathers and it not to be taken out, as is the  ordinary gathering thread. It should _not_ catch in the roll. Have the  thread the length of the plain space to which it is to be sewed and  regulate the gathers as you do the gathering. After the edge is rolled,  whipped and gathered, it is sewed to the garment by the little scallops  or raised parts made by the whipping. This is used only for making  ruffles or gathering on very fine hand work.    [Sidenote: French Hem]    The French hem is used for table linen. Fold as in an ordinary hem, then  fold the hem back on the right side and overhand the edge formed, taking  fine stitches. Press the hem flat from the right side.    [Sidenote: Flannel Hems]    Flannel hems should _not_ be twice folded, for there will be a ridge  instead of a flat surface after the garment has been laundered, owing to  the felting properties of the wool. Hems on flannel should not be  stitched by hand or machine, but cat stitched on the wrong side and  finished on the right side with any ornamental stitch.    Hems in infants' clothing may be turned on the right side and made  ornamental by feather stitching.    No selvage should ever be used on a hem. The selvage is more closely  woven and will draw or pucker in laundrying.      TUCKS    Tucks are folds made on thin material for ornament, to shorten or to  provide for lengthening a garment. If done by hand, a card measure is  preferable to a tape measure for marking the space and width of the  tucks. The folds should be creased to a thread, basted and sewed with a  running stitch showing but little on the face, or stitched on the  machine. Fine thread should be used.      SEAMS    A seam is the line of sewing that joins material; it may be plain or  ornamental. The most important are the overhand, felled, French, slot,  lapped, flannel, and beaded.    The overhand seam is described under the overhand stitch.    [Sidenote: Felled Seam]    A fell is a seam hemmed down to the goods to protect the raw edge. It is  usually made in night dresses, drawers, corset covers, etc. Baste with  the piece farthest from the worker extended one-eighth of an inch beyond  the other and sewed _with the grain_ of the goods, beginning at the  widest part of any bias. Press the seam with the nail on the right side,  turn the wide edge down flat to cover the raw edge and line of sewing,  and hem flat either by hand or machine. Care should be taken to keep the  seam flat on the right as well as on the wrong side. If the felling is  done with the machine hemmer, the wide edge must be on the opposite  side. The seam may be basted with both edges even if preferred, cutting  off one edge after stitching.      [Illustration: SEAMS    _a_--Full; _b_--French Screen.]      [Illustration: BEADED AND TAPED SEAMS    _A_--Tape basted on one edge, and the other edge turned and stitched;  _B_--Beading whipped to the folded edges; _a_--Stitched hem; _b_--Hem  finished with feather stitching.]      [Sidenote: French Seam]    A French seam is sewed twice--first on the right side as near the raw  edge as possible. Cut off all frayed edges, turn the material by folding  _on the seam_ or line of sewing, so the seam is folded inside and the  second sewing is on the wrong side below the raw edges. This is not a  good seam for underwear worn next the body, as it leaves a ridge on the  wrong side, but it is useful for skirts of thin material, etc. It is  more easily made than a fell.    [Sidenote: Beaded Seam]    Beaded seams used for fine white work have a line of beading overhanded  between gores, hems, or gathers. The hem along the seam should be folded  on the right side, leaving a perfectly flat surface to iron on the wrong  side, and finished with an ornamental stitch covering the hem.    [Sidenote: Slot Seams]    The slot seam, used in cloth dresses and jackets, requires exact basting  with silk or very fine thread with small, even stitches. If a coarse  thread is used, the material will be badly marked. After basting, press  the seam open as if it had been stitched, and baste the strap or under  strip of the dress material (which has been cut perfectly straight and  even) over the wrong side of the seam, having the center of the seam on  the center of the strap. Stitch any width desired beyond the center  through the three thicknesses. This will hold the seam in position. Now  remove the bastings from the seam and the slot effect is complete. If  desired, there may be a double row of stitching, an extra row on the  edge of the fold or plait. These seams may be finished at the bottom  with arrow heads or stitched designs. The lines of machine stitching  should not end without some ornament to _appear_ to hold the plait.      [Illustration: SLOT SEAM FINISHED WITH ARROW HEAD]      [Illustration: FLANNEL SEAMS AND HEMS    Finished with various Ornamental Stitches.]      [Sidenote: Lapped Seam]    In the lapped seam the edges are folded each within the other or one  over the other so that both sides are alike. If made of heavy material,  the raw edges are left unturned; in muslin or linen the edges are  inturned, lapped, basted and the hem stitched on both edges or hemmed  down on both sides by hand.      [Illustration: PLACKETS    _A_--Made by folding a wide hem over a narrow one; _B_--Tape faced  sewing for the purpose of a gusset. Method of folding the tape shown.]      [Sidenote: Flannel Seams]    Flannel seams should be stitched, opened and pressed _flat_, either on  the right or wrong side of the garment. If on the right side, taffeta  ribbon should be basted over the seam, so that the raw edges of flannel  will not show, and cat stitched or buttonhole stitched on both sides of  the ribbon, or any fancy stitch--not too long--may be used. This is the  Dorothy seam. For the seam on the wrong side, the edges should be cat  stitched with fine thread. Any ornamental stitch may be used on the  right side of the seam. Always press flannel seams and hems before  finishing. Flannel should never be hem stitched.      PLACKETS    A placket is an opening in a garment allowing it to be put on. The  simplest placket is made by cutting a slit and folding a wide hem over a  narrow one turned on the face of the goods; this makes a pleat below the  vent. There should be a double line of stitching across the bottom of  the hem to strengthen the placket.    [Sidenote: Tape Faced Placket]    The tape faced placket is stronger and may be used in children's  drawers, etc., in place of a gusset to strengthen the end of the  opening. A single piece of tape folded back as for a loop is stitched  along all edges, making an opening without a lap. This offers as much  resistance as a gusset and is more quickly done.      [Illustration: FACED PLACKET    _A_--Wrong side, opened, showing tape; _B_--Right side showing on-set  piece; _aa_ and _bb_ the same ends of the tape; 1-2 method of folding  and cutting end of on-set piece.]      [Sidenote: Faced Placket]    In a third kind of placket, the opening is faced with a continuous piece  of tape on both sides and finished with a piece of material on the  outside. See illustration. This makes a strong and simple placket. When  a tape cannot be used, a hem or facing may be made on the under side of  the opening and a facing on the upper side, over which the on-set piece  is stitched. The on-set piece and facing may be cut from one piece, but  the fitting is more troublesome. In figured goods, the piece set on  should match the pattern exactly.      [Illustration: SKIRT PLACKET WITH LAP]      A simple placket for underwear is made from a single strip of the goods  put on like an extension hem. On drawers it may be turned in at the  buttonhole end, but not stitched down except at"]]]
