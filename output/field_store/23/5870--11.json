Many of the dismounted riders were chased by bulls, but they stepped  lightly to one side, and, as the animals passed, drove their arrows deep  into their sides.  Thus the tumultuous war went on, amid thundering  tread, and yell, and bellow, till the green plain was transformed into a  sea of blood and mire, and every buffalo of the herd was laid low.    It is not to be supposed that such reckless warfare is invariably waged  without damage to the savages.  Many were the wounds and bruises  received that day, and not a few bones were broken, but happily no lives  were lost.    \"Now, lads, now's our time.  A bold and fearless look's the best at all  times.  Don't look as if ye doubted their friendship; and mind, wotever  ye do, don't use yer arms.  Follow me.\"    Saying this, Joe Blunt leaped on his horse, and, bounding over the ridge  at full speed, galloped headlong across the plain.    The savages observed the strangers instantly, and a loud yell announced  the fact as they assembled from all parts of the field brandishing their  bows and spears.  Joe's quick eye soon distinguished their chief,  towards whom he galloped, still at full speed, till within a yard or two  of his horse's head; then he reined up suddenly.  So rapidly did Joe and  his comrades approach, and so instantaneously did they pull up, that  their steeds were thrown almost on their haunches.    The Indian chief did not move a muscle.  He was a tall powerful savage,  almost naked, and mounted on a coal-black charger, which he sat with the  ease of a man accustomed to ride from infancy.  He was, indeed, a  splendid-looking savage, but his face wore a dark frown, for, although  he and his band had visited the settlements and trafficked with the  fur-traders on the Missouri, he did not love the \"Pale-faces,\" whom he  regarded as intruders on the hunting grounds of his fathers, and the  peace that existed between them at that time was of a very fragile  character.  Indeed, it was deemed by the traders impossible to travel  through the Indian country at that period except in strong force, and it  was the very boldness of the present attempt that secured to our hunters  anything like a civil reception.    Joe, who could speak the Pawnee tongue fluently, began by explaining the  object of his visit, and spoke of the presents which he had brought for  the great chief; but it was evident that his words made little  impression.  As he discoursed to them the savages crowded round the  little party, and began to handle and examine their dresses and weapons  with a degree of rudeness that caused Joe considerable anxiety.    \"Mahtawa believes that the heart of the Pale-face is true,\" said the  savage, when Joe paused, \"but he does not choose to make peace.  The  Pale-faces are grasping.  They never rest.  They turn their eyes to the  great mountains, and say, `There we will stop.'  But even there they  will not stop.  They are never satisfied, Mahtawa knows them well.\"    This speech sank like a death-knell into the hearts of the hunters, for  they knew that if the savages refused to make peace, they would scalp  them all and appropriate their goods.  To make things worse, a  dark-visaged Indian suddenly caught hold of Henri's rifle, and, ere he  was aware, plucked it from his hand.  The blood rushed to the gigantic  hunter's forehead, and he was on the point of springing at the man, when  Joe said in a deep, quiet voice--    \"Be still, Henri.  You will but hasten death.\"    At this moment there was a movement in the outskirts of the circle of  horsemen, and another chief rode into the midst of them.  He was  evidently higher in rank than Mahtawa, for he spoke authoritatively to  the crowd, and stepped in before him.  The hunters drew little comfort  from the appearance of his face, however, for it scowled upon them.  He  was not so powerful a man as Mahtawa, but he was more gracefully formed,  and had a more noble and commanding countenance.    \"Have the Pale-faces no wigwams on the great river that they should come  to spy out the lands of the Pawnee?\" he demanded.    \"We have not come to spy your country,\" answered Joe, raising himself  proudly as he spoke, and taking off his cap.  \"We have come with a  message from the great chief of the Pale-faces, who lives in the village  far beyond the great river where the sun rises.  He says, why should the  Pale-face and the Red-man fight?  They are brothers.  The same Manitou  [the Indian name for God] watches over both.  The Pale-faces have more  beads, and guns, and blankets, and knives, and vermilion than they  require; they wish to give some of these things for the skins and furs  which the Red-man does not know what to do with.  The great chief of the  Pale-faces has sent me to say, `Why should we fight? let us smoke the  pipe of peace!'\"    At the mention of beads and blankets the face of the wily chief  brightened for a moment.  Then he said, sternly--    \"The heart of the Pale-face is not true.  He has come here to trade for  himself.  San-it-sa-rish has eyes that can see--they are not shut.  Are  not these your goods?\"  The chief pointed to the pack-horse as he spoke.    \"Trappers do not take their goods into the heart of an enemy's camp,\"  returned Joe; \"San-it-sa-rish is wise and will understand this.  These  are gifts to the chief of the Pawnees.  There are more awaiting him when  the pipe of peace is smoked.  I have said,--What message shall we take  back to the great chief of the Pale-faces?\"    San-it-sa-rish was evidently mollified.    \"The hunting field is not the council tent,\" he said.  \"The Pale-faces  will go with us to our village.\"    Of course Joe was only too glad to agree to this proposal, but he now  deemed it politic to display a little firmness.    \"We cannot go till our rifle is restored.  It will not do to go back and  tell the great chief of the Pale-faces that the Pawnees are thieves.\"    The chief frowned angrily.    \"The Pawnees are true--they are not thieves.  They choose to _look_ at  the rifle of the Pale-face.  It shall be returned.\"    The rifle was instantly restored, and then our hunters rode off with the  Indians towards their camp.  On the way they met hundreds of women and  children going to the scene of the great hunt, for it was their special  duty to cut up the meat and carry it into camp.  The men, considering  that they had done quite enough in killing it, returned to smoke and eat  away the fatigues of the chase.    As they rode along Dick Varley observed that some of the \"braves,\" as  Indian warriors are styled, were eating pieces of the bloody livers of  the buffaloes in a raw state, at which he expressed not a little  disgust.    \"Ah! boy, you're green yet,\" remarked Joe Blunt in an undertone.  \"Mayhap ye'll be thankful to do that same yerself some day.\"    \"Well, I'll not refuse to try when it is needful,\" said Dick with a  laugh; \"meanwhile I'm content to see the Red-skins do it, Joe Blunt.\"        CHAPTER EIGHT.    DICK AND HIS FRIENDS VISIT THE INDIANS AND SEE MANY WONDERS--CRUSOE,  TOO, EXPERIENCES A FEW SURPRISES AND TEACHES INDIAN DOGS A LESSON--AN  INDIAN DANDY--A FOOT-RACE.    The Pawnee village, at which they soon arrived, was situated in the  midst of a most interesting and picturesque scene.    It occupied an extensive plain which sloped gently down to a creek, [In  America small rivers or riverlets are termed \"creeks\"] whose winding  course was marked by a broken line of wood, here and there interspersed  with a fine clump of trees, between the trunks of which the blue waters  of the lake sparkled in the distance.  Hundreds of tents or \"lodges\" of  buffalo skins covered the ground, and thousand of Indians--men, women,  and children--moved about the busy scene.  Some were sitting in their  lodges, lazily smoking their pipes.  But these were chiefly old and  infirm veterans, for all the young men had gone to the hunt which we  have just described.  The women were stooping over their fires, busily  preparing maize and meat for their husbands and brothers, while myriads  of little brown and naked children romped about everywhere, filling the  air with their yells and screams, which were only equalled, if not  surpassed, by the yelping dogs that seemed innumerable.    Far as the eye could reach were seen scattered herds of horses.  These  were tended by little boys who were totally destitute of clothing, and  who seemed to enjoy with infinite zest the pastime of shooting-practice  with little bows and arrows.  No wonder that these Indians become expert  bowmen.  There were urchins there, scarce two feet high, with round  bullets of bodies and short spindle-shanks, who could knock blackbirds  off the trees at every shot, and cut the heads of the taller flowers  with perfect certainty!  There was much need, too, for the utmost  proficiency they could attain, for the very existence of the Indian  tribes of the prairies depends on their success in hunting the buffalo.    There are hundreds and thousands of North American savages who would  undoubtedly perish and their tribes become extinct if the buffaloes were  to leave the prairies or die out.  Yet, although animals are absolutely  essential to their existence, they pursue and slay them with improvident  recklessness, sometimes killing hundreds of them merely for the sake of  the sport, the tongues, and the marrow-bones.  In the bloody hunt  described in the last chapter, however, the slaughter of so many was not  wanton, because the village that had to be supplied with food was large,  and, just previous to the hunt, they had been living on somewhat reduced  allowance.  Even the blackbirds, shot by the brown-bodied urchins before  mentioned, had been thankfully put into the pot.  Thus precarious is the  supply of food among the Red-men, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#13)"],[1," of spears  and javelins descended on their devoted sides.  I observed that many of  the active natives had leaped up into the trees and discharged their  spears from above, while others, crouching behind fallen trees or  bushes, threw them from below, so that in a few seconds dozens of spears  entered their bodies at every conceivable angle, and they appeared as if  suddenly transformed into monstrous porcupines or hedgehogs.  There was  something almost ludicrous in this, but the magnitude and aspect of the  animals were too terrible, and our danger was too imminent, to permit  anything like comic ideas to enter our brains.  I observed, too, that  the natives were perfectly wild with excitement.  Their black faces  worked convulsively, and their white eyes and teeth glittered as they  leaped and darted about in a state of almost perfect nudity, so that  their aspect was quite demoniacal.    The suddenness and violence of the attack made near to us had the effect  of turning the elephants aside, and the next instant they were tearing  and wrenching themselves through the meshes of the tough and thorny  vines.  The natives closed in with wild cries and with redoubled energy.  Nothing surprised me so much as to observe the incredible number of  spears that were sticking all over these creatures, and the amount of  blood that they lost, without any apparent diminution of strength  resulting.  It seemed as if no human power could kill them, and at that  moment I almost doubted Peterkin's assertion that he had, while in  Ceylon, actually killed elephants with a single ball.    While Jack and Peterkin and I were gazing in deep interest and surprise  at the curious struggle going on before us, and holding ourselves in  readiness to act, should there be any chance of our game escaping, the  larger of the two elephants succeeded in disentangling himself by  backing out of the snare.  He then wheeled round and charged straight at  King Jambai, who stood close to us, with incredible fury.  The beast, as  it came on with the bristling spears all over it, the blood spirting  from its innumerable wounds, and trumpeting shrill with rage, seemed to  me like some huge unearthly phantom.  It was with difficulty I could  believe the whole scene other than a hideous dream.  Jambai launched his  javelin into the animal's chest, and then turned and fled.  The other  natives also darted and scattered hither and thither, so that the  elephant could not make up its mind on which of its enemies to wreak its  vengeance.  We, too, turned and took to our heels at once with right  good will.  All at once I heard Jack utter a wild shout or yell, very  unlike to anything I ever heard from him before.  I looked back, and saw  that his foot had got entangled in a thorny shrub, and that the elephant  was making at him.    To this day I have never been able to account for the remarkable  condition of mind and body that ensued on this occasion.  Instead of  being paralysed as I had been when Peterkin was in imminent danger, all  sensation of fear or hesitancy seemed to vanish on thine instant.  I  felt my nerves and muscles strung, as it were, and rendered firm as a  rock, and with calm deliberation, yet with the utmost rapidity of which  I was capable, I turned round, sprang between Jack and the enraged  beast, and presented my piece at his head.    \"Right in the centre of his forehead,\" gasped Jack, as he endeavoured to  wrench his foot from the entanglement.    At that moment I observed Peterkin leap to my side; the next instant the  report of both our guns rang through the woods; the elephant bounded  completely over Jack, as Peterkin and I leaped to either side to let it  pass, and fell to the ground with such violence that a tree about six  inches thick, against which it struck, went down before it like a willow  wand.    We immediately assisted Jack to extricate himself; but we had no time to  congratulate ourselves on our narrow escape, for mingled shouts and  yells from the men in the bushes ahead apprised us that some new danger  menaced them in that direction.    Reloading as fast as we could, we hastened forward, and soon gained the  new scene of battle.  Here stood the other elephant, trying to break  down a small tree up which King Jambai had climbed, partly for safety  and partly in order to dart a javelin down on the brute as it passed.    This was a common custom of the natives; but the king, who was a bold,  reckless man, had neglected to take the very necessary precaution of  selecting a strong tree.  The elephant seemed actually to have observed  this, for instead of passing on, it suddenly rushed headlong against the  tree and began to break it down.  When we came up the beast was heaving  and straining with all its might, the stout tree was cracking and  rending fearfully, so that the king could scarcely retain his position  on it.  The natives were plying their spears with the utmost vigour; but  although mortally wounded, it was evident that in a few more seconds the  elephant would succeed in throwing down the tree and trample the king to  death.    Peterkin instantly sprang forward, but Jack laid his hand on his  shoulder.    \"It's my turn this time, lad,\" he cried, and leaping towards the  monster, he placed the muzzle of his rifle close to its shoulder and  sent a six-ounce ball right through its heart.    The effect was instantaneous.  The elephant fell to the ground, a  mountain of dead flesh.    The delight of the negroes at this happy termination of the battle was  excessive.  They leaped and laughed and danced like insane men, and we  had much ado to prevent them seizing us in their arms and rubbing noses  with us.    As we had not commenced the hunt until well on in the day, evening was  now closing in; so the king gave orders to encamp on a dry rising ground  not far distant, where the jungle was less dense, and thither we all  repaired, the natives bringing in all the game, and cutting up the  elephants in a very short space of time.    \"Your shot was not such a bad one this time, Ralph,\" observed Peterkin,  as we three stood looking at the large elephant which the natives were  cutting up.  \"There they are, just above the proboscis.  But let me warn  you never again to venture on such a foolhardy thing as to fire in the  face of a charging elephant unless you are a dead shot.\"    \"Thank you, Peterkin, for your advice, which, however, I will not take  when a comrade's life may depend on my doing so.\"    \"I give you full credit for the excellence of your intention,\" rejoined  my friend; \"but if Jack's life had depended on those two shots from your  double-barrel, he would have been but a dead man now.  There is only one  vulnerable spot in the front of an elephant's head; that is, exactly in  the centre of the forehead.  The spot is not bigger than a saucer, and  the bone is comparatively thin there.  If you cannot make _sure_ of  hitting that, you simply face certain death.  I would not have tried it  on any account whatever, had I not seen that both you and Jack would  have been killed had I not done so.\"    On examination we found that the heavy ball from Peterkin's rifle had  indeed penetrated the exact spot referred to, and had been the means of  killing the elephant, while my two bullets were found embedded in the  bone.    The tusks of this animal were magnificent.  I do not know what their  exact weight was, not having the means wherewith to weigh them.  They  were probably worth a considerable sum of money in the British market.  Of course we did not lay claim to any part of the spoil of that day,  with the exception of a few of the beautiful birds shot on the voyage up  the river, which were of no value to the natives, although priceless to  me.  Alas! when I came to examine them next morning, I found that those  destructive creatures the white ants had totally destroyed the greater  part of them, and the few that were worth stuffing were very much  damaged.    Experience is a good though sometimes a severe teacher.  Never again did  I, after that, put off the stuffing of any valuable creature till the  next day.  I always stuffed it in the evening of the day on which it was  killed; and thus, although the practice cost me many a sleepless night,  I preserved, and ultimately brought home, many specimens of rare and  beautiful birds and beasts, which would otherwise have been destroyed by  those rapacious insects.    That night the scene of our camp was indescribably romantic and wild.  Numerous huge fires were lighted, and round these the negroes circled  and cooked elephant and venison steaks, while they talked over the  events of the day or recounted the adventures of former hunts with noisy  volubility and gesticulation.    The negro has a particular love for a fire.  The nights in his warm  climate are chill to him, though not so to Europeans, and he luxuriates  in the heat of a fire as a cat does in the rays of the sun.  The warm  blaze seems to draw out his whole soul, and causes his eyes to sparkle  with delight.  A good supper and a warm fire render him almost perfectly  happy.  There is but one thing wanting to render him supremely so, and  that is--a pipe!  No doubt, under similar circumstances, the white man  also is in a state of enviable felicity, but he does not show his joy  like the negro, who seems to forget his cares and sorrows, the miseries  which his gross superstitions entail on him, the frequency with which he  is exposed to sudden destruction; everything, in short, is forgotten  save the present, and he enjoys himself with unmitigated fervour.    It really did my heart good as I sat with my comrades beside our fire  and looked around me on their happy faces, which were rendered still  happier by the gift from us of a small quantity of tobacco, with which  we had taken care to provide ourselves for this very purpose.    I could scarcely believe that the jovial, kindly, hearty"]]]
