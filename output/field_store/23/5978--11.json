If he had to  spend the period from May to July there he would have small doubts on  the subject. The heat begins to be unpleasant in April, when hot  westernly winds prevail. An occasional thunderstorm with hail relieves  the strain for a little. The warmest period of the year is May and June.  But the intense dry heat is healthier and to many less trying than the  mugginess of the rainy season. The dust-storms which used to be common  have become rarer and lighter with the spread of canal irrigation in the  western Panjab. The rains ought to break at Delhi in the end of June and  at Lahore ten days or a fortnight later. There is often a long break  when the climate is particularly trying. The nights are terribly hot.  The outer air is then less stifling than that of the house, and there is  the chance of a little comparative coolness shortly before dawn. Many  therefore prefer to sleep on the roof or in the verandah. September,  when the rains slacken, is a muggy, unpleasant, and unhealthy month. But  in the latter half of it cooler nights give promise of a better time.    ~Special features of Plain Zones.~--The submontane zone has the most  equable and the pleasantest climate in the plains. It has a rainfall of  from 30 to 40 inches, five-sevenths or more of which belongs to the  monsoon period (June-September). The north-western area has a longer and  colder winter and spring. In the end of December and in January the keen  dry cold is distinctly trying. The figures in Statement I, for  Rawalpindi and Peshawar, are not very characteristic of the zone as a  whole. The average of the rainfall figures, 13 inches for Peshawar and  32 for Rawalpindi, would give a truer result. The monsoon rains come  later and are much less abundant than in the submontane zone. Their  influence is very feeble in the western and south-western part of the  area. On the other hand the winter rains, are heavier than in any other  part of the province. Delhi and Lahore represent the extreme conditions  of the central and south-eastern plains. The latter is really on the  edge of the dry south-western area. The eastern districts of the zone  have a shorter and less severe cold weather than the western, an earlier  and heavier monsoon, but scantier winter rains. The total rainfall  varies from 16 to 30 inches. The south-western zone, with a rainfall of  from 5 to 15 inches, is the driest part of India proper except northern  Sindh and western Rajputana. Neither monsoon current affects it much. At  Multan there are only about fifteen days in the whole year on which any  rain falls.          CHAPTER VI    HERBS, SHRUBS, AND TREES      ~Affinities of Panjab Flora.~--It is hopeless to describe except in the  broadest outline the flora of a tract covering an area of 250,000 square  miles and ranging in altitude from a few hundred feet to a height 10,000  feet above the limit of flowering plants. The nature of the vegetation  of any tract depends on rainfall and temperature, and only secondarily  on soil. A desert is a tract with a dry substratum and dry air, great  heat during some part of the year, and bright sunshine. The soil may be  loam or sand, and as regards vegetation a sandy desert is the worst  owing to the rapid drying up of the subsoil after rain. In the third of  the maps appended to Schimper's _Plant Geography_ by far the greater  part of the area dealt with in this book is shown as part of the vast  desert extending from the Sahara to Manchuria. Seeing that the monsoon  penetrates into the province and that it is traversed by large snow-fed  rivers the Panjab, except in parts of the extreme western and  south-western districts, is not a desert like the Sahara or Gobi,  and Schimper recognised this by marking most of the area as  semi-desert. Still the flora outside the Hills and the submontane  tract is predominantly of the desert type, being xerophilous or  drought-resisting. The adaptations which enable plants to survive in a  tract deficient in moisture are of various kinds. The roots may be  greatly developed to enable them to tap the subsoil moisture, the  leaves may be reduced in size, converted into thorns, or entirely  dispensed with, in order to check rapid evaporation, they may be covered  with silky or felted hairs, a modification which produces the same  result, or their internal tissue may be succulent or mucilaginous. In  the plants of the Panjab plains there is no difficulty in recognising  these features of a drought-resisting flora. Schimper's map shows in the  north-east of the area a wedge thrust in between the plains' desert and  the dry elevated alpine desert cut off from the influence of the monsoon  by the lofty barrier of the Inner Himalaya. This consists of two parts,  monsoon forest, corresponding roughly with the Himalayan area Cis Ravi  above the 5000 feet contour, and dry woodland of a semi-tropical stamp,  consisting, of the adjoining foot-hills and submontane tract. This wedge  is in fact treated as part of the zone, which in the map (after Drude)  prefixed to Willis' _Manual and Dictionary of the Flowering Plants and  Ferns_, is called Indo-Malayan, and which embraces the Malayan  Archipelago and part of North Australia, Burma, and practically the  whole of India except the Panjab, Sindh, and Rajputana. In Drude's map  the three countries last mentioned are included in a large zone called  \"the Mediterranean and Orient.\" This is a very broad classification, and  in tracing the relationships of the Panjab flora it is better to treat  the desert area of North Africa, which in Tripoli and Egypt extends to  the coast, apart from the Mediterranean zone. It is a familiar fact  that, as we ascend lofty mountains like those of the Himalaya, we pass  through belts or regions of vegetation of different types. The air  steadily becomes rarer and therefore colder, especially at night, and at  the higher levels there is a marked reduction in the rainfall. When the  alpine region, which in the Himalaya may be taken as beginning at 11,000  feet, is reached, the plants have as a rule bigger roots, shorter  stems, smaller leaves, but often larger and more brilliantly coloured  flowers. These are adaptations of a drought-resisting kind.    ~Regions.~--In this sketch it will suffice to divide the tract into six  regions:      Plains 1. Panjab dry plain.             2. Salt Range and North West Plateau, from              the frontier to Pabbi Hills.             3. Submontane Hills on east bank of Jhelam.      Hills  4. Sub-Himalaya, 2000-5000 feet.             5. Temperate Himalaya, 5000-11,000 feet.             6. Alpine Himalaya, 11,000-16,000 feet.    Of course a flora does not fit itself into compartments, and the changes  of type are gradual.    ~Panjab Dry Plain.~--The affinities of the flora of the Panjab plains  south of the Salt Range and the submontane tract are, especially in the  west, with the desert areas of Persia, Arabia, and North Africa, though  the spread of canal irrigation is modifying somewhat the character of  the vegetation. The soil and climate are unsuited to the growth of large  trees, but adapted to scrub jungle of a drought-resisting type, which at  one time covered very large areas from the Jamna to the Jhelam. The soil  on which this sparse scrub grew is a good strong loam, but the rainfall  was too scanty and the water-level too deep to admit of much cultivation  outside the valleys of the rivers till the labours of canal engineers  carried their waters to the uplands. East of the Sutlej the Bikaner  desert thrusts northwards a great wedge of sandy land which occupies a  large area in Bahawalpur, Hissar, Ferozepur, and Patiala. Soil of this  description is free of forest growth, and the monsoon rainfall in this  part of the province is sufficient to encourage an easy, but very  precarious, cultivation of autumn millets and pulses. The great Thal  desert to the south of the Salt Range between the valleys of the Jhelam  and the Indus has a similar soil, but the scantiness of the rainfall has  confined cultivation within much narrower limits. Between the Sutlej and  the Jhelam the uplands between the river valleys are known locally as  Bars. The largest of the truly indigenous trees of the Panjab plains are  the _farash_ (Tamarix articulata) and the thorny _kikar_ (Acacia  Arabica). The latter yields excellent wood for agricultural implements,  and fortunately it grows well in sour soils. Smaller thorny acacias are  the _nimbar_ or _raunj_ (Acacia leucophloea) and the _khair_ (Acacia  Senegal). The dwarf tamarisk, _pilchi_ or _jhao_ (Tamarix dioica), grows  freely in moist sandy soils near rivers. The scrub jungle consists  mostly of _jand_ (Prosopis spicigera), a near relation of the Acacias,  _jal_ or _van_ (Salvadora oleoides), and the coral-flowered _karil_ or  leafless caper (Capparis aphylla). All these show their desert  affinities, the _jand_ by its long root and its thorns, the _jal_ by its  small leathery leaves, and the _karil_ by the fact that it has managed  to dispense with leaves altogether. The _jand_ is a useful little tree,  and wherever it grows the natural qualities of the soil are good. The  sweetish fruit of the _jal_, known as _pilu_, is liked by the people,  and in famines they will even eat the berries of the leafless caper.  Other characteristic plants of the Panjab plains are under Leguminosae,  the _khip_ (Crotalaria burhia), two Farsetias (_farid ki buti_), and the  _jawasa_ or camel thorn (Alhagi camelorum), practically leafless, but  with very long and stout spines; under Capparidaceae several Cleomes,  species of Corchorus (Tiliaceae), under Zygophyllaceae three  Mediterranean genera, Tribulus, Zygophyllum, and Fagonia, under  Solanaceae several Solanums and Withanias, and various salsolaceous  Chenopods known as _lana_.

Will he not discover  through the whole of them a servile acquiescence in the opinions and  discoveries of one man, however at variance they may be with truth or  probability; and if he enter upon the discussion with his mind free from  prejudice, will he not experience that an outrage has been committed  upon his reason, in calling upon him to give assent to positions and  principles which at best are merely assumed, but to which he is called  upon dogmatically to subscribe his acquiescence as the indubitable  results of experience, skill and ability? The editors of the works above  alluded to, should boldly and indignantly have declared, that from their  own experience in the natural economy of the insect, they were able to  pronounce the circumstances as related by Huber to be directly  _impossible_, and the whole of them based on fiction and imposition.\"    Let the reader change only a few words in this extract: for \"the natural  history of the bee or its management,\" let him write, \"the subject of  religion;\" for, \"the works of Bagster, Bevan,\" &c., let him put, \"the  works of Moses, Paul,\" &c.; for, \"their own experience in the natural  economy of the insect,\" let him substitute, \"their own experience in the  nature of man;\" and for, \"circumstances as related by Huber,\" let him  insert, \"as related by Luke or John,\" and it will sound almost precisely  like a passage from some infidel author.    I resume the quotation from Huish; \"If we examine the account which  Huber gives of his invention (!) of the royal jelly, the existence and  efficacy of which are fully acquiesced in by the aforesaid editors, to  what other conclusions are we necessarily driven, than that they are the  dupes of a visionary enthusiast, whose greatest merit consists in his  inventive powers, no matter how destitute those powers may be of all  affinity with truth or probability? Before, however, these editors  bestowed their unqualified assent on the existence of this royal jelly,  did they stop to put to themselves the following questions? By what kind  of bee is it made?[9] Whence is it procured? Is it a natural or an  elaborated substance? If natural, from what source is it derived? If  elaborated, in what stomach of the bee is it to be found? How is it  administered? What are its constituent principles? Is its existence  optional or definite? Whence does it derive its miraculous power of  converting a common egg into a royal one? Will any of the aforesaid  editors publicly answer these questions? and ought they not to have been  able to answer them, before they so unequivocally expressed their belief  in its existence, its powers and administration?\"    How puerile does all this sound to one who has _seen_ and _tasted_ the  royal jelly! And permit me to add, how equally unmeaning do the  objections of infidels seem, to those who have an experimental  acquaintance with the divine hopes and consolations of the Gospel of  Christ.

[6] Bevan.    [7] Having already spoken of Swammerdam, I shall give a brief extract  from the celebrated Dr. Boerhaave's memoir of this wonderful naturalist,  which should put to the blush, if any thing can, the arrogance of those  superficial observers who are too wise in their own conceit, to avail  themselves of the knowledge of others.    \"This treatise on Bees proved so fatiguing a performance, that  Swammerdam never afterwards recovered even the appearance of his former  health and vigor. He was almost continually engaged by day in making  observations, and as constantly engaged by night in recording them by  drawings and suitable explanations.\"    \"This being summer work, his daily labor began at six in the morning,  when the sun afforded him light enough to survey such minute objects;  and from that hour till twelve, he continued without interruption, all  the while exposed in the open air to the scorching heat of the sun,  bareheaded for fear of intercepting his sight, and his head in a manner  dissolving into sweat under the irresistible ardors of that powerful  luminary. And if he desisted at noon, it was only because the strength  of his eyes was too much weakened, by the extraordinary afflux of light  and the use of microscopes, to continue any longer upon such small  objects, though as discernible in the afternoon, as they had been in the  forenoon.\"    \"Our author, the better to accomplish his vast, unlimited views, often  wished for a year of perpetual heat and light to perfect his inquiries,  with a polar night to reap all the advantages of them by proper drawings  and descriptions.\"    [8] The formation of swarms will be particularly described in another  chapter.    [9] Suppose that we are unable to give a satisfactory answer to any of  these questions, does our ignorance on these points disprove the _fact_  of the existence of such a jelly?          CHAPTER IV.    COMB.      Wax is a natural secretion of the bees; it may be called _their oil or  fat_. If they are gorged with honey, or any liquid sweet, and remain  quietly clustered together, it is formed in small wax pouches on their  abdomen, and comes out in the shape of very delicate scales. Soon after  a swarm is hived, the bottom board will be covered with these scales.        \"Thus, filtered through yon flutterer's folded mail,      Clings the cooled wax, and hardens to a scale.      Swift, at the well known call, the ready train,      (For not a buz boon Nature breathes in vain,)      Spring to each falling flake, and bear along      Their glossy burdens to the builder throng.      These with sharp sickle or with sharper tooth,      Pare each excrescence, and each angle smooth,      Till now, in finish'd pride, two radiant rows      Of snow white cells one mutual base disclose.      Six shining panels gird each polish'd round,      The door's fine rim, with waxen fillet bound,      While walls so thin, with sister walls combined,      Weak in themselves, a sure dependence find.\"                                               _Evans._    Huber was the first to demonstrate that wax is a natural secretion of  the bee, when fed on honey or any saccharine substance. Most Apiarians  before his time, supposed that it was made from pollen or bee-bread,  either in a crude or digested state. He confined a new swarm of bees in  a hive placed in a dark and cool room, and on examining them, at the  end of five days, found several beautiful white combs in their  tenement: these were taken from them, and they were again confined and  supplied with honey and water, and a second time new combs were  constructed. Five times in succession their combs were removed, and were  in each instance replaced, the bees being all the time prevented from  ranging the fields, to supply themselves with bee-bread. By subsequent  experiments he proved that sugar answered the same end with honey.    He then confined a swarm, giving them no honey, but an abundance of  fruit and pollen. They subsisted on the fruit, but refused to touch the  pollen; and no combs were constructed, nor any wax scales formed in  their pouches. These experiments are conclusive; and are interesting,  not merely as proving that wax is secreted from honey or saccharine  substances, but because they show in what a thorough manner the  experiments of Huber were conducted. Confident assertions are easily  made, requiring only a little breath or a drop of ink; and the men who  deal most in them, have often a profound contempt for observation and  experiment. To establish even a simple truth, on the solid foundation of  demonstrated facts, often requires the most patient and protracted toil.    _A high temperature_ is necessary for comb-building, in order that the  wax may be soft enough to be moulded into shape. The very process of its  secretion helps to furnish the amount of heat which is required to work  it. This is a very interesting fact which seems never before to have  been noticed.    Honey or sugar is found to contain by weight, about eight pounds of  oxygen to one of carbon and hydrogen. When changed into wax, the  proportions are entirely reversed: the wax contains only one pound of  oxygen to more than sixteen pounds of hydrogen and carbon. Now as  oxygen is the grand supporter of animal heat, the consumption of so  large a quantity of it, aids in producing the extraordinary heat which  always accompanies comb-building, and which is necessary to keep the wax  in the soft and plastic state requisite to enable the bees to mould it  into such exquisitely delicate and beautiful shapes! Who can fail to  admire the wisdom of the Creator in this beautiful instance of  adaptation?    The most careful experiments have clearly established the fact, that at  least _twenty"]]]
