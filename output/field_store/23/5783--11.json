Wherefore the inhabitants of the wretched valley have so changed  their nature that it seems as though Circe had had them in her  feeding. Among foul hogs,[4] more fit for acorns than for other  food made for human use, it first directs its poor path. Then,  coming down, it finds curs more snarling, than their power  warrants,[5] and at them disdainfully it twists its  muzzle.[6] It goes on falling, and the more it swells so much the  more the accursed and ill-fated ditch finds the dogs becoming  wolves.[7] Descending then through many hollow gulfs, it finds  foxes[8] so full of fraud, that they fear not that wit may entrap  them. Nor will I leave to speak though another hear me: and well  it will be for this one if hereafter he mind him of that which a  true spirit discloses to me.    [1] These words are spoken by Guido del Duca, who is answered by  Rinieri de' Calboli; both of them from the Romagna.    [2] One of the highest of the Tuscan Apennines.    [3] The north-eastern promontory of Sicily.    [4] The people of the Casentino, the upper valley of the Arno.    [5] The Aretines.    [6] Turning westward.    [7] The wolves of Florence.    [8] The Pisans.      \"I see thy grandson,[1] who becomes hunter of those wolves upon  the bank of the fierce stream, and terrifies them all. He sells  their flesh,[2] it being yet alive; then he slays them, like an  old wild beast; many of life, himself of honor he deprives.  Bloody he comes forth from the dismal wood;[3] he leaves it such,  that from now for a thousand years, in its primal state it is not  rewooded.\" As at the announcement of grievous ills, the face of  him who listens is disturbed, from whatsoever side the danger may  assail him, so I saw the other soul, that was turned to hear,  become disturbed and sad, when it had gathered to itself the  words.    [1] Fulcieri da Calvoli, so named by Villani (viii. 69), \"a  fierce and cruel man,\" was made podesta of Florence in 1302. He  put to death many of the White Guelphs, and banished more of  them.    [2] Bribed by the opposite party.    [3] Florence, spoiled and undone.      The speech of one and the look of the other made me wishful to  know their names, and I made request for it, mixed with prayers.  Wherefore the spirit which first had spoken to me began again,  \"Thou wishest that I abase myself in doing that for thee which  thou wilt not do for me; but since God wills that such great  grace of His shine through in thee, I will not be chary to thee;  therefore know that I am Guido del Duca. My blood was so inflamed  with envy, that had I seen a man becoming joyful, thou wouldst  have seen me overspread with livid hue. Of my sowing I reap this  straw. O human race, why dost thou set thy heart there where is  need of exclusion of companionship?    \"This one is Rinier; this is the glory and the honor of the house  of Calboli,[1] where no one since has made himself heir of his  worth. And between the Po and the mountain,[2] and the sea[3] and  the Reno,[4] not his blood alone has become stripped of the good  required for truth and for delight; for within these limits the  ground is so full of poisonous stocks, that slowly would they now  die out through cultivation. Where is the good Lizio, and Arrigo  Manardi, Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna? O men of Romagna  turned to bastards! When in Bologna will a Fabbro take root  again? When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco, the noble scion of a  mean plant? Marvel not, Tuscan, if I weep, when I remember with  Guido da Prata, Ugolin d' Azzo who lived with us, Federico  Tignoso and his company, the house of Traversara, and the  Anastagi, (both the one race and the other is without heir), the  ladies and the cavaliers, the toils and the pleasures for which  love and courtesy inspired our will, there where hearts have  become so wicked. O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee away,  since thy family hath gone, and many people, in order not to be  guilty? Well doth Bagnacaval that gets no more sons; and ill doth  Castrocaro, and worse Conio that takes most trouble to beget such  counts. Well will the Pagani do when their Demon shall go from  them;[6] yet not so that a pure report of them can ever remain. O  Ugolin de' Fantolin! thy name is secure, since one who,  degenerating, can make it dark is no longer awaited. But go thy  way, Tuscan, now; for now it pleases me far more to weep than to  speak, so much hath our discourse wrung my mind.\"    [1] A noble Guelph family of Forli.    [2] The Apennines.    [3] The Adriatic.    [4] Near Bologna.    [5] These and the others named afterwards were well-born,  honorable, and courteous men in Romagna in the thirteenth  century. What is known of them may be found in Benvenuto da  Imola's comment, and in that of Scartazzini.    [6] The Pagani were lords of Faenza and Imola (see Hell, Canto  XXVII); the Demon was Mainardo, who died in 1302.      We knew that those dear souls heard us go; therefore by silence  they made us confident of the road. After we had become alone by  going on, a voice that seemed like lightning when it cleaves the  air, came counter to us, saying, \"Everyone that findeth me shall  slay me,\" [1] and fled like thunder which rolls away, if suddenly  the cloud is rent. Soon as our hearing had a truce from it, lo!  now another with so great a crash that it resembled thunderings  in swift succession: \"I am Aglauros who became a stone.\"[2] And  then to draw me close to the Poet, I backward and not forward  took a step. Now was the air quiet on every side, and he said to  me, \"That was the hard curb[3] which ought to hold man within his  bound; but ye take the bait, so that the hook of the old  adversary draws you to him, and therefore little avails bridle or  lure. Heaven calls you, and around you circles, displaying to you  its eternal beauties, and your eye looks only on the ground;  wherefore He who discerns everything scourges you.    [1] The words of Cain--Genesis, iv. 14.    [2] Daughter of Cecrops, changed to stone because of envy of her  sister.    [3] These examples of the fatal consequences of the sin.        CANTO XV. Second Ledge: the Envious.--An Angel removes the second  P from Dante's forehead.--Discourse concerning the Sharing of  Good.--Ascent to the Third Ledge: the Wrathful.--Examples of  Forbearance seen in Vision.      As much as appears, between the beginning of the day and the  close of the third hour, of the sphere that ever in manner of a  child is sporting, so much now, toward the evening, appeared to  be remaining of his course for the sun.[1] It was vespers[2]  there,[3] and here midnight; and the rays struck us across the  nose,[4] because the mountain had been so circled by us that we  were now going straight toward the sunset, when I felt my  forehead weighed down by the splendor far more than at first, and  the things not known were a wonder to me.[5] Wherefore I lifted  my hands toward the top of my brows, and made for myself the  visor that lessens the excess of what is seen.    [1] The sun was still some three hours from his setting. The  sphere that ever is sportive like a child has been variously  interpreted; perhaps Dante only meant the sphere of the heavens  which by its ever varying aspect suggests the image of a playful  spirit.    [2] Dante uses \"vespers\" as the term for the last of the four  canonical divisions of the day; that is, from three to six P.M.  See Convito, iv. 23. Three o'clock in Purgatory corresponds with  midnight in Italy.    [3] In Italy.    [4] Full in the face.    [5] The source of this increase of brightness being unknown, it  caused him astonishment.      As when from water, or from the mirror, the ray leaps to the  opposite quarter, and, mounting up in like manner to that in  which it descends, at equal distance departs as much from the  falling of the stone,[1] as experiment and art show; so it seemed  to me that I was struck by light reflected there in front of me,  from which my sight was swift to fly. \"What is that, sweet  Father, from which I cannot screen my sight so that it avails  me,\" said I, \"and which seems to be moving toward us?\" \"Marvel  not if the family of Heaven still dazzle thee,\" he replied to me;  \"it is a messenger that comes to invite men to ascend. Soon will  it be that to see these things will not be grievous to thee, but  will be delight to thee as great as nature fitted thee to feel.\"    [1] I.e., the perpendicular, at the point of incidence.      When we had reached the blessed Angel, with a glad voice he said,  \"Enter ye here to a stairway far less steep than the others.\"    We were mounting, already departed thence, and \"Beati  misericordes\"[1] had been sung behind us, and \"Rejoice thou that  overcomest.\" [2] My Master and I, we two alone, were going on  upward, and I was thinking to win profit as we went from his  words; and I addressed me to him, thus enquiring, \"What did the  spirit from Romagna mean, mentioning exclusion and  companionship?\"[3] Wherefore he to me, \"Of his own greatest fault  he knows the harm, and therefore it is not to be wondered at if  he reprove it, in order that there may be less lamenting on  account of it. Because  your desires are directed there, where,  through companionship, a share is lessened, envy moves the  bellows for your sighs. But if the love of the highest sphere[4]  had turned your desire on high, that fear would not be in your  breast; for the more there are who there say 'ours,' so much the  more of good doth each possess, and the more of charity burns in  that cloister.\"[5] \"I am more hungering to be contented,\" said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#13)"],[1,"ere now ran  straight and swift across the sea through all its course, to  perish at last at entrance of the harbor. Let not dame Bertha and  master Martin, seeing one rob, and another make offering, believe  to see them within the Divine counsel:[10] for the one may rise  and the other may fall.\"    [1] If from two premises, one necessary and one contingent, a  necessary conclusion is to be deduced.    [2] \"If a prime motion is to be assumed,\" that is, a motion not  the effect of another.    [3] He did not ask through idle curiosity to know the number of  the Angels; nor for the solution of a logical puzzle, nor for  that of a question in metaphysics, or of a problem in geometry.    [4] If thou understandest this comment on my former words, to see  so much no second has arisen,\" my meaning will be clear that his  vision was unmatched in respect to the wisdom which it behoves a  king to possess.    [5] Thus distinguishing, it is apparent that Solomon is not  brought into comparison, in respect to perfection of wisdom, with  Adam or with Christ.    [6] Christ.    [7] Because he returns not only empty-handed, but with his mind  perverted.    [8] Heathen philosophers who went astray in seeking for the  truth.    [9] Sabellius denied the Trinity, Arius denied the  Consubstantiality of the word.    [10] To understand the mystery of predestination.        CANTO XIV. At the prayer of Beatrice, Solomon tells of the  glorified body of the blessed after the Last Judgment.--Ascent to  the Heaven of Mars.--Souls of the Soldiery of Christ in the form  of a Cross with the figure of Christ thereon.--Hymn of the  Spirits.    From the centre to the rim, and so from the rim to the centre,  the water in a round vessel moves, according as it is struck from  without or within. This which I say fell suddenly into my mind  when the glorious life of Thomas became silent, because of the  similitude which was born of his speech and that of Beatrice,  whom after him it pleased thus to begin,[1] \"This man has need,  and he tells it not to you, neither with his voice nor as yet in  thought, of going to the root of another truth. Tell him if the  light wherewith your substance blossoms will remain with you  eternally even as it is now; and if it remain, tell how, after  you shall be again made visible, it will be possible that it hurt  not your sight.\"[2]    [1] St. Thomas had spoken from his place in the ring which  formed a circle around Beatrice and Dante; Beatrice now was  speaking from the centre where she stood.    [2] The souls of the blessed are hidden in the light which  emanates from them; after the resurrection of the body they will  become visible, but then how will the bodily eyes endure such  brightness?      As, when urged and drawn by greater pleasure, those who are  dancing in a ring with one accord lift their voice and gladden  their motions, so, at that prompt and devout petition, the holy  circles showed new joy in their turning and in their marvellous  melody. Whoso laments because man dies here in order to live  thereabove, has not seen here the refreshment of the eternal  rain.    That One and Two and Three which ever lives, and ever reigns in  Three and Two and One, uncircumscribed, and circumscribing  everything, was thrice sung by each of those spirits with such a  melody that for every merit it would be a just reward. And I  heard in the divinest light of the small circle a modest  voice,[1] perhaps such as was that of the Angel to Mary, make  answer, \"As long as the festival of Paradise shall be, so long  will our love radiate around us such a garment. Its brightness  follows our ardor, the ardor our vision, and that is great in  proportion as it receives of grace above its own worth. When the  glorious and sanctified flesh shall be put on us again, our  persons will be more pleasing through being all complete;  wherefore whatever of gratuitous light the Supreme Good gives us  will be increased,--light which enables us to see him; so that  our vision needs must increase, our ardor increase which by that  is kindled, our radiance increase which comes from this. But even  as a coal which gives forth flame, and by a vivid glow surpasses  it, so that it defends its own aspect,[2] thus this effulgence,  which already encircles us, will be vanquished in appearance by  the flesh which all this while the earth covers. Nor will so  great a light be able to fatigue us, for the organs of the body  will be strong for everything which shall have power to delight  us.\" So sudden and ready both one and the other choir seemed to  me in saying \"Amen,\" that truly they showed desire for their dead  bodies, perhaps not only for themselves, but also for their  mothers, for their fathers, and for the others who were dear  before they became sempiternal flames.    [1] Probably that of Solomon, who in the tenth Canto is said to  be \"the light which is the most beautiful among us.\"    [2] The coal is seen glowing through the flame.      And lo! round about, of a uniform brightness, arose a lustre,  outside that which was there, like an horizon which is growing  bright. And even as at rise of early evening new appearances  begin in the heavens, so that the sight seems and seems not true,  it seemed to me that there I began to see new subsistences, and a  circle forming outside the other two circumferences. O true  sparkling of the Holy Spirit, how sudden and glowing it became to  mine eyes, which, vanquished, endured it not! But Beatrice showed  herself to me so beautiful and smiling that she must be left  among those sights which have not followed my memory.    Thence my eyes regained power to raise themselves again, and I  saw myself alone with my Lady transferred to higher salvation.[1]    That I was more uplifted I perceived clearly by the fiery smile  of the star, which seemed to me ruddier than its wont. With all  my heart and with that speech which is one in all men,[2] I made  to God a holocaust such as was befitting to the new grace; and  the ardor of the sacrifice was not yet exhausted in my breast  when I knew that offering had been accepted and propitious; for  with such great glow and such great ruddiness splendors appeared  to me within two rays, that I said, \"O Helios,[3] who dost so  array them!\"    [1] To a higher grade of blessedness, that of the Fifth Heaven.    [2] The unuttered voice of the soul.    [3] Whether Dante forms this word from the Hebrew Eli (my God),  or adopts the Greek {Greek here} (sun), is uncertain.      Even as, marked out by less and greater lights, the Galaxy so  whitens between the poles of the world that it indeed makes the  wise to doubt,[1] thus, constellated in the depth of Mars, those  rays made the venerable sign which joinings of quadrants in a  circle make. Here my memory overcomes my genius, for that Cross  was flashing forth Christ, so that I know not to find worthy  comparison. But be who takes his cross and follows Christ will  yet excuse me for that which I omit, when in that brightness he  beholds Christ gleaming.    [1] \"Concerning the GaJaxy philosophers have held different  opinions.\"--Convito, 115.      From horn to horn[1] and between the top and the base lights were  moving, brightly scintillating as they met together and in their  passing by. Thus here[2] are seen, straight and athwart, swift  and slow, changing appearance, the atoms of bodies, long and  short, moving through the sunbeam, wherewith sometimes the shade  is striped which people contrive with skill and art for their  protection. And as a viol or harp, strung in harmony of many  strings, makes a sweet tinkling to one by whom the tune is not  caught, thus from the lights which there appeared to me a melody  was gathered through the Cross, which rapt me without  understanding of the hymn. Truly was I aware that it was of holy  praise, because there came to me \"Arise and conquer!\" as unto one  who understands not, and yet bears. I was so enamoured therewith  that until then had not been anything which had fettered me with  such sweet bonds. Perchance my word appears too daring, in  setting lower the pleasure from the beautiful eyes, gazing into  which my desire has repose. But he who considers that the living  seals[3] of every beauty have more effect the higher they are,  and that I there had not turned round to those eyes, can excuse  me for that whereof I accuse myself in order to excuse myself,  and see that I speak truth; for the holy pleasure is not here  excluded, because it becomes the purer as it mounts.    [1] From arm to arm of the cross.    [2] On earth.    [3] The Heavens, which are \"the seal of mortal wax\" (Canto  VIII.), increase in power as they are respectively nearer the  Empyrean, so that the joy in each, as it is higher up, is greater  than in the heavens below. To this time Dante had felt no joy  equal to that afforded him by this song. But a still greater joy  awaited him in the eyes of Beatrice, to which, since he entered  the Fifth Heaven, he had not turned, but which there, as  elsewhere, were to afford the supreme delight.        CANTO XV. Dante is welcomed by his ancestor, Cacciaguida.--  Cacciaguida tells of his family, and of the simple life of  Florence in the old days.    A benign will, wherein the love which righteously inspires always  manifests itself, as cupidity does in the evil will, imposed  silence on that sweet lyre, and quieted the holy strings which  the right hand of heaven slackens and draws tight. How unto just  petitions shall those substances be deaf, who, in order to give  me wish to pray unto them, were concordant in silence? Well is it  that be endlessly should grieve who, for the love of thing which  endures not eternally, despoils him of that love.    As, through the tranquil and pure evening skies, a sudden fire  shoots from time to time, moving the eyes which were at rest, and  seems to be a star which changes place, except that from the  region where it"]]]
