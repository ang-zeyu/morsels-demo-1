The mark was  almost an invisible one, for it was never afterwards noticed. Had she  shown it to any of the women of her acquaintance, they would have come  forward when the change of children took place, and have pointed out  that the children could be easily distinguished, inasmuch as my child  had a peculiar mark. I feel sure that even her husband knew nothing  about this mark, for I don't believe he was a party to the fraud. He was  terribly upset by the whole business, and took to drink afterwards.  There were continual quarrels between his wife and himself, and she left  him and went to England. I believe if he could have pointed out which  was my child and which was his own, he would have done so.    \"Certainly, I myself should have attached little or no weight to this  woman's story if she had come here with it. I should have turned her out  of the house, and have told her to go to a court if she dare and claim  the custody of her son. She must have known the weakness of her own  position, and as I say, having once opened the matter to Edgar, she  determined to stick to it, knowing that a boy taken thus on a sudden  would be likely to believe her, whereas if she said that you were her  son she would find you already prepared and probably have to confront me  too. So you see, Rupert, I can truthfully advertise--'Woman's story not  believed; we are in as much doubt as before; both are regarded by us as  our sons.'\"    \"I am glad, father!\" Rupert exclaimed excitedly. \"Oh! if Edgar had but  written to you first, instead of going straight away.\"    \"It would have been better,\" Captain Clinton said, \"but I cannot blame  him. I think it was natural that he should go as he did. He would have  thought that had he written to me it would have seemed as if he wanted  something from me, and anything would have seemed better to him than  that. However, we must set about doing something at once. I shall go by  the nine o'clock local to Swindon, and on by the night mail to town.  Then I shall set a detective at work. He may find out from the porters  if anyone noticed a lad arrive by the night mail this morning, and shall  draw up carefully-worded advertisements. I shall write to Mr.  River-Smith before I start. What would you like, Rupert--to go back  to-morrow, or to stay away until the end of the term? If you take my  advice, you will go back; it would be a pity for you to miss your  examinations.\"    \"I don't think I could get through the examinations, father, with this  on my mind; besides, what should I say to the fellows about Edgar's  going away? You see, if we find him before next term begins, we need say  nothing about it.\"    \"You would have to account for his having run away, Rupert, anyhow. I  think you had better go back, my boy, and tell the facts of the story.  There is not the slightest discredit in it, and it would be better for  Edgar himself that it should be known that he went under the influence  of a mistake than that all sorts of reasons should be assigned for his  absence. There will, of course, be no occasion to go into full details.  You would tell the story of the confusion that arose as to the children,  and say that Edgar had received some information which led him  erroneously to conclude that the problem was solved, and that he was not  my son, and that therefore he had run away so as to avoid receiving any  further benefits from the mistake that had been made.\"    \"Perhaps that would be best, father. Indeed I don't know what I should  do if I were to stop here now with nothing to do but to worry about  him.\"    \"I am sure it will be best, Rupert. I will tell your master you will  return to-morrow afternoon.\"    Captain Clinton went up to town by the night mail, and in the morning  went to a private detective's office. After giving particulars of  Edgar's age and appearance he went on: \"As he had no luggage with him,  and there was nothing particular about his personal appearance, I  consider it altogether useless to search for him in London; but I think  it possible that he may try to enlist.\"    \"Sixteen is too young for them to take him, unless he looks a good deal  older than he is.\"    \"Yes, I quite see that. At the same time that is the only thing that  occurs to us as likely for him to try.\"    \"Not likely to take to the sea, sir?\"    \"Not at all likely from what we know of his fancies. Still he might do  that for a couple of years with a view to enlisting afterwards.\"    \"How about going to the States or Canada?\"    \"That again is quite possible.\"    \"Had he money with him, sir?\"    \"He had about five pounds in his pocket, and a gold watch and chain  that he had only had a few months, and could, I should think, get seven  or eight pounds for; but I do not see what he could do to get his living  if he went abroad.\"    \"No, sir; but then young gents always have a sort of fancy that they can  get on well out there, and if they do not mind what they turn to I fancy  that most of them can. Is he in any trouble, sir? You will excuse my  asking, but a young chap who gets into trouble generally acts in a  different sort of way to one who has gone out what we may call  venturesome.\"    \"No, he has got into no trouble,\" Captain Clinton said. \"He has gone  away under a misunderstanding, but there is nothing whatever to make him  wish to conceal himself beyond the fact that he will do all he can to  prevent my tracing him at present. Here are half a dozen of his photos.  If you want more I can get them struck off.\"    \"I could do with another half-dozen,\" the man said. \"I will send them  down to men who act with me at Southampton, Hull, Liverpool, Glasgow,  and Plymouth, and will send two or three abroad. He might cross over to  Bremen or Hamburg, a good many go that way now. I will look after the  recruiting offices here myself; but as he is only sixteen, and as you  say does not look older, I do not think there is a chance of his trying  that. No recruiting sergeant would take him up. No, sir; I should say  that if he has no friends he can go to, the chances are he will try to  ship for the States or Canada. But what are we to do if we find him?\"    Captain Clinton had not thought of this.    \"Of course,\" the man went on, \"if you gave an authority for me to send  down to each of my agents, they could take steps to stop him.\"    \"No,\" Captain Clinton said after a pause, during which he had been  thinking that as he could not swear that Edgar was his son, he was in  fact powerless in the matter. \"No, I do not wish that done. I have no  idea whatever of coercing him. I want, if possible, to see him and  converse with him before he goes. If that is not possible, and if he is  not found until just as the ship is sailing, then I want your agent to  wire to me the name of the steamer in which he goes and the port to  which it sails. Then if there is a faster steamer going, I might be  there as soon as he is; if not, I should wish you to telegraph to a  private detective firm across the water, which I suppose you could do,  to have somebody to meet the steamer as she came in, and without his  knowing it to keep him under his eye until I arrive.\"    \"I could manage all that, sir, easily enough. I will send off four of  the photographs at once to the ports and the others as soon as I get  them, and will go down with the other photograph to the recruiting  office and arrange with one of the sergeants engaged there to let me  know if he turns up, and will send a man down to the docks to watch the  ships there. I will send off the other photos directly I get them.\"    There was nothing else for Captain Clinton to do, but before he returned  home he wrote out a series of advertisements and left them at the  offices of the principal papers. They ran as follows:--\"If E.C., who  left Cheltenham suddenly, will return home he will find that he has  acted under a misapprehension. The woman's story was untrustworthy. He  is still regarded as a son by P.C. and L.C.\" Having done this he drove  to Paddington, and went down by an afternoon train.    Rupert arrived at Cheltenham just as the others had sat down to tea.    \"Hullo, Clinton! Back again, eh? Glad to see you.\"    Rupert nodded a reply to the greeting. His heart was too full to speak,  and he dropped into the seat he was accustomed to use, the others moving  up closely to make room for him. A significant glance passed between the  boys. They saw that Edgar was not with him, and guessed that there was  something wrong. There had been a good deal of wonder among them at the  Clintons' sudden disappearance, and although several of the boys had  seen Rupert go into his brother's dormitory none had seen Edgar, and  somehow or other it leaked out that Rupert had started in a cab to the  station alone. There had been a good deal of quiet talk among the  seniors about it. All agreed that there was something strange about the  matter, especially as Robert, when questioned on the subject, had  replied that Mr. River-Smith's orders were that he was to say nothing  about it. As a precautionary measure orders were given to the juniors  that no word about the Clintons' absence was to be said outside the  house.    After tea was over Rupert went up to Pinkerton.    \"Pinkerton, I should like to have a talk with you and Easton and two or  three others--Skinner, and Mossop, and Templer--yes, and Scudamore.\"    \"Just as you like, Clinton. Of course if you like to tell us anything we  shall be glad to hear it, but we all know that your brother was not the  sort of fellow to get into any dishonourable sort of scrape, and I can  promise you we shall ask no questions if you would rather keep the  matter altogether to yourself.\"    \"No, I would rather tell you,\" Rupert said. \"I know none of you would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,".      But naturally not all the Badhaks could do things in the style of  Meherban Singh. The disguise which they most often assumed in the north  was that of carriers of Ganges water, while in Central India they often  pretended to be Banjaras travelling with pack-bullocks, or pilgrims,  or wedding-parties going to fetch the bride or bridegroom. Sometimes  also they took the character of religious mendicants, the leader being  the high priest and all the rest his followers and disciples. One  such gang, described by Colonel Sleeman, [50] had four or five  tents of white and dyed cloth, two or three pairs of _nakkaras_  or kettle-drums and trumpets, with a great number of buffaloes,  cows, goats, sheep and ponies. Some were clothed, but the bodies  of the greater part were covered with nothing but ashes, paint and  a small cloth waistband. But they always provided themselves with  five or six real Bairagis, whose services they purchased at a very  high price. These men were put forward to answer questions in case  of difficulty and to bully the landlords and peasantry; and if the  people demurred to the demands of the Badhaks, to intimidate them by  tricks calculated to play upon the fears of the ignorant. They held  in their hands a preparation of gunpowder resembling common ashes; and  when they found the people very stubborn they repeated their _mantras_  over this and threw it upon the thatch of the nearest house, to which  it set fire. The explosion was caused by a kind of fusee held in the  hand which the people could not see, and taking it for a miracle  they paid all that was demanded. Another method was to pretend to  be carrying the bones of dead relatives to the Ganges. The bones or  ashes of the deceased, says [51] Colonel Sleeman, are carried to the  Ganges in bags, coloured red for females and white for males. These  bags are considered holy, and are not allowed to touch the ground  upon the way, and during halts in the journey are placed on poles or  triangles. The carriers are regarded with respect as persons engaged  upon a pious duty, and seldom questioned on the road. When a gang  assumed this disguise they proceeded to their place of rendezvous  in small parties, some with red and some with white bags, in which  they carried the bones of animals most resembling those of the human  frame. These were supported on triangles formed of the shafts on which  the spear-heads would be fitted when they reached their destination  and had prepared for action.        6. Countenance and support of landowners.      It would have been impossible for the Badhaks to exist and flourish  as they did without the protection of the landowners on whose estates  they lived; and this they received in full measure in return for a  liberal share of their booty. When the chief of Karauli was called upon  to dislodge a gang within his territory, he expressed apprehension  that the coercion of the Badhaks might cause a revolution in the  State. He was not at all singular, says Colonel Sleeman, in his fear  of exasperating this formidable tribe of robbers. It was common to  all the smaller chiefs and the provincial governors of the larger  ones. They everywhere protected and fostered the Badhaks, as did the  landholders; and the highest of them associated with the leaders of  gangs on terms of equality and confidence. It was very common for a  chief or the governor of a district in times of great difficulty and  personal danger to require from one of the leaders of such gangs a  night-guard or _palang ki chauki_: and no less so to entertain large  bodies of them in the attack and defence of forts and camps whenever  unusual courage and skill were required. The son of the Raja of Charda  exchanged turbans with a Badhak leader, Mangal Singh, as a mark of the  most intimate friendship. This episode recalls an alliance of similar  character in _Lorna Doone_; and indeed it would not be difficult to  find several points of resemblance between the careers of the more  enterprising Badhak leaders and the Doones of Bagworthy; but India  produced no character on the model of John Ridd, and it was reserved  for an Englishman, Colonel Sleeman, to achieve the suppression of the  Badhaks as well as that of the Thugs. After the fortress and territory  of Garhakota in Saugor had been taken by the Maharaja Sindhia, Zalim  Singh, a cousin of the dispossessed Bundela chief, collected a force  of Bundelas and Pindaris and ravaged the country round Garhakota  in 1813. In the course of his raid he sacked and burnt the town  of Deori, and 15,000 persons perished in the flames. Colonel Jean  Baptiste, Sindhia's general, obtained a number of picked Badhaks from  Rajputana and offered them a rich reward for the head of Zalim Singh;  and after watching his camp for three months they managed to come on  him asleep in the tent of a dancing-girl, who was following his camp,  and stabbed him to the heart. For this deed they received Rs. 20,000  from Baptiste with other valuable presents. Their reputation was  indeed such that they were frequently employed at this period both by  chiefs who desired to take the lives of others and by those who were  anxious for the preservation of their own. When it happened that a  gang was caught after a robbery in a native State, the custom was  not infrequently to make them over to the merchant whose property  they had taken, with permission to keep them in confinement until  they should refund his money; and in this manner by giving up the  whole or a part of the proceeds of their robbery they were enabled  to regain their liberty. Even if they were sent before the courts,  justice was at that time so corrupt as to permit of easy avenues of  escape for those who could afford to pay; and Colonel Sleeman records  the deposition of a Badhak describing their methods of bribery:  \"When police officers arrest Badhaks their old women get round them  and give them large sums of money; and they either release them or  get their depositions so written that their release shall be ordered  by the magistrates. If they are brought to court, their old women,  dressed in rags, follow them at a distance of three or four miles  with a thousand or two thousand rupees upon ponies; and these rupees  they distribute among the native officers of the court and get the  Badhaks released. These old women first ascertain from the people of  the villages who are the Nazirs and Munshis of influence, and wait  upon them at their houses and make their bargains. If the officials  cannot effect their release, they take money from the old women and  send them off to the Sadar Court, with letters of introduction to their  friends, and advice as to the rate they shall pay to each according  to his supposed influence. This is the way that all our leaders get  released, and hardly any but useless men are left in confinement.\" [52]        7. Pride in their profession.      It may be noticed that these robbers took the utmost pleasure in their  calling, and were most averse to the idea of giving it up and taking  to honest pursuits. \"Some of the men with me,\" one magistrate wrote,  [53] \"have been in jail for twenty, and one man for thirty years,  and still do not appear to have any idea of abandoning their illegal  vocation; even now, indeed, they look on what we consider an honest  means of livelihood with the most marked contempt; and in relating  their excursions talk of them with the greatest pleasure, much in  the way an eager sportsman describes a boar-chase or fox-hunt. While  talking of their excursions, which were to me really very interesting,  their eyes gleamed with pleasure; and beating their hands on their  foreheads and breasts and muttering some ejaculation they bewailed  the hardness of their lot, which now ensured their never again being  able to participate in such a joyous occupation.\" Another Badhak,  on being examined, said he could not recall a case of one of the  community having ever given up the trade of dacoity. \"None ever did,  I am certain of it,\" he continued. [54] \"After having been arrested,  on our release we frequently take lands, to make it appear we have  left off dacoity, but we never do so in reality; it is only done as  a feint and to enable our zamindars (landowners) to screen us.\" They  sometimes paid rent for their land at the rate of thirty rupees  an acre, in return for the countenance and protection afforded by  the zamindars. \"Our profession,\" another Badhak remarked, [55] \"has  been a _Padshahi Kam_ (a king's trade); we have attacked and seized  boldly the thousands and hundreds of thousands that we have freely  and nobly spent; we have been all our lives wallowing in wealth and  basking in freedom, and find it hard to manage with the few copper  pice a day we get from you.\" At the time when captures were numerous,  and the idea was entertained of inducing the dacoits to settle in  villages and supporting them until they had been trained to labour,  several of them, on being asked how much they would require to support  themselves, replied that they could not manage on less than two rupees  a day, having earned quite that sum by dacoity. This amount would be  more than twenty times the wages of an ordinary labourer at the same  period. Another witness put the amount at one to two rupees a day,  remarking, 'We are great persons for eating and drinking, and we keep  several wives according to our means.' Of some of them Colonel Sleeman  had a high opinion, and he mentions the case of one man, Ajit Singh,  who was drafted into the native army and rose to be commander of a  company. \"I have seldom seen a man,\" he wrote, [56] \"whom I would  rather have with me in scenes of peril and difficulty.\" An attempt of  the King of Oudh's, however, to form a regiment of Badhaks had ended  in failure, as after a short time they mutinied, beat their commandant  and other officers and turned them out of the regiment, giving "]]]
