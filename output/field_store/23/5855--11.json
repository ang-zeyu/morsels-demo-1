To return to the election of 1830.  During seven days the town was kept  at fever-heat, each day its intensity becoming heightened.  Denison, in  his opening address on 'Change, on the 14th October, in appealing to the  constituency for support, avowed himself entitled to it, not only as  being Mr. Huskisson's friend--\"the friend of your friend\"--but an  enthusiastic admirer of his principles.  Mr. Denison was son-in-law to  the Duke of Portland.  Mr. Ewart was a townsman, and a barrister, and had  represented the town of Bletchingly (or Bl_ee_ching_ly_, as they call it  in Surrey), so that both candidates came well recommended.  The writ was  moved for in the House of Commons on the 17th November, and received in  Liverpool on the Friday following.  An army of canvassers was organised  on both sides, who plied their vocations in all directions.  Mr.  Denison's friends mustered on Tuesday morning, 23rd November, in front of  Mr. Bolton's house in Duke-street, and moved in grand procession to the  Town Hall.  Amongst them were Mr. Bolton, Mr. Gladstone, Sir J. Tobin,  Messrs. Wm. Brown, Ritson, Shand, and Garnett.  Mr. Ewart's friends met  opposite to the Adelphi Hotel.  The horses were taken from Mr. Ewart's  carriage, which was then drawn by the people.  With Mr. Ewart were  Messrs. J. Brancker, Hugh Jones, W. Wallace Currie, W. Earle, jun., Hall  (barrister), Captain Colquitt, Rev. Wm. Shepherd, etc.  The processions  were both got up in admirable style; splendid and costly banners and  flags of all descriptions were displayed, while ribbons, of which  Denison's were scarlet, and Ewart's blue, fluttered in the wind in all  directions.  The following was the result of the polls.  I give it to  show how remarkably close the contest was carried on, and how the tide of  favour ebbed and flowed: 1st day--Denison, 260; Ewart, 248.  2nd  day--Denison, 583; Ewart, 568.  3rd day--Denison, 930; Ewart, 918.  4th  day--Denison; 1320; Ewart, 1308.  5th day--Denison, 1700; Ewart, 1688.  6th day--Denison, 2020; Ewart, 2008.  7th day--Denison, 2186; Ewart,  2215.  The number of freemen who voted was 4401.    If ever a borough deserved disfranchising, it was Liverpool on that  election.  The conduct of the freemen was atrocious.  I speak of them as  a body.  The bribery on that occasion was so broad, barefaced, and  unblushingly carried on, as to excite disgust in all thoughtful men's  minds.  Sums of money 3 to 100 pounds were said to have been given for  votes, and I recollect that after the heat of the election had subsided,  a list of those who voted was published, with the sums attached, which  were paid to and received by each freeman.  I have a copy of it in my  possession.  Whether true or false who can tell?  Where there is fire  there will be smoke.  It is a well-known fact that many of the canvassers  never looked behind them after that memorable time, and numbers of  tradesmen signally benefited by the money that was spread about with such  liberal hands.  In some cases money was received by freemen from both  parties.  In one case I find a man (among the H's) voting for Mr.  Denison, who received 35 and 10 pounds.  Amongst the C's was a recipient  of 28 and 25 pounds from each side; and another, a Mr. C., took 50 pounds  from Denison and 15 pounds from Ewart, the said voter being a  chimney-sweeper, and favouring Mr. Denison with the weight of his  influence and the honour of his suffrage.  In looking over the list I  find that the principal recipients of the good things going, were ropers,  coopers, sailmakers, and shipwrights.  Yet the name of \"merchant\" and  \"tradesman\" not unfrequently occurs in the descriptions of borough  voters.  Amongst the W's there appears to be scarcely a voter that  escaped \"the gold fever.\"  Amongst others who declined taking any part in  the election was Mr. Brooks Yates; he, feeling so disgusted with the  veniality of the voters, and the bribery that was going on, publicly  protested on the seventh day against the conduct of all parties, and said  \"he lifted up his voice against the practice of bribery, which was so  glaringly exercised, and which had been carried on by both parties to the  utmost extent.  The friends of Mr. Ewart had made use of his name to fill  up their complement without his authority, and he begged to withdraw it,  for he was resolved to remain decidedly neutral.  The corruption was so  gross and flagrant that he would not give his vote on either side.\"  It  is said that this election cost upwards of 100,000 pounds, of which sum  Colonel Bolton supplied 10,000 pounds.  Mr. Ewart's family it was  understood, entirely furnished his expenses amounting to 65,000 pounds.  Mr. Denison's reached from 47,000 to 50,000 pounds.    Amongst those who addressed the various meetings during the week of the  election, and previous to the commencement of the polling, were Mr.  William Rathbone, Mr. Henderson, barrister (afterwards recorder), Rev. W.  Shepherd, Captain Colquitt, Mr. James Brancker (who proposed and seconded  Mr. Ewart), and Mr. Falvey.  The orators on the part of Mr. Denison were,  Mr. Edward Rushton (afterwards stipendiary magistrate), Messrs. Shand, W.  Brown (now Sir William Brown), John Bolton, W. Earle, Leyland, Sir John  Tobin, etc.  About the fourth day of the election the real excitement  commenced, and the baneful system of bribery was resorted to.  On the  fifth day the prices of votes advanced from 20 to 25 pounds, and as much  as 40 to 50 pounds were asked and obtained.  It was expected that on the  sixth day the contest would close, but it seemed to be then continued  with unabated vigour.  On the seventh day voters were brought from all  parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, and wherever they could be met with.  The tricks played by both parties on voters were most amusing, either to  deter or compel them to vote.  Nearly four hundred freemen declined or  were unable to record their votes.    Even in the elections for mayor the most inconceivable interest was  excited, and in one case, that of 1828, between Messrs. Porter and  Robinson, from 16,000 to 20,000 pounds, if not a larger sum, was said to  have been expended in carrying the day.  I recollect a worthy  tobacconist, who kept a little shop in the town, who had a vote and was  not inclined to sell it cheap.  In every insidious way was he assailed to  part with his vote.  On the occasion of this election the list of voters  was rapidly running out to the last drop; the hour of closing the poll  was approaching, and it was found impossible to keep the poll open  another day.  \"Come, Mr. Pipes, what about your vote?--it's half-past  three!\"  \"Call again in a quarter of an hour.\"  In this quarter of an  hour the little tobacconist's shop was besieged by canvassers on both  sides, when the tempting sum of 30 pounds was reached.  The cunning  little Abel Drugger knew his value, but no higher sum would either party  advance.  Pipes had, unfortunately, gone into the back part of his shop  for a few minutes, when a wag put his clock back thirteen minutes.  Keeping his eye, while in the shop, on the clock, every now and  then--although, as he admitted afterwards, it seemed a long quarter of an  hour--he still kept off his persecutors.  When the hand approached the  quarter on the false-telling dial, one canvasser, bolder than the rest,  laid 35 pounds on a box of cigars, as the bid for it.  But Master Pipes  only was sold, for just as he was about to take up the tissue paper  bearing the magic name of Henry Hase, St. George's church struck four,  and the prize was re-pocketed to the great discomfiture of \"Pipes,\" and  the merriment of his customers.  Of electioneering tricks I could tell a  full score.    The practice of the \"Duello\" is, happily, now gone quite out of fashion,  but in my young days any and every occasion of offence was seized upon as  a _casus belli_.  Duels were fought on the most frivolous occasions and  for the slightest possible affronts, intentional or supposititious.    This taste has subsided, as well as that for hard drinking.  I can  remember both being carried to a lamentable state of excess; but these  practices have grown out of date.  I have seen, thank goodness, other  equally salutary improvements in morals, customs, and manners.    Two remarkable hostile meetings, I recollect, took place in Liverpool at  the commencement of the present century, and caused an immense sensation,  from the known position and high standing of all the parties concerned.    The first duel I shall mention was that between Mr. Sparling, late of St.  Domingo House, Everton, and Mr. Grayson, an eminent shipbuilder.  Both  gentlemen moved in the first circles of society in the town.  It took  place on the 24th of February, 1804.    The occasion of the duel was a conversation that occurred in Mr.  Grayson's carriage, between that gentleman and Major Brooks (who was shot  by Colonel Bolton in the ensuing year), on their way to dine at Mr.  Grayson's, at Wavertree.  Mr. Grayson, it seems, called Mr. Sparling \"a  villain,\" for breaking off the marriage between himself and a relative of  Mr. Grayson's.  Major Brooks repeated this conversation to Mr. Sparling,  who instantly commenced a correspondence with Mr. Grayson, calling upon  him to apologise for his language.  This correspondence continued from  October until the time the duel was fought--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#13)"],[1,"hours, for fear it should be a trap.\"    Mr Rogers opened his glass, and looked at the fallen game; and sure  enough there sat the vultures in a ring, contemplating the sticks that  the General had stuck up round it, but not one went near.    The Zulu smiled as he came up, bearing the delicate portions of the gnu  skewered upon one of his assegais; and hurrying back to the camp, Peter  and Dirk were given full directions which way to go, and sent off with  three oxen, and a roughly-contrived carriage for the game formed by  cutting down a great forked branch of a tree to attach to the oxen  yokes.  But when ready for starting they suggested the advisability of  their having guns, which being supplied, they started off, looking  rather longingly though at the preparations for breakfast.    A good fire was burning, and coffee was made, Dinny looking very  disconsolate and miserable; but the sight of the fresh meat seemed to do  him good, for a broad grin expanded his features, and getting the  frying-pan out of the box that held the cooking apparatus, he soon had  some savoury morsels peppered, salted, and sputtering on the fire.    \"I feel as if I could eat heaps,\" said Jack.  \"Oh, I say, father, isn't  breakfast lovely out here under these green trees?\"    Mr Rogers agreed that it was; and certainly nothing could have been  more glorious than the scene--the deep blue sky, the glorious sunshine,  the bright green of the trees, the chirping, whistling, and screaming of  the birds that thronged the brambles, and above all the delicious  fragrance of the endless flowering shrubs and flowers.    It was all enjoyable in the extreme, the abundant breakfast adding  wonderfully to the pleasure.  Even the oxen and horses seemed perfectly  happy, for there was an abundance of short, sweet grass for them to  crop, while the little Zulu party seemed happiness itself.    A goodly portion of the gnu had been given over to the General, and  despising the frying-pan, he and his boys toasted the pieces of flesh in  the fire, and ate them hissing hot; the effect upon Coffee being that he  did nothing but grin, and rub the portion of his brown person which he  called his \"tum-tum,\" while his brother gave vent to his excitement and  pleasure by either lying down and rolling himself over and over, or else  by trying to stand upon his head, a very agreeable style of acrobatic  trick, but decidedly inconvenient at breakfast-time.    As, however, just when he had arrived at a perfect equilibrium, and had  his heels straight up in the air, he overbalanced himself, and instead  of coming back upon his toes he went over upon his heels, which he  planted in the hot ashes, Chicory thought the performance had gone  sufficiently far, and went on eating his breakfast in what Dinny called  a more Chrishtanly-like way.    Just as they had finished, and Jack had thoroughly recovered from a  violent fit of coughing and choking, consequent upon seeing Chicory  stick his heels in the fire, while he--Jack--was drinking his coffee,  there came from behind them the crack of a whip, and Peter's harsh voice  shouting, \"Trek, boys! trek!\" accompanied by the rustling, scrambling  noise made by a great branch being drawn over the ground; and directly  after the slow, patient oxen came into sight, chewing away at their  cuds, as they used their tails to whisk away the flies, and dragged  Jack's game into camp.    It proved to be a splendid young gnu, and the boys examined with  curiosity its shaggy head, with its curiously bent down and curved up  horns, and general likeness to horse, antelope, and bull, as if it were  related to each.  Then the Zulu, with Dirk's help, rapidly skinned it;  portions were set apart for immediate use, some of the best cut up in  strips by the General, and hung in the sun upon the bushes to form what  is called \"biltong,\" that is, strips of sun-dried meat, the sun baking  it up so quickly that it has not time to go bad, and the rest was left  for another fate.    For it was most amusing to watch the dogs, sitting all four in a row,  hungrily looking at the skinning and cutting up of the gnu.  They  watched with the most intense interest the whole process, following the  General to and fro, and thankfully swallowing any scraps he threw them.    When the skin was taken off and spread upon the waggon-tilt to dry,  Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus followed, as if to see that it was properly  spread out, Rough'un being the only one who protested against the plan,  for his look plainly said that he wanted to lick that skin on the fleshy  side; and as he was not allowed to go through that process, he kept  uttering low, dissatisfied whines, to Jack's great delight; while, when  he saw Peter climb up, and Dirk hand him the skin, he uttered a yell of  disappointment at what he evidently considered to be the waste of so  much good fat.    This yell from Rough'un had its effects upon Pompey, Caesar, and  Crassus, which triumvirate did not behave at all after the manner of the  stolid, patient, noble Romans whose names they bore; but one and all set  up their noses as high as they could, getting mouth and throat in a  direct line, and sang a trio--but so dolefully out of tune, that Dinny  picked up the General's assegai, and gave each one a tap on the head  with the handle.    At least he meant to do so.  He certainly hit Pompey and Caesar sounding  cracks; but Crassus made a movement, and received his blow on the neck--  so unfair a place, he evidently supposed, that it roused his temper, and  he snapped at and seized the handle of the assegai in his teeth.    Now Dinny's hands were greasy with helping to skin the gnu, and the  handle of the assegai kept slipping through his fingers, and threatening  to cut them against the blade; to avoid which, as the dog tugged  fiercely and dragged at the handle, Dinny kept taking a fresh hold hand  over hand, as if he were hauling rope, abusing the dog at the same time.    \"Ah, get out, ye dirty baste,\" he cried.  \"Let go, will ye?\"    _Worry_! _worry_! _worry_! growled Crassus, holding on with all his  might of jaw, which was really great; and seeing the successful effort  made by their companion, Pompey and Caesar began to bark and bay at  Dinny on either side of Crassus.    \"Oh, here's a game, Dick!\" cried Jack, holding his sides and laughing.    \"Call 'em off, will ye?\" cried Dinny.  \"Ah, get out, ye dirty, yelping  bastes.\"    \"Serve you right, for hitting them in that cruel way,\" said Dick  cynically; while seeing the fun, as they seemed to consider it, Coffee  and Chicory each seized his kiri, and began to perform a war-dance round  Dinny and the dogs.    \"Lave go, will ye?\" cried Dinny to Crassus.  \"Sure it's a taste of the  other end I'll be giving ye dreckerly.\"    Crassus evidently believed him, for he held on all the tighter.  Dinny  dragged hard, but the dog's jaws had closed upon the wood like a steel  trap, and though Dinny dragged him here and there, he did not leave go;  and so sure as the man began to obtain a little advantage, Pompey and  Caesar made such a desperate attack upon his rear that he immediately  lost ground, and the French and English tug-of-war continued, the dogs  barking, Dinny abusing them, and the boys, black as well as white,  shouting with delight.    This was very good fun for the latter, but anything but pleasant for  Dinny.  In fact, so bad was his case, and so threatening the aspect of  the dogs, that any one who would have insured the legs of Dinny's  trousers from being torn by the dogs, would have been guilty of a very  insane act, especially as Rough'un, after sitting up on end encouraging  Crassus to hold on to the assegai staff by a loud bark now and then,  suddenly took it into his head to join in the fray.    For Dinny had not been particularly friendly to him since they started.  Upon one occasion Dinny had tickled him--so he called it--with Peter's  whip, the tickling consisting in giving the dog so severe a flick that  it seemed like taking out a piece of the flesh; while no later than that  morning Rough'un felt that he had been misused in the matter of the skin  that he wanted to lick.    So, unable to bear matters any longer, Rough'un, who had momentarily  grown more excited, suddenly made an open-mouthed onslaught upon the  assegai stock.    \"Carl him off, Masther Dick, Masther Jack.  Oh, murther, what'll I do.  Ah! get out--get--\"    Dinny said no more, but loosed his hold of the assegai, and fled,  leaping on to the front box of the waggon, and then climbing in beneath  the tilt, while the dogs chased him, barking and baying him furiously.    This did not last, however, for the denuding of the gnu's bones was  pretty well ended, and one of the oxen dragged the remains into the  forest, when the dogs were called up, and Dinny was forgotten.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    A BUFFALO RUN.    The General owned that there would be good hunting here, but he wanted  to get the party well into the interior, where, taking up a central  position, they could make excursions in any direction according to the  way in which the game lay.  If they stayed where they were, all they  would do would be to drive the game away, and it would grow more scarce.    The boys were as eager as the General, and looking upon the interior as  a land of mystery and romance, they readily backed up the proposal to go  farther.    \"Well, my boys, I hardly know what to say,\" replied Mr Rogers.  \"I want  for you both to grow sturdy, manly, and inured to danger; but I scarcely  like running the risk of taking you where we may be constantly  encountering the lion, the rhinoceros, and the elephant and  hippopotamus.\"    \"But we shall be very careful,\" said Jack.    \"And we are growing better marksmen every day, father,\" exclaimed Dick.    \"Yes, my boys, I dare say you are,\" replied Mr Rogers.  \"But please  remember that taking aim at and shooting a timid deer is one thing;  standing"]]]
