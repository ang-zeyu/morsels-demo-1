The materials for  both background and pattern must first be carefully cut out. It is a  good plan, where possible, to cut the two together so as to ensure exact  similarity, for they have to fit together afterwards like the parts of a  puzzle. The cut edges cannot be allowed to fray, so if there is any  danger of this, precautions must be taken to prevent it, though the  better way is to choose in the first place more suitable material.  Leather is a particularly good example of one. Any pasting or backing  which might be used for prevention of fraying would prevent also that  possibility of exposing both sides of the work, which in inlay is  sometimes a valuable quality; also, the stiffening which unavoidably  results from pasting is rarely an improvement. When materials of  different thicknesses are used together, the thinner one can be lined  with fine holland so as to make it nearer equal in strength. After the  materials are cut out the next process is to lay them in position on the  prepared holland and tack them to it. Then, with an overcast stitch that  must not be allowed to pierce the under surface, join all the edges  together, and cover the stitches with a finishing cord or braid. The  backing can now be removed if need be.      PATCHWORK    Patchwork can hardly attain to a high position amongst the various  branches of embroidery. The main object of doing patchwork frequently is  to make good use of valuable scraps of waste material. Unless, however,  the product shows evidence of well thought out colour and arrangement,  it cannot come under the heading of embroidery. Interesting results,  however, of many kinds can be produced from this paint-box of brightly  coloured scraps of material by ingenious mixing and shaping of them.  Patchwork infers a rather more mosaic-like design than inlaid work, to  which it is in some respects similar. The geometrically planned mosaic  and inlay pavements that are to be seen so commonly in Italy and the  East suggest great variety of patterns that could be applied to  patchwork. The illustration at fig. 97 is a simple example taken from  this source. Too often the results are only \"alarming,\" as the Countess  of Wilton expressively puts it, thinking, probably, of the patterns  frequently seen upon cushions, patterns more resembling bright-coloured  bricks set in cornerwise than anything else. They are the most unrestful  looking things imaginable. The important elements of the work lie in the  colour, shape, and texture of the pieces used, for upon the right  selection the result wholly depends. The shapes chosen must be simple  owing to the necessity of fitting and stitching them together, but there  is plenty of variety obtainable with simplicity. The design may consist  of one shape repeated or several. If only one, it is limited to a few  geometrical figures, such as the square, hexagon, or shell shape; if  more than one, there can be greater variety of pattern. Fig. 98 is an  example in which four shapes are made use of, a large and small circle,  an octagon, and an S-like twist. Four of these twists together make the  figure that interlaces over the surface. Embroidery stitching can be  added to patchwork; for instance, this example might have a neat border  pattern worked on all the S-shapes, as suggested in the diagram, which  would probably considerably increase its interest. Fig. 99 shows flowers  springing from the base of the shell-form in use upon it. The embroidery  could be simply carried out in one colour, or if a more gorgeous result  were required, variety could be introduced in this way as well as in the  ground, and a marvellous combination of intricate colour could be thus  produced.    [Illustration: Fig. 97.]    [Illustration: Fig. 98.]    For the work to be made up satisfactorily it is necessary that the  shapes be accurately cut out. To ensure this, a metal plate is cut and  all the shapes are taken from it; sometimes, in lieu of this, a pattern  is cut out in stiff cardboard. Lay this pattern-shape on the wrong side  of the material and pencil it round, then carefully cut out the stuff,  leaving about a quarter of an inch for turning in. Next lay the  pattern-shape upon a piece of stiff paper or thin card-board and again  trace off the shape, this time cutting it out exactly to the pattern,  tack the material to the paper, and stitch down the raw edges at the  back. Lay the prepared patches on a table and put them in place by  referring to the design, and then commence sewing the edges together  with an overcast stitch on the wrong side. When all are sewn, remove the  papers and flatten the seams with an iron. Any braid or stitch that may  be required to mask the join is next put on; this may be made ornamental  by interlacing knots at the corners, or by any other device that happens  to suit the work. The last thing to be done is to put a neat lining upon  the back to cover and protect the numerous raw edges.

CHAPTER IX    METHODS OF WORK--(_continued_)       Quilting--Raised Work--Darning--Open Fillings--Darned Netting.      Quilting is a method of working by which three materials are fixed  together by more or less all-over stitching. It probably developed  through the necessity of keeping the three layers in place. For  practical purposes only, the sewing machine does the work excellently,  but by making the stitching follow out some prearranged design, it is  raised to the level of art. Plate III. is an interesting example showing  what can be done in the way of design with the stitching over the  surface. Embroidery may be added to the quilting, and this is often an  improvement. The Eastern nations carry out marvellously intricate  designs in quilting, and English XVIIIth century work of this kind shows  Eastern influence strongly. A good example of this is a very interesting  piece in the Victoria and Albert Museum.[5]    The first aim in quilting was evidently warmth, and the name denotes one  of the chief uses to which it is put. It is made use of also for  curtains, infants' caps or gloves (see fig. 100), all these things  requiring the three layers for warmth. The materials usually consist of  a surface one, which can be silk, fine linen or anything else; an  interlining of some softer material having a certain amount of spring in  it, such as flannel, cotton wadding, or wool; and for the third, an  underneath lining of some kind. A cord is sometimes inserted instead of  the inner layer of stuff, the lines of stitching running along either  side to keep it in place. Occasionally there are only the top and the  under layer, with no intervening material. The stitch usually employed  is a running, back, or chain stitch, and it can be of the colour of  the surface, or a contrast to it. Gold silk is often seen upon a white  linen ground. The chief interest in the work lies in the choice of  pattern, such things as colour, variety of stitching, interest in  material, are not made much of. In planning the pattern, use is made of  the knowledge that the closely stitched parts will lie more flatly, so  it frequently happens that the ground has a small diaper running over  it, and the pattern part, being less worked upon, perhaps only outlined,  stands out more and forms an effective contrast.    [Illustration: Fig. 100.]      RAISED WORK    In the XIVth century raised work was commonly done, but few examples are  known of date earlier than this. The raised effect is obtained by an  interposed layer of padding, which is a good method of getting a certain  kind of effect. It is perhaps wise to err on the side of too little  rather than too much relief. An example of too much and also of a wrong  kind is the English stump work that was popular in the XVIIth century,  when figures were stuffed like dolls, the clothes made separately and  attached, even to the shoes and stockings. Germain de St. Aubin, writing  in 1769, describes with much admiration a kind of _broderie en ronde  bosse_, apparently much the same thing and in equally doubtful taste,  though the skill required to carry it out must have been considerable.    The work, usually done in a frame, must be well carried out technically;  the padding should be quite perfect in the form required before the  final surface layer is worked over it, for this one will not make any  deficiency right, but will only serve to show it up the more. Another  point to be careful about is to make the padding stop well within the  traced line of the pattern, otherwise the finished design will turn out  much larger than was originally intended. The outline is sometimes  worked round at the commencement, whereby its correctness is ensured.    [Illustration: Fig. 101.]    [Illustration: Fig. 102.]    Many different materials are brought into use for padding purposes. One  of the simplest and most durable is a running of thread as illustrated  in fig. 101. The thread can be arranged so as to be thicker in the  centre than at the edges by laying some extra stitches over that part.  If a quite flat padding is required, the shape, cut out in cloth, felt,  or parchment, is attached by stitches to the material as shown in fig.  102; the surface stitching would be taken across it. Cardboard,  sometimes pasted on to the ground, is used for this purpose, but it is  unsatisfactory in several ways; for instance, cardboard letters are  procurable for embroidering initials upon linen, but they are not at all  practical for anything that goes through the wash; moreover, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#13)"],[1,"merely of the three words--    IBI CUBAVIT LAMIA.          THE STORY OF A DISAPPEARANCE  AND AN APPEARANCE          THE STORY OF A DISAPPEARANCE  AND AN APPEARANCE      The letters which I now publish were sent to me recently by a person  who knows me to be interested in ghost stories. There is no doubt  about their authenticity. The paper on which they are written, the  ink, and the whole external aspect put their date beyond the reach of  question.    The only point which they do not make clear is the identity of the  writer. He signs with initials only, and as none of the envelopes of  the letters are preserved, the surname of his correspondent--obviously  a married brother--is as obscure as his own. No further preliminary  explanation is needed, I think. Luckily the first letter supplies all  that could be expected.      LETTER I                GREAT CHRISHALL, _Dec. 22, 1837_.    MY DEAR ROBERT,--It is with great regret for the enjoyment I am  losing, and for a reason which you will deplore equally with myself,  that I write to inform you that I am unable to join your circle for  this Christmas: but you will agree with me that it is unavoidable when  I say that I have within these few hours received a letter from Mrs.  Hunt at B----, to the effect that our Uncle Henry has suddenly and  mysteriously disappeared, and begging me to go down there immediately  and join the search that is being made for him. Little as I, or you  either, I think, have ever seen of Uncle, I naturally feel that this  is not a request that can be regarded lightly, and accordingly I  propose to go to B---- by this afternoon's mail, reaching it late in  the evening. I shall not go to the Rectory, but put up at the King's  Head, and to which you may address letters. I enclose a small draft,  which you will please make use of for the benefit of the young people.  I shall write you daily (supposing me to be detained more than a  single day) what goes on, and you may be sure, should the business be  cleared up in time to permit of my coming to the Manor after all, I  shall present myself. I have but a few minutes at disposal. With  cordial greetings to you all, and many regrets, believe me, your  affectionate Bro.,    W. R.      LETTER II                KING'S HEAD, _Dec. 23, '37_.    MY DEAR ROBERT,--In the first place, there is as yet no news of Uncle  H., and I think you may finally dismiss any idea--I won't say  hope--that I might after all \"turn up\" for Xmas. However, my thoughts  will be with you, and you have my best wishes for a really festive  day. Mind that none of my nephews or nieces expend any fraction of  their guineas on presents for me.    Since I got here I have been blaming myself for taking this affair of  Uncle H. too easily. From what people here say, I gather that there is  very little hope that he can still be alive; but whether it is  accident or design that carried him off I cannot judge. The facts are  these. On Friday the 19th, he went as usual shortly before five  o'clock to read evening prayers at the Church; and when they were over  the clerk brought him a message, in response to which he set off to  pay a visit to a sick person at an outlying cottage the better part of  two miles away. He paid the visit, and started on his return journey  at about half-past six. This is the last that is known of him. The  people here are very much grieved at his loss; he had been here many  years, as you know, and though, as you also know, he was not the most  genial of men, and had more than a little of the _martinet_ in his  composition, he seems to have been active in good works, and unsparing  of trouble to himself.    Poor Mrs. Hunt, who has been his housekeeper ever since she left  Woodley, is quite overcome: it seems like the end of the world to her.  I am glad that I did not entertain the idea of taking quarters at the  Rectory; and I have declined several kindly offers of hospitality from  people in the place, preferring as I do to be independent, and finding  myself very comfortable here.    You will, of course, wish to know what has been done in the way of  inquiry and search. First, nothing was to be expected from  investigation at the Rectory; and to be brief, nothing has transpired.  I asked Mrs. Hunt--as others had done before--whether there was either  any unfavourable symptom in her master such as might portend a sudden  stroke, or attack of illness, or whether he had ever had reason to  apprehend any such thing: but both she, and also his medical man, were  clear that this was not the case. He was quite in his usual health.  In the second place, naturally, ponds and streams have been dragged,  and fields in the neighbourhood which he is known to have visited  last, have been searched--without result. I have myself talked to the  parish clerk and--more important--have been to the house where he paid  his visit.    There can be no question of any foul play on these people's part. The  one man in the house is ill in bed and very weak: the wife and the  children of course could do nothing themselves, nor is there the  shadow of a probability that they or any of them should have agreed to  decoy poor Uncle H. out in order that he might be attacked on the way  back. They had told what they knew to several other inquirers already,  but the woman repeated it to me. The Rector was looking just as usual:  he wasn't very long with the sick man--\"He ain't,\" she said, \"like  some what has a gift in prayer; but there, if we was all that way,  'owever would the chapel people get their living?\" He left some money  when he went away, and one of the children saw him cross the stile  into the next field. He was dressed as he always was: wore his  bands--I gather he is nearly the last man remaining who does so--at  any rate in this district.    You see I am putting down everything. The fact is that I have nothing  else to do, having brought no business papers with me; and, moreover,  it serves to clear my own mind, and may suggest points which have been  overlooked. So I shall continue to write all that passes, even to  conversations if need be--you may read or not as you please, but pray  keep the letters. I have another reason for writing so fully, but it  is not a very tangible one.    You may ask if I have myself made any search in the fields near the  cottage. Something--a good deal--has been done by others, as I  mentioned; but I hope to go over the ground to-morrow. Bow Street has  now been informed, and will send down by to-night's coach, but I do  not think they will make much of the job. There is no snow, which  might have helped us. The fields are all grass. Of course I was on the  _qui vive_ for any indication to-day both going and returning; but  there was a thick mist on the way back, and I was not in trim for  wandering about unknown pastures, especially on an evening when bushes  looked like men, and a cow lowing in the distance might have been the  last trump. I assure you, if Uncle Henry had stepped out from among  the trees in a little copse which borders the path at one place,  carrying his head under his arm, I should have been very little more  uncomfortable than I was. To tell you the truth, I was rather  expecting something of the kind. But I must drop my pen for the  moment: Mr. Lucas, the curate, is announced.    _Later._ Mr. Lucas has been, and gone, and there is not much beyond  the decencies of ordinary sentiment to be got from him. I can see that  he has given up any idea that the Rector can be alive, and that, so  far as he can be, he is truly sorry. I can also discern that even in a  more emotional person than Mr. Lucas, Uncle Henry was not likely to  inspire strong attachment.    Besides Mr. Lucas, I have had another visitor in the shape of my  Boniface--mine host of the \"King's Head\"--who came to see whether I  had everything I wished, and who really requires the pen of a Boz to  do him justice. He was very solemn and weighty at first. \"Well, sir,\"  he said, \"I suppose we must bow our 'ead beneath the blow, as my poor  wife had used to say. So far as I can gather there's been neither  hide nor yet hair of our late respected incumbent scented out as yet;  not that he was what the Scripture terms a hairy man in any sense of  the word.\"    I said--as well as I could--that I supposed not, but could not help  adding that I had heard he was sometimes a little difficult to deal  with. Mr. Bowman looked at me sharply for a moment, and then passed in  a flash from solemn sympathy to impassioned declamation. \"When I  think,\" he said, \"of the language that man see fit to employ to me in  this here parlour over no more a matter than a cask of beer--such a  thing as I told him might happen any day of the week to a man with a  family--though as it turned out he was quite under a mistake, and that  I knew at the time, only I was that shocked to hear him I couldn't lay  my tongue to the right expression.\"    He stopped abruptly and eyed me with some embarrassment. I only said,  \"Dear me, I'm sorry to hear you had any little differences; I suppose  my uncle will be a good deal missed in the parish?\" Mr. Bowman drew a  long breath. \"Ah, yes!\" he said; \"your uncle! You'll understand me  when I say that for the moment it had slipped my remembrance that he  was a relative; and natural enough, I must say, as it should, for as  to you bearing any resemblance to--to him, the notion of any such a  thing is clean ridiculous. All the same, 'ad I 'ave bore it in my  mind, you'll be among the first to feel, I'm sure, as I should have  abstained my lips, or rather I should _not_ have abstained my lips  with no such reflections.\"    I assured him that I quite understood, and was going to have asked him  some further questions, but he was called away to see after some  business. By the way, you need not take it into your head that he has  anything to fear from the inquiry into poor Uncle Henry's  disappearance--thou"]]]
