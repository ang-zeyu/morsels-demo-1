One I eat in my cafe noir; one I  present to mon cher vieux, ce bon Mahan; one I keep for the grand dog  what save us all that day.\"    \"What's the idea?\" queried the mystified rookie. \"I don't--\"    \"We were stuck in the front line of the Rache salient,\" explained  Mahan, eager to recount his dog-friend's prowess. \"On both sides our  supports got word to fall back. We couldn't get the word, because our  telephone connection was knocked galley-west. There we were, waiting  for a Hun attack to wipe us out. We couldn't fall back, for they were  peppering the hillslope behind us. We were at the bottom. They'd have  cut us to ribbons if we'd shown our carcasses in the open. Bruce was  here, with a message he'd brought. The K.O. sent him back to  headquarters for the reserves. The boche heavies and snipers and  machine-guns all cut loose to stop him as he scooted up the hill. And a  measly giant of a German police dog tried to kill him, too. Bruce got  through the lot of them; and he reached headquarters with the SOS call  that saved us. The poor chap was cut and gouged and torn by bullets and  shell-scraps, and he was nearly dead from shell-shock, too. But the  surgeon general worked over him, himself, and pulled him back to life.  He--\"    \"He is a loved pet of a man and a woman in your America, I have heard  one say,\" chimed in Vivier. \"And his home, there, was in the quiet  country. He was lent to the cause, as a patriotic offering, ce brave!  And of a certainty, he has earned his welcome.\"    When Bruce, an hour later, trotted into the trenches, on the way to the  \"Here-We-Come\" colonel's quarters, he was received like a visiting  potentate. Dozens of men hailed him eagerly by name as he made his way  to his destination with the message affixed to his collar.    Many of these men were his well-remembered friends and comrades. Mahan  and Vivier, and one or two more, he had grown to like--as well as he  could like any one in that land of horrors, three thousand miles away  from The Place, where he was born, and from the Mistress and the  Master, who were his loyally worshiped gods.    Moreover, being only mortal and afflicted with a hearty appetite, Bruce  loved the food and other delicacies the men were forever offering him  as a variation on the stodgy fare dished out to him and his fellow  war-dogs.    As much to amuse and interest the soldiers whose hero he was, as for  any special importance in the dispatch he carried, Bruce had been sent  now to the trenches of the Here-We-Comes. It was his first visit to the  regiment he had saved, since the days of the Rache assault two months  earlier. Thanks to supremely clever surgery and to tender care, the dog  was little the worse for his wounds. His hearing gradually had come  back. In one shoulder he had a very slight stiffness which was not a  limp, and a new-healed furrow scarred the left side of his tawny coat.  Otherwise he was as good as new.    As Bruce trotted toward the group that so recently had been talking of  him, the Missouri recruit watched with interest for the dog's joy at  this reunion with his old friends. Bruce's snowy chest and  black-stippled coat were fluffed out by many recent baths. His splendid  head high and his dark eyes bright, the collie advanced toward the  group.    Mahan greeted him joyously. Vivier stretched out a hand which displayed  temptingly the long-hoarded lump of sugar. A third man produced, from  nowhere in particular, a large and meat-fringed soup-bone.    \"I wonder which of you he'll come to, first,\" said the interested  Missourian.    The question was answered at once, and right humiliatingly. For Bruce  did not falter in his swinging stride as he came abreast of the group.  Not by so much as a second glance did he notice Mahan's hail and the  tempting food.    As he passed within six inches of the lump of sugar which Vivier was  holding out to him, the dog's silken ears quivered slightly, sure sign  of hard-repressed emotion in a thoroughbred collie,--but he gave no  other manifestation that he knew any one was there.    \"Well, I'll be blessed!\" snickered the Missourian in high derision, as  Bruce passed out of sight around an angle of the trench. \"So that's the  pup who is such a pal of you fellows, is he? Gee, but it was a treat to  see how tickled he was to meet you again!\"    To the rookie's amazement none of his hearers seemed in the least  chagrined over the dogs chilling disregard of them. Instead, Mahan  actually grunted approbation.    \"He'll be back,\" prophesied the Sergeant. \"Don't you worry. He'll be  back. We ought to have had more sense than try to stop him when he's on  duty. He has better discipline than the rest of us. That's one of very  first things they teach a courier-dog--to pay no attention to anybody,  when he's on dispatch duty. When Bruce has delivered his message to the  K.O., he'll have the right to hunt up his chums. And no one knows it  better'n Bruce himself.\"    \"It was a sin--a thoughtlessness--of me to hold the sugar at him,\" said  old Vivier. \"Ah, but he is a so good soldier, ce brave Bruce! He look  not to the left nor yet to the right, nor yet to the so-desired  sugar-lump. He keep his head at attention! All but the furry tips of  his ears. Them he has not yet taught to be good soldiers. They tremble,  when he smell the sugar and the good soup-bone. They quiver like the  little leaf. But he keep on. He--\"    There was a scurry of fast-cantering feet. Around the angle of the  trench dashed Bruce. Head erect, soft dark eyes shining with a light of  gay mischief, he galloped up to the grinning Sergeant Vivier and stood.  The dog's great plume of a tail was wagging violently. His tulip ears  were cocked. His whole interest in life was fixed on the precious lump  of sugar which Vivier held out to him.    From puppyhood, Bruce had adored lump sugar. Even at The Place, sugar  had been a rarity for him, for the Mistress and the Master had known  the damage it can wreak upon a dog's teeth and digestion. Yet, once in  a while, as a special luxury, the Mistress had been wont to give him a  solitary lump of sugar.    Since his arrival in France, the dog had never seen nor scented such a  thing until now. Yet he did not jump for the gift. He did not try to  snatch it from Vivier. Instead, he waited until the old Frenchman held  it closer toward him, with the invitation:    \"Take it, mon vieux! It is for you.\"    Then and then only did Bruce reach daintily forward and grip the grimy  bit of sugar between his mighty jaws. Vivier stroked the collie's head  while Bruce wagged his tail and munched the sugar and blinked  gratefully up at the donor. Mahan looked on, enviously. \"A dog's got  forty-two teeth, instead of the thirty-two that us humans have to chew  on,\" observed the Sergeant. \"A vet' told me that once. And sugar is bad  for all forty-two of 'em. Maybe you didn't know that, Monsoo Vivier?  Likely, at this rate, we'll have to chip in before long and buy poor  Brucie a double set of false teeth. Just because you've put his real  ones out of business with lumps of sugar!\"    Vivier looked genuinely concerned at this grim forecast. Bruce wandered  across to the place where the donor of the soup-bone brandished his  offering. Other men, too, were crowding around with gifts.    Between petting and feeding, the collie spent a busy hour among his  comrades-at-arms. He was to stay with the \"Here-We-Comes\" until the  following day, and then carry back to headquarters a reconnaissance  report.    At four o'clock that afternoon the sky was softly blue and the air was  unwontedly clear. By five o'clock a gentle India-summer haze blurred  the world's sharper outlines. By six a blanket-fog rolled in, and the  air was wetly unbreatheable. The fog lay so thick over the soggy earth  that objects ten feet away were invisible.    \"This,\" commented Sergeant Mahan, \"is one of the times I was talking  about this morning--when eyes are no use. This is sure the country for  fogs, in war-time. The cockneys tell me the London fogs aren't a patch  on 'em.\"    The \"Here-We-Comes\" were encamped, for the while, at the edge of a  sector from whence all military importance had recently been removed by  a convulsive twist of a hundred-mile battle-front. In this dull  hole-in-a-corner the new-arrived rivets were in process of welding into  the more veteran structure of the mixed regiment.    Not a quarter-mile away--across No Man's Land and athwart two barriers  of barbed wire--lay a series of German trenches. Now, in all  probability, and from all outward signs, the occupants of this boche  position consisted only of a regiment or two which had been so badly  cut up, in a foiled drive, as to need a month of non-exciting routine  before going back into more perilous service.    Yet the commander of the division to which the \"Here-We-Comes\" were  attached did not trust to probabilities nor to outward signs. He had  been at the front long enough to realize that the only thing likely to  happen was the thing which seemed unlikeliest. And he felt a morbid  curiosity to learn more about the personnel of those dormant German  trenches.    Wherefore he had sent an order that a handful of the \"Here-We-Comes\" go  forth into No Man's Land, on the first favorable night, and try to pick  up a boche prisoner or two for questioning-purposes. A scouring of the  doubly wired area between the hostile lines might readily harvest some  solitary sentinel or some other man on special duty, or even the  occupants of a listening-post. And the division commander earnestly  desired to question such prisoner or prisoners. The fog furnished an  ideal night for such an expedition.    Thus it was that a very young lieutenant and Sergeant Mahan and ten  privates--the lanky Missourian among them--were detailed for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#13)"],[1,"afternoon, late in October,--one of  those days nobody wants,--the Master came home from town; his fall  overcoat showing a decided list to starboard in the shape of an  egregiously bulged side-pocket.    The Mistress and Lad, as ever, came forth to greet the returning man.  Lad, with the gayly trumpeting bark which always he reserved for the  Mistress or the Master after an absence of any length, cavorted  rapturously up to his deity. But, midway in his welcoming advance, he  checked himself; sniffing the sodden October air, and seeking to locate  a new and highly interesting scent which had just assailed his  sensitive nostrils.    The Master put an end to the mystery, forthwith, by reaching deep into  his overcoat's swollen pocket and fishing out a grayish golden ball of  squirming fluff.    This handful of liveliness he set gingerly on the veranda floor; where  it revealed itself as an eight-weeks old collie pup.    \"Her name is 'Lady,'\" expounded the Master, as he and the Mistress  gazed interestedly down upon the sprawling and wiggling puppy. \"Her  pedigree reads like a page in Burke's Peerage. She--\"    He paused. For Lad had moved forward to where the infant collie was  trying valiantly to walk on the slippery boards. The big dog regarded  the puppy; his head on one side, his tulip ears cocked; his deep-set  eyes friendily curious. This was Lad's first experience with one of the  young of his species. And he was a bit puzzled; albeit vastly  interested.    Experimentally, he laid one of his tiny white forepaws lightly on the  mite's fuzzy shoulder. Instantly, the puppy growled a falsetto warning  to him to keep his distance. Lad's plumed tail began to wag at this  sign of spirit in the pigmy. And, with his curved pink ribbon of  tongue, he essayed to lick the shivering Lady. A second growl rewarded  this attention. And Lady sought to avoid further contact with the  shaggy giant, by scrambling at top speed to the edge of the veranda.    She miscalculated the distance or else her nearsighted baby eyes failed  to take account of the four-foot drop to the gravel drive below. Too  late, she tried to check her awkward rush. And, for a moment, her fat  little body swayed perilously on the brink.    The Mistress and the Master were too far away to catch her in time to  prevent a fall which might well have entailed a broken rib or a  wrenched shoulder. But Lad was nearer. Also, he moved faster.    With the speed of lightning, he made a dive for the tumbling Lady. As  tenderly as if he were picking up a ball of needles, he caught her by  the scruff of the neck, lifting her in the air and depositing her at  the Mistress's feet.    The puppy repaid this life-saving exploit by growling still more  wrathfully and by snapping in helpless menace at the big dog's nose.  But Lad was in no wise offended. Deaf to the praise of the Mistress,--a  praise which ordinarily threw him into transports of embarrassed  delight,--he stood over the rescued pup; every inch of his magnificent  body vibrant with homage and protectiveness.    From that hour, Lad was the adoring slave of Lady.    He watched over her, in her increasingly active rambles about the  Place. Always, on the advent of doubtful strangers, he interposed his  own furry bulk between her and possible kidnaping. He stood beside her  as she lapped her bread-and-milk or as she chewed laboriously at her  fragment of dog-biscuit.    At such times, he proved himself the mortal foe of Peter Grimm, the  Mistress's temperamental gray kitten, with whom he was ordinarily on  very comfortable terms. Peter Grimm was the one creature on the Place  whom Lady feared. On the day after her arrival, she essayed to worry  the haughty catkin. And, a second later, the puppy was nursing a brace  of deep red scratches at the tip of her inquiring black nostrils.    Thereafter, she gave Peter Grimm a wide berth. And the cat was wont to  take advantage of this dread by making forays on Lady's supper dish.  But, ever, Lad would swoop down upon the marauder, as Lady cowered  whimperingly back on her haunches; and would harry the indignant cat up  the nearest tree; herding her there until Lady had licked the dish  clean.    Lad went further, in his fealty to the puppy. Sacrificing his own regal  dignity, he would romp with her, at times when it would have been far  more comfortable to drowse. He bore, without murmur, her growling  assaults on his food; amusedly standing aside while she annexed his  supper's choicest bits.    He endured, too, her occasional flurries of hot temper; and made no  protest when Lady chose to wreak some grievance against life by flying  at him with bristling ruff and jaws asnarl. Her keen little milk teeth  hurt like the mischief, when they dug into his ears or his paws, in one  of these rage-gusts. But he did not resent the pain or the indignity by  so much as drawing back out of harm's way. And, afterward, when quick  repentance replaced anger and she strove to make friends with him  again, Lad was inordinately happy.    To both the Mistress and the Master, from the very outset, it was plain  that Lady was not in any way such a dog as their beloved Lad. She was  as temperamental as Peter Grimm himself. She had hair-trigger nerves, a  swirlingly uncertain temper that was scarce atoned for by her charm and  lovableness; and she lacked Lad's stanchness and elusive semi-human  quality. The two were as different in nature as it is possible for a  couple of well-brought-up thoroughbred collies to be. And the humans'  hearts did not go out to Lady as to Lad. Still, she was an ideal pet,  in many ways. And, Lad's utter devotion to her was a full set of  credentials, by itself.    Autumn froze into winter. The trees turned into naked black ghosts; or,  rather, into many-stringed harps whereon the northwest gales  alternately shrieked and roared. The fire-blue lake was a sheet of  leaden ice, twenty inches thick. The fields showed sere and grayly  lifeless in the patches between sodden snow-swathes. Nature had flown  south, with the birds; leaving the northern world a lifeless and empty  husk, as deserted as last summer's robin-nests.    Lady, in these drear months of a dead world, changed as rapidly as had  the smiling Place. From a shapeless gray-gold fuzzy baby, she grew lank  and leggy. The indeterminate fuzz was buried under a shimmering  gold-and-white coat of much beauty. The muskrat face lengthened and  grew delicately graceful, with its long muzzle and exquisite profile.    Lady was emerging from clownish puppyhood into the charm of youth. By  the time the first anemones carried God's message of spring through the  forests' lingering snow-pall, she had lost her adolescent gawkiness and  was a slenderly beautiful young collie; small and light of bone, as she  remained to the day of her death, but with a slimness which carried  with it a hint of lithe power and speed and endurance.    It was in the early spring that the Master promoted Lady from her  winter sleeping-quarters in the tool-house; and began to let her spend  more and more time indoors.    Lady had all the promise of becoming a perfect housedog. Fastidious,  quick to learn, she adapted herself almost at once to indoor life. And  Lad was overjoyed at her admission to the domain where until now he had  ruled alone. Personally, and with the gravity of an old-world host, he  conducted her from room to room. He even offered her a snoozing-place  in his cherished \"cave,\" under the piano, in the music room the spot of  all others dearest to him.    But it was dim and cheerless, under the piano; or so Lady seemed to  think. And she would not go there for an instant. She preferred the  disreputable grizzly-bear rug in front of the living room hearth. And,  temporarily deserting his loved cave, Lad used to lie on this rug at  her side; well content when she edged him off its downy center and onto  the bumpy edges.    All winter, Lady's sleeping quarters had been the tool-house in the  back garden, behind the stables. Here, on a sweet-smelling (and  flea-averting) bed of cedar shavings, she had been comfortable and  wholly satisfied. But, at once, on her promotion, she appeared to look  upon the once-homelike tool-house as a newly rich daylaborer might  regard the tumbledown shack where he had spent the days of his poverty.    She avoided the tool-house; and even made wide detours to avoid passing  close to it. There is no more thoroughgoing snob, in certain ways, than  a high-bred dog. And, to Lady, the tool-house evidently represented a  humiliating phase of her outlived past.    Yet, she was foredoomed to go back to the loathed abode. And her return  befell in this way:    In the Master's study was something which Lady considered the most  enthrallingly wonderful object on earth. This was a stuffed American  eagle; mounted, rampant and with outflung wings, on a papier-mache  stump.    Why the eagle should have fascinated Lady more than did the  leopard-or-bear rugs or other chase-trophies, in the various downstairs  rooms, only Lady herself could have told. But she could not keep her  eyes off of it. Tiptoeing to the study door, she used to stand for half  an hour at a time staring at the giant bird.    Once, in a moment of audacity, she made a playful little rush at it.  Before the Master could intervene, Lad had dashed between her and the  sacred trophy; and had shouldered her gently but with much firmness out  of the room; disregarding her little swirl of temper at the  interference.    The Master called her back into the study. Taking her up to the eagle,  he pointed at it, and said, with slow emphasis:    \"Lady! Let it ALONE! Let--it--ALONE!\"    She understood. For, from babyhood, she had learned, by daily practice,  to understand and interpret the human voice. Politely, she backed away  from the alluring bird. Snarling slightly at Lad, as she passed him in  the doorway, she stalked out of the room and"]]]
