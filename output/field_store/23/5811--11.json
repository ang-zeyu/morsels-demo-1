With the aid of one of the  officials I found what he told me was the site, but the entire place was  densely covered with the tombs and grave-stones of later interments,  rendering the erection of a stone, however small and simple, quite out  of the question.    [48] The Rue Lamarck begins at the elevated square on which is situated  the Church of the Sacre-Coeur, now in process of erection, and from this  point one obtains a commanding and very fine view overlooking the city;  from there the street curves round to the westward, ending in the Avenue  de Saint-Ouen, and continues as a wide and long thoroughfare, ending to  the north of the cemetery of Montmartre. A neighboring street, Rue  Becquerel, is named after another French savant, and parallel to it is a  short street named Rue Darwin.    [49] Latreille was born at Brives, November 29, 1762, and died  February 6, 1833. He was the leading entomologist of his time, and to  him Cuvier was indebted for the arrangement of the insects in the _Regne  Animal_. His bust is to be seen on the same side of the Nouvelle Galerie  in the Jardin des Plantes as those of Lamarck, Cuvier, De Blainville,  and D'Orbigny. His first paper was introduced by Lamarck in 1792. In the  minutes of the session of 4 thermidor, l'an VI. (July, 1798), we find  this entry: \"The citizen Lamarck announces that the citizen Latreille  offered to the administration to work under the direction of that  professor in arranging the very numerous collection of insects of the  Museum, so as to place them under the eye of the public.\" And here he  remained until his appointment. Several years (1825) before Lamarck's  death he had asked to have Latreille fill his place in giving  instruction.    Audouin (1797-1841), also an eminent entomologist and morphologist, was  appointed _aide-naturaliste-adjoint_ in charge of Mollusca, Crustacea,  Worms, and Zooephytes. He was afterwards associated with H. Milne Edwards  in works on annelid worms. December 26, 1827, Latreille asked to be  allowed to employ Boisduval as a _preparateur_; he became the author of  several works on injurious insects and Lepidoptera.          CHAPTER VI    POSITION IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE; OPINIONS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND  SOME LATER BIOLOGISTS      De Blainville, a worthy successor of Lamarck, in his posthumous book,  _Cuvier et Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire_, pays the highest tribute to his  predecessor, whose position as the leading naturalist of his time he  fully and gratefully acknowledges, saying: \"Among the men whose lectures  I have had the advantage of hearing, I truly recognize only three  masters, M. de Lamarck, M. Claude Richard, and M. Pinel\" (p. 43). He  also speaks of wishing to write the scientific biographies of Cuvier and  De Lamarck, the two zooelogists of this epoch whose lectures he most  frequently attended and whose writings he studied, and \"who have  exercised the greatest influence on the zooelogy of our time\" (p. 42).  Likewise in the opening words of the preface he refers to the rank taken  by Lamarck:      \"The aim which I have proposed to myself in my course on the    principles of zooelogy demonstrated by the history of its progress    from Aristotle to our time, and consequently the plan which I have    followed to attain this aim, have very naturally led me, so to    speak, in spite of myself, to signalize in M. de Lamarck the    expression of one of those phases through which the science of    organization has to pass in order to arrive at its last term before    showing its true aim. From my point of view this phase does not seem    to me to have been represented by any other naturalist of our time,    whatever may have been the reputation which he made during his    life.\"    He then refers to the estimation in which Lamarck was held by Auguste  Comte, who, in his _Cours de Philosophie Positive_, has anticipated and  even surpassed himself in the high esteem he felt for \"the celebrated  author of the _Philosophie Zoologique_.\"    The eulogy by Cuvier, which gives most fully the details of the early  life of Lamarck, and which has been the basis for all the subsequent  biographical sketches, was unworthy of him. Lamarck had, with his  customary self-abnegation and generosity, aided and favored the young  Cuvier in the beginning of his career,[50] who in his _Regne Animal_  adopted the classes founded by Lamarck. Thoroughly convinced of the  erroneous views of Cuvier in regard to cataclysms, he criticised and  opposed them in his writings in a courteous and proper way without  directly mentioning Cuvier by name or entering into any public debate  with him.    When the hour came for the great comparative anatomist and  palaeontologist, from his exalted position, to prepare a tribute to the  memory of a naturalist of equal merit and of a far more thoughtful and  profound spirit, to be read before the French Academy of Sciences, what  a eulogy it was--as De Blainville exclaims, _et quel eloge_! It was not  printed until after Cuvier's death, and then, it is stated, portions  were omitted as not suitable for publication.[51] This is, we believe,  the only stain on Cuvier's life, and it was unworthy of the great man.  In this _eloge_, so different in tone from the many others which are  collected in the three volumes of Cuvier's eulogies, he indiscriminately  ridicules all of Lamarck's theories. Whatever may have been his  condemnation of Lamarck's essays on physical and chemical subjects, he  might have been more reserved and less dogmatic and sarcastic in his  estimate of what he supposed to be the value of Lamarck's views on  evolution. It was Cuvier's adverse criticisms and ridicule and his  anti-evolutional views which, more than any other single cause, retarded  the progress of biological science and the adoption of a working theory  of evolution for which the world had to wait half a century.    It even appears that Lamarck was in part instrumental in inducing Cuvier  in 1795 to go to Paris from Normandy, and become connected with the  Museum. De Blainville relates that the Abbe Tessier met the young  zooelogist at Valmont near Fecamp, and wrote to Geoffroy that \"he had  just discovered in Normandy a pearl,\" and invited him to do what he  could to induce Cuvier to come to Paris. \"I made,\" said Geoffroy, \"the  proposition to my _confreres_, but I was supported, and only feebly, by  M. de Lamarck, who slightly knew M. Cuvier as the author of a memoir on  entomology.\"    The eulogy pronounced by Geoffroy St. Hilaire over the remains of his  old friend and colleague was generous, sympathetic, and heartfelt.      \"Yes [he said, in his eloquent way], for us who knew M. de Lamarck,    whom his counsels have guided, whom we have found always    indefatigable, devoted, occupied so willingly with the most    difficult labors, we shall not fear to say that such a loss leaves    in our ranks an immense void. From the blessings of such a life, so    rich in instructive lessons, so remarkable for the most generous    self-abnegation, it is difficult to choose.      \"A man of vigorous, profound ideas, and very often admirably    generalized, Lamarck conceived them with a view to the public good.    If he met, as often happened, with great opposition, he spoke of it    as a condition imposed on every one who begins a reform. Moreover,    the great age, the infirmities, but especially the grievous    blindness of M. de Lamarck had reserved for him another lot. This    great and strong mind could enjoy some consolation in knowing the    judgment of posterity, which for him began in his own lifetime. When    his last tedious days, useless to science, had arrived, when he had    ceased to be subjected to rivalry, envy and passion became    extinguished and justice alone remained. De Lamarck then heard    impartial voices, the anticipated echo of posterity, which would    judge him as history will judge him. Yes, the scientific world has    pronounced its judgment in giving him the name of 'the French    Linne,' thus linking together the two men who have both merited a    triple crown by their works on general natural history, zooelogy and    botany, and whose names, increasing in fame from age to age, will    both be handed down to the remotest posterity.\"[52]    Also in his _Etudes sur la Vie, les Ouvrages, et les Doctrines de  Buffon_ (1838), Geoffroy again, with much warmth of affection, says:      \"Attacked on all sides, injured likewise by odious ridicule,    Lamarck, too indignant to answer these cutting epigrams, submitted    to the indignity with a sorrowful patience.... Lamarck lived a long    while poor, blind, and forsaken, but not by me; I shall ever love    and venerate him.\"[53]    The following evidently heartfelt and sincere tribute to his memory,  showing warm esteem and thorough respect for Lamarck, and also a  confident feeling that his lasting fame was secure, is to be found in an  obscure little book[54] containing satirical, humorous, but perhaps not  always fair or just, characterizations and squibs concerning the  professors and aid-naturalists of the Jardin des Plantes.      \"What head will not be uncovered on hearing pronounced the name of    the man whose genius was ignored and who languished steeped in    bitterness. Blind, poor, forgotten, he remained alone with a glory    of whose extent he himself was conscious, but which only the coming    ages will sanction, when shall be revealed more clearly the laws of    organization.      \"Lamarck, thy abandonment, sad as it was in thy old age, is better "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#13)"],[1,"quickened and  fanned my cheek, and borne upon it came the faint and far-away bay of a  hound. It came again and again, each time nearer. Then on a stronger  puff of wind rang the clear, deep, mellow call that had given Sounder  his beautiful name. Never it seemed had I heard music so  blood-stirring. Sounder was on the trail of something, and he had it  headed my way. Satan heard, shot up his long ears, and tried to go  ahead; but I restrained and soothed him into quiet.    Long moments I sat there, with the poignant consciousness of the  wildness of the scene, of the significant rattling of the stones and of  the bell-tongued hound baying incessantly, sending warm joy through my  veins, the absorption in sensations new, yielding only to the hunting  instinct when Satan snorted and quivered. Again the deep-toned bay rang  into the silence with its stirring thrill of life. And a sharp rattling  of stones just above brought another snort from Satan.    Across an open space in the pinyons a gray form flashed. I leaped off  Satan and knelt to get a better view under the trees. I soon made out  another deer passing along the base of the cliff. Mounting again, I  rode up to the cliff to wait for Sounder.    A long time I had to wait for the hound. It proved that the atmosphere  was as deceiving in regard to sound as to sight. Finally Sounder came  running along the wall. I got off to intercept him. The crazy  fellow--he had never responded to my overtures of friendship--uttered  short, sharp yelps of delight, and actually leaped into my arms. But I  could not hold him. He darted upon the trail again and paid no heed to  my angry shouts. With a resolve to overhaul him, I jumped on Satan and  whirled after the hound.    The black stretched out with such a stride that I was at pains to keep  my seat. I dodged the jutting rocks and projecting snags; felt stinging  branches in my face and the rush of sweet, dry wind. Under the  crumbling walls, over slopes of weathered stone and droppings of  shelving rock, round protruding noses of cliff, over and under pinyons  Satan thundered. He came out on the top of the ridge, at the narrow  back I had called a saddle. Here I caught a glimpse of Sounder far  below, going down into the ravine from which I had ascended some time  before. I called to him, but I might as well have called to the wind.    Weary to the point of exhaustion, I once more turned Satan toward camp.  I lay forward on his neck and let him have his will. Far down the  ravine I awoke to strange sounds, and soon recognized the cracking of  iron-shod hoofs against stone; then voices. Turning an abrupt bend in  the sandy wash, I ran into Jones and Wallace.    \"Fall in! Line up in the sad procession!\" said Jones. \"Tige and the pup  are faithful. The rest of the dogs are somewhere between the Grand  Canyon and the Utah desert.\"    I related my adventures, and tried to spare Moze and Sounder as much as  conscience would permit.    \"Hard luck!\" commented Jones. \"Just as the hounds jumped the  cougar--Oh! they bounced him out of the rocks all right--don't you  remember, just under that cliff wall where you and Wallace came up to  me? Well, just as they jumped him, they ran right into fresh deer  tracks. I saw one of the deer. Now that's too much for any hounds,  except those trained for lions. I shot at Moze twice, but couldn't turn  him. He has to be hurt, they've all got to be hurt to make them  understand.\"    Wallace told of a wild ride somewhere in Jones's wake, and of sundry  knocks and bruises he had sustained, of pieces of corduroy he had left  decorating the cedars and of a most humiliating event, where a gaunt  and bare pinyon snag had penetrated under his belt and lifted him, mad  and kicking, off his horse.    \"These Western nags will hang you on a line every chance they get,\"  declared Jones, \"and don't you overlook that. Well, there's the cabin.  We'd better stay here a few days or a week and break in the dogs and  horses, for this day's work was apple pie to what we'll get in the  Siwash.\"    I groaned inwardly, and was remorselessly glad to see Wallace fall off  his horse and walk on one leg to the cabin. When I got my saddle off  Satan, had given him a drink and hobbled him, I crept into the cabin  and dropped like a log. I felt as if every bone in my body was broken  and my flesh was raw. I got gleeful gratification from Wallace's  complaints, and Jones's remark that he had a stitch in his back. So  ended the first chase after cougars.        CHAPTER 5.    OAK SPRING    Moze and Don and Sounder straggled into camp next morning, hungry,  footsore and scarred; and as they limped in, Jones met them with  characteristic speech: \"Well, you decided to come in when you got  hungry and tired? Never thought of how you fooled me, did you? Now, the  first thing you get is a good licking.\"    He tied them in a little log pen near the cabin and whipped them  soundly. And the next few days, while Wallace and I rested, he took  them out separately and deliberately ran them over coyote and deer  trails. Sometimes we heard his stentorian yell as a forerunner to the  blast from his old shotgun. Then again we heard the shots unheralded by  the yell. Wallace and I waxed warm under the collar over this peculiar  method of training dogs, and each of us made dire threats. But in  justice to their implacable trainer, the dogs never appeared to be  hurt; never a spot of blood flecked their glossy coats, nor did they  ever come home limping. Sounder grew wise, and Don gave up, but Moze  appeared not to change.    \"All hands ready to rustle,\" sang out Frank one morning. \"Old Baldy's  got to be shod.\"    This brought us all, except Jones, out of the cabin, to see the object  of Frank's anxiety tied to a nearby oak. At first I failed to recognize  Old Baldy. Vanished was the slow, sleepy, apathetic manner that had  characterized him; his ears lay back on his head; fire flashed from his  eyes. When Frank threw down a kit-bag, which emitted a metallic  clanking, Old Baldy sat back on his haunches, planted his forefeet deep  in the ground and plainly as a horse could speak, said \"No!\"    \"Sometimes he's bad, and sometimes worse,\" growled Frank.    \"Shore he's plumb bad this mornin',\" replied Jim.    Frank got the three of us to hold Baldy's head and pull him up, then he  ventured to lift a hind foot over his line. Old Baldy straightened out  his leg and sent Frank sprawling into the dirt. Twice again Frank  patiently tried to hold a hind leg, with the same result; and then he  lifted a forefoot. Baldy uttered a very intelligible snort, bit through  Wallace's glove, yanked Jim off his feet, and scared me so that I let  go his forelock. Then he broke the rope which held him to the tree.  There was a plunge, a scattering of men, though Jim still valiantly  held on to Baldy's head, and a thrashing of scrub pinyon, where Baldy  reached out vigorously with his hind feet. But for Jim, he would have  escaped.    \"What's all the row?\" called Jones from the cabin. Then from the door,  taking in the situation, he yelled: \"Hold on, Jim! Pull down on the  ornery old cayuse!\"    He leaped into action with a lasso in each hand, one whirling round his  head. The slender rope straightened with a whiz and whipped round  Baldy's legs as he kicked viciously. Jones pulled it tight, then  fastened it with nimble fingers to the tree.    \"Let go! let go! Jim!\" he yelled, whirling the other lasso. The loop  flashed and fell over Baldy's head and tightened round his neck. Jones  threw all the weight of his burly form on the lariat, and Baldy crashed  to the ground, rolled, tussled, screamed, and then lay on his back,  kicking the air with three free legs. \"Hold this,\" ordered Jones,  giving the tight rope to Frank. Whereupon he grabbed my lasso from the  saddle, roped Baldy's two forefeet, and pulled him down on his side.  This lasso he fastened to a scrub cedar.    \"He's chokin'!\" said Frank.    \"Likely he is,\" replied Jones shortly. \"It'll do him good.\" But with  his big hands he drew the coil loose and slipped it down over Baldy's  nose, where he tightened it again.    \"Now, go ahead,\" he said, taking the rope from Frank.    It had all been done in a twinkling. Baldy lay there groaning and  helpless, and when Frank once again took hold of the wicked leg, he was  almost passive. When the shoeing operation had been neatly and quickly  attended to and Baldy released from his uncomfortable position he  struggled to his feet with heavy breaths, shook himself, and looked at  his master.    \"How'd you like being hog-tied?\" queried his conqueror, rubbing Baldy's  nose. \"Now, after this you'll have some manners.\"    Old Baldy seemed to understand, for he looked sheepish, and lapsed once  more into his listless, lazy unconcern.    \"Where's Jim's old cayuse, the pack-horse?\" asked our leader.    \"Lost. Couldn't find him this morning, an' had a deuce of a time  findin' the rest of the bunch. Old Baldy was cute. He hid in a bunch of  pinyons an' stood quiet so his bell wouldn't ring. I had to trail him.\"    \"Do the horses stray far when they are hobbled?\" inquired Wallace.    \"If they keep jumpin' all night they can cover some territory. We're  now on the edge of the wild horse country, and our nags know this as  well as we. They smell the mustangs, an' would break their necks to get  away. Satan and the sorrel were ten miles from camp when I found them  this mornin'. An' Jim's cayuse went farther, an' we never will get him.  He'll wear his hobbles out, then away with the wild horses. Once with  them, he'll never be caught again.\"    On the sixth day of our stay at Oak we had visitors, whom Frank  introduced as the Stewart brothers and Lawson, wild-horse wranglers.  They were still, dark men, whose facial expression seldom varied; tall  and lithe and wiry as the mustangs they rode. The Stewarts were on  their way to Kanab, Utah, to arrange for the sale of a"]]]
