[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#13)"],[1,"later, April, 1699, we have another entry, to the effect that Lord  Spencer purchased 'an incomparable library,' until now the property of  'a very fine scholar, whom from a child I have known,' whose name does  not transpire [? Hadrian Beverland], but in whose library were many  'rare books . . . that were printed at the first invention of that  wonderful art.' In reference to Macky's incidental allusion to the Earl  of Sunderland's indifference to cost in forming his library, Wanley  confirms this. Writing in December, 1721, the diarist observes that the  books in Mr. Freebairn's library 'in general went low, or rather at vile  rates, through a combination of the booksellers against the sale. Yet  some books went for unaccountably high prices, which were bought by Mr.  Vaillant, the bookseller, who had an unlimited commission from the Earl  of Sunderland.' Among the items was an edition of Virgil, printed by  Zarothus _circa_ 1475: 'It was noted that when Mr. Vaillant had bought  the printed Virgil at L46, he huzza'd out aloud, and threw up his hat,  for joy that he had bought it so cheap.' When this famous book-collector  died, Wanley observes that 'by reason of his decease some benefit may  accrue to this library [Lord Oxford's], even in case his relations will  part with none of his books. I mean, _by his raising the price of books  no higher now_; so that, in probability, this commodity may fall in the  market; and any gentleman be permitted to buy an uncommon old book for  less than forty or fifty pounds.' The third son of this famous  book-collector, Charles, fifth Earl of Sunderland, and second Duke of  Marlborough, greatly enlarged the collection formed by his father; and  it was removed to Blenheim probably in 1734. This famous library  remained practically intact until it came under the hammer at Puttick  and Simpson's, occupying fifty-one days in the dispersal at intervals  from December 1, 1881, to March 22, 1883, the total being L55,581 6s. It  is stated that the library originally cost about L30,000.    Dr. David Williams, who from 1688 to the end of his life was minister  of a Presbyterian congregation which met at Hand Alley, Bishopsgate  Street, was a contemporary book-collector and book-hunter. His special  line was theology, and his library, which absorbed that of Dr. Bates,  once Rector of St. Dunstan's-in-the-East, is still preserved intact, and  is now, to a certain degree, a free library. Archbishop Tenison was  another great book-hunter of this period, and his library was preserved  more or less intact until 1861, when it was dispersed at Sotheby's,  under an order of the Charity Commissioners.    The brothers Thomas and Richard Rawlinson were, probably, the most  omnivorous collectors of the earlier part of the last century.  Everything in the shape of a book was welcomed. The former (1681-1725),  whose 'C. & P.' (collated and perfect) appears on the frontispiece,  title-page, or fly-leaf of books, when he lived in Gray's Inn, had so  filled his set of four rooms with books that he was obliged to sleep in  the passage. He is said to be the original study for the 158th _Tatler_,  in which 'Tom Folio' and other _soi-disant_ scholars are trounced. 'He  has a greater esteem for Aldus and Elzevir than for Virgil and Horace.'  It is very doubtful whether Addison (who wrote this particular _Tatler_)  really had Thomas Rawlinson in mind, whom he describes as 'a learned  idiot.' Swift has declared that some know books as they do lords; learn  their titles exactly, and then brag of their acquaintance. But neither  description is applicable to Rawlinson, who, for all that, may have  known much more about Aldus or the Elzevirs than about Virgil or Horace.  With a pretty taste for epithets, in which our forefathers sometimes  indulged, Hearne has defended his friend from Addison's sarcasms by  declaring that the mistake could only have been made by a 'shallow  buffoon.' That Rawlinson was a bibliomaniac there can be no question,  for if he had a score copies of one book, he would purchase another for  the mere gratification of possessing it. When he removed to the large  mansion in Aldersgate Street, which had been the palace of the Bishops  of London, and which he shared with his brother, 'the books still  continued to be better lodged than their owner.' He died, at the  comparatively early age of forty-four, as he had lived, among dust and  cobwebs, 'in his bundles, piles and bulwarks of paper.' The catalogue of  his huge mass of books was divided into nine parts; the sale of the MSS.  alone occupied sixteen days. Richard Rawlinson (died 1755) survived his  brother thirty years, and continued to collect books with all his  brother's enthusiasm, but without his sheer book-greed. His MSS. are at  Oxford, and the extent and richness of his accumulations may be gathered  from the fact that the collector laid nearly thirty libraries under  contribution. His printed books were sold in 1756 by Samuel Baker (now  Sotheby's), the sale occupying forty-nine days, and the total amounting  to L1,155 1s.; a second sale included 20,000 pamphlets, and a third sale  consisted of prints.    [Illustration: _London House, Aldersgate Street, 1808._]    Among the wisest and most distinguished book-collectors of the first  half of the last century is Dr. Richard Mead (1673-1754), a physician by  profession, but a bibliophile by instinct, and whom Dr. Johnson  described as having 'lived more in the broad sunshine of life than  almost any other man.' As Dr. Mead's fine library was 'picked up at  Rome,' it scarcely comes within our purview; but it may be mentioned  that so long as this fine collection remained intact in London, it was  _ipso facto_ a free library; it was especially rich in the classics,  sciences and history. The first part was sold by Samuel Baker in 1754,  and the second in the following year, the 6,592 lots occupying  fifty-seven days, the total of the books being L5,496 15s. Dr. Mead's  mantle descended to his great friend and pupil, Dr. Anthony Askew  (1722-1774), who had an exceedingly fine library; his career as a  collector began in Paris in 1749, and nearly all his choicest treasures  appear to have been gathered on the Continent, and chiefly it seems by  Joseph Smith, the English Consul at Venice. Askew's first library was  purchased by George III. in 1762, and now forms an integral part of the  British Museum. His subsequent accumulations were dispersed in two  sections, the books in 1775, and the MSS. ten years later. We shall have  occasion to refer again to the Askew sale. Dr. Richard Farmer appears to  have imbibed his taste for book-collecting from Askew, and became an  indefatigable haunter of the London and country bookstalls, his special  line being Early English literature, then scarcely at all appreciated;  it is stated that the collection, which cost him less than L500,  realized, when sold by auction by King in 1798, upwards of L2,000. Dr.  Farmer is better remembered by posterity as a Shakespearian critic or  commentator. He was a Canon Residentiary of St. Paul's, and appears to  have had what Dibdin describes as 'his foragers, his jackalls, and his  _avant-couriers_,' who picked up for him every item of interest in his  particular lines. As becomes the true bibliophile, he was peculiarly  indifferent to his dress, but he was a scholar of great abilities. A  glance at a priced copy of his sale catalogue is enough to turn any  book-lover green with envy. For example, his copy of Richard Barnfield's  'Encomion of Lady Pecunia, or the Praise of Money' (1598), sold for  19s., Malone being the purchaser. That copy is now in the Bodleian. In  1882, the Ouvry copy of the same book realized 100 guineas! A copy of  Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (1667), with the first title-page, sold for  11s.; a volume of twelve poems, chiefly printed by Wynkyn de Worde and  Pynson, realized 25 guineas. Each item would probably realize the  amount paid for the whole, should they again occur for sale, which is  most unlikely. Both his friends, George Steevens and Isaac Reed, were  equally zealous collectors, and each had a strong weakness for the same  groove of collecting. The library of Steevens was sold, also by King, in  1800, and the 1,943 items realized L2,740 15s.; whilst that of Reed,  sold seven years later, contained 8,957 articles, and realized L4,387.    Both Steevens and Isaac Reed call for a much more extended notice than  it is possible to give them here. Many of Steevens' books realized  twenty times the amount which he paid for them. Steevens, who was born  in 1736, resided in a retired house 'just on the rise of Hampstead  Heath,' so Dibdin tells us, the house being formerly known as the Upper  Flask Tavern, to which 'Richardson sends Clarissa in one of her escapes  from Lovelace.' Here, as Dibdin further tells us, Steevens lived,  embosomed in books, shrubs, and trees. 'His habits were indeed peculiar;  not much to be envied or imitated, as they sometimes betrayed the  flights of a madman, and sometimes the asperities of the cynic. His  attachments were warm, but fickle, both in choice and duration.' Several  of his letters are printed in Dibdin's 'Bibliomania' (edit. 1842), in  which will also be found a long series of extracts from the sale  catalogue of his library. There were nearly fifty copies of the first or  early quartos of the Shakespearian plays, which were knocked down at  prices varying from 5s. to, in a few instances, over L20. The first,  second, third and fourth folios realized L22, L18 18s., L8 8s., and L2  12s. 6d., respectively! Isaac Reed was in many ways a remarkable man. He  was the son of a baker in the parish of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West. Born  in 1742, he commenced professional life as a solicitor, which he soon  abandoned for the more congenial pursuit of literature. His knowledge of  English literature was unbounded, and the dispersal of his remarkable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#13)"],[1,"cords, which thus project a little from the back, and  form the \"bands,\" seen in raised form on the backs of some books. Books  should be sewed on three to six cords, according to their size. This  raised-band sewing is reckoned by some a feature of excellent binding.  The sunken-band style is apt to give a stiff back, while the raised bands  are usually treated with a flexible back. When sewed, the book is  detached from its fellows, which may have been sewed on the same bench,  by slipping it along the cords, then cutting them apart, so as to leave  some two inches of each cord projecting, as ends to be fastened later to  the board. In careful binding, the thread is sewed \"all along,\" _i. e._:  each sheet by itself, instead of \"two on,\" as it is called.    The next process is termed \"lining up,\" and consists of putting on the  proper fly-leaves or end-leaves, at the beginning and end of the volume.  These usually consist of four leaves of ordinary white printing paper at  each end, sometimes finished out with two leaves of colored or marbled  paper, to add a touch of beauty to the book when opened. Marbled paper is  more durable in color than the tinted, and does not stain so easily. One  of these end-leaves is pasted down to the inside cover, while the other  is left flying--whence \"fly-leaf.\"    After this comes the cutting of the book at the edges. This is done by  screwing it firmly in a cutting-machine, which works a sharp knife  rapidly, shaving off the edges successively of the head, front and end,  or \"tail\" as it is called in book-binding parlance. This trimming used to  be done by hand, with a sharp cutting knife called by binders a \"plough.\"  Now, there are many forms of cutting machines, some of which are called  \"guillotines\" for an obvious reason. In binding some books, which it is  desired to preserve with wide margins, only a mere shaving is taken off  the head, so as to leave it smooth at the top, letting the front and tail  leaves remain uncut. But in case of re-binding much-used books, the edges  are commonly so much soiled that trimming all around may be required, in  order that they may present a decent appearance. Yet in no case should  the binder be allowed to cut any book deeply, so as to destroy a good,  fair margin. Care must also be taken to cut the margins evenly, at right  angles, avoiding any crooked lines.    After cutting the book comes \"rounding,\" or giving the back of the book a  curved instead of its flat shape. This process is done with the hand, by  a hammer, or in a rounding press, with a metallic roller. Before  rounding, the back of the book is glued up, that is, receives a coating  of melted glue with a glueing brush, to hold the sections together, and  render the back firm, and a thorough rubbing of the back with hot glue  between the sections gives strength to the volume.    Next comes the treatment of the edges of the book, hitherto all white, in  order to protect them from showing soil in long use. Sometimes (and this  is the cheaper process) the books are simply sprinkled at the edges with  a brush dipped in a dark fluid made of burnt umber or red ochre, and  shaken with a quick concussion near the edges until they receive a  sprinkle of color from the brush. Other books receive what is called a  solid color on the edges, the books being screwed into a press, and the  color applied with a sponge or brush.    But a marbled edge presents a far more handsome appearance, and should  harmonize in color and figure with the marbled paper of the end leaves.  Marbling, so called from its imitation of richly veined colored marble,  is staining paper or book edges with variegated colors. The process of  marbling is highly curious, both chemically and aesthetically, and may be  briefly described. A large shallow trough or vat is filled with prepared  gum water (gum-tragacanth being used); on the surface of this gum-water  bright colors, mixed with a little ox-gall, to be used in producing the  composite effect aimed at in the marbling are thrown or sprinkled in  liquid form. Then they are deftly stirred or agitated on the surface of  the water, with an implement shaped to produce a certain pattern. The  most commonly used one is a long metallic comb, which is drawn across the  surface of the combined liquids, leaving its pattern impressed upon the  ductile fluid. The edges of the book to be marbled are then touched or  dipped on the top of the water, on which the coloring matter floats, and  at once withdrawn, exhibiting on the edge the precise pattern of \"combed  marble\" desired, since the various colors--red, yellow, blue, white,  etc., have adhered to the surface of the book-edges. The serrated and  diversified effect of most comb-marbling is due to stroking the comb in  waved lines over the surface. The spotted effect so much admired in other  forms, is produced by throwing the colors on with a brush, at the fancy  of the skilled workman, or artist, as you may call him. Marbled paper is  made in the same way, by dipping one surface of the white sheet, held in  a curved form, with great care on the surface of the coloring vat. This  is termed shell and wave marbling, as distinguished from comb-marbling.  The paper or the book edges are next finished by sizing and burnishing,  which gives them a bright glistening appearance.    A still more ornate effect in a book is attained by gilding the edges.  Frequently the head of a book is gilt, leaving the front and tail of an  uncut book without ornament, and this is esteemed a very elegant style by  book connoisseurs, who are, or should be solicitous of wide margins. The  gilding of the top edge is a partial protection from dust falling inside,  to which the other edges are not so liable. To gild a book edge, it is  placed in a press, the edges scraped or smoothed, and coated with a  red-colored fluid, which serves to heighten the effect of the gold. Then  a sizing is applied by a camel's-hair brush, being a sticky substance,  usually the white of an egg, mixed with water (termed by binders  \"glaire\") and the gold-leaf is laid smoothly over it. When the sizing is  dry, the gold is burnished with a tool, tipped with an agate or  blood-stone, drawn forcibly over the edge until it assumes a glistening  appearance.    After the edges have been treated by whatever process, there follows what  is termed the \"backing\" of the book. The volume is pressed between iron  clamps, and the back is hammered or rolled where it joins the sides, so  as to form a groove to hold the boards forming the solid portion of the  cover of every book. A backing-machine is sometimes used for this  process, making by pressure the joint or groove for the boards. Then the  \"head-band\" is glued on, being a silk braid or colored muslin, fastened  around a cord, which projects a little above the head and the tail, at  the back of the book, giving it a more finished appearance. At the same  time, a book-mark for keeping the place is sometimes inserted and  fastened like the head-band. This is often a narrow ribbon of colored  silk, or satin, and helps to give a finish to the book, as well as to  furnish the reader a trustworthy guide to keep a place--as it will not  fall out like bits of paper inserted for that purpose.    Next, the mill-boards are applied, cut so as to project about an eighth  to a quarter of an inch from the edges of the book on three sides. The  book is held to the boards by the ends of its cords being interlaced, _i.  e._: passed twice through holes pierced in the boards, the loose ends of  the cords being then wet with paste and hammered down flat to the surface  of the boards. The best tar-boards should be used, which are made of old  rope; no board made of straw is fit to be used on any book. Straw boards  are an abomination--a cheap expedient which costs dearly in the end. The  binder should use heavy boards on the larger and thicker volumes, but  thin ones on all duodecimos and smaller sizes.    Next, the books are subjected to a second pressing, after which the  lining of the back is in order. Good thick brown paper is generally used  for this, cut to the length of the book, and is firmly glued to the back,  and rubbed down closely with a bone folder. A cloth \"joint,\" or piece of  linen (termed \"muslin super,\") is often glued to the back, with two  narrow flaps to be pasted to the boards, on each side, thus giving  greater tenacity to the covering. If the book is to be backed so as to  open freely, that is, to have a spring back or elastic back, two  thicknesses of a firm, strong paper, or thin card-board are used, one  thickness of the paper being glued to the back of the book, while the  other--open in the middle, but fastened at the edges, is to be glued to  the leather of which the back is to be made.    After this, comes putting the book in leather. If full bound a piece of  leather cut full size of the volume, with about half an inch over, is  firmly glued or pasted to the boards and the back, the leather being  turned over the edges of the boards, and nicely glued on their inside  margin. It is of great importance that the edges of the leather should be  smoothly pared down with a sharp knife, so as to present an even edge  where the leather joins the boards, not a protuberance--which makes an  ugly and clumsy piece of work, instead of a neat one.    For half-binding, a piece of leather is taken large enough to cover the  back lengthwise, and turn in at the head and tail, while the width should  be such as to allow from one to one and a half inches of the leather to  be firmly glued to the boards next the back. The four corners of the  boards are next to be leathered, the edges of the leather being carefully  pared down, to give a smooth surface, even with the boards, when turned  in. The leather is usually wet, preparatory to being manipulated thus,  which renders it more flexible and ductile than in its dry state. The  cloth"]]]
