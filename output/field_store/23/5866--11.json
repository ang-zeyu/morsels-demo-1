[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#13)"],[1,"heresies. He flies in the face of the  Athanasian Creed by representing the generation of the Son as an event  occurring in time--\"on such day as Heaven's great year brings forth.\" His  later poem of _Paradise Regained_ and the posthumous treatise of  Christian Doctrine show him an Arian; in the poem the Almighty is made to  speak of      This perfect man, by merit called my Son.    His account of the creation of the World as a mere ordering or  re-arrangement of the wild welter of an uncreated material Chaos receives  no countenance from the Fathers. In many points of theological teaching  he is compelled to form definite and even visual conceptions where  orthodoxy had cautiously confined itself to vague general propositions.  So that the description of Sin and Death and of the causeway built by  them between Hell-gates and the World, much as it has been objected to  even by admirers of the poem, is only an extreme instance of the defining  and hardening process that Milton found needful throughout for the  concrete presentment of the high doings which are his theme. He congealed  the mysteries of Time and Space, Love and Death, Sin and Forgiveness,  into a material system; and in so doing, while paying the utmost  deference to his authorities, he yet exercised many a choice with regard  to matters indifferent or undefinable. Thus, for instance, he borrows  from the Talmud the notion that Satan first learned the existence of a  prohibited tree from overhearing a conversation between Adam and Eve. He  was surely conscious of what he was doing, and would have been not  ill-pleased to learn that the Universe, as he conceived of it, has since  been called by his name. It is Milton's Paradise Lost, lost by Milton's  Adam and Eve, who are tempted by Milton's Satan, and punished by Milton's  God. The stamp of his clear hard imagination is on the whole fabric; and  it is not much harder for us to coax ourselves into the belief that his  is indeed the very world we inhabit than it was for the men of his own  time. The senses and the intellect are older than modern science, and  were employed to good effect before the invention of the spectroscope; it  is they in their daily operation that make it difficult to leap the gulf  which separates the amenities and trivialities of common life from the  solemn theatre of the poet's imagination. The objection that the poem has  lost much of its value because we are compelled to imagine where our  elders believed is of little weight in a case like this, where our lack  of belief is not brought home to us until insuperable difficulties are  placed in the way of our imagination. Where Milton was freest, there we  follow him most gladly; where he wrote in fetters, as notably in some of  the scenes transacted in Heaven, our imagination, not our belief, is the  first to rebel.    We are deceived by names; the more closely _Paradise Lost_ is studied,  the more does the hand of the author appear in every part. The epic poem,  which in its natural form is a kind of cathedral for the ideas of a  nation, is by him transformed into a chapel-of-ease for his own mind, a  monument to his own genius and his own habits of thought. The _Paradise  Lost_ is like the sculptured tombs of the Medici in Florence; it is not  of Night and Morning, nor of Lorenzo and Giuliano, that we think as we  look at them, but solely of the great creator, Michael Angelo. The same  dull convention that calls the _Paradise Lost_ a religious poem might  call these Christian statues. Each is primarily a great work of art in  each the traditions of two eras are blended in a unity that is indicative  of nothing but the character and powers of the artist. The _Paradise  Lost_ is not the less an eternal monument because it is a monument to  dead ideas.    We do not know exactly when Milton made his choice of subject. His Latin  verses addressed to Manso, Marquis of Villa, in January 1638-9, show that  Arthur and the Round Table was at that time the uppermost theme in his  mind, and that the warlike achievement of heroes was the aspect of it  that most attracted him. After his return to England in 1639, it is  mentioned once again in his elegy on Charles Diodati, and then we hear no  more of it. In the tentative list of subjects, made in 1641, Arthur has  disappeared, and the story of _Paradise Lost_ already occupies the most  conspicuous place, with four separate drafts suggesting different  treatments of the theme.    It would be idle to speculate on what Milton might have made of the  Arthur legends. One thing is certain; he would have set up the warrior  king as a perfectly objective figure, hampered by no allegory, and with  no inward and spiritual signification. The national cause, maintained  heroically in a hundred battles, and overwhelmed at last by the brute  violence of the foreign oppressor, was subject enough for him; he would  never have marred his epic by sickly irresolution and the struggles of a  divided will in the principal characters. Perhaps his mind reverted to  his old dreams when he came to describe the pastimes wherewith the rebel  angels beguile their time in Hell:--                      Others, more mild,    Retreated in a silent valley, sing    With notes angelical to many a harp    Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall    By doom of battle, and complain that Fate    Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.    Their song was partial; but the harmony    (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)    Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment    The thronging audience.    This is only one of the very numerous places in _Paradise Lost_ where,  before he is well aware of it, we catch Milton's sympathies dilating  themselves upon the wrong side.    His researches in British annals, begun at the time when he was still in  quest of a theme, convinced him that the whole story of Arthur was  \"obscured and blemished with fables.\" He foraged among other British  subjects, feeling that the great poem which was designed to raise England  to the literary peerage and set her by the side of countries of older  fame must deal with a theme of truly national import. Some of the  subjects that he jotted down were obviously of too incidental and trivial  a nature for his purpose, and a wise instinct confined him to the earlier  history of the island, where his own freedom of treatment was less likely  to be hampered by an excess of detail. And then, precisely how or when we  do not know, the idea came to him that he would treat a subject still  larger and of a more tremendous import,--the fortunes, not of the nation,  but of the race:--      With loss of Eden, till one greater Man    Restore us, and regain the blissful seat.    The attractions that this theme, once hit on, exercised on Milton's mind  may easily be guessed. In the first place, it was a sacred subject: an  opportunity for leading poetry back to its divine allegiance; and, by the  creation of a new species of epic, an escape from a danger which must  have been very present to his mind--the danger of too close an imitation  of the ancients. More specific reasons concurred in recommending it. In  the Garden of Eden he might present to an age which was overrun with a  corrupt religion and governed by a decadent court the picture of a  religion without a church, of life in its primitive simplicity, and of  patriarchal worship without the noisome accretions of later ceremonial.  His attitude to the Laudian movement is eloquently expressed, at this  same time, in the treatise _Of Reformation in England_, where he  describes how the religious teachers of his own and preceding ages \"began  to draw down all the divine intercourse betwixt God and the soul, yea,  the very shape of God himself into an exterior and bodily form, urgently  pretending a necessity and obligement of joining the body in a formal  reverence and worship circumscribed; they hallowed it, they fumed it,  they sprinkled it, they bedecked it, not in robes of pure innocency, but  of pure linen, with other deformed and fantastic dresses, in palls and  mitres, gold, and gewgaws fetched from Aaron's old wardrobe or the  flamen's vestry: then was the priest set to con his motions and his  postures, his liturgies and his lurries, till the soul by this means of  over-bodying herself, given up justly to fleshly delights, bated her wing  apace downward: and finding the ease she had from her visible and  sensuous colleague, the body, in performance of religious duties, her  pinions now broken and flagging, shifted off from herself the labour of  high soaring any more, forgot her heavenly flight, and left the dull and  droiling carcase to plod on in the old road and drudging trade of outward  conformity.\"    But Adam and Eve, Milton is careful to explain, were not ritualists. They  recite their evening hymn of praise as they stand at the entrance to  their shady lodge:--      This said unanimous, and other rites    Observing none, but adoration pure    Which God likes best, into their inmost bower    Handed they went.    The traits of Milton's Puritanism peep out at unexpected places in the  poem. The happy Garden, Adam is told, will be destroyed after the Flood,  for a reason that would have been approved by the image-breakers of the  Commonwealth:--      To teach thee that God attributes to place    No sanctity, if none be thither brought    By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.    The palace of Pandemonium is built by Satan's host in an hour, whence men  may      Learn how their greatest monuments of fame,    And strength, and art, are easily outdone    By spirits reprobate;    --a perfectly sound moral, well illustrating Mr. Swinburne's remark that  Puritanism has nothing to do with Art, and that the great Puritans and  the great artists have never confused them.    Milton must also have been drawn to the theme of _Paradise Lost_ by the  scope it promised for scenes of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#13)"],[1,"you give them?\"    \"I don't possess more than sixpence. I'm bankrupt, and in debt to you,  too.\"    \"But you're sure to get something at Christmas, aren't you?\"    \"I expect so.\"    \"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll lend you another ten  shillings. That will make a sovereign altogether, and you can pay me  back when you've had your Christmas presents.\"    \"Oh, Netta, how good of you!\"    \"Not so particularly. It's only a loan, and I expect you to give it  back.\"    \"Of course.\"    \"You'd better go to Parker's this afternoon at four.\"    \"I daren't!\" said Gwen, who felt that she was floundering deeper and  deeper into a morass of trouble. \"You don't know what a scrape I got  into at home for stopping behind that other time. Beatrice made me  promise absolutely always to come home with Winnie and Lesbia. I  should have to give all kinds of explanations.\"    \"I'm supposed to go straight home too, on these dark afternoons. My  mother's rather particular about it.\"    \"Then what's to be done?\"    \"You'll have to make a bolt in the dinner hour. There's nothing else  for it.\"    \"Umph! It's risky.\"    \"You must risk something, O my cautious philosopher! Nobody but  Thistles is about just then, and I think we can outwit Thistles. I'll  bring the half-sovereign to school with me to-morrow, and you can take  it to Parker's, in case it's wanted. I'm afraid you'll find you'll  need it.\"    \"I should like to prosecute Emma--she richly deserves it!\"    \"Couldn't do that without giving ourselves away, so you'll have to  restrain your righteous wrath, my child!\"    Gwen spent the rest of the day feeling as if a black shadow had  suddenly fallen over her life. She had believed the episode of the  china was completely finished with, and here it had cropped up again  like some horrible bogey prepared to haunt her. It was worse than  ever, for she had lost her own fifteen shillings as well as the ten  which Netta had previously lent her. Between Parker's and Netta she  now owed thirty-two and sixpence. The largeness of the debt appalled  her. How was she ever to refund it? She hoped she might get a little  money at Christmas. Her grandmother and Aunt Violet generally sent  postal orders for presents, telling the girls to buy what they liked;  it was these welcome gifts that constituted most of her contributions  to her savings box.    The hint which Parker's had given about sending the account to her  father frightened her greatly. Father must not know. He would have  quite enough Christmas bills to pay without adding an extra one.  Besides, what would he think of her? Gwen liked to stand high in her  father's estimation. Beatrice, too, would hear of it, and would not  spare her.    \"I'm always the black sheep of the family,\" thought Gwen. \"None of  them have ever done anything so dreadful as this. No! I simply  shouldn't dare to tell at home.\"    Netta turned up next morning with the half-sovereign, according to her  promise. She was not an ungenerous girl, and she had plenty of pocket  money, for her father was well off, and liberal to his only daughter.  She was willing to help Gwen out of a difficulty for which she knew  she herself was partly responsible, and perhaps also she rather  appreciated the sense of power that the debt gave her over her  schoolfellow. Netta dearly loved to lead: she would have liked to be  of importance in the Form, and was often annoyed that Hilda Browne,  Iris Watson, and some of the others looked down upon her. It was  pleasant therefore to feel that she had one satellite who was bound to  revolve in her orbit, and could be reckoned upon to support her on all  occasions.    Gwen had decided to commit a breach of school rules, and to rush out  between dinner and afternoon school to pay her visit to the china  shop. As she had said, it was a risky performance. If she were caught,  she would be reported to Miss Roscoe, and the penalty would be severe.  It seemed sailing 'twixt Scylla and Charybdis, but it was worth  trying. The first difficulty was how to put on her outdoor things  without anybody noticing. Girls kept strolling in and out of the  dressing-room in the most tiresome manner and after waiting as long as  she dared for the room to be empty, she was finally obliged to smuggle  her hat and coat into the passage, and garb herself there.    \"I've barely time,\" she said to Netta, who was acting scout. \"For  goodness sake tell me if you see Thistles about! Is the coast clear?  Then I'll scoot.\"    At the end of the passage, however, she encountered danger. Winnie was  standing by the gymnasium door, and Gwen only just drew back in time  to avoid her. Chafing with impatience, she waited while Winnie  leisurely examined some papers on the notice board. Was she going to  stay there all the afternoon? At last she moved, and went inside the  gymnasium, and Gwen plucked up courage to make a dash for the street  door. She hurried along with such enormous strides that passers-by  turned to look at her and smiled, but careless of the notice she was  attracting, she even broke into a run as she caught sight of the  Market Hall clock. She was panting and altogether out of breath by the  time she reached the china shop, and not at all sure what she ought to  say. She marched up to the counter, and produced the bill which she  had received.    \"Look here! You've sent me this,\" she began, \"and I want to know  whether it was really paid or not.\"    \"I'll just enquire, miss,\" said the assistant, referring to his  superior; then returning, after a whispered colloquy, he continued:  \"No, miss. Mr. Evans says it certainly never has been paid. You've no  receipt for it?\"    \"I gave the money to the housemaid at school, and told her to take  it,\" faltered Gwen.    \"Have you asked her about it, miss?\"    \"She's left, and I don't know where she's gone.\"    The assistant shook his head.    \"I'm afraid, in that case, she won't want to be found, though perhaps  the police could trace her if you cared to prosecute.\"    \"Would it not be simpler if we sent the account to your father,  missy?\" suggested the shopwalker, coming to join the assistant at the  counter. \"Ah! I forget whether we have your home address? Always best  to refer bills to one's father, isn't it? Then there's no trouble.\"    His tone verged on the familiar and impertinent. Gwen drew herself up  very straight.    \"I prefer to manage it myself, thank you,\" she replied icily. \"If you  will take ten shillings on account now, I will pay you the balance  after Christmas. Will you let it remain till then?\"    \"I dare say Mr. Parker wouldn't object--that's to say, if you don't  mind giving me your home address as a reference.\"    \"You can put 'c/o Miss Goodwin, The Thorns, Manor Road, Stedburgh',\"  said Gwen, who wished at any cost to avoid the chance of a letter  being sent to her at her own home. She got a receipt for the ten  shillings on account, and put it carefully away in her purse. She  thought both the shopmen looked at her very inquisitively, but she  took no notice. She did not mean to gratify their curiosity by  explaining the details of how she had incurred the expense. She wished  Netta were with her; it was so much harder to keep up her dignity  alone. With a curt \"Good afternoon!\" she left the china stores and  hurried back to school. She was only just in time, for the second bell  was already ringing. Fortunately the dressing-room was empty, except  for one agitated Junior, who was in too great haste to notice  anything. Gwen scuttled into the Fifth exactly five seconds before  Miss Douglas, and sat down at her desk, exhausted but congratulating  herself. She contrived to write a surreptitious note to Netta, and to  pass it, neatly rolled into a ball, on the waste-paper tray. Its tenor  was calculated to be ambiguous to outsiders, but intelligible to the  initiated.         \"All hail, Protector of the Poor! This is to inform you that       the deed is done--successfully. I thought I was within an       ace of exposure, but things righted themselves, and lo! I       triumphed. For the present the supplier of brittle goods is       satisfied, and for the future--well, I leave it to luck. I       feel like a warrior who has been through a campaign--I'm not       sure if I haven't acquired some wounds. My head is swimming,       and I'm a broken flower for the afternoon. Expect me to       collapse in maths. My brains are capable of nothing more       arduous than the three R's. I am living till four, when I       can have the exhilaration of reciting my breathless       experiences to your sympathetic ear.    \"Yours in abject gratitude,    \"G.G.\"          CHAPTER IX    Keeping Christmas      The end of the term seemed to arrive very rapidly--too quickly for the  amount of work that had to be done, yet too slowly in the estimation  of the three hundred and eleven girls who were looking forward to the  holidays. Exam week came and went, leaving inkstained fingers and a  crop of headaches; mistresses were busy correcting papers; \"swatters\"  were daring to congratulate themselves, and \"slackers\" were bewailing  the difficulty of the questions. Gwen, who had done pretty well on the  whole, considering her handicaps, ventured to think she must be  through in most subjects, and not such a disgrace to the Fifth as to  necessitate her dismissal to the Lower School again, a consummation at  which one or two of her detractors had occasionally hinted in times of  irritation.    The few days left were chiefly occupied with what the girls called  \"scratch lessons\", just something to keep them employed until the  lists were out. A good deal of latitude was allowed to those  rehearsing for the various performances, and though Gwen could not  claim that excuse for exemption, she managed to make a little work  spin out a long way without incurring reproof.    She was tired with the strain of the term; it had needed much effort  to keep up with the rest"]]]
