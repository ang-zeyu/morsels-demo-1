For I  must remark to you, that it has long been much on the decline, and that  our only hope of its revival will consist in your being thoroughly  sensible of its depravation and decay.  It is to Michael Angelo that we  owe even the existence of Raffaelle; it is to him Raffaelle owes the  grandeur of his style.  He was taught by him to elevate his thoughts, and  to conceive his subjects with dignity.  His genius, however, formed to  blaze and to shine, might, like fire in combustible matter, for ever have  lain dormant if it had not caught a spark by its contact with Michael  Angelo: and though it never burst out with that extraordinary heat and  vehemence, yet it must be acknowledged to be a more pure, regular, and  chaste flame.  Though our judgment will upon the whole decide in favour  of Raffaelle: yet he never takes that firm hold and entire possession of  the mind in such a manner as to desire nothing else, and feel nothing  wanting.  The effect of the capital works of Michael Angelo perfectly  correspond to what Bourchardon said he felt from reading Homer.  His  whole frame appeared to himself to be enlarged, and all nature which  surrounded him diminished to atoms.    If we put those great artists in a light of comparison with each other,  Raffaelle had more taste and fancy, Michael Angelo more genius and  imagination.  The one excelled in beauty, the other in energy.  Michael  Angelo has more of the poetical inspiration; his ideas are vast and  sublime; his people are a superior order of beings; there is nothing  about them, nothing in the air of their actions or their attitudes, or  the style and cast of their very limbs or features, that puts one in mind  of their belonging, to our own species.  Raffaelle's imagination is not  so elevated; his figures are not so much disjoined from our own  diminutive race of beings, though his ideas are chaste, noble, and of  great conformity to their subjects.  Michael Angelo's works have a  strong, peculiar, and marked character; they seem to proceed from his own  mind entirely, and that mind so rich and abundant, that he never needed,  or seemed to disdain, to look abroad for foreign help.  Raffaelle's  materials are generally borrowed, though the noble structure is his own.  The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the propriety, beauty,  and majesty of his characters, his judicious contrivance of his  composition, correctness of drawing, purity of taste, and the skilful  accommodation of other men's conceptions to his own purpose.  Nobody  excelled him in that judgment, with which he united to his own  observations on nature the energy of Michael Angelo, and the beauty and  simplicity of the antique.  To the question, therefore, which ought to  hold the first rank, Raffaelle or Michael Angelo, it must be answered,  that if it is to be given to him who possessed a greater combination of  the higher qualities of the art than any other man, there is no doubt but  Raffaelle is the first.  But if, according to Longinus, the sublime,  being the highest excellence that human composition can attain to,  abundantly compensates the absence of every other beauty, and atones for  all other deficiencies, then Michael Angelo demands the preference.    These two extraordinary men carried some of the higher excellences of the  art to a greater degree of perfection than probably they ever arrived at  before.  They certainly have not been excelled, nor equalled since.  Many  of their successors were induced to leave this great road as a beaten  path, endeavouring to surprise and please by something uncommon or new.  When this desire after novelty has proceeded from mere idleness or  caprice, it is not worth the trouble of criticism; but when it has been  in consequence of a busy mind of a peculiar complexion, it is always  striking and interesting, never insipid.    Such is the great style as it appears in those who possessed it at its  height; in this, search after novelty in conception or in treating the  subject has no place.    But there is another style, which, though inferior to the former, has  still great merit, because it shows that those who cultivated it were men  of lively and vigorous imagination.  This I call the original or  characteristical style; this, being less referred to any true architype  existing either in general or particular nature, must be supported by the  painter's consistency in the principles he has assumed, and in the union  and harmony of his whole design.  The excellency of every style, but I  think of the subordinate ones more especially, will very much depend on  preserving that union and harmony between all the component parts, that  they appear to hang well together, as if the whole proceeded from one  mind.  It is in the works of art, as in the characters of men.  The  faults or defects of some men seem to become them when they appear to be  the natural growth, and of a piece with the rest of their character.  A  faithful picture of a mind, though it be not of the most elevated kind,  though it be irregular, wild, and incorrect, yet if it be marked with  that spirit and firmness which characterises works of genius, will claim  attention, and be more striking than a combination of excellences that do  not seem to hang well together, or we may say than a work that possesses  even all excellences, but those in a moderate degree.    One of the strongest marked characters of this kind, which must be  allowed to be subordinate to the great style, is that of Salvator Rosa.  He gives us a peculiar cast of nature, which, though void of all grace,  elegance, and simplicity; though it has nothing of that elevation and  dignity which belongs to the grand style, yet has that sort of dignity  which belongs to savage and uncultivated nature.  But what is most to be  admired in him is the perfect correspondence which he observed between  the subjects which he chose, and his manner of treating them.  Everything  is of a piece: his rocks, trees, sky, even to his handling have the same  rude and wild character which animates his figures.    To him we may contrast the character of Carlo Maratti, who, in my own  opinion, had no great vigour of mind or strength of original genius.  He  rarely seizes the imagination by exhibiting the higher excellences, nor  does he captivate us by that originality which attends the painter who  thinks for himself.  He knew and practised all the rules of art, and from  a composition of Raffaelle, Caracci, and Guido, made up a style, of which  its only fault was, that it had no manifest defects and no striking  beauties, and that the principles of his composition are never blended  together, so as to form one uniform body, original in its kind, or  excellent in any view.    I will mention two other painters who, though entirely dissimilar, yet by  being each consistent with himself, and possessing a manner entirely his  own, have both gained reputation, though for very opposite  accomplishments.    The painters I mean are Rubens and Poussin.  Rubens I mention in this  place, as I think him a remarkable instance of the same mind being seen  in all the various parts of the art.  The whole is so much of a piece  that one can scarce be brought to believe but that if any one of them had  been more correct and perfect, his works would not be so complete as they  now appear.  If we should allow a greater purity and correctness of  drawing, his want of simplicity in composition, colouring, and drapery  would appear more gross.    In his composition his art is too apparent.  His figures have expression,  and act with energy, but without simplicity or dignity.  His colouring,  in which he is eminently skilled, is, notwithstanding, too much of what  we call tinted.  Throughout the whole of his works there is a  proportionable want of that nicety of distinction and elegance of mind  which is required in the higher walks of painting; and to this want it  may be in some degree ascribed that those qualities which make the  excellency of this subordinate style appear in him with their greatest  lustre.  Indeed, the facility with which he invented, the richness of his  composition, the luxuriant harmony and brilliancy of his colouring, so  dazzle the eye, that whilst his works continue before us we cannot help  thinking that all his deficiencies are fully supplied.    Opposed to this florid, careless, loose, and inaccurate style, that of  the simple, careful, pure, and correct style of Poussin seems to be a  complete contrast.    Yet however opposite their characters, in one thing they agreed, both of  them having a perfect correspondence between all the parts of their  respective manners.    One is not sure but every alteration of what is considered as defective  in either, would destroy the effect of the whole.    Poussin lived and conversed with the ancient statues so long, that he may  be said to be better acquainted with then than with the people who were  about him.  I have often thought that he carried his veneration for them  so far as to wish to give his works the air of ancient paintings.  It is  certain he copied some of the antique paintings, particularly the  \"Marriage in the Albrobrandini Palace at Rome,\" which I believe to be the  best relique of those remote ages that has yet been found.    No works of any modern has so much of the air of antique painting as  those of Poussin.  His best performances have a remarkable dryness of  manner, which, though by no means to be recommended for imitation, yet  seems perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which  distinguishes his style.  Like Polidoro he studied them so much, that he  acquired a habit of thinking in their way, and seemed to know perfectly  the actions and gestures they would use on every occasion.    Poussin in the latter part of his life changed from his dry manner to one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#13)"],[1,"fore-brain vesicle has its lateral  walls thickened to form the optic thalami (o.th.), between which a  middle commissure, (m.c.), absent in lower types, stretches like a  great beam across the third ventricle. The original fore-brain is often  called the thalamencephalon, the hemisphere, the prosencephalon,  the olfactory lobes, the rhinencephalon.      Section 121. The parts of mid-brain (mesencephalon) will be easily  recognised. Its cavity is in the adult mammal called the iter; its floor is  differentiated into bundles of fibres, the crura cerebri (c.cb.), figured  also in Figure 4.      Section 122. The cerebellum (metencephalon) consists of a central  mass, the vermis (v.cbm.), and it also has lateral lobes (l.l.),  prolonged into flocculi (f.cbm.), which lastare -em-bedded in pits, [in]  the periotic bone, and on that account render the extraction of the  brain from the cranium far more difficult than it would otherwise be.  The roof of the hind-brain, before and behind the cerebellum,  consists of extremely thin plates of nervous matter. Its floor is greatly  thickened to form the mass of the medulla, and in front a great  transverse track of fibres is specialized, the pons Varolii (p.V.). Its  cavity is called, the fourth ventricle.      Section 123. Figure 2 gives a dorsal view of the rabbit's brain; a  horizontal slice has been taken at the level of the corpus callosum.  The lateral ventricle (i.e., the hollows of the hemisphere) is not yet  opened. A lower cut (Figure 3) exposes this (V.L.). The level of these  slices is approximately indicated in Figure 1 by the lines A and B.  This latter figure will repay careful examination. The arrow, ar.,  plunges into the third ventricle, behind the great middle commissure  (m.c.), and the barb is supposed to lie under the roof of the  mid-brain, the corpora quadrigemina (c.q.). The position of ar. is also  indicated in Figure 1. Before reading on, the beginner should stop a  while here; he should carefully copy or trace our figures and, putting  the book aside, name the parts, and he should then recopy, on an  enlarged scale, and finally draw from memory, correct, and again  draw. By doing this before the brain is dissected a considerable  saving of time is possible.      Section 124. Proceeding from the brain are twelve pairs of cranial  nerves. From the fore-brain spring two pairs, which differ from the  rest of the cranial nerves in being, first of all, hollow outgrowths of  the brain-- the others are from the beginning solid. The first nerve is  the olfactory lobe, which sends numerous filaments through the  ethmoid bone to the olfactory organ. The second is the optic nerve,  the visual sensory nerve.      Section 125. The mid-brain gives rise to only one nerve, the third,  which supplies all the small muscles of the eye (see Section 114),  except the superior oblique and external rectus.      Section 126. The remainder of the nerves spring from the hind-brain.  The fourth pair supply the superior obliques, and the sixth the external  recti; so that III., IV., and VI. are alike purely motor nerves, small and  distributed, to the orbit. The fifth nerve, the trigeminal, is a much  larger and more important one; it is a mixed nerve, having three main  branches, of which the first two are chiefly sensory, the third almost  entirely motor; it lies deeply in the orbit. V1 (see Sheet 9) runs up  over the recti behind the eyeball, it is the ophthalmic branch; V2, the  maxillary branch, runs deeply under the eyeball and emerges in front  of the malar, and V3, the mandibular branch, runs down on the inner  side of the jaw-bone to the jaw muscles and tongue.      Section 127. If the student will now recur to the figures of the dog's  skull (Sheet 6), he will see certain apertures indicated in the cranial  wall. Of these, o.f. is the optic foramen for the exit of nerve II.,  perforating the orbito-sphenoid. Behind this there comes an irregular  aperture, (f.l.a.), the foramen lacerum anterius, giving exit to III., IV.,  VI., and V1. V2 emerges from the foramen rotundum, and V3 from the  foramen ovale, two apertures uniting behind a bony screen.* Just in  front of the bulla is a foramen lacerum medium (f.l.M.), through which  no nerve passes.    * In the rabbit's skull f.l. anterius, the foramen rotundum, and  foramen ovale are not distinct, and there are two condylar foramina  instead of one, through each of which, a moiety of XII. passes.      Section 128. The eighth nerve (auditory) is purely sensory, the nerve  of the special sense of hearing; it runs into the periotic bone, and  breaks up on the labyrinth. The seventh nerve (facial) is almost  entirely motor; it passes through the periotic anterior to VIII., and  emerges by the stylo-mastoid foramen (s.m.f.) behind the bulla, to run  outside the great jaw muscle across the cheek immediately under the  skin (Figure 1).      Section 129. The ninth (glossopharyngeal) nerve is chiefly sensory;  it is the special nerve of taste, and is distributed to the tongue. The  tenth nerve (vagus) arises by a number of roots, and passes out of the  skull, together with IX and XI, by the foramen lacerum -posterium-  [posterius] (f.l.p.). It is a conspicuous white nerve, and runs down the  neck by the side of the common carotid artery. It sends a superior  laryngeal branch (Xa) to the larynx. The left vagus passes ventral to  the aortic arch, and sends a branch (l.x.b.) under this along the  trachea to the larynx-- the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The  corresponding nerve on the right (r.x.b.) loops under the subclavian  artery. The main vagus, after this branching, passes behind the heart  to the oesophagus and along it to the stomach. XI., the spinal  accessory, supplies certain of the neck nerves. XII., the hypoglossal,  runs out of the skull by the condylar foramen (c.f.), is motor, crosses  the roots of XI., X., and IX., passes ventral to the carotid, and breaks  up among the muscles of the tongue and neck.      Section 130. Of the functions of the several parts of the brain there is  still very considerable doubt. With disease or willful destruction of  the cerebral tissue the personal initiative is affected-- the animal  becomes more distinctly a mechanism; the cerebellum is probably  concerned in the coordination of muscular movements; and the  medulla is a centre for the higher and more complicated respiratory  reflexes, yawning, coughing, and so on. The great majority of reflex  actions centre, however, in the spinal cord, and do not affect the  brain.      Section 131. A cross section of the spinal cord is shown in Figure 6,  Sheet 8. It is a cylinder, almost bisected by a dorsal (d.f.) and a  ventral (v.f.) fissure. Through its centre runs a central canal (c.c.),  continuous with the brain ventricles, and lined by ciliated epithelium.  The spinal cord consists of an outer portion, mainly of nervous fibres,  the white matter, and of inner, ganglionated, and more highly  vascular grey matter. (In the cerebrum the grey matter is external, and  the white internal.) The cord, like the brain, is surrounded by a  vascular fibrous investment, and protected from concussion by a  serous fluid. The nerves which emerge from the vertebral column  between the vertebrae, arise, unlike the cranial nerves, by two roots.  The dorsal of these, the sensory root (d.n.), has a swelling upon it, the  dorsal ganglion, and-- by experiments upon living animals-- has been  shown to contain only afferent fibres; the ventral, the motor  root, is without a ganglion, and entirely or mainly motor. The two unite  outside the cord, and thereafter the spinal nerves are both sensory  and motor.      Section 132. Besides the great mass of brain and spinal cord  (cerebro-spinal axis), there is, on either side of the dorsal wall of the  body cavity, a sympathetic nervous chain. The nerve fibres of this  system, like the nerve fibres of invertebrates, are non-medullated. It  may be seen as a greyish thread running close by the common  carotid in the neck (sym., Figure 1); it then runs over the heads of  the ribs in the thorax and close beside the dorsal aorta in the  abdominal region. In the anterior region of the neck it dilates to form  a superior cervical ganglion, and opposite the first rib it forms an  inferior cervical ganglion. Thence, backwards, there is a ganglion on  each sympathetic chain opposite each spinal nerve, and the two  exchange fibres through a thread, the ramus communicans. To the  sympathetic chain is delegated much of the routine work of reflex  control of the bloodvessels and other viscera, which would otherwise  fall upon the spinal cord.      Section 133. There are eight cervical (spinal) nerves, one in front of  the atlas, and one behind each of the cervical vertebrae. The last four  and the first thoracic (spinal) contribute to a leash of nerves running  out to the fore limb, the brachial plexus (plexus, literally network, but  here meaning a plaited cord). The fourth cervical also sends down a  phrenic nerve (p.n., Figure 1), along by the external jugular vein and  the superior caval vein to the diaphragm. The last three lumbar and  the sacral nerves form a sacral plexus, supplying the hind limb.      Section 134. From the sympathetic in the hinder region of the thorax  a nerve, the great splanchnic nerve, arises, and runs, back to a  ganglionated nervous network, just behind the coeliac artery, into  which the vagus also enters; this is the coeliac ganglion, and together  with a similar superior mesenteric ganglion around the corresponding  artery, makes up a subsidiary visceral nervous network, the solar  plexus. A similar and smaller nervous tangle, bearing an inferior  mesenteric ganglion, lies near the inferior mesenteric artery.      Section 135. Finally, we may note the pineal gland and the pituitary  body, as remarkable appendages above and below the  thalamencephalon. Their function, if they have a function, is"]]]
