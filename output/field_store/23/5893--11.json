The violence I did to my proud and hasty nature was so great, that I  could hold out no longer. I was quite spent with it. It seemed  sometimes as if I was inwardly rent, and I have often fallen sick with  the struggle. She did not forbear exclaiming against me, even before  persons of distinction, who came to see me. If I was silent, she took  offence at that yet more, and said that I despised her. She cried me  down, and made complaints to everybody. All this redounded to my honor  and her own disgrace. My reputation was so well established, on account  of my exterior modesty, my devotion, and the great acts of charity  which I did, that nothing could shake it.    Sometimes she ran out into the street, crying out against me. At one  time she exclaimed, \"Am not I very unhappy to have such a mistress?\"  People gathered about her to know what I had done to her; and not  knowing what to say, she answered that I had not spoken to her all the  day. They returned, laughing, and said, \"She has done you no great harm  then.\"    I am surprised at the blindness of confessors, and at their permitting  their penitents to conceal so much of the truth from them. The  confessor of this girl made her pass for a saint. This he said in my  hearing. I answered nothing; for love would not permit me to speak of  my troubles. I should consecrate them all to God by a profound silence.    My husband was out of humor with my devotion. \"What,\" said he, \"you  love God so much, that you love me no longer.\" So little did he  comprehend that the true conjugal love is that which the Lord Himself  forms in the heart that loves Him.    Oh, Thou who art pure and holy, Thou didst imprint in me from the first  such a love of chastity, that there was nothing in the world which I  would not have undergone to possess and preserve it.    I endeavored to be agreeable to my husband in anything, and to please  him in everything he could require of me. God gave me such a purity of  soul at that time, that I had not so much as a bad thought. Sometimes  my husband said to me, \"One sees plainly that you never lose the  presence of God.\"    The world, seeing I quit it, persecuted and turned me into ridicule. I  was its entertainment, and the subject of its fables. It could not bear  that a woman, scarce twenty years of age, should thus make war against  it, and overcome. My mother-in-law took part with the world, and blamed  me for not doing many things that in her heart she would have been  highly offended had I done them. I was as one lost, and alone; so  little communion had I with the creature, farther than necessity  required. I seemed to experience literally those words of Paul, \"I live  yet, no more I, but Christ liveth in me.\" His operations were so  powerful, so sweet, and so secret, all together, that I could not  express them. We went into the country on some business. Oh! what  unutterable communications did I there experience in retirement!    I was insatiable for prayer. I arose at four o'clock in the morning to  pray. I went very far to the church, which was so situated, that the  coach could not come to it. There was a steep hill to go down and  another to ascend. All that cost me nothing; I had such a longing  desire to meet with my God, as my only good, who on His part was  graciously forward to give Himself to His poor creature, and for it to  do even visible miracles. Such as saw me lead a life so very different  from the women of the world said I was a fool. They attributed it to  stupidity. Sometimes they said, \"What can all this mean? Some people  think this lady has parts, but nothing of them appears.\" If I went into  company, often I could not speak; so much was I engaged within, so  inward with the Lord, as not to attend to anything else. If any near me  spoke, I heard nothing. I generally took one with me, that this might  not appear. I took some work, to hide under that appearance the real  employ of my heart. When I was alone, the work dropped out of my hand.  I wanted to persuade a relation of my husband's to practice prayer. She  thought me a fool, for depriving myself of all the amusements of the  age. But the Lord opened her eyes, to make her despise them. I could  have wished to teach all the world to love God; and thought it depended  only on them to feel what I felt. The Lord made use of my thinking to  gain many souls to Himself.    The good father I have spoken of, who was the instrument of my  conversion, made me acquainted with Genevieve Granger, prioress of the  Benedictines, one of the greatest servants of God of her time. She  proved of very great service to me. My confessor, who had told everyone  that I was a saint before, when so full of miseries, and so far from  the condition to which the Lord in His mercy had now brought me, seeing  I placed a confidence in the father of whom I have spoken, and that I  steered in a road which was unknown to him, declared openly against me.  The monks of his order persecuted me much. They even preached publicly  against me, as a person under a delusion.    My husband and mother-in-law, who till now had been indifferent about  this confessor, then joined him and ordered me to leave off prayer, and  the exercise of piety; that I could not do. There was carried on a  conversation within me, very different from that which passed without.  I did what I could to hinder it from appearing, but could not. The  presence of so great a Master manifested itself, even on my  countenance. That pained my husband, he sometimes told me. I did what I  could to hinder it from being noticed, but was not able completely to  hide it. I was so much inwardly occupied that I knew not what I ate. I  made as if I ate some kinds of meat, though I did not take any. This  deep inward attention suffered me scarcely to hear or see anything. I  still continued to use many severe mortifications and austerities. They  did not in the least diminish the freshness of my countenance.    I had often grievous fits of sickness and no consolation in life,  except in the practice of prayer, and in seeing Mother Granger. How  dear did these cost me, especially the former! Is this esteeming the  cross as I ought?--should I not rather say that prayer to me was  recompensed with the cross, and the cross with prayer. Inseparable  gifts united in my heart and life! When your eternal light arose in my  soul, how perfectly it reconciled me and made you the object of my  love! From the moment I received Thee I have never been free from the  cross, nor it seems without prayer--though for a long time I thought  myself deprived thereof, which exceedingly augmented my afflictions.    My confessor at first exerted his efforts to hinder me from practicing  prayer, and from seeing Mother Granger. He violently stirred up my  husband and mother-in-law to hinder me from praying. The method they  took was to watch me from morning until night. I dared not go out from  my mother-in-law's room, or from my husband's bedside. Sometimes I  carried my work to the window, under a pretense of seeing better, in  order to relieve myself with some moment's repose. They came to watch  me very closely, to see if I did not pray instead of working. When my  husband and mother-in-law played cards, if I did turn toward the fire,  they watched to see if I continued my work or shut my eyes. If they  observed I closed them, they would be in a fury against me for several  hours. What is most strange, when my husband went out, having some days  of health, he would not allow me to pray in his absence. He marked my  work, and sometimes, after he was just gone out, returning immediately,  if he found me in prayer he would be in a rage. In vain I said,  \"Surely, sir, what matters it what I do when you are absent, if I be  assiduous in attending you when you are present?\" That would not  satisfy him; he insisted that I should no more pray in his absence than  in his presence.    I believe there is hardly a torment equal to that of being ardently  drawn to retirement, and not having it in one's power to be retired.    O my God, the war they raised to hinder me from loving Thee did but  augment my love. While they were striving to prevent my addresses to  Thee, thou drewest me into an inexpressible silence. The more they  labored to separate me from Thee, the more closely didst Thou unite me  to Thyself. The flame of Thy love was kindled, and kept up by  everything that was done to extinguish it.    Often through compliance I played at piquet with my husband. At such  times I was even more interiorly attracted than if I had been at  church. I was scarce able to contain the fire which burned in my soul,  which had all the fervor of what men call love, but nothing of its  impetuosity. The more ardent, the more peaceable it was. This fire  gained strength from everything that was done to suppress it. And the  spirit of prayer was nourished and increased from their contrivances  and endeavors to disallow me any time for practicing it. I loved  without considering a motive or reason for loving. Nothing passed in my  head, but much in the innermost recesses of my soul. I thought not  about any recompense, gift, or favor, which He could bestow or I  receive. The Well-beloved was Himself the only object which attracted  my heart. I could not contemplate His attributes. I knew nothing else,  but to love and to suffer. Ignorance more truly learned than any  science of the doctors, since it taught me so well Jesus Christ  crucified and brought me to be in love with His holy cross. I could  then have wished to die, in order to be inseparably united to Him who  so powerfully attracted my heart. As all this passed in the will, the  imagination and the understanding being absorbed in it, I knew not what  to say, having never read or heard of such a state as I experienced. I  dreaded delusion and feared that all was not right, for before this I  had known nothing of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],[0,"An American Suffragette (#13)"],[1,"rs.    \"It is because so wide and gracious to us are the possibilities of the  future, so impossible is a return to the past, so deadly is a passive  acquiescence in the present, that to-day we are found everywhere raising  our strange new cry, 'Labor, and the training that fits us for labor!'\"    \"You recognize it, of course?\" Silvia said to Dr. Earl, but he shook his  head, and Frank answered, \"It's Olive Schreiner, isn't it? She does good  work, but I've never read anything that compared with that book on  'Woman and Economics,' and when an American writer has the whole world  sitting up and taking notice, I don't see why we don't boost her game.\"    There was a little buzz and stir while slips of paper and pencils were  distributed to the audience, and the questions collected for the next  speaker.    The presiding officer made the usual preliminary remarks, and introduced  Miss Renner, who gathered up the goodly sheaf of white slips in her  hands and ran over them as if looking for some query that would make a  specially apt beginning. Her face lit up as she came across one with  which she was evidently familiar.    \"This is a favorite question of mine,\" she said cheerfully. \"I should  miss it dreadfully if it failed to turn up, but it is such a troublesome  and comprehensive question to answer that I have set the reply to music,  and will have it sung for you, in order that you may all remember it.  The question is, 'What have Colorado women done with the ballot?' I  don't, myself, consider that a fair question, since none of us come down  to Philadelphia or New York or Pittsburg or any of the other cities of  sweetness and light and ask what you men have done with your  all-powerful vote, but this seems to be the main one, especially to the  masculine mind.\"    Dr. Earl laughed, for he had written the question, and seating herself  at the piano, Miss Renner looked up at a merry-faced girl, who began  singing to her rippling accompaniment a song of miraculous changes which  should have ensued upon woman's enfranchisement, and concluded with a  long chant, recounting some of the more notable achievements of the  voting woman, ranging all the way from joint ownership of children and  property, minimum salary laws, juvenile courts, medical inspection of  school children, State institutions built and endowed, equality in  inheritance and a host of other things, up to the adoption by her State  of the initiative and referendum.    After that, Miss Renner had her audience with her until she dropped the  last twist of paper on the table beside her. \"You ask me why it took us  so many years to pass a good law regulating child labor, and why we have  failed in limiting the hours of woman's labor. As to the first, it is  true that our law was by no means equal to yours, but we had the means  to enforce it, and as a consequence we have little or no child labor.  You have a good statute, one of the best in the Union\"--there was a  ripple of applause--\"but in addition to this excellent law prohibiting  child labor,\" she went on evenly, \"you have in this city alone over  twenty thousand child wage-earners.    \"When we have gone to our legislatures asking for laws for the  protection of the weak, we have generally obtained them easily, when  they did not interfere with 'big business.' It took Illinois women nine  years to get a State Home for children. We passed such a law without  any effort whatever. In two-thirds of the States of the Union women are  trying to make mothers co-equal guardians of their children, and trying  in vain. That was the first law our enfranchised women wrote upon our  statute books. One only learns to understand these things by experience.  You may find it hard to see why railroads should go into a deal to  defeat an eight-hour law for women, but that statute was flagged by a  Pullman palace car towel and fell asleep at the switch, because that  company complained that it couldn't get a change of sheets unless  laundry girls could be compelled to work overtime. You don't dream when  you talk of 'big business' to what little business it will descend.\"    There was a sudden hush, and she flung out her hands with an impulsive  gesture, and there was a passionate earnestness in her voice that  gripped her hearers. \"Let me tell you something you do not know when you  hold the women in the suffrage States responsible for conditions they  are the first to deplore. A handful of men in this city have more to do  with Western industries and their regulation than have both the men and  women. We have steel works; their policy is dictated from lower  Broadway. We have smelters; they are closed at the order of a syndicate  in this city. We have railroads, all of them controlled by your fellow  citizens, and it was the deals entered into between the representatives  of these interests and our local corporations that defeated the  eight-hour law for women, and every bit of reform legislation pledged to  the people. It was this condition, this failure of alleged democracy,  that made us go on record for real democracy, for the initiative that  makes it possible for us to enact the laws our representatives are  cajoled into pigeon-holing, for the referendum that enables us to scotch  the snake so that the people may have a chance to kill it. This was the  first great fundamental reform which the women demanded, and it was  owing to the work of education they began twenty years ago, and kept up  untiringly, that Colorado has won this great victory. Woman suffrage is  not alone for women, or to enable us to secure certain readjustments of  law. It is for our country, which cannot exist half enfranchised and  half irresponsible, half democracy and half a feudalism; half of it  privileged to shirk or exercise its civic rights, and half denied aught  but the burden of those rights. Women need the franchise if only to make  their influence, of which we hear so much, effective, but more than they  need the ballot, this nation needs the active devotion of its women to  transmute to golden fulfillment its leaden life; it needs, it must have  all that we can give it, your life and mine; if it is to go forward, its  sons and daughters must go forward--together!\"    There was generous applause, and the two young men followed Miss  Holland, and she presented Dr. Earl and was about to introduce his  brother, when Miss Renner held out both hands to him.    \"Hast thou found me, O mine enemy,\" she cried. \"I'm awfully glad to see  you, Frank. I was much minded to tell how you helped me get my dove bill  through, but I feared they might hold you responsible for the defeat of  the eight-hour law and turn and rend you.\"    \"You promised never to reveal any of my good deeds,\" he answered. \"Keep  it out of the papers, Miss Holland. I can't afford to lose prestige as  the exponent of the Mammon of Unrighteousness.\"    \"Unfortunately, he is a great god with legislatures, East as well as  West,\" answered Miss Holland, and then they all went out together.          CHAPTER XII    A TUBERCULAR KNEE AND A WORRIED SURGEON      Dr. Earl found his hands uncommonly full for the next few weeks. What  with the endless detail attendant upon the arrangements for his new  offices, and the perfection of his equipment, it seemed as if there were  not enough hours in the day to meet all the calls upon him. Leonora  looked aggrieved, and Hilda complained loudly that he had deserted them.    The spectacular manner in which the yellower part of the New York press  had handled his first case after his return, brought him telephone calls  and personal visits from many old patients, and a goodly number from new  ones, not to mention freaky interviews with persons representing all  sorts of cults. He was asked to address half a dozen different branches  of the New Thought movement. The Society for the Propagation of Esoteric  Buddhism asked him to tell them of his experiences in Hindoostan;  \"Purple Mother\" and \"Besant\" Theosophists sent committees to wait on  him, and various believers in Spiritist exploitations, astrologists,  psychometrists and all sorts and conditions of dabblers in occultism  pestered him with letters, circulars and requests of every conceivable  nature.    It had been no part of his plan to return to his native land and set up  a practice by which he should exploit to the world the results of his  study. A real student, he knew very well that a lifetime would be all  too short to devote to the as yet but little known field of mental  therapeutics, and nothing could have been more foreign to his character,  individually or professionally, than the fanfare of trumpets with which  his return had been heralded. The principles which he wished to prove  must be brought home to his profession if they were to be of great and  lasting benefit, and the publicity and advertising which a man of a  different calibre might have enjoyed, were annoying in the extreme to  Earl. He was still a young man, and modest withal, and he felt that  nothing could be more detrimental with the men whose regard he wished to  secure and hold, so he declined all invitations to speak, all requests  for articles or interviews, and gave himself up to getting back into  the harness. His patients, both old and new, took up more time than he  could have hoped for, and before the middle of summer he found himself  not only well launched in his profession, but with all that he could  possibly find time to do, and work piling up ahead of him, so that he  could only promise indefinitely when the Ramseys urged him to come down  to their Newport place, and Leonora had to put up with fractions of  Sundays until she and her mother left for Bar Harbor.    There were times when that young lady was by no means certain that she  wished to marry a successful physician. \"You wouldn't like me any better  if I were unsuccessful?\" he asked teasingly, but she came back to her  point, and "]]]
