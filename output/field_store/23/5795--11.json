Meanwhile, the Prophet looked on until, tiring of the monotonous  spectacle, he departed to amuse himself with a Jewess whose husband had  just perished.    He continued these conquests until, at his death, in 632, he was the  master of nearly all Arabia and revered almost as a god. Yet, when Omar,  his first lieutenant, captured Jerusalem in 636, he ensured the  conquered Jews and Christians free exercise of their religion, and the  security of their persons and their goods. But when the Crusaders took  Jerusalem in 1099, they massacred all the Mohammedans, and burnt the  Jews alive. It is estimated that 70,000 persons were put to death in  less than a week to attest the superior morality of the Christian faith.    The successors of Mohammed, the Caliphs, in less than a century  conquered Syria, Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, Turkestan, Spain, Northern  Africa, Sicily, and Southern France. Today, 160,000,000 are followers of  Mohammed,--a man who began as a humble religious leader, and ended as an  adroit politician and powerful general; a man who hid during battles,  who often broke faith with friend and foe alike, a charlatan and  demagogue of general intellectual incompetency, and a victim of mental  disease.      JESUS    When we come to consider the life of Jesus, a far different and more  intricate problem is met with. None but the most illogical and purposely  ignorant of religious apologists will admit that the life of Jesus has  been misrepresented by his followers to suit their particular aims. Had  the followers of the moralist Epictetus or the Rabbi Hillel written  lives of these two teachers they would be quite similar to the reputed  life of Jesus. The moral sentiments attributed to Christ in the Gospels  were borrowed from the Jewish rabbis and the numerous cults that  flourished in that age. The birth, death, and resurrection of Christ is  quite similar to the myths of that time concerning the savior gods  Adonis, Isis, Osiris, Attis, Mithra, and a multitude of others. (_For a  full exposition of the subject, the reader is referred to E. Carpenter,  \"Pagan and Christian Creeds.\"_)    The evidence for the point of view that Jesus was actually a historic  character is so slight that such scholars as J. M. Robertson, Prof. W.  B. Smith, Professor Drews, Dr. P. L. Couchoud, and many others deny the  historic reality of Christ on the ground that the Gospels are totally  unreliable as history, that Paul bears no witness to a human Jesus, and  that the pagan and Jewish writers are strangely silent about the Messiah  Jesus.    There are in existence only twenty-four lines from Jewish and Pagan  writers referring to Jesus. These include a reference in Tacitus'  Annals, and brief references by Suetonius and Pliny the Younger. These  three references are considered spurious by many scholars, and even if  they were all to be accepted it would mean that the total pagan  testimony as to the historicity of Jesus is confined to three very vague  and brief references written a century after the reputed time of Jesus.  The longest reference to Jesus is in the writings of the Jewish  historian, Josephus. The passage referring to Jesus in his \"Jewish  Antiquities\" has been considered as spurious even by conservative  scholars. A group of scholars has always deemed it very probable,  however, that this spurious reference may have replaced an unfavorable  reference to Jesus in the original. Working on this theory, Dr. Eisler  has purged of interpolations this work by a painstaking and scholarly  investigation.    However, it must be pointed out that with regard to Jesus' actual  existence, what divided the Christians and non-Christians was not the  question whether or not Jesus existed; but the vastly more pertinent  and essentially different question whether or not the obscure Galilean  carpenter, executed by a Roman governor as king of the Jews, was really  a superhuman being who had overcome death, the longed-for-savior of  mankind, foretold by the Prophets, the only-begotten Son of God Himself.    To the Jews, Jesus was indeed a heretic and an agitator of the lower  orders; to the pagans, he was a magician who through sham miracles and  with subversive words had incited the people to rebellion, and as a  leader of a gang of desperate men had attempted to seize the royal crown  of Judaea, as others had done before and after him. The non-Christian  writers referred to Jesus as a wizard, a demagogue, and a rebel.    We are fortunate, at this date, to have brought to our attention a  masterful work by Dr. Robert Eisler, a work which will be as  revolutionary to the study of Christianity as was Darwin's \"Origin of  the Species\" in the realms of science; and, similarly, the former work  will be the basis upon which much progress will be made in a great  field. Dr. Eisler unfolds a great mass of hitherto unknown information  concerning the life, the actual appearance, and the doings of Jesus. He  definitely establishes the proof of Jesus' actual existence, and makes  clear many hitherto obscure utterances and deeds of this Prophet.    The descriptions which follow are based on the material in this work of  Dr. Eisler, \"The Messiah Jesus.\"    In the complete statement of Josephus on Pilate's governorship, we find,  \"At that time there appeared a certain man of magical power, if it is  permissible to call him a man, whom certain Greeks call a Son of God,  but his disciples, the True Prophet, said to raise the dead, and heal  all diseases. His nature and his form were human; a man of simple  appearance, mature age, small in stature, three cubits high,  _hunchbacked_, with a long face, long nose, and meeting eyebrows, so  that they who see him might be affrighted, with scanty hair but with a  parting in the middle of his head, after the manner of the Nazarites,  and with an undeveloped beard. Only in semblance was he superhuman for  he gave some astonishing and spectacular exhibitions. But again, if I  look at his commonplace physique, I, for one, cannot call him an angel.  And everything whatsoever he wrought through some invisible power, he  wrought through some word and a command. Some said of him, 'Our first  law giver is risen again, and displays many healings and magic arts.  Others said, 'He is sent from God.' Howbeit in many things he disobeyed  the law and kept not the Sabbath according to our fathers' custom.    \"And many of the multitude followed after him and accepted his  teachings, and many souls were excited, thinking that thereby the Jewish  tribes might be freed from Roman hands. But it was his custom most of  the time to abide over against the city on the Mount of Olives, and  there, too, he bestowed his healings upon the people. And there  assembled unto him of helpers one hundred and fifty, and a multitude of  the mob.    \"Now, when they saw his power, how he accomplished whatsoever he would  by a magic word, and when they had made known to him their will, that he  should enter into the city, cut down the Roman troops, and Pilate and  rule over us, he disdained us not. And having all flocked into  Jerusalem, they raised an uproar against Pilate, uttering blasphemies  alike against God and against Caesar.    \"And when knowledge of it came to the Jewish leaders, they assembled  together, with the high priests and spake, 'We are powerless and too  weak to withstand the Romans. But seeing that the 'bow is bent,' we will  go and impart to Pilate what we have heard, and we shall be safe, lest  he hear of it from others and we be robbed of our substance and  ourselves slaughtered, and the children of Israel dispersed.    \"And they went and imparted the matter to Pilate, and he sent and had  many of the multitude slain. And he had that wonder-worker brought up,  and after instituting an inquiry concerning him, he passed this sentence  upon him, 'He is a malefactor, a rebel, a robber thirsting for the  crown.' And they took him and crucified him according to the custom of  their fathers.\"    Such is the history of Jesus as contrasted with the myth of Jesus in the  New Testament. This description of the actual appearance of Jesus for  the first time gives us a clue to the mental and physical  characteristics of this Prophet.    It must be borne in mind that at the time that Jesus achieved manhood,  his people and his nation were under the complete domination of Rome,  and oppressed by a race whom the Jews looked upon as cursed barbarians  and idolaters. The country was overrun with religious zealots who  stormed over the cities and villages preaching the immediate destruction  of the world and the proximity of the long-awaited coming of the  Messiah.    The fact that Jesus had to bear the hard fate of a deformed body may go  far in helping to explain this remarkable character. It is common  knowledge how frequently weak and deformed children have to suffer from  the cruelty and neglect of environment, a factor which cannot but  produce a peculiar reaction on the childish mind which has a  far-reaching effect in later life. This accounts for Jesus' indifference  towards his mother and brothers; of a delicate constitution, he must  have suffered from insults a great deal more than the others, which  throws some light on the severe punishment demanded by Jesus for  comparatively harmless insults. Under such circumstances it is easy to  explain how every \"neighbor,\" and next-of-kin, although to the weak  naturally an \"enemy,\" came to be included in the sphere of that  all-embracing love which is the nucleus of Jesus' teaching.

I have not seen her, and have rarely heard from her, for  nearly twelve months, now! Therefore I packed up post-haste and here I  am! I came to you, because, from what little I have heard of you, and  of your father, I judged you to be the right kind of friends to  consult.\"...    \"You have not seen her for twelve months?\"    Helen's voice was almost inaudible, and she was trembling dreadfully.    \"That's a fact, my dear. And now, what are we going to tell Harry  Leroux?\"    It was a question, the answer to which was by no means evident at  a glance; and leaving Helen Cumberly face to face with this new and  horrible truth which had brought Denise Ryland hotfoot from Paris to  London, let us glance, for a moment, into the now familiar room of  Detective-Inspector Dunbar at Scotland Yard.    He had returned from his interrogation of Brian; and he received the  report of Sowerby, respecting the late Mrs. Vernon's maid. The girl,  Sergeant Sowerby declared, was innocent of complicity, and could only  depose to the fact that her late mistress took very little luggage with  her on the occasions of her trips to Scotland. With his notebook open  before him upon the table, Dunbar was adding this slight item to his  notes upon the case, when the door opened, and the uniformed constable  entered, saluted, and placed an envelope in the Inspector's hand.    \"From the commissioner!\" said Sowerby, significantly.    With puzzled face, Dunbar opened the envelope and withdrew the  commissioner's note. It was very brief:--    \"M. Gaston Max, of the Paris Police, is joining you in the Palace  Mansions murder case. You will cooperate with him from date above.\"    \"MAX!\" said Dunbar, gazing astoundedly at his subordinate.    Certainly it was a name which might well account for the amazement  written upon the inspector's face; for it was the name of admittedly the  greatest criminal investigator in Europe!    \"What the devil has the case to do with the French police?\" muttered  Sowerby, his ruddy countenance exhibiting a whole history of wonderment.    The constable, who had withdrawn, now reappeared, knocking deferentially  upon the door, throwing it open, and announcing:    \"Mr. Gaston Max, to see Detective-Inspector Dunbar.\"    Bowing courteously upon the threshold, appeared a figure in a dazzling  check traveling-coat--a figure very novel, and wholly unforgettable.    \"I am honored to meet a distinguished London colleague,\" he said in  perfect English, with a faint American accent.    Dunbar stepped across the room with outstretched hand, and cordially  shook that of the famous Frenchman.    \"I am the more honored,\" he declared, gallantly playing up to the  other's courtesy. \"This is Detective-Sergeant Sowerby, who is acting  with me in the case.\"    M. Gaston Max bowed low in acknowledgment of the introduction.    \"It is a pleasure to meet Detective-Sergeant Sowerby,\" he declared.    These polite overtures being concluded then, and the door being closed,  the three detectives stood looking at one another in momentary silence.  Then Dunbar spoke with blunt directness:    \"I am very pleased to have you with us, Mr. Max,\" he said; \"but might I  ask what your presence in London means?\"    M. Gaston Max shrugged in true Gallic fashion.    \"It means, monsieur,\" he said, \"--murder--and MR. KING!\"          XII    MR. GIANAPOLIS      It will prove of interest at this place to avail ourselves of an  opportunity denied to the police, and to inquire into the activities of  Mr. Soames, whilom employee of Henry Leroux.    Luke Soames was a man of unpleasant character; a man ever seeking  advancement--advancement to what he believed to be an ideal state, viz.:  the possession of a competency; and to this ambition he subjugated all  conflicting interests--especially the interests of others. From narrow  but honest beginnings, he had developed along lines ever growing  narrower until gradually honesty became squeezed out. He formed the  opinion that wealth was unobtainable by dint of hard work; and indeed  in a man of his limited intellectual attainments, this was no more than  true.    At the period when he becomes of interest, he had just discovered  himself a gentleman-at-large by reason of his dismissal from the  services of a wealthy bachelor, to whose establishment in Piccadilly he  had been attached in the capacity of valet. There was nothing definite  against his character at this time, save that he had never remained for  long in any one situation.    His experience was varied, if his references were limited; he had served  not only as valet, but also as chauffeur, as steward on an ocean liner,  and, for a limited period, as temporary butler in an American household  at Nice.    Soames' banking account had increased steadily, but not at a rate  commensurate with his ambitions; therefore, when entering his name and  qualifications in the books of a certain exclusive employment agency  in Mayfair he determined to avail himself, upon this occasion, of  his comparative independence by waiting until kindly Fate should cast  something really satisfactory in his path.    Such an opening occurred very shortly after his first visit to the  agent. He received a card instructing him to call at the office in order  to meet a certain Mr. Gianapolis. Quitting his rooms in Kennington, Mr.  Soames, attired in discreet black, set out to make the acquaintance of  his hypothetical employer.    He found Mr. Gianapolis to be a little and very swarthy man, who held  his head so low as to convey the impression of having a pronounced  stoop; a man whose well-cut clothes and immaculate linen could not  redeem his appearance from a constitutional dirtiness. A jet black  mustache, small, aquiline features, an engaging smile, and very dark  brown eyes, viciously crossed, made up a personality incongruous with  his sheltering silk hat, and calling aloud for a tarboosh and a linen  suit, a shop in a bazaar, or a part in the campaign of commercial  brigandage which, based in the Levant, spreads its ramifications  throughout the Orient, Near and Far.    Mr. Gianapolis had the suave speech and smiling manner. He greeted  Soames not as one greets a prospective servant, but as one welcomes  an esteemed acquaintance. Following a brief chat, he proposed an  adjournment to a neighboring saloon bar; and there, over cocktails, he  conversed with Mr. Soames as one crook with another.    Soames was charmed, fascinated, yet vaguely horrified; for this  man smilingly threw off the cloak of hypocrisy from his companion's  shoulders, and pretended, with the skill of his race, equally to nudify  his own villainy.    \"My dear Mr. Soames!\" he said, speaking almost perfect English, but with  the sing-song intonation of the Greek, and giving all his syllables  an equal value--\"you are the man I am looking for; and I can make your  fortune.\"    This was entirely in accordance with Mr. Soames' own views, and he  nodded, respectfully.    \"I know,\" continued Gianapolis, proffering an excellent Egyptian  cigarette, \"that you were cramped in your last situation--that you were  misunderstood\"...    Soames, cigarette in hand, suppressed a start, and wondered if he were  turning pale. He selected a match with nervous care.    \"The little matter of the silver spoons,\" continued Gianapolis, smiling  fraternally, \"was perhaps an error of judgment. Although\"--patting the  startled Soames upon the shoulder--\"they were a legitimate perquisite;  I am not blaming you. But it takes so long to accumulate a really useful  balance in that petty way. Now\"--he glanced cautiously about him--\"I  can offer you a post under conditions which will place you above the  consideration of silver spoons!\"    Soames, hastily finishing his cocktail, sought for words; but  Gianapolis, finishing his own, blandly ordered two more, and, tapping  Soames upon the knee, continued:    \"Then that matter of the petty cash, and those trifling irregularities  in the wine-bill, you remember?--when you were with Colonel Hewett in  Nice?\"...    Soames gripped the counter hard, staring at the newly arrived cocktail  as though it were hypnotizing him.    \"These little matters,\" added Gianapolis, appreciatively sipping from  his own glass, \"which would weigh heavily against your other references,  in the event of their being mentioned to any prospective employer\"...    Soames knew beyond doubt that his face was very pale indeed.    \"These little matters, then,\" pursued Gianapolis, \"all go to prove to ME  that you are a man of enterprise and spirit--that you are the very man  I require. Now I can offer you a post in the establishment of Mr. Henry  Leroux, the novelist. The service will be easy. You will be required  to attend to callers and to wait at table upon special occasions. There  will be no valeting, and you will have undisputed charge of the pantry  and wine-cellar. In short, you will enjoy unusual liberty. The salary,  you would say? It will be the same as that which you received from Mr.  Mapleson\"...    Soames raised his head drearily; he felt himself in the toils; he felt  himself a mined man.    \"It isn't a salary,\" he began, \"which\"...    \"My dear Mr. Soames,\" said Gianapolis, tapping him confidentially upon  the knee again--\"my dear Soames, it isn't the salary, I admit, which you  enjoyed whilst in the services of Colonel Hewett in a similar capacity.  But this is not a large establishment, and the duties are light.  Furthermore, there will be--extras.\"    \"Extras?\"    Mr. Soames' eye brightened, and under the benignant influence of the  cocktails his courage began to return.    \"I do not refer,\" smiled Mr. Gianapolis, \"to perquisites! The extras  will be monetary. Another two pounds per week\"...    \"Two pounds!\"    \"Bringing your salary up to a nice round figure; the additional amount  will be paid to you from another source. You will receive the latter"]]]
