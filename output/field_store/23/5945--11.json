Help me to herd  them, Akela.\"    The herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the  village Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the temple  blowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him  by the gate. \"That is because I have killed Shere Khan,\" he said  to himself. But a shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the  villagers shouted: \"Sorcerer! Wolf's brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get  hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot,  Buldeo, shoot!\"    The old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed  in pain.    \"More sorcery!\" shouted the villagers. \"He can turn bullets. Buldeo,  that was thy buffalo.\"    \"Now what is this?\" said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker.    \"They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,\" said Akela,  sitting down composedly. \"It is in my head that, if bullets mean  anything, they would cast thee out.\"    \"Wolf! Wolf's cub! Go away!\" shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the  sacred tulsi plant.    \"Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I  am a wolf. Let us go, Akela.\"    A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: \"Oh, my son,  my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast  at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo  says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo's death.\"    \"Come back, Messua!\" shouted the crowd. \"Come back, or we will stone  thee.\"    Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in  the mouth. \"Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they tell  under the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son's life.  Farewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly  than their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!\"    \"Now, once more, Akela,\" he cried. \"Bring the herd in.\"    The buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly  needed Akela's yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,  scattering the crowd right and left.    \"Keep count!\" shouted Mowgli scornfully. \"It may be that I have stolen  one of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you  well, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my  wolves and hunt you up and down your street.\"    He turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he  looked up at the stars he felt happy. \"No more sleeping in traps for me,  Akela. Let us get Shere Khan's skin and go away. No, we will not hurt  the village, for Messua was kind to me.\"    When the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the  horrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a  bundle on his head, trotting across at the steady wolf's trot that eats  up the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew  the conches louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered  the story of his adventures in the jungle, till he ended by saying that  Akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man.    The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the  hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf's cave.    \"They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,\" shouted Mowgli, \"but  I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.\"    Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and  her eyes glowed as she saw the skin.    \"I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into  this cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter  would be the hunted. It is well done.\"    \"Little Brother, it is well done,\" said a deep voice in the thicket.  \"We were lonely in the jungle without thee,\" and Bagheera came running  to Mowgli's bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and  Mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit,  and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon  it, and called the old call to the Council, \"Look--look well, O Wolves,\"  exactly as he had called when Mowgli was first brought there.    Ever since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader,  hunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered the call  from habit; and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen  into, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating  bad food, and many were missing. But they came to the Council Rock, all  that were left of them, and saw Shere Khan's striped hide on the rock,  and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet. It  was then that Mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all  by itself, and he shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling  skin, and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left,  while Gray Brother and Akela howled between the verses.    \"Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept my word?\" said Mowgli. And the wolves  bayed \"Yes,\" and one tattered wolf howled:    \"Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of  this lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.\"    \"Nay,\" purred Bagheera, \"that may not be. When ye are full-fed, the  madness may come upon you again. Not for nothing are ye called the Free  People. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves.\"    \"Man-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,\" said Mowgli. \"Now I will hunt  alone in the jungle.\"    \"And we will hunt with thee,\" said the four cubs.    So Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from  that day on. But he was not always alone, because, years afterward, he  became a man and married.    But that is a story for grown-ups.          Mowgli's Song         THAT HE SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE       DANCED ON SHERE KHAN'S HIDE         The Song of Mowgli--I, Mowgli, am singing.  Let the jungle          listen to the things I have done.         Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill!  At the gates in the          twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!         He ate and he drank.  Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou          drink again?  Sleep and dream of the kill.         I am alone on the grazing-grounds.  Gray Brother, come to me!          Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!         Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls          with the angry eyes.  Drive them to and fro as I order.         Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan?  Wake, oh, wake!  Here come I,          and the bulls are behind.         Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot.  Waters of          the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan?         He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should          fly.  He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches.  Little          bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?         Ow!  He is there.  Ahoo!  He is there.  Under the feet of Rama          lies the Lame One!  Up, Shere Khan!         Up and kill!  Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!         Hsh!  He is asleep.  We will not wake him, for his strength is          very great.  The kites have come down to see it.  The black          ants have come up to know it.  There is a great assembly in his          honor.         Alala!  I have no cloth to wrap me.  The kites will see that I am          naked.  I am ashamed to meet all these people.         Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan.  Lend me thy gay striped coat that I          may go to the Council Rock.         By the Bull that bought me I made a promise--a little promise.          Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.         With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the          hunter, I will stoop down for my gift.         Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his coat for the love          that he bears me.  Pull, Gray Brother!  Pull, Akela!  Heavy is          the hide of Shere Khan.         The Man Pack are angry.  They throw stones and talk child's talk.          My mouth is bleeding.  Let me run away.         Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my          brothers.  We will leave the lights of the village and go to          the low moon.         Waters of the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out.  I did          them no harm, but they were afraid of me.  Why?         Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and          the village gates are shut.  Why?         As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the          village and the jungle.  Why?         I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My          mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but          my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.          Why?         These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the          spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it          falls.  Why?         I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.         All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.  Look--look          well, O Wolves!         Ahae!  My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand.          The White Seal         Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,          And black are the waters that sparkled so green.       The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us          At rest in the hollows that rustle between.       Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow,          Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!       The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,          Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas!

WORTHY OF CULTIVATION.--While, therefore, grace of manner, politeness  of behavior, elegance of demeanor, and all the arts that contribute to make  life pleasant and beautiful, are worthy of cultivation, it must not be at  the expense of the more solid and enduring qualities of honesty, sincerity,  and truthfulness. The fountain of beauty must be in the heart more than in  the eye, and if it does not tend to produce beautiful life and noble  practice, it will prove of comparatively little avail. Politeness of manner  is not worth much, unless it is accompanied by polite actions.    [Illustration]    {73}    Influence of Good Character.     \"Unless above himself he can    Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!\"--DANIEL.        \"Character is moral order seen through the medium of an individual      nature--Men of character are the conscience of the society to which      they belong.\"--EMERSON.      The purest treasure mortal times afford,    Is--spotless reputation; that away,    Men are but gilded loam, or painted clay.    A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest    Is--a bold Spirit in a loyal breast.--SHAKSPEARE.    1. REPUTATION.--The two most precious things this side the grave are our  reputation and our life. But it is to be lamented that the most  contemptible whisper may deprive us of the one, and the weakest weapon of  the other. A wise man, therefore, will be more anxious to deserve a fair  name than to possess it, and this will teach him so to live, as not to be  afraid to die.    2. CHARACTER.--Character is one of the greatest motive powers in the world.  In its noblest embodiments, it exemplifies human nature in its highest  forms, for it exhibits man at his best.    3. THE HEART THAT RULES IN LIFE.--Although genius always commands  admiration, character most secures respect. The former is more the product  of brain power, the latter of heart power; and in the long run it is the  heart that rules in life. Men of genius stand to society in the relation of  its intellect as men of character of its conscience: and while the former  are admired, the latter are followed.    4. THE HIGHEST IDEAL OF LIFE AND CHARACTER.--Commonplace though it may  appear, this doing of one's duty embodies the highest ideal of life and  character. There may be nothing heroic about it; but the common lot of men  is not heroic. And though the abiding sense of duty upholds man in his  highest attitudes, it also equally sustains him in the transaction of the  ordinary affairs of every-day existence. Man's life is \"centered in the  sphere of common duties.\" The most influential of all the virtues are those  which are the most in request for daily use. They wear the best, and last  the longest.    5. WEALTH.--Wealth in the hands of men of weak purpose, or deficient  self-control, or of ill regulated passions, is {74} only a temptation and a  snare--the source, it may be, of infinite mischief to themselves, and often  to others.    On the contrary, a condition of comparative poverty is compatible with  character in its highest form. A man may possess only his industry, his  frugality, his integrity, and yet stand high in the rank of true manhood.  The advice which Burns' father gave him was the best:     \"He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing,    For without an honest, manly heart no man was worth regarding.\"    6. CHARACTER IS PROPERTY.--It is the noblest of possessions. It is an  estate in the general good-will and respect of men; they who invest in  it--though they may not become rich in this world's goods--will find their  reward in esteem and reputation fairly and honorably won. And it is right  that in life good qualities should tell--that industry, virtue, and  goodness should rank the highest--and that the really best men should be  foremost.    7. SIMPLE HONESTY OF PURPOSE.--This in a man goes a long way in life, if  founded on a just estimate of himself and a steady obedience to the rule he  knows and feels to be right. It holds a man straight, gives him strength  and sustenance, and forms a mainspring of vigorous action. No man is bound  to be rich or great--no, nor to be wise--but every man is bound to be  honest and virtuous.    [Illustration]    {76}    Family Government.    [Illustration: HEAVENLY MUSIC.]    1. GENTLENESS MUST CHARACTERIZE EVERY ACT OF AUTHORITY.--The storm of  excitement that may make the child start, bears no relation to actual  obedience. The inner firmness, that sees and feels a moral conviction and  expects obedience, is only disguised and defeated by bluster. The more calm  and direct it is, the greater certainty it has of dominion.    2. FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF SMALL CHILDREN.--For the government of small  children speak only in the authority of love, yet authority, loving and to  be obeyed. The most important lesson to impart is obedience to authority as  authority. The question of salvation with most children will be settled as  soon as they learn to obey parental authority. It establishes a habit and  order of mind that is ready to accept divine authority. This precludes  skepticism and disobedience, and induces that childlike trust and spirit  set forth as a necessary state of salvation. Children that are never made  to obey are left to drift into the sea of passion where the pressure for  surrender only tends to drive them at greater speed from the haven of  safety.    3. HABITS OF SELF-DENIAL.--Form in the child habits of self-denial.  Pampering never matures good character.    4. EMPHASIZE INTEGRITY.--Keep the moral tissues tough in integrity; then it  will hold a hook of obligations when once set in a sure place. There is  nothing more vital. Shape all your experiments to preserve the integrity.  Do not so reward it that it becomes mercenary. Turning State's evidence is  a dangerous experiment in morals. Prevent deceit from succeeding.    5. GUARD MODESTY.--To be brazen is to imperil some of the best elements of  character. Modesty may be strengthened into a becoming confidence, but  brazen facedness can seldom be toned down into decency. It requires the  miracle of grace.    6. PROTECT PURITY.--Teach your children to loathe impurity. Study the  character of their playmates. Watch their books. Keep them from corruption  at all cost. The groups of youth in the school and in society, and in  business places, seed with improprieties of word and thought. Never relax  your vigilance along this exposed border.    [Illustration: BOTH PUZZLED.]    7. THREATEN THE LEAST POSSIBLE.--In family government threaten the least  possible. Some parents rattle off their commands with penalties so  profusely that there is a steady {78} roar of hostilities about the child's  head. These threats are forgotten by the parent and unheeded by the child.  All government is at an end.    8. DO NOT ENFORCE TOO MANY COMMANDS.--Leave a few things within the range  of the child's knowledge that are not forbidden. Keep your word good, but  do not have too much of it out to be redeemed.    9. PUNISH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.--Sometimes punishment is necessary, but  the less it is resorted to the better.    10. NEVER PUNISH IN A PASSION.--Wrath only becomes cruelty. There is no  moral power in it. When you seem to be angry you can do no good.    11. BRUTISH VIOLENCE ONLY MULTIPLIES OFFENDERS.--Striking and beating the  body seldom reaches the soul. Fear and hatred beget rebellion.    12. PUNISH PRIVATELY.--Avoid punishments that break down self-respect.  Striking the body produces shame and indignation. It is enough for the  other children to know that discipline is being administered.    13. NEVER STOP SHORT OF SUCCESS.--When the child is not conquered the  punishment has been worse than wasted. Reach the point where neither wrath  nor sullenness remain. By firm persistency and persuasion require an open  look of recognition and peace. It is only evil to stir up the devil unless  he is cast out. Ordinarily one complete victory will last a child for a  lifetime. But if the child relapses, repeat the dose with proper  accompaniments.    14. DO NOT REQUIRE CHILDREN TO COMPLAIN OF THEMSELVES FOR PARDON.--It  begets either sycophants or liars. It is the part of the government to  detect offences. It reverses the order of matters to shirk this duty.    15. GRADE AUTHORITY UP TO LIBERTY.--The growing child must have experiments  of freedom. Lead him gently into the family. Counsel with him. Let him plan  as he can. By and by he has the confidence of courage without the danger of  exposures.    16. RESPECT.--Parents must respect each other. Undermining either  undermines both. Always govern in the spirit of love.    [Illustration]    {79}    CONVERSATION.        [Illustration]        Some men are very entertaining for a first interview, but after that      they are exhausted, and run out; on a second meeting we shall find them      very flat and monotonous; like hand-organs, we have heard all their      tunes.--COULTON.        He who sedulously attends, pointedly asks, calmly speaks, coolly      answers, and ceases when he has no more to say, is in possession of      some of the best requisites of man.--LAVATER.        Beauty is never so lovely as when adorned with the smile, and      conversation never sits easier upon us than when we know and then      discharge ourselves in a symphony of Laughter, which may not improperly      be called the Chorus of Conversation.--STEELE.
