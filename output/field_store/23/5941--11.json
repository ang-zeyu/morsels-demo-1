Large quantities of medicine given by pouring into the nose  are liable to strangle the animal, or, if the medicine is irritating, it  sets up an inflammation of the nose, fauces, windpipe, and sometimes the  lungs.    BY THE AIR PASSAGES.--Medicines are administered to the lungs and upper  air passages by insufflation, inhalation, injection, and nasal douche.    _Insufflation_ consists in blowing an impalpable powder directly into  the nose. It is but rarely resorted to.    _Inhalation._--Gaseous and volatile medicines are given by inhalation,  as is also medicated steam or vapor. Of the gases used there may be  mentioned, as the chief ones, sulphurous acid gas and, occasionally,  chlorin. The animal or animals are to be placed in a tight room, where  these gases are generated until the atmosphere is sufficiently  impregnated with them. Volatile medicines--as the anesthetics (ether,  chloroform, etc.)--are to be given by the attending surgeon only.  Medicated vapors are to be inhaled by placing a bucket containing hot  water, vinegar and water, scalded hay or bran, to which carbolic acid,  iodin, compound tincture of benzoin, or other medicines have been added,  in the bottom of a long grain bag. The horse's nose is to be inserted  into the top of the bag, and he thus inhales the \"medicated steam.\" Care  must be taken not to have it hot enough to scald the animal. The vapor  from scalding bran or hay is often thus inhaled to favor discharges in  sore throat or \"distemper.\"    _Injections_ are made into the trachea by means of a hypodermic syringe.  This method of medication is used for the purpose of treating local  diseases of the trachea and upper bronchial tubes. It has also been used  as a mode of administering remedies for their constitutional effect, but  is now rarely used for this purpose.    _The nasal douche_ is employed by the veterinarian in treating some  local diseases of the nasal chambers. Special appliances and  professional knowledge are necessary when using liquid medicines by this  method. It is not often resorted to, even by veterinary surgeons, since,  as a rule, the horse objects very strongly to this mode of medication.    BY THE SKIN.--Medicines are often administered to our hair-covered  animals by the skin, yet care must be taken in applying some  medicines--as tobacco water, carbolic-acid solutions, strong creolin  solutions, mercurial ointment, etc.--over the entire body, as poisoning  and death follow in some instances from absorption through the skin. For  the same reasons care must also be exercised and poisonous medicines not  applied over very large raw or abraded surfaces. With domestic animals  medicines are only to be applied by the skin to allay local pain or cure  local disease.    BY THE TISSUE BENEATH THE SKIN (HYPODERMATIC METHOD).--Medicines are  frequently given by the hypodermic syringe under the skin. It is not  safe for any but medical or veterinary practitioners to use this form of  medication, since the medicines thus given are powerful poisons. There  are many precautions to be observed, and a knowledge of anatomy is  indispensable. One of the chief precautions has to do with the  sterilization of the syringe. If it is not sterile an abscess may be  produced.    BY THE RECTUM.--Medicines may be given by the rectum when they can not  be given by the mouth, or when they are not retained in the stomach;  when we want a local action on the last gut; when it is desired to  destroy the small worms infesting the large bowels or to stimulate the  peristaltic motion of the intestines and cause evacuation. Medicines are  in such cases given in the form of suppositories or as liquid injections  (enemas.) Foods may also be given in this way.    _Suppositories_ are conical bodies made up of oil of theobroma and opium  (or whatever medicine is indicated in special cases), and are introduced  into the rectum or vagina to allay irritation and pain of these parts.  They are not much used in treating horses.    _Enemas_, when given for absorption, should be small in quantity,  neutral or slightly acid in reaction, and of a temperature of from 90 deg.  to 100 deg. F. These, like feeds given by the rectum, should be introduced  only after the last bowel has been emptied by the hand or by copious  injections of tepid water. Enemas, or clysters, if to aid the action of  physics, should be in quantities sufficient to distend the bowel and  cause the animal to eject them. Simple water, salt and water, or soap  and water, in quantities of a gallon or more, may be given every half  hour. It is best that the horse retain them for some little time, as the  liquid serves to moisten the dung and favors a passage. Stimulating  enemas, as glycerin, should be administered after those already  mentioned have emptied the last bowel, with the purpose of still further  increasing the natural motion of the intestines and aiding the purging  medicine.    Liquids may be thrown into the rectum by the means of a large syringe or  a pump. A very good \"irrigator\" can be bought of any tinsmith at a  trifling cost, and should be constantly at hand on every stock farm. It  consists of a funnel about 6 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter, which  is to be furnished with a prolongation to which a piece of rubber hose,  such as small garden hose, 4 feet long may be attached. The hose, well  oiled, is to be inserted gently into the rectum about 2 feet. The liquid  to be injected may then be poured in the funnel and the pressure of the  atmosphere will force it into the bowels. This appliance is better than  the more complicated and expensive ones.    Ordinary cold water or even ice-cold water is highly recommended by many  as a rectal injection for horses overcome by the excessive heat of  summer, and may be given by this simple pipe.    BY THE GENITO-URINARY PASSAGES.--This method of medication is especially  useful in treating local diseases of the genito-urinary organs. It finds  its chief application in the injection and cleansing of the uterus and  vagina. For this purpose a large syringe or the irrigator described  above may be used.    BY THE BLOOD.--Injections directly into veins are to be practiced by  medical or veterinary practitioners only, as are probably some other  means of giving medicines--intratracheal injections, etc.    [Illustration: PLATE III.

Mohler, V. M. D.]      It is not an easy task to write \"a plain account of the common diseases,  with directions for preventive measures, hygienic care, and the simpler  forms of medical treatment,\" of the digestive organs of the horse. Being  limited as to space, the endeavor has been made to give simply an  outline--to state the most important facts--leaving many gaps, and  continually checking the disposition to write anything like a full  description as to cause, prevention, and modes of treatment of diseases.      WATER.    It is generally held, at least in practice, that any water that stock  can be induced to drink is sufficiently pure for their use. This  practice occasions losses that would startle us if statistics were at  hand. Water that is impure from the presence of decomposing organic  matter, such as is found in wells and ponds in close proximity to manure  heaps and cesspools, is frequently the cause of diarrhea, dysentery, and  many other diseases of stock, while water that is impregnated with  different poisons and contaminated in very many instances with specific  media of contagion produces death.    Considering first the quantity of water required by the horse, it may be  stated that when our animals have access to water continually they never  drink to excess. Were the horse subjected to ship voyages or any other  circumstances where he must depend upon his attendant for the supply of  water, it may be roughly stated that he requires a daily average of  about 8 gallons of water. This varies somewhat upon the character of his  feed; if upon green feed, less water will be needed than when fed upon  dry hay and grain.    The time of giving water should be carefully studied. At rest, the horse  should receive it at least three times a day; when at work, more  frequently. The rule should be to give it in small quantities and often.  There is a popular fallacy that if a horse is warm he should not be  allowed to drink, many asserting that the first swallow of water  \"founders\" the animal or produces colic. This is erroneous. No matter  how warm a horse may be, it is always entirely safe to allow him from  six to ten swallows of water. If this is given on going into the  stable, he should have at once a pound or two of hay and allowed to rest  about an hour before feeding. If water is now offered him it will in  many cases be refused, or at least he will drink but sparingly. The  danger, then, is not in the \"first swallow\" of water, but is due to the  excessive quantity that the animal will take when warm if he is not  restrained.    Ice-cold water should never be given to horses. It may not be necessary  to add hot water, but we should be careful in placing water troughs  about our barns to have them in such position that the sun may shine  upon the water during the winter mornings. Water, even though it is thus  cold, seldom produces serious trouble if the horse has not been deprived  for a too great length of time.    In reference to the purity of water, Smith, in his \"Veterinary Hygiene,\"  classes spring water, deep-well water, and upland surface water as  wholesome; stored rain water and surface water from cultivated land"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

In those words,      Those little words, a kingdom and a king,      A line of thirteen ages, and the lives      Of thousands, and the fortune of all left      With life, are merged; and I, too, with the great,      Like a small bubble breaking with the wave      Which bore it, shall be nothing.
