I congratulate you, my boy, with all  my heart; and feel some satisfaction on my own account, for such an  action as this shows those who are inclined to grumble, at what  they may consider the favour shown to Scotchmen, that at any rate  the favour is not misplaced. A general order to the army has been  issued this morning saying that, some scoundrels, having disgraced  their uniform and brought discredit upon the army, by a murderous  and wicked attack upon the house of Count Eulenfurst, the king  reiterates and confirms his previous order that any man caught when  engaged in pillaging, or upon whose person any stolen goods are  found, will be summarily hung by the provost marshal, or by any  general officer before whom he may be brought.    \"The king himself has ridden to the count's chateau, this morning,  to make personal inquiries into his state, and to express his deep  regret at the outrage that has taken place. It is a politic action,  as well as a kind one. Of course, the event has occasioned great  excitement in the city.\"    \"And may I ask how the count is going on, sir?\"    \"The last report of the surgeons is a favourable one. He has partly  recovered consciousness, and at any rate recognizes his daughter,  who has divided her time between his bedside and her mother's. The  latter has fallen into a deep sleep of exhaustion; but will, I  doubt not, recover. The girl came down into the hall when the king  called. She bore herself well, they tell me, and would have  retained her composure, had it not been for the king himself. She  came down the grand staircase, with four of her maids behind  her--for a notice had been sent, half an hour before of his  coming--prepared, no doubt, to meet a stiff and haughty king; but  though Frederick can be every inch a king, when he chooses, there  is, as you know, no kinder-hearted man alive.    \"He went forward bare-headed to meet her and, as she stopped and  curtsied low, he took her two hands and said:    \"'My poor child, I am sorry, more sorry than I can tell you, for  what has happened; and hope with all my heart that your father,  whom all respect and honour, will not be taken from you. No doubt  you look upon me as an enemy; but although compelled to come here,  because your king is leagued with those who intend to destroy me  and my country, I bear no ill will to the people; and have given  the strictest orders that my soldiers shall, in all respects, treat  them as firm friends. But unfortunately, there are scoundrels  everywhere. These men have been punished as they deserved, and the  whole army will join with me in deep regret at what has happened,  and in the fervent hope that your father's life will be spared. I  grieve, too, to hear that the countess, your mother, has suffered  so greatly from the shock; and hope soon to be able to express to  her, in person, the regret I feel for what has taken place.'    \"The kindness of his tone, in saying all this, broke her down more  than the words of the king. He saw that she was unable to speak.    \"'There, there, child,' he said. 'I know what you are feeling, and  that you are longing to go upstairs again, so I will say goodbye.  Keep up a brave heart. The surgeons have every hope that your  father will recover. And believe that you will always have a friend  in Frederick of Prussia.'    \"He kissed her on the cheek, and then turned and left the hall,  followed by his staff.\"    Three days later the doctors were able to say confidently that,  unless some change occurred for the worse, they believed the count  would recover. On the fourth day, Fergus was sufficiently well to  mount his horse. The countess and her daughter had repeatedly asked  after him, and expressed their desire that he would come over, as  soon as he was well enough to do so.    One of the aides-de-camp had gone over, twice a day, to inquire as  to the progress the count was making. A guard had been placed at  the gate, and an officer stationed there to receive the names of  the stream of visitors from the city, and to inform them that the  count was making satisfactory progress. By the doctor's orders,  even the count's most intimate friends were refused admission, as  absolute quiet was needed.    Fergus dismounted at the gate, and walked up to the house. The maid  who opened the door recognized him at once.    \"Will you come in, sir?\" she said, with a beaming face. \"I will  tell the young countess you are here; and she will, I am sure, see  you.\"    A minute later, the girl ran down the stairs. As she came forward  she stopped, with sudden shyness. Absorbed in her anxiety for her  father and mother, she had taken but little heed of the appearance  of the officer who had saved them. That he was kind as well as  brave she was sure for, although he had scarce spoken to her, the  gentleness with which he had moved her father and her mother from  the bloodstained room, and the promptness and decision with which  he had given his orders, had inspired her with absolute confidence  in him. She had a vague idea that he was young, but his face,  flecked here and there with blood, had left but a faint impression  upon her memory; and when she saw the young officer, in his  spotless and imposing uniform, she almost felt that there must be  some mistake.    \"Are you Lieutenant Drummond, sir?\" she asked timidly.    \"I am, countess.\"    \"Was it really you who saved us, the other night?\"    \"I had that good fortune,\" he said with a smile.    She took the hand he held out, wonderingly, and then suddenly burst  into tears.    \"Oh, sir,\" she said, \"is it possible that you, who look so young,  can be the one who came to our assistance, and killed those six  evil men? It seems impossible.    \"I have been so unhappy, since. I did not know that you were  wounded until the maids told me, afterwards. I had never even  asked. I let you go, without one word of thanks for all that you  have done for us. What must you have thought of me?\"    \"I thought that you were a very courageous girl,\" Fergus said  earnestly; \"and that, after what you had gone through, the sight of  your father as you believed dying, and your mother in such a state,  you were wonderfully calm and composed. It would have been strange,  indeed, had you thought of anything else at such a time.\"    \"You are very good to say so, sir; but when I heard, from the  surgeons you sent, that you had fainted from loss of blood after  delivering your message, I felt that I should never forgive myself.  You had thought so much of us, and not of yourself. You had gone  about seeing to our comfort, and giving orders and arranging  everything, and all the time you yourself needed aid.\"    \"The wound was a mere trifle,\" he said, \"and I scarce gave it a  thought, myself, until I began to feel faint from loss of blood. I  can assure you that the thought that you were ungrateful has never  once entered my head.\"    \"And now, will you please come up to see my mother, sir. She will  be most anxiously expecting you.\"    They went upstairs together and, turning to the right on the top of  the stairs, entered a pretty apartment that was evidently the  countess's boudoir.    \"This is our preserver, mother,\" the girl said, as she entered.    The countess, who was advancing towards the door, stopped in  surprise. She had been able, from her daughter, to gain no idea of  the age of their rescuer; but the maids had all asserted that he  was quite young. As he was, for so the surgeons had told her, one  of Marshal Keith's aides-de-camp, she had pictured to herself a  fierce soldier; and the sight of this youth, with his smooth  pleasant face, surprised her, indeed.    \"Yes, mother, it is himself,\" the girl said. \"I was as surprised as  you are.\"    \"I have no words to thank you, sir, for the most inestimable  service which you have rendered us,\" the countess said warmly, as  she held out her hand. \"Assuredly my husband would have died, had  aid been delayed but a few minutes. As to my daughter and myself,  they would probably have killed us, to prevent our ever recognizing  or giving evidence against them. They only spared our lives, for a  time, in order to learn where our jewels were kept. This was but a  comparative trifle, though the jewels are precious, and there are  none more valuable in Saxony. I have no doubt that after stripping  the house of its valuables they would have buried them, intending  some day to recover them; and would then have fired the house, in  order to conceal all evidence of the crime that had been committed.  It seemed to me wonderful, before, that one man should, single  handed, have attacked and slain them; but now that I see you, it  seems almost a miracle that you performed in our favour.\"    \"It was no great feat, madam. I have the good fortune to be a fair  swordsman; and soldiers, although they may know their military  drill, have little chance with one who can use his weapon well.  Then, too, I had fortunately but three to deal with at a time; and  even then, I should not have come off victorious had it not been  for the courage of the maid, who ran boldly in, sprang on the back  of one, and threw him to the ground, while he was waiting to get a  steady aim at me with his pistol. I assuredly owe my life to her.\"    \"The King of Prussia left twenty gold crowns for her, when he was  here, saying that it was payment for saving the life of one of his  officers; and you may be sure that we shall not be ungrateful to  her. Your death would have involved that of my husband, and us. The  king also ordered that inquiry should be made as to whether our men  who were killed had families dependent upon them; and that if so,  pensions were to be given to these, as their loss had been  occasioned by the evil deeds of some of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#13)"],[1,". He, however, proved but a weak disciple, and on being urged by  his wife to be true to the old gods, he tried to effect a compromise and  worship Jehovah and Baal.    He was succeeded by his son Eorpwald, who was converted by missionaries  sent by Edwin king of Northumbria. His reign, however, was short, and at  his death the people again relapsed into heathenism.    Christianity was finally established among the East Angles by Sigeberht,  Eorpwald's brother, and it was due to him and through his influence that  Felix, a missionary from Burgundy, was enabled to fix his see at  Dunwich, A.D. 630.    #Felix# (630-47) must needs have been a man strong in his Faith; he  christianised the whole of that district which now includes Norfolk,  Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire. He died on the 8th of March, and was  canonized after death. Felixstowe, where he is said to have founded  schools, keeps his memory green in the East Country; but Dunwich, where  he fixed his see, has long since been covered by the encroaching waves.    Sigeberht resigned the crown to his kinsman Egric, and had entered a  monastery to finish his days in peace. But the kingdom was invaded by  the Mercians under Penda, and the peaceful old king was compelled to  appear in the field to give heart and courage to the East Angles. He,  however, declined to employ carnal weapons, and went out against his  enemies armed with nothing more formidable than a wand. He was killed  in the ensuing engagement, and his successor, Egric, shared the same  fate.    The administration of the two successors to Felix lasted twenty-two  years, from A.D. 647-69. The East Anglian see was then divided by  Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, into two separate administrations,  #Acci#, the fourth successor to Felix, taking Dunwich, while #Beadwin#  was consecrated to the see of Elham.    From this date there were two lines of East Anglian Bishops; ten  diocesans followed after Acci at Dunwich, and nine after Beadwin at  Elmham.    #St. Humbert# (828-78) was the last of the Bishops of Elmham; he crowned  St. Edmund king of the East Angles, and both were murdered by the Danes  under Hinguar in 870.    After Humbert's death the two sees were again united under #Wildred#,  who at this time was Bishop of Dunwich; he, however, preferred Humbert's  see at Elham, and removed there, and so the bishopric of Dunwich became  extinct.    During the next two hundred years (870-1070), there were thirteen  bishops of Elmham, and then Elmham shared a similar fate to Dunwich, and  the see was moved to Thetford by #Herfast#, a chaplain of William the  Conqueror. William of Malmesbury records that Herfast had decided to go  down to posterity as a man _who had done something_, and fixed on this  removal as an easy solution of the difficulty.    #William Galsagus# (1086-91) or de Beaufeu succeeded Herfast, and he in  turn was succeeded by Herbert de Losinga, who became first Bishop of  Norwich.    The history of #Herbert's# episcopate (1091-1119) is the history of the  causes which effected the building of Norwich Cathedral, and, although  given previously in the history of the fabric, must needs be briefly  recapitulated here. Herbert, if not of Norman birth, had received his  education in Normandy and was Prior of Fecamp--where he had first taken  his vows--when offered by William Rufus the appointment of Abbot of  Ramsey. The see of Thetford fell vacant, and Herbert procured his own  appointment from the Red King in consideration of a sum of L1900 which  he paid into the royal treasury. The remorse which followed on this sin  of simony compelled him to go to Rome and seek the consolation and  forgiveness of Pope Urban. This was in 1094. He returned, and as  expiation for his sin founded the Priory of Norwich, the first stone of  which was laid in 1096, the see being removed from Thetford in  accordance with the decree of Lanfranc's Synod, held in 1075, that all  bishops should fix their sees in the principal town in their dioceses.    In cathedral monasteries the bishop, who was elected by the monks,  appears to have represented the abbot and took precedence of the prior.  Before Herbert's time, the chapter was composed of secular canons and  not monks.    Herbert, in 1101, placed sixty monks at Norwich, and it may be of  interest to quote from Taylor's \"_Index Monasticus_\" the establishment  of the monastery from Herbert's time up to the dissolution in 1538--        The Bishop representing the              Chaplains.        Abbot.                                 Precentor or chanter.      The Lord Prior.                          Sub-chanter.      The Sub-Prior.                           Infirmarer.      60 Monks.                                Choristers.      Sacrist.                                 Keeper of the Shrines.      Sub-sacrist.                             Lay Officers.      Cellarer or bursar.                      Butlers.      Camerarius or chamberlain.               Granarii.      Almoner.                                 Hostilarii.      Refectorer.                              Carcerarius or gaoler.      Pittancier.    Archbishop Anselm had refused to acknowledge that the king had the right  to exercise a suzerainty over the Church, and declined to consent to lay  investitures. An embassy was sent to Rome, and Herbert, who went there a  second time about 1116, represented the king. It, however, was in no way  satisfactory; the Pope did not want to offend the king, and he wished to  retain to himself the right of investiture, so, while congratulating the  Archbishop's representatives, he sympathised also with those of the  king. The exertion told on Herbert, and at Placentia, on the return  journey, he fell sick, and stopped there until he became sufficiently  convalescent to journey by short and easy stages to his own cathedral  city. He lived to complete much important business, but his days of  administration were drawing to a close. He had been Prior of Fecamp,  Abbot of Ramsey, Sewer to William Rufus, had governed the East Anglian  bishopric first from the episcopal see at Thetford, had transferred it  to Norwich, and founded the Cathedral Priory, and if this were not  sufficient, he founded and endowed many other churches and monasteries  in the East Country. His repentance had been sincere, and in one of his  letters he refers to \"my past life, which, alas! is darkened by many  foul sins.\" Dean Goulburn credits him with a third journey to Rome, and  says that it was at Placentia, on the outward journey, that he  contracted so grievous a sickness that he \"lay ten successive days  without taking food and without uttering a word\"; in fact, never  reaching Rome, but waiting for and rejoining his brother ambassadors on  their return. This journey was undertaken with the view of adjusting the  differences that had arisen between the new Primates, Ralph and  Thurston. The embassy was not successful, the Pope declining to commit  himself to any but the most general statements.    One of the last public acts of Herbert's life was to attend the funeral  of Queen Matilda on May-day, 1118. He died on the 22nd of July 1119 in  the twenty-seventh year of his episcopate, and was buried before the  high altar of his cathedral church.    #Eborard# (1121-1145), who succeeded Herbert, a son by second marriage  of Roger de Montgomery, first Earl of Arundel, was consecrated in 1121.    During his episcopate Eborard had parted with the towns of Blickling and  Cressingham, which pertained to his see, to two of the more powerful  barons, in the hope of securing the rest of the episcopal property, and  possibly with the idea of regaining possession of the same when the  troubled times should have passed.    He was deposed in 1145, and it may possibly be that he had favoured the  cause of Maude in the civil wars of the period, and that it was Stephen  who compelled him to relinquish his see and spend the rest of his life  in exile. He had in 1139 laid the foundation of an abbey at Fontenay, in  the south of France, and thither he repaired. He died in 1149.    His successor, #William de Turbe# (1146-1174), was elected to the see,  and in the year 1146 was consecrated at Canterbury by Archbishop  Theobald.    In 1168, Becket had written to De Turbe from Vezelay, a town on the  borders of Burgundy and Nivernois, and ordered him, by the Pope's  authority, to publicly excommunicate Hugh Bigot, Earl of Norfolk. He had  robbed the Priory of Pentnay, in Norfolk, of some of its possessions. De  Turbe obeyed, notwithstanding the fact that the king had sent officers  to prohibit him from so doing. An absolution was obtained from the Pope,  but the king was so far incensed that De Turbe considered it advisable  to rest in sanctuary at Norwich until the following year, 1169, when he  received the royal pardon.    [Illustration: Norwich Castle.]    Bishop William de Turbe died 17th January 1174, and was buried in the  cathedral choir, on the left side of the founder.    #John of Oxford# (1175-1200) was consecrated at Lambeth by Richard,  Archbishop of Canterbury, December 14, 1175; he was clerk or royal  chaplain to the king. He had presided over the council of Clarendon, the  constitutions of which defined the king's prerogatives in regard to the  Church, and chiefly with regard to the question of trying clerks charged  with crimes in the civil courts. He was despatched to Rome on an embassy  to the Pope, Alexander III., and on its failure was sent by Henry to  the Diet at Wurzburg; the king, not having been supported by Alexander,  determined to uphold his opponent, and as well he, in direct opposition  to the Pope, made John of Oxford Dean of Salisbury, with the result that  the future Bishop of Norwich incurred the penalty of excommunication by  Becket from Vezelay, \"for having fallen into a damnable heresy in taking  a sacrilegious oath to the emperor, for having communicated with the  schismatic of"]]]
