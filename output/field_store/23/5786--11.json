He will keep you _au courant_, at the same time, tell the name of every  settler and settlement, and some good stories to boot. He is a capital  fellow, is \"Paddy the driver,\" generally a small farmer, and always has  a contract with the commissariat.    The first place of any note we came to, as day broke out of the blue fog  which rose from the swampy forest, was Holland River Bridge, an  extraordinary structure, half bridge, half road, over a swamp created by  that river in times long gone by; a level tract of marsh and wild rice  as far as the eye can reach, full of ducks and deer, with the Holland  River in the midst, winding about like a serpentine canal, and looking  as if it had been fast asleep since its last shake of the ague.    Crossing this bridge-road, now in good order, but in 1837 requiring  great dexterity and agility to pass, you come to a slight elevation of  the land, and a little village in West Gwillimbury, which, I should  think, is a capital place to catch lake-fever in.    The road to it is good, but, after passing it and turning northwards,  is but little improved, being very primitive through the township of  Innisfil. However, we jogged along in mist and rain, on the 29th of  June, and saw the smoke, ay, and smelt it too, of numerous clearings or  forest burnings, indicating settlement, till we reached Wilson's Tavern,  where, every body having the ague, it was somewhat difficult to get  breakfast. This is thirteen miles from St. Alban's.    Having refreshed, however, with such as it was, we visited Mr. Wilson's  stable, and saw a splendid stud horse which he was rearing, and as  handsome a thorough-bred black as you could wish to see in the  backwoods.    Proceeding in rain, we drove, by what in England would be called an  execrable road, through the townships of Innisfil and Vespra to Barrie,  the capital hamlet of the district of Simcoe.    On emerging from the woods three or four miles from Barrie, Kempenfeldt  Bay suddenly appears before you, and if the road was better, a more  beautiful ride there is not in all broad Canada. Fancy, however, that,  without any Hibernicism, the best road is in the water of the lake. This  is owing to the swampy nature of the land, and to the circumstance that  a belt of hard sand lines the edge of the bay; so Paddy drove smack into  the water of Kempenfeldt, and, as he said, sure we were travelling by  water every way, for we had a deluge of rain above, and Lake Simcoe  under us.    But natheless we arrived at Barrie by mid-day, a very fair journey of  twenty-eight miles in eight hours, over roads, as the French say,  _inconcevable_; and alighted like river gods at the Queen's Arms, J.  Bingham, Barrie.    Barrie, named after the late commodore, Sir Robert Barrie, is no common  village, nor is the Queen's Arms a common hostel. It is a good,  substantial, stone edifice, fitted up and kept in a style which neither  Toronto nor Kingston, nay, nor Montreal can rival, as far as its extent  goes. I do assure you, it is a perfect paradise after the road from St.  Alban's; and, as the culinary department is unexceptionable, and the  beds free from bugs, and all neatness and no noise, I will award Mrs.  Bingham a place in these pages, which must of course immortalize her.  They are English people; and, when I last visited their house, in 1837,  had only a log-hut: now they are well to do, and have built themselves a  neat country-house.    When I first saw Barrie, or rather before Barrie was, as I passed over  its present site, in 1831, there was but one building and a little  clearance. In 1846, it is fast approaching to be a town, and will be a  city, as it is admirably placed at the bottom of an immense inlet of  Lake Simcoe, with every capability of opening a communication with the  new settlements of Owen Sound and St. Vincent, and the south shore of  Lake Huron.    It has been objected, to this opinion respecting Barrie, that the  Narrows of Lake Simcoe is the proper site for \"The City of the North,\"  as the communication by land, instead of being thirty-six miles to  Penetanguishene, the best harbour on Lake Huron, is only fourteen, or  at most nineteen miles, the former taking to Cold Water Creek, and the  latter to Sturgeon Bay; but then there is a long and somewhat dangerous  transit in the shallowest part of the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron to  Penetanguishene.    If a railroad was established between Barrie and the naval station, this  would be not only the shortest but the safest route to Lake Huron; for,  if Sturgeon Bay is chosen, in war-time the transit trade and the  despatch of stores for the government would be subjected to continual  hindrance and depredation from the multitude of islands and  hiding-places between Sturgeon Bay and Penetanguishene; whilst, on the  other hand, no sagacious enemy would penetrate the country from Sturgeon  Bay and leave such a stronghold as Penetanguishene in his rear, whereby  all his vessels and supplies might be suddenly cut off, and his return  rendered impracticable.    Barrie is, therefore, well chosen, both as a transit town and as the  site of naval operations on Lake Simcoe, whenever they may be  necessary.    For this reason, government commenced the military road between Barrie  and Penetanguishene, and settled it with pensioned soldiers, and also  settled naval and military retired or half-pay officers all round Lake  Simcoe. But, as we shall have to talk a good deal about this part of the  country, and I must return by the road, let us hasten on to our night's  lodging at the Ordnance Arms, kept by the ancient widow of J. Bruce, an  old artilleryman.    Since 1837, the road, then impassable for anything but horses or very  small light waggons, has been much improved, and Paddy drove us on,  after dinner at Bingham's, through the heavy rain _a merveille_!    When I passed this road before, what a road it was! or, in the words of  the eulogist of the great Highland road-maker, General Wade,      \"Had you seen this road, before it was made,    You would have lift up your eyes and blessed\"         General somebody.    It was necessary, as late as 1837, to take a horse; and, placing your  valise on another, mount the second with a guide. My guide was always a  French Canadian named Francois; and many an adventure in the  interminable forest have we experienced together; for if Francois had  lost his way, we should have perhaps reached the Copper-mine River, or  the Northern Frozen Ocean, and have solved the question of the passage  from the Atlantic to the Pacific, or else we should have had a certain  convocation of politic wolves or bears, busy in rendering us and our  horses invisible; for, after all, they have the true receipt of fern  seed, and you can walk about, after having suffered transmigration into  their substance, without its ever being suspected that you were either  an officer of engineers or a Franco-Canadian guide.    An old and respected officer, once travelling this bridle road with  Francois and myself, and mounted on a better horse than either of ours,  which was lent to him by the Assistant Commissary-General stationed at  Penetanguishene, got ahead of us considerably, and, by some accident,  wandered into the gloomy pine forest. Missing him for a quarter of an  hour, I rode as fast as my horse, which was not encumbered with baggage,  would go ahead, and, observing fresh tracks of a horse's shoes in the  mud, followed them until I heard in the depths of the endless and solemn  woods faint shouts, which, as I came nearer to them, resolved themselves  into the syllables of my name. I found my chief, and begged him never  again, as he had never been there before, to think of leaving us. Had he  gone out of sound, his fate would have been sealed, unless the horse,  used as it was to the path, had wandered into it again; but horses and  cattle are frequently lost in these solitudes, and, perhaps being  frightened by the smell of the wild beasts, or, as man always does when  lost, they wander in a circle, and thus frequently come near the place  from which they started, but not sufficiently so to hit the almost  invisible path.    But although the road, excepting in the middle of summer, is still  indifferent, it is perfectly safe, and a lady may now go to  Penetanguishene comparatively comfortably.    Bruce's tavern is a respectable log-house, twelve miles from Barrie; and  here you can get the usual fare of ham, eggs, and chickens, with  occasionally fresh meat from Barrie, and perhaps as good a bed as can be  had in Canada. We started from Barrie at half-past two, and arrived at  half-past five.    Whiskey, be it known, with very atrocious brandy, is the only beverage,  excepting water, along the country roads of Canada.    From Bruce's we drove to Dawson's, also kept by the widow of an old  soldier, where every thing is equally clean, respectable, and  comfortable. It is seven miles distant.    Beyond this is Nicoll's, near a corduroy swamp road; and three miles  further (which place eschew), seven years ago, I heard the landlady's  voice chiding a little girl, who had been sent a quarter of a mile for a  jug of water. I heard the same voice again in action, and for the same  cause, and a very dirty urchin again brought some very dirty water. In  fact, whiskey was too plentiful and water too scarce.    From Nicoll's to Jeff's Corner is ten long and weary miles, five or six  of which are through the forest. Jeff's is not a tavern, so that you  must go to bait the horses to Des Hommes, about two miles further, where  there is no inducement to stay, it being kept by an old French Canadian,  who has a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#13)"],[1,"_ante_, p. 15.

I  am much obliged to you, dear Uncle, for the extract about Queen Anne,  but must beg you, as you have sent me to show what a Queen _ought not_  to be, that you will send me what a Queen _ought to be_.[18]    Might I ask what is the very pretty seal with which the letter I got  from you yesterday was closed? It is so peculiar that I am anxious to  know.    Believe me always, dear Uncle, your very affectionate, very dutiful,  and very attached Niece,    VICTORIA.

Sure enough, when I show  you what a Queen ought not to be, I also ought to tell you what she  should be, and this task I will very conscientiously take upon myself  on the very first occasion which may offer itself for a confidential  communication. Now I must conclude, to go to town. I must, however,  say that I have given orders to send you Sully's Memoirs. As they have  not been written exclusively for young ladies, it will be well to have  Lehzen to read it with you, and to judge what ought to be left for  some future time. And now God bless you! Ever, my beloved child, your  attached Friend and Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.          [Pageheading: A NEW YEAR GREETING]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    ST. LEONARDS, _28th December 1834._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I must again, with your permission, write you a few  lines, to wish you a very happy new year, not only for _this_ year,  but for _many_ to come. I know not how to thank you sufficiently for  the _invaluable_ and precious autographs which you were so very kind  as to send me. Some of them I received a few days ago, and the others  to-day, accompanied by a very kind letter from you, and a beautiful  shawl, which will be most useful to me, particularly as a favourite  one of mine is growing very old. I wish you could come here, for  many reasons, but also to be an eye-witness of my extreme prudence in  eating, which would astonish you. The poor sea-gulls are, however,  not so happy as you imagine, for they have great enemies in the  country-people here, who take pleasure in shooting them.    Believe me always, my dearest Uncle, your very affectionate and most  grateful Niece,    VICTORIA.          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    KENSINGTON PALACE, _2nd February 1835._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I know not how to thank you sufficiently for  the most valuable autographs you were kind enough to send me. I am  particularly delighted with that of Louis Quatorze, \"le grand Roi,\"  and my great admiration.... You will not, I hope, think me very  troublesome if I venture to ask for two more autographs which I should  very particularly like to have; they are Mme. de Sevigne's[19] and  Racine's; as I am reading the letters of the former, and the tragedies  of the latter, I should prize them highly. Believe me always, my  dearest Uncle, your most affectionate and dutiful Niece,    VICTORIA.        [Footnote 19: Marie de Rabutin Chantal, Marquise de Sevigne,      born 1626.

I am perhaps rather strangely situated for a  preaching--somewhat in the style of those old camp preachers who held  forth to many thousand people on some heath in Scotland. I am also  on an immense heath, surrounded by 16,000 men, mostly young and  gay, cooking, singing, working, and not very like the stern old  Covenanters; however, I shall try. First of all, let me congratulate  you that it passed happily and well off. Secondly, let me entreat you  to look with a serious and reflective mind on the day which is past.  Many are the religions, many the shades of those religions, but it  must be confessed the principles of the Christian religion are the  most perfect and the most beautiful that can be imagined.... There is  one virtue which is particularly Christian; this is the knowledge of  our own heart in _real humility_. _Hypocrisy_ is a besetting sin of  all times, but _particularly of the present_, and many are the wolves  in sheep's clothes. I am sorry to say, with all my affection for old  England, the very _state of its Society and politics_ renders many in  that country _essentially humbugs and deceivers_; the _appearance_ of  the thing is generally _more_ considered than the _reality_; provided  matters go off well, and opinion may be gained, the _real good is  matter of the most perfect indifference_. Defend yourself, my dear  love, against this system; let your dear character always be true  and loyal; this does not _exclude prudence_--worldly concerns are  now unfortunately so organised that you _must be cautious_ or you may  injure yourself and others--but it does not prevent the being sterling  and true. Nothing in persons gives greater reliance, greater weight,  than when they are known to be _true_. From your earliest childhood  I was anxious to see in you this important virtue _saved_ and  _developed_, and Lehzen will still be able to recollect that. If it is  God's pleasure that you should once[21] fill the arduous situation to  which you seem destined, you will find the importance of what I now  say to you. And when others may tremble to have at last their real  character found out, and to meet all the contempt which they may  deserve, your mind and heart will be still and happy, because it will  know that it acts honestly, that truth and goodness are the motives of  its actions. I press you now against my heart; may God bless you as  I wish and hope it, and may you always feel some affection for your  sincerely devoted camp preacher and Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.        [Footnote 20: The Princess was confirmed at the Chapel Royal,      on 30th July 1835.]        [Footnote 21: King Leopold not infrequently uses \"once\" like      the Latin _olim_, as referring to any indefinite date in the      future as well as in the past. \"Some day\" is what is intended      here.]          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    TO CHAPTER V      THE year 1836 was not an eventful one at home; the Whig Ministry were  too weak to carry measures of first-rate importance, and could hardly  have maintained themselves in power against the formidable opposition  of Sir Robert Peel without the support of O'Connell. Parliament was  chiefly occupied by the consideration of the Secret Societies in  Ireland, Tithes, Municipal Corporations, and such matters; the  Marriage Act, and the Act for the Registration of Births have probably  been the most important measures of the year to the country. Troubles  which were destined to become more acute arose in Lower Canada and  Jamaica, both taking the form of disputes between the executive and  the legislature.    On the continent of Europe, affairs were more disturbing. Several  attempts were made on the life of the King of the French, while an  abortive insurrection with a view of establishing a military empire  was made by Louis Bonaparte at Strasburg. The Prince was allowed to  leave the country and go to the United States, but his accomplices  were detained for trial. In Algiers the French Government determined  to prosecute operations against the Arab Chief Abd-el-Kader, and they  sent an expedition to Constantin.    Holland and Belgium were occupied with a dispute about their boundary  line, the cession to Belgium of Luxemburg being the chief point  of difference. The difficulties that arose in passing an important  Municipal Act for Belgium caused King Leopold temporarily to regret he  had not accepted the throne of Greece.    Portugal was still convulsed by revolutionary agitation. Dom Pedro,  the eldest son of King John VI., had been proclaimed Emperor of Brazil  in his father's lifetime, and had abdicated the throne of Portugal in  favour of his daughter Donna Maria, a child seven years old, while Dom  Miguel, his younger brother, who had acted in opposition to his father  in Portugal, claimed the throne for himself. Dom Pedro had agreed that  his daughter should marry Miguel, who was in 1827 appointed Regent.  Miguel, had he acted wisely, might have maintained"]]]
