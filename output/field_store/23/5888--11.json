As the little fellow went on his way nearly all the fairies followed him  to the borders of the land, and when they saw him go up the mountain  towards the land of the giants, they all took off their little red caps  and waved them until he was out of sight.    On he went walking all day and night, and when the sun rose on the  morrow he was on the top of the mountain, and he could see the land of  the giants in the valley stretched far below him. Before beginning his  descent he turned round for a last glimpse of fairyland; but he could  see nothing, for a thick, dark cloud shut it out from view. He was  very sad, and tired, and footsore, and as he struggled down the rough  mountain side, he could not help thinking of the soft, green woods and  mossy pathways of the pleasant land he had left behind him.    [Illustration: \"He was very sad, and tired\"]    When he awoke the ground was trembling, and a noise that sounded like  thunder fell on his ears. He looked up and saw coming towards him a  terrible giant, with one eye that burned like a live coal in the middle  of his forehead; his mouth stretched from ear to ear, his teeth were  long and crooked, the skin of his face was as black as night, and his  arms and chest were all covered with black, shaggy hair; round his body  was an iron band, and hanging from this by a chain was a great club with  iron spikes. With one blow of this club he could break a rock into  splinters, and fire could not burn him, and water could not drown him,  and weapons could not wound him, and there was no way to kill him but  by giving him three blows of his own club. And he was so bad-tempered  that the other giants called him Sharvan the Surly. When the giant spied  the red cap of the little fairy he gave the shout that sounded like  thunder. The poor fairy was shaking from head to foot.    \"What brought you here?\" said the giant.    \"Please, Mr. Giant,\" said the fairy, \"the king of the fairies banished  me here, and here I must stay for ever and a day, unless you come and  guard the fairy tree in Dooros Wood.\"    \"Unless what?\" roared the giant, and he gave the fairy a touch of his  foot that sent the little fellow rolling down head over heels.    The poor fairy lay as if he were dead, and then the giant, feeling sorry  for what he had done, took him up gently between his finger and thumb.    \"Don't be frightened, little man,\" said he, \"and now, tell me all about  the tree.\"    \"It is the tree of the fairy berry that grows in the Wood of Dooros,\"  said the fairy, \"and I have some of the berries with me.\"    \"Oh, you have, have you?\" said the giant. \"Let me see them.\"    The fairy took three berries from the pocket of his little green coat,  and gave them to the giant.    The giant looked at them for a second. He then swallowed the three  together, and when he had done so, he felt so happy that he began to  shout and dance for joy.    \"More, you little thief!\" said he. \"More, you little----what's your  name?\" said the giant.    \"Pinkeen, please, Mr. Giant,\" said the fairy, as he gave up all the  berries.    The giant shouted louder than before, and his shouts were heard by all  the other giants, who came running towards him.    When Sharvan saw them coming, he caught up Pinkeen, and put him in his  pocket, that they shouldn't see him.    \"What were you shouting for?\" said the giants.    \"Because,\" said Sharvan, \"that rock there fell down on my big toe.\"    \"You did not shout like a man that was hurt,\" said they.    \"What is it to you what way I shouted?\" said he.    \"You might give a civil answer to a civil question,\" said they; \"but  sure you were always Sharvan the Surly;\" and they went away.    When the giants were out of sight, Sharvan took Pinkeen out of his  wallet.    \"Some more berries, you little thief--I mean little Pinkeen,\" said he.    \"I have not any more,\" said Pinkeen; \"but if you will guard the tree in  Dooros Wood you can feast on them from morn till night.\"    \"I'll guard every tree in the wood, if I may do that,\" said the giant.    \"You'll have to guard only one,\" said Pinkeen.    \"How am I to get to it?\" said Sharvan.    \"You must first come with me towards fairyland,\" said the fairy.    \"Very well,\" said Sharvan; \"let us go.\" And he took up the fairy and put  him into his wallet, and before very long they were on the top of the  mountain. Then the giant looked around towards the giants' land; but  a black cloud shut it out from view, while the sun was shining on the  valley that lay before him, and he could see away in the distance the  green woods and shining waters of fairyland.    It was not long until he reached its borders, but when he tried to cross  them his feet stuck to the ground and he could not move a step. Sharvan  gave three loud shouts that were heard all over fairyland, and made the  trees in the woods tremble, as if the wind of a storm was sweeping over  them.    \"Oh, please, Mr. Giant, let me out,\" said Pinkeen. Sharvan took out the  little fellow, who, as soon as he saw he was on the borders of fairyland  ran as fast as his legs could carry him, and before he had gone very far  he met all the little fairies who, hearing the shouts of the giant, came  trooping out from the ferns to see what was the matter. Pinkeen told  them it was the giant who was to guard the tree, shouting because he  was stuck fast on the borders, and they need have no fear of him. The  fairies were so delighted to have Pinkeen back again, that they took  him up on their shoulders and carried him to the king's palace, and all  the harpers and pipers and fiddlers marched before him playing the most  jocund music that was ever heard. The king and queen were on the lawn  in front of the palace when the gay procession came up and halted before  them. The queen's eyes glistened with pleasure when she saw the little  favorite, and the king was also glad at heart, but he looked very grave  as he said:    \"Why have you returned, sirrah?\"    Then Pinkeen told his majesty that he had brought with him a giant who  was willing to guard the fairy tree.    \"And who is he and where is he?\" asked the king.    \"The other giants called him Sharvan the Surly,\" said Pinkeen, \"and he  is stuck fast outside the borders of fairyland.\"    \"It is well,\" said the king, \"you are pardoned.\"    When the fairies heard this they tossed their little red caps in the  air, and cheered so loudly that a bee who was clinging to a rose-bud  fell senseless to the ground.    Then the king ordered one of his pages to take a handful of berries,  and to go to Sharvan and show him the way to Dooros Wood. The page,  taking the berries with him, went off to Sharvan, whose roaring nearly  frightened the poor little fellow to death. But as soon as the giant  tasted the berries he got into good humor, and he asked the page if he  could remove the spell of enchantment from him.    \"I can,\" said the page, \"and I will if you promise me that you will not  try to cross the borders of fairyland.\"    \"I promise that, with all my heart,\" said the giant. \"But hurry on, my  little man, for there are pins and needles in my legs.\"    The page plucked a cowslip, and picking out the five little crimson  spots in the cup of it, he flung one to the north, and one to the south,  and one to the east, and one to the west, and one up into the sky, and  the spell was broken, and the giant's limbs were free. Then Sharvan  and the fairy page set off for Dooros Wood, and it was not long until  they came within view of the fairy tree. When Sharvan saw the berries  glistening in the sun, he gave a shout so loud and strong that the wind  of it blew the little fairy back to fairyland. But he had to return to  the wood to tell the giant that he was to stay all day at the foot of  the tree ready to do battle with anyone who might come to steal the  berries, and that during the night he was to sleep amongst the branches.    \"All right,\" said the giant, who could scarcely speak, as his mouth was  full of berries.    Well, the fame of the fairy-tree spread far and wide, and every day some  adventurer came to try if he could carry away some of the berries; but  the giant, true to his word, was always on the watch, and not a single  day passed on which he did not fight and slay a daring champion, and the  giant never received a wound, for fire could not burn him, nor water  drown him, nor weapon wound him.    Now, at this time, when Sharvan was keeping watch and ward over the  tree, a cruel king was reigning over the lands that looked towards  the rising sun. He had slain the rightful king by foul means, and his  subjects, loving their murdered sovereign, hated the usurper; but much  as they hated him they feared him more, for he was brave and masterful,  and he was armed with a helmet and shield which no weapon made by mortal  hands could pierce, and he carried always with him two javelins that  never missed their mark, and were so fatal that they were called \"the  shafts of death.\" The murdered king had two children--a boy, whose name  was Niall, and a girl, who was called Rosaleen--that is, little Rose;  but no rose that ever bloomed was half as sweet or fresh or fair as she.  Cruel as the tyrant king was, he was too afraid of the people to kill  the children. He sent the boy adrift on the sea in an open boat, hoping  the waves would swallow it; and he got an old witch to cast the spell of  deformity over Rosaleen, and under the spell her beauty faded, until at  last she became so ugly and wasted that scarcely anyone would speak to  her. And, shunned by everyone, she spent her days in the out-houses with  the cattle, and every night she cried herself to sleep.    One day, when she was very lonely, a little robin came to pick the  crumbs that had fallen about her feet. He appeared so tame that she  offered him the bread from her hand, and when he took it she cried with  joy at finding that there was one living "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#13)"],[1,"actually gave chase to a ship that  carried a Turkish ambassador, no apologies that the Signoria offered  could wipe out the affront. War was inevitable, and Venice hastily  made common cause with the Pope and the Emperor against the formidable  host which now advanced upon the Adriatic.    Before this, some stirring actions had been fought off the coasts of  Greece. Doria, sallying forth from Messina, had met the governor of  Gallipoli off Paxos, and had fought him before daybreak. Standing  erect on the poop, conspicuous in his cramoisy doublet, the tall  figure of the old admiral was seen for an hour and a half directing  the conflict, sword in hand, an easy mark for sharpshooters, as a  wound in the knee reminded him. After a severe struggle the twelve  galleys of the enemy were captured and carried in triumph to Messina.  Barbarossa was sorely wanted now, and in May, 1537, he sailed with one  hundred and thirty-five galleys to avenge the insult. For a whole  month he laid waste the Apulian coast like a pestilence, and carried  off ten thousand slaves, while Doria lay helpless with a far inferior  force in Messina roads. The Turks were boasting that they might soon  set up a Pope of their own, when the war with Venice broke out, and  they were called off from their devastation of Italy by the Sultan's  command to besiege Corfu. The Ionian islands were always a bone of  contention between the Turks and their neighbours, and a war with  Venice naturally began with an attack upon Corfu. The Senate had shut  its eyes as long as possible to the destination of the huge armaments  which had left Constantinople in the spring: Tunis, or perhaps Naples,  was said to be their object. But now they were undeceived, and on the  25th of August, Captain Pasha Barbarossa landed twenty-five thousand  men and thirty cannon under Lutfi Pasha, three miles from the castle  of Corfu. Four days later the Grand Vez[=i]r Ay[=a]s, with twenty-five  thousand more and a brilliant staff, joined the first-comers, and the  Akinji or light troops spread fire and sword around. A fifty-pounder  fired nineteen shots in three days, but only five struck the fortress:  the Turks fired too high, and many of their missiles fell harmlessly  into the sea beyond. In spite of storm and rain the Grand Vez[=i]r  would not desist from making the round of the trenches by night.  Suleym[=a]n offered liberal terms of capitulation, but the besieged  sent back his messenger with never an answer. Alexandro Tron worked  the big guns of the castle with terrible precision. Two galleys were  quickly sunk, four men were killed in the trenches by a single shot--a  new and alarming experience in those early days of gunnery--four times  the Fort of St. Angelo was attacked in vain; winter was approaching,  and the Sultan determined to raise the siege. In vain Barbarossa  remonstrated: \"A thousand such castles were not worth the life of one  of his brave men,\" said the Sultan, and on the 17th of September the  troops began to re-embark.[34]    Then began a scene of devastation such as the isles of Greece have too  often witnessed,--not from Turks only, but from Genoese and Venetians,  who also came to the Archipelago for their oarsmen,--but never perhaps  on so vast a scale. Butrinto was burnt, Paxos conquered, and then  Barbarossa carried fire and sword throughout the Adriatic and the  Archipelago. With seventy galleys and thirty galleots, he raged among  the islands, most of which belonged to noble families of Venice--the  Venieri, Grispi, Pisani, Quirini. Syra, Skyros, Aegina, Paros, Naxos,  Tenos, and other Venetian possessions were overwhelmed, and thousands  of their people carried off to pull a Turkish oar. Naxos contributed  five thousand dollars as her first year's tribute; Aegina furnished  six thousand slaves. Many trophies did Barbarossa bring home to  Stambol, whose riches certainly did his own and the Sultan's, if not  \"the general coffer, fill.\" Four hundred thousand pieces of gold, a  thousand girls, and fifteen hundred boys, were useful resources when  he returned to \"rub his countenance against the royal stirrup.\"[35]  Two hundred boys in scarlet, bearing gold and silver bowls; thirty  more laden with purses; two hundred with rolls of fine cloth: such was  the present with which the High Admiral approached the Sultan's  presence.    Suleym[=a]n's genius was at that time bent upon three distinct  efforts: he was carrying on a campaign in Moldavia; his Suez fleet--a  novelty in Ottoman history--was invading the Indian Ocean, with no  very tangible result, it is true (unless a trophy of Indian ears and  noses may count), save the conquest of Aden on the return voyage, but  still a notable exploit, and disturbing to the Portuguese in Gujerat;  and his High Admiral was planning the destruction of the maritime  power of Venice.    In the summer of 1538, Barbarossa put off to sea, and soon had one  hundred and fifty sail under his command. He began by collecting  rowers and tribute from the islands, twenty-five of which had now been  transferred from the Venetian to the Turkish allegiance, and then laid  waste eighty villages in Candia. Here news was brought that the united  fleet of the Emperor, Venice, and the Pope was cruising in the  Adriatic, and the Captain Pasha hastened to meet it. The pick of the  Corsairs was with him. Round his flagship were ranged the galleys of  Dragut, Mur[=a]d Reis, Sin[=a]n, S[=a]lih Reis with twenty Egyptian  vessels, and others, to the number of one hundred and twenty-two  ships of war. The advance guard sighted part of the enemy off  Prevesa--a Turkish fortress opposite the promontory of Arta or Actium,  where Antony suffered his memorable defeat.    [Illustration: COMPASS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.    (_Jurien de la Graviere._)]    The Christian strength was really overwhelming. Eighty Venetian,  thirty-six Papal, and thirty Spanish galleys, together with fifty  sailing galleons, made up a formidable total of nearly two hundred  ships of war, and they carried scarcely less than sixty thousand men,  and two thousand five hundred guns. Doria was in chief command, and  Capello and Grimani led the Venetian and Roman contingents. Barbarossa  had fortunately received but an imperfect report of the enemy's  strength and so boldly pursued his northerly course up the Adriatic.  When he reached Prevesa, the combined fleets had gone on to Corfu, and  he was able to enter unopposed the spacious gulf of Arta, where all  the navies of the world might safely anchor and defy pursuit.    On September 25th, the allied fleets appeared off the entrance to the  gulf, and then for the first time Barbarossa realized his immense good  fortune in being the first in the bay. Outnumbered as he was, a fight  in the open sea might have ended in the total destruction of his navy;  but secure in an ample harbour, on a friendly coast, behind a bar  which the heavier vessels of the enemy could not cross, he could wait  his opportunity and take the foe at a disadvantage. The danger was  that Doria might disembark his guns and attack from the shores of the  gulf, and to meet this risk some of the Turkish captains insisted on  landing their men and trying to erect earthworks for their  protection; but the fire from the Christian ships soon stopped this  manoeuvre. Barbarossa had never expected Doria to hazard a landing,  and he was right. The old admiral of Charles V. was not likely to  expose his ships to the risk of a sally from the Turks just when he  had deprived them of the men and guns that could alone defend them.    The two fleets watched each other warily. Doria and Barbarossa had at  last come face to face for a great battle, but, strange as it may  seem, neither cared to begin: Barbarossa was conscious of serious  numerical inferiority; Doria was anxious for the safety of his fifty  big sailing vessels, on the heavy artillery of which he most relied,  but which a contrary wind might drive to destruction on the hostile  coast. As it was, his guideship on the extreme left had but a fathom  of water under her keel. Each felt keenly the weighty responsibility  of his position, and even the sense that now at last the decisive day  of their long rivalry had come could not stir them from their policy  of prudence. Moreover, it was no longer a question of the prowess of  hot-blooded youth: Doria and Barbarossa and Capello were all men of  nearly seventy years, and Doria was certainly not the man he once was;  politics had spoilt him.    So the two great admirals waited and eyed each other's strength. Will  Barbarossa come out? Or must Doria risk the passage of the bar and  force his way in to the encounter? Neither event happened: but on the  morning of the 27th the Corsairs rubbed their eyes to feel if they  were asleep, as they saw the whole magnificent navy of Christendom,  anchor a-peak, sailing slowly and majestically--_away!_ Were the  Christians afraid? Anyhow no one, not even Barbarossa, could hold the  Turks back now. Out they rushed in hot pursuit, not thinking or  caring--save their shrewd captain--whether this were not a feint of  Doria's to catch them in the open. \"Get into line,\" said Barbarossa to  his captains, \"and do as you see me do.\" Dragut took the right wing,  S[=a]lih Reis the left. Early on the 28th the Christian fleet was  discovered at anchor, in a foul wind, off Santa Maura, thirty miles to  the south. Doria was not at all prepared for such prompt pursuit, and  eyed with anxiety the long battle line of one hundred and forty  galleys, galleots, and brigantines, bearing down upon him before the  wind. His ships were scattered, for the sails could not keep up with  the oars, and Condulmiero's huge Venetian carack was becalmed off  Zuara, a long way behind, and others were in no better plight. Three  hours Doria hesitated, and then gave the order to sail north and meet  the enemy. Condulmiero was already fiercely engaged,"]]]
