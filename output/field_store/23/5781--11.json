Returning soon after, she sought the same price for the  remaining six. Still the price was refused, and she went away and  burned other three books. She again came to the king, and demanded the  same price for the three unconsumed volumes as she had asked for the  nine. Tarquin, who first regarded the woman as a senseless old  creature, became surprised at her strange behaviour, and inquired at  the augurs what he should do. They advised him to give the woman the  price she demanded. The woman delivered the books, and, after desiring  that they should be carefully kept, disappeared, and was never seen  again.    The use of charms and incantations originated in the worship of the  heathen gods. As people in this country believe that spirits, good and  bad, go about at night, so did the Romans suppose that their gods went  up and down the earth during the night to observe the actions of men.  The priests and others, when engaged in acts of piety or important  business, took care, when turning, to move to the right. Every Roman  avoided repeating words of bad omen. Certain days were reckoned  unfortunate for the celebration of marriages. The month of May was  thought an unlucky time for marriages being solemnized. The most  fortunate time for weddings taking place was in the middle of June.  The dress of a bride on her marriage day was a long white robe and her  face was covered with a veil, in token of her modesty; her hair was  divided with the point of a spear into six locks, and she was crowned  with flowers. No marriage was celebrated before recourse to auspices.  The nuptial ceremony was performed in the bride's father's house, or  in the residence of the nearest relation. In the evening the bride was  conducted to her husband's house, taken thither apparently by force  from the arms of her mother or other relative, in memory of the  violence used to the Sabine women. Three boys, whose parents were  alive, attended her; two of them supported her by the arms, while the  third walked before, bearing a flambeau of pine or thorn.  Maid-servants followed with a distaff and wool, intimating that she  was to spin as matrons formerly did. Many relations and friends  attended the nuptial procession. The young men repeated jests and made  sport as she passed along. The bride bound the door-posts of her new  home with woollen fillets, and anointed them with the fat of swine or  wolves, to prevent enchantments. She was lifted over the threshold, or  lightly leaped over it, as it was thought ominous to put her foot upon  it, because the threshold was sacred to Vesta, the goddess of virgins.  Both she and her husband touched fire and water, as all things were  supposed to be produced from these two elements. With the water their  feet were bathed. The husband gave a feast, and musicians attended and  sang the nuptial song. After supper the bride was conducted to her  bed-chamber by matrons who had been only once married, and laid on her  couch, which was covered with flowers; songs were then sung by young  women before the chamber door till midnight. Next day another  entertainment was given by the husband, when presents were sent to the  bride by her friends and relations; and she began her family duties by  performing sacred rites.    Great attention was paid to funeral ceremonies. Many people believed  that the souls of the unburied were not admitted into the abodes of  the dead before they had wandered about the Styx at least a hundred  years. If one happened to discover an unburied body and did not throw  earth on it, he was compelled to expiate his crime by sacrificing a  hog to Ceres. When persons were at the point of death, their nearest  relation present endeavoured to catch the expiring breath with their  mouth, as they believed the soul or living principle went out by the  mouth. The nearest relation among the Romans closed the eyes and mouth  of the deceased, after putting money into the mouth for the ferryman  who was to take the soul of the dead over the lake it had to cross. A  branch of cypress placed at the door where the deceased lay, indicated  that there was a dead body within. People were invited to public  funerals by a herald. Magistrates and priests were supposed to be  violated by seeing a corpse, and therefore the dead were generally  buried at night with torch-light. At funeral processions pipers and  other musicians attended, and women sang the funeral song or the  praises of the deceased to the sound of the flute. By the law of the  twelve tables, the number of flute players was restricted to ten. Next  followed actors and buffoons, who danced and sang, while one of them  imitated the deceased's words and actions when alive. Before the  corpse there were carried the images of the deceased and of his  ancestors. The ancients buried their dead at their own houses, whence  arose the fear of hobgoblins, and a belief in lares, supposed to be  the souls of the deceased.    When the body was laid in the tomb, the people present were sprinkled  three times with pure water by the priest, and when the friends  returned home they were again sprinkled. Beans, lettuces, bread, eggs,  etc. were laid in the tombs, in the belief that the ghosts would come  and eat them. Offerings were made to appease the manes. If a person,  falsely reported to have been dead, returned home, he did not enter  his house by the door, but went into it through the roof. Dead bodies  were often violated for magical purposes, by stripping them of  valuable articles, or cutting off fingers, toes, or arms. Wax images  of deceased persons were made, and, after a variety of ridiculous  ceremonies, burned on piles, from the tops of which eagles were let  loose to convey to heaven the souls set free from the body.

In Ethiopia, superstition was general over the entire empire. The  Ethiopians used a sacred bread, called the corban. While this bread  was being made, the baker was obliged to repeat seven psalms. Upon  every loaf there were twelve impressions of the cross, and each cross  was within a square. Ethiopian monks slept on a mat spread on the  ground, and before lying down they stretched out their hands one  hundred and fifty times in the form of a cross. Baptism was understood  by the people of this empire to be a solemn ceremony that washed away  all impurities; but the rite was observed by nearly all the ancient  nations, in memory of the Deluge.    In an account of the empire of the Great Mogul, we find no end of  superstitious observances. Each heathen Indian tribe had a separate  god. Some tribes even worshipped boiled rice; after the same manner  the Egyptians paid homage to leeks. Indian writers say that, in the  beginning, a woman, whose name was Paraxacti (brought into existence  by the great Creator), had three sons,--the first named Bruma, who  came into life with five heads. He was endowed with the power of  creating all inferior beings. The name of the second was Vixnu,  appointed lord of providence and preserver of all things formed by  Bruma. The third was named Rutrem, whose function or inclination was  to destroy all things his other two brothers had made and preserved.  Rutrem, like his brother Bruma, had five heads. Bruma assumed the form  of a stag; and, to punish him for a serious crime he committed when in  that shape, his brothers and thirty thousand millions of gods punished  him by cutting off one of his heads.    According to the notions of Indian heathens, Bruma writes upon the  forehead of every child an account of all that shall happen to him in  the world. It is reported of Vixnu that he metamorphosed himself at  pleasure. He first took the form and nature of a fish, and the second  form assumed was that of a tortoise. The Indians believed there were  seven seas in the world,--one of milk, of so delicious a nature that  the gods ate butter made of it. One day, when the gods wanted to feast  on the butter according to custom, they brought to the shore of the  milk sea a high mountain of gold, which supported fourteen worlds that  composed the universe. The uppermost part of the mountain served for a  resting place, and over it was brought an adder of monstrous size,  having a hundred heads. The gods made use of this adder as a rope, in  order to get at the butter more easily; but while they were attempting  to procure the butter, the giants, who had a continual hatred against  the gods, drew the adder on the other side with so much violence that  it shook the whole universe, and sunk it so low, that Vixnu, in his  tortoise form, placed himself under it and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#13)"],[1,"little about which to bear a  grudge. He is not humiliated. He merely and unfortunately did not  succeed, or succeeded while unluckily you found him out.    Likewise if one lies to him, cheats him or otherwise mistreats him  in a transaction, he does not permanently lay it up against the  evil-doer. For he knows he would have done the same thing under  similar circumstances. He is prepared to go on next week with the  usual dealings. Of course he will complain with prompt vigor, and  rage in his favorite fashion, but it is only because of his material  loss or discomfort, not because of broken standards of trusted faith  lying dishonored in the dust.    All this alien side of German character thus came to be lain before  Gard like a scroll unrolled. He read its lines with eyes blinking in  wonderment. And this was the people who were to lead the earth.    The only part of it he felt the Buchers did not comprehend and were  disappointed about, was that he did not candidly acknowledge the  porcine truth of all they had shouted at him. He was of a  heterogeneous conglomeration called Yankees. He should admit it. He  was stupid not to. For him not to join in the Bucher chorus of  Germany's greatness was a poor return for all they were doing for  his ease and profit. But he was an American and of course the  Americans--    It must be quickly acknowledged, it is true, that Kirtley's  experiences and observations along these channels did not  necessarily show that the Teuton is less honest than others. Let it  be granted that he is fully as upright as anyone in the sum total of  his commercial transactions. The point Gard uncovered was that here  were full-fledged race traits and habitudes which stood counter to  Christian ideals, were pagan in type, were due to a lower stratum of  moral and social perceptions.    The explosion in Villa Elsa led him on to another revealment. What  was it but a rather puerile performance? Tactless, boisterous  youngsters blurt out the disagreeable sentiments of a household. The  Buchers had acted like children. Laying aside all question of the  wonderful German trained mind, knowledge, efficiency, Gard observed  so much that was boy-like and girl-like in the adult Teuton life. No  country has such a wealth of toys and juvenile story books as  Germany. The Teuton weaves his nursery tales, so grotesque and  strikingly cruel, into his grown-up years. All this influence  continues with him and affects him strongly as long as he lives. The  mature German can kick, sulk, whine, much as his offspring do. When  irritated he can easily act like an _enfant terrible_.    What is quaint, droll, distorted, comically ugly, or of a  gingerbready effect, in Germany, is the expression of this childish  strain. And it appeals particularly there to the youthfulness that  remains in the hearts of visiting foreigners. It is accordingly one  of the most popular Teuton aspects, especially among women and the  young.          CHAPTER XV    MILITARY BLOCKHEADS      Gard's attentions to Elsa continued intermittently, and as if  detached, on their unadvancing course. He had, however, reached the  stage of playing piano duets with her. This is always hopeful.  Occasionally they rambled through Schubert's little Vienna love  waltzes and other selections that could top off an evening with  melodies of a sprightly and sentimental nature. He felt he was  becoming acquainted with her in a way he otherwise could not. She  was more cheerful at these times, exhilarated by the music.    He had learned a large part of his playing by ear. Reading at sight  was a fresh experience. She corrected his fingering while helping  fill out his conversational vocabulary. It was certainly most  agreeable to have Fraeulein take his fingers in her warm, plump,  flexible hand with conscientious authority and show him the method  of the Dresden Conservatoire.    Think of a young and lustrous miss being able to instruct him like a  veteran! He had never considered American girls in such a light--had  never expected to learn anything of profitable skill from them.  Elsa, for her part, regarded it as a curious and amusing experience  to watch this tall man playing like a boy. The musical Germans she  knew were adept at some instrument.    He formed the habit of adding _en_, or its variants, to the English  equivalent of the German word he could not think of, and she seemed  to be struck by this as a very original fashion of eliciting  information. On one occasion at the piano they heard the entrance  bell below clang, announcing a visitor, and Gard, hastening to  disappear upstairs, exclaimed:    \"Wir muessen--wir muessen--_stopfen_!\"    The word for stop would not come to him. Fraeulein blushed and  snickered and ran off to tell her mother about Herr Kirtley and his  German. He was frightened. What absurdity had he uttered? He got to  his dictionary as soon as he could and found he had said--We must  darn stockings!    The incident nearly always put Elsa in good humor. She doubtless  considered Yankees an odd folk. How could they expect to become  civilized with their rudimentary attainments? Must he not be seeming  to her a sort of freak?...    But, for the most part, she continued to hold him aloof, and he  concluded the reason lay in the mystery which shadowed her young  life and to which he could trace no clue. What could it frankly be  that sent her to her room and to Heine? The beginning of the answer  seemed to come at last in the form of a youth who suddenly soared in  at Villa Elsa.    Herr Friedrich von Tielitz-Leibach was a composer and a music  director. He was the son of a neighbor who had moved away, and the  musical Buchers doted on him as one with a shining future. Kirtley  had often heard them refer to Friedrich as to so many of their  friends of whom he knew nothing.    When Friedrich called, at very rare intervals, it was always a  wonderful day. The steady, stolid routine of the home became  perturbed, gladdened. He was a German of Hungarian extraction, and  the Magyar blood gave him a dash and sparkle. He was tall, very  thin, with the intellectual look that black-rimmed glasses produce.  His eyes harmonized in color with the black shock of tossing hair  that set off a distinguished appearance. And, like a traditional  votary of music, he wore a great black cloak swinging around him  with an operatic air, giving the impression that he was just going  to or coming from the theater.    Highly agitated, gilded with flattery, readily acquainted, he  bubbled over promptly in confidences and intimate allusions. He was  ever brimming with the freshest gossip of himself and his exalted  career; and his personal experiences, he assumed, were bound to be  unique and entertaining.    Making friends with everyone, he insisted on calling on Gard up in  the attic room, pleased to welcome such an \"excellent person\"--as he  had heard downstairs--to the fold of the family. But did they not  lead such dull, stagnant, imbecile lives, moored here in this  stodgy, out-of-the-world suburb, where so many idiots live who  wonder how the world can come to an end when it's round? Friedrich  truly hoped Herr Kirtley would not be bored to death.    To-day the musician had finished with his final military examination  and was at last free from ever having to serve. He made a diverting  story of it and had hastened to the Villa to recount the  congratulatory news.    \"I had to report this morning for military service, just having got  back to Dresden. So I went to the Platz and there sat an officer as  big as a hogshead. And I hope not as full. He began treating me as  if I were a truant school boy. 'Stand up! Sit down! Stand up again!'  So the examination commenced. I knew I was not fit for the army. I  did not want to go. I hate it. But they were after me. He said:    \"'Take off your glasses!' I removed them. He said:    \"'What is that letter off there?' Mein Gott! it looked as far off as  Pillnitz. It was my left eye out of which I had seen nothing since I  was a baby.    \"'I see nothing,' I said. He yelled:    \"'You can!' Then I said:    \"'I can't!' Then he roared out:    \"'Why can't you?'    \"'Because I am blind in it!' He glared at me as if I were a  perjurer.    \"'It is blind and you can see nothing out of it?'    \"And now I was getting out of patience with this blockhead. Blind  and can't see out of it! They put the blockheads in the army because  there is no other place for them. I think that must be the reason  why there are more synonyms for blockhead in the German language  than in any other--we have the largest army. I said:    \"'Of course I can't see anything out of it because it's blind,  you---- ' I was just on the point of adding 'fool' when I stopped  myself in time. It was the military--the august _military_. One must  hold his peace before the magnificent military. He thought I was  cheating about my eye because I did not want to march to Moscow, to  Paris. And I don't want to march to Moscow or Paris. They're so far.    \"So this stupid _Kerl_ took me over to a higher officer and still  another. They sat there as stiff and self-complacent as wooden  saints in a plaster church. They too shouted at me They were so  suspicious, although I had never had the pleasure of meeting any of  them before.    \"'You say you are blind in one eye and can't see out of it?'    \"I screamed, 'No, no, no!' They thought I might be going insane.  They examined my eye, my glasses, and tried all kinds of tests to  try to fool my poor eye. But it remained my faithful friend, and  they were mad. And I was just as mad and ready to shriek at  them--'Blind! Blind! Blind!' I was losing half a day for nothing  over their stupidities.    \"Then the _Dummkopfen_ began to enter it up on their official  blotters. That seemed to take forever too. I was nearly exhausted.  They solemnly wrote me down as blind in one eye and cannot see out  of it. And at last,"]]]
