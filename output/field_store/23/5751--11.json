[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#13)"],[1,"No. 20, op. 30, No. 3--see the  original):    [Illustration: Example 49.  Fragment of Chopin.]    [Illustration: Example 49 continued.]      These sixteen measures are the product out of eight measures, by  extension; that is, they are reducible to a simple period-form (as may  be verified by omitting the passages indicated under dotted lines), and  they represent in reality nothing more than its manipulation and  development.  The original 8-measure period makes a complete musical  sentence, and was so devised in the mind of the composer, _without the  extensions_.  The method of manipulation is ingenious; observe the  variety obtained by the striking dynamic changes from _ff_ to _pp_;  and, hand in hand with these, the changes from major to minor, and back  (as shown by the inflection of _b_-flat to _b_-double-flat).  These are  first applied to members only, of the Antecedent, as indicated by the  brackets _a_ and _b_, and then to the entire Consequent phrase.  Observe, also, that in the repeated form of the latter, the rhythm is  modified to a smoother form, during two measures.  The result here  achieved is constant Unity and constant Variety from almost every point  of view, admirably counterbalanced.      THE PHRASE-GROUP.--A second method consists in enlarging the  period-form to three phrases, by the same process of addition which, as  explained in the preceding chapter, transforms the single phrase into  the double-phrase or period.  In order to preserve the continuity of  the three phrases, it is evident that the second phrase must _also_  close with a semicadence,--the perfect cadence being deferred until the  last phrase is concluded.    {78}    This form, be it well understood, does not include any of the  triple-phrase designs which may result from merely repeating one or the  other of the two phrases that make a period, as is shown in Ex. 48.  _All such phrase-clusters as are reducible to two phrases_, because  nothing more than simple repetition has been employed in their  multiplication, should always be classed among ordinary periods; for  two successive phrases, if connected (that is, unless they are  purposely broken asunder by a definite perfect cadence at the end of  the first phrase) always represent the analogy of Question and Answer.    The enlarged form we are at present considering consists of three  _different_ phrases, as a general rule; probably very closely related,  or even distinctly resembling one another; but too independent,  nevertheless, to constitute actual repetition, and therefore to admit  of reduction to two phrases.  For this very reason it cannot justly be  called \"period\" at all, but takes the name of \"phrase-group.\"  An  illustration by diagram will make the distinction clear:--    [Illustration: Phrase group diagram.]      Observe that the classification depends upon the number of  phrases,--upon the _melodic_ identity of the phrases,--and upon the  _quality of the cadences_.    No. 1 is illustrated in Ex. 15; No. 2, in Ex. 42 and the first four  measures of Ex. 43 (cadence not perfect, it is true, but same  phrase-melody and _same cadence_); No. 3 is seen in Ex. 44  (phrase-melody similar, but cadences different)--also in Ex. 47; No. 4  is seen in Ex. 48; No. 5 is rare, but an example will be discovered in  Lesson 8; No. 6 is illustrated in the following (Grieg, op. 38, No.  2):--    [Illustration: Example 50.  Fragment of Grieg.]      Comparing this sentence with Ex. 48, we discover the following  significant difference: There, no more than two phrases were present;  the whole sentence was _reducible_ to two phrases.  Here (Ex. 50),  however, no such reduction is possible; three sufficiently similar--and  sufficiently different--phrases are coherently connected, without  evidence of mere repetition; it is the result of Addition, and the form  is a _phrase-group_.  The first cadence is, strictly speaking, a  _perfect_ one; but of that somewhat doubtful rhythmic character, which,  in conjunction with other indications, may diminish its conclusive  effect, and prevent the decided separation which usually attends the  perfect cadence.  This is apt to be the case with a perfect cadence _so  near the beginning_ (like this one) that the impression of \"conclusion\"  is easily overcome.  In a word, there is no doubt of the unbroken  connection of these three phrases, despite the unusual weight of the  first cadence.  See also the first cadence in Ex. 51.    By simply continuing the process of addition (and avoiding a decisive  perfect cadence) the phrase-group may be extended to more than three  phrases, though this is not common.      THE DOUBLE-PERIOD.--A third method consists in expanding the period  into a double-period (precisely as the phrase was lengthened into a  double-phrase, or period), _by avoiding a perfect cadence at the end of  the second phrase_, and adding another pair of phrases to balance the  first pair.  It thus embraces four _coherent_ phrases, with a total  length of sixteen measures (when regular and unextended).    An important feature of the double-period is that the second period  usually resembles the first one very closely, at least in its first  members.  That is, the second phrase contrasts with the first; _the  third corroborates the first_; and the fourth either resembles the  second, or contrasts with all three preceding phrases.  This is not  always--though nearly always--the case.    The double-period in music finds its poetic analogy in almost any  stanza of four fairly long lines, that being a design in which we  expect unity of meaning throughout, the progressive evolution of one  continuous thought, uniformity of metric structure (mostly in  _alternate_ lines), the corroboration of rhyme, and, at the same time,  some degree and kind of contrast,--as in the following stanza of  Tennyson's:      Phrase 1.  \"The splendor falls on castle walls,    Phrase 2.     And snowy summits old in story;    Phrase 3.   The long light shakes across the lakes,    Phrase 4.     And the wild cataract leaps in glory.\"    The analogy is not complete; one is not likely to find, anywhere,  absolute parallelism between music and poetry; but it is near enough to  elucidate the musical purpose and character of the double-period.  And  it accounts for the very general choice of this form for the hymn-tune.    The following illustrates the double-period, in its most regular and  convincing form (Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 49, No. 1):--    [Illustration: Example 51.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    Each phrase is four measures long, as usual; the first one ends (as in  Ex. 50) with one of those early, transient perfect cadences that do not  break the continuity of the sentence; the second phrase ends with a  semicadence,--therefore the sentence remains unbroken; phrase three is  _exactly_ like the first, and is therefore an Antecedent, as before;  phrase four bears close resemblance to the second one, but differs at  the end, on account of the perfect cadence.  The evidences of Unity and  Variety are easily detected.  The main points are, that the second pair  of phrases balances the first pair, and that the two periods are  connected (not _separate_ periods).  See also Ex. 53, first 16 measures.      LESSON 8.--Analyze the following examples.  They are not classified;  therefore the student must himself determine to which of the above  three species of enlargement each belongs:    Mendelssohn, Songs Without Words, No. 29, measures 1-21, (first 4  measures an introductory phrase).    No. 37, first 17 measures.    No. 30, first 15 measures (last phrase irregular).    No. 16, measures 4-9 (small phrases).    No. 33, first 12 measures.    No. 27, first 20 measures (introductory phrase).    No. 3, first 29 measures, to double-bar (introductory phrase).    No. 36, first 27 measures (the similarity between phrase one and phrase  three proves the double-period form; the extra phrases are extension by  \"addition,\" as in the group form).    No. 6, measures 8-17.    Mozart, pianoforte sonata.  No. 13 (Peters edition), first 16 measures.    Sonata No. 2, first 16 measures (last four measures are extension).    Sonata No. 3, last movement, first 16 measures.    Sonata No. 10, second movement, first 16 measures.    Beethoven, pianoforte sonatas; op. 49, No. 2, first 12 measures.    Op. 10, No. 3, first 16 measures.    Op. 10, No. 2, first 12 measures.    Op. 26, first 16 measures.    Op. 31, No. 2, last movement, first 31 measures (extension by  repetition).    Schumann, op. 68, Nos. 16, 20, 33, first 16 measures of each; No. 13,  first 10 measures; No. 15, first 16 measures.          CHAPTER IX.  THE TWO-PART SONG-FORM.    THE SONG-FORM OR THE PART-FORM.--Almost every musical composition of  average (brief) dimensions, if designed with the serious purpose of  imparting a clear formal impression, will admit of division into either  two or three fairly distinct sections, or Parts, of approximately equal  length.  The distinctness with which the points of separation are  marked, and the degree of independence of each of these two or three  larger sections, are determined almost entirely by the length of the  whole.  And whether there be two or three such divisions depends to  some extent also upon the length of the piece, though chiefly upon the  specific structural idea to be embodied.    A composition that contains two such sections is called a Two-Part (or  bipartite, or binary) form; and one that contains three, a Three-part  (tripartite, or ternary) form.    Such rare exceptions to these structural arrangements as may be  encountered in musical literature, are limited to sentences that, on  one hand, are so brief as to require no radical division; and, on the  other, to compositions of very elaborate dimensions, extending beyond  this structural distinction; and, furthermore, to fantastic pieces in  which the intentional absence of classified formal disposition"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#13)"],[1,"proceeded westward.      \"The Me-da-we lodge was pulled down, and it was not again erected till    our forefathers again took a stand on the shores of the great river    where Mo-ne-aung (Montreal) now stands.      \"In the course of time this town was again deserted, and our    forefathers, still proceeding westward, lit not their fires till they    reached the shores of Lake Huron, where again the rites of the    Me-da-we were practiced.      \"Again these rites were forgotten, and the Me-da-we lodge was not    built till the Ojibways found themselves congregated at Bow-e-ting    (outlet of Lake Superior), where it remained for many winters. Still    the Ojibways moved westward, and for the last time the Me-da-we lodge    was erected on the island of La Pointe, and here, long before the pale    face appeared among them, it was practiced in its purest and most    original form. Many of our fathers lived the full term of life granted    to mankind by the Great Spirit, and the forms of many old people were    mingled with each rising generation. This, my grandson, is the meaning    of the words you did not understand; they have been repeated to us by    our fathers for many generations.\"        [Footnote 12: Op. cit., p. 78 et seq.]    In the explanation of the chart obtained at Red Lake, together with the  tradition, reference to the otter, as being the most sacred emblem of  society, is also verified in a brief notice of a tradition by Mr.  Warren,[13] as follows:      There is another tradition told by the old men of the Ojibway village    of Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, which tells of their former residence    on the shores of the great salt water. It is, however, so similar in    character to the one I have related that its introduction here would    only occupy unnecessary space. The only difference between the two    traditions is that the otter, which is emblematical of one of the four    Medicine Spirits who are believed to preside over the Midawe rites, is    used in one in the same figurative manner as the seashell is used in    the other, first appearing to the ancient An-ish-in-aub-ag from the    depths of the great salt water, again on the river St. Lawrence, then    on Lake Huron at Sault Ste. Marie, again at La Pointe, but lastly at    Fond du Lac, or end of Lake Superior, where it is said to have forced    the sand bank at the mouth of the St. Louis River. The place is still    pointed out by the Indians where they believe the great otter broke    through.        [Footnote 13: Op. cit., p. 81.]    It is affirmed by the Indians that at Sault Ste. Marie some of the  Ojibwa separated from the main body of that tribe and traversed the  country along the northern shore of Lake Superior toward the west. These  have since been known of as the \"Bois Forts\" (hardwood people or timber  people), other bands being located at Pigeon River, Rainy Lake, etc.  Another separation occurred at La Pointe, one party going toward Fond du  Lac and westward to Red Lake, where they claim to have resided for more  than three hundred years, while the remainder scattered from La Pointe  westward and southwestward, locating at favorable places throughout the  timbered country. This early dismemberment and long-continued separation  of the Ojibwa nation accounts, to a considerable extent, for the several  versions of the migration and the sacred emblems connected with the  Mid[-e]/wiwin, the northern bands generally maintaining their faith in  favor of the Otter as the guide, while the southern bodies are almost  entirely supporters of the belief in the great m[-i]/gis.    On account of the independent operations of the Mid[-e]/ priests in the  various settlements of the Ojibwa, and especially because of the slight  intercourse between those of the northern and southern divisions of the  nation, there has arisen a difference in the pictographic representation  of the same general ideas, variants which are frequently not recognized  by Mid[-e]/ priests who are not members of the Mid[-e]/wiwin in which  these mnemonic charts had their origin. As there are variants in the  pictographic delineation of originally similar ideas, there are also  corresponding variations in the traditions pertaining to them.      [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Birch-bark record, from White Earth.]    The tradition relating to Mi/nab[-o]/zho and the sacred objects received  from Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] for the Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g is illustrated in  Fig. 6, which is a reproduction of a chart preserved at White Earth. The  record is read from left to right. No. 1 represents Mi/nab[-o]/zho, who  says of the adjoining characters representing the members of the  Mid[-e]/wiwin: \"They are the ones, they are the ones, who put into my  heart the life.\" Mi/nab[-o]/zho holds in his left hand the sacred  Mid[-e]/ sack, or pin-ji/-gu-s[^a]n/. Nos. 2 and 3 represent the  drummers. At the sound of the drum all the Mid[-e]/ rise and become  inspired, because Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] is then present in the wig/iwam.  No. 4 denotes that women also have the privilege of becoming members of  the Mid[-e]/wiwin. The figure holds in the left hand the Mid[-e]/ sack,  made of a snake skin. No. 5 represents the Tortoise, the guardian spirit  who was the giver of some of the sacred objects used in the rite. No. 6,  the Bear, also a benevolent Man/id[-o], but not held in so great  veneration as the Tortoise. His tracks are visible in the Mid[-e]/wiwin.  No. 7, the sacred Mid[-e]/ sack or pin-ji/-gu-s[^a]n/, which contains  life, and can be used by the Mid[-e]/ to prolong the life of a sick  person. No. 8 represents a Dog, given by the Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s to  Mi/nab[-o]/zho as a companion.    Such was the interpretation given by the owner of the chart, but the  informant was unconsciously in error, as has been ascertained not only  from other Mid[-e]/ priests consulted with regard to the true meaning,  but also in the light of later information and research in the  exemplification of the ritual of the Mid[-e]/wiwin.    Mi/nab[-o]/zho did not receive the rite from any Mid[-e]/ priests (Nos.  2 and 5), but from Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]. Women are not mentioned in any of  the earlier traditions of the origin of the society, neither was the dog  given to Mi/nab[-o]/zho, but Mi/nab[-o]/zho gave it to the  Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g.    The chart, therefore, turns out to be a mnemonic song similar to others  to be noted hereafter, and the owner probably copied it from a chart in  the possession of a stranger Mid[-e]/, and failed to learn its true  signification, simply desiring it to add to his collection of sacred  objects and to gain additional respect from his confreres and admirers.      [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Birch-bark record, from Red Lake.]      [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Birch-bark record, from Red Lake.]    Two similar and extremely old birch-bark mnemonic songs were found in  the possession of a Mid[-e]/ at Red Lake. The characters upon these are  almost identical, one appearing to be a copy of the other. These are  reproduced in Figs. 7 and 8. By some of the Mid[-e]/ Esh/gib[-o]/ga  takes the place of Mi/nab[-o]/zho as having originally received the  Mid[-e]/wiwin from Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], but it is believed that the word  is a synonym or a substitute based upon some reason to them  inexplicable. These figures were obtained in 1887, and a brief  explanation of them given in the American Anthropologist.[14] At that  time I could obtain but little direct information from the owners of the  records, but it has since been ascertained that both are mnemonic songs  pertaining to Mi/nab[-o]/zho, or rather Eshgib[-o]/ga, and do not form a  part of the sacred records of the Mid[-e]/wiwin, but simply the  pictographic representation of the possibilities and powers of the  alleged religion. The following explanation of Figs. 7 and 8 is  reproduced from the work just cited. A few annotations and corrections  are added. The numbers apply equally to both illustrations:      No. 1, represents Esh/gib[-o]/ga, the great uncle of the      Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g, and receiver of the Mid[-e]/wiwin.      No. 2, the drum and drumsticks used by Esh/gib[-o]/ga.      No. 3, a bar or rest, denoting an interval of time before the song is      resumed.      No. 4, the pin-ji/-gu-s[^a]n/ or sacred Mid[-e]/ sack. It consists of      an otter skin, and is the m[-i]/gis or sacred symbol of the      Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n.      No. 5. a Mid[-e]/ priest, the one who holds the m[-i]/gis while      chanting the Mid[-e]/ song in the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n. He is inspired,      as indicated by the line extending from the heart to the mouth.      No. 6, denotes that No. 5 is a member of the Mid[-e]/wiwin. This      character, with the slight addition of lines extending upward from      the straight top line, is usually employed by the more southern      Ojibwa to denote the wig/iwam of a J[)e]ss/akk[-i]d/, or jugglery.      No. 7, is a woman, and signifies that women may also be admitted to      the Mid[-e]/wiwin.      No. 8, a pause or rest.      No. 9, a snake-skin pin-ji/-gu-s[^a]n/ possessing the power of giving      life. This power is indicated by the lines radiating from the head,      and the back of the skin.      No. 10, represents a woman.      No. 11, is another illustration of the m[-i]/gis, or otter.      No. 12, denotes a priestess who is inspired, as shown by the line      extending from the heart to the mouth in Fig. 7, and simply showing      the heart in Fig. 6. In the latter she is also empowered to cure      with magic plants.      No. 13, in Fig. 7, although representing a Mid[-e]/ priest, no      explanation was given.        [Footnote 14: Vol. 1, No. 3, 1888, p. 216, Figs. 2 and 3.]      [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Esh/gib[-o]/ga.]    Fig. 9 is presented as a variant of the characters shown in No. 1 of  Figs. 7 and 8. The fact that this denotes the power of curing by the use  of magic plants would appear to indicate an older and more"]]]
