Why it was so rich in species is a question on  which geology will one day be able to throw light, for much may depend  on the relations of land and sea in earlier epochs of the earth's  history. Probably the great diversities of elevation and of climate  which exist in the southern part of the continent have contributed to  this profuse variety; and the fact that the country was occupied only by  savages, who did little or nothing to extinguish any species nature had  planted, may have caused many weak species to survive when equally weak  ones were perishing in Asia and Europe at the hands of more advanced  races of mankind. The country was therefore the paradise of hunters.  Besides the lion and the leopard, there were many other great cats, some  of remarkable beauty. Besides the elephant, which was in some districts  very abundant, there existed two kinds of rhinoceros, as well as the  hippopotamus and the giraffe. There was a wonderful profusion of  antelopes,--thirty-one species have been enumerated,--including such  noble animals as the eland and koodoo, such beautiful ones as the  springbok and klipspringer, such fierce ones as the blue wildebeest or  gnu. There were two kinds of zebra, a quagga, and a buffalo, both huge  and dangerous. Probably nowhere in the world could so great a variety of  beautiful animals be seen or a larger variety of formidable ones be  pursued.    All this has changed, and changed of late years with fatal speed, under  the increasing range and accuracy of firearms, the increasing  accessibility of the country to the European sportsman, and the  increasing number of natives who possess guns. The Dutch Boer of eighty  years ago was a good marksman and loved the chase, but he did not shoot  for fame and in order to write about his exploits, while the  professional hunter who shot to sell ivory or rare specimens had hardly  begun to exist. The work of destruction has latterly gone on so fast  that the effect of stating what is still left can hardly be to tempt  others to join in that work, but may help to show how urgent is the duty  of arresting the process of extermination.    When the first Dutchmen settled at the Cape the lion was so common as to  be one of the every-day perils of life. Tradition points out a spot in  the pleasure-ground attached to the Houses of Parliament at Cape Town  where a lion was found prowling in what was then the commandant's  garden. In 1653 it was feared that lions would storm the fort to get at  the sheep within it, and so late as 1694 they killed nine cows within  sight of the present castle. To-day, however, if the lion is to be found  at all within the limits of Cape Colony, it is only in the wilderness  along the banks of the Orange River. He was abundant in the Orange Free  State when it became independent in 1854, but has been long extinct  there. He survives in a few spots in the north of the Transvaal and in  the wilder parts of Zululand and Bechuanaland, and is not unfrequent in  Matabililand and Mashonaland. One may, however, pass through those  countries, as I did in October, 1895, without having a chance of seeing  the beast or even hearing its nocturnal voice, and those who go hunting  this grandest of all quarries are often disappointed. In the strip of  flat land between the mountains and the Indian Ocean behind Sofala and  Beira, and in the Zambesi valley, there remain lions enough; but the  number diminishes so fast that even in that malarious and thinly peopled  land none may be left thirty years hence.    The leopard is still to be found all over the country, except where the  population is thickest; and as the leopard haunts rocky places, it is,  though much hunted for the sake of its beautiful skin, less likely to be  exterminated. Some of the smaller carnivora, especially the pretty  lynxes, have now become very rare. There is a good supply of hyenas, but  they are ugly.    Elephants used to roam in great herds over all the more woody districts,  but have now been quite driven out of Cape Colony, Natal, and the two  Dutch republics, save that in a narrow strip of forest country near the  south coast, between Mossel Bay and Algoa Bay, some herds are preserved  by the Cape government. So, too, in the north of the Transvaal there are  still a few left, also specially preserved. It is only on the east coast  south of the Zambesi, and here and there along that river, that the wild  elephant can now be found. From these regions it will soon vanish, and  unless something is done to stop the hunting of elephants the total  extinction of the animal in Africa may be expected within another  half-century; for the foolish passion for slaughter which sends  so-called sportsmen on his track, and the high price of ivory, are  lessening its numbers day by day. A similar fate awaits the rhinoceros,  once common even near the Cape, where he overturned one day the coach of  a Dutch governor. The white kind, which is the larger, is now all but  extinct, while the black rhinoceros has become scarce even in the  northern regions between the Limpopo and the Zambesi. The hippopotamus,  protected by his aquatic habits, has fared better, and may still be seen  plunging and splashing in the waters of the Pungwe, the Limpopo, and  other rivers in Portuguese East Africa. But Natal will soon know this  great amphibian no more; and within Cape Colony, where the creature was  once abundant even in the swamps that bordered Table Bay, he is now to  be found only in the pools along the lower course of the Orange River.  The crocodile holds his ground better, and is still a serious danger to  oxen who go down to drink at the streams. In Zululand and all along the  east coast, as well as in the streams of Mashonaland and Matabililand,  there is hardly a pool which does not contain some of these formidable  saurians. Even when the water shrinks in the dry season till little but  mud seems to be left, the crocodile, getting deep into the mud,  maintains a torpid life till the rains bring him back into activity. Lo  Bengula sometimes cast those who had displeased him, bound hand and  foot, into a river to be devoured by these monsters, which he did not  permit to be destroyed, probably because they were sacred to some  tribes.    The giraffe has become very scarce, though a herd or two are left in the  south of Matabililand, and a larger number in the Kalahari Desert. So,  also, the zebra and many of the species of antelopes, especially the  larger kinds, like the eland and the sable, are disappearing, while the  buffalo is now only to be seen (except in a part of the Colony where a  herd is preserved) in the Portuguese territories along the Zambesi and  the east coast. The recent cattle-plague has fallen heavily upon him.  So the ostrich would probably now remain only in the wilds of the  Kalahari had not large farms been created in Cape Colony, where young  broods are reared for the sake of the feathers. On these farms,  especially near Graham's Town and in the Oudtshorn district, one may see  great numbers; nor is there a prettier sight than that of two parent  birds running along, with a numerous progeny of little ones around them.  Though in a sense domesticated, they are often dangerous, for they kick  forward and claw downward with great violence, and the person whom they  knock down and begin to trample on has little chance of escape with his  life. Fortunately, it is easy to drive them off with a stick or even an  umbrella; and we were warned not to cross an ostrich-farm without some  such defence.    Snakes, though there are many venomous species, seem to be less feared  than in India or the wilder parts of Australia. The python grows to  twenty feet or more, but is, of course, not poisonous, and never assails  man unless first molested. The black _momba_, which is nearly as large  as a rattlesnake, is, however, a dangerous creature, being ready to  attack man without provocation, and the bite may prove fatal in less  than an hour. One sees many skins of this snake in the tropical parts of  South Africa, and hears many thrilling tales of combats with them. They  are no longer common in the more settled and temperate regions.    Although even in Cape Colony and the Dutch republics there is still more  four-footed game to be had than anywhere in Europe, there remain only  two regions where large animals can be killed in any considerable  numbers. One of these is the Portuguese territory between Delagoa Bay  and the Zambesi, together with the adjoining parts of the Transvaal,  where the lower spurs of the Quathlamba Range descend to the plain. This  district is very malarious during and after the rains, and most of it  unhealthy at all seasons. The other region is the Kalahari Desert and  the country north of it between Lake Ngami and the Upper Zambesi. The  Kalahari is so waterless as to offer considerable difficulties to  European hunters, and the country round Lake Ngami is swampy and  feverish. So far the wild creatures have nature in their favour; yet the  passion for killing is in many persons so strong that neither thirst nor  fever deters them, and if the large game are to be saved, it will  clearly be necessary to place them under legal protection. This has been  attempted so far as regards the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, and  eland. In German East Africa Dr. von Wissmann, the Administrator of that  territory, has recently (1896) gone further, and ordained restrictions  on the slaughter of all the larger animals, except predatory ones. The  governments of the two British colonies and the two Boer republics,  which have already done well in trying to preserve some of the rarest  and finest beasts, ought to go thoroughly into the question and enact a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#13)"],[1,"their thirst and to tell one another  interminable stories without any point whatsoever. But the Marshmoreton  Arms is a comfortable, respectable hostelry, catering for the village  plutocrats. There of an evening you will find the local veterinary  surgeon smoking a pipe with the grocer, the baker, and the butcher, with  perhaps a sprinkling of neighbouring farmers to help the conversation  along. On Saturdays there is a \"shilling ordinary\"--which is rural  English for a cut off the joint and a boiled potato, followed by hunks  of the sort of cheese which believes that it pays to advertise, and this  is usually well attended. On the other days of the week, until late in  the evening, however, the visitor to the Marshmoreton Arms has the place  almost entirely to himself.    It is to be questioned whether in the whole length and breadth of  the world there is a more admirable spot for a man in love to pass  a day or two than the typical English village. The Rocky Mountains,  that traditional stamping-ground for the heartbroken, may be well  enough in their way; but a lover has to be cast in a pretty stern  mould to be able to be introspective when at any moment he may meet  an annoyed cinnamon bear. In the English village there are no such  obstacles to meditation. It combines the comforts of civilization  with the restfulness of solitude in a manner equalled by no other  spot except the New York Public Library. Here your lover may wander  to and fro unmolested, speaking to nobody, by nobody addressed, and  have the satisfaction at the end of the day of sitting down to a  capitally cooked chop and chips, lubricated by golden English ale.    Belpher, in addition to all the advantages of the usual village,  has a quiet charm all its own, due to the fact that it has seen  better days. In a sense, it is a ruin, and ruins are always  soothing to the bruised soul. Ten years before, Belpher had been a  flourishing centre of the South of England oyster trade. It is  situated by the shore, where Hayling Island, lying athwart the  mouth of the bay, forms the waters into a sort of brackish lagoon,  in much the same way as Fire Island shuts off the Great South Bay  of Long Island from the waves of the Atlantic. The water of Belpher  Creek is shallow even at high tide, and when the tide runs out it  leaves glistening mud flats, which it is the peculiar taste of the  oyster to prefer to any other habitation. For years Belpher oysters  had been the mainstay of gay supper parties at the Savoy, the  Carlton and Romano's. Dukes doted on them; chorus girls wept if  they were not on the bill of fare. And then, in an evil hour,  somebody discovered that what made the Belpher Oyster so  particularly plump and succulent was the fact that it breakfasted,  lunched and dined almost entirely on the local sewage. There is but  a thin line ever between popular homage and execration. We see it  in the case of politicians, generals and prize-fighters; and  oysters are no exception to the rule. There was a typhoid  scare--quite a passing and unjustified scare, but strong enough to  do its deadly work; and almost overnight Belpher passed from a  place of flourishing industry to the sleepy, by-the-world-forgotten  spot which it was when George Bevan discovered it. The shallow  water is still there; the mud is still there; even the oyster-beds  are still there; but not the oysters nor the little world of  activity which had sprung up around them. The glory of Belpher is  dead; and over its gates Ichabod is written. But, if it has lost in  importance, it has gained in charm; and George, for one, had no  regrets. To him, in his present state of mental upheaval, Belpher  was the ideal spot.    It was not at first that George roused himself to the point of  asking why he was here and what--now that he was here--he proposed  to do. For two languorous days he loafed, sufficiently occupied  with his thoughts. He smoked long, peaceful pipes in the  stable-yard, watching the ostlers as they groomed the horses; he  played with the Inn puppy, bestowed respectful caresses on the Inn  cat. He walked down the quaint cobbled street to the harbour,  sauntered along the shore, and lay on his back on the little beach  at the other side of the lagoon, from where he could see the red  roofs of the village, while the imitation waves splashed busily on  the stones, trying to conceal with bustle and energy the fact that  the water even two hundred yards from the shore was only eighteen  inches deep. For it is the abiding hope of Belpher Creek that it  may be able to deceive the occasional visitor into mistaking it for  the open sea.    And presently the tide would ebb. The waste of waters became a sea  of mud, cheerfully covered as to much of its surface with green  grasses. The evening sun struck rainbow colours from the moist  softness. Birds sang in the thickets. And George, heaving himself  up, walked back to the friendly cosiness of the Marshmoreton Arms.  And the remarkable part of it was that everything seemed perfectly  natural and sensible to him, nor had he any particular feeling that  in falling in love with Lady Maud Marsh and pursuing her to Belpher  he had set himself anything in the nature of a hopeless task. Like  one kissed by a goddess in a dream, he walked on air; and, while  one is walking on air, it is easy to overlook the boulders in the  path.    Consider his position, you faint-hearted and self-pitying young men  who think you have a tough row to hoe just because, when you pay  your evening visit with the pound box of candy under your arm, you  see the handsome sophomore from Yale sitting beside her on the  porch, playing the ukulele. If ever the world has turned black to  you in such a situation and the moon gone in behind a cloud, think  of George Bevan and what he was up against. You are at least on the  spot. You can at least put up a fight. If there are ukuleles in the  world, there are also guitars, and tomorrow it may be you and not  he who sits on the moonlit porch; it may be he and not you who  arrives late. Who knows? Tomorrow he may not show up till you have  finished the Bedouin's Love Song and are annoying the local birds,  roosting in the trees, with Poor Butterfly.    What I mean to say is, you are on the map. You have a sporting  chance. Whereas George... Well, just go over to England and try  wooing an earl's daughter whom you have only met once--and then  without an introduction; whose brother's hat you have smashed  beyond repair; whose family wishes her to marry some other man: who  wants to marry some other man herself--and not the same other man,  but another other man; who is closely immured in a mediaeval castle  . . . Well, all I say is--try it. And then go back to your porch  with a chastened spirit and admit that you might be a whole lot  worse off.    George, as I say, had not envisaged the peculiar difficulties of  his position. Nor did he until the evening of his second day at the  Marshmoreton Arms. Until then, as I have indicated, he roamed in a  golden mist of dreamy meditation among the soothing by-ways of the  village of Belpher. But after lunch on the second day it came upon  him that all this sort of thing was pleasant but not practical.  Action was what was needed. Action.    The first, the obvious move was to locate the castle. Inquiries at  the Marshmoreton Arms elicited the fact that it was \"a step\" up the  road that ran past the front door of the inn. But this wasn't the  day of the week when the general public was admitted. The  sightseer could invade Belpher Castle on Thursdays only, between  the hours of two and four. On other days of the week all he could  do was to stand like Moses on Pisgah and take in the general effect  from a distance. As this was all that George had hoped to be able  to do, he set forth.    It speedily became evident to George that \"a step\" was a euphemism.  Five miles did he tramp before, trudging wearily up a winding lane,  he came out on a breeze-swept hill-top, and saw below him, nestling  in its trees, what was now for him the centre of the world. He sat  on a stone wall and lit a pipe. Belpher Castle. Maud's home. There  it was. And now what?    The first thought that came to him was practical, even prosaic--  the thought that he couldn't possibly do this five-miles-there  and-five-miles-back walk, every time he wanted to see the place.  He must shift his base nearer the scene of operations. One of those  trim, thatched cottages down there in the valley would be just the  thing, if he could arrange to take possession of it. They sat there  all round the castle, singly and in groups, like small dogs round  their master. They looked as if they had been there for centuries.  Probably they had, as they were made of stone as solid as that of  the castle. There must have been a time, thought George, when the  castle was the central rallying-point for all those scattered  homes; when rumour of danger from marauders had sent all that  little community scuttling for safety to the sheltering walls.    For the first time since he had set out on his expedition, a  certain chill, a discomforting sinking of the heart, afflicted  George as he gazed down at the grim grey fortress which he had  undertaken to storm. So must have felt those marauders of old when  they climbed to the top of this very hill to spy out the land. And  George's case was even worse than theirs. They could at least hope  that a strong arm and a stout heart would carry them past those  solid walls; they had not to think of social etiquette. Whereas  George was so situated that an unsympathetic butler could put him to  rout by refusing him admittance.    The evening was drawing in. Already, in the brief time he had spent  on the hill-top, the sky had turned from blue to saffron and from  saffron to grey. The plaintive voices of homing cows floated up to  him from the valley below. A bat had left its"]]]
