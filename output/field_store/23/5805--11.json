The project is being put through by  the Marseilles Chamber of Commerce, which found $8,000,000 of the  $18,280,000 required to do the work. The balance will be paid by vessel  tolls. The canal runs from Arles to the Mediterranean, a distance of  fifty-one miles, making a navigable waterway to the usable portion of  the Rhone and the Saone, opening 337 miles of water capable of bearing  600-ton lighters. By this canal and links already available, barges can  be sent from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.    On Monday, September the 25th, I called upon the Consul General A.  Gaulin. I found him a very agreeable gentleman and quite devoted to his  work, a great deal of which consisted in helping needy Americans  stranded in France.    The Commission was invited to luncheon at the Hotel Reserve, overlooking  the Mediterranean and the Chateau D'If. On my right sat the president of  the Marseilles Chamber of Commerce, Adrien Artaud, and on my left sat  Lucien Estrine, former president of the Marseilles Chamber of Commerce.  At this elevated hotel, tradition has it, the Count of Monte Cristo and  his bride had their wedding breakfast.    In the afternoon an open meeting was held by the Chamber of Commerce at  the Regina Hotel. This meeting was attended by citizens of Marseilles  interested in the import and export business. The question of credits  was pretty thoroughly discussed. It was stated by a number of Frenchmen  present that the coveting of the iron ore and coal deposits of France by  the Germans was the real cause of the war.          IX.    TOWNS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE      We left Marseilles on Tuesday, September 26th, at 6 A. M. for Grenoble.  The sunrise was very beautiful; along the way you can see trees, the  tops of which have been chopped off. We were told that the annual crop  of fire-wood in France is just the same as the annual crop of wheat or  any other product. Fast growing trees are planted and the branches and  twigs are utilized for fuel.    We were met at the Grenoble station by eight entirely new Dodge  automobiles.    At Grenoble, we visited the glove factory of Perrin & Co. This firm is  well known in the United States and we were informed that our country is  its best customer. In normal times the concern employes twenty thousand  men and women, equally divided. The product is twenty million pairs of  gloves annually. Much of the work is taken home for execution. The shop  is well lighted and the sanitary conditions seem to be all of the very  best. We visited the Raymond button factory and the candy factory of  Davin & Company. This was a very interesting experience. At the close,  or rather before leaving the factory, we were permitted to witness the  decoration of a workman who had been in the employment of the company  for thirty-five years. It was really an affecting sight. We were told  that in all that time he had not lost a day from sickness and the time  had arrived when he was entitled to a pension. He was decorated by the  head of the firm. At the close of the ceremonies he was surrounded by  his family, relatives and members of the firm, and greeted in the usual  way of the French with their own countrymen, that is to say, by kissing  and embracing.    On Wednesday, September 27th, at seven in the morning, we left Grenoble  for the French Alps. We had as a guide John Steel, an American who had  been in France for fifteen years and had become a French citizen. He  gave us much valuable information. He said, among other things, that  when the railroads in France take freight they guarantee the time of  delivery, if desired, and include an extra charge in the rate. On this  trip we passed three companies of mounted guns, the technical name being  mountain artillery. This was an interesting sight. A portion consisted  of donkeys with all the paraphernalia of a soldier strapped to their  backs, together with rapid firing mitrailleuses. The soldiers were  unusually fine looking men from the Alpine district, a portion of France  near the Swiss border.    [Illustration: Types from French Provinces.]    We visited a paper mill where the entire product was cardboard. We  passed the \"Escole de Garcons,\" otherwise a school for teaching  waiters. We were told by Mr. Steel that in the valley adjoining that in  which we were driving anthracite coal exists in abundance but has not  been worked to any great extent. We passed mountain villages and noticed  the cultivation of the sides of mountains almost perpendicular. It was a  wonderful ride, amid splendid scenery, with numerous waterfalls, snow  and glaciers in great abundance; in other words, we were going through  the Switzerland of France. We passed a flock of sheep, more than five  thousand in number, cared for by a head shepherdess, with several  assistants and a number of dogs.    We had luncheon at the Grand Hotel Bourg D'Oison and stopped briefly at  the hotel de La Meige.    On our return down the mountain we visited an electric manufacturing  plant, the products being aluminum, magnesium, sodium, peroxide, sodium,  oxolyte, calcium, and hydrated calcium. In this factory one of the  commissioners had a narrow escape from certain injury, if not death, by  attempting to taste the chemicals. He was stopped just in time.    We then visited the Chateau Vizille, built in the seventeenth century  and at one time occupied by Casimer de Perier, President of France.  Vizille was one of the three great marshalls of France, and the chateau  is called the \"Cradle of Liberty\". The first French Revolutionary  meeting was held here. The castle contained old cannon and splendid old  furniture, while the surrounding grounds were beautiful.    On Thursday, September 28th, we visited the paper manufacturing plant of  Berges at Lancey. There is an immense water-power installation here, the  capacity of the plant being one hundred tons daily of all grades of  paper. There are two plants, one a very old one, dating back nearly two  hundred years, and the other a new one, not quite completed. We saw here  one machine which cost one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, a  remarkable piece of mechanism, almost human in its workings. The  waterfall is six hundred feet in a short distance. Adjoining this paper  mill was a small munition plant. Most of the employes were women,  dressed in the American bloomer costume.    In the afternoon we had a meeting with the citizens and the Chamber of  Commerce of Grenoble. The discussion took a very wide range--from the  tariff question to the latest news from the front.    Next the party visited a plant for the manufacture of sheet steel by  electricity.    In the evening we were banqueted at the Grand Hotel. On my right sat M.  Paisant, Director General; on my left was Mr. Thomas W. Mutton,  Vice-consul of the United States of America at Grenoble; near was was  Mr. Tenot, Prefect of the district.    This part of France is noted for the amount of cement manufactured.  Walnuts are grown in this section in large quantities. I discussed  these things with Mr. Murton.    There was a discussion at the banquet over female suffrage and the  birthrate, and this grew very animated.    On Friday, September 29th, we left Grenoble and stopped at Voiron and  were here treated, at 9:30 A. M., with a \"petit dejeuner\". We next  visited the monastery Grande. This was founded in the Twelfth century by  St. Bruno. The present building was commenced and completed in the  sixteenth century and the community originally had forty-two monks or  fathers. This monastery is where the celebrated liquor, \"Chartreuse\",  was manufactured, the basis of which is brandy, distilled flowers, and  herbs. This formula was known only to the monks. While at the monastery  in France each monk had an individual garden and an individual cell.  When an extra penance seemed necessary special silence was given them  and they were compelled to remain in their cells for months at a time.  There were long corridors and in the basement places for servants and  retainers. In the center of the grounds was a very beautiful place where  the fathers were buried. We were told that the order was recruited  mainly from the intellectual class, many of them widowers. Special rooms  were reserved for travelers without money and without price.    [Illustration: Monastery of Chartreuse.]    The Carthusian order of Monks established themselves at Grenoble,  France, in 1132. The original receipe for the famous cordial was given  them in 1602 by Marshall d'Estress. Friar Jerome Maubec arranged the  present formula in 1755, and it remained unchanged until their expulsion  by the French Government, July 2nd, 1901. More than two hundred  ingredients go to make up Chartreuse, and nowhere else in the world can  this cordial be manufactured. Chartreuse is the unsolved enigma of  French compounders of liqueurs. Its manufacture has ceased. It is quite  true that at Tarragona, Spain, the monks still continue to make cordial  under the name of \"Peres Chartreux\", but it is generally agreed that,  owing to the change of locality and climate, the \"Peres Chartreux\" now  made there is not equal to the old Chartreuse. There are a number of  people in Grenoble who make imitation Chartreuse, but it is not so good  as the real thing.    The monastery library contained twenty-two thousand volumes. These monks  were also known as the Chartreusers, or Carthusian Monks. This was the  head monastery, but there were branches in Italy, Spain, and Portugal.  The fathers lived on a simple diet and no meat was allowed. They were  not allowed to speak to each other except twice a week, on Sunday and  Thursday. This old monastery is now used as a hospital for  convalescents.    After this most interesting visit we were taken to luncheon at the Hotel  du Grand Som, and later for a ride of one hundred miles in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20467"],[0,"Handbook of the Trees of New England (#13)"],[1,"eastern sections probably introduced.         South to Florida; west to Minnesota, Kansas, Arkansas, and Texas.    =Habit.=--A large tree, 50-75 feet high, with a diameter above the swell  of the roots of 2-5 feet; attaining in the Ohio valley a height of 150  feet and a diameter of 6-8 feet; trunk straight, slowly tapering,  throwing out its lower branches nearly horizontally, the upper at a  broad angle, forming an open, spacious, noble head.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk in old trees thick, blackish, and deeply  furrowed; large branches rough and more or less furrowed; branchlets  smooth; season's twigs downy.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, ovate or rounded, obtuse, more or  less pubescent, few-scaled. Leaves pinnately compound, alternate; rachis  smooth and swollen at base, but less so than that of the butternut;  stipules none; leaflets 13-21 (the odd leaflet at the apex often  wanting), opposite or alternate, 2-5 inches long, about half as wide;  dark green and smooth above, lighter and slightly glandular-pubescent  beneath, turning yellow in autumn; outline ovate-lanceolate; apex  taper-pointed; base oblique, usually rounded or heart-shaped; stemless  or nearly so, except the terminal leaflet; stipels none. Aromatic when  bruised.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Appearing while the leaves are unfolding, sterile  and fertile flowers on the same tree,--the sterile along the sides or at  the ends of the preceding year's branches, in single, unbranched,  green, stout, cylindrical, pendulous catkins, 3-6 inches long; perianth  of 6 rounded lobes, stamens numerous, filaments very short, anthers  purple: fertile flowers in the axils of the season's shoots, sessile,  solitary or several on a common peduncle; calyx 4-toothed, with 4 small  petals at the sinuses; stigmas 2, reddish-green.    =Fruit.=--Ripening in October at the ends of the branchlets, single, or  two or more together; round, smooth, or somewhat roughish with uneven  surface, not viscid, dull green turning to brown: husk not separating  into sections: shell irregularly furrowed: kernel edible.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in central and southern New England; grows  well in most situations, but in a deep rich soil it forms a large and  handsome tree. Readily obtainable in western nurseries; transplants  rather poorly, and collected plants are of little value. Its leaves  appear late and drop early, and the fruit is often abundant. These  disadvantages make it objectionable in many cases. Grown from seed.    [Illustration: PLATE XXIII.--Juglans nigra.]      1. Winter buds.    2. Flowering branch.    3.
