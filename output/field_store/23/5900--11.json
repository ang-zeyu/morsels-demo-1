They that craved your  death did hope that ye would fail at the terrors of the Chapel  Perilous, and that your soul would be lost as have the souls of those  evil or weak knights whose ghosts assailed ye. But by your courage and  great heart ye won through all.'    'This is a great marvel,' said Sir Lancelot, 'and I thank God that He  hath shielded me of His mercy.'    When Sir Lancelot was returned to Camelot, and Merlin had told King  Arthur of the knight's adventures, the king made him one of the knights  of the Round Table.    'Ye do well,' said Merlin privily unto the king, 'for he shall prove  the most man of worship that is in the world, and all your court and  all your Round Table shall be by him made more famous than by any  knight now living. Yet shall he not be one of those three that shall  achieve the Holy Graal.'          IV    THE KNIGHT OF THE KITCHEN      It was the feast of Pentecost, and King Arthur was holding his court of  the Round Table at the city of Kin-Kenadon, hard by the sea in Wales.  In the high hall the tables were set for dinner, and the floor was  freshly strewn with rushes, flowers and fennel, so that the place  smelled as sweet as a field. The cook and his scullions came to and fro  through the door of the kitchen with anxious faces, for they feared  lest the meats should be overdone, but as yet King Arthur would not sit  to dinner. For it was his custom never to go to meat on that day until  he had heard or seen some great marvel or adventure.    Sir Gawaine stood looking from a window in the bower where the king sat  with the queen, and suddenly he turned with a laugh, and said:    'Sir, go to your meat, for here, I think, cometh a strange adventure.'    And even as the king took his seat on the high dais in the hall, and  his knights sat at the Round Table, through the great door of the hall  came two men, well beseen and richly dressed, and, leaning on their  shoulders, was a tall, fair, young man, as goodly to strength and  breadth as ever was seen, with hands large and fair. But he was either  lazy or ill-conditioned, for he leaned upon his fellows as if he were  unable to stand upright. And the three of them marched through the  hall, speaking no word, and they came to the foot of the dais, while  men sat silent and marvelling. Then the young man raised himself  upright, and it was seen that he was a foot and a half taller than  those beside him.    'God bless you, O king!' said the young man, 'and all your fair  fellowship, and in especial the fellowship of the Round Table. I come  to crave of your kindness three gifts, and they are such as ye may  worshipfully and honourably grant unto me. And the first I will ask  now, and the others will I ask at the same day twelvemonths,  wheresoever ye hold your feast of Pentecost.'    'Ask,' said the king, 'and ye shall be granted your petition.'    'The first is this,' said he, 'that ye give me meat and drink and  lodging here for a year.'    'Willingly,' said the king, 'but what is your name and whence come you?  Ye have the bearing of good lineage.'    'That is as may be,' was the reply, 'but I may tell you naught, if it  please you, lord.'    Then King Arthur called Sir Kay, his steward, and bade him tend the  young man for a year as if he were a lord's son.    'There is no need that he should have such care,' sneered Sir Kay, who  was a man of a sour mind. 'I dare swear that he is but a villein born.  If he were of good blood he would have craved a horse and harness. And  since he hath no name I will dub him Beaumains, or Fair Hands, for see  how soft are his hands! And he shall live in the kitchen, and become as  fat as any pig!'    But Sir Lancelot and Sir Gawaine reproached Sir Kay for his mocking of  the young man, 'for,' said Sir Lancelot, 'I dare lay my head he hath  the making of a man of great worship.'    'That cannot be,' said Sir Kay; 'he has asked as his nature prompted  him. He will make naught but fat, for he desires only meat and drink.  On my life I would swear he is only some lazy fellow from an abbey,  where food hath failed, and so he has come hither for sustenance.'    So Kay sat down to his meat laughing, and Beaumains went to the door of  the hall, where the varlets and boys ate the leavings from the table;  but he fared badly there, for they jeered at him as Sir Kay had done.    Afterwards Sir Lancelot, of his great gentleness and courtesy, bade him  come to his chamber, to be better fed and clothed; and Sir Gawaine,  because of a liking he felt in his heart for the young man, proffered  him good meat and drink and a soft bed. But then, and at all other  times, Beaumains refused, and would do nothing but what Sir Kay  commanded.    Thus he lived in the kitchen, eating broken scraps, and lying at night  where the scullions lay, except that he was given the chilliest spot  furthest from the fire. But he did what he was bidden to do with a  cheerful air and was ever willing to work. And if there was any  jousting of knights or any other sights of prowess, these would he see  with the greatest delight. In any sports or trials of strength or skill  among the serving-men, he was ever foremost, and none could overcome  him in wrestling or at quarterstaff, nor could any throw the bar or  cast the stone so far as he could, no, not by two yards.    Whenever Sir Kay met him about the hall or the kitchen he would laugh  mockingly, and to those about him he would say, 'Well, how like you my  huge boy of the kitchen?'    But to such sneers, and to all the scorns and insults of the varlets of  the kitchen, Beaumains would answer naught, and was ever quiet and mild  whatever he endured. And to all was he ever gentle, both man and child,  and he never put forth his great strength in anger.    Thus a year passed, until again it was the feast of Pentecost, and at  that time the king held it at his chief city in Wales, Caerleon-upon-Usk.  And again the feast was royally prepared in the great hall of the  court, but the king would not give the signal to sit to meat until he  should have heard or seen some strange adventure.    But about noon a squire came to where the king waited, and said, 'Lord,  I am bidden to say ye may go to your meat, for there cometh a damsel  with some strange adventure.'    Quickly the king sat on the high seat, and the cooks brought in the  smoking collops of meat and the dishes of savoury stews. And as they  began to eat, there came a maiden of a plain sharp visage, who made her  way to the step of the dais, and there kneeling, cried:    'Succour and help I crave of you, O king!'    'For whom?' said the king, 'and for what reason?'    'Sir,' said the maiden, 'my lady sister is of great beauty and renown,  and is besieged in her castle by a tyrant-knight, who will not let her  go forth from her castle; and because it is said that here in your  court are the noblest knights in all the world, I come to you praying  for aid.'    'What is your lady sister's name?' asked the king, 'and where doth she  dwell, and tell me who is he that doth besiege her?'    'Sir king,' said the lady, 'I may not tell you my sister's name, but  she is of great beauty and of wide lands. And the tyrant-knight who  besieges her is the Red Knight of Reedlands.'    'I know him not,' replied the king.    'Sir,' cried Sir Gawaine from his seat, 'I know him well. He is one of  the perilous knights of the world, for he hath the strength of seven  men, and from him I once escaped barely with my life.'    'Fair lady,' said the king, 'I would help you willingly, but as ye will  not tell me your lady's name, none of my knights here shall go with you  with my consent.'    The damsel looked about the hall with a quick angry glance, and the  knights that sat there liked not her sour looks. Then from the crowd of  scullions and kitchen lads that hung about the serving-tables at the  side of the hall came Beaumains, his dress smirched, but his handsome  face lit up and his eyes burning with eagerness.    'Sir king!' he cried, holding up his hand, 'a boon I crave!'    As he came to the step of the dais the damsel shrank from him as if he  had been something foul.    'Say on,' replied the king to the young man.    'God thank you, my king,' went on Beaumains. 'I have been these twelve  months in your kitchen, and have had my full living, as ye did  graciously order, and now I ask for the two further gifts ye promised.'    'Ye have but to ask,' replied the king.    'Sir, they are these,' said Beaumains. 'First, that you will grant me  this adventure of the damsel.'    'I grant it you,' said King Arthur.    'Then, sir, this is the other,--that ye shall bid Sir Lancelot du Lake  to follow me, and to make me a knight when I shall desire him.'    'All this shall be done if Sir Lancelot think it well,' said the king.    But the lady was exceedingly wroth, and her eyes flashed with scorn as  she turned to the king:    'Shame on thee!' she cried; 'will you give me a kitchen scullion to aid  me?'    With that she hastened from the hall, mounted her horse and rode away.  Even as she went forth, a dwarf in the dress of a page entered the hall  leading a great horse richly caparisoned, and on the saddle was piled a  splendid suit of armour. And the dwarf went up to Beaumains and began  to arm him, while men asked each other whence came all this fine gear.    When he was dressed in armour, all the knights marvelled to see how  goodly a man he looked. Then Beaumains took leave of King Arthur and of  Sir Gawaine, and asked Sir Lancelot to follow him.    Many people went to the door of the hall to see Beaumains mount his  horse and ride after the damsel, and the way he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#13)"],[1,"        He looks as pale as the visard of the ghost which cries so       miserably at the Theatre, like an oyster-wife, \"Hamlet,       revenge!\"    And here, too, they presented all of Shakespeare's early masterpieces.    Their connection with the building ceased in 1597 at the expiration of  the Burbage lease; but their association with the proprietors of the  Theatre was permanent. Their subsequent history, as also the history  of the Burbage brothers, will be found in the chapters dealing with  the Globe and the Second Blackfriars.[105]    [Footnote 105: For other but unimportant references to the Theatre see  The Malone Society's _Collections_, vol. I: disorder at, October,  1577, p. 153; disorder at, on Sunday, April, 1580, p. 46; fencing  allowed at, July, 1582, p. 57; fencing forbidden at, May, 1583, p. 62;  to be closed during infection, May, 1583, p. 63; complaint against, by  the Lord Mayor, September, 1594, p. 76. And see Halliwell-Phillipps,  _Outlines_, I, 363, for a special performance there by a \"virgin,\"  February 22, 1582.]          CHAPTER IV    THE CURTAIN      Although James Burbage was, as his son asserted, \"the first builder of  playhouses,\" a second public playhouse followed hard on the Theatre,  probably within twelve months. It was erected a short distance to the  south of the Theatre,--that is, nearer the city,--and, like that  building, it adjoined Finsbury Field.[106] To the two playhouses the  audiences came trooping over the meadows, in \"great multidudes,\" the  Lord Mayor tells us; and the author of _Tarlton's Newes out of  Purgatory_ (_c._ 1589) describes their return to London thus: \"With  that I waked, and saw such concourse of people through the fields that  I knew the play was done.\"[107]    [Footnote 106: The site is probably marked by Curtain Court in  Chasserau's survey of 1745, reproduced on page 79.]    [Footnote 107: Ed. by J.O. Halliwell, for The Shakespeare Society  (1844), p. 105.]    The new playhouse derived its name from the Curtain estate, on which  it was erected.[108] This estate was formerly the property of the  Priory of Holywell, and was described in 1538 as \"scituata et  existentia extra portas ejusdem nuper monasterii prope pasturam dicte  nuper Priorisse, vocatam _the Curteine_.\"[109] Why it was so called  is not clear. The name may have been derived from some previous owner  of the property; it may, as Collier thought, have come from some early  association with the walls (_curtains_) or defenses of the city; or,  it may have come, as Tomlins suggests, from the mediaeval Latin  _cortina_, meaning a court, a close, a farm enclosure.[110] Whatever  its origin--the last explanation seems the most plausible--the  interesting point is that it had no connection whatever with a stage  curtain.    [Footnote 108: The Rose and the Red Bull derived their names in a  similar way from the estates on which they were erected.]    [Footnote 109: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 364.]    [Footnote 110: Tomlins, _Origin of the Curtain Theatre, and Mistakes  Regarding It_, in The Shakespeare Society's Papers (1844), p. 29.]    The building was probably opened to the London public in the summer or  autumn of 1577. The first reference to it is found in T[homas]  W[hite]'s _Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse on Sunday the Thirde of  November, 1577_: \"Behold the sumptuous theatre houses, a continual  monument of London's prodigality and folly\";[111] and a reference to  it by name appears in Northbrooke's _A Treatise_, licensed December,  1577: \"Those places, also, which are made up and builded for such  plays and interludes, as the Theatre and Curtain.\"[112]    [Footnote 111: J.D. Wilson, _The Cambridge History of English  Literature_, VI, 435, says that this sermon was \"delivered at Paul's  cross on 9 December, 1576 and, apparently, repeated on 3 November in  the following year.\" This is incorrect; White did preach a sermon at  Paul's Cross on December 9, but not the sermon from which this  quotation is drawn.]    [Footnote 112: Ed. by J.P. Collier, for The Shakespeare Society  (1843), p. 85.]    Like the Theatre, the Curtain was a peculiarly shaped building,  specially designed for acting; \"those playhouses that are erected and  built _only for such purposes_ ... namely the Curtain and the  Theatre,\"[113] writes the Privy Council; and the German traveler,  Samuel Kiechel, who visited London in 1585, describes them as  \"_sonderbare_\" structures. They are usually mentioned together, and in  such a way as to suggest similarity of shape as well as of purpose. We  may, I think, reasonably suppose that the Curtain was in all essential  details a copy of Burbage's Theatre.[114] Presumably, then, it was  polygonal (or circular) in shape,[115] was constructed of timber, and  was finished on the outside with lime and plaster. The interior, as  the evidence already cited in the chapter on the Theatre shows,  consisted of three galleries surrounding an open yard. There was a  platform projecting into the middle of the yard, with dressing-rooms  at the rear, \"heavens\" overhead, and a flagpole rising above the  \"heavens.\" That some sign was displayed in front of the door is  likely. Malone writes: \"The original sign hung out at this playhouse  (as Mr. Steevens has observed) was the painting of a curtain  striped.\"[116] Aubrey records that Ben Jonson \"acted and wrote, but  both ill, at the Green Curtain, a kind of nursery or obscure playhouse  somewhere in the suburbs, I think towards Shoreditch or  Clerkenwell.\"[117] By \"at the Green Curtain\" Aubrey means, of course,  \"at the sign of the Green Curtain\"; but the evidence of Steevens and  of Aubrey is too vague and uncertain to warrant any definite  conclusions.    [Footnote 113: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVII, 313.]    [Footnote 114: It seems, however, to have been smaller than the  Theatre.]    [Footnote 115: Johannes de Witt describes the Theatre and the Curtain  along with the Swan and the Rose as \"amphitheatra\" (see page 167). It  is quite possible that Shakespeare refers to the Curtain in the  Prologue to _Henry V_ as \"this wooden O,\" though the reference may be  to the Globe.]    [Footnote 116: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 54; cf. also Ellis, _The  Parish of St. Leonard_.]    [Footnote 117: Did Steevens base his statement on this passage in  Aubrey?]    Of the early history of the Curtain we know little, mainly because it  was not, like certain other playhouses, the subject of extensive  litigation. We do not even know who planned and built it. The first  evidence of its ownership appears fifteen years after its erection, in  some legal documents connected with the Theatre.[118] In July, 1592,  Henry Lanman, described as \"of London, gentleman, of the age of 54  years,\" deposed: \"That true it is about 7 years now shall be this next  winter, they, the said Burbage and Brayne, having the profits of plays  made at the Theatre, and this deponent having the profits of the plays  done at the house called the Curtain near to the same, the said  Burbage and Brayne, taking the Curtain as an esore[119] to their  playhouse, did of their own motion move this deponent that he would  agree that the profits of the said two playhouses might for seven  years space be in divident between them.\"[120]    [Footnote 118: Brayne _v._ Burbage, 1592, printed in full by Wallace,  _The First London Theatre_, pp. 109-52. See especially pp. 126, 148.]    [Footnote 119: Easer?]    [Footnote 120: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 148; cf. p. 126.]    [Illustration: THE SITE OF THE CURTAIN PLAYHOUSE    From _An Actual Survey of the Parish of St Leonard in Shoreditch taken  in the year 1745_ by Peter Chasserau, Surveyor. The key to the map  gives \"93\" as Curtain Court, probably the site of the old playhouse,  \"87\" as New Inn Yard, and \"94\" as Holywell Court, both interesting in  connection with Burbage's Theatre. (Redrawn from the original for this  volume.)]    From this statement it is evident that Henry Lanman was the sole  proprietor of the Curtain as far back as 1585, and the presumption is  that his proprietorship was of still earlier date. This presumption is  strengthened by the fact that in a sale of the Curtain estate early in  1582, he is specifically mentioned as having a tenure of an \"edifice  or building\" erected in the Curtain Close, that is, that section of  the estate next to the Field, on which the playhouse was built.[121]  Since Lanman is not mentioned as having any other property on the  estate, the \"edifice or building\" referred to was probably the  playhouse. The document gives no indication as to how long he had held  possession of the \"edifice,\" but the date of sale, March, 1582,  carries us back to within four years of the erection of the Curtain,  and it seems reasonable to suppose, though of course we cannot be  sure, that Lanman had been proprietor of the building from the very  beginning.[122]    [Footnote 121: Tomlins, _op. cit._, pp. 29-31.]    [Footnote 122: Of this Henry Lanman we know nothing beyond the facts  here revealed. Possibly he was a brother of the distinguished actor  John Lanman (the name is variously spelled Lanman, Laneman, Lenmann,  Laneham, Laynman, Lanham), one of the chief members of Leicester's  troupe, and one of the twelve men selected in 1583 to form the Queen's  Men. But speculation of this sort is vain. It is to be hoped that in  the future some student will investigate the life of this obscure  theatrical manager, and trace his connection with the early history of  the drama.]    Certain records of the sale of the Curtain estate shortly before and  shortly after the erection of the playhouse are preserved, but these  throw very little light upon the playhouse itself. We learn that on  February 20, 1567, Lord Mountjoy and his wife sold the estate to  Maurice Longe, clothworker, and his son William Longe, for the sum of  L60; and that on August 23, 1571, Maurice Longe and his wife sold it  to the then Lord"]]]
