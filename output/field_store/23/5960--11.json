But after the lapse of a month Vajramukut, who had eaten and drunk and  slept a great deal too much, and who had not once hunted, became bilious  in body and in mind melancholic. His face turned yellow, and so did  the whites of his eyes; he yawned, as liver patients generally do,  complained occasionally of sick headaches, and lost his appetite:  he became restless and anxious, and once when alone at night he thus  thought aloud: \"I have given up country, throne, home, and everything  else, but the friend by means of whom this happiness was obtained I  have not seen for the long length of thirty days. What will he say to  himself, and how can I know what has happened to him?\"    In this state of things he was sitting, and in the meantime the  beautiful princess arrived. She saw through the matter, and lost not a  moment in entering upon it. She began by expressing her astonishment at  her lover's fickleness and fondness for change, and when he was ready  to wax wroth, and quoted the words of the sage, \"A barren wife may be  superseded by another in the eighth year; she whose children all die, in  the tenth; she who brings forth only daughters, in the eleventh; she  who scolds, without delay,\" thinking that she alluded to his love, she  smoothed his temper by explaining that she referred to his forgetting  his friend. \"How is it possible, O my soul,\" she asked with the softest  of voices, that thou canst happiness here whilst thy heart is wandering  there? Why didst thou conceal this from me, O astute one? Was it for  fear of distressing me? Think better of thy wife than to suppose that  she would ever separate thee from one to whom we both owe so much!    After this Padmavati advised, nay ordered, her lover to go forth that  night, and not to return till his mind was quite at ease, and she begged  him to take a few sweetmeats and other trifles as a little token of her  admiration and regard for the clever young man of whom she had heard so  much.    Vajramukut embraced her with a transport of gratitude, which so inflamed  her anger, that fearing lest the cloak of concealment might fall from  her countenance, she went away hurriedly to find the greatest delicacies  which her comfit boxes contained. Presently she returned, carrying a bag  of sweetmeats of every kind for her lover, and as he rose up to depart,  she put into his hand a little parcel of sugar-plums especially intended  for the friend; they were made up with her own delicate fingers, and  they would please, she flattered herself, even his discriminating  palate.    The young prince, after enduring a number of farewell embraces and  hopings for a speedy return, and last words ever beginning again,  passed safely through the palace gate, and with a relieved aspect walked  briskly to the house of the old nurse. Although it was midnight his  friend was still sitting on his mat.    The two young men fell upon one another's bosoms and embraced  affectionately. They then began to talk of matters nearest their hearts.  The Raja's son wondered at seeing the jaded and haggard looks of his  companion, who did not disguise that they were caused by his anxiety as  to what might have happened to his friend at the hand of so talented and  so superior a princess. Upon which Vajramukut, who now thought Padmavati  an angel, and his late abode a heaven, remarked with formality--and two  blunders to one quotation--that abilities properly directed win for a  man the happiness of both worlds.    The pradhan's son rolled his head.    \"Again on your hobby-horse, nagging at talent whenever you find it in  others!\" cried the young prince with a pun, which would have delighted  Padmavati. \"Surely you are jealous of her!\" he resumed, anything but  pleased with the dead silence that had received his joke; \"jealous of  her cleverness, and of her love for me. She is the very best creature  in the world. Even you, woman-hater as you are, would own it if you only  knew all the kind messages she sent, and the little pleasant surprise  that she has prepared for you. There! take and eat; they are made by her  own dear hands!\" cried the young Raja, producing the sweetmeats. \"As she  herself taught me to say--             Thank God I am a man,       Not a philosopher!\"    \"The kind messages she sent me! The pleasant surprise she has prepared  for me!\" repeated the minister's son in a hard, dry tone. \"My lord will  be pleased to tell me how she heard of my name?\"    \"I was sitting one night,\" replied the prince, \"in anxious thought about  you, when at that moment the princess coming in and seeing my condition,  asked, 'Why are you thus sad? Explain the cause to me.' I then gave  her an account of your cleverness, and when she heard it she gave me  permission to go and see you, and sent these sweetmeats for you: eat  them and I shall be pleased.\"    \"Great king!\" rejoined the young statesman, \"one thing vouchsafe to  hear from me. You have not done well in that you have told my name.  You should never let a woman think that your left hand knows the secret  which she confided to your right, much less that you have shared it to  a third person. Secondly, you did evil in allowing her to see the  affection with which you honour your unworthy servant--a woman ever  hates her lover's or husband's friend.\"    \"What could I do?\" rejoined the young Raja, in a querulous tone of  voice. \"When I love a woman I like to tell her everything--to have no  secrets from her--to consider her another self----\"    \"Which habit,\" interrupted the pradhan's son, \"you will lose when you  are a little older, when you recognize the fact that love is nothing but  a bout, a game of skill between two individuals of opposite sexes: the  one seeking to gain as much, and the other striving to lose as little as  possible; and that the sharper of the twain thus met on the chessboard  must, in the long run, win. And reticence is but a habit. Practise it  for a year, and you will find it harder to betray than to conceal your  thoughts. It hath its joy also. Is there no pleasure, think you, when  suppressing an outbreak of tender but fatal confidence in saying to  yourself, 'O, if she only knew this?' 'O, if she did but suspect that?'  Returning, however, to the sugar-plums, my life to a pariah's that they  are poisoned!\"    \"Impossible!\" exclaimed the prince, horror-struck at the thought;  \"what you say, surely no one ever could do. If a mortal fears not his  fellow-mortal, at least he dreads the Deity.\"    \"I never yet knew,\" rejoined the other, \"what a woman in love does fear.  However, prince, the trial is easy. Come here, Muti!\" cried he to the  old woman's dog, \"and off with thee to that three-headed kinsman of  thine, that attends upon his amiable-looking master.[67]\"    Having said this, he threw one of the sweetmeats to the dog; the animal  ate it, and presently writhing and falling down, died.    \"The wretch! O the wretch!\" cried Vajramukut, transported with wonder  and anger. \"And I loved her! But now it is all over. I dare not  associate with such a calamity!\"    \"What has happened, my lord, has happened!\" quoth the minister's son  calmly. \"I was prepared for something of this kind from so talented a  princess. None commit such mistakes, such blunders, such follies as your  clever women; they cannot even turn out a crime decently executed. O  give me dulness with one idea, one aim, one desire. O thrice blessed  dulness that combines with happiness, power.\"    This time Vajramukut did not defend talent.    \"And your slave did his best to warn you against perfidy. But now my  heart is at rest. I have tried her strength. She has attempted and  failed; the defeat will prevent her attempting again--just yet. But let  me ask you to put to yourself one question. Can you be happy without  her?\"    \"Brother!\" replied the prince, after a pause, \"I cannot\"; and he blushed  as he made the avowal.    \"Well,\" replied the other, \"better confess then conceal that fact;  we must now meet her on the battle-field, and beat her at her own  weapons--cunning. I do not willingly begin treachery with women,  because, in the first place, I don't like it; and secondly, I know that  they will certainly commence practicing it upon me, after which I hold  myself justified in deceiving them. And probably this will be a good  wife; remember that she intended to poison me, not you. During the last  month my fear has been lest my prince had run into the tiger's brake.  Tell me, my lord, when does the princess expect you to return to her?\"    \"She bade me,\" said the young Raja, \"not to return till my mind was  quite at ease upon the subject of my talented friend.\"    \"This means that she expects you back to-morrow night, as you cannot  enter the palace before. And now I will retire to my cot, as it is there  that I am wont to ponder over my plans.

The investigations about idiotic and defective children are by no means  satisfactory, and are considered by some of the most careful writers as  not at all proving a greater tendency to such misfortunes in the  offspring of cousins. Among a thousand idiotic children recently  examined in Paris, not one was descended from a healthy consanguinity.    But as few families are wholly without some lurking predisposition to  disease, it is not well, as a rule, to run the risk of developing this  by too repeated unions. Stock-breeders find that the best specimens of  the lower animals are produced by crossing nearly-related individuals a  certain number of times; but that, carried beyond this, such unions lead  to degeneracy and sterility. Such, also, has been the experience of many  human families.    How slight a cause even of that most insidious disease, consumption,  such marriages are, may be judged from the fact, that of a thousand  cases inquired into by Dr. Edward Smith, in only six was there  consanguinity of parents.      THE MIXTURE OF RACES.    Mankind, say the school geographies, is divided into five races, each  distinguished by its own color. They are the white, the black, the red,  the yellow, and the brown races. In this country, practically, we have  to do with but the white and black races; and the question is constantly  asked, Shall we approve of marriages between them? Shall a white woman  choose a black man to be her husband?    We are at the more pains to answer this, because recently a writer--and  this writer a woman, and this woman one of the most widely known in our  land--has written a novel intended to advocate the affirmative of this  question. Moreover, it is constantly mooted in certain political  circles, and is one of the social problems of the day.    The very fact that it is so much discussed, shows that such a union runs  counter to a strong prejudice. Such aversions are often voices of  nature, acting as warnings against acts injurious to the species. In  this instance it is not of modern origin, created by peculiar  institutions. Three centuries ago, Shakspeare, who had probably never  seen a score of negroes in his life, with the divination of genius, felt  the repugnance which a refined woman would feel to accepting one as her  husband. The plot of one of his plays turns on it. He makes Iago say of  Desdemona:        'Not to affect many proposed matches      Of her own clime, complexion, and degree;      Whereto, we see, in all things nature tends:      Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,      Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural.'    It is, indeed, 'nature erring from itself' which prompts to these  marriages. They are not sterile, but the children are sickly and  short-lived. Very few mulattoes reach an old age.    Then it is well known that the black race cannot survive a northern  climate. Dr. Snow, of Providence, Rhode Island, who has given great  attention to the study of statistics, says emphatically that, in New  England, the colored population inevitably perish in a few generations,  if left to themselves. This debility no woman should wish to give to  her children.    A mental inferiority is likewise apparent. Friends of the negro are  ready to confess this, but attribute it to his long and recent period of  servitude. We deal with facts only. The inferiority is there, whatever  be its cause; and she who would willingly curse her offspring with it,  manifests indeed 'thoughts unnatural.'    The children born of a union of the black and red race, negroes and  Indians, are on the contrary, remarkable for their physical vigor and  mental acuteness; though, of course, the latter is limited to the  demands of a semi-barbarous life.      SHOULD NATIVE WOMEN MARRY FOREIGNERS?    When we narrow the question of race to that of nationality, entirely new  elements come in.    In speaking of the intermarriage of relatives, we showed that a certain  number of such unions in healthy stocks was advantageous rather than  otherwise, but that too many of them lead to deterioration. This law can  be applied to nations. Historians have often observed that the most  powerful states of the world arose from an amalgamation of different  tribes. Rome, Greece, England, are examples of this. On the other hand,  France, Russia, Spain, China, Persia, which have suffered no such  crosses of blood, are either stationary, or depend for their progress on  foreigners.    Physicians have contributed other curious testimony on this point, the  bearing of which they themselves have not understood. Marriages between  nationalities of the same race are more fertile, and the children more  vigorous, than those between descendants of the same nation. For  instance, it has been proved that if two descendants of the Pilgrim  Fathers in Massachusetts marry, they will probably have but three  children; while, if one of them marries a foreigner, the children will  number five or six.    So it is well ascertained that in the old and stationary communes of  France, where the same families have possessed their small farms for  generation after generation, the marriages have become gradually less  and less productive, until it has seriously interfered with the quota  those districts send to the army.    American women have suffered many hard words because they do not have  more children. Several New England writers have accused them of very bad  practices, which we shall mention hereafter. But the effect of the law  of production just now laid down has been quite overlooked.    As it is best that there should be four or five children in a family in  ordinary circumstances, the union of American and foreign blood is very  desirable. We need to fuse in one the diverse colonies of the white race  annually reaching our shores. A century should efface every trace of the  German, the Irish, the Frenchman, the English, the Norwegian, and leave  nothing but the American. To bring about this happy result, free  intermarriage should be furthered in every possible way.      THE AGE OF THE HUSBAND.    The epoch of puberty comes to a boy at about the same age as it does to  a girl,--fourteen or fifteen years. And an even greater period passes  between this epoch and the age it is proper for a man to marry,--his age  of nubility.    Not only has he a more complete education to obtain, not only a  profession or trade to learn, and some property to accumulate, some  position to acquire, ere he is ready to take a wife, but his physical  powers ripen more slowly than those of woman. He is more tardy in  completing his growth, and early indulgence more readily saps his  constitution.    We have placed the best age for woman to marry between twenty and  twenty-five years; for similar reasons, man is best qualified to become  a husband between twenty-three and thirty-three years.    Previous to the twenty-third year, many a man is incapable of producing  healthy children. If he does not destroy his health by premature  indulgence, he may destroy his happiness by witnessing his children a  prey to debility and deformity. An old German proverb says, 'Give a boy  a wife, and a child a bird, and death will soon knock at the door.' Even  an author so old as Aristotle warns young men against early marriage,  under penalty of disease and puny offspring.    From the age of thirty-three to fifty years, men who carefully observe  the laws of health do not feel any weight of years. Nevertheless, they  are past their prime. Then, also, with advancing years, the chances of  life diminish, and the probability increases that they will leave a  young family with no natural protector. The half-century once turned,  their vigor rapidly diminishes. The marriages they then contract are  either sterile, or yield but few and sickly children. Many an old man  has shortened his life by late nuptials; and the records of medicine  contain accounts of several who perished on the very night of marriage.    The relative age of man and wife is next to be considered. Nature fits  woman earlier for marriage, and hints thereby that she should, as a  rule, be younger than her husband. So, too, the bard of nature speaks:                  'Let still the woman take      An elder than herself; so wears she to him,      So sways she level in her husband's heart.'    The woman who risks her happiness with a man many years younger than  herself, violates a precept of life; and when her husband grows  indifferent, or taunts her with her years, or seeks companions of more  suitable age, she is reaping a harvest sown by her own hand.    So commonly do such matches turn out badly, that in 1828 the kingdom of  Wuertemberg prohibited unions where the woman was more than twelve years  the senior, except by special dispensation.    After forty-five years, most women cannot hope for children. A marriage  subsequent to this period can at best be regarded as a close friendship.  Marriage in its full meaning has no longer an existence.    The relative age of man and wife has another influence, and quite a  curious one. It influences the sex of the children. But this point we  reserve for discussion on a later page.    The folly of joining a young girl to an old man is happily not so common  in America as in Europe. It would be hard to devise any step more  certain to bring the laws of nature and morality into conflict.        'What can a young lassie do wi' an auld man?'    What advice can we give to a woman who barters her youthful charms for  the fortune of an aged husband? Shall we be cynical enough to agree with  'auld Auntie Katie?'        'My auld Auntie Katie upon me takes pity;        I'll do my endeavor to follow her plan:      I'll cross him, and rack him, until I heart-break him,        And then his "]]]
