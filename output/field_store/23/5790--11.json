[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#13)"],[1," He finds what he thinks the           oldest representation of sepulchral ornament in a black-figured           vase of the so-called \"prothesis\" class.[59] Here are two women           weeping about a sepulchral mound on which rests an amphora of           like form to the one that bears the scene. He maintains then           that such a prothesis vase was the first sepulchral monument,           that this was later replaced by a vase of the same description           in marble, of course on account of the fragile nature of           pottery. For this reason, too, we find no certain proof of the           fact in the old tombs, though Dr. Wolters[60] thinks that the           discovery of fragments of vases on undisturbed tombs makes the           case a very strong one. The use of such vases or urns of marble           for this purpose became very prevalent. They are nearly always           without ornament, save for a single small group, in relief or           sometimes in color, representing the dead and the bereaved           ones. A very evident connecting-link between these urns and the           later sepulchral stele appears in monuments which show just           such urns projected in relief upon a plane surface. The relief           is sometimes bounded by the outlines of the urn itself,[61]           sometimes a surrounding background is indicated. In many cases           this background assumes the form of the ordinary sepulchral           stele. The Central Museum at Athens is especially rich in           examples of this kind. On two steles which I have noticed           there, three urns are represented side by side. A still more           interesting specimen is a stone so divided that its lower part           is occupied by an urn in relief, above which is sculptured the  Page 38  usual scene of parting. This scene has its normal place as a           relief or a drawing in color on the surface of the urn itself;           here, where the step in advance of choosing the plane stele to           bear the relief seems already taken, the strength of tradition           still asserts itself, and a similar group is repeated on the           rounded face of the urn below. The transition to the more           common form of sepulchral monument has now become easy; but the           characteristics which point to its genesis in the funeral vase           are still prominent.             [Footnote 58: _Mitth. Athen._, v, 164.]             [Footnote 59: _Monumenti dell' Inst._, viii, _tav._ v. 1.           _g.h._: found near Cape Kolias; at present in the Polytechnic           Museum at Athens.]             [Footnote 60: _Attische Grabvasen_, a paper read before the           German Institute in Athens, Dec. 9, 1890.]             [Footnote 61: Examples are Nos. 2099 and 2100 in the archaic           room of the Louvre. I remember having seen nothing similar in           any other European museum.]             This process of development, so far as can be judged from           existing types, reaches down to the beginning of the fourth           century B.C. Steles of a different class are found, dating from           a period long before this. Instead of a group, they bear only           the dead man in a way to suggest his position, or vocation           during life. All show distinctly a clinging to the technic of           ceramic art. Sculptured steles and others merely painted exist           side by side. The best known of the latter class is the Lyseas           stele, in the Central Museum at Athens. Many more of the same           sort have been discovered, differing from their vase           predecessors in material and form, but keeping to the old           principles. The outlines, for example, are first incised, and           then the picture is finished with color. The Aristion stele may           be taken as an example of the second order. Relief plays here           the leading part; but it must still be assisted by painting,           while the resemblance to vase-figures in position, arrangement           of clothing, proportion and profile, remains as close as in the           simply painted stele. An ever present feature, also, is the           palmette acroterium, treated in conventional ceramic style.           Loeschke thinks that the origin of red-figured pottery is to be           found in the dark ground and light coloring of these steles.           Whether the opinion be correct or not, it points to a very           close connection between the two forms of art.             The influence of ceramic decoration spread still further. Large           numbers of steles and bases for votive offerings have been           discovered on the Acropolis, which alike repeat over and over           again conventional vase-patterns, and show the use of incised           lines and other peculiarities of the technic of pottery.[62]             [Footnote 62: BORRMANN, _Jahrbuch des Instituts_, III, 274.]             As to specific resemblances between the pediments of the           Acropolis and vase-pictures, the subjects of all the groups are  Page 39  such as appear very frequently on vases of all periods. About           seventy Attic vases are known which deal with the contest of           Herakles and Triton. One of these is a hydria at present in the           Berlin Museum, No. 1906.[63] Herakles is represented astride           the Triton, and he clasps him with both arms as in the           Acropolis group. The Triton's scaly length, his fins and tail,           are drawn in quite the same way. It is very noticeable that on           the vase the contortions of the Triton's body seem much more           violent; here the sculptor could not well follow the           vase-painter so closely. It was far easier for him to work out           the figure in milder curves; but he followed the vase-type as           closely as possible. On the other hand, if the potter had           copied the pedimental group the copy could perfectly well have           been an exact one. The group is very similar also to a scene in           the Assos frieze, with regard to which I quote from           Friedrichs-Wolters;[64] \"It corresponds to the oldest Greek           vase-paintings, in which we find beast fights borrowed from           Oriental art, united with Greek myths and represented after the           Greek manner.\" This frieze is ascribed to the sixth century           B.C., and is not much later than our pediments.             For the Hydra pediment, there exists a still closer parallel,           in an archaic Corinthian amphora, published by Gerhard.[65]           Athena appears here as a spectator, though she has no part in           the pedimental group; but in every other point, in the drawing           of the Hydra, of Herakles and Iolaos, the identity is almost           complete. Athena seems to have been omitted, because the artist           found it difficult to introduce another figure in the narrow           space. Evidently the vase must have represented a type known to           the sculptor and copied by him.             [Footnote 63: Published by GERHARD, _Auserlesene griechische           Vasenbilder_, No. 111; RAYET et COLLIGNON, _Hist. Céram.           Grecque_. fig. 57, p. 125. In the National Museum at Naples,           No. 3419, is a black-figured amphora which repeats the same           scene. The drawing and position of the two contestants is just           as on the Berlin vase, the Triton seeking with one hand to           break Herakles' hold about his neck, while with the other he           holds a fish as attribute. Athena stands close by, watching the           struggle.]             [Footnote 64: _Gipsabgüsse antiker Bildwerke_, Nos. 8-12.]             [Footnote 65: _Auserlesene Vasenbilder_, Nos. 95, 96.]             For the Typhon pediment, no such close analogies are possible,           at least in the form and arrangement of figures. It would seem           that this is so simply because no vase-picture of this subject  Page 40  that we know so far answers the conditions of a pedimental           group that it could be used as a pattern. In matters of detail,           a hydria in Munich, No. 125,[66] offers the best illustration.           For example, the vase-painting and the relief show quite the           same treatment of hair, beard and wings in the figure of           Typhon.             Speaking more generally, we find continually in the pediments           reminiscences of ceramic drawing and treatment. The acroteria,           painted in black and red on the natural surface of poros stone,           take the shape of palmettes and lotuses. The cornices above and           below are of clay or poros, painted in just such designs as           appear on the Olympian terracottas; and these designs are           frequently repeated in the sculptures themselves. The feathers           of Typhon's wings are conventionally represented by a           scale-pattern; the arc of the scales has been drawn with           compass; we observe still the hole left in the centre by the           leg of the compass. The larger pinions at the ends of the wings           have been outlined, regularly by incised lines, and then filled           up with color. All this is as like the treatment of           vase-figures, as it unlike anything else in plastic art. In the           former the scale-pattern is used conventionally to denote           almost anything. Fragments of vases found on the Acropolis           itself picture wings in just this way; or it may be Athena's           aegis, the fleece of a sheep or the earth's surface that is so           represented. On the body of the Triton and the Echidna of the           pediments no attempt is made to indicate movement and           contortion by the position of the scales; it is everywhere the           lifeless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#13)"],[1,"8 July 1989);  Vice President Carlos RUCKAUF (since 8 July 1995); note-the president  is both the chief of state and head of government  cabinet: Cabinet appointed by the president  elections: president and vice president elected on the same ticket by  popular vote for four-year terms; election last held 14 May 1995 (next  to be held 1999)  election results: Carlos Saul MENEM reelected president; percent of  vote-NA    Legislative branch: bicameral National Congress or Congreso Nacional  consists of the Senate (72 seats; formerly, three members appointed by  each of the provincial legislatures; presently transitioning to  one-third of the members being elected every three years to a  nine-year term) and the Chamber of Deputies (257 seats; one-half of  the members elected every two years to four-year terms)  elections: Senate-last held NA May 1995 (next to be held NA 1998);  Chamber of Deputies-last held 26 October 1997 (next to be held NA  1999)  election results: Senate-percent of vote by party-NA; seats by  party-PJ 39, UCR 1, others 32; Chamber of Deputies-percent of vote by  party-NA; seats by party-PJ 119, UCR 69, Frepaso 36, other 33    Judicial branch: Supreme Court (Corte Suprema), the nine Supreme Court  judges are appointed by the president with approval of the Senate    Political parties and leaders: Justicialist Party or PJ [Carlos Saul  MENEM] (Peronist umbrella political organization); Radical Civic Union  or UCR [Fernando DE LA RUA]; Union of the Democratic Center or UCD  (conservative party); Dignity and Independence Political Party or  MODIN (right-wing party); Front for a Country in Solidarity or Frepaso  (a four party coalition) [leader Carlos ALVAREZ]; Action for the  Republic [Domingo CAVALLO]; New Leadership [Gustavo BELIZ]; several  provincial parties    Political pressure groups and leaders: Peronist-dominated labor  movement; General Confederation of Labor or CGT (Peronist-leaning  umbrella labor organization); Argentine Industrial Union  (manufacturers' association); Argentine Rural Society (large  landowners' association); Argentine Association of Pharmaceutical Labs  (CILFA); business organizations; students; the Roman Catholic Church;  the Armed Forces    International organization participation: AfDB, AG (observer),  Australia Group, BCIE, CCC, ECLAC, FAO, G- 6, G-11, G-15, G-19, G-24,  G-77, IADB, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS,  IHO, ILO, IMF, IMO, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU,  LAES, LAIA, Mercosur, MINUGUA, MINURSO, MIPONUH, MTCR, NSG (observer),  OAS, OPANAL, PCA, RG, UN, UNAVEM III, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNFICYP, UNHCR,  UNIDO, UNIKOM, UNITAR, UNMIBH, UNMOP, UNPREDEP, UNTSO, UNU, UPU, WCL,  WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTrO    Diplomatic representation in the US:  chief of mission: Ambassador Diego Ramiro GUELAR  chancery: 1600 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20009  telephone: [1] (202) 939-6400 through 6403  FAX: [1] (202) 332-3171  consulate(s) general: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami,  New York, San Francisco, and San Juan (Puerto Rico)    Diplomatic representation from the US:  chief of mission: Ambassador James R.

Nevertheless, following decades of  mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was  plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of  hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President  MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program  that has put Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth.  Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April  1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years.  Argentines have responded to price stability by repatriating capital  and investing in domestic industry. Growth averaged more than 8%  between 1991 and 1994, then fell 4.6% in 1995, largely in reaction to  the Mexican peso crisis. The economy has since recovered strongly.  However, unemployment remains nearly 14%, and Buenos Aires still  depends on foreign capital to meet the bulk of its financing needs.  The IMF has urged additional economic reforms to ensure equitable  long-term growth.    GDP: purchasing power parity-$348.2 billion (1997 est.)    GDP-real growth rate: 8.4% (1997 est.)
