Rembrandt never allows  his lights, even though comparatively cool, to pass into the shadow  without a few touches of warm colour; this was the practice of Rubens,  to enrich, as it were, \"the debateable land.\" When this principle of  painting candlelight subjects fell into the hands of his pupils, the  harmony and colouring of the whole were lost or changed. For example,  Hoogstraten, his pupil, instructed Schalcken, as did also Gerard Dow;  but the candlelight pieces of Schalcken are hot and foxy, without any  redeeming grey tones. When he painted by candlelight, he placed his  sitter in a dark room, with a light, while he painted in another  apartment, having a hole cut through the door to communicate with his  sitter; the consequence was, the effect gave exactly what we see in  such cases--a red, dull treatment of colour. We know these facts by an  anecdote told of William the Third. When Schalcken was over in England,  the King wished to sit to him for his portrait, and hearing of his  celebrity in candlelight pieces, wished it painted under that effect.  The painter placed a light in his Majesty's hand, and retired into the  outer room; the candle guttering, kept dropping on the King's hand,  but being unwilling to disturb the artist, the King held on, while the  painter, intent on his work, proceeded without noticing it. Many of our  English artists paint by gaslight; but the tones of the flesh are not  benefited, gas shedding a white cool light compared with lamplight.    The practice of painting by candlelight originated neither with  Rembrandt nor Gainsborough; in fact, we find that all academies, from  the time of Bacio Bandinelli to our own, were always opened at night,  both for the purposes of drawing and painting. But these effects  generally remain where they originated, and are seldom taken advantage  of without the walls, the figure alone being considered, without  reference to the background. Tintoret was one of the first to apply the  principles to his practice. Fuseli, speaking of chiaro-scuro, says--\"The  nocturnal studies of Tintoret, from models and artificial groups, have  been celebrated; those prepared in wax or clay he arranged, raised,  suspended, to produce masses, foreshortening, and effect. It was thence  he acquired that decision of chiaro-scuro, unknown to more expanded  daylight, by which he divided his bodies, and those wings of obscurity  and light by which he separated the groups of his composition;  though the mellowness of his eye nearly always instructed him to  connect the two extremes by something that partook of both, as the  extremes themselves by the reflexes with the background or the  scenery. The general rapidity of his process, by which he baffled his  competitors, and often overwhelmed himself, did not, indeed, always  permit him to attend deliberately to this principle, and often hurried  him into an abuse of practice which in the lights turned breadth into  mannered or insipid flatness; and in the shadows into a total extinction  of parts. Of all this he has in the schools of San Rollo and Marco given  the most unquestionable instances--'The Resurrection of Christ,' and  'The Massacre of the Innocents,' comprehend every charm by which  chiaro-scuro fascinates its votaries. In the vision, dewy dawn melts  into deep but pellucid shade, itself sent or reflected by celestial  splendour and angelic hues; whilst in the infant massacre of Bethlehem,  alternate sheets of stormy light and agitated gloom dash horror on the  astonished eye.\"    Rembrandt, like Tintoret, never destroyed the effective character  of his chiaro-scuro by the addition of his colour, but made it a  main contributor to the general character of the subject; hence that  undisturbed and engulphing breadth which pervades his works. Fuseli,  in the same lecture, defends the Venetian school from being considered  as the \"ornamental school.\" After selecting several of the pictures of  Titian, as proofs of his grand and solemn specimens of colour, he thus  proceeds--\"But perhaps it is not to Titian, but to Tintoret and Paul  Cagliari, that the debaucheries of colour, and blind submission to  fascinating tints, the rage of scattering flowers to no purpose,  are ascribed. Let us select from Tintoret's most extensive work  in the Scuola of San Rocco, the most extensive composition, and his  acknowledged masterpiece--'The Crucifixion,' and compare its tone with  that of Rubens and Rembrandt of the same subject. What impression feels  he who for the first time casts a glance over the immense scenery of  that work? a whole whose numberless parts are connected by a lowering,  mournful, minacious tone. A general fearful silence hushes all around  the central figure of the Saviour suspended on the cross, his fainting  mother, and a group of male and female mourners at its foot--a group of  colours that less imitate than rival nature, and tinged by grief itself;  a scale of tones for which even Titian offers me no parallel--yet all  equally overcast by the lurid tone that stains the whole, and like a  meteor hangs in the sickly air. Whatever inequality or dereliction of  feeling, whatever improprieties of commonplace, of local and antique  costume, the master's rapidity admitted to fill his space, and they  are great, all vanish in the power which compresses them into a single  point, and we do not detect them till we recover from our terror.\"    The picture of Rubens which we oppose to Tintoret was painted for the  Church of St. Walburgha, at Antwerp, after his return from Italy, and  has been minutely described and as exquisitely criticised by Reynolds:  \"Christ,\" he says, \"is nailed to the cross, with a number of figures  exerting themselves to raise it. The invention of throwing the cross  obliquely from one corner of the picture to the other, is finely  conceived, something in the manner of Tintoret.\" So far Reynolds. \"In  Tintoret,\" says Fuseli, \"it is the cross of one of the criminals they  attempt to raise, who casts his eye on Christ, already raised. The body  of Christ is the grandest, in my opinion, that Rubens ever painted;  it seems to be imitated from the Torso of Apollonius, and that of the  Laocoon. How far it be characteristic of Christ, or correspondent with  the situation, I shall not here inquire; my object is the ruling tone of  the whole--and of this the criticism quoted says not a word, though much  of local colour, and grey and ochry balance. Would so great a master of  tone as Reynolds have forgot this master-key if he had found it in the  picture? The fact is, the picture has no other than the painter's usual  tone. Rubens came to his work with gay, technic exultation, and by the  magic of his pencil changed the horrors of Golgotha to an enchanted  garden and clusters of flowers. Rembrandt, though on a smaller scale  of size and composition, concentrated the tremendous moment in one flash  of pallid light. It breaks on the body of Christ, shivers down his  limbs, and vanishes on the armour of a crucifix--the rest is gloom.\"    This is given with all the eloquence Fuseli was so well able to utter;  but it displays, also, a severe castigation on those who would class  Tintoret and Paul Veronese in the catalogue of ornamental painters.  The observations which seem to have kindled his wrath are to be found  in Sir Joshua's fourth lecture, in which he says--\"Tintoret, Paul  Veronese, and others of the Venetian school, seem to have painted with  no other purpose than to be admired for their skill and experience in  the mechanism of painting, and to make a parade of that art which, as I  before observed, the higher style requires its followers to conceal.\"  But, to understand the matter, the whole lecture must be read. With  regard to the two pictures Fuseli brings into comparison with the  Venetian, both are described in Reynolds' Tour to Flanders and Holland.  Sir Joshua certainly criticizes the Rubens correctly with regard to  colouring; but sentiment it has none. The Rembrandt is now in the Munich  Gallery, and though one of his early pictures, it is very grand and  striking. Of it Reynolds remarks--\"There are likewise in this room eight  Rembrandts, the chief merit of which consists in his peculiarity of  manner--of admitting but little light, and giving to that little a  wonderful brilliancy. The colouring of Christ in the elevation of the  cross cannot be exceeded--it is exactly the tint of Vandyke's 'Susanna,'  in the other room; but whether the ground of this picture has been  repainted, or the white horse, which was certainly intended to make the  mass of light broader, has lost its brightness, at present the Christ  makes a disagreeable mass of light.\"    In bringing the opinions of these two great artists in contact, the  truth is elicited, that the tone of colour has much to do in conveying  the sentiment and pathos of the picture, and Rembrandt possessed this  quality in a very high degree. In the infancy of the arts, when  practised by rude nations, we find harsh and bright colours predominate  in a very strong scale--in fact, the brighter the more effective on the  uneducated eye; and it is only when the arts advance towards perfection  that a subdued tone of colour is demanded as most compatible with  refinement. Colour, both as an imitative quality, and also as an adjunct  towards assisting the character of his subject, seems always to have  been uppermost in Rembrandt's mind. His drawing, it is true, is open to  censure, but his colour will stand the most searching investigation, and  will always appear more transcendent the more it is examined. Reynolds,  in his Journey through Holland, mentions a picture by Rembrandt, in  the collection of the Prince of Orange--\"a study of a Susanna, for the  picture by Rembrandt which is in my possession: it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22693"],[0,"A Book of Myths (#13)"],[1,"not,\" said the oracle. \"To thee  marriage must bring woe.\"    So, with untouched heart, and with the daring and the courage of a  young lad, Atalanta came along with the heroes to the Calydonian Hunt.  She was so radiantly lovely, so young, so strong, so courageous, that  straightway Meleager loved her, and all the heroes gazed at her with  eyes that adored her beauty. And Diana, looking down at her, also  loved the maiden whom from childhood she had held in her protection--a  gallant, fearless virgin dear to her heart.    The grey mist rose from the marshes as the hunt began, and the hunters  of the boar had gone but a little way when they came upon traces of  the hated boar. Disembowelled beasts marked its track. Here, in a  flowery meadow, had it wallowed. There, in rich wheat land, had it  routed, and the marks of its bestial tusks were on the gashed grey  trunks of the trees that had once lived in the peace of a fruitful  olive grove.    In a marsh they found their enemy, and all the reeds quivered as it  heaved its vast bulk and hove aside the weed in which it had wallowed,  and rooted with its tusks amongst the wounded water-lilies before it  leapt with a snort to meet and to slay the men who had come against  it. A filthy thing it was, as its pink snout rose above the green ooze  of the marshes, and it looked up lustingly, defying the purity of the  blue skies of heaven, to bring to those who came against it a cruel,  shameful death.    Upon it, first of all, Jason cast his spear. But the sharp point only  touched it, and unwounded, the boar rushed on, its gross, bristly head  down, to disembowel, if it could, the gallant Nestor. In the branches  of a tree Nestor found safety, and Telamon rushed on to destroy the  filthy thing that would have made carrion of the sons of the gods. A  straggling cypress root caught his fleeting foot and laid him prone, a  helpless prey for the rooting brute. His hounds fell before it, but  ere it could reach him, Atalanta, full of vengeful rage--the pure  angered against the filthy and cruel--let draw her bow, with a prayer  to Diana to guide her shaft aright. Into the boar's smoking flank sped  the arrow.                          \"The sudden string      Rang, and sprang inward, and the waterish air      Hissed, and the moist plumes of the songless reeds      Moved as a wave which the wind moves no more.      But the boar heaved half out of ooze and slime,      His tense flank trembling round the barbed wound,      Hateful; and fiery with invasive eyes      And bristling with intolerable hair      Plunged, and the hounds clung, and green flowers and white      Reddened and broke all round them where they came.      And charging with sheer tusk he drove, and smote      Hyleus; and sharp death caught his sudden soul,      And violent sleep shed night upon his eyes.\"            Swinburne.    More than ever terrible was the monster now that it was wounded. One  after the other the hunters fell before its mad rage, and were sent to  the shades by a bloody and merciless death.    Before its furious charge even the heart of a hero might have been  stricken. Yet Meleager, like a mighty oak of the forest that will not  sway even a little before the rush of a storm, stood full in its way  and met its onslaught.        \"Aimed on the left side his well-handled spear      Grasped where the ash was knottiest hewn, and smote,      And with no missile wound, the monstrous boar      Right in the hairiest hollow of his hide      Under the last rib, sheer through bulk and bone,      Deep in; and deeply smitten, and to death,      The heavy horror with his hanging shafts,      Leapt, and fell furiously, and from raging lips      Foamed out the latest wrath of all his life.\"    Great was the shout that rose from those who still lived when that  grim hunt thus came to an end. And when, with his keen blade, Meleager  struck off the head, even as the quivering throat drew its last  agonised breath, louder still shouted the men of Greece. But not for  himself did Meleager despoil the body of his foe. He laid the ugly  thing at the feet of Atalanta.    \"This is thy spoil, not mine,\" he said. \"The wounding shaft was sped  by thee. To thee belongs the praise.\"    And Atalanta blushed rosily, and laughed low and gladly, not only  because Diana had heard her prayer and helped her slay the beast, but  for happiness that Meleager was so noble in his giving.    At that the brows of the heroes grew dark, and angrily one cried:                                    \"Lo, now,      Shall not the Arcadian shoot out lips at us,      Saying all we were despoiled by this one girl.\"    Like a spark that kindles the dry grass, their kindling anger spread,  and they rushed against Atalanta, seized the trophy she had been  given, and smote her as though she were but a shameless wanton and not  the noble daughter of a king.    And because the heart of Meleager was given very wholly to the fair  huntress, and because those whom he deemed his friends had not only  dishonoured her, but had done him a very grievous wrong, a great rage  seized him. Right and left he smote, and they who had been most bitter  in their jealousy of Atalanta, the two brothers of his own mother,  were laid low in death.    Tidings of the slaying of the boar had been brought to Althaea by swift  messengers, and she was on her way to the temples bearing gifts to the  gods for the victory of her son, when she beheld the slow-footed  procession of those who bore the bodies of the dead. And when she saw  the still faces of her two dear brothers, quickly was her joy turned  into mourning. Terrible was her grief and anger when she learned by  whose hand they were slain, and her mother's love and pride dried up  in her heart like the clear water of a fountain before the scorching  of a devouring fire. No sacrifices to the gods would she offer, but  her dead brothers should have the greatest sacrifice that mother could  make to atone for the guilt of her son. Back to the palace she went,  and from its safe hiding-place drew out the brand that she had rescued  from the flames when Meleager the hero was but a babe that made his  mother's heart sing for joy. She commanded a fire to be prepared, and  four times, as its flames blazed aloft, she tried to lay the brand  upon the pile. Yet four times she drew back, and then at last she  threw into the reddest of the ashes the charred brand that for a  little she held so close to her breast that it seemed as though she  fondled her child.    A wreath of leaves as sign of victory was being placed on Atalanta's  beautiful head by the adoring hands of Meleager when his mother gave  him his doom. Through his body there rushed a pang of mortal agony.  His blood turned to fire, and the hand of Death that smote him was as  a hand of molten lead. In torture his gallant spirit passed away,  uncomplaining, loving through his pain the maid for whose dear sake he  had brought woe upon himself. As the last white ashes in the fire  crumbled and fell away into nothingness, the soul of Meleager  departed. Swiftly through the dark valley his mother's shade followed  him, for she fell upon a sword and so perished. And Diana, looking  down on the grief-stricken sisters of Meleager and on the bitter  sorrow of his father, had compassion on them and turned them into  birds.    So ended the Calydonian Hunt, and Atalanta returned to Arcadia, heavy  at heart for the evil she had wrought unwittingly. And still the Three  Fates span on, and the winds caught up the cold wood ashes and blew  them across the ravaged land that Meleager had saved and that quickly  grew fertile again.          ATALANTA      Atalanta, daughter of the king of Arcadia, returned sad at heart to  her own land. Only as comrades, as those against whose skill in the  chase she was wont to pit her own skill, had she looked upon men. But  Meleager, the hero who loved her and her fair honour more than life  itself, and whose love had made him haste in all his gallant strength  and youthful beauty to the land of the Shades, was one to touch her as  never before had she been touched. Her father, proud of her triumph in  Calydon, again besought her to marry one of her many noble suitors.    \"If indeed they love me as thou sayest,\" said Atalanta to her father,  \"then must they be ready to face for my sake even the loss of dear  life itself. I shall be the prize of him who outruns me in a  foot-race. But he who tries and fails, must pay to Death his penalty.\"    Thereafter, for many days, a strange sight was to be seen in Arcadia.  For one after another the suitors came to race with the maiden whose  face had bewitched them, though truly the race was no more fair to him  who ran than would be a race with Death. No mortal man was as fleet as  Atalanta, who had first raced with the wild things of the mountains  and the forests, and who had dared at last to race with the winds and  leave even them behind. To her it was all a glorious game. Her  conquest was always sure, and if the youths who entered in the contest  cared to risk their lives, why should they blame her? So each day they  started, throbbing hope and fierce determination to win her in the  heart of him who ran--fading hope and despairing anger as he saw her  skimming ahead of him like a gay-hued butterfly that a tired child  pursues in vain. And each day, as the race ended, another man paid the  price of his defeat.    Daily, amongst those who looked on, stood her cousin Milanion. He  would fain have hated Atalanta for her ruthlessness and her joyousness  as he saw his friends die for her sake, yet daily her beauty, her  purity, and her gallant unconsciousness took a firmer hold upon his  heart. To himself he vowed that he would win Atalanta, but not without  help from the gods was this possible. Therefore he sought Aphrodite  herself and asked her aid.    Milanion was a beautiful youth, and to Aphrodite, who"]]]
