This fact has always seemed  to me to be a proof of natural selection, for, in regard to sexual  selection, it is quite obvious that the victory of the best-equipped  could have brought about the improvement only of the organs concerned,  the factors in the struggle, such as the eye and the olfactory organ.    We come now to the _excitants_; that is, to the group of sexual  characters whose origin through processes of selection has been most  frequently called in question. We may cite the _love-calls_ produced  by many male insects, such as crickets and cicadas. These could only  have arisen in animal groups in which the female did not rapidly flee  from the male, but was inclined to accept his wooing from the first.  Thus, notes like the chirping of the male cricket serve to entice the  females. At first they were merely the signal which showed the  presence of a male in the neighbourhood, and the female was gradually  enticed nearer and nearer by the continued chirping. The male that  could make himself heard to the greatest distance would obtain the  largest following, and would transmit the beginnings, and, later, the  improvement of his voice to the greatest number of descendants. But  sexual excitement in the female became associated with the hearing of  the love-call, and then the sound-producing organ of the male began to  improve, until it attained to the emission of the long-drawn-out soft  notes of the mole-cricket or the maenad-like cry of the cicadas. I  cannot here follow the process of development in detail, but will call  attention to the fact that the original purpose of the voice, the  announcing of the male's presence, became subsidiary, and the exciting  of the female became the chief goal to be aimed at. The loudest  singers awakened the strongest excitement, and the improvement  resulted as a matter of course. I conceive of the origin of bird-song  in a somewhat similar manner, first as a means of enticing, then of  exciting the female.    One more kind of secondary sexual character must here be mentioned:  the odour which emanates from so many animals at the breeding season.  It is possible that this odour also served at first merely to give  notice of the presence of individuals of the other sex, but it soon  became an excitant, and as the individuals which caused the greatest  degree of excitement were preferred, it reached as high a pitch of  perfection as was possible to it. I shall confine myself here to the  comparatively recently discovered fragrance of butterflies. Since  Fritz Mueller found out that certain Brazilian butterflies gave off  fragrance \"like a flower,\" we have become acquainted with many such  cases, and we now know that in all lands, not only many diurnal  Lepidoptera but nocturnal ones also give off a delicate odour, which  is agreeable even to man. The ethereal oil to which this fragrance is  due is secreted by the skin-cells, usually of the wing, as I showed  soon after the discovery of the _scent-scales_. This is the case in  the males; the females have no _special_ scent-scales recognisable as  such by their form, but they must, nevertheless, give off an extremely  delicate fragrance, although our imperfect organ of smell cannot  perceive it, for the males become aware of the presence of a female,  even at night, from a long distance off, and gather round her. We may  therefore conclude, that both sexes have long given forth a very  delicate perfume, which announced their presence to others of the same  species, and that in many species (_not in all_) these small  beginnings become, in the males, particularly strong scent-scales of  characteristic form (lute, brush, or lyre-shaped). At first these  scales were scattered over the surface of the wing, but gradually they  concentrated themselves, and formed broad, velvety bands, or strong,  prominent brushes, and they attained their highest pitch of evolution  when they became enclosed within pits or folds of the skin, which  could be opened to let the delicious fragrance stream forth suddenly  towards the female. Thus in this case also we see that characters, the  original use of which was to bring the sexes together, and so to  maintain the species, have been evolved in the males into means for  exciting the female. And we can hardly doubt, that the females are  most readily enticed to yield to the butterfly that sends out the  strongest fragrance,--that is to say, that excites them to the highest  degree. It is a pity that our organs of smell are not fine enough to  examine the fragrance of male Lepidoptera in general, and to compare  it with other perfumes which attract these insects.[43] As far as we  can perceive them they resemble the fragrance of flowers, but there  are Lepidoptera whose scent suggests musk. A smell of musk is also  given off by several plants: it is a sexual excitant in the  musk-deer, the musk-sheep, and the crocodile.    As far as we know, then, it is perfumes similar to those of flowers  that the male Lepidoptera give off in order to entice their mates and  this is a further indication that animals, like plants, can to a large  extent meet the claims made upon them by life, and produce the  adaptations which are most purposive,--a further proof, too, of my  proposition that the useful variations, so to speak, are _always  there_. The flowers developed the perfumes which entice their  visitors, and the male Lepidoptera developed the perfumes which entice  and excite their mates.    There are many pretty little problems to be solved in this connection,  for there are insects, such as some flies, that are attracted by  smells which are unpleasant to us, like those from decaying flesh and  carrion. But there are also certain flowers, some orchids for  instance, which give forth no very agreeable odour, but one which is  to us repulsive and disgusting; and we should therefore expect that  the males of such insects would give off a smell unpleasant to us, but  there is no case known to me in which this has been demonstrated.    In cases such as we have discussed, it is obvious that there is no  possible explanation except through selection. This brings us to the  last kind of secondary sexual characters, and the one in regard to  which doubt has been most frequently expressed,--decorative colours  and decorative forms, the brilliant plumage of the male pheasant, the  humming-birds, and the bird of Paradise, as well as the bright colours  of many species of butterfly, from the beautiful blue of our little  Lycaenidae to the magnificent azure of the large Morphinae of Brazil.  In a great many cases, though not by any means in all, the male  butterflies are \"more beautiful\" than the females, and in the Tropics  in particular they shine and glow in the most superb colours. I really  see no reason why we should doubt the power of sexual selection, and I  myself stand wholly on Darwin's side. Even though we certainly cannot  assume that the females exercise a conscious choice of the  \"handsomest\" mate, and deliberate like the judges in a court of  justice over the perfections of their wooers, we have no reason to  doubt that distinctive forms (decorative feathers), and colours have a  particularly exciting effect upon the female, just as certain odours  have among animals of so many different groups, including the  butterflies. The doubts which existed for a considerable time, as a  result of fallacious experiments, as to whether the colours of flowers  really had any influence in attracting butterflies have now been set  at rest through a series of more careful investigations; we now know  that the colours of flowers are there on account of the butterflies,  as Sprengel first showed, and that the blossoms of Phanerogams are  selected in relation to them, as Darwin pointed out.    Certainly it is not possible to bring forward any convincing proof of  the origin of decorative colours through sexual selection, but there  are many weighty arguments in favour of it, and these form a body of  presumptive evidence so strong that it almost amounts to certainty.    In the first place, there is the analogy with other secondary sexual  characters. If the song of birds and the chirping of the cricket have  been evolved through sexual selection, if the penetrating odours of  male animals,--the crocodile, the musk-deer, the beaver, the  carnivores, and, finally, the flower-like fragrances of the  butterflies have been evolved to their present pitch in this way, why  should decorative colours have arisen in some other way? Why should  the eye be less sensitive to _specifically male_ colours and other  _visible_ signs _enticing to the female_, than the olfactory sense to  specifically male odours, or the sense of hearing to specifically male  sounds? Moreover, the decorative feathers of birds are almost always  spread out and displayed before the female during courtship. I have  elsewhere[44] pointed out that decorative colouring and  sweet-scentedness may replace one another in Lepidoptera as well as in  flowers, for just as some modestly coloured flowers (mignonette and  violet) have often a strong perfume, while strikingly coloured ones  are sometimes quite devoid of fragrance, so we find that the most  beautiful and gaily-coloured of our native Lepidoptera, the species of  Vanessa, have no scent-scales, while these are often markedly  developed in grey nocturnal Lepidoptera. Both attractions may,  however, be combined in butterflies, just as in flowers. Of course, we  cannot explain why both means of attraction should exist in one genus,  and only one of them in another, since we do not know the minutest  details of the conditions of life of the genera concerned. But from  the sporadic distribution of scent-scales in Lepidoptera, and from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#13)"],[1," Moselle then attacked along the  Meuse, and, being also successful, was on the flank and rear of the  British and French retreating from Mons and Charleroi.    Thus a great enveloping movement was disclosed which for some days  gave every evidence of being successful. It was defeated, however,  entirely by the British, who, though outflanked and outnumbered three  to one, fought steadily night and day for six days, their small force  holding in complete check all of von Kluck's army corps. Retreat was  of course inevitable, but the retreat was made in good order and with  the morale of the troops unshaken.    In the meantime the German General Staff, which had confidently  expected to crush France before Russia could become a factor to be  reckoned with, saw with alarm Russia pouring her troops into East  Prussia in a drive against Koenigsberg, while in South Poland another  Russian army was preparing a drive against Galicia, operating from the  Ivangorod-Rowno railroad. Germany saw the Austrians being defeated  everywhere; Lemberg, the capital of Galicia, captured; Przemysl  masked, and the Russians fighting their way westward through Galicia  between the Carpathians and the Vistula. But Austria's troubles at  this stage were her own. Germany had all she could do to turn back the  Russian invasion of East Prussia.    To face the peril on her eastern borders Germany detached several army  corps--probably five--from the western front, with them reinforced  her eastern army, and in a few days after their arrival inflicted a  disastrous defeat on the Russians at Tannenburg, driving them back  practically to their own borders. But the damage had been done. The  armies of the west had been weakened at a critical point, and General  Joffre was given the opportunity he had been seeking since the  beginning of the war.    The French and British, whose retreat had carried them to the Marne,  now outnumbered the Germans, and, what is more important, were able to  concentrate their forces by calling in those troops who had been  engaged in the counter-offensive in Alsace. Taking advantage of their  superiority in numbers, the Allies took the offensive. Holding the  Germans fast in the centre, the Paris garrison struck hurriedly  northeast toward Soisson with the idea of getting around von Kluck's  flank. For several days it seemed that von Kluck and his army must be  captured. But, moving north with great rapidity, abandoning much of  his artillery and supplies, he escaped the net Joffre had spread for  him, and anchored himself securely behind the Aisne. The great German  movement was thus brought to an abrupt halt, and they were now on the  defensive. Paris was saved. For ten days the Allies fought desperately  to cross the Aisne and force von Kluck to continue his retreat. But  finally the effort was given up, and the two armies faced each other  across the Aisne deadlocked.    The Russians meanwhile had not been idle. Although their operations  against the reinforced German Army had a negative result, against the  Austrians in Galicia their success continued. Przemysl had not been  taken, but, hemming it in securely, the Russians passed on and took  the fortified town of Jaroslau, near the lower San. The menace of the  Russian invasion of Galicia then became apparent. Galicia, with her  wealth of oil and minerals, the fertile plains of Hungary just the  other side of the Carpathians, Cracow, opening the gate to Breslau and  Berlin--these were the things the Teutons stood in danger of losing,  and it is not surprising that they viewed the Russian advance with  alarm.    There is but one more incident to record before closing what might  well be considered the second phase of the war. That is the fall of  Antwerp. It was Belgium's final sacrifice on the altar of her national  honor. And no matter what our ancestry may be, nor how our sympathies  may lie, we cannot but reverence a people whose sense of national duty  and honor is so high that they are willing to sacrifice and do  sacrifice their all to maintain it.    THIRD PHASE    From the Fall of Antwerp to the Beginning of the Battle for Warsaw    When it became apparent to General French that the line of the Aisne,  to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne, was  too strong to be forced, he withdrew his troops, about 100,000 men,  from the line, his place being filled by the French reserves. The  object of the withdrawal was another flanking movement against the  German right. The idea seems to have been that by withdrawing and  entraining at night the movement would be entirely concealed from the  Germans until the British were actually in Belgium, and that an  advance along the left bank of the Scheldt would turn the flank of the  whole German army in France, compelling a general retreat. The  movement was discovered by German air scouts, however, and the troops  that had been before Antwerp met and checked the British, who took up  finally the line along the Yser Canal, through Ypres to La Bassee,  opposed by three German army corps.    But one thing saved the British from another defeat and prevented a  more disastrous retreat than that from Mons and Charleroi. When the  Germans took Antwerp the Belgian garrison of about 50,000 men escaped  and by a brilliant retreat retired to a line from Nieuport to Dixmude.  They thus guarded the left flank of the British line and by a  stubborn resistance prevented this flank from being turned and the  British driven south toward Paris. Nothing else prevented Dunkirk,  Calais, and Boulogne from falling into German hands at this time.    As it afterward turned out, the German plan, after the fall of  Antwerp, was a sudden drive to Calais. The plan was conceived and the  movement begun at the same time General French put into execution his  attempt to outflank the German position. These forces met on the  Ypres-La Bassee line, and both were halted. It was a fortuitous  chance, then, that the Germans were held back from the coast, as well  as deprived of an opportunity to strike at Paris from the north. For  three weeks the Germans battled fiercely, with almost total disregard  for the loss of life involved. Finally the attack died out, and with  its death the whole line from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier  settled down to trench warfare.    While the armies in the west were checking each other until the status  of a \"stalemate\" had been reached, affairs in the eastern theatre had  been moving rapidly. Persuaded by German money, a temptation the Turk  has ever been powerless to resist, Turkey late in October joined hands  with the Teutons and declared war on the Allies. The Japanese, who had  at the outset joined hands with England, had, after a wonderful  defense by the Germans, taken the German Chinese city of Kiao-Chau.  But of more importance still was the activity of the opposing armies  in Russia and in Galicia.    After the battle of Fannenburg, in which Russia was defeated and  driven back to her own borders, the Germans invaded Suwalki Province  in Northern Poland. The Russians again took the offensive, defeated  the Germans in the battle of Augustovo, and, pressing westward, again  entered East Prussia in the region of the Mazurian Lakes. In this  territory a deadlock followed, both Russians and Germans remaining  with horns locked and unable to move until early Spring.    In Galicia, however, events moved with greater rapidity, and the  results were vastly more important. After the fall of Lemberg and  Jaroslau the Russians pressed forward across the San to Tarnow,  masking Przemysl on the way, and took up a line along the Dunajec to  the Carpathians and east through Galicia along the Dniester and the  Pruth to the Rumanian frontier, thus threatening not only the plains  of Hungary, which lay just across the Carpathian summits, but also  Bukowina, the Crownland of Austria.    Austria's plight was desperate, and German assistance was necessary.  Von Hindenburg's first attack on Warsaw, the battle being called the  battle of the Vistula, was the answer. The Germans advanced against  the Russian centre, the Austrians against the left in Galicia. At  first both were successful, but heavy Russian reinforcements succeeded  in turning the German left, almost at the very gates of Warsaw. The  Germans were forced to retreat, and fell back to their own borders.  The Austrians were at the same time compelled to retreat, due to the  uncovering of their flank, and again Russia was in supreme control of  Galicia as far west as Cracow. As the Germans retreated the Russians  followed, and another invasion of Germany was threatened, and it was  von Hindenburg again who was to throw it back.    This he did, driving forward in three columns, two of which were  intended to move against the Russian flanks. The Russian centre fell  back to Lodz, but the right was still threatened. Again Russia  assembled her reserves, and before von Hindenburg realized the  situation a Russian army was not only on his flank but in his rear. A  retreat was necessary. The Germans, assisted by corps drawn from the  west, cut their way out and escaped from the Russian trap through the  failure of one of the Russian armies to co-operate in the movement in  time. But the German offense had failed and the effort had been  terribly expensive.    Another offense was immediately planned--this time to move along the  Vistula and strike at Warsaw from the southwest. This also was a  failure, and the two armies finally became deadlocked along the line  of the Bzura and the Rawka Rivers.    No further fighting of importance in this theatre until February, when  the battle of the Mazurian Lakes was fought. It will be recalled that  after the German defeat at Augustovo the Russians pursued the Germans  into the lake district, where the two armies became practically  deadlocked. This situation was broken by the Germans, who suddenly"]]]
