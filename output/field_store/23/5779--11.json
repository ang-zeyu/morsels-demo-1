[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#13)"],[1,"the scriptorium, where either the copyist and  illuminator worked separately and each on his own account, or where a  number of copyists awaited with pen and parchment the dictation by one  of the fraternity of some work of which a number of copies had to be  made. \"No admittance except on business\" was the rule of this chamber.  There, under the direction of the _armarius_, the expert writers did  their work.    Sometimes a single monk executed the book from first to last by himself.  He prepared the vellum, ruled it with the fine metal point, copied the  text, painted the illuminations, put on the gilding, and even added the  binding. Generally, however, the labour was divided--one monk scraped  and polished the parchment; another ruled it; another wrote the text,  leaving spaces for initials and miniatures; another put in the initials  and did the gilding and flourishing with borders, etc.; and another  painted the miniatures. This in the monasteries was done in the case of  large and important MSS., and afterwards, when illuminating became a  lay-craft, subdivision of labour was the common practice. Binding was  done in a special apartment, and by one specially skilled therein.    The _scriptorium_ was looked upon as a sort of sacred place, and the  work of copying often considered as a labour of piety and love--entered  upon with devout prayer, and solemnly blessed by the superior,  especially in cases where the books to be written were Bibles, or  connected with the services of the house, the Lives of the Saints, or  Treatises on Theology.    Very frivolous or absurd indeed are sometimes the inducements to  copyists to do gratuitous work of this kind, such as that every letter  transcribed paid for one sin of the copyist, and it is said that a  certain monk--a heavy sinner--only owed his salvation to the fact that  the number of letters in a Bible which he copied exceeded by a single  unit the sum total of his sins.          CHAPTER XIII    MONASTIC ILLUMINATION--_continued_    The copyists--Gratuitous labour--Last words of copyists--Disputes  between Cluny and Citeaux--The Abbey of Cluny: its grandeur and  influences--Use of gold and purple vellum--The more influential abbeys  and their work in France, Germany, and the Netherlands.      Of course, only really expert calligraphers were employed on great and  important works. In the monastery all such labour was gratuitous, that  is, the copyist received no pecuniary remuneration, only his food and  lodging. Yet even this had to be provided for. Hence the frequent  requests for donations from the laity.    To give a volume to a monastery did not always mean actually to present  the book, but to stand the expense of its production in the monastery  itself. In the case of specially distinguished penmen, their  entertainment in a monastery was sometimes an expensive business. It was  only in later times, however, when lay-artists were invited to reside in  the monastery to do their work that money was paid for their services.  Very often we find notices at the end of volumes that \"So-and-so\" had  ordered the book to be written and illuminated at his expense, and an  invocation for the gratitude of the reader and remembrance in his  prayers is added, sometimes with the date to the very hour when the book  was finished.    The copyist's last words after his task was completed are often very  full of weariness--sometimes pious, sometimes hankering after fleshly  lusts, occasionally quite too dreadful to repeat. \"May Christ recompense  for ever him who caused this book to be written.\" At the end of a Life  of St. Sebastian: \"Illustrious martyr, remember the monk Gondacus who in  this slender volume has included the story of thy glorious miracles. May  thy merits assist me to penetrate the heavenly kingdom; and may thy holy  prayers aid me as they have aided so many others who have owed to them  the ineffable enjoyments both of body and soul.\" Wailly quotes the  following: \"Dextram scriptoris benedicat mater honoris\" (\"May the mother  of honour bless the writer's right hand\"). A very common ending is \"Qui  scripsit scribat semper cum Domino vivat\" (\"He who wrote, let him write;  may he ever live with the Lord\"). Another: \"Explicit expliceat. Bibere  scriptor eat\" (\"It is finished. Let it be finished, and let the writer  go out for a drink\"). Another ending is \"Vinum scriptori reddatur de  meliori\" (\"Let wine of the best be given to the writer\"). And again:  \"Vinum reddatur scriptori, non teneatur\" (\"Let wine be given to the  writer; let it not be withheld\"). Here is the recompense wished for by a  French monk: \"Detur pro penâ scriptori pulcra puella\" (\"Let a pretty  girl be given to the writer for his pains,\" or \"as a penance\") The monks  enjoyed puns, as \"bibere,\" a common pun on \"vivere.\" One writer groans  thus: \"Scribere qui nescit, nullum putat esse laborem\" (\"Whoso knows not  how to write, thinks it is no trouble\").    As time goes on, after the tenth century, it is noticeable that the more  beautiful a manuscript becomes in its writing the less accurate becomes  its Latinity. And so the monks who once were noted for learning,  gradually lose their grip on Latin. The manuscripts executed in  Benedictine abbeys became inaccurate--almost illiterate. Faults of  ignorance of words; misrendering of proper names; blundering in the  inept introduction of marginal notes and confounding such notes with the  text, showing that the heart of the copyist was not in his work nor his  head capable of performing it. His hand is simply a machine, which when  it goes wrong does so without remorse and without shame. So in the  greater houses, men were appointed whose sole business was to supervise  the copyists--in fact, to supply the brains, while the scribe furnished  the manipulation of the pen. Even they, however, did not always succeed  to perfection, as very few of them were too well furnished with  scholarship. There were not many Alcuins or Theodulfs in the twelfth  century. What they did usually keep free from serious error were the  books used in their own services. It was the aim, particularly among the  Cistercian houses, to have their liturgical texts absolutely without  fault. In respect of illumination, there was a great quarrel between the  Abbey of Citeaux and that of Cluny. The great Abbey of Clugny (or Cluny)  in ancient Burgundy was founded in 910, and in the course of a century  or obtained a degree of splendour, influence, and prosperity unrivalled  by any other mediæval foundation. It possessed enormous wealth and  covered Western Europe with its affiliated settlements. Under Peter the  Venerable, when the controversy began, it was the chief monastic centre  of the Christian world. The words of Pope Urban II., when addressing the  community, were: \"Ye are the light of the world.\"    The grand Basilica at Cluny was completed in 1131, and, until the  erection of St. Peter's at Rome, was the largest church in Christendom,  and even then was only ten feet shorter than the Roman edifice. The  building is a masterpiece of architectural beauty and massiveness, being  with its narthex added by Abbat Roland de Hainaut, no less in length  than 555 feet. The splendour of the church, its gorgeous tombs and  mausoleums, its huge coronals for lights of brass, silver, and gold--the  grand candelabrum before the altar, with its settings of crystal and  beryl--the mural painting of the cupola, and the general luxury and  magnificence of the whole constituted an unpardonable sin in the eyes of  the stern and self-denying Cistercians. Hence arose long disputes  between the abbats of the two houses about tithes and other matters.  Among the other matters were included questions of candlesticks and  bindings and gildings of books. The two houses were long at variance on  the right definition of luxury in living, and this variance may to this  day be observed in their separate and distinct styles, both of  architecture and the ornamentation of books. The use of gold was still  continued in the older Benedictine abbeys, but was long forbidden in the  Cistercian, almost all the ornament of the latter being confined to  pen-drawing and the use of coloured inks. The employment of gold for the  text of manuscripts so common in the ninth century became rare in the  eleventh. Only here and there do we hear of such volumes. Where the gold  lettering still lingers, it is confined to the first page or two, and  the same may be said of the purple vellum. A certain monk, Adémar, who  died at Jerusalem in 1034, wrote a Life of St. Martial of Limoges  entirely in letters of gold; but it was quite an exceptional volume.  Another example occurs in an Evangeliary, which was probably a copy of a  ninth-century model, as at first glance it might be assigned to that  age, but on closer examination it is found that in one of the borders is  a medallion bearing the name of the Emperor Otho, showing that it cannot  be later than the latter part of the tenth century. It is now in the  National Library at Paris.    Before speaking of Othonian illumination it may be well to refer to that  of the Netherlands in these earlier centuries.    The most ancient writings known in this district were charters and other  documents, and the pious effusion of the occupants of the monasteries,  such as St. Amand, Lobbes, Stavelot, etc.    It was the revival of art and literature under Charlemagne that was the  beginning of artistic calligraphy, then followed the production of books  outside the monasteries, classical authors, chronicles, and mirrors of  various sciences. In the eleventh century we find monastic books and  others of which the ornamentation is sometimes even splendid, such as  Psalters, Evangeliaries, Bibles, and Missals, glowing with gold and  colours. Already the Abbeys of Stavelot and Liége were high-class  centres of production. St. Martin's of Tournay had a famous scriptorium  also,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#13)"],[1,"vocal bands are brought about through the alterations  in position of the arytenoid cartilages, to which they are attached  behind._    Before describing the muscles of the larynx, the reader is reminded of  the order of structures from above downward, in front, which is as  follows:         The hyoid bone.       The thyro-hyoid membrane.       The thyroid cartilage.       The crico-thyroid membrane.       The cricoid cartilage.       The trachea.    The latter is connected with the cricoid cartilage by its membrane.    All the above structures can be felt in one's own person, the more  readily if he be thin and have a long neck. The hyoid bone, or  tongue-bone, is that hard structure just above the cricoid cartilage,  and which one may easily demonstrate to be much more movable than the  larynx itself. The tongue muscles are attached to it above, and from  it, below, the larynx is suspended, as already explained.    The muscles of the larynx are best understood if the principle of  antagonistic action already referred to be remembered. Speaking  generally, the muscles are arranged _in pairs_ which have an opposite  or antagonistic action--viz.: (1) Those that open and close the  glottis; (2) those that regulate the tension, or degree of tightness,  of the vocal bands.    1. The muscles whose action tends to approximate the vocal bands--the  _adductors_--are the _arytenoid[=e]us proprius_ and the  _thyro-arytenoid[=e]us_. The former is attached to the posterior or  back surface of both arytenoid cartilages; the latter, as its name  indicates, to the anterior and inner surface of the thyroid and the  anterior lower surface or angle (_vocal process_) of the arytenoid.    The opening or widening of the glottis is effected on each side (one  muscle of the pair and its action being alone described in this  and other cases) by the antagonist of these muscles, the  _crico-arytenoid[=e]us posticus_, whose attachments are exactly as  indicated by the names--viz., to the posterior part of the two  cartilages named. When reading the description of these or other  muscles it is absolutely necessary to have a pictorial illustration or  the real object before one. The pull of this muscle is from the more  fixed point, as in all other cases; hence the force is applied in a  direction from below and outward, with the result that the  arytenoid cartilage is tilted outward, and with it the vocal band is  moved from the middle line.    [Illustration: FIG. 30 (Chapman). Diagram showing action of  crico-thyroid muscle, stretching of the vocal cords, and lengthening  of them. The dotted lines indicate the position assumed when the  muscle has contracted.]    [Illustration: FIG. 31 (Spalteholz). View of the larynx as looked at  from above. The illustration shows particularly well both the true and  the false vocal bands. The true vocal bands are placed much as they  are when a barytone is singing a very low tone. The part of the figure  lowest on the page represents the back part of the larynx.]    [Illustration: FIG. 32 (Spalteholz). A cross-section transverse to the  larynx, such as can be readily made with a strong knife.]    The _crico-thyroid_ also tends to open the glottis. Just as the  diaphragm is the most important muscle of breathing, so is the  crico-thyroid the most important in ordinary speaking and in singing  in the lower register. It is a relatively large and strong muscle with  an oblique direction in the main, though it is composed in reality of  several sets of fibres some of which are much more oblique in  direction than others (Fig. 28). As its name indicates, its points of  attachment are to the thyroid and the cricoid cartilages, but the most  fixed point (_origin_) is its point of attachment to the larger  cartilage; hence its direction of pull is from the thyroid, with the  result that the anterior part of the cricoid is drawn up, the  posterior part down, and the arytenoid cartilage, resting on the upper  part of the cricoid, backward, so that the vocal band is rendered  longer and more tense (see especially Fig. 29). It is important to  note that this is the muscle most used in singing the lower tones of  the scale, and that its action must necessarily cease, to a great  extent, when a certain point in the pitch is reached, as there is a  limit to the degree of contraction of all muscles; and, besides, the  crico-thyroid space is of very moderate size, and the cricoid  cartilage can ascend only within the limits thus determined. It thus  follows that Nature has provided in the change of mechanism for a new  register, which is nothing else than a change of mechanism with a  corresponding change of function. It will be at once apparent that the  claim that registers are an invention of men, and without foundation  in nature, is without support in anatomy and physiology. The  crico-thyroid is probably, however, of much more importance to tragic  actors and barytones than to tenors or sopranos. This, however, is no  excuse for the neglect of its development by the latter class, as  often happens, for without it the best tones of the lower register are  impossible. On the other hand, the elocutionists who prescribe for  students practices that involve the excessive use of this muscle, with  a cramped position of the vocal organs, the larynx being greatly drawn  down, with the view of producing disproportionately heavy lower tones,  must take no comfort from the above anatomical and physiological  facts. Art implies proportion, and it was one of the ambitions of all  the best actors in the golden age of histrionic art to have an \"even  voice\"--_i.e._, one equally good through the whole range required. The  tragic actor, elocutionist, and public speaker, and the singer,  whether soprano or bass, should neglect no muscle, though they may be  justified in developing some in excess of others, but ever with a  watchful eye on the weakest part.    2. The muscles which regulate the tension of the vocal bands are the  following:    (_a_) The _thyro-arytenoid[=e]us_ (pair), which by tilting the  arytenoid cartilages forward relaxes the tension of the vocal bands.  When they act with the adductors--_e.g._, the arytenoid[=e]us  proprius--the result must be relaxation and approximation behind,  which implies a greater or less degree of shortening, as usually  happens when a certain point in an ascending scale is reached in  persons whose methods of voice-production have not been in some way  modified, and a new register begins, which in most female voices is  marked by a more or less distinct and abrupt alteration of the quality  of the tone.    The crico-thyroids are the antagonists of the above-named muscles, and  they may act either very much alone or, to some extent, in cooeperation  with the above, to regulate or steady their action; for in movements  so complicated as those required for voice-production it is highly  probable that we are inclined to reduce our explanations of muscular  action to a simplicity that is excessive, and to appreciate but  inadequately the delicacy and complexity of the mechanism and the  processes involved. It is quite certain that in the production of the  highest tones of a tenor or soprano several muscles cooeperate, and  one, especially, seems to be of great importance in the formation of  such tones, most of all, perhaps, in high sopranos. The muscle  referred to is the thyro-arytenoid already described. It is not only  attached to the two cartilages indicated by its name, but also along  the whole of the external or outer surface of the vocal band. It will  be remembered that practically all the muscles are arranged in pairs,  one on each side of the middle line. The muscle now under  consideration, more, perhaps, than any other, is complex in its  action. Apparently a very few of its fibres may act more or less  independently of all the others at a particular moment and with a  specific and very delicate result, a very slight change in pitch.  Exactly how this is attained no one has as yet adequately explained;  but it is doubtful whether any singer who does not possess a perfect  control over this muscle can produce the highest tones of the soprano  with ease and effectiveness. It is especially the muscle of the human  birds of the higher flights.    (_b_) To these thyro-arytenoids, which for most singers and all  speakers are probably chiefly relaxing in action, must be added as  aiding in this function another pair, the _lateral crico-arytenoids_.  They are situated between the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, and  the direction of action is obliquely from below and forward, upward,  and backward, so that the arytenoids are brought forward and also  approximated more or less, which involves relaxed tension, at least,  possibly also shortening of the vocal bands.    When a tenor or soprano singer reaches the upper tones, say about  [Illustration: e'' f'' g''], or higher, there is considerable closing  up in the larynx, much in the way in which the parts of the month are  brought together in sucking. This is termed _sphincter action_, the  mouth and the eyes being closed by such action, of which they are  the most easily observed examples. As a result of this squeezing there  is in some cases that reddening of the face and that tightness which  is often felt uncomfortably, and which is _straining_, because when  present in more than a very slight degree it is injurious, owing to  congestion or accumulation of blood in the blood-vessels, with all the  bad consequences of such a state of things. When the tightening does  not go beyond a certain point it is normal--indeed, such sphincter  action is inevitable; but it is the excess which is so common in  tenors and others who strain for undue power, and to produce tones too  high in pitch for their development or their method, which is so  disastrous to the throat and to the best art also.
