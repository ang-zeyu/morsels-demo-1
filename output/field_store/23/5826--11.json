I borried a hoss to use in the day and took him back  home every night for about a year.    The niggers kept talking about being free, but they wasn't free then  and they ain't now.    Putting them free jest like putting goat hair on a sheep. When it rain  de goat come a running and git in de shelter, 'cause his hair won't  shed the rain and he git cold, but de sheep ain't got sense enough to  git in the shelter but jest stand out and let it rain on him all day.    But the good Lord fix the sheep up wid a woolly jacket that turn the  water off, and he don't git cold, so he don't have to have no brains.    De nigger during slavery was like de sheep. He couldn't take care of  hisself but his Master looked out for him and he didn't have to use  his brains. De master's protection was like de wooly coat.    But de 'mancipation come and take off de woolly coat and leave de  nigger wid no protection and he cain't take care of hisself either.    When de niggers was sot free lots of them got mighty uppity, and  everybody wanted to be a delegate to something or other. The Yankees  told us we could go down and vote in the 'lections and our color was  good enough to run for anything. Heaps of niggers believed them. You  cain't fault them for that, 'cause they didn't have no better sense,  but I knowed the black folks didn't have no business mixing in until  they knowed more.    It was a long time after the War before I went down to vote and  everything quiet by that time, but I heard people talk about the  fights at the schoolhouse when they had the first election.    I jest stayed on around the old place a long time, and then I got on  another piece of ground and farmed, not far from Greenville until  1900. Then I moved to Hearn, Texas, and stayed with my son Ed until  1903 when we moved to Sapulpa in the Creek Nation. We come to Tulsa  several years ago, and I been living with him ever since.    I can't move off my bed now, but one time I was strong as a young  bull. I raised seven boys and seven girls. My boys was named Edward,  Joseph, Furney, Julius, James, and William, and my girls was Luvenia,  Olivia, Chanie Mamie, Rebecca and Susie.    I always been a deep Christian and depend on God and know his unseen  Son, the King of Glory. I learned about Him when I was a little boy.  Old Master was a good man, but on some of the plantations the masters  wasn't good men and the niggers didn't get the Word.    I never did get no reading and writing 'cause I never did go to the  schools. I thought I was too big, but they had schools and the young  ones went.    But I could figger, and I was a good farmer, and now I bless the Lord  for all his good works. Everybody don't know it I reckon, but we all  needed each other. The blacks needed the whites, and still do.    There's a difference in the color of the skin, but the souls is all  white, or all black, 'pending on the man's life and not on his skin.  The old fashioned meetings is busted up into a thousand different  kinds of churches and only one God to look after them. All is  confusion, but I ain't going to worry my old head about 'em.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves  [Date stamp AUG 19 1937]    ALICE DOUGLASS  Age 77 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Okla.      I was born December 22, 1860 in Sumner County, Tennessee. My mother--I  mean mammy, 'cause what did we know 'bout mother and mamma. Master and  Mistress made dey chillun call all nigger women, \"Black Mammy.\" Jest  as I was saying my mammy was named Millie Elkins and my pappy was  named Isaac Garrett. My sisters and brothers was Frank, Susie and  Mollie. They is all in Nashville, Tennessee right now. They lived in  log houses. I 'member my grandpappy and when he died. I allus slept in  the Big House in a cradle wid white babies.    We all the time wore cotton dresses and we weaved our own cloth. The  boys jest wore shirts. Some wore shoes, and I sho' did. I kin see 'em  now as they measured my feets to git my shoes. We had doctors to wait  on us iffen we got sick and ailing. We wore asafedida to keep all  diseases offen us.    When a nigger man got ready to marry, he go and tell his master that  they was a woman on sech and sech a farm that he'd lak to have. Iffen  master give his resent, then he go and ask her master and iffen he say  yes, well, they jest jump the broomstick. Mens could jest see their  wives on Sadday nite.    They laid peoples 'cross barrels and whupped 'em wid bull whups till  the blood come. They'd half feed 'em and niggers'd steal food and cook  all night. The things we was forced to do then the whites is doing of  their own free will now. You gotta reap jest what you sow 'cause the  Good Book says it.    They used to bid niggers off and then load 'em on wagons and take 'em  to cotton farms to work. I never seen no cotton till I come heah.  Peoples make big miration 'bout girls having babies at 11 years old.  And you better have them whitefolks some babies iffen you didn't wanta  be sold. Though a funny thing to me is, iffen a nigger woman had a  baby on the boat on the way to the cotton farms, they throwed it in  the river. Taking 'em to them cotton farms is jest the reason niggers  is so plentiful in the South today.    I ain't got no education a'tall. In dem days you better not be caught  with a newspaper, else you got a beating and your back almost cut off.  When niggers got free, whitefolks killed 'em by the carload, 'cause  they said it was a nigger uprising. I used to lay on the flo' with the  whitefolks and hear 'em pass. Them patrollers roved trying to ketch  niggers without passes to whup 'em. They was sometimes called bush  whackers.    We went to white folks' church. I was a great big girl before we went  to cullud church. We'd stay out and play while they worshipped. We  jest played marbles--girls, white chillun and all.    The Yankees come thoo' and took all the meat and everything they could  find. They took horses, food and all. Mammy cooked their vittles. One  come in our cabin and took a sack of dried fruit with my mammy's shoes  on the top. I tried to make 'em leave mammy's shoes too but he didn't.    I stayed in the house with the whitefolks till I was 19. They lak to  kept me in there too long. That's why I'm selfish as I am. Within  three weeks after I was out of the house, I married William Douglass.  Whitefolks now don't want you to tech 'em, and I slept with white  chillun till I was 19. You kin cook for 'em and put your hands in they  vittles and they don't say nothing, but jest you tech one!    We stayed on, on the place, three or four years and it was right then  mammy give us our pappy's name. We moved from the place to one three  or four miles from our master's place, and mammy cooked there a long  time.    Abraham Lincoln gits too much praise. I say, shucks, give God the  praise. Lincoln come thoo' Gallitan, Tennessee and stopped at Hotel  Tavern with his wife. They was dressed jest lak tramps and nobody  knowed it was him and his wife till he got to the White House and  writ back and told 'em to look 'twixt the leaves in the table where he  had set and they sho' nuff found out it was him.    I never mentions Jeff Davis. He ain't wuff it.    Booker T. Washington was all right in his place. He come here and told  these whitefolks jest what he thought. Course he wouldn't have done  that way down South. I declare to God he sho' told 'em enough. They  toted him 'round on their hands. No Jim Crow here then.    I jined the church 'cause I had religion round 60 years ago. People  oughta be religious sho'; what for they wanta live in sin and die and  go to the Bad Man. To git to Heaven, you sho' ought to work some. I  want a resting place somewhar, 'cause I ain't got none here. I am a  member of Tabernacle Baptist Church, and I help build the first church  in Oklahoma City.    I got three boys and three girls. I don't know none's age. I give 'em  the best education I could.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves  [Date stamp: AUG 13 1937]    DOC DANIEL DOWDY  Age 81 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma      I was born June 6, 1856 in Madison County, Georgia. Father was named  Joe Dowdy and mother was named Mary Dowdy. There was 9 of us boys,  George, Smith, Lewis, Henry, William, myself, Newt, James and Jeff.  There was one girl and she was my twin, and her name was Sarah. My  mother and father come from Richmond, Va., to Georgia. Father lived on  one side of the river and my mother on the other side. My father would  come over ever week to visit us. Noah Meadows bought my father and  Elizabeth Davis, daughter of the old master took my mother. They  married in Noah Meadows' house.    My mother was the cook in the Big House. They'd give us pot likker  with bread crumbs in it. Sometimes meat, jest sometimes, very seldom.  I liked black-eyed peas and still do till now. We lived in  weatherboard house. Our parents had corded-up beds with ropes and us  chillun slept on the floor for most part or in a hole bored in a log.  Our house had one window jest big enough to stick your head out of,  and one door, and this one door faced the Big House which was your  master's house. This was so that you couldn't git out 'less somebody  seen you.    My job was picking up chips and keeping the calves and cows separate  so that the calves wouldn't suck the cows dry. Mostly, we had Saturday  afternoons off to wash. I was show boy doing [HW: during] the war, me  and my sister, 'cause we was twins. My mother couldn't be bought  'cause she done had 9 boys for one farm and neither my father, 'cause  he was the father of 'em. I was religious and didn't play much, but I  sho' did like to listen to preachings. I did used to play marbles  sometimes.    We jest wore shirts and nothing else both winter and summer. They was  a little heavier in winter and that's all. No shoes ever. I had none  till after I was set free. I guess I was almost 12 years old "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20788"],[0,"Storm Over Warlock (#13)"],[1," done so by now, they either could not, or would not free it from the  trap. Shann dozed again, untroubled by any dreams, to awake hearing the  shrieks of clak-claks. But when he studied the sky he was able to sight  none of the cliff-dwelling Warlockian bats.    \"More likely they are paying attention to our friend back in the  valley,\" Thorvald said dryly, rightly reading Shann's glance to the  clouds overhead. \"Ought to keep them busy.\"    Clak-claks were meat eaters, only they preferred their chosen prey weak  and easy to attack. The imprisoned hound would certainly attract their  kind. And those shrill cries now belling through the mountain heights  ought to draw everyone of their species within miles.    \"There it is!\" Thorvald, pulling himself to his feet by a rock handhold,  gazed westward, his gaunt face eager.    Shann, expecting no less than a cruising Throg ship, searched for cover  on their perch. Perhaps if they flattened themselves behind the fall of  stones, they might be able to escape attention. Yet Thorvald made no  move into hiding. And so Shann followed the line of the other's fixed  stare.    Before and below them lay a maze of heights and valleys, sharp drops,  and saw-toothed rises. But on the far rim of that section of badlands  shone the green of a Warlockian sea rippling on to the only dimly seen  horizon. They were now within sight of their goal.    Had they had one of the exploration sky-flitters from the overrun camp,  they could have walked its beach sands within the hour. Instead, they  fought their way through a Devil-designed country for the next two days.  Twice they had narrow escapes from the Throg ship--or ships--which  continued to sweep across the rugged line of the coast, and only a quick  dive to cover, wasting precious time cowering like trapped animals,  saved them from discovery. But at least the hound did not bay again on  the tangled trail they left, and they hoped that the trap and the  clak-claks had put that monster permanently out of service.    On the third day they came down to one of those fiords which tongued  inland, fringing the coast. There had been no lack of hunting in the  narrow valleys through which they had threaded, so both men and  wolverines were well fed. Though animal fur wore better than the now  tattered uniforms of the men.    \"Now where?\" Shann asked.    Would he now learn the purpose driving Thorvald on to this coastland?  Certainly such broken country afforded good hiding, but no better  concealment than the mountains of the interior.    The Survey officer turned slowly around on the shingle, studying the  heights behind them as well as the angle of the inlet where the wavelets  lapped almost at their battered boot tips. Opening his treasured map  case, he began a patient checking of landmarks against several of the  strips he carried. \"We'll have to get on down to the true coast.\"    Shann leaned against the trunk of a conical branched mountain tree,  pulling absently at the shreds of wine-colored bark being shed in  seasonal change. The chill they had known in the upper valleys was  succeeded here by a humid warmth. Spring was becoming a summer such as  this northern continent knew. Even the fresh wind, blowing in from the  outer sea, had already lost some of the bite they had felt two days  before when its salt-laden mistiness had first struck them.    \"Then what do we do there?\" Shann persisted.    Thorvald brought over the map, his black-rimmed nail tracing a route  down one of the fiords, slanting out to indicate a lace of islands  extending in a beaded line across the sea.    \"We head for these.\"    To Shann that made no sense at all. Those islands ... why, they would  offer less chance of establishing a safe base than the broken land in  which they now stood. Even the survey scouts had given those spots of  sea-encircled earth the most cursory examination from the air.    \"Why?\" he asked bluntly. So far he had followed orders because they had  for the most part made sense. But he was not giving obedience to  Thorvald as a matter of rank alone.    \"Because there is something out there, something which may make all the  difference now. Warlock isn't an empty world.\"    Shann jerked free a long thong of loose bark, rolling it between his  fingers. Had Thorvald cracked? He knew that the officer had disagreed  with the findings of the team and had been an unconvinced minority of  one who had refused to subscribe to the report that Warlock had no  native intelligent life and therefore was ready and waiting for human  settlement because it was technically an empty world. But to continue to  cling to that belief without a single concrete proof was certainly a  sign of mental imbalance.    And Thorvald was regarding him now with frowning impatience. You were  supposed to humor delusions, weren't you? Only, could you surrender and  humor a wild idea which might mean your death? If Thorvald wanted to go  island-hopping in chance of discovering what never had existed, Shann  need not accompany him. And if the officer tried to use force, well,  Shann was armed with a stunner, and had, he believed, more control over  the wolverines. Perhaps if he merely gave lip agreement to this  project.... Only he didn't believe, noting the light deep in those gray  eyes holding on him, that anybody could talk Thorvald out of this  particular obsession.    \"You don't believe me, do you?\" The impatience arose hotly in that  demand.    \"Why shouldn't I?\" Shann tried to temporize. \"You've had a lot of  exploration experience; you should know about such things. I don't  pretend to be any authority.\"    Thorvald refolded the map and placed it in the case. Then he pulled at  the sealing of his blouse, groping in an inner secret pocket. He  uncurled his fingers to display his treasure.    On his palm lay a coin-shaped medallion, bone-white but possessing an  odd luster which bone would not normally show. And it was carved. Shann  put out a finger, though he had a strange reluctance to touch the  object. When he did he experienced a sensation close to the tingle of a  mild electric shock. And once he had made that contact, he was also  impelled to pick up that disk and examine it more closely.    The carved pattern was very intricate and had been done with great  delicacy and skill, though the whorls, oddly shaped knobs, ribbon  tracings, made no connected design he could determine. After a moment or  two of study, Shann became aware that his eyes, following those twists  and twirls, were \"fixed,\" that it required a distinct effort to look  away from the thing. Feeling some of that same alarm as he had known  when he first heard the wailing of the Throg hound, he let the disk fall  back into Thorvald's hold, even more disturbed when he discovered that  to relinquish his grasp required some exercise of will.    \"What is it?\"    Thorvald restored the coin to his hiding place.    \"You tell me. I can say this much, there is no listing for anything even  remotely akin to this in the Archives.\"    Shann's eyes widened. He absently rubbed the fingers which had held the  bone coin--if it was a coin--back and forth across the torn front of his  blouse. That tingle ... did he still feel it? Or was his imagination at  work again? But an object not listed in the exhaustive Survey Archives  would mean some totally new civilization, a new stellar race.    \"It is definitely a created article,\" the Survey officer continued. \"And  it was found on the beach of one of those sea islands.\"    \"Throg?\" But Shann already knew the answer to that.    \"Throg work--_this_?\" Thorvald was openly scornful. \"Throgs have no  conception of such art. You must have seen their metal plates--those are  the beetle-heads' idea of beauty. Have those the slightest resemblance  to this?\"    \"Then who made it?\"    \"Either Warlock has--or once had--a native race advanced enough in a  well-established form of civilization to develop such a sophisticated  type of art, or there have been other visitors from space here before us  and the Throgs. And the latter possibility I don't believe----\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because this was carved of bone or an allied substance. We haven't been  quite able to identify it in the labs, but it is basically organic  material. It was found exposed to the weather and yet it is in perfect  condition, could have been carved any time within the past five years.  It has been handled, yes, but not roughly. And we have come across  evidences of no other star-cruising races or species save ourselves and  the Throgs. No, I say this was made here on Warlock, not too long ago,  and by intelligent beings of a very high grade of civilization.\"    \"But they would have cities,\" protested Shann. \"We've been here for  months, explored all over this continent. We would have seen them or  some traces of them.\"    \"An old race, maybe,\" Thorvald mused, \"a very old race, perhaps in  decline, reduced to a remnant in numbers with good reason to retire into  hiding. No, we've discovered no cities, no evidence of a native culture  past or present. But this--\" he touched the front of his blouse--\"was  found on the shore of an island. We may have been looking in the wrong  place for our natives.\"    \"The sea....\" Shann glanced with new interest at the green water surging  in wavelets along the edge of the fiord.    \"Just so, the sea!\"    \"But scouts have been here for more than a year, one team or another.  And nobody saw anything or found any traces.\"    \"All four of our base camps were set inland, our explorations along the  coast were mainly carried out by flitter, except for one party--the one  which found this. And there may be excellent local reasons why any  native never showed himself to us. For that matter, they may not be able  to exist on land at all, any more than we could live without artificial  aids in the sea.\"    \"Now----?\"    \"Now we must make a real attempt to find them if they do exist"]]]
