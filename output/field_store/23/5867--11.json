Duthac and Fergus are also associated with  the church of the district during the Celtic period, and during the  time of the former Keledei they may have been introduced here. The early  church of Dornoch was dedicated to St. Bar or Finbar, and before 1196  the Culdees had disappeared, and the clerical element was reduced to a  single priest.[179] The deed establishing a cathedral chapter of ten  canons, with dean, precentor, chancellor, treasurer, and archdeacon,  proceeds on the narrative \"that in the times of his (Bishop Gilbert's)  predecessors there was but a single priest ministering in the cathedral,  both on account of the poverty of the place and by reason of frequent  hostilities; and that he desired to extend the worship of God in that  church, and resolved to build a cathedral church at his own expense, to  dedicate it to the Virgin Mary, and, in proportion to his limited means,  to make it conventual.\"[180] This benefactor of Dornoch was Bishop  Gilbert de Moravia (1222-1245), who organised the chapter after the  pattern of Elgin, which again had Lincoln for its model; and although  the see of Caithness is first heard of about 1130, to him is due the  credit of rebuilding the cathedral, which consisted of an aisled nave,  transept, choir, and massive central tower, with dwarfish spire. The old  cathedral town, with its society of learned churchmen, maintaining a  high position by their influence and example, cultivating letters,  preaching peace and practising it, must have been a centre of good in  the north, and Bishop Gilbert's name deserves to be honourably  remembered for his statesmanship, beneficence, and Christian character.  \"He rests,\" says the breviary of Aberdeen, \"in the church which he built  _with his own hands_\"; even the glass was manufactured at Cyderhall  under his personal supervision.[181]    The tower is all that remains of Bishop Gilbert's work, for the  cathedral was burnt in 1570; the tower escaped with some fine Gothic  arches which fell before the terrific gale of 5th November 1605--the day  on which the Gunpowder Plot was discovered. In 1614 the 13th Earl of  Sutherland partially repaired the cathedral, to make it available for  the parish church, and in 1835-1837 it was rebuilt by the Duchess of  Sutherland at a cost of L6000. It had thus the misfortune to be restored  at a time when church restoration in Scotland was at its lowest ebb.  \"The blame really attaches to those whom she entrusted with the  execution of her design.\"[182] The structure is now used as the parish  church of Dornoch. The square tower of the bishop's palace still  survives.      10. DIOCESE OF GALLOWAY    The name of Whithorn is a venerable one in Scottish Church history. It  is mentioned by Ptolemy, the Alexandrian geographer, in the second  century as Leukopibia, a town of the Novantae. The Greek name is  synonymous with the Latin Candida Casa or \"White House,\" under which  designation it was latterly known. It is associated with the first known  apostle of Christianity in Scotland, St. Ninian, who was probably born  here about the middle of the fourth century. Of studious and ascetic  habits, he visited Rome, and on his homeward journey visited St. Martin  of Tours, who died in 397. After his arrival in Scotland, he founded the  Candida Casa or Church of Whithorn, dedicated it to St. Martin, and,  although Christianity was probably known in Scotland before his time,  his work is the first distinct fact in the history of the Scottish  Church. After preaching the Gospel among the Southern Picts, he died in  432, and was buried within his church at Whithorn. It is a matter of  dispute, whether this first Christian oratory was built, after the  custom of the early Scottish Church, on a small island or peninsula at  the point of the promontory which lies between the bays of Luce and  Wigtown, about three miles south from Whithorn, or on the spot where the  monastery afterwards arose. There are the ruins of a small chapel on  \"The Isle,\" and although belonging to a later date, it is more than  probable that it was the successor of St. Ninian's first church.  Whithorn was famous also for its early schools and monastery, and  exercised no small influence in Christianising both the surrounding  district and Northumbria, or what is now known as the northerly parts of  England. A bishopric of Whithorn was founded by the Angles in 727, was  held by five successive bishops, and came to an end about 796, when the  disorganisation of the Northumbrian kingdom enabled the native  population to eject the strangers and assert their own independence.  During the reign of David I. (1124-1153), Fergus, Lord of Galloway,  re-established the see of Galloway, and founded at Whithorn a  Premonstratensian priory, whose church became the cathedral, and  contained the shrine of St. Ninian. The see included the whole of  Wigtownshire and the greater part of Kirkcudbrightshire; the bishop  remained under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of York till at least  the fourteenth century, and in 1472 became suffragan of St. Andrews. In  1491, when Glasgow became a metropolitan see, the Bishop of Galloway  became a Vicar-General of it during vacancies. The canons of Whithorn  Priory formed the chapter of the see of Galloway, and the prior ranked  next to the bishop; the diocese was divided into three rural deaneries.  The shrine of St. Ninian became a place of pilgrimage for people from  all parts of Scotland, and was visited by Scottish queens and  kings--James IV. visited it generally once and frequently twice a year  throughout his whole reign. The priory became wealthy, and the church  and other buildings were of great extent. Among its priors may be  mentioned Gavin Dunbar (1514), who was tutor to James V. and afterwards  Archbishop of Glasgow; and James Beaton, who was prior and afterwards  Bishop of Galloway, was advanced to the archbishopric of Glasgow in  1509, and of St. Andrews in 1522.    The buildings of the priory are now reduced to the nave--an aisleless  structure--and to some underground vaulted buildings, which no doubt  formerly supported the choir and other erections above.[183] The west  tower fell in the beginning of last century; the cloister lay to the  north of the nave; the chapter-house, slype, and site of domestic  buildings extended to the north of the transept. The north wall of the  nave interior contains two pointed recesses for monuments, which are of  excellent design. At the south-west angle of the nave is a doorway which  is undoubtedly Norman,[184] and the sculptures on the right and left of  the projecting wall point to a close affinity between the sculptured  figures on the ancient stones and the architecture of the twelfth  century in Scotland.[185] The ancient font, probably of Norman date,  bowl-shaped, and of simple design, has been preserved in the church, and  St. Ninian's Cave--probably a place of religious retirement--about three  miles south-east of the village, contains some very old stone crosses,  and on its east wall some very old inscriptions, a number of which are  partly unintelligible by being covered with more recent ones.    The neighbourhood will always be associated with St. Ninian, the apostle  of the Britons and of the Southern Picts, and may be called the  historical fountain-head of the Scottish Church.      11. DIOCESE OF LISMORE OR ARGYLL    Lismore is an ancient settlement, and is the Epidium of Ptolemy, one of  his five Ebudae.[186] The island lies near the south end of Loch Linnhe,  and at a short distance from the mainland of Argyllshire.    The bishopric was formed about 1200 by the separation of the districts,  belonging to the bishopric of Dunkeld, which lay to the west of the  great range of Drumalban. Eraldus was the first Bishop of Argyll, and  had his seat at Muckairn, while his church bore the name of  Killespeckerill, or the church of Bishop Erailt.[187] It is possible  that some of the Keledei from Dunkeld may have accompanied the new  bishop and been established there. In 1236 the see was transferred from  Muckairn, on the south side of Loch Etive, to Lismore, where, long  before, a Columban monastery had been founded by St. Lughadh or Moluoc.  The see was afterwards known as the bishopric of Lismore, and contained  the following deaneries: Kintyre, with twelve parishes; Glassary or  Glasrod, with thirteen; Lorn, with fourteen; and Morvern, with  eight.[188] The cathedral was perhaps the humblest in Britain, and was  probably erected soon after the transference of the see in the  thirteenth century. It is said to have been a structure 137 feet long by  29-1/3 wide, but of this there only now survives an aisleless choir,  with traces of a chapter-house and sacristy; and, as re-roofed in 1749,  this choir now serves as a parish church. It has four buttresses of  simple form against the south wall, and two at each of the north and  south angles of the east wall. In the south wall, and in the usual  position near the east end, there are remains of a triple sedilia;  there is a piscina in a pointed recess, having a trefoil-headed niche in  the wall behind.[189]    One of the deans of Lismore, Sir James MacGregor, between 1512 and 1540,  compiled a commonplace book, filled chiefly with Gaelic heroic ballads,  several of which are ascribed to the authorship of Ossian.      12. DIOCESE OF THE ISLES    The history of Iona is associated with St. Columba, and, although its  church did not attain full cathedral status until 1506, the island was  one of the earliest centres of Christianity in Scotland.    St. Columba (Columcille or Colm) was born at Gartan, County Donegal, 7th  December 521, and was the son of a chief related to several of the  princes then reigning in Ireland and the west of Scotland. He studied  under St."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#13)"],[1,"expectations.  The rooms, indeed, were  small, being, like those of all Moorish dwellings, rather long and  narrow, with recesses or antechambers.  Some of these latter had  dome-shaped roofs, with little coloured glass skylights, such as we have  already described, and were delightfully snug retreats.  The walls and  ceilings of all the apartments were profusely ornamented, and the  hangings and furniture were of the richest material.    On a silken couch, at the farther end of one of these small apartments,  sat the bride, Zara, youngest daughter of the cadi, and a lovely girl of  nineteen.  Poor Zara!  Her history--not by any means an uncommon one in  that land--goes to prove that Mohammedan women, far more than English,  have need of a \"Women's Rights Society.\"    Zara was already a widow with two beautiful children!  Her first  husband, to whom she had been married without her inclination being  consulted, had been strangled.    It was afterwards proved that he was innocent of the crime for which he  had suffered, but that gave very little pain to the consciences of those  who had strangled him, partly because their consciences were callous,  and partly because they regarded the event as one of the decrees of  \"Fate.\"    After his death it became necessary that another husband should be found  for Zara.  She, poor creature, would have been thankful to have remained  in a state of widowed felicity; but this was not deemed proper by her  wealthy relatives.  Of course it was not difficult to find a suitor  where a pretty girl was the hook, and a large dower the bait.  Sidi Omar  came forward, and all the relatives said that it was an excellent  match--all save one, Zara's eldest sister, Hanyfa.    Hanyfa was--to speak plainly--a bad girl.  She was one of the wives of a  great officer of state--in other words, a particularly noted pirate--  named Sidi Hamet.  Now, Hamet was the Aga or commander-in-chief of the  cavalry.  He was an ambitious man, and a rival of Sidi Omar in this  respect.  Of course he hated Omar, and so did his wife Hanyfa, hence her  objection to him as her sister's husband.  But neither she nor Hamet  could stay the marriage; they therefore made up their minds to endure  it.    One thing that struck and surprised Mrs Langley was the extreme  fairness of many of the Moorish ladies; some of whom were quite as fair  as Europeans, and very beautiful, with much finer eyes than those of the  more northern belles.    Having laid aside the shroud-like veils which Moorish ladies wear when  exposed to the slightest chance of meeting the gaze of man, they now  stood confessed in all the magnificence of Oriental taste.  It is  impossible to describe the dazzling splendour of the jewels with which  their costumes absolutely blazed; especially those in the little golden  caps, or salmas, which some of them wore.  There were bouquets of roses,  jessamine, peacock's-feathers, and butterflies, formed of diamonds,  rubies, emeralds, and other precious gems.  We do not draw on our  imagination here, good reader.  It is probable that if a comparison had  been instituted, these pirates could have far outshone any court of  Europe in the matter of jewellery.    Of course no gentlemen were present.  It is one of the drawbacks of  Mohammedan female life that the ladies can never enjoy the satisfaction  of displaying themselves to male admirers, with the exception of  husbands, fathers, and brothers.  How far the display of themselves to  each other is attended with pleasure remains a doubtful point--  especially when we consider that jealousy has not yet been quite  eradicated from the female human breast.    However, on the occasion of which we write, most of the assembled ladies  appeared to be highly delighted with each other.  They were all very  merry too, and, being little better than children as regards  intellectual training, they were particularly childlike in their  merriment.    As the wife of the British consul was a lady of some importance just  then, (the consul being high in favour with the Dey), she was received  with becoming ceremony, and conducted to a seat next the bride.  This  seat, like the seats of Orientals in general, was simply a cushion laid  on the marble floor.  Seating herself with some difficulty in the  Moorish fashion, she proceeded to pay some compliments to the bride in  English and French, but as Zara knew neither of these languages, she  shook her head, smiled, and returned some compliments in Turkish;  whereupon Mrs Langley shook her head and smiled.  The rest of the  company, from infection probably, nodded to each other also, and smiled.  Two or three pretty young and rather stout girls turned aside, and went  the length of giggling.    Fortunately at this point an interpreter was brought forward in the  person of an Italian slave, a good-looking middle-aged lady, who  understood French, and who, during a servitude of ten years, had also  acquired Turkish.    Compliments were now bandied to and fro with great volubility, without  any introductory references to weather, and much notice was taken of  little Agnes, whose appearance was the cause of some good-natured  criticism among the Algerine belles.  As the costume of these latter,--  with much variety in colour and detail,--bore strong general resemblance  to that of the bride of Rais Ali, it is not necessary to describe it  more minutely.    Coffee and sweetmeats were now served, the former in exquisitely  delicate porcelain cups, so small that they might have been easily  mistaken for part of a doll's establishment.  They had neither handles  nor saucers, and were prevented from burning the fingers by being  inserted into what we may style egg-cups of beautiful gold and silver  filigree.  The coffee was too thick to suit the European palate, being  ground in a fashion peculiar to the Moors.  It was also too sweet.    There was present a younger sister of the bride, who had not only a  tendency, but had already attained in an unusual degree, to the  possession of _embonpoint_ and was appropriately named Fatma.  She wore  the salma, a dazzling little golden cap, in token of being still  unmarried.  She seemed much captivated with little Agnes.  No wonder,  for, in the simplicity of a pure white dress, and with her fair curls  streaming down her cheeks, unadorned save by one little blush rose, she  looked like an ethereal spirit dropped into the midst of the garish  party.    Fatma got up suddenly and whispered to her mother.    \"My little girl,\" said the Moorish lady, through the interpreter,  \"thinks your daughter would look _so_ pretty in our costume.\"    \"I have no doubt she would,\" replied Mrs Langley, glancing with some  pride at Agnes.    \"She asks if you will allow her to be dressed just now in the Moorish  fashion.\"    \"If there is sufficient time,\" said Mrs Langley, with an amused smile.    \"Oh, plenty of time,\" cried Fatma, who immediately seized the not  unwilling Agnes by the hand, and ran off with her.    Opposite to Zara sat her sister Hanyfa, who looked pretty and innocent  enough just then, though Mrs Langley was struck by her look of superior  intelligence, and a certain sharpness of glance which might almost have  been styled suspicious.    The consul's lady was about to address her, but was interrupted by the  entrance of several dancing-women, who immediately claimed the undivided  attention of the company.    One of these carried a sort of guitar, another an earthenware drum  covered at one end with parchment, and a third a large tambourine, while  a fourth prepared to dance.    Of the dancing we need say little.  It was unworthy of the name.  There  was little motion of the feet, and a good deal of waving of a kerchief  held in each hand.  The music was still less worthy of note; its chief  feature being noise.  Nevertheless, the Moorish ladies, knowing no  better, enjoyed it extremely, and Mrs Langley enjoyed it  sympathetically.  These women were professionals, the ladies themselves  taking no part in the dancing.    After this the bride ascended by steps to one of the shelves or stone  recesses, which formed convenient sofas or couches round the walls of  the apartment, and there, seated on cushions, submitted to be arrayed in  bridal apparel.  None but a lady's pen could do full justice to her  stupendous toilet.  We shall therefore do no more than state that the  ludicrously high head-dress, in particular, was a thing of unimaginable  splendour, and that her ornaments generally were so heavy as to render  her incapable of walking without support.    While this was going on in the chamber of state, a very different, but  not less remarkable, transformation was being wrought in Fatma's own  private apartment, where she and several of her Algerine companions,  assisted by a coal-black slave-girl, named Zooloo, converted innocent  little Agnes into a Moor.    Of course conversation with the heroine of the hour was impossible, but  this mattered, little to Agnes, for she could converse quite powerfully  with her eyes, and her young friends chattered more than enough among  themselves.    Standing over her with a formidable pair of scissors, and grasping her  front hair with her left hand, the coal-black Zooloo said--    \"Stand still, you white thing, till I perform my duty.\"    Of course she said it only by her looks; and Agnes quite understood her.    Next moment a whole cluster of golden ringlets fell to the ground.  For  one moment Agnes's eyes and mouth resembled three round O's.  She felt  that something telling had been done, and thoughts of her mother flashed  into her mind, but Fatma's pretty little round face, with no eyes to  speak of owing to laughter, caused her to smile and then to laugh  heartily.    Having brushed the front hair over her forehead, and cut it straight  across, the energetic Zooloo next painted her eyebrows black with a  substance called kohl, causing them to meet"]]]
