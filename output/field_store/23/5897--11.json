[Footnote 26: M. Comte, one of the acute and                     courageous editors of the Censor, was chosen by the                     general as his \"counsel.\" General Fressinet was his                     advocate. (According to the forms of the French                     courts of judicature, the counsel assists by his                     advice, the advocate pleads.) This officer, equally                     distinguished by his firmness, his talents, and his                     bravery, was afterwards punished and exiled on                     account of the generous assistance which he gave on                     this important occasion to General Excelmans, his                     fellow soldier and friend.]    Here I shall stop. It would be of no further use to lengthen the  history and the investigation of the absurd tyranny of the government.  If we trace the progress of the principles successively enounced by  the ministry, and the actions of which they were the authors, we shall  see that they had formed and executed the project of re-establishing  the old monarchy, and of overturning the constitutional government  either by artifice or by main force. The royal charter was spurned by  them, and they trampled without scruple on the civil and political  rights which it consecrated. Every guarantee given to the army, the  magistracy, the public functionaries, or the nation, was forgotten,  attacked, or violated. Our national glory was insulted; public feeling  was wounded. The manners and customs and opinions of the new era were  all treated with harshness: all ranks and classes of citizens  experienced those vexations which filled them with discontent. By  injustice and bad faith the government deprived the King of our  confidence and love, and caused the restoration of the Emperor to  become the hope of the nation. In spite of the obstacles experienced  by the ministry, in spite of the affronts to which they had been  subjected, in spite of the retrograde steps which they had been  compelled to take, they still clung to the baneful system which they  had fostered; and, bigoted to these plans, they continued to persevere  in those errors which recalled Napoleon from his exile, just as  Napoleon persevered in the errors which recalled the Bourbons back  from theirs.    But whilst the storm was gathering in France, how was Napoleon  employed? Ambition had taken flight, and he was seen to prefer a life  of unostentatious retirement to all his former grandeurs. Repose had  greater charms for him than the noble turmoil of war; and his genius,  no longer teeming with meditation, yielded to the pleasures of  retirement. The study of botany, the cares of his household, the  plantations which he had made, and those which he was still planning,  beguiled his hours[27]; and, like the Roman Diocletian, he might have  said to those who suspected that he longed in secret after the throne,  \"Come and see me in my retirement: I will show you the gardens which I  have planted, and you will talk no more to me about the empire.\"                       [Footnote 27: It has been alleged, but without                     foundation, that he retained his taste for military                     exercises. Not one review took place during his                     residence at Porto Ferrajo; arms seemed to have no                     attractions for him.]    Napoleon, during the early part of his retirement in Elba, felt only a  vague desire of reigning. Grieved by the miseries of France, the  country which he loved so truly, wearied by the vicissitudes of  fortune, disgusted with mankind, he feared that, if he attempted to  seize the sceptre again, he should involve France and himself in new  troubles; and, without abandoning his expectation of re-ascending the  throne, he resolved to allow his resolutions to be guided by futurity.    The turn taken by public affairs soon roused the Emperor from this  state of indifference and hesitation. At first he hoped, and I have  heard him say so, that the Bourbons, instructed by adversity, would  confer liberty and happiness upon the nation. But when he witnessed  the power which was bestowed upon the priesthood, the emigrants, and  the courtiers, he foresaw that the very same causes which had produced  the first revolution, would soon occasion a second. From that period  he watched the continent; nor did he lose sight, even for a moment, of  the congress, or of France, or of the Bourbons. He could tell the  talents[28], the principles, the vices, and the virtues of all those  who had acquired the confidence of Louis XVIII, either by intrusion or  by favour. He could measure the degrees of influence which each was  capable of acquiring and exercising, and he calculated beforehand on  the errors which they would inevitably induce his docile successor to  commit.                       [Footnote 28: It is well known that there was not a                     single individual of note in the service, either of                     his allies or of his enemies, whose strong and weak                     points were not perfectly understood by Napoleon.]    Napoleon now employed himself again in reading the public journals of  France and of foreign countries; he read assiduously all periodical  works of a political tendency; he studied these productions; he  investigated them with acuteness, and he could well divine the meaning  of a writer who was compelled to be silent, and conjecture the nature  of intelligence which an editor was forced to suppress.    Strangers of distinction, and particularly the English, were received  by Napoleon with affability and kindness, and he used to talk freely  with his visitors on public affairs. He knew how to draw them out, and  to lead them to expatiate on points which he wished to penetrate; and  he seldom failed to obtain much useful information from those  interviews. By these simple methods Napoleon obtained a correct idea  of the events which were taking place on the continent; he was too  well acquainted with revolutions not to be sensible that the sway of  events would open the gates of France, and admit him; and he was too  wary to enter into a private correspondence with his partisans, when  any accident might have revealed his secret wishes, and have afforded  a pretext to his enemies for attacking his independence and his  liberty.    Napoleon thus waited in silence till the fated time of his  re-appearance in France should arrive, when a French Officer[29],  disguised as a sailor, disembarked at Porto Ferrajo.                       [Footnote 29: This officer is the person who is                     named in the declaration made on the 15th of March                     to the prince of Essling, then governor of the 8th                     military division, by Monsieur P*****, who landed                     with Napoleon from the Isle of Elba, and was                     arrested at Toulon by order of the prefect of the                     department of the Var.]    Some few days before this Officer set out to join the army in the year  1815, he gave over to me the manuscript narrative of his voyage to the  Isle of Elba. \"To you,\" added he, \"I deliver my history, which is also  that of the revolution of the 20th of March. As the Emperor, when  regaining his throne, did not think fit to speak of me, I was  therefore bound to be silent; but I am as eager to live in the memory  of after-ages as he can possibly be[30]. It is my wish that posterity  may learn, that I too shared in the glorious enterprise of subverting  the Bourbon government, and of bringing back the Emperor. My mind  misgives me. I have a presentiment that I shall die in this campaign.  Keep my manuscript, and promise to publish it when the time shall  arrive.\" I gave my word accordingly; and the forebodings of my friend  were realised, for he was killed at Waterloo.                       [Footnote 30: At Malmaison the Emperor asked me                     what had become of M. Z***. I answered that he had                     been killed on Mount St. Jean: \"Well,\" answered the                     Emperor, \"he is happy. But pray did he tell you                     that he had been at Elba?\"--\"Yes, Sire; he even                     entrusted me with the narrative of his voyage, and                     of the conversations which he had with your                     Majesty.\"--\"You must give me this narrative: I will                     take it with me: it will help me in the composition                     of my memoirs.\"--\"Sire, it is no longer in my                     possession.\"--\"What have you done with it? you must                     get it back, and let me have it to-morrow.\"--\"I                     have deposited it with a friend, who happens to be                     absent from Paris.\"--\"So the narrative will be                     handed about at the mercy of the world.\"--\"No,                     Sire. It is inclosed in an envelope, and deposited                     in a box of which I keep the key; but if I should                     not be able to deliver it to your Majesty, before                     your Majesty's departure, it will yet come to your                     knowledge, for I intend to publish it according to                     the last wishes of M. Z***, unless your Majesty                     forbids me.\"--\"No; I allow you to print it, only                     leave out whatever may tend to compromise those who                     have displayed their attachment towards me. If Z***                     has made a faithful report of all that passed, the                     people will know that I sacrificed myself for their                     good; and that it was not the love of power which                     brought me again into France, but that I yielded to               "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#13)"],[1,"law was another thing that  occasioned great surprise during Mr. Roosevelt's term as Police  Commissioner. In the past, saloons had been almost as wide open on  Sundays as on week days. On account of the cosmopolitan character of the  population it was thought that to close up the saloons on Sundays would  be impossible. But the police force was given strict orders, and on one  Sunday in June, 1895, New York City had the first \"dry\" Sunday that it  could remember in many years.    This \"dry\" Sunday provoked a new storm of opposition, especially from  many of foreign birth, who were used to getting liquor as easily on that  day as on any other. More threats were made against the vigorous  commissioner, and on two occasions dynamite bombs were placed in his  desk, evidently with the hope that they would explode and blow him to  pieces. But the bombs were found in time, and no damage was done, and  Theodore Roosevelt paid scant attention to them.    After that he was attacked in a new way. Some of the politicians laid  traps for him whereby they hoped to bring discredit to his management of  the department. The fight grew very hot and very bitter, and he was  accused of doing many things, \"just for the looks of them,\" rather than  to benefit the public at large. But he kept on his way, and at last the  opposition were silenced to such an extent that they merely growled  behind his back.    For many years a large number of shiftless and often lawless men, and  women too, were attracted to the metropolis because of the \"Tramps'  Lodging Houses\" located there. These resorts were continually filled by  vagrants who would not work and who were a constant menace to society at  large.    \"We must get rid of those lodging houses,\" said Mr. Roosevelt. \"They  simply breed crime. No respectable man or woman, no matter how poor,  will enter them.\"    \"But we'll have to have some sort of shelter for the poor people,\" said  others.    \"To be sure--for those who are deserving. The others should be driven  off and discouraged,\" answered Mr. Roosevelt. And one by one the tramps'  lodging places were abolished. In their place the Board of Charities  opened a Municipal Lodging House, where those who were deserving were  received, were made to bathe, and given proper shelter and nourishment.    A story is told that, during the excitement attending the closing of  saloons on Sunday, a friend came to Mr. Roosevelt and told about hearing  some saloon-keepers plotting to harm him.    \"What can they do?\" demanded the Police Commissioner.    \"I am afraid they can do a good deal,\" was the answer. \"Each of those  men has a barkeeper who has been in jail for various crimes. They may  attack you some dark night and kill you.\"    \"Perhaps I won't give them the chance,\" answered the man who had been on  many a dangerous hunt in the wild West. \"If they can shoot, so can I.\"    \"But they may sneak up behind you and knock you out,\" insisted the  visitor.    \"Well, if they do that, I shall have died doing my duty,\" was the calm  answer made by the future hero of the Rough Riders.          CHAPTER XI    APPOINTED FIRST ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY--THE CONDITION OF  AFFAIRS IN CUBA--PREPARING FOR WAR--THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S RESOLVE      While Theodore Roosevelt was serving as Police Commissioner of the city  of New York, William McKinley ran for the Presidency of the United  States the first time and was elected.    The young commissioner was a firm upholder of McKinley, for he did not  believe in \"free silver\" as it was called, but in \"sound money,\" which  meant that in the future, as in the past, all national indebtedness  should be made payable in gold, instead of in gold and silver, as many  desired.    As soon as the new President was inaugurated, March 4, 1897, he  appointed Hon. John D. Long to be Secretary of the Navy. Mr. Long knew  Theodore Roosevelt well, and also knew of the \"History of the Naval War  of 1812,\" which the energetic author and commissioner had written.    \"He is just the man we need here,\" said Mr. Long to President McKinley.  \"He has made a study of the navy, and he is not afraid of work,\" and  without further delay Theodore Roosevelt was asked to resign his  position in the metropolis and come to Washington, where he was duly  installed as First Assistant Secretary of the Navy.    In his new position, certainly a high one for such a young man to  occupy, Mr. Roosevelt had much to do. As first assistant, nearly the  whole responsibility of the real workings of the department fell upon  his shoulders. He took up these responsibilities manfully, and how well  he succeeded in the work, history has abundantly proved.    \"It was Roosevelt's work that made Dewey's victory at Manila possible,\"  one who knew of the inner workings of the department has said, and  another has said that the victory off Santiago Bay was also due in part  to Roosevelt's watchfulness over the ships that took part in that  conflict.    At Washington the Assistant Secretary found an era of extravagance equal  to that which he had discovered in New York. The Navy Department was  paying dearly for almost everything it bought, and many laborers and  others were drawing high wages for doing little or no work. Against this  Theodore Roosevelt set his face uncompromisingly, so that inside of a  year the actual saving to our government was twenty-five per cent. When  it is remembered that the Navy Department spends each year millions of  dollars, something of what such a saving means can be realized.    For many years our country had been at peace with the whole world, but  now a war cloud showed itself on the horizon, scarcely visible at first,  but gradually growing larger and larger. Those at Washington watched it  with great anxiety, wondering if it would burst, and what would be the  result.    Cuba had been fighting for liberty for years. It was under Spanish rule,  and the people were frightfully oppressed. To Spain they paid vast sums  of money and got but little in return. Money that should have gone into  improvements--that should have supplied good roads and schools--went  into the pockets of the royalty of Spain. When a Cuban tried to  remonstrate, he could scarcely get a hearing, and this state of affairs  went from bad to worse until, in sheer desperation, the Cubans declared  war on the mother-country, just as in 1776 our own nation threw off the  yoke of England.    As my young readers know, Cuba lies only a short distance from the  southeast coast of Florida. Being so close, it was but natural that our  people should take an interest in the struggle at hand. Everybody  sympathized with the Cubans, and some made offers of assistance. Then,  when many Cubans were on the verge of starvation, we voted to send them  relief in the way of something to eat.    The action of the United States was viewed with suspicion by Spain. The  people of that country were certain we wanted to help Cuba only in order  to \"gobble her up afterward,\" as the saying went. Such was not our  intention at all, and total Cuban liberty to-day testifies to that fact.    Not knowing how far matters might go, President McKinley and his  advisers deemed it wise to prepare for the worst. This meant to put the  army and navy on the best possible footing in the least possible time.    It was felt that should war come, it would be fought largely on the sea,  and nobody realized this more than did Theodore Roosevelt. He was active  day and night in the pursuit of his duty, seeing to it that this ship or  that was properly manned, and this fortification and that put in proper  order to resist attack. Our ships were in all parts of the world, on the  Atlantic and the Pacific, in the far north and the far south, in  European waters and Hong Kong Harbor. Each had to be supplied with coal  and ammunition and with provisions. Those that were \"out of commission,\"  that is, laid up, generally for repairs, were put into commission with  all speed. A thousand contracts had to be inspected, judged, and passed  upon. Outwardly the Navy Department at Washington was moving along as  peacefully as ever, internally it was more active than it had been at  any time since the great Civil War.    \"War may come at any moment,\" said Mr. Roosevelt to his friends. \"And if  it does come, there is nothing like being prepared for it.\"    About one thing Theodore Roosevelt was very particular. In the past,  gun practice on board of our war-ships had been largely a matter of  simply going through the motions of handling the guns.    \"This will not do,\" said the Assistant Secretary. \"Our gunners will  never make good marksmen in that way. They must practise with powder and  ball, shot and shell.\" And after that they did. Such practice cost a  round sum of money, and the department was criticised for its  wastefulness in this direction; but the worth of it was afterward proven  when Commodore Dewey sank the Spanish ships in Manila Bay, and the  Atlantic Squadron likewise destroyed the enemy's ships that were trying  to escape from Santiago Harbor.    In those days at Washington, Theodore Roosevelt made a warm, personal  friend of Dr. Leonard Wood. Dr. Wood was an army surgeon, who had seen  considerable active service while under General Miles in the campaigns  against the Apache Indians. Mr. Roosevelt has himself told how he and  Dr. Wood would often, after office hours, take long walks out of the  city, or play foot-ball, or go snow-skating when the weather permitted,  and during such pastimes their conversation was invariably about the  situation in Cuba, and what each intended to do should war break out.    \"If war actually comes, I intend, by hook or by crook, to get out into  the field,\" said Dr. Wood.    \"I shall go with you,\" answered Theodore Roosevelt. \"No more office work  for me if there is any fighting to be done.\"    In the meantime, as already mentioned, matters in Cuba were rapidly  approaching "]]]
