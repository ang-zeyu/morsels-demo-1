[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#13)"],[1,"niche of unusual but very  beautiful character; these niches rest upon sculptured corbels  representing some striking incidents of St. Etheldreda's life, by  beginning at the right-hand side of the north-west arch, and  continuing our course to the right-hand round the Octagon, we may  examine them in detail.         The first represents her marriage.         The second, her taking the veil at the Monastery of       Coldingham at the hands of Wilfred, bishop of York; her       crown laid upon the altar.         The third, her pilgrim's staff taking root and bearing       leaves and branches over her whilst she slept by the way.         The fourth, her preservation, with her attendant nuns, on a       rock surrounded by a miraculous inundation, when pursued by       the king and his attendants.         The fifth, her installation as abbess of Ely, by Wilfred.         The sixth, her death and burial.         The seventh, a legendary tale of one Brithstan delivered       from bonds by her merits.         The eighth, the translation of her body.    These were probably placed there to break the apparent great  preponderance of vertical lines. The vaulting is of wood, and its  fan-shaped compartments terminate at a distance from the centre, thus  allowing an aperture thirty feet wide, over which rises the Lantern,  an exact octagon, having on each of its sides a large pointed window  of four openings with rich tracery, all filled with stained glass,  which has the effect of subduing the light; below these windows are a  series of panels with decorated heads, and under them another series  of smaller ones; above the ceiling is a chamber formerly used for  bells. The Lantern also is of English oak, and its construction a  curious piece of carpentry. The whole has been thoroughly repaired,  and in a great measure restored in exact conformity with the original,  at a considerable expense.[37]    [Footnote 37: This great work is designed as a memorial of Dean  Peacock, and a more fitting one could scarcely be found, as it is one  of the great works he had in contemplation. \"The Dean and Chapter felt  that they could not propose any record of the zealous exertions of the  late Dean, so appropriate as the restoration of the central portion of  the Cathedral Church; which, after the great improvements executed  under his superintendence in the eastern and western portions of the  fabric, would form as it were a keystone of the whole work.\"  Subscriptions amounting to about L10,000, were given by many noblemen  as well as other friends of Dean Peacock; the capitular body  contributing very largely towards the work.]    When the white and yellow-wash was cleared away from the woodwork of  the Octagon and Lantern in 1850, some remnants of ancient colouring  were discovered. In the archives of the Cathedral are preserved the  accounts of the materials used in this painting, the prices of the  colours, and the wages paid to the workmen. The name of the principal  artist was Walter; he is dignified by the name of \"Pictor,\" but he  only received Eightpence per week, \"_praeter mensam et robam_\" the  \"_roba_\" being the painter's dress of the period, which was very like  a modern gentleman's dressing gown. The colouring of this \"Walter\"  between the years 1335 and 1351 seems to have been of a very simple  character. The only evidence of designs that remained in 1850 were on  the flat panels of the vaulting, which was covered with an imitation  of ordinary gothic flowing tracery. The pattern was a series of  quatrefoils painted in stone-colour on the wood, outlined black, and  filled with green. The bosses of the Lantern, which are not carved,  had been evidently painted and gilt, but the patterns of foliage were  rough and too much injured to afford any distinct composition.    The small amount of colouring which remained on some of the mouldings  of the Octagon was principally of a bright red, but only in small  patches, the ground-work having peeled off and the colour with it.    In attempting to describe briefly the recent decoration of the Octagon  and Lantern we cannot do better than quote the substance of a paper  read during the Conference in June, 1875, explaining the history and  nature of the ornamentation which has been carried out with such  loving care and artistic skill under Gambier Parry, Esq., who designed  the whole and painted the chief figures.    \"The internal repair of the Lantern and Octagon was begun in February,  1874, and required a year for its completion. The ornamentation is in  the style of the fourteenth century. The central boss of the lantern  groining is a half-length figure of Christ in glory, considerably  above life size, and with the conventual clouding around it; it is  boldly carved in oak. The right hand is raised in the attitude of  blessing, and with the left the inner garment is drawn open to exhibit  the wound in the right side. Around this figure is painted a group of  Seraphim on a grey blue ground. The panels of the window hoods are  painted red, marking the distinction already made by the architectural  construction, and on them are painted Cherubim and golden stars. The  windows of the lantern were filled, some years ago, with coloured  glass, the colouring of which is harsh, and in strong contrast with  the mellow and rich painting of the woodwork, and injurious to the  general effect.    \"Below the windows are thirty-two openings surmounted with rich  tracery. They are filled by panels on which is painted the angel  choir. The figures are composed in groups of four, under each window,  and are represented playing mediaeval instruments. The two eastern and  two western bays are intended to be severally grouped together,  forming distinct series of eight figures. The instruments in the hands  of the figures over the transepts are the psaltery and cithern, the  regale, tabret, lute, violin, bagpipe and trumpet, (illustrating the  150th Psalm.) Below this range of figures are smaller panels, simply  ornamented with the sacred monogram, the cross and the crown, resting  on a fine and richly carved cornice, which forms the base of the  lantern. The groining of the Octagon forms eight hoods, four above the  windows, and four above the great arches of the Choir, Nave and  Transepts. Beneath these last are remarkable statues of the four  evangelists, about life size, seated in the attitude of writing, with  a pen in one hand and a long scroll in the other; a writing table by  the side of each figure with the ink horn attached to it by a strap,  and a loop to hold the pen, is very complete. The space between the  great arch and the groining of the Choir is filled with rich tracery,  on the central panel of which is painted the Crucifixion, with angels  holding the chalice and palm branch on the right and left. The long  spandrils of the groining are painted with conventional scrollwork of  leaves and flowers in a style contemporaneous with the architecture.  The monogram and crown of St. Etheldreda are found in several parts of  the ornamental design. The total expense of the decoration has been  about L2500.\"    An elegantly carved pulpit has been placed near the entrance to the  Choir; it is of Ancaster stone resting upon columns of Purbeck marble,  the front relieved by alabaster figures of St. Peter and St. Paul; the  steps are of Purbeck marble, guarded by very elaborate scrollwork in  iron. It was designed by Sir G.G. Scott, and executed by Messrs.  Rattee and Kett; the figures by Mr. Redfern, and the iron work by  Messrs. Potter and Son. It was supplied by a legacy left by the  daughter of Bishop Allen, and adds much towards the general  improvements.           *       *       *       *       *    Before leaving the Octagon the visitor would do well to contemplate  this portion of the building, as affording an extraordinary example of  the skill and judgment of the man who designed and carried into effect  so grand and unique a specimen of architecture, covering, as it does,  a large area without supporting columns; no heavy mass of stone-work  meets the eye, but the pillars, though strong and of great height are  so constructed as to give an appearance of lightness and elegance; the  vaulting is rich though simple, and the lantern above deserves notice  from its singular position, apparently without support, but starting  as it were from the ends of the ribs of the groining: taken as a whole  it may be fairly considered as without parallel in this country.    The architectural views from the Octagon in every direction are  exceedingly fine, and will repay the visitor for a pause of a few  minutes to notice them; on all sides are examples of great beauty and  variety. There are many other points in the Cathedral which afford  attractive scenes as shewn in the effects of light and shade, the  intersections of arches, perspective, &c., which may be found by the  visitor in his survey, if watched for, but we cannot undertake to  point them out.           *       *       *       *       *    The next portion of the building to which our attention is attracted  is    +The Choir,+    which, previous to 1322 was under the central Tower, and extended,  including the rood-loft, from the second column at the eastern end of  the Nave, as it now is, (it then extended one bay further eastward,)  to about the same distance, or rather more, on the opposite side; and  after the erection of the Octagon was again placed there; in 1770 it  was removed to the six eastern arches of the Cathedral, the space  under the Octagon and the two bays eastward of it being used as a  sermon-place.[38] It was again removed in 1852, and now commences at  the eastern side of the Octagon, extending to the length of seven  bays, (the stalled portion occupying three of them,) leaving the two  eastern bays as a retro-choir.    [Footnote 38: Previous to the last removal, the custom was that only  one sermon was preached"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20925"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"ons, whose good-will was partly on  this account transferred to the English colonists later. The Dutch were  not only friendly to the red men, but tried to open social and  commercial relations with the Plymouth colonists as well. Governor  Bradford replied, mildly urging the Dutch to \"clear their title\" to a  territory which the English claimed by right of discovery.    [1630-1633]    [Illustration: De Vries.]    The present State of Delaware soon became the scene of attempts at  settlement. De Vries began, in 1632, a colony on the banks of the  Delaware, but it was quickly laid waste by the savages, who had been  needlessly provoked by the insolence of the commander left in charge of  the colony. In 1633 Minuit was succeeded by Van Twiller, and a fort was  erected at Hartford, though the English claimed this country as theirs.  Emigrants from the Plymouth colony began the settlement of Windsor, in  spite of the protests of the Dutch. Long Island was invaded by  enterprising New Englanders, regardless of the claim of New Netherland  thereto.    [Illustration: Costumes of Swedes.]    This \"irrepressible conflict\" between two races was by no means abated  by the introduction of a third. As early as 1626, Gustavus Adolphus,  King of Sweden and the hero of the Thirty Years' War, had entertained  the idea of establishing colonies in America, and in pursuance of that  object had encouraged the formation of a company, not only for trading  purposes but also to secure a refuge for the \"oppressed of all  Christendom.\" To Usselinx, an Antwerp merchant, the originator of the  Dutch West India Company, belongs the honor of first suggesting to the  king this enterprise. The glorious death of Gustavus on the victorious  field of Lutzen in 1632 deferred the execution of a purpose which had  not been forgotten even in the midst of that long and arduous campaign.  But a few days before he fell, the Protestant hero had spoken of the  colonial prospect as \"the jewel of his kingdom.\"    [1638]    In 1638 Minuit, who had already figured as governor of New Netherland,  having offered his services to Sweden, was intrusted with the leadership  of the first Swedish colony to America. After a few days' stay at  Jamestown the new-comers finally reached their wished-for destination on  the west shore of the Delaware Bay and River. Proceeding up the latter,  one of their first acts was to build a fort on a little stream about two  miles from its junction with the Delaware, which they named Fort  Christina, in honor of the young queen of Sweden. Near this spot stands  the present city of Wilmington. The country from Cape Henlopen to the  falls at Trenton received the title of New Sweden.    [1650]    It was in this very year that Kieft came to supersede Van Twiller, who  had given just cause for complaint by his eagerness to enrich himself at  the expense of the West India Company. During the administration of  Kieft occurred the long and doubtful conflict with the natives detailed  in the succeeding chapter. Arbitrary and exacting, he drove the Indians  to extremities, and involved the Dutch settlements in a war which for a  time threatened their destruction. Not till 1645 was peace  re-established, and in 1647 the unpopular governor was recalled. In 1647  not more than three hundred fighting men remained in the whole province.  Its total population was between fifteen hundred and two thousand. In  1652 New Amsterdam had a population of seven or eight hundred. In 1664  Stuyvesant put the number in the province at ten thousand, about fifteen  hundred of whom were in New Amsterdam.    [Illustration: The old Stadt Huys at New Amsterdam.]    [Illustration: European Provinces 1655. Map of the eastern North  America. Latitude 25 to 50 North, Longitude 75 to 95 West.]    [1655-1663]    The next governor, Stuyvesant, was the last and much the ablest ruler  among those who directed the destinies of New Netherland. His  administration embraced a period of seventeen years, during which he  renewed the former friendly relations with the savages, made a treaty  with New England, giving up pretensions to Connecticut as well as  relinquishing the east end of Long Island, and compelled the Swedes, in  1655, to acknowledge the Dutch supremacy. It was while he was absent on  his expedition against the Swedes, leaving New Amsterdam unprotected,  that the river Indians, watchful of their opportunity, invaded and laid  waste the surrounding country. In 1663 the savages attacked the village  on the Esopus, now Kingston, and almost destroyed it. It was not until  the energetic governor made a vigorous campaign against the Esopus  tribe, whom he completely subdued, that peace was established on a firm  footing.    [Illustration: New Amsterdam in the middle of the Seventeenth Century.]    [Illustration: The Duke of York, afterwards James II.]    [1664]    But the Dutch sway in their little part of the New World was about to  end. The English had never given over their claim to the country by  virtue of their first discovery of the North American continent. The New  Netherlanders, tired of arbitrary rule, sighed for the larger freedom of  their New England neighbors. Therefore, when in 1664 Charles II. granted  to his brother, the Duke of York, the territory which the Dutch were  occupying, and sent a fleet to demand its submission, the English  invader was welcomed.    [Illustration: The Tomb of Stuyvesant. \"In this Vault lies buried PETRUS  STUYVESANT late Captain Genral & Governor in Chief of Amsterdam, In New  Netherland now called New York and the Dutch West India Islands. Died  A.D. 1672 Aged 80 years.\"]    Almost the only resistance came from the stout-hearted governor, who  could hardly be dissuaded from fighting the English single-handed, and  who signed the agreement to surrender only when his magistrates had, in  spite of him, agreed to the proposed terms. But the founders of the  Empire State have left an indelible impress upon the Union, which their  descendants have helped to strengthen and perpetuate. They were honest,  thrifty, devout, tolerant of the opinions of others. As Holland  sheltered the English Puritans from ecclesiastical intolerance, so New  Netherland welcomed within her borders the victims of New England  bigotry and narrowness.        CHAPTER VIII.    THE FIRST INDIAN WARS    [1637]    Troubles between the Indians and the whites arose so early as 1636. John  Oldham was murdered on Block Island by a party of Pequot Indians. Vane  of Massachusetts sent Endicott to inflict punishment. The Pequots in  turn attacked the fort at Saybrook, and in 1637 threatened Wethersfield.  They were planning a union with the Narragansets for the destruction of  the English, when Roger Williams informed the Massachusetts colony of  their designs and, at the urgent request of the governor and council,  hastened to the chief of the Narragansets and dissuaded him from  entering into the alliance.    The moment was critical. Captain Mason with about ninety English and  seventy Mohegans, under their sachem, Uncas (a sub chief, who with his  district, Mohegan, had rebelled against the Pequot sachem, Sassacus),  was sent from Hartford down the Connecticut River. Entering the Sound,  he sailed past the mouth of the Thames and anchored in Narragansett Bay,  at the foot of Tower Hill, near Point Judith. He knew that keen-eyed  scouts from the Pequot stronghold on the west bank of the Mystic River,  near Groton, had, as his three little ships skirted the shore, been  watching him, to give warning of his approach. He therefore resolved to  come upon the enemy from an unlooked-for quarter. This plan was directly  contrary to his instructions, which required him to land at the mouth of  the Thames and attack the fort from the west side. He hoped, marching  westward across the country, to take the enemy by surprise on their  unprotected rear, while the Indians, trusting in the strength of their  fort, as it fronted the west, should believe themselves secure.    [Illustration: Attack on the Fort of the Pequots on the Mystic River  \"The figure of the Indians fort or Palizado in NEW ENGLAND And the maner  of the destroying It by Captayne Underhill and Captayne Manson\"]    Thirteen men had been sent back to the Thames with the vessels. Two  hundred Narragansets had joined the expedition, though their sachem,  Miantonomoh, thought the English too weak to fight the dreaded Pequots.  Mason's enterprise was admirably planned, and he was as fortunate as he  was bold and skilful. He divided his men into two parties. One, led by  Underhill, climbed the steep ascent on the south side of the Indian  village; the other, directed by Mason himself, mounted the northern  slope. The garrison was buried in slumber, made more profound by  carousals the preceding night. One Indian was heard to cry out  \"Englishmen\" before the volley of musketry from the attacking force told  that the white enemy had come. Mason entered a wigwam and fought, as did  the others, hand-to-hand with the now awakened and desperate foe. Coming  out with a firebrand and exclaiming \"We must burn them,\" he set fire to  the wigwam. The flames were quickly carried through the fort by the  northeast wind. Underhill from his side applied powder. So rapidly did  the flames spread that the English had difficulty in making good their  escape, while the Pequots who escaped the sword were doomed to perish by  fire. In an hour's time from four hundred to six hundred had fallen,  more than half of them women and children. Of the Englishmen two were  killed and about twenty wounded. In this dreadful slaughter the  Narragansets had little share, for they had shown such fear that Mason  had said to Uncas, \"Tell them not to fly, but stand at what distance  they please and see whether Englishmen will now fight or not.\"    [Illustration: Attack on the Pequot Fort.]    With the approach of day three hundred Pequots advanced from a"]]]
