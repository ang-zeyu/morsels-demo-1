But, even before the middle of the seventeenth  century, the Society, proud of its services and confident in its  strength, had become impatient of the yoke. A generation of Jesuits  sprang up, who looked for protection and guidance rather to the court of  France than to the court of Rome; and this disposition was not a little  strengthened when Innocent the Eleventh was raised to the papal throne.    The Jesuits were, at that time, engaged in a war to the death against an  enemy whom they had at first disdained, but whom they had at length been  forced to regard with respect and fear. Just when their prosperity  was at the height, they were braved by a handful of opponents, who had  indeed no influence with the rulers of this world, but who were strong  in religious faith and intellectual energy. Then followed a long, a  strange, a glorious conflict of genius against power. The Jesuit called  cabinets, tribunals, universities to his aid; and they responded to  the call. Port Royal appealed, not in vain, to the hearts and to  the understandings of millions. The dictators of Christendom found  themselves, on a sudden, in the position of culprits. They were  arraigned on the charge of having systematically debased the standard of  evangelical morality, for the purpose of increasing their own influence;  and the charge was enforced in a manner which at once arrested the  attention of the whole world: for the chief accuser was Blaise Pascal.  His intellectual powers were such as have rarely been bestowed on any  of the children of men; and the vehemence of the zeal which animated him  was but too well proved by the cruel penances and vigils under which his  macerated frame sank into an early grave. His spirit was the spirit of  Saint Bernard: but the delicacy of his wit, the purity, the energy, the  simplicity of his rhetoric, had never been equalled, except by the great  masters of Attic eloquence. All Europe read and admired, laughed and  wept. The Jesuits attempted to reply: but their feeble answers were  received by the public with shouts of mockery. They wanted, it is true,  no talent or accomplishment into which men can be drilled by elaborate  discipline; but such discipline, though it may bring out the powers of  ordinary minds, has a tendency to suffocate, rather than to develop,  original genius. It was universally acknowledged that, in the literary  contest, the Jansenists were completely victorious. To the Jesuits  nothing was left but to oppress the sect which they could not confute.  Lewis the Fourteenth was now their chief support. His conscience had,  from boyhood, been in their keeping; and he had learned from them to  abhor Jansenism quite as much as he abhorred Protestantism, and very  much more than he abhorred Atheism. Innocent the Eleventh, on the other  hand, leaned to the Jansenist opinions. The consequence was, that the  Society found itself in a situation never contemplated by its founder.  The Jesuits were estranged from the Supreme Pontiff; and they were  closely allied with a prince who proclaimed himself the champion of the  Gallican liberties and the enemy of Ultramontane pretensions. Thus  the Order became in England an instrument of the designs of Lewis, and  laboured, with a success which the Roman Catholics afterwards long  and bitterly deplored, to widen the breach between the King and the  Parliament, to thwart the Nuncio, to undermine the power of the Lord  Treasurer, and to support the most desperate schemes of Tyrconnel.    Thus on one side were the Hydes and the whole body of Tory churchmen,  Powis and all the most respectable noblemen and gentlemen of the King's  own faith, the States General, the House of Austria, and the Pope. On  the other side were a few Roman Catholic adventurers, of broken fortune  and tainted reputation, backed by France and by the Jesuits.    The chief representative of the Jesuits at Whitehall was an  English brother of the Order, who had, during some time, acted as  Viceprovincial, who had been long regarded by James with peculiar  favour, and who had lately been made Clerk of the Closet. This man,  named Edward Petre, was descended from an honourable family. His manners  were courtly: his speech was flowing and plausible; but he was weak and  vain, covetous and ambitious. Of all the evil counsellors who had access  to the royal ear, he bore, perhaps, the largest part in the ruin of the  House of Stuart.    The obstinate and imperious nature of the King gave great advantages to  those who advised him to be firm, to yield nothing, and to make himself  feared. One state maxim had taken possession of his small understanding,  and was not to be dislodged by reason. To reason, indeed, he was not in  the habit of attending. His mode of arguing, if it is to be so called,  was one not uncommon among dull and stubborn persons, who are accustomed  to be surrounded by their inferiors. He asserted a proposition; and,  as often as wiser people ventured respectfully to show that it was  erroneous, he asserted it again, in exactly the same words, and  conceived that, by doing so, he at once disposed of all objections.  [57] \"I will make no concession,\" he often repeated; \"my father made  concessions, and he was beheaded.\" [58] If it were true that concession had  been fatal to Charles the First, a man of sense would have known that a  single experiment is not sufficient to establish a general rule even  in sciences much less complicated than the science of government; that,  since the beginning of the world, no two political experiments were ever  made of which all the conditions were exactly alike; and that the only  way to learn civil prudence from history is to examine and compare an  immense number of cases. But, if the single instance on which the King  relied proved anything, it proved that he was in the wrong. There can be  little doubt that, if Charles had frankly made to the Short Parliament,  which met in the spring of 1640, but one half of the concessions which  he made, a few months later, to the Long Parliament, he would have  lived and died a powerful King. On the other hand, there can be no doubt  whatever that, if he had refused to make any concession to the Long  Parliament, and had resorted to arms in defence of the ship money and  of the Star Chamber, he would have seen, in the hostile ranks, Hyde and  Falkland side by side with Hollis and Hampden. But, in truth, he would  not have been able to resort to arms; for nor twenty Cavaliers would  have joined his standard. It was to his large concessions alone that he  owed the support of that great body of noblemen and gentlemen who fought  so long and so gallantly in his cause. But it would have been useless to  represent these things to James.    Another fatal delusion had taken possession of his mind, and was never  dispelled till it had ruined him. He firmly believed that, do what  he might, the members of the Church of England would act up to their  principles. It had, he knew, been proclaimed from ten thousand pulpits,  it had been solemnly declared by the University of Oxford, that even  tyranny as frightful as that of the most depraved of the Caesars did not  justify subjects in resisting the royal authority; and hence he was weak  enough to conclude that the whole body of Tory gentlemen and clergymen  would let him plunder, oppress, and insult them without lifting an  arm against him. It seems strange that any man should have passed his  fiftieth year without discovering that people sometimes do what they  think wrong: and James had only to look into his own heart for abundant  proof that even a strong sense of religious duty will not always prevent  frail human beings from indulging their passions in defiance of divine  laws, and at the risk of awful penalties. He must have been conscious  that, though he thought adultery sinful, he was an adulterer: but  nothing could convince him that any man who professed to think rebellion  sinful would ever, in any extremity, be a rebel. The Church of England  was, in his view, a passive victim, which he might, without danger,  outrage and torture at his pleasure; nor did he ever see his error till  the Universities were preparing to coin their plate for the purpose of  supplying the military chest of his enemies, and till a Bishop, long  renowned for loyalty, had thrown aside his cassock, girt on a sword, and  taken the command of a regiment of insurgents.    In these fatal follies the King was artfully encouraged by a minister  who had been an Exclusionist, and who still called himself a Protestant,  the Earl of Sunderland. The motives and conduct of this unprincipled  politician have often been misrepresented. He was, in his own lifetime,  accused by the Jacobites of having, even before the beginning of the  reign of James, determined to bring about a revolution in favour of  the Prince of Orange, and of having, with that view, recommended a  succession of outrages on the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of  the realm. This idle story has been repeated down to our own days by  ignorant writers. But no well informed historian, whatever might be his  prejudices, has condescended to adopt it: for it rests on no evidence  whatever; and scarcely any evidence would convince reasonable men that  Sunderland deliberately incurred guilt and infamy in order to bring  about a change by which it was clear that he could not possibly be a  gainer, and by which, in fact, he lost immense wealth and influence. Nor  is there the smallest reason for resorting to so strange a hypothesis.  For the truth lies on the surface. Crooked as this man's course was, the  law which determined it was simple. His conduct is to be ascribed to the  alternate influence of cupidity and fear on a mind highly susceptible of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#13)"],[1,"thing, however, compared with the power of laying  our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes  of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which  needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal  with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who  is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone  can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the  slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant  among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning  to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these  men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I  have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all  the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present  I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you  without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\"    Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,  or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had  flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other's beady eyes  glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to  speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman  of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and  unsavoury person.    \"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab  downstairs.\"    \"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don't you introduce this pattern  at Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from  a drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an  instant.\"    \"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only  find the man to put them on.\"    \"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well  help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"    I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about  to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.  There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and  began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the  room.    \"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling over  his task, and never turning his head.    The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put  down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the  jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.    \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to Mr.  Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.\"    The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time  to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes'  triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman's  dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had  appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might  have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,  the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled  himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but  before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon  him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then  commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that  the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the  convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands  were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of  blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until  Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and  half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of  no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his  feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and  panting.    \"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It will serve to take him to  Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\" he continued, with a pleasant smile,  \"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to  put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I  will refuse to answer them.\"            PART II. _The Country of the Saints._          CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.      IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies  an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a  barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to  Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado  upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature  always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises  snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are  swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged canons; and there are  enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are  grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common  characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.    There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees  or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other  hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight  of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their  prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily  through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark  ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These  are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.    In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from  the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach  stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of  alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On  the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,  with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of  country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.  There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,  grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,  there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but  silence--complete and heart-subduing silence.    It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad  plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one  sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is  lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down  by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered  white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull  deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some  large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have  belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one  may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those  who had fallen by the wayside.    Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,  eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance  was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.  An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer  to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown  parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his  long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his  eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while  the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a  skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet  his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry  and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,  which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it  was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was  dying--dying from hunger and from thirst.    He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little  elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great  salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage  mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might  indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there  was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild  questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to  an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \"Why  not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\" he muttered,  as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.    Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,  and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried  slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for  his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some  little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little  moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very  bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.    \"You've hurt me!\" said a childish voice reproachfully.    \"Have I though,\" the man answered penitently, \"I didn't go for to do  it.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty  little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart  pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care. The  child was pale and wan, but "]]]
