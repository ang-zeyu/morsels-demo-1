Please be quick!\" as  suddenly vanished.    Of course both the masters, making sure Miss Henniker must be in a fit,  or else that the house must be on fire, rushed upstairs, gallantly side  by side, to the rescue.  Rathbone and I, who were in hiding behind the  door next to that of the parlour, could hear them scuttling towards us  along the passage, and making straight for their trap.  They rushed  wildly into the room.  In a moment we were out after them, the door was  slammed to, the key was turned, and the first screw was well on its way  home before they even found out that the beloved Henniker was not there!    Then, after a moment's pause (during which screw number two had started  on its way), the handle of the door was shaken, and Mr Hashford's voice  cried out, \"Who is there?  What are you doing there, you boys?\"    His only answer was a mighty cheer from the assembled pupils of  Stonebridge House, which must have been quite as explicit as the longest  explanation.    \"Now then,\" cried Smith, as once more the handle of the door was  violently agitated; \"look sharp, you fellows, with the desks--\"    \"Smith,\" cried the voice of Mr Ladislaw, from within; \"you shall answer  for this, Smith.  Undo the door at once, sir.\"    But it had been agreed no parley should be held with the besieged, and  Smith's only answer was to help to drag up the first desk and plant it  firmly against the door.  The blockade was soon made, but until it was,  the fellows kept steadily and seriously to work.    Then ensued a scene I shall never forget, and which told significantly  as the most thrilling story what had been our privations and  persecutions and unhappiness at Stonebridge House.    The fellows yelled and rushed through the school as if they were mad.  They shouted, and sung, and halloed, and laughed.  They flung books and  rulers and ink-pots to the four winds of heaven.  They put the cane in  the fire, and one of the Henniker's reading books, which was lying in  the study, they tore into a thousand pieces.  They burst into every  forbidden nook and cranny of the house.  They rushed down to the kitchen  and up to the attics.  They bawled down the speaking-tube, and danced on  the dining-room table.  Nothing was omitted which could testify to their  glee at the new emancipation, or their hatred of the old _regime_.  They  held a mock school outside the Henniker's door, and gave one another bad  marks and canings with infinite laughter, by way of cheering up their  prisoner.    Finally the calls of hunger put an end to this strange demonstration,  and with a mighty stampede we made for the kitchen.  To our surprise, it  was empty.    \"Why, where's the cook and housemaid?\" cried one and another to Smith.    \"Oh,\" said Smith, who with the cares of generalship upon him had taken  only a small part in the jubilation which had just been celebrated, \"the  servants have gone home.  They both live at Felwick, so I said they  might take a week's holiday.\"    The coolness of this announcement was received with much laughter, in  the midst of which, however, Hawkesbury was heard to say, \"I hope Smith  is a good cook, for really I can't eat my food raw.\"    This was certainly a matter we had not reckoned on, and the idea of raw  meat did cast a temporary shadow on our happiness.  But Smith replied,  \"Oh, of course we do the cooking by turns.  By the way, Hawkesbury, you  and Flanagan have to see to that to-day.\"    Hawkesbury's smile left him for an instant.    \"Nonsense; I'm not going to do anything of the sort.\"    \"Then you'd better be the captain,\" said Smith glumly, \"if you aren't  going to obey orders.\"    Hawkesbury's smile returned.    \"Oh, if it's the captain's orders, of course.  Come along, Flanagan.\"    \"Come along,\" said the jovial Flanagan; \"I think we'll make a hash of it  with a vengeance!\"    Whereat this little breeze blew over.  As a matter of fact, we all  assisted at the cooking of this celebrated meal, and made a terrific  hash of it, which, nevertheless, we relished greatly, and declared we  had never tasted such a dinner since we came to Stonebridge House.  No  more we had!    But amid our own feasting it would never do to forget our prisoners.  Three parcels were made, containing each a liberal helping of bread and  meat, with little parcels of salt and butter thoughtfully added.    \"Write on them `For two days,'\" said Smith, \"and bring them up.\"    \"How about water?\" asked some one.    \"There's enough in each room for a day or two,\" said Smith, who seemed  to have taken note of everything.    \"I don't see the fun of feeding them up this way,\" said Rathbone.  \"You'll never get them to give in as long as you make them so jolly  comfortable.\"    \"I'd like to see how you liked it for two days,\" said Smith.  \"I don't  suppose you'd think yourself overfed or jolly comfortable either.  But  come on; have you got the string?\"    Each parcel was attached to a long piece of string, and conveyed in  state by the entire school to its respective destination.  The Henniker  was first fed.  Amid shouts of \"Cheer, boys, cheer,\" and \"Rule  Britannia,\" we marched up to her door and halted, while Smith, with the  aid of a rake, lifted the parcel on to the small ventilator above the  door, and gave it a little shove over the other side.    \"Now lower away,\" said he to the boy who held the string.    \"Smith, I hear your voice,\" cried the Henniker.  \"Smith, open my door,  _please_.\"    Except for the last extraordinary expression the Henniker's voice  sounded much as usual.  No answer, of course, was given, and we waited  until the parcel should be detached from the string.    For about five minutes it remained untouched, during which period the  holder tried to attract the attention of the prisoner by sundry  spasmodic jerkings of the string.  At length the fish did bite.  Without  a word the parcel was detached from the string.  We turned to go.    \"Plate, knife, and fork in the cupboard,\" cried out Smith, as we did so.    \"You don't mean to say,\" said Rathbone, as we went along, \"that you've  put a knife and fork for her?\"    \"Yes, I have,\" said Smith, in a manner which did not encourage the  truculent Rathbone to pursue the subject.    The feeding of the two masters was a longer process.  For to reach their  door it was necessary to climb over a perfect jungle of desks and chairs  piled up against it; and when reached it was discovered that the glass  ventilator, which usually stood open, had been shut and fastened inside.  But Smith was not to be baulked by a trifle.  He coolly broke the glass  with his rake, till he had made a hole big enough to admit the parcels,  which, one after the other, were lifted over the opening, and lowered  within reach of their respective owners.  In the present case the string  to which they were attached was double, so, when it was found that  neither was taken, Smith gave the order to \"run\" the string, and let  them drop the parcels off on to the floor.  This was done, and we were  turning to go, when Mr Ladislaw's voice rose in angry tones.    \"Listen to me, boys,\" he cried, authoritatively.    A general yell was the only answer to this, mingled with loud laughter,  as Mr Hashford's head suddenly appeared at the broken ventilator.  The  apparition was the signal for a general fusillade of paper balls, in the  midst of which the usher modestly retired from observation.    The evening was spent in the same rollicking manner as the afternoon.  We held mock school in Mr Ladislaw's study, and got Flanagan to dress  up in an old gown of the Henniker's, which was found in the boot-room,  and enact that favourite character's part, which he did to the life.  We  also made out our own \"reports\" for home, and played a most spirited  game of croquet in the hall, with potatoes for balls and brooms for  mallets, besides treating our prisoners to a ravishing concert by an  orchestra of one dinner-bell, two dish-covers, two combs and paper, and  one iron tray.    We kept it up till rather late, and, indeed, it was not till Smith  summoned us to a council of war that the problem of how and where to  spend the night occurred to us.    \"Some of us ought to stay up as sentinels,\" said our captain.    \"Well, I can't, for one,\" said Philpot, \"for I was never so sleepy in my  life.\"    \"I should think,\" said Hawkesbury, sweetly, \"if the captain stayed up we  should be quite safe.\"    Why _should_ Smith glare so whenever Hawkesbury spoke?  I wondered.  I'm  sure there did not seem to be anything offensive in this.    \"I'll stay up, Jack,\" said I, more with a desire to avert a row than  because I felt particularly \"spry.\"    \"So will I,\" said Shankley, \"if you'll dig me in the ribs when I get  sleepy.\"    \"I'll tell you what,\" said Smith, after having recovered himself.  \"Suppose we bring all the beds down and camp out on the landing.\"    This was carried with acclamation, and every one forthwith proceeded to  his dormitory, and reappeared staggering under the weight of his  bedclothes.  One monstrous bed was made in which we all \"camped out\" in  turn, one fellow only remaining awake as sentinel for an hour at a time.    \"We shall have to settle to-morrow,\" said Smith, when he had returned to  \"camp,\" after having gone the round and seen that all lights were out,  and all doors and bolts fastened--\"we shall have to settle to-morrow  what to say to them about coming out, you fellows.\"    \"I thought that was left to the captain,\" said Hawkesbury.    \"I vote we stick out against the Henniker having anything to do with  us,\" said Philpot, \"in or out of school.\"    \"Yes, and do away with afternoon school and preparation too,\" said  Rathbone; \"they are both nuisances.\"    \"And get a holiday to go out of bounds once a week,\" said Flanagan in  the act of dropping asleep.    These sweeping schemes of reform, however, agreeable as they sounded,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#13)"],[1,"which Grosvenor insisted upon doing being the payment to Dick of six  months' salary in advance, from the date of their landing upon South  African soil.  Practically the whole of this Dick was able to remit home  to his mother, since Grosvenor would not hear of his contributing so  much as a single penny toward the expenses of the expedition, therefore  the junior member of the partnership had no need to spend anything,  except for a few curios which he thought his mother might like to  display to her friends; but he laid in a few additional drugs, and also  added a spare instrument or two to his surgical case, to cover the  possibility of loss or accident.    Three days later they started for Johannesburg, by way of Delagoa Bay  and Pretoria, Grosvenor being very anxious to get a glimpse of life on  the Rand and to gain some knowledge of diamonds and diamond mining  before he finally bade farewell to civilisation.  Since Johannesburg lay  on the direct line of their route, and the knowledge sought might  possibly prove useful in the future, Dick raised no objection to the  proposal, especially as they went armed with letters of introduction  from Mitchell to some of the most influential of the Rand magnates and  others whose advice and assistance would be exceedingly helpful.  A busy  three weeks spent in the city and at Witwatersrand enriched them with  much very valuable information, both particular and general, and also  enabled them to acquire four excellent horses and an Indian coolie groom  named Ramoo Samee, who not only bore a most admirable character, but  also raised no objection when informed of the nature and scope of the  adventure upon which his employers were bound.  Here, too, and also at  Pretoria, the partners endeavoured to secure the services of a hunter as  guide and general superintendent, but were unable to meet with one who  conformed in all respects to their requirements; they therefore  ultimately decided to defer their further quest until their arrival in  Bulawayo, which was to be the point from which they would finally bid  farewell to civilisation.    But upon their arrival at Bulawayo, although they met with no difficulty  in providing themselves with a brand-new wagon and a team of twenty  \"salted\" oxen, together with a Hottentot driver named Jantje, and a  Kafir boy named 'Nkuku as voorlouper, no suitable candidate for the post  of guide offered himself or could be found; and finally, after devoting  a full week to fruitless search and enquiry, Dick and Grosvenor agreed  to start without one, and trust to luck and their own good sense.  Everybody, with one solitary exception, declared that it was a most  risky thing to do; but the solitary exception, in the shape of an old  Boer farmer named Van Zyl, applauded their pluck, and declared that they  were far more likely to succeed by learning the lesson of the wild for  themselves, and depending upon their own courage and adaptiveness, than  if they set out under the guidance of another, and remained more or less  in leading strings throughout the journey.    \"What I would advise,\" he said, \"is that you should look out for a good  `nigger'; he will be far more helpful to you than any white man, and  will be content to be a good servant to you--if you are careful to keep  him in his proper place--instead of trying to be your master.\"    This sounded like good, sensible advice, coming as it did from a man who  had been born, brought up, and had spent a long life on the borderline  separating civilisation from savagedom, and it finally confirmed them in  the determination, to which they had already practically come, to do  without a white guide.    According to Mitchell, their route from Bulawayo lay generally in a  north-easterly direction, and accordingly, after transacting all their  business, making every possible preparation for the long journey before  them, and writing their final letters home, announcing the fact that  they were about to plunge into the wilderness, and that, therefore, no  further news must be expected of them for an indefinite period, they set  out about ten o'clock on a certain glorious morning, boldly striking  straight out across the veldt, and directing their course by compass.  Their wagon was already fully loaded, the load consisting of several  air-tight cases of ammunition, six barrels of flour, a cask of sugar, a  bag of coffee, a chest of tea, a small keg of brandy--to be used only in  cases of the utmost emergency--a case containing pickles, condiments,  preserves, salt, and other articles of a similar character, to be  regarded as luxuries and used accordingly; their own personal belongings  including clothes and firearms, a small tent made of waterproof material  for sleeping in, two net hammocks with portable supports, a full set of  cooking utensils, four sacks of mealie meal, and, finally, two large  boxes of beads of various kinds, a quantity of brass wire, and a case of  cheap mechanical and other toys, small mirrors, etcetera which Grosvenor  had had the foresight to bring out from England with him, the last three  items being destined to be employed in bartering with the natives.  All  this constituted quite as heavy a load as it was at all desirable to put  upon the wagon, although the full team of twenty oxen made light of it,  especially as it was now the dry season, and the ground was firm and  hard for travelling.  As for Dick and Grosvenor, they travelled on  horseback, changing their steeds at every outspan, in order to accustom  the animals to them, and gradually to get them into good, hard condition  by working them to a certain extent every day.  They rode armed each  with a good, serviceable sporting rifle, capable of dealing with  practically any game except elephant, a formidable hunting knife, and a  revolver; and, in addition, each of them carried a pair of the finest  and most powerful binocular glasses that Grosvenor had been able to  procure in London.  He had had the foresight to provide two pairs in  case of accident, which was fortunate, for now each rider was  independent of the other.  Acting upon the advice of their friend Van  Zyl, they confined themselves strictly to short treks, averaging about  five miles each, and three treks per day, for the first four days, in  order to keep the oxen in good condition as long as possible.    Those first four days of their march were quite uneventful, the going  was good, the grass still rich and abundant, water plentiful, and there  was just enough game to keep the party well supplied with meat, while  the animals worked well and improved in condition rather than otherwise,  especially the horses, which proved to be even more promising than their  owners had hoped for when they purchased them.    It was on the morning of the fifth day that the party encountered what  might be spoken of as their first exciting incident, and it occurred, or  rather began, as they were nearing the end of their first trek, about  nine o'clock in the morning.  Dick and Grosvenor, mounted as usual, with  the half-dozen dogs that constituted their pack quartering the ground  ahead of them, were nearly a mile ahead of the wagon, looking out for a  suitable spot for the first outspan, when a sudden clamour on the part  of the dogs, who had just disappeared over a low rise in the ground,  caused the two riders to put spurs to their horses, in order to see what  was the cause of the outcry.  A short gallop sufficed to carry them to  the crest of the ridge, when they beheld the dogs baying and snarling  round a fine, well-set-up native \"boy\", who, armed with assagais and  knobkerrie, constituted one of a party of some thirty in number who  appeared to be guarding a herd of about three hundred grazing cattle,  while about half a mile farther on was a native village of some fifty  Kafir huts of the usual beehived shape, built in the midst of a number  of mealie fields occupying an area of, roughly, about half a square  mile, situated near the banks of a small stream.    Dick Maitland, who had early developed a rather remarkable aptitude for  picking up the language of the natives, at once cantered forward, and,  calling off the dogs, demanded to know the name of the village, and  where would be the best place at which to outspan.  But the native whom  he addressed, and who seemed to be labouring under considerable  excitement, replied with such a rapid flow of words that his speech was  utterly unintelligible, save that his communication had something to do  with lions, the boy pointing first to a big clump of bush about a mile  distant, and then to the village itself.  Dick made several attempts to  arrive at a better understanding of the nature of the communication, but  without any very marked success, and at length suggested that Grosvenor  should ride back to the wagon and hurry it forward, in order that  Jantje, the Hottentot driver, might act as interpreter.  This was done,  and about twenty minutes later the wagon arrived, and the situation was  explained to Jantje, who forthwith poured out a flood of eloquence upon  the little band of natives, who by this time had gathered round Dick and  were earnestly endeavouring to make him understand something that they  evidently regarded as of very great importance.  A brief but animated  conversation at once ensued, at the end of which Jantje turned to his  employers and explained:    \"Dhese people say, sars, dat dhere is four, five lion in de bush yander  and dhey won' go 'way, and dhey wan' to know if white gent'men be so  kind as to kill dhem lion; because if dhey not be killed dhey kill de  poor Kafirs' cattle.  Two day ago dhem lion kill two oxen and mos'  horrible maul de boy dat was herding dhem.\"    \"Phew! lions, eh?\" exclaimed Grosvenor.  \"I say, Maitland, this is good  news, eh, what?  I am longing for the chance to have a pot at a lion.  All right, Jantje; you tell them that we will"]]]
