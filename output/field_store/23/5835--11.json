[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#13)"],[1," of Coromandel call the tree from which it is  principally obtained Gokathu, which grows also in Ceylon and Siam. From  the wounded leaves and young shoots the gamboge is collected in a liquid  state and dried. Our indigenous herb Celandine yields abundantly, in the  same manner, a beautiful yellow juice of the same properties as gamboge.  Gamboge is of a gum-resinous nature and clear yellow colour. It is  bright and transparent, but not of great depth, and in its deepest  touches shines too much and verges upon brown. When properly used, it is  more durable than generally reputed, both in water and oil; and  conduces, when mixed with other colours, to their stability and keeping  their place, on account of its gum and resin. It is deepened in some  degree by ammoniacal and impure air, and somewhat weakened, but not  easily discoloured, by the action of light. Time effects less change on  this colour than on other bright vegetal yellows; but white lead and  other metalline pigments injure, while terrene and alkaline substances  redden it. In water it works remarkably well, and forms an opaque  emulsion without grinding or preparation, by means of its natural gum;  but is with difficulty employed in oil, &c., in a dry condition. It  dries well, however, in its natural state, and lasts in glazing when  deprived of its gum. With regard to other colours it is perfectly  innocent, and though a strong medicine, is not dangerous or deleterious  in use. Gamboge has been employed as a yellow lake, precipitated upon an  aluminous base; but a better way of preparing it is to form a paste of  the colour in water, and mix it with lemon yellow, with which pigment  being diffused it goes readily into oil or varnish. Glazed over other  colours in water, its resin acts as a varnish which protects them; and  under other colours its gum acts as a preparation which admits  varnishing. It is injured by a less degree of heat than most pigments.    In landscape, gamboge affords with indigo or Antwerp blue clear bright  greens, and with sepia a very useful sober tint. For sunrise and sunset  clouds, a mixture of gamboge and cadmium yellow will be found useful.    32. EXTRACT OF GAMBOGE    Is the colouring matter separated from its greenish gum and impurities  by solution in alcohol, filtration and precipitation, by which it  acquires a powdery texture, rendering it miscible in oil, &c., and  capable of being employed in glazing. At the same time it is improved in  colour, and retains its original property of working well in water with  gum. Gamboge is likewise soluble in caustic potash, forming a red  liquid, from which it is thrown down by acids.    33. INDIAN YELLOW    Is a pigment long employed in India under the name _Purree_, but has not  many years been introduced generally into painting in Europe. It is  imported in the form of balls of a fetid odour, and is produced from the  urine of the camel. It appears to be a urio-phosphate of lime, and is of  a beautiful pure yellow colour and light powdery texture; of greater  body and depth than gamboge, but inferior in these respects to  gallstone. Indian yellow resists the sun's rays with singular power in  water painting; yet in ordinary light and air, or even in a book, the  beauty of its colour is not lasting. In oil it is exceedingly fugitive,  both alone and in tint. Owing probably to its alkaline nature, it has an  injurious effect upon cochineal lakes and carmine when used with them.  The colour is not damaged by foul air, and, as lime does not destroy it,  the pigment may be employed in fresco according to its powers.    Indian yellow washes and works extremely well, and is adapted for  draperies and for compounding landscape greens--where permanency is not  required. Blackness in the darkest shadows of the foliage will sometimes  result from too great a use of indigo; should this evil exist, no colour  is so fitted to regain the proper tone as Indian yellow employed  thickly.      LAKES.    There are several pigments of this denomination, varying in colour and  appearance according to the substances used and modes of preparation.  Usually they are in the form of drops, and their colours are in general  bright yellow, very transparent, and not liable to change in an impure  atmosphere--qualities which would render them very valuable, were they  not soon discoloured and even destroyed on exposure to air and light,  both in water and oil. In the latter vehicle, they are bad driers, like  most lakes, and they do not stand the action of white lead and other  metallic pigments. If used, therefore, it should be as simple as  possible. Of these lakes, the following are the best; but it must be  borne in mind that, as not one of them is permanent, the compounds they  afford are of necessity unstable.    34. YELLOW LAKE    Is a bright transparent yellow, a difficult drier, and liable to be  destroyed by light. It affords beautiful foliage tints, and would, if it  could be depended on, be of extreme value in what is called \"glazing.\"    35. ITALIAN PINK,    Also called _English_ and _Dutch Pink_, is an absurd name for a stronger  and richer kind of yellow lake, warmer in tint and more powerful than  the preceding. It is a rich transparent yellow, yielding a variety of  fine foliage tints by admixture with indigo and sepia in different  proportions. These three colours with burnt sienna will produce almost  every variety of sunny foliage. It gives likewise good olive greens with  lamp black.    36. QUERCITRON LAKE,    Or _Quercitron Yellow_, is what its name implies. It is dark in  substance, in grains of a glossy fracture, perfectly transparent, and  when ground is of a beautiful yellow colour. In painting it follows, and  adds richness and depth to, gamboge in water, and goes well into  varnish; but any lead used in rendering oils siccative, browns it, and  for the same reason it is useless in tints.    37. LEMON YELLOW,    Or chromate of baryta, is exceedingly difficult to make well. Upon the  mode of manufacture depend not only the beauty of the colour but its  stability. If properly and carefully prepared, it is of a vivid lemon  tint, deep or pale, very clear, very pure and permanent. It also washes  well, and is entirely free from the slightest tinge of orange. This may  be pronounced the only chromate which possesses durability, not being  liable to change by damp or foul air, by the action of light or the  steel palette-knife, or by mixture with white lead and other pigments,  either in water or oil, in both of which it works pleasantly. Lemon  yellow is chiefly adapted to points of high light, and has a peculiarly  happy effect when glazed over greens in both modes of painting. In water  it exceeds gamboge in brightness, and compounded therewith improves its  beauty. This mixture also goes readily into oil; indeed it is the best  and easiest way of rendering gamboge diffusible as an oil colour--simple  emulsion of the gamboge in a little water, and trituration of the lemon  yellow therewith, being all that is requisite for the purpose.    Lemon yellow has not much power, and is semi-opaque. In distance, its  light wash is used with great effect for cool sunny greens, for which a  minute quantity of emerald green may be added to it. Being uninjured by  lime, the colour is eligible in fresco and crayons.    38. MARS YELLOW,    _Jaune de Mars_, _Jaune de Fer_, _Iron Yellow_, &c., is an artificially  prepared iron ochre, of the nature of sienna earth. In its general  qualities it resembles the ochres, with the same eligibilities and  exceptions, but is more transparent, as well as purer, clearer, richer,  and brighter. Like them it is quite permanent. The colours of iron exist  in endless variety in nature, and are capable of the same variation by  art, from sienna yellow, through orange and red, to a species of purple,  brown, and black, among which are useful and valuable distinctions. They  were formerly introduced by the author, and have been received under the  names of Mars yellow, Mars orange, Mars red, Mars violet, and Mars  brown. All of them are brighter and purer than native ochres, and  equally stable. When carefully prepared, these pigments dry well in  proportion to their depth, are marked by a subdued richness rather than  brilliancy, and have the general habits of sienna earths and ochres.  Their faint washes possess the desirable quality of transparent  clearness.    We have occasionally found Mars yellow mixed with orpiment, or chromate  of lead, for the purpose of brightening the colour.    39. NAPLES YELLOW    Was a compound of lead and antimony, anciently prepared at Naples under  the name of _Giallolino_, and was variously of a pleasing light, warm  yellow tint. It was opaque and of good body, not altered by the light of  the sun, and might be used with comparative safety in oil or varnish,  under the same management as the whites of lead. Like these, however, it  was liable to change even to blackness by damp and impure air when  employed in water. Iron was also destructive of the colour of this  yellow, on which account great care was requisite, in grinding and using  it, not to touch it with the common steel palette knife, but to compound  its tints with a spatula of ivory or horn. For the same reason, it was  apt to suffer in composition with ochres, Prussian and Antwerp blues,  and other pigments of which iron was a principal or ingredient. Used  pure or with white lead it was eligible in oil, in which it worked and  dried well. It was also employed in enamel painting as it vitrified  without change. In this state it was called _Giallolino di fornace_, and  was introduced as a pigment for artists, under the erroneous conception  that vitrification gives permanence to colours, when in truth it only  increases the difficulty of levigation, and injures their texture for  working. We have spoken of Naples yellow in the past tense, because the  pigment now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#13)"],[1,"rying-pan  with her rod, and retired into the wall. The grand vizier being witness  to what had passed, \"This is too wonderful and extraordinary,\" said he,  \"to be concealed from the sultan; I will inform him of this prodigy.\"    The sultan, being much surprised, sent immediately for the fisherman,  and said to him: \"Friend, cannot you bring me four more such fish?\" The  fisherman replied: \"If your majesty will be pleased to allow me three  days, I will do it.\" Having obtained his time, he went to the lake  immediately, and at the first throwing in of his net he caught four  fish, and brought them directly to the sultan, who was so much the more  rejoiced, as he did not expect them so soon, and ordered him four  hundred pieces of gold. As soon as the sultan had the fish, he ordered  them to be carried into his closet, with all that was necessary for  frying them; and having shut himself up with the vizier, the minister  cleaned them, put them into the pan, and when they were fried on one  side, turned them upon the other; then the wall of the closet opened,  but instead of the young lady, there came out a black, in the habit of a  slave, and of a gigantic stature, with a great green staff in his hand.  He advanced toward the pan, and touching one of the fish with his staff,  said, with a terrible voice: \"Fish, are you in your duty?\" At these  words the fish raised up their heads, and answered: \"Yes, yes; we are;  if you reckon, we reckon; if you pay your debts, we pay ours; if you  fly, we overcome and are content.\"    The fish had no sooner finished these words, than the black threw the  pan into the middle of the closet, and reduced them to a coal. Having  done this, he retired fiercely, and entering again into the aperture, it  closed, and the wall appeared just as it did before.    \"After what I have seen,\" said the sultan to the vizier, \"it will not be  possible for me to be easy; these fish, without doubt, signify something  extraordinary.\" He sent for the fisherman, and when he came, said to  him: \"Fisherman, the fish you have brought us make me very uneasy; where  did you catch them?\" \"Sir,\" answered he, \"I fished for them in a lake  situated betwixt four hills, beyond the mountain that we see from  hence.\" \"Know'st thou not that lake?\" said the sultan to the vizier.  \"No,\" replied the vizier, \"I never so much as heard of it, although I  have for sixty years hunted beyond that mountain.\" The sultan asked the  fisherman how far the lake might be from the palace. The fisherman  answered it was not above three hours' journey; upon this assurance the  sultan commanded all his court to take horse, and the fisherman served  them for a guide. They all ascended the mountain, and at the foot of it  they saw, to their great surprise, a vast plain that nobody had observed  till then, and at last they came to the lake, which they found to be  situated betwixt four hills, as the fisherman had described. The water  was so transparent that they observed all the fish to be like those  which the fisherman had brought to the palace.    The sultan stood upon the bank of the lake, and after beholding the fish  with admiration, demanded of his courtiers if it were possible they had  never seen this lake which was within so short a distance of the town.  They all answered that they had never so much as heard of it.    \"Since you all agree that you never heard of it,\" said the sultan, \"and  as I am no less astonished than you are at this novelty, I am resolved  not to return to my palace till I learn how this lake came here, and why  all the fish in it are of four colours.\" Having spoken thus, he ordered  his court to encamp; and immediately his pavilion and the tents of his  household were planted upon the banks of the lake.    When night came the sultan retired under his pavilion, and spoke to the  grand vizier thus: \"Vizier, my mind is uneasy; this lake transported  hither, the black that appeared to us in my closet, and the fish that we  heard speak; all these things so much excite my curiosity that I cannot  resist my impatient desire to have it satisfied. To this end I am  resolved to withdraw alone from the camp, and I order you to keep my  absence secret: stay in my pavilion, and to-morrow morning, when the  emirs and courtiers come to attend my levee, send them away and tell  them that I am somewhat indisposed and wish to be alone; and the  following days tell them the same thing, till I return.\"    The grand vizier endeavoured to divert the sultan from this design; he  represented to him the danger to which he might be exposed, and that all  his labour might perhaps be in vain; but it was to no purpose; the  sultan was resolved. He put on a suit fit for walking and took his  cimeter; and as soon as he found that all was quiet in the camp, went  out alone, and passed over one of the hills without much difficulty; he  found the descent still more easy, and when he came to the plain, walked  on till the sun arose, and then he saw before him, at a considerable  distance, a vast building. He rejoiced at the sight, in hopes of  receiving there the information he sought. When he drew near, he found  it was a magnificent palace, or rather a strong castle, of black  polished marble, and covered with fine steel, as smooth as glass. Being  highly pleased that he had so speedily met with something worthy his  curiosity, he stopped before the front of the castle, and considered it  with attention.    He then advanced toward the gate, which had two leaves, one of them  open; though he might immediately have entered, yet he thought it best  to knock. This he did at first softly, and waited for some time; but  seeing no one, and supposing he had not been heard, he knocked harder  the second time, and after that he knocked again and again, but no one  yet appearing, he was exceedingly surprised; for he could not think  that a castle in such repair was without inhabitants. \"If there be no  one in it,\" said he to himself, \"I have nothing to fear; and if it be  inhabited, I have wherewith to defend myself.\"    At last he entered, and when he came within the porch, he cried: \"Is  there no one here to receive a stranger who comes in for some  refreshment as he passes by?\" He repeated the same words two or three  times; but though he spoke very loud, he was not answered. The silence  increased his astonishment: he came into a spacious court, and looked on  every side for inhabitants, but discovered none.    Perceiving nobody in the court, he entered the grand halls, which were  hung with silk tapestry, the alcoves and sofas covered with stuffs of  Mecca, and the porches with the richest stuffs of India. He came  afterward into a superb saloon, in the middle of which was a fountain,  with a lion of massy gold at each angle: water issued from the mouths of  the four lions, and as it fell, formed diamonds and pearls resembling a  jet d'eau, which, springing from the middle of the fountain, rose nearly  to the top of a cupola painted in Arabesque.    The castle, on three sides, was encompassed by a garden, with parterres  of flowers and shrubbery; and to complete the beauty of the place, an  infinite number of birds filled the air with their harmonious notes, and  always remained there, nets being spread over the garden, and fastened  to the palace to confine them. The sultan walked from apartment to  apartment, where he found everything rich and magnificent. Being tired  with walking, he sat down in a veranda, which had a view over the  garden, reflecting upon what he had seen, when suddenly he heard the  voice of one complaining, in lamentable tones. He listened with  attention, and heard distinctly these words: \"O fortune! thou who  wouldst not suffer me longer to enjoy a happy lot, forbear to persecute  me, and by a speedy death put an end to my sorrows. Alas! is it possible  that I am still alive, after so many torments as I have suffered!\"    The sultan rose up, advanced toward the place whence he heard the voice,  and coming to the door of a great hall, opened it, and saw a handsome  young man, richly habited, seated upon a throne raised a little above  the ground. Melancholy was painted on his countenance. The sultan drew  near and saluted him; the young man returned his salutation, by an  inclination of his head, not being able to rise, at the same time  saying: \"My lord, I should rise to receive you, but am hindered by sad  necessity, and therefore hope you will not be offended.\" \"My lord,\"  replied the sultan, \"I am much obliged to you for having so good an  opinion of me: as to the reason of your not rising, whatever your  apology be, I heartily accept it. Being drawn hither by your complaints,  and afflicted by your grief, I come to offer you my help. I flatter  myself that you will relate to me the history of your misfortunes; but  inform me first of the meaning of the lake near the palace, where the  fish are of four colours; whose castle is this; how you came to be here;  and why you are alone.\"    Instead of answering these questions, the young man began to weep  bitterly. \"How inconstant is fortune!\" cried he; \"she takes pleasure to  pull down those she has raised. Where are they who enjoy quietly the  happiness which they hold of her, and whose day is always clear and  serene?\"    The sultan, moved with compassion to see him in such a condition, prayed  him to relate the cause of his excessive grief. \"Alas! my lord,\" replied  the young man, \"how is it possible but I should grieve, and my eyes be  inexhaustible fountains of tears?\" At these words, lifting up his robe,  he showed the sultan that he was a man only from the head to the girdle,  and that the other half of his body was black marble.    The sultan was much surprised when he saw the deplorable condition of  the young man. \"That which you show me,\" said he, \"while it fills me  with horror, excites my curiosity, so that I am impatient to hear your  history, which, "]]]
