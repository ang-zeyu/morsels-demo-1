Three of the herdsmen followed them as far as they were able, but soon  became exhausted and lost on the prairie. One of them found his way  back to camp in a state of great prostration and suffering. One of the  others was found dead, and the third crawling about upon his hands and  knees, after the storm ceased.    It happened, fortunately, that I had reserved a quantity of corn to be  used in the event of finding a scarcity of grass, and as soon as the  ground became covered with snow, so that the animals could not get at  the grass, I fed out the corn, which I am induced to believe saved  their lives. Indeed, they did not seem to be at all affected by this  prolonged and unseasonable tempest. This occurred upon the summit of  the elevated ridge dividing the waters of the Arkansas and South Platte  Rivers, where storms are said to be of frequent occurrence.    The greater part of the animals that stampeded were recovered after the  storm, and, although they had traveled a hundred miles at a very rapid  pace, they did not seem to be much affected by it.

With a train of pack animals properly organized and equipped, a party  may travel with much comfort and celerity. It is enabled to take short  cuts, and move over the country in almost any direction without regard  to roads. Mountains and broken ground may easily be traversed, and  exemption is gained from many of the troubles and detentions attendant  upon the transit of cumbersome wagon-trains.    One of the most essential requisites to the outfit of a pack train is a  good pack-saddle. Various patterns are in use, many of which are mere  instruments of torture upon the backs of the poor brutes, lacerating  them cruelly, and causing continued pain.    The Mexicans use a leathern pack-saddle without a tree. It is stuffed  with hay, and is very large, covering almost the entire back, and  extending far down the sides. It is secured with a broad hair girth,  and the load is kept in position by a lash-rope drawn by two men so  tight as to give the unfortunate beast intense suffering.    [Illustration: GRIMSLEY'S PACK-SADDLE.]    A pack-saddle is made by T. Grimsley, No. 41 Main Street, St. Louis,  Mo. It is open at the top, with a light, compact, and strong tree,  which fits the animal's back well, and is covered with raw hide, put on  green, and drawn tight by the contraction in drying. It has a leathern  breast-strap, breeching, and lash-strap, with a broad hair girth  fastened in the Mexican fashion. Of sixty-five of these saddles that I  used in crossing the Rocky Mountains, over an exceedingly rough and  broken section, not one of them wounded a mule's back, and I regard  them as the best saddles I have ever seen.    No people, probably, are more familiar with the art of packing than the  Mexicans. They understand the habits, disposition, and powers of the  mule perfectly, and will get more work out of him than any other men I  have ever seen. The mule and the donkey are to them as the camel to the  Arab--their porters over deserts and mountains where no other means of  transportation can be used to advantage. The Spanish Mexicans are,  however, cruel masters, having no mercy upon their beasts, and it is no  uncommon thing for them to load their mules with the enormous burden of  three or four hundred pounds.    These muleteers believe that, when the pack is firmly lashed, the  animal supports his burden better and travels with greater ease, which  seems quite probable, as the tension forms, as it were, an external  sheath supporting and bracing the muscles. It also has a tendency to  prevent the saddle from slipping and chafing the mule's back. With such  huge _cargas_ as the Mexicans load upon their mules, it is impossible,  by any precautions, to prevent their backs and withers from becoming  horribly mangled, and it is common to see them working their animals  day after day in this miserable plight. This heavy packing causes the  scars that so often mark Mexican mules.    The animal, in starting out from camp in the morning, groaning under  the weight of his heavy burden, seems hardly able to move; but the pack  soon settles, and so loosens the lashing that after a short time he  moves along with more ease. Constant care and vigilance on the part of  the muleteers are necessary to prevent the packs from working loose and  falling off. The adjustment of a _carga_ upon a mule does not, however,  detain the caravan, as the others move on while it is being righted. If  the mules are suffered to halt, they are apt to lie down, and it is  very difficult for them, with their loads, to rise; besides, they are  likely to strain themselves in their efforts to do so. The Mexicans, in  traveling with large caravans, usually make the day's march without  nooning, as too much time would be consumed in unloading and packing up  again.    Packs, when taken off in camp, should be piled in a row upon the  ground, and, if there be a prospect of rain, the saddles should be  placed over them, and the whole covered with the saddle-blankets or  canvas.    The muleteers and herders should be mounted upon well-trained horses,  and be careful to keep the animals of the caravan from wandering or  scattering along the road. This can easily be done by having some of  the men riding upon each side, and others in rear of the caravan.    In herding mules it is customary among prairie travelers to have a  bell-mare, to which the mules soon become so attached that they will  follow her wherever she goes. By keeping her in charge of one of the  herdsmen, the herds are easily controlled; and during a stampede, if  the herdsman mounts her, and rushes ahead toward camp, they will  generally follow.    In crossing rivers the bell-mare should pass first, after which the  mules are easily induced to take to the water and pass over, even if  they have to swim. Mules are good swimmers unless they happen, by  plunging off a high bank, to get water in their ears, when they are  often drowned. Whenever a mule in the water drops his ears, it is a  sure indication that he has water in them, and he should be taken out  as soon as possible. To prevent accidents of this nature, where the  water is deep and the banks abrupt, the mule herds should be allowed to  enter slowly, and without crowding, as otherwise they are not only  likely to get their heads under water, but to throw each other over and  get injured.    The _madrina_, or bell-mare, acts a most important part in a herd  of mules, and is regarded by experienced campaigners as indispensable  to their security. She is selected for her quiet and regular habits.  She will not wander far from the camp. If she happen to have a colt by  her side, this is no objection, as the mules soon form the most devoted  attachment to it. I have often seen them leave their grazing when very  hungry, and flock around a small colt, manifesting their delight by  rubbing it with their noses, licking it with their tongues, kicking up  their heels, and making a variety of other grotesque demonstrations of  affection, while the poor little colt, perfectly unconscious of the  cause of these ungainly caresses, stood trembling with fear, but unable  to make his escape from the compact circle of his mulish admirers.  Horses and asses are also used as bell animals, and the mules soon  become accustomed to following them. If a man leads or rides a bell  animal in advance, the mules follow, like so many dogs, in the most  orderly procession.    \"After traveling about fourteen miles,\" says Bayard Taylor, \"we were  joined by three miners, and our mules, taking a sudden liking for their  horses, jogged on at a more brisk pace. The instincts of the mulish  heart form an interesting study to the traveler in the mountains. I  would (were the comparison not too ungallant) liken it to a woman's,  for it is quite as uncertain in its sympathies, bestowing its  affections when least expected, and, when bestowed, quite as constant,  so long as the object is not taken away. Sometimes a horse, sometimes  an ass, captivates the fancy of a whole drove of mules, but often an  animal nowise akin. Lieutenant Beale told me that his whole train of  mules once galloped off suddenly, on the plains of the Cimarone, and  ran half a mile, when they halted in apparent satisfaction. The cause  of their freak was found to be a buffalo calf which had strayed from  the herd. They were frisking around it in the greatest delight, rubbing  their noses against it, throwing up their heels, and making themselves  ridiculous by abortive attempts to neigh and bray, while the calf,  unconscious of its attractive qualities, stood trembling in their  midst.\"    \"If several large troops,\" says Charles Darwin, \"are turned into one  field to graze in the morning, the muleteer has only to lead the  _madrinas_ a little apart and tinkle their bells, and, although there  may be 200 or 300 mules together, each immediately knows its own bell,  and separates itself from the rest. The affection of these animals for  their madrina saves infinite trouble. It is nearly impossible to lose  an old mule, for, if detained several hours by force, she will, by the  power of smell, like a dog, track out her companions, or rather the  madrina; for, according to the muleteer, she is the chief object of  affection. The feeling, however, is not of an individual nature, for I  believe I am right in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as  a madrina."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#13)"],[1,"Diaper may be dark blue, or sable, or  argent on the azure squares, and on the golden ones whatever the artist  might consider would be most effective; but the Diaper, in this and in  all other examples, must always be subordinate to the area and tincture  of the field. The finest known early example of heraldic Diaper in  enamel, is the Shield of WILLIAM DE VALENCE, Earl of PEMBROKE, in  Westminster Abbey, A.D. 1296. Very beautiful early examples of Diapering  have been preserved in relics of heraldic stained glass.      [Illustration: No. 68.--Shield of Arms of Earl de Warrenne,    Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk.]    DISPOSITION: BLAZONING.--By _Disposition_ is understood the placing and  arranging of charges. A single important charge, which has not a fixed  position of its own, is placed in the centre of any composition: and  minor charges are arranged in their most natural and consistent order  and positions, any deviation from which must be specified. A single  charge, many times repeated, and small in size, whether with or without  any special orderly disposition, is said to be _Semée_--strewn, that is,  or scattered over the field, as seed is sown by the hand; or, if the  charges are very small or very numerous, the term _poudrée_ or  _powdered_ has sometimes been used. The expression--\"_three, two, one_,\"  signifies that a charge is repeated six times, the Disposition being  three in a horizontal row towards the chief of the Shield, then two in a  similar row in the centre, and one in base. In the same manner, the  expressions--\"_four, four, one_,\" \"_four, three, two, one_,\" \"_three and  one_,\" &c., are used as occasion may require. For other dispositions of  charges other appropriate terms will present themselves to our notice,  growing out of our subject as it advances.    Should a _Tincture_ or a _Number_ occur a second time in blazoning a  single composition, it must be indicated, not by repeating the word  already used, but by reference to it. Thus, if the tincture of the field  should occur a second time, reference is made to it in the formula--\"_of  the field_:\" or, perhaps more frequently--\"_of the first_;\" or, if the  tincture that is named second in order in the blazoning be repeated, it  is indicated by the expression--\"_of the second_;\" and so on. Again:  should there be three fleurs de lys and also three crescents in one and  the same composition, having specified the \"three fleurs de lys,\" the  number of the crescents would be set forth in the words--\"_as many_  crescents:\" providing nothing else has in the wording of the blazon  intervened in such a way as to cause uncertainty by the use of the term;  and so, in like manner, with any other numbers of these or of any other  charges.    In descriptive Blazoning, Epithets, which follow their own Nouns,  precede the Tinctures that are associated with those nouns: thus,  a black rampant lion having golden claws is blazoned,--_a lion rampt.  sa., armed or_. In written and printed blazoning, the arrangement of the  words and the placing the stops are alike matters of supreme importance.  The sentences are to be short. A comma is to mark the end of each  complete minor clause or division of a sentence: a colon, each more  important clause. A point or period is to follow every abbreviated word,  to mark the fact of the abbreviation, but without affecting the  additional presence of a comma (as in the blazoning, \"_a lion rampant  sa._,\") or of a colon, as the case may be; but a second period is  unnecessary. It is a very common error to overload heraldic blazoning  with commas which, instead of aiding to simplify the sentences, obscure  the meaning and perplex the reader. It is always correct to  write--\"_three lion's heads_,\" \"_six pilgrim's staves_,\" &c.: and always  incorrect to write--\"_three lions' heads_,\" \"_six pilgrims' staves_,\"  &c.; but it is a point printers have an apparently invincible objection  to accept.    EMBLAZONING IN TINCTURES.--On this head I must be content to offer to  students only a few brief practical observations. The metal _Gold_ may  be rendered with gold prepared in small saucers, or (most  advantageously) in minute slabs; this preparation is applied, like a  common water-colour, by moistening the gold with water; and it is  desirable previously to have washed the paper, card (or vellum) with  diluted white of egg. Gold leaf may also be used, but the process is  tedious, and requires both skill and experience to ensure complete  success. Yellow paint, again, may be used to represent the metal, the  best colours being _cadmium yellow_, or \"_aureolin_\" (Winsor and Newton)  mixed with _Chinese white_. For shading, _carmine_, or _crimson lake_,  mixed with gum. For _Silver_, _aluminium_ may be used with excellent  effect; or _Chinese white_; or the paper may be left white: for shading,  _grey_ (_blue_ and _Indian ink_ mixed) and gum. The Aluminium is  prepared, like the gold, in minute slabs: it may be obtained, of great  excellence, from Messrs. Winsor & Newton, by whom also a very pure  preparation of gold is sold; but both the gold and the aluminium slabs  are sold by all good artists' colourmen. These Metals may be diapered,  as well as burnished, with an agate-burnisher.    For _Azure_:--_French blue_, freely mixed with _Chinese white_ and a  very little gum, the colour to be laid on thick: shade with _Prussian  blue_ mixed with a larger proportion of gum. For _Gules_:--_Orange  vermilion_ either pure, or mixed with a very little _cadmium yellow_ or  _Chinese white_, and still less gum: (never use a brilliant but most  treacherous preparation known as \"pure scarlet:\") shade with _carmine_  or _crimson lake_, and gum. For _Vert_:--_emerald green_, with _Chinese  white_ and a little gum: shade with dark green, made from mixing  _aureolin_ (or _gamboge_) with _Prussian blue_ and gum. For  _Purpure_:--mix _carmine_ and _French blue_, with a little gum: shade  with a darker tint of the same. For _Sable_:--Very dark _grey_, made by  mixing a little _Chinese white_ and gum with black: shade with black and  more gum.    When the Metals are rendered by gold and aluminium, it is desirable that  these tinctures should be applied, and that the diapering and burnishing  of the Metals should also be completed with the burnisher, before the  adjoining colours are laid on. The burnishing may be executed in two or  three hours after the Metals have been applied to the paper; and the  paper should be placed upon a piece of glass during the processes of  burnishing and diapering.          CHAPTER VI    THE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY    SECTION III      _The Ordinaries:-- The Chief; Fesse; Bar; Pale; Cross, its heraldic    varieties; Bend; Saltire; Chevron; and Pile._      \"Marks of Hereditary Honour, given or authorised by some supreme    Power.\"      --SCIENCE OF HERALDRY.      THE ORDINARIES.--The simple Charges of early Heraldry, which always have  been held in the highest esteem and which are most familiar, are:--The  _Chief_, the _Fesse_, the _Bar_, the _Pale_, the _Cross_, the _Bend_,  the _Saltire_, the _Chevron_, and the _Pile_. They may be considered to  have been derived from various means that were adopted to strengthen  Shields for use in combat, the _Cross_ always being in great favour from  having a definite symbolism of its own. These Ordinaries may be formed  by any of the Border Lines, No. 38. Occasionally they are borne alone;  but more generally they are associated with other bearings, or they have  various figures and devices charged upon themselves. In some cases,  presently to be specified, more than one Ordinary may appear in a single  composition. The _Bar_, the _Pale_, the _Bend_, and the _Chevron_ have  _Diminutives_. The _Cross_ has many _Varieties_.    THE CHIEF (H. 3), bounded by a horizontal line, contains the uppermost  third (or, in practice, somewhat less than the third, of the field of a  Shield, as in No. 71. The Shield of LE BOTILER, No. 72, is--_Or, a chief  indented az._ (H. 3). A Chief may be borne with any other Ordinary  except the Fesse; it may also be charged with any other figures or  devices:--thus, for Sire BERNARD DE BRUS, No. 73,--_Az., a chief and a  saltire or_: for Sire JOHAN DE CLINTONE, No. 74,--_Arg., on a chief az.  two fleurs de lys or_: and for Sire JOHAN DE CLINTONE de Madestoke, No.  75,--_Arg., on a chief az. two mullets or_ (all E. 2). When any charge  is set in the uppermost third of a Shield, or when several charges are  disposed in a horizontal row across the uppermost part of a Shield, they  all are said to be \"_in Chief_.\"      [Illustration: No. 71.]      [Illustration: No. 72.--Le Botiler.]      [Illustration: No. 73.--De Brus.]      [Illustration: No. 74.]      [Illustration: No. 75.--De Clintone.]      [Illustration: No. 76.--De Clifford]      [Illustration: No. 77.--De Pateshulle.]      [Illustration: No. 78.--Le Vavasour.]    THE FESSE (H. 3), which crosses the centre of a Shield horizontally,  when charged occupies about one-third (or rather less than one-third) of  the field; but when without charges, it is usually drawn somewhat  narrower. The Shield of Lord CLIFFORD is,--_Chequée or and az., a fesse  gu._, No. 76. For ROBT. LE FITZ-WATER,--_Or, a fesse between two  chevrons gu._: for JOHN DE PATESHULLE, No. 77,--_Arg., a fesse sa.,  between three crescents gu._ (all H.3): for WILLIAM LE VAVASOUR, No.  78,--_Or, a fesse dancette sa._: for DE HEMENHALE, No. 79,--_Or, on a  fesse between two chevrons gu., three escallops arg._: and for DE  DAGEWORTHE, No. 80,--_Erm., a fesse gu. bezantée_ (all E. 2). When they  are disposed in a horizontal row across the centre of a Shield, Charges  are \"_in fesse_.\"      [Illustration: No. 79.--De Hemenhale.]      [Illustration: No. 80.--De Dageworthe.]      [Illustration: No. 81.--De Harecourt.]      [Illustration: No. 82.--Wake.]      [Illustration: No. 83.--De Huntercumbe.]      [Illustration: No. 84.--De la Mere.]    THE BAR (H.
