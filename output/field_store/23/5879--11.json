Consequently the  monks of St. Swithin at Winchester made a formal complaint to Henry  II. against their abbot for taking away three of the thirteen dishes  they used to have at dinner. The monks of Canterbury were still more  luxurious, for they had at least seventeen dishes every day besides a  dessert; and these dishes were dressed with spices and sauces which  excited the appetite as well as pleased the taste. And of course the  festive season of Christmas was an occasion of special indulgence.  Sometimes serious excesses were followed by severe discipline,  administered after the manner shown in the ancient illustration which  is reproduced here.    [Illustration: MONK UNDERGOING DISCIPLINE.]    But these excesses were by no means confined to the monks. The Norman  barons and gentry adopted many of the manners of the English among  whom they lived, and especially was this the case in regard to the  drinking customs of Christmastide. Instead of commending the Normans  of his time for their sobriety, as he might have done their ancestors,  Peter of Blois, who was chaplain to Henry II., says: \"When you behold  our barons and knights going upon a military expedition you see their  baggage horses loaded, not with iron but wine, not with lances but  cheeses, not with swords but bottles, not with spears but spits. You  would imagine they were going to prepare a great feast rather than to  make war. There are even too many who boast of their excessive  drunkenness and gluttony, and labour to acquire fame by swallowing  great quantities of meat and drink.\" The earliest existing carol known  to antiquaries is in the Anglo-Norman language, and contains  references to the drinking customs of the period:--     \"To English ale, and Gascon wine,    And French, doth Christmas much incline--            And Anjou's too;    He makes his neighbour freely drink,    So that in sleep his head doth sink            Often by day.    May joys flow from God above    To all those who Christmas love.      Lords, by Christmas and the host    Of this mansion hear my toast--           Drink it well--    Each must drain his cup of wine,      And I the first will toss off mine:            Thus I advise,    Here then I bid you all _Wassail_,    Cursed be he who will not say Drinkhail.\"[17]    [Illustration: WASSAILING AT CHRISTMASTIDE.]    Proceeding with our historical narrative we come now to    [Illustration]      THE ROMANTIC REIGN OF RICHARD THE FIRST,    surnamed Coeur de Lion, the second son of Henry II. and Eleanor of  Aquitaine, who succeeded to the English throne on the death of his  father in 1189. Richard is generally supposed to have derived his  surname from a superiority of animal courage; but, if the metrical  romance bearing his name, and written in the thirteenth century, be  entitled to credit, he earned it nobly and literally, by plucking out  the heart of a lion, to whose fury he had been exposed by the Duke of  Austria for having slain his son with a blow of his fist. In the  numerous descriptions afforded by the romance Richard is a most  imposing personage. He is said to have carried with him to the  Crusades, and to have afterwards presented to Tancred, King of Sicily,  the wonder-working sword of King Arthur--     \"The gude sword Caliburne     that Arthur luffed so well.\"    He is also said to have carried a shaft, or lance, 14 feet in length,  and                  \"An axe for the nones,    To break therewith the Sarasyns bones.    The head was wrought right wele,    Therein was twenty pounds of steel.\"    But, without attempting to follow Richard through all the brilliant  episodes of his romantic career, there can be no doubt that he was a  king of great strength and courage, and that his valorous deeds won  the admiration of poets and chroniclers, who have surrounded him with  a splendid halo of romance. Contemporary writers tell us that while  Richard kept magnificent Christmases abroad with the King of Sicily  and other potentates, his justiciars (especially the extravagant  William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely) were no less lavish in their  expenditure for festive entertainments at home. And the old romance of  \"Richard Coeur de Lion\" assures us that--     \"Christmas is a time full honest;    Kyng Richard it honoured with gret feste.    All his clerks and barouns    Were set in their pavylouns,    And seryed with grete plente    Of mete and drink and each dainte.\"    There is no doubt that the Crusades had a vast influence upon our  literary tastes, as well as upon the national manners and the  festivities of Christmastide. On their return from the Holy Land the  pilgrims and Crusaders brought with them new subjects for theatrical  representation, founded on the objects of their devotion and the  incidents in their wars, and these found expression in the early  mysteries and other plays of Christmastide--that of St. George and the  Dragon, which survived to modern times, probably owing its origin to  this period. It is to Richard Coeur de Lion that we are indebted for  the rise of chivalry in England. It was he who developed tilts and  tournaments, and under his auspices these diversions assumed a  military air, the genius of poetry flourished, and the fair sex was  exalted in admiration. How delightful was it then, beneath the  inspiring gaze of the fair--     \"Sternly to strike the quintin down;    Or fiercely storm some turf-formed town;    To rush with valour's doughty sway,    Against a Babylon of clay;    A Memphis shake with furious shock,    Or raze some flower-built Antioch!\"[18]    On the death of Richard, in 1199, his brother      JOHN WAS CROWNED KING OF ENGLAND.    The youngest and favourite son of Henry II., John, was humoured in  childhood and grew to be an arrogant and petulant man, and was one of  the worst of English kings. He possessed ability, but not discipline.  He could neither govern himself nor his kingdom. He was tyrannical and  passionate, and spent a good deal of time in the gratification of his  animal appetites. He was fond of display and good living, and  extravagant in his Christmas entertainments. When, in 1201, he kept  Christmas at Guildford he taxed his purse and ingenuity in providing  all his servitors with costly apparel, and he was greatly annoyed  because the Archbishop of Canterbury, in a similar fit of sumptuary  extravagance, sought to outdo his sovereign. John, however, cunningly  concealed his displeasure at the time, but punished the prelate by a  costly celebration of the next Easter festival at Canterbury at the  Archbishop's expense. In consequence of John's frequent quarrels with  his nobles the attendance at his Christmas feasts became smaller every  year, until he could only muster a very meagre company around his  festive board, and it was said that he had almost as many enemies as  there were nobles in the kingdom.    In 1205 John spent his Christmas at the ancient town of Brill, in the  Vale of Aylesbury, and in 1213 he kept a Royal Christmas in the great  hall at Westminster.      MAGNA CHARTA DEMANDED AT A CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL.    The Christmas of 1214 is memorable in English history as the festival  at which the barons demanded from King John that document which as the  foundation of our English liberties is known to us by the name of  _Magna Charta_, that is, the Great Charter. John's tyranny and  lawlessness had become intolerable, and the people's hope hung on the  fortunes of the French campaign in which he was then engaged. His  defeat at the battle of Bouvines, fought on July 27, 1214, gave  strength to his opponents; and after his return to England the barons  secretly met at St. Edmundsbury and swore to demand from him, if  needful by force of arms, the restoration of their liberties by  charter under the king's seal. Having agreed to assemble at the Court  for this purpose during the approaching festival of Christmas they  separated. When Christmas Day arrived John was at Worcester, attended  only by a few of his immediate retainers and some foreign mercenaries.  None of his great vassals came, as was customary at Christmas, to  offer their congratulations. His attendants tried in vain to assume an  appearance of cheerfulness and festivity; but John, alarmed at the  absence of the barons, hastily rode to London and there shut himself  up in the house of the Knights Templars. On the Feast of the Epiphany  the barons assembled in great force at London and presenting  themselves in arms before the King formally demanded his confirmation  of the laws of Edward the Confessor and Henry I. At first John assumed  a bold and defiant air and met the barons with an absolute refusal  and threats; but, finding the nobles were firm, he sank to the  meanness of subterfuge, and pleaded the necessity of time for the  consideration of demands so weighty. With some reluctance the barons  granted the delay, and ultimately, in 1215, the tyrant bowed to the  inevitable, called the barons to a conference at Runnymede, and there  signed the Great Charter, whose most important clauses protect the  personal liberty and property of every freeman in the kingdom by  giving security from arbitrary imprisonment and unjust exactions.        [16] \"Short History of the Norman Conquest.\"        [17] Wassail and Drinkhail are both derived from the      Anglo-Saxon. They were the common drinking pledges of the      age. Wassail is equivalent to the phrase, \"Your health,\"      of the present day. Drinkhail, which literally signifies      \"drink health,\" was the usual acknowledgment of the other      pledge. The carol from which the verses are quoted was      evidently sung by the wandering minstrels who visited the      castles of the Norman nobility at the festive season of      Christmas.
