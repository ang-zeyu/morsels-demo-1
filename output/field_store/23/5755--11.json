In the Fabric Rolls are entries that show the  work of building proceeded with some activity and considerable  cheapness. Here are a few extracts that are interesting:    \"Twenty-five horse-loads of sand for the cloister, 9d. A thousand lath  nails and healing pins for do. S. Clifford sculpanti 18 capites 3/9: 10  do. 2/-.\"    By 1342 the work was probably finished to the north, and forty years  later the whole must have been completed. It has been said that the old  cloister was inferior to those of Worcester and Gloucester. But they  must have had considerable merit if Mr. Pearson's restoration really  represents, and there is little doubt it does, the old structure.    It is curious that the cloister, certainly the least offensive and not  the most beautiful part of the cathedral, should have suffered so  severely at the hands of the Puritans. For on the whole the cathedral  proper escaped with but small damage. Professor Freeman, in discussing  the alleged desecrations suffered by St. Mary and St. Peter, after the  entrance of Fairfax and his army into the city, writes thus: \"The  account in Mercurius Rusticus, which has given vogue to the common story  is wholly untrue.\" He further adds: \"Some fanatic soldier may, indeed,  according to the story, have broken off the head of Queen Elizabeth,  mistaking her for our Lady. But no general mutilation or desecration  took place at this time. And at Exeter, one form of mutilation, which  specially affected the west front, was not the work of enemies but of  devotees. For ages the country folk who came into the city loved to  carry home a Peter stone for the healing of their ailments.\" It is only  fair to add that Archdeacon Freeman refers in very different language to  the result of the occupation by the Puritans, but though the decorative  portions of the cloister may have suffered, we cannot account for the  disappearance of the exterior walls without a better reason for their  destruction. It should be noted, however, that in the fifteenth century  the Dean and Chapter bitterly complained of the conduct of the Exeter  boys, who played \"unlawfull games as the toppe, queke, penny pryke &  most atte tenys\" in the cloister, whereby they were \"defowled & the glas  windows all to-brost.\" But at this time the cathedral and municipal  authorities were far from friendly to each other. Dr. Oliver writes of  the ruins in his day that they \"have disappeared with the exception of  part of a fluted column at the west corner of the carpenter's shop.\"  With the debris small and mean houses were built. On the 30th of  October, 1657, we are given a hint as to what may have been the meaning  of this wanton destruction. Apparently the ground set apart for \"the  convenience of the studious and contemplative\" was found to have  valuable attributes as a market-place, for on the above day the \"Friday  cloth market for serges and other drapery\" was ordered to be held in  this place. Commerce did not triumph for long, though, as only three  years later the buyers and sellers were bundled back into South Street.    [Illustration: THE EAST GATE, PULLED DOWN IN 1784.]    A large number of bosses and carvings of the original structure,  discovered during the recent excavations, have been skilfully  incorporated by Mr. Pearson in his restoration. Above the cloister is a  library containing 8,000 volumes, many of them bequeathed by the late  Chancellor Harrington.    #The Close.#--This was an important adjunct to all cathedrals in the  days following the Conquest. We have seen that on one occasion at least  the cathedral church of Exeter was severely bombarded, with the result  that the northern tower differs considerably from the southern in  places. The church, then, we may presume, was intended to be used, when  necessary, as a fortress: but as it was also something else very  different, this necessity was rather shunned than courted. Therefore it  was customary to separate the church from the world by walls and gates  of proved strength. This space so secured formed an outer fortress,  against which the attacks of an enemy must, perforce, have been directed  first. It placed entirely in the hands of the clergy the defence of  their own church, a task they were quite capable of performing with  credit; for Matthew Paris tells us of one bishop of Exeter, Bruere, that  he displayed activity both \"spiritual and temporal\" in the Holy Land.  The defence of the city, that of the sacred building being thus provided  for, was the business of the captains and men-at-arms. The walls and  gates of the close have vanished, without leaving a trace of their  existence. One privilege, however, yet haunts the place--the corporation  have no jurisdiction over it.    In the close at the north side of the cathedral has been placed a statue  of Richard Hooker, the theologian (1553-1600), author of \"The Laws of  Ecclesiastical Polity.\" The \"Judicious Hooker\" was born in Exeter, and  was a nephew of John Vowel, alias Hoker, Chamberlain and Historian of  the city.    #The Cathedral Library# was founded by Leofric himself. One of his  principal reasons for translating the see from Crediton to Exeter being  his fear lest the valuable books he had collected should at any time be  destroyed by raiders in an unfortified town.    When, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, Sir Thomas Bodley,  himself a native of Exeter, founded the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the  Dean and Chapter of Exeter presented to it a large number of books and  manuscripts, many of which had belonged to Leofric. Fortunately one  volume remained in Exeter, overlooked by owners then unaware of its  value, possibly of its very existence. This volume, \"The Exeter Book,\"  is the greatest treasure possessed by the Dean and Chapter, being an  Anglo-Saxon manuscript, containing almost a third of all the Anglo-Saxon  literature that is known. The contents include \"Cynewulf's Christus,\" a  poem on the life of our Lord; some legends of saints; and a quaint  collection of riddles and jokes. The ink of its writing, nearly one  thousand years old, is as fresh as if it had been inscribed but  recently.    As already mentioned, the muniments room was formerly above St. Andrew's  Chapel. At a later date the library was placed in the Lady Chapel, and  was thence removed to the chapter house. Towards the end of the last  century Canon Cook and Chancellor Harrington left their valuable  libraries to the Dean and Chapter, and in order to accommodate the books  Dean Cowie restored the south side of the cloister, and built a new  library over it.    Here may be seen the Exeter Book, the Exeter Domesday, Grandisson's  Ordinale, Lacy's Pontifical, and other beautiful examples of  illumination. Also the original charter of Edward the Confessor  appointing Leofric Bishop of Exeter, signed by the King and Queen, Earl  Godwin, and a notable group of Saxon Thanes.    Among the printed books are a First Folio of Shakespeare, and the sealed  Prayer Book of King Charles II.    The library is open to the public after Matins on Tuesdays and Fridays.    #The Palace# is a building so closely associated with the cathedral as  to demand a brief notice. In it is the chapel of St. Mary, which seems  to have been frequently used in preference to the cathedral for the  celebration of espiscopal functions. Ordination services were often held  within its walls. It was originally built that services might be said  there for the repose of the souls of dead bishops of Exeter. A document  is quoted by Oliver, in which the parish of Alwyngton is called upon to  pay the officiating chaplain a yearly sum of four marks and that of  Harberton two. This chapel, now restored, is used for domestic purposes.  But at one time it was clearly regarded as pertaining to the cathedral,  for the Dean and Chapter, on the festival of St. Faith, presented to it  a pair of wax candles. Brantyngham, in 1381, mentions the \"fructus et  proventus cantariae infra Palatium nostrum Exonie, pro animabus  predecessorum nostorum ipsius fundatorum.\" The old entrance was under  the great archway, and battlements, by gracious permission of royalty,  surrounded the whole. In the great hall feasts were held for 100 poor  people; but the palace now is shorn of a good deal of its grandeur. The  Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1845 decided to rebuild and repair what  remained.    [Illustration: THE BISHOP'S PALACE.                 Alfred Pumphrey Photo.]      THE DIOCESE OF EXETER.    A chronological list of the bishops of the diocese, from the days of  Leofric, when the seat of the bishopric was removed from Crediton, to  our own day, when the diocese of Truro has been carved out from that of  Exeter, is here given briefly, since the more notable holders of the see  have been already mentioned in the first chapter.    #Leofric# (1046-1072). In 1050 the see was removed from Crediton and the  new See of Exeter founded.    #Osbern# (1072-1103). No alterations were made to the building during  this period. The bishop was admired for his \"simplicity of English  manners and habits,\" for although Norman by birth he had been educated  in England.    #William Warelwast# (1107-1136), a nephew of William the Conqueror,  began to demolish the Saxon Church. To him may be attributed the towers,  choir, apse, and nave of the Norman building. The story of his  blindness, and of his being sent on an embassy to Rome, rests on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19449"],[0,"The North American Indian, Vol. 1 (#13)"],[1,"celebration of the arrival of the period of puberty in  girls is more rigidly adhered to than any ancient religious rite or social  custom in vogue among the Apache. By this ceremony the social position of  the girl is established, and she is given assurance, on the eve of her  womanhood, of a long, happy, active life. At this critical period, if the  favor of the gods were not thus invoked in behalf of the girl, it might  augur ill for her in after life.    This Nalin Bagudzitash, or Girl Dance, is held always at dawn and is  brought to a close when the sun shines full upon the participants. The  ceremony is conducted by a woman selected from among the friends of the  girl's parents for her comeliness, activity, and good character. So far as  the performance of the successive parts of the ceremony is concerned, no  special knowledge on the part of the leader is required, as a medicine-man  is engaged to give the necessary directions and to sing the songs. The  girl lies on a blanket upon the ground, and her sponsor, so to speak,  straightens her arms and legs, rubs her joints, and otherwise simulates  remoulding and beautifying her body. The girl then sits up, and those  assembled dance and sing in a circle about her. An eagle feather and a  white-shell bead are tied in her hair, and sacred pollen is rubbed on her  face, in deference respectively to the bird of war and the god and goddess  of health and fructification--Hadintin Skhin and Hadintin Nalin.    When the dancing is finished the sponsor takes a basket of corn prepared  for ceremonial use and deposits it fifty yards or more to the east of the  circle. The girl arises and runs around the basket, then back to the  blanket on the ground, followed by little boys and girls. The godmother  then moves the basket farther away, and the girl runs around it again,  followed by children as before. This performance is repeated four times at  the east of the circle, after which the basket is carried around to the  south and the girl runs around it four times again, then to the west, and  lastly to the north. When she returns from her fourth run at the north the  girl stops on the blanket as usual, where the basket of corn is emptied on  her head. A lively scramble for the corn follows on the part of all  present, for it is deemed good fortune to bear away a handful of the  consecrated kernels, which, if planted, are certain to be very prolific.    The act of running out and back, followed by children, symbolically  attests that the young woman will be strong and active throughout life,  beloved by her offspring, who will always follow and obey her. That of  pouring corn upon her head is an invocation to the gods that she may be  blessed with fruitfulness.    The girl wears her ceremonial raiment of whitened deerskin or new white  muslin, with a white feather, a stone bead, and a piece of shell in her  hair, for four days after the performance, abstaining during that time  from flesh and from food containing salt, being careful, too, not to  scratch herself with her fingers. At the end of this period she bathes,  dons her usual clothing, and partakes of the customary food.          DANCE OF THE GODS      The Gaun Bagudzitash, or Dance of the Gods, is the one ceremony of the  Apache that bears any material resemblance to the many Yebichai dances or  \"chants\" of the Navaho, and even then the only feature common to the two  is that the men, typifying gods, wear elaborate masks. The Apache are not  unfamiliar with the making and employment of dry-paintings for the  treatment of the sick, as has been seen. Originally the dry-paintings and  the _gaun_, or gods, always appeared together, but in recent years the  Gaun dance has been conducted preliminary to and as a part of medicine,  puberty, and war ceremonies. Captain Bourke, in his \"Medicine-men of the  Apache\" (Ninth Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1892), speaks of this as  the Spirit or Ghost dance. Though performed infrequently now, as compared  with other dances, on account of the expense and of disapproval by the  agents, the Gaun Bagudzitash is unquestionably the most popular ceremony  conducted by the Apache.                          [Illustration: Apache _Gaun_]                                  Apache _Gaun_                 _From Copyright Photograph 1906 by E.S. Curtis_      Four always, but generally five, deities are impersonated in this  dance--Gaunchine{~COMBINING BREVE~} of the east, Gauncho of the south, Gaun of the west,  Gaunchi of the north, and Gauneski{~COMBINING BREVE~}de the fun-maker. These are arrayed in  short kilts, moccasins, and high stick hats supported upon tightly fitting  deerskin masks that cover the entire head. Each carries two flat sticks  about two feet in length, painted with zigzag lines representing  lightning.    For the dance a circular plot of ground, fifty or sixty feet in diameter,  is cleared of stones and brush, and four small cedar trees are planted  about its edge, one at each of the cardinal points. All in attendance  assemble in a circle outside the trees, leaving an opening at the eastern  side. Unheralded the five masked personators march in from the east and  take position in front of the cedar trees, the fifth man standing behind  the fourth at the northern side. Four drummers with small drums and an  indefinite number of drummers around a large one, at a signal from the  medicine-man in charge, who sings, begin drumming. The personated gods  dance all about the circle, making motions with their sticks as if picking  up and throwing something away, followed by blowing with the breath for  the purpose of expelling evil spirits from their midst. While this is  going on the fifth masker, Gauneskide, performs antics designed to amuse  the audience. When the songs are finished the dancers depart in an  eastwardly direction, whence they came, and all rest.    The drummers begin the next period in the dance by beating their tomtoms.  As soon as they commence the _gaun_ again appear, coming from the east as  before, and stop in single file in front of the cedar tree on the eastern  side. There the spectators throw _hadintin_ upon them and offer prayers,  after which the five _gaun_ take the same positions as before in front of  the small trees. Upon the trees little wheels of cedar twigs have been  hung; these the dancers now take, and each dances toward the fire in the  centre of the circle and back four times. As the gods dance back and forth  the people assembled in the encircling line shift their positions, so that  all the women are on the north side and all the men on the south; then the  entire body dances, with brief intervals of rest, while twelve songs are  sung. The maskers next form in single file on the east, march around the  fire, through the flames of which each passes the ends of his two sacred  wands to destroy any lurking evil, then back around the eastern cedar  tree, again around the fire, then to the southern tree, and so on to each  of the four trees, when they take their leave.    This much constitutes that part of the ceremony in which the _gaun_ are  the chief participants and which usually occupies half the night. The  remainder of the night is consumed by the performance of some ceremony  forming the principal objective--often the puberty rite above described.

Curtis_          HOME AND GENERAL CUSTOMS      The Jicarillas, or, as they are commonly called, \"Jicarilla Apaches,\"  occupy a reservation of nearly four hundred and fifty square miles of  mountainous country in northern New Mexico. Linguistically the Jicarillas  are of the same stock as the Apache of Arizona; but here the relationship  ceases, for the two peoples have virtually no knowledge one of the other;  each, according to their respective genesis myths, had their origin in the  general region in which they live to-day, while the dialect, mythology,  legends, and medicine rites of the Jicarillas more closely resemble those  of the Navaho than any of the Apache groups. The designation \"Jicarilla  Apaches\" is an inheritance from the early Spaniards, who were wont to  designate as Apache any warlike tribe which had not been brought under  subjection. Such were the Apaches de Nabaju (Navaho), the Apaches del  Perrillo, the Apaches Gilenos, Apaches Tejuas, Apaches Vaqueros, Apaches  Faraones, Apaches Llaneros, Apaches Lipanes, and a host of others, of whom  the Spanish missionaries and colonists had little or no knowledge except  that derived, alas, from predatory raids on the peaceable Indians among  whom they were established. The name \"Apache,\" therefore, was applied in  the Rio Grande country of New Mexico in much the same way as the term  \"Yavapai\" was given in the Rio Colorado region of Arizona, and, naturally  enough, it still survives.                           [Illustration: A Jicarilla]                                   A Jicarilla                 _From Copyright Photograph 1904 by E.S. Curtis_      Owing to their composite nature the Jicarillas are a peculiarly  interesting group. Too small in numbers to resist the cultural influence  of other tribes, and having been long in contact with the buffalo hunters  of the great plains as well as in close touch with the pueblo of Taos with  its great wealth of ceremony and ritual, it is not surprising that the  Jicarillas, in life and ceremony, have been deeply influenced by adjacent  tribes. As previously stated, the Jicarilla medicine rites are much like  those of the Navaho, but are far simpler in character. In dress the  Jicarillas resemble the Indians of"]]]
