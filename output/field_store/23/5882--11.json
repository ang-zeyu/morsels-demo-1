Some distance down a third slope, beautiful yellow  squashes turned their faces to the sun.    One day, the Spirit of the corn grew restless. There came a rustling  through the waving leaves, and a great sigh burst from the heart of the  tall stalks. The Spirit of the corn was lonely.    After that, every morning at sunrise, a handsome young chief was seen to  come and stand on the brow of the hill. On his head were shining red  plumes. Tall, and strong, and splendid he stood, wrapped in the folds of  his waving blanket, whose fringed tassels danced to the summer breeze.    \"_Che che hen! Che che hen!_ Some one I would marry! Some one I would  marry!\" the young chieftain would sing, many, many times.    One day, his voice reached the Squash Maiden, on the other side of the  hill. The Squash Maiden drew about her a rich green blanket, into which  she had woven many flaunting gold trumpet-shaped flowers. Then she ran  swiftly to the young chieftain.    [Illustration]    \"Marry me! Marry me!\" said the Squash Maiden, as she spread her  beautiful gold and green blanket at his feet.    Corn Plume looked down at the Squash Maiden sitting on her blanket at  his feet. She was good to look upon, and yet Corn Plume was not content.  He wanted a maiden who would stand by his side, not always sit at his  feet.    Then Corn Plume spoke thus to the Squash Maiden.    \"Corn Plume cannot marry Squash Maiden. She is very beautiful, but she  will not make song in Corn Plume's heart. Squash Maiden will grow tired  of his lodge. She will not stay in his wigwam. She likes to go a long  trail, and wander far from the lodge.    \"Corn Plume cannot make Squash Maiden his wife, for he is not content  with her. But she shall be Corn Plume's sister, and sit in his lodge  whenever she will. The maiden Corn Plume weds must be ever at his side.  She must go where he goes, stay where he stays.\"    Next morning at sunrise, the voice of Corn Plume was again heard,  singing from the hilltop, \"_Che che hen! Che che hen!_ Some one I would  marry! Some one I would marry! _Che che hen! Che che hen!_\"    This time his song reached the ears of the Bean Maiden. Her heart sang,  when she heard the voice of Corn Plume, for she knew that he was calling  her. So light of heart was Bean Maiden, that she ran like a deer up the  hillside. On and on, up and over the brow of the hill she climbed, till  she reached the young chieftain's side.    Then Corn Plume turned and beheld the most beautiful maiden he had ever  seen. Her eyes were deep and dark, like mountain pools. Her breath was  sweet as the waters of the maple. She threw off her blanket of green,  and purple, and white, and stretched her twining arms to him.    Corn Plume desired to keep Bean Maiden forever close to him. He bent his  tall plumed head to her. Her arms wound round and round the young  chieftain, and Corn Plume was content.    So closely were the arms of Corn Plume and the Bean Maiden entwined, so  truly were they wed, that the Indians never attempted to separate them.  Ever after, corn and beans were planted in the same hill, and often a  squash seed was added.    Since the Great Spirit had placed the corn, the bean, and the squash  together on a hill, the Indian said they should continue to live and  grow and occupy a hill together.    The door of Corn Plume's lodge was ever open to the Squash Maiden, if  she chose to enter. But seldom did she stay in his wigwam. More often,  she was found running off on a long trail.    But Bean Maiden remained true to Corn Plume. Always she was found by his  side. Never did she leave the lodge unless he went with her. Corn  Plume's lodge was her lodge, and her trail was his trail.    And because the Spirits of the corn and the bean are as one, the Indians  not only plant and grow them together, but cook and eat them together.  \"In life, they were one,\" they say, \"We will not separate them in  death.\"    And now, when a great rustling and sighing of the corn is heard in the  White man's land, the Indians often say, \"'Tis the Spirit of Corn Plume,  crying for his lost Bean Maiden!\"    [Illustration]          HOW THE ROBIN BURNED HIS BREAST      Some Indian hunters once made their way north, to hunt for moose. It was  at the time of Falling Leaves.    They journeyed for several days, until they came to a lake. Close by the  lake they built a log cabin. Moss was placed between the logs to keep  out the wind, and a thick roof was made from hemlock boughs. In the  center of the roof, a small opening was left for the smoke from the  lodge fire to pass out.    Here the hunters lived during the Moon of Falling Leaves. Every day they  went on the moose trail, but they found no moose. Their arrows brought  them little game of any kind. They became discouraged and sick, and one  by one the hunters lay down and died.    At last there was but one hunter left. He, too, was sick, and he grew  weaker day by day. His food was nearly gone. It was growing cold, and  there was little wood in the cabin to burn.    But the man did not give up. Again and again he cried aloud, \"Some one  will come and help me! Some one will come and help me!\"    One day, as he lay there too weak to rise, the fire flickered and went  out. It seemed that he must die. But even then he did not give up. Again  and again, with his weak voice he cried, \"Some one will come and help  me! Some one will come and help me!\"    And some one did come and help him. His cry was heard, for a bird came  flying in through the smoke hole in the roof of the lodge.    The bird had such a cheery, brave voice that the man felt better the  moment he flew in. The bird said to the man, \"I was near; I heard you  calling. I have come to help you.\"    Then the bird saw that the fire was out, and that the man was cold. He  fluttered among the ashes until he found a bit of live coal. With a glad  chirp, he flew out through the roof. Soon he was back, with his bill  full of dried twigs. He placed them on the fire and began to fan them  into flame with his wings. Soon the twigs were blazing. Then he flew out  for more twigs,--and more, and more, and more.    The brave little bird kept on carrying twigs until the fire burned hot,  and the lodge was warm once more.    When the bird had flown into the lodge, he had had a clean, white  breast. After the fire was built, his breast was covered with red and  brown spots. He tried to pick them off with his bill, but they would  not come off. Instead, they seemed to spread, and his whole breast  became red-brown. Then the bird knew that he must have burned his breast  to a red-brown, when he was fanning the fire into flame.    But the little bird did not care if he had soiled his white breast, and  burned it red-brown. Had he not brought cheer and life to a dying man?    He chirped a few glad notes, then said to the man, \"I will go now, but I  shall be near your lodge. When you need me, call, and I will come  again.\"    Later in the day, the man again called for help. The fire was getting  low, and he was not yet strong enough to go out and gather twigs. Again  the bird came to his aid. In and out he flew, many times, after small  branches and twigs, until they were piled high on the fire, and once  more it crackled and burned.    There was a little wood in the lodge. The man placed it on the fire,  and the warmth healed the man, so that soon he was well and strong  again.    Every day the man talked with the bird, for he was always near, and his  cheery voice and brave words gave the man courage.    Once more he went on the moose trail, and this time his arrows brought  him moose. In a short time the hunter had all the meat, skins, and moose  hair he wanted. The moose hair he was taking to his wife, to work into  pretty forms on moccasins.    The first snow was falling, as the hunter started south on the home  trail. The bird hopped along by his side for a little way, then said, \"I  must leave you now. Winter is coming, and I must be on my way to the  Southland, or the snow will catch me. In the spring you will see me  again.\"    When spring came, the bird with the red-brown breast came with his mate,  and built a nest close to the hunter's home lodge. In the nest, that  summer, there grew up five little birds, and they, too, had red and  brown breasts.    And ever since, Robin Redbreast has continued to come and build his nest  close to the lodges of men, for Robin Redbreast is a friend to man.    [Illustration]          IROQUOIS FAIRY STORIES    [Illustration]          HOW MORNING STAR LOST HER FISH      Once the Little People, the Indian fairies, ran with the Red Children  through the woods, and played with them beside the streams. Now they are  not often seen, for the white man drove them out of the woods with the  Indians, and away from the waters, with his big steam noises.    But before steamboats and great mills were on the streams, the Little  People were there. They were often seen paddling their tiny canoes, or  sliding down the great rocks on the banks. They loved to slide down a  bank where one rock jutted out, for then they had a big bounce. They  also liked to sport and jump with the fish.    There was a young Indian girl whose name was Morning Star. She was  called Morning Star because her face was so bright, and she was always  up early in the morning.    Morning Star lived with her father in a comfortable wigwam by a river.  Every day she would get up with the sun, and run down to the river where  the great rocks were, to catch fish for breakfast.    Morning Star caught her fish in a basket. At night, she would go and  fasten her basket between the rocks, in a narrow place of the stream.  Then, when the fish swam through in the night, they would get caught in  it, and Morning Star would find plenty of fish waiting for her. In the  morning, she would take the basket of fish back to the wigwam, and soon  the smell of fish frying on hot coals"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/221"],[0,"The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#13)"],[1,"to-morrow, and to take our friend  some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.\"    I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes  liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way; so I  waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence.    But there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of  impatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every  ring of the bell. On the evening of the second there came a letter from  Hilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had  appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sun-dial. He inclosed a  copy of it, which is here reproduced:--    GRAPHIC    Holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then  suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay.  His face was haggard with anxiety.    \"We have let this affair go far enough,\" said he. \"Is there a train to  North Walsham to-night?\"    I turned up the time-table. The last had just gone.    \"Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,\"  said Holmes. \"Our presence is most urgently needed. Ah! here is our  expected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson; there may be an answer. No,  that is quite as I expected. This message makes it even more essential  that we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton Cubitt know how  matters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our  simple Norfolk squire is entangled.\"    So, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a story  which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre I experience once  again the dismay and horror with which I was filled. Would that I had  some brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the  chronicles of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange  chain of events which for some days made Ridling Thorpe Manor a  household word through the length and breadth of England.    We had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and mentioned the name of our  destination, when the station-master hurried towards us. \"I suppose that  you are the detectives from London?\" said he.    A look of annoyance passed over Holmes's face.    \"What makes you think such a thing?\"    \"Because Inspector Martin from Norwich has just passed through. But  maybe you are the surgeons. She's not dead--or wasn't by last accounts.  You may be in time to save her yet--though it be for the gallows.\"    Holmes's brow was dark with anxiety.    \"We are going to Ridling Thorpe Manor,\" said he, \"but we have heard  nothing of what has passed there.\"    \"It's a terrible business,\" said the station-master. \"They are shot,  both Mr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife. She shot him and then herself--so  the servants say. He's dead and her life is despaired of. Dear, dear,  one of the oldest families in the County of Norfolk, and one of the most  honoured.\"    Without a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven  miles' drive he never opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so  utterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all our journey from  town, and I had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with  anxious attention; but now this sudden realization of his worst fears  left him in a blank melancholy. He leaned back in his seat, lost in  gloomy speculation. Yet there was much around to interest us, for we  were passing through as singular a country-side as any in England, where  a few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on  every hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat,  green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia.  At last the violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over the green edge  of the Norfolk coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old  brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees. \"That's  Ridling Thorpe Manor,\" said he.    As we drove up to the porticoed front door I observed in front of  it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled  sun-dial with which we had such strange associations. A dapper little  man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just  descended from a high dog-cart. He introduced himself as Inspector  Martin, of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he was considerably astonished  when he heard the name of my companion.    \"Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning.  How could you hear of it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?\"    \"I anticipated it. I came in the hope of preventing it.\"    \"Then you must have important evidence of which we are ignorant, for  they were said to be a most united couple.\"    \"I have only the evidence of the dancing men,\" said Holmes. \"I will  explain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to  prevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge  which I possess in order to ensure that justice be done. Will you  associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act  independently?\"    \"I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr. Holmes,\"  said the inspector, earnestly.    \"In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the  premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.\"    Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things  in his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the  results. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down  from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt's room, and he reported that her injuries were  serious, but not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed through the  front of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could  regain consciousness. On the question of whether she had been shot or  had shot herself he would not venture to express any decided opinion.  Certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There  was only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had  been emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was  equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that  she had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway  between them.    \"Has he been moved?\" asked Holmes.    \"We have moved nothing except the lady. We could not leave her lying  wounded upon the floor.\"    \"How long have you been here, doctor?\"    \"Since four o'clock.\"    \"Anyone else?\"    \"Yes, the constable here.\"    \"And you have touched nothing?\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"You have acted with great discretion. Who sent for you?\"    \"The housemaid, Saunders.\"    \"Was it she who gave the alarm?\"    \"She and Mrs. King, the cook.\"    \"Where are they now?\"    \"In the kitchen, I believe.\"    \"Then I think we had better hear their story at once.\"    The old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a  court of investigation. Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his  inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face. I could read in them  a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he  had failed to save should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin,  the old, grey-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village  policeman made up the rest of that strange company.    The two women told their story clearly enough. They had been aroused  from their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed  a minute later by a second one. They slept in adjoining rooms, and Mrs.  King had rushed in to Saunders. Together they had descended the stairs.  The door of the study was open and a candle was burning upon the table.  Their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room. He was quite  dead. Near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against  the wall. She was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red  with blood. She breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything.  The passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of  powder. The window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. Both  women were positive upon the point. They had at once sent for the  doctor and for the constable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the  stable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room. Both  she and her husband had occupied the bed. She was clad in her dress--he  in his dressing-gown, over his night clothes. Nothing had been moved in  the study. So far as they knew there had never been any quarrel between  husband and wife. They had always looked upon them as a very united  couple.    These were the main points of the servants' evidence. In answer to  Inspector Martin they were clear that every door was fastened upon the  inside, and that no one could have escaped from the house. In answer  to Holmes they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell  of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the  top floor. \"I commend that fact very carefully to your attention,\" said  Holmes to his professional colleague. \"And now I think that we are in a  position to undertake a thorough examination of the room.\"    The study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books,  and with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out  upon the garden. Our first attention was given to the body of the  unfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room. His  disordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep.  The bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in  his body after penetrating the heart. His death had certainly been  instantaneous and painless. There was no powder-marking either upon his  dressing-gown or on his hands. According to the country surgeon the lady  had stains upon her face, but none upon her hand.    \"The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may  mean everything,\" "]]]
