Burr tried  to escape responsibility by pleading absence when the contracts were  made; but the question never ceased coming up--if absence included all  the months of McComb's negotiations, what time did the Attorney-General  give to public business?    It was a deep grief to Jay that the Livingstons opposed him. The  Chancellor and Edward were his wife's cousins, Brockholst her brother.  Brockholst had been Jay's private secretary at the embassy in Madrid,  but now, to use a famous expression of that day, \"the young man's head  was on fire,\" and violence characterised his political feelings and  conduct. Satirical letters falsely attributed to Jay fanned the sparks  of the Livingston opposition into a bright blaze, and, although the  Chief Justice denied the insinuation, the Chancellor gave battle with  the enthusiasm of a new convert.    As one glances through the list of workers in the campaign of 1792, he  is reminded that the juniors or beginners soon came to occupy higher  and more influential positions than some of their elders and leaders.  DeWitt Clinton, for instance, not yet in office, was soon to be in the  Assembly, in the State Senate, and in the United States Senate--a  greater force than any man of his time in New York, save Hamilton.  James Kent had just entered the Assembly. As a student in Egbert  Benson's office, his remarkable industry impressed clients and  teacher, but when his voice sounded the praises of John Jay, few could  have anticipated that this young man, small in stature, vivacious in  speech, quick in action, with dark eyes and a swarthy complexion, was  destined to become one of the most famous jurists in a century.  Ambrose Spencer had not yet scored his first political honour, but his  herculean frame and stately presence, with eyes and complexion darker  than Kent's, are to be seen leading in every political contest for  more than forty years.    There were also Smith Thompson, taught in the law by Chancellor Kent  and tutored in politics by George Clinton, who was to follow the  former Chief Justice and end his days on the United States Supreme  bench; Joseph C. Yates, founder of Union College, and Samuel L.  Mitchill, scientist and politician, who has been called the Franklin  of New York. Younger than these, but equally alert, was Cadwallader A.  Colden, grandson of the royal lieutenant-governor of Stamp Act days.  He was now only twenty-two, just beginning at the bar, but destined to  be the intimate friend of Robert Fulton, a famous leader of a famous  bar, and a political chieftain of a distinguished career.[63]    [Footnote 63: Interested in this exciting campaign was yet a younger  generation, who soon contested their right-of-way to political  leadership. Erastus Root was a junior at Dartmouth; Daniel D. Tompkins  had just entered Columbia; Martin Van Buren was in a country school on  the farm at Kinderhook; John Treat Irving was playing on the banks of  the river to be made famous by his younger brother; and William W. Van  Ness, the rarest genius of them all, and his younger cousin, William  P. Van Ness, were listening to the voices that would soon summon them,  one in support of the brilliant Federalist leader, the other as a  second to Aaron Burr in the great tragedy at Weehawken on the 11th of  July, 1804.]    At the election, the people gave Jay a majority of their votes; but at  the count, a majority of the state canvassers gave Clinton the  governorship. This was the first vicious party precedent established  in the Empire State. It has had many successors at the polls, in the  Legislature, and at the primaries, but none bolder and more harmful,  or ruder and more outrageously wrong. Under the law, inspectors of  election sealed the ballots, delivered them to the sheriff or his  deputy, who conveyed them to the secretary of state. In Otsego County,  Richard R. Smith's term as sheriff had expired, and the new sheriff  had not yet qualified, but Smith delivered the ballots to a person  specially deputised by him. Tioga's sheriff turned the ballots over  to his deputy, who, being taken ill on the journey, handed them to a  clerk for transmission. In Clinton the sheriff gave the votes to a man  without deputation. No ballots were missing, no seals were broken, nor  had their delivery been delayed for a moment. But as soon as it became  known that these counties gave Jay a majority of about four hundred,  quite enough to elect him, it was claimed that the votes had not been  conveyed to the secretary of state by persons authorised to do so  under the law, and the canvassers, voting as their party preferences  dictated, ruled out the returns by a vote of seven to four in  Clinton's favour. The discussion preceding this action, however, was  so acrimonious and the alleged violation of law so technical, that the  board agreed to refer the controversy to Rufus King and Aaron Burr,  the United States senators.    Burr had many an uneasy hour. He preferred to avoid the  responsibility, since an opinion might jeopardise his political  interests. If he found for Clinton, his Federalist friends would take  offence; if he antagonised Clinton, the anti-Federalists would cast  him out. Thus far it had been his policy to keep in the background,  directing others to act for him; now he must come out into the open.  He temporised, delayed, sought suggestions of friends, and endeavoured  to induce his colleague to join him in declining to act as a referee,  but King saw no reason for avoiding an opinion, and in answering the  question of the canvassers, he took the broad ground that an election  law should be construed in furtherance of the right of suffrage. The  act was for the protection of voters whose rights could not be  jeopardised by the negligence or misconduct of an agent charged with  the delivery of the ballots, nor by canvassers charged with their  counting. It was preposterous to suppose that the sudden illness of a  deputy, or the failure of an official to qualify, could disfranchise  the voters of a whole county. If it were otherwise, then the foolish  or intentional misconduct of a sheriff might at any time overturn the  will of a majority. There was no pretence of wrong-doing. The ballots  had been counted, sealed, and delivered to the secretary of state no  less faithfully than if there had been a technical adherence to the  strict letter of the law. He favoured canvassing Tioga's vote,  therefore, although it was doubtful if a deputy sheriff could deputise  a deputy, while the vote of Clinton should be canvassed because a  sheriff may deputise by parol. As to Otsego, on which the election  really turned, King held that Smith was sheriff until a successor  qualified, if not in law, then in fact; and though such acts of a _de  facto_ officer as are voluntarily and exclusively beneficial to  himself are void, those are valid that tend to the public utility.    Burr was uninfluenced by respect for suffrage. Being statutory law, it  must be construed literally, not in spirit, or because of other rights  involved. He agreed with his colleague as to the law governing the  Clinton case; but following the letter of the act, he held that  Tioga's votes ought not to be counted, since a deputy could not  appoint a deputy. The Otsego ballots were also rejected because the  right of a sheriff to hold over did not exist at common law; and as  the New York statute did not authorise it, Smith's duties ceased at  the end of his term; nor could he be an officer _de facto_, since he  had accepted and exercised for one day the office of supervisor, which  was incompatible with that of sheriff. In other words, Burr reduced  the question of Jay's election to Smith's right to act, and to avoid  the _de facto_ right, so ably presented by Senator King, he relied  upon Smith's service of a day as supervisor before receiving and  forwarding the ballots, notwithstanding sheriffs invariably held over  until their successors qualified. Seven of such cases had occurred in  fifteen years, and never before had the right been seriously  questioned. In one instance a hold-over sheriff had executed a  criminal. When urged to appoint a sheriff for Otsego earlier in the  year, Governor Clinton excused his delay because the old one could  hold over.    After this decision, only Clinton himself could avert the judgment  certain to be rendered by a partisan board. Nevertheless, the Governor  remained silent. Thus, by a strict party vote of seven to four, the  canvassers, omitting the three counties with four hundred majority in  Jay's favour, returned 8,440 votes for Clinton and 8,332 for Jay.  Then, to destroy all evidence of their shame, the ballots were burned,  although the custom obtained of preserving them in the office of the  secretary of state.[64]    [Footnote 64: A few days after Clinton's inauguration Burr wrote a  Federalist friend: \"I earnestly wished and sought to be relieved from  the necessity of giving any opinion, particularly as it would be  disagreeable to you and a few others whom I respect and wish always to  gratify; but the conduct of Mr. King left me no alternative. I was  obliged to give an opinion.... It would, indeed, be the extreme of  weakness in me to expect friendship from Mr. Clinton. I have too many  reasons to believe that he regards me with jealousy and  malevolence.... Some pretend, but none can believe, that I am  prejudiced in his favour. I have not even seen or spoken to him since  January last.\" This letter had scarcely been delivered when Clinton  appointed him to the Supreme Court, an office which Burr declined,  preferring to remain in the Senate.]    News travelled slowly in those days.

Stith says after the return of Newport from his expedition of discovery  up James river \"No sooner were they landed but the President (Smith)  dispersed as many as were able, some to make Glass and others for  Pitch,\" &c.; and in 1609, \"And now the Colony pursued their business  with alacrity and success. They made three or four lasts of Tar, Pitch,  and Soap ashes and produced a trial of glass,\" &c., &c. And in 1621,  speaking of the subscriptions opened in England, he says, \"The third  roll was for a glass furnace to make beads, which was the current coin  in the Indian trade; and one Captaine Norton, with some Italian workmen,  was sent over for that purpose.\" See also Stith, pp. 95, 97, 197, 198.  As the names of Vincentio and Benardo appear in the text, we may infer  that some of the Italian workmen survived the massacre of 1622.      _At Archur's Hoop._[Z]      Lieutenant Harris,    Rowland Lottis,      _uxor_ Lottis,    John Elison,      _uxor_ Elison,    George Sanders,    Thomas Corder,    Joseph Johnson,    George Pran,    John Bottom,    Thomas Farley,      _uxor_ Farley,      a child,    Nicholas Shotton.

At  the Assembly in 1619, he and the privileges named in his patent, and  certain charges against him of unfair dealing with the Indians occupied  no little attention.--See ante, pp. 12 and 13.
