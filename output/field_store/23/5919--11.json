One rock, surrounded at high water by the tide, is a square block of red  granite of thirty to forty feet high, placed on the top of a still higher  mass, on which it rests upon a very small base. It is called the \"Roche  Pendue,\" and serves as a landmark for the fishermen. We took a small boat  full of fish resembling codlings or small cod, called \"lieu,\" and were  rowed by the fishermen through a sea of granite boulders to the opposite  side of the Tregastel estuary, to see the \"pierre pendue,\" or  rocking-stone (Breton, _rouler_), the largest in Brittany. These stones  are so nicely poised that they can be moved with the slightest impulse by  any one knowing the exact point at which to touch them. They were used in  early times as proving-stones, and called \"Pierres de verite.\"                          \"Firm as it seems,      Such is its strange and virtuous property,      It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch      Of him whose breast is pure; but to a traitor,      Though e'en a giant's prowess nerved his arm,      It stands as fixed as Snowdon.\" --MASON.      Or, as Sir Walter Scott alludes to them,--            \"Some, chance-poised and balanced, lay      So that a stripling arm might sway        A mass no host could raise,      In nature's rage at random thrown,      Yet trembling like the Druid's Stone,        On its precarious base.\" --LORD OF THE ISLES.      The council of Nantes, in the seventh century, ordered the bishops to have  the rocking-stones destroyed. The coarse rose-coloured granite of this  coast resembles the Egyptian.    We rowed back to the little inn at Ploumanach, and had some eggs and a hot  langouste or rock-lobster. This kind is more plentiful on the coast of  Brittany than the common, but these rocky shores abound in both sorts. The  village of Ploumanach is built nearly into the sea, in the midst of rocks  overhanging the harbour. It is almost exclusively frequented by fishermen;  in the front is a group of rocks or islands called Les Sept Iles; the Ile  aux Moines, the most important among them, is strongly fortified, and is  directly opposite Ploumanach. At the inn we found a German artist employed  in making sketches in oil of this strange coast. It was late when we  reached Lannion, a town prettily situated in the valley of Leguer; it  contains no remarkable buildings except a few houses of the period of  Henry IV. and Louis XIII. in the market-place. The mackerel and other  fisheries are carried on from here, the grande and petite peche, the  \"lieu\" is taken in shoals and salted. The seaweed or wrack (_Fucus  vesiculosus_) called goemon, is extensively collected along the coasts of  Brittany for fertilising the lands and also for fuel, which last is so  scarce that even cow-dung is collected and dried against the walls for the  same use. The gathering of goemon takes place in March and September, and  employs the whole population of the district. Souvestre says, that on the  appointed day for gathering the crop, horses, oxen, cows, dogs, every  animal, and every machine, is put into requisition. Women and children all  are assembled in the bays, sometimes to the number of 10,000 persons; but,  to allow the poor to have the full advantage, the custom is, on the first  day, to admit only the necessitous of the parish. These borrow their  neighbours' vehicles, and collect a good crop. It is called \"the day of  the poor.\" The goemon grows on rocks at a distance from the shore, and the  peasants not having sufficient boats to collect it tie the heaps together  with cords on to branches of trees and form a raft, on which the whole  family is launched; a barrel is attached at the end, and the unsteady  craft often rolls over and its cargo is precipitated into the water. The  fine sands of the sea shore are also carted and laid on the heavy lands to  divide the soil. Ascending the valley of the Leguer, about eight miles  from Lannion, on the opposite side of the river, we turned down a muddy  lane, and getting out into a field saw in front of us the imposing castle  of Tonquedec, perhaps the finest remains in Brittany of military  architecture, dating from the fourteenth century. It crowns the summit of  a hill, wooded down to the river's edge, with water-mills and a little  village at the foot, the bright sparkling river running through the deep  wild valley; nothing can exceed the picturesque effect of these ruins when  seen from the opposite bank. Tonquedec has belonged from time immemorial  to the Viscomtes de Coetmen, who held the first rank among the nobles of  Brittany, but one of them espousing the cause of the Constable Clisson  against Duke John IV. saw his fortress demolished. It was restored under  Henry IV., and again dismantled by order of Cardinal Richelieu, who hated  castles and their nobility. The castle is an irregular four-sided figure.  It had an outer enclosure, and was entered by a drawbridge, and furnished  with every imaginable fortification. Three sides were surrounded by  dwellings, among these a fine roofed salle d'armes remains. A flying  bridge led to the keep, which was of four stories, but the entrance on the  first story, so that in case of siege the garrison might retire to the  keep, and hold out till want of provisions or ammunition compelled them to  surrender. The towers and walls remain, the latter are ten feet thick.    On our way to Plouaret we drove up to the chateau of Kergrist, a square  edifice with pepper-box towers at each angle, in good preservation,  occupied by a lady of the name of Douglas. Our driver could not find the  way to the \"Chapelle des Sept Saints,\" built over a dolmen, which lay near  the station at Plouaret, whence we proceeded by rail, and, entering the  department of Finistere, shortly after reached Morlaix over its  magnificent granite viaduct, the most important among the many which occur  between Rennes and Brest. The railway runs parallel to the coast, and  traverses, not far from their mouths, the streams which abound in this  \"pays accidente.\" This gigantic work is one-sixth of a mile (292 yards)  long, and consists of two tiers of arches, fourteen in the upper line and  nine below.    Morlaix is picturesquely built on the sides of three ravines, so steep  that the saying goes, \"De la mansarde au jardin, comme on dit a Morlaix.\"  It is situated on a tidal river, about eight miles from the sea, ascended  by small vessels, which give the place a lively appearance. Few towns have  so many beautiful timbered houses of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  remaining. One of the most curious is that belonging to a miller, No. 19,  in the Rue des Nobles, a street where the houses are built one story  projecting over the other, so that the top stories of the opposite houses  nearly touch each other and exclude the light. The fronts, gable-shaped,  have their enormous beams richly carved, and supported by brackets and  statues of St. Yves or other favourite saints; some are overlaid with  lozenge-shaped slates, and finished at the point with a leaden \"epi,\" or  ornamental terminal. All have a kind of hall, panelled and sculptured to  the roof, the staircases richly sculptured and supported by a pillar  carved from top to bottom with statues of saints or grotesque figures  superposed one over the other. Among the statuettes in the house, No. 19,  are the figures of St. Roch and his dog; St. Christopher carrying the  infant Jesus, St. Michael, and various others. On another staircase, in  better preservation, but not so richly carved (at the Veuve Perron's, No.  14, Grande Rue), are female saints,--the Virgin, St. Catherine, and St.  Barbara.    Morlaix gave a grand reception to the Queen-Duchess Anne, when on her  pilgrimage through Brittany in 1505. The town presented her with a little  ship of gold, bearing the arms of the city, and enriched with precious  stones, and a tame ermine with a diamond collar round its neck. Anne  received the ermine, and caressed the little animal, who returned her  endearments, and, at length, suddenly concealed itself in her bosom, which  unexpected proceeding startled the Queen, when the Seigneur du Rohan, who  was by her side, exclaimed, \"What do you fear, madam; is not the ermine  your cognisance?\" No less enthusiastic was the reception given by the  citizens of Morlaix forty years later (1548) to Mary Stuart, then only  five years old, on her landing in France. She was lodged in the convent of  the Jacobins, and assisted at the Te Deum in the church of Notre  Dame-du-Mur. When passing through one of the gates on her way back, the  drawbridge, overloaded with spectators, gave way, and several persons were  thrown into the water. Mary's Scottish attendants cried out \"Treason!\" but  the Seigneur de Rohan, who was on horseback by the side of the royal  litter, indignantly exclaimed, \"Jamais Breton ne fit trahison.\" The  loyalty and good faith of the Bretons is proverbial. \"En tout chemin,  loyaute,\" is a Breton motto,(8) and it is one of the virtues attributed to  them by a Breton writer, who assigns to them four virtues and three vices.  Their virtues consist in a love of their country and their home,  resignation to the will of the Almighty, loyalty to each other, and  hospitality. Their vices are avarice, contempt for women, and drunkenness.  Their love of country and home is carried to an extent, rivalling, if not  exceeding, that of the Swiss. The Breton not only loves the village where  he was born, but he loves the field of his fathers, the hearth and the  clock of his home, even the bed on which he was born, and on which he  hopes to close his eyes. The conscript and sailor are often known to die  of grief when away from their native land. Brittany possesses for its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#13)"],[1,"probably is either that he has collected books upon no definite  system, or that he has lost sight of the many works which his library  should contain, through having confined himself too rigidly to  specialism.    Both practices are bad, though the former is infinitely the worse. To  collect books indiscriminately tends to develop the dread bibliomania. To  specialise in a particular class of books should be the object of every  collector; but to adhere so rigidly to that one class of literature as to  exclude from our library the great books of the world, is to deprive  ourselves of all the advantages which a library can offer. 'There are  some books, as Homer, Virgil, Horace, Milton, Shakespeare, and Scott,  which every man should read who has the opportunity; should read, mark,  learn and inwardly digest. To neglect the opportunity of becoming  familiar with them, is deliberately to sacrifice the position in the  social scale which an ordinary education enables its possessor to  reach.'[20] What a number of famous names one can add, without which no  library worthy the name can be complete! We are not all such sages as  that great man Philip Melanchthon, whose library is said to have  consisted of four authors only, namely, Plato, Pliny, Plutarch, and  Ptolemy the geographer. But then, these are whole libraries in  themselves.    Who, beside ourselves, shall decide what we shall read? 'A man's reading,  to be of any value,' wrote Professor Blackie, 'must depend upon his power  of association; and that again depends upon his tendencies, his  capacities, his surroundings, and his opportunities.' But there are some  authors whom the world has decided are great, whom we cannot possibly  afford to neglect in the course of our literary education. There can be  no doubt as to our decision here; and although it has been said truly  that 'a lifetime will hardly suffice to know, as they ought to be known,  these great masterpieces of man's genius,'[21] yet these great classics  should form the nucleus of our library, and to them we may add the other  famous and approved books of the world as opportunities occur.    It is not without diffidence that I venture to approach this important  question as to what we should read. Perhaps there is nothing more  irritating to the real book-lover than to be told, usually by some  well-meaning person, that he or she should read this or that. In nine  cases out of ten the book or author recommended is one that we can safely  afford to neglect. It is one of the commonest of human failings to  imagine that a book which pleases us must necessarily please all others  too, and we recommend it blindly to the first friend we come across,  regardless of age, disposition, intellectual capacity, opportunity,  surroundings, or even sex. It never even occurs to us to consider these  matters, these vital qualities upon which the whole question of like or  dislike depends.    'To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under  heaven'; and again, 'A wise man's heart discerneth both time and  judgment,' wrote the Preacher of Judah. Yet mindful though we be of these  ancient words of wisdom, how rarely do we apply them to our everyday  reading! If we be in the mood for reading we pick up any book at random;  if it please us at the moment, we continue to read it. If it be  distasteful to us, we put it aside immediately. Possibly we recollect,  next time that our eyes light upon a volume so discarded, that it was  once displeasing, and we never take it up again. So, it may be urged, our  mind exercises the power of selection for us: we can only absorb at any  given time the class of literary food for which our mind then happens to  be hungry.    But the truth is far otherwise. If we take up and read a book at random,  in nine cases out of ten we continue to read it simply because it entails  no mental effort. We do not have to think of what we are reading; our  eyes gallop over sentence after sentence, and so long as the language is  colloquial and the facts are bald, all is well, and we can go on and on.  It is not only the body that, unchecked, is inclined to be slothful.  Unless we have as complete a control over our minds as we have over our  limbs, it is quite impossible that our reading shall benefit us to its  full extent.    There is another point of view also. 'Every book that we take up without  a purpose is an opportunity lost of taking up a book with a purpose.'[22]  And this does not mean that we should always be reading 'improving'  books, that we must never read for recreation alone; for, I repeat,  'there is a time to every purpose under heaven.' But it does insist most  emphatically that there should be a rhyme and a reason for reading any  book at any time. There is a time for work and a time for play in reading  no less than in the daily cycle of our lives. As to what shall constitute  recreative reading, that is a matter which every man must decide for  himself. I will venture to prophesy, however, that, by judicious  selection and thoughtful reading, there will come a time when he will  consider the reading of the great books to constitute the finest mental  recreation in the world.    To return, however, to the great writers, those giants of whom we have  said that it behoves us all to know something at least. Must we read them  all? Let us leave 'must' out of the question; for our lifetime, however  long it may be, will be scarcely sufficient to know and appreciate to the  full these great masters of human thought. Yet at least it can be our aim  ever to feed our minds only upon food of the finest quality and of a  permanent nutritive value. But alas! How terribly limited are our  capacities both as regards time and opportunity! How narrow the bounds  which confine our reading abilities! Though a list of the great writers  contain all the constituents of an Epicurean feast, yet to most of us it  resembles the menu of a Gargantuan banquet.    As to the classics of the old world, surely, it may be urged, in such an  essentially practical age we can afford to neglect books so hopelessly  out of date? Yet there can be no greater mistake than to imagine that the  wisdom of the old world can ever be out of date, for it is the wisdom  that has created the civilisation of the newer world. Countless  generations of men may pass away and be utterly forgotten, but the  principles of morality inherent in man's nature will endure for ever. And  it is these great principles of all that is good and noble in our nature  that is brought out and developed insensibly by the study of the classics  in our youth. Moreover they are books that have been accepted by all the  nations of Europe as containing the bases of human thought. Something at  least we should all know of these great writers common to all civilised  nations.    To most of us, however, there is an insurmountable barrier surrounding  them, the matter of language. The knowledge of Greek and Latin that we  acquired at school has become painfully rusty. Is it worth while slogging  away laboriously with grammar and dictionary at the expense of valuable  time which might otherwise be devoted to the more modern classics in our  own tongue? Candidly, it is not. If we have retained sufficient of our  Greek and Latin to read it at sight with but an occasional reference to  the dictionary well and good; but otherwise it is a painful waste of  time. Hamerton recommends that we read the ancients with the help of  literal translations beside the original, in which way, he says, we 'may  attain a closer acquaintance with ancient literature than would be  possible by translation alone.' But to many, an English version must be  the only door by which they may enter Attica and Rome.    After all, it is for each one of us to decide how widely our time and  opportunities shall permit us to wander on the slopes of Mount Parnassus.  'The best time-savers are the love of soundness in all we learn to do,  and a cheerful acceptance of inevitable limitations.'[23] Yet it is  better to have wandered on the lowermost slopes of the mountain than  never to have entered ancient Greece at all.    Who nowadays, outside the universities, reads these ancient classics?  Where will you find a business man of thirty years of age whose delight  in his leisure time is the reading of Horace or Homer? Here and there,  perhaps, you may come across a man of classical education who still  retains the love of ancient Greece and Rome, instilled into him in his  youth, sufficiently to influence the course of his reading; but he is a  rarity indeed. Among the many thousands of young men employed in business  in the great cities, most of whom have learnt something at least of the  classics in their youth, scarcely will you find one who will confess to  having time for such literature. Yet all these thousands read many books  each year, and can always find time to devour the latest popular novel.    It is chiefly a question of recreation _versus_ education. Tired and  jaded with the day's business, the young man of to-day has little  inclination to devote his leisure time to study. Light frothy literature  removes his thoughts from worldly cares, and by a complete change of  subject stimulates a mind that has been enervated by concentration for  hours on one particular theme. No effort is required, and, more important  still, _it does not make one think_.    For daily reading in the train or over meals, with this purpose always in  view, so far so good. But what of the many hours of leisure in every  man's life, when no mental recreation is needed? What does the average  man read then? It must be confessed that in nine cases out of ten his  literature remains precisely the same. Doubtless the reason is simply  because, having always been accustomed to reading the same kind of books,  he knows no other sort. Mention Shakespeare, Milton, Shelley, and he"]]]
