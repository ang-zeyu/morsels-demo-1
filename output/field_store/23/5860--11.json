Perhaps both yield to the meritorious  little work published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful  Knowledge. But a place, and an honorable place, is still left for any  one who can tell the story of Greece in a succinct and lively form,  availing himself of the light which Mr. Grote has shed upon the subject,  cultivating candor and right sympathies, cutting short the  ante-historical period, bringing strongly out the great states and the  great men, limiting himself to two moderate volumes, and addressing  himself especially to the unlearned and the young.           *       *       *       *       *    UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK.--At a recent meeting of the trustees and  faculty, the Rev.

Of NINEVEH, the mighty city of old;    The queen of all the nations. At her throne    Kings worshipp'd; and from her their subject crowns,    Humbly obedient, held; and on her state    Submiss attended; nor such servitude    Opprobrious named. From that great eminence    How, like a star, she fell, and passed away;    Such the high matter of my song shall be      The vision comes upon me! To my soul    The days of old return: I breathe the air    Of the young world: I see her giant sons.    Like to a gorgeous pageant in the sky    Of summer's evening, cloud on fiery cloud    Thronging upheaped, before me rise the walls    Of the Titanic city: brazen gates,    Towers, temples, palaces enormous piled;    Imperial NINEVEH, the earthly queen!    In all her golden pomp I see her now;    Her swarming streets; her splendid festivals;    Her sprightly damsels to the timbrel's sound    Airily bounding, and their anklets' chime;    Her lusty sons, like summer morning gay;    Her warriors stern; her rich-robed rulers grave:    I see her halls sunbright at midnight shine;    I hear the music of her banquetings;    I hear the laugh, the whisper, and the sigh.    A sound of stately treading toward me comes;    A silken wafting on the cedar floor:    As from Arabia's flowering groves, an air    Delicious breathes around. Tall, lofty browed,    Pale, and majestically beautiful;    In vesture gorgeous as the clouds of morn;    With slow proud step her glorious dames sweep by      And I look; and lo! before the walls,    Unnumbered hosts in flaming panoply;    Chariots like fire, and thunder-bearing steeds!    I hear the shouts of battle: like the waves    Of a tumultuous sea they roll and dash!    In flame and smoke the imperial city sinks!    Her walls are gone: her palaces are dust:    The desert is around her, and within:    Like shadows have the mighty passed away!      Whence and how came the ruin? By the hand    Of the oppressor were the nations bowed;    They rose against him, and prevailed: for he    The haughty monarch who the earth could rule,    By his own furious passions was o'er-ruled:    With pride his understanding was made dark,    That he the truth knew not; and, by his lusts;    The crushing burthen of his despotism;    And by the fierceness of his wrath, the hearts    Of men he turned from him. So to kings    Be he example, that the tyrannous    And iron rod breaks down at length the hand    That wields it strongest: that by virtue alone    And justice monarchs sway the hearts of men:    For there hath God implanted love of these,    And hatred of oppression; which, unseen    And noiseless though it work; yet in the end,    Even like the viewless elements of the storm,    Brooding in silence, will in thunder burst!    So let the nations learn, that not in wealth;    Nor in the grosser pleasures of the sense;    Nor in the glare of conquest; nor the pomp    Of vassal kings, and tributary lands;    Do happiness and lasting power abide:    That virtue unto man best glory is;    His strength and truest wisdom; and that vice,    Though for a season it the heart delight;    Or to worse deeds the bad man do make strong;    Brings misery yet, and terror, and remorse,    And weakness and destruction in the end.    So if the nations learn, then not in vain,    The mighty one hath been; and is no more!           *       *       *       *       *    The British Association will meet at Edinburgh, on Wednesday, the 31st  of July, under the presidency of its founder, Sir David Brewster.           *       *       *       *       *    A lover gazed on the eyes of his mistress till she blushed. He pressed  her hand to his heart and said--\"My looks have planted roses on thy  cheeks; he who sows the seed should reap the harvest.\"           *       *       *       *       *    IF I WERE A VOICE.      If I were a voice, a persuasive voice,    That could travel the wide world through.    I would fly on the beams of the morning light,    And speak to men with a gentle might,    And tell them to be true.    I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er land and sea,    Wherever a human heart might be,    Telling a tale, or singing a song,    In praise of the right--in blame of the wrong.      If I were a voice, a consoling voice,    I'd fly on the wings of air.    The homes of sorrow and guilt I'd seek,    And calm and truthful words I'd speak    To save them from despair.    I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er the crowded town,    And drop, like the happy sunlight, down    Into the hearts of suffering men,    And teach them to rejoice again.      If I were a voice, a convincing voice,    I'd travel with the wind,    And whenever I saw the nations torn    By warfare, jealousy, or scorn,    Or hatred of their kind,    I'd fly, I'd fly, on the thunder crash,    And into their blinded bosoms flash;    And, all their evil thoughts subdued,    I'd teach them Christian brotherhood.      If I were a voice, a pervading voice,    I'd seek the kings of earth;    I'd find them alone on their beds at night,    And whisper words that should guide them right--    Lessons of priceless worth;    I'd fly more swift than the swiftest bird,    And tell them things they never heard--    Truths which the ages for aye repeat--    Unknown to the statesmen at their feet.      If I were a voice, an immortal voice,    I'd speak in the people's ear;    And whenever they shouted \"_Liberty_,\"    Without deserving to be free,    I'd make their error clear.    I'd fly, I'd fly, on the wings of day,    Rebuking wrong on my world-wide way,    And making all the world rejoice--    If _I_ were a voice--an immortal voice.--_C. Mackay._          From Blackwood's Magazine.    THE GREEN HAND.    BY THE AUTHOR OF \"TOM CRINGLE'S LOG.\"      PART I.    \"Come, old ship, give us a yarn!\" said the younger forecastle-men to an  old one, on board of an Indiaman then swiftly cleaving the waves of the  western Atlantic before the trade-wind, and outward-bound, with a hearty  crew and a number of passengers. It was the second of the two  dog-watches, and the ship being still in the region of evening  twilights, her men in a good humor, and with leisure, were then usually  disposed, as on this occasion, to make fast their roaming thoughts by  help of a good yarn, when it could be got. There were plenty of  individuals, amongst a crew of forty, calculated by their experience, or  else by their flow of spirits, and fancy, to spin it. Each watch into  which they were divided had its especial story-teller, with whose merits  it twitted the other, and on opportunity of a general _reunion_, they  were pitted against one another like two fighting-cocks, or a couple of  rival novelists in more polished literary society at home. The one was a  grave, solemn old North-Sea whaler with one eye, who professed to look  down with contempt upon all raw head-work, on navigation compared with  seamanship, and fiction against fact. As for himself, he rested all his  fame upon actual experience, and told long dry narratives of old  shipmates, of his voyages and adventures, and sometimes of the most  incredible incidents, with a genuine briny gusto which pleased the  veteran stagers beyond expression. They were full of points of  seamanship--expedients for nice emergencies, tacks, knots, and splices.  He gave the very conversation of his characters, with all the \"says he\"  and \"says I;\" and one long recital of the old fellow's turned upon the  question between himself and a newfangled second mate about the right  way to set up back-stays, in which he, the sailor, was proved correct by  the loss of the ship.    The other story-teller, again, was a Wapping man; a lively, impudent  young Cockney, who had the most miraculous faculty of telling lies--not  only palpable lies, but lies absolutely impossible: yet they were so  sublimely told often, and he contrived to lug into them such a quantity  of gorgeous tinsel ornament, as, in his happier efforts, decidedly to  carry the day against his opponent. The London hand had seen _life_ too,  of which, with respect to what is called the world, his competitor was  as ignorant as a child. He had his sentimental vein, accordingly, in  which he took the last love-tale out of some \"Penny Story-Teller\" or  fashionable novel he had spelled over below, and turned it over into a  parody that would have thrown its unfortunate author into convulsions of  horror, and his critics into shrieks of laughter. The fine language of  lords and ladies, of romantic heroines, or of foreign counts and  bandits, was gravely retailed and gravely listened to by a throng of  admiring jacktars; while the old whaler smoked his pipe sulkily apart,  gave now and then a scornful glance out of his weather-eye, and called  it \"all '_high-dic_' and soger's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#13)"],[1,"ts!\" said the other scornfully. \"What facts have you given us?\"    \"The fact of the Briggerlands' history,\" said Jack desperately.  \"Briggerland was broke when he married Miss Meredith under the  impression that he would get a fortune with his wife. He has lived by  his wits all his life, and until this girl was about fifteen, they were  existing in a state of poverty. They lived in a tiny house in Ealing,  the rent of which was always in arrears, and then Briggerland became  acquainted with a rich Australian of middle age who was crazy about his  daughter. The rich Australian died suddenly.\"    \"From an overdose of veronal,\" said the chief. \"It was established at  the inquest--I got all the documents out after I received your  letter--that he was in the habit of taking veronal. You suggest he was  murdered. If he was, for what? He left the girl about six thousand  pounds.\"    \"Briggerland thought she was going to get it all,\" said Jack.    \"That is conjecture,\" interrupted the chief. \"Go on.\"    \"Briggerland moved up west,\" Jack went on, \"and when the girl was  seventeen she made the acquaintance of a man named Gunnesbury, who went  just as mad about her. Gunnesbury was a midland merchant with a wife and  family. He was so infatuated with her that he collected all the loose  money he could lay his hands on--some twenty-five thousand pounds--and  bolted to the continent. The girl was supposed to have gone on ahead,  and he was to join her at Calais. He never reached Calais. The theory  was that he jumped overboard. His body was found and brought in to  Dover, but there was none of the money in his possession that he had  drawn from the Midland Bank.\"    \"That is a theory, too,\" said the chief, shaking his head. \"The identity  of the girl was never established. It was known that she was a friend of  Gunnesbury's, but there was proof that she was in London on the night of  his death. It was a clear case of suicide.\"    \"A year later,\" Jack went on, \"she forced a meeting with Meredith, her  cousin. His father had just died--Jim had come back from Central Africa  to put things in order. He was not a woman's man, and was a grave,  retiring sort of fellow, who had no other interest in life than his  shooting. The story of Meredith you know.\"    \"And is that all?\" asked the chief politely.    \"All the facts I can gather. There must be other cases which are beyond  the power of the investigator to unearth.\"    \"And what do you expect me to do?\"    Jack smiled.    \"I don't expect you to do anything,\" he said frankly. \"You are not  exactly supporting my views with enthusiasm.\"    The chief rose, a signal that the interview was at an end.    \"I'd like to help you if you had any real need for help,\" he said. \"But  when you come to me and tell me that Miss Briggerland, a girl whose  innocence shows in her face, is a heartless criminal and murderess, and  a conspirator--why, Mr. Glover, what do you expect me to say?\"    \"I expect you to give adequate protection to Mrs. Meredith,\" said Jack  sharply. \"I expect you, sir, to remember that I've warned you that Mrs.  Meredith may die one of those accidental deaths in which Mr. and Miss  Briggerland specialise. I'm going to put my warning in black and white,  and if anything happens to Lydia Meredith, there is going to be serious  trouble on the Thames Embankment.\"    The chief touched a bell, and a constable came in.    \"Show Mr. Glover the way out,\" he said stiffly.    Jack had calmed down considerably by the time he reached the Thames  Embankment, and was inclined to be annoyed with himself for losing his  temper.    He stopped a newsboy, took a paper from his hand, and, hailing a cab,  drove to his office.    There was little in the early edition save the sporting news, but on the  front page a paragraph arrested his eye.         \"DANGEROUS LUNATIC AT LARGE.\"         \"The Medical Superintendent at Norwood Asylum reports that Dr.       Algernon John Thun, an inmate of the asylum, escaped last       night, and is believed to be at large in the neighbourhood.       Search parties have been organised, but no trace of the man has       been found. He is known to have homicidal tendencies, a fact       which renders his immediate recapture a very urgent necessity.\"    There followed a description of the wanted man. Jack turned to another  part of the paper, and dismissed the paragraph from his mind.    His partner, however, was to bring the matter up at lunch. Norwood  Asylum was near Dulwich, and Mr. Rennett was pardonably concerned.    \"The womenfolk at my house are scared to death,\" he said at lunch. \"They  won't go out at night, and they keep all the doors locked. How did your  interview with the commissioner go on?\"    \"We parted the worst of friends,\" said Jack, \"and, Rennett, the next man  who talks to me about Jean Briggerland's beautiful face is going to be  killed dead through it, even though I have to take a leaf from her book  and employ the grisly Jaggs to do it.\"          Chapter XIV      That night the \"grisly Jaggs\" was later than usual. Lydia heard him  shuffling along the passage, and presently the door of his room closed  with a click. She was sitting at the piano, and had stopped playing at  the sound of his knock, and when Mrs. Morgan came in to announce his  arrival, she closed the piano and swung round on the music stool, a look  of determination on her delicate face.    \"He's come, miss.\"    \"And for the last time,\" said Lydia ominously. \"Mrs. Morgan, I can't  stand that weird old gentleman any longer. He has got on my nerves so  that I could scream when I think of him.\"    \"He's not a bad old gentleman,\" excused Mrs. Morgan.    \"I'm not so worried about his moral character, and I dare say that it is  perfectly blameless,\" said Lydia determinedly, \"but I have written a  note to Mr. Glover to tell him that I really must dispense with his  services.\"    \"What's he here for, miss?\" asked Mrs. Morgan.    Her curiosity had been aroused, but this was the first time she had  given it expression.    \"He's here because----\" Lydia hesitated, \"well, because Mr. Glover  thinks I ought to have a man in the house to look after me.\"    \"Why, miss?\" asked the startled woman.    \"You'd better ask Mr. Glover that question,\" said Lydia grimly.    She was beginning to chafe under the sense of restraint. She was being  \"school-marmed\" she thought. No girl likes the ostentatious protection  of the big brother or the head mistress. The soul of the schoolgirl  yearns to break from the \"crocodile\" in which she is marched to church  and to school, and this sensation of being marshalled and ordered about,  and of living her life according to a third person's programme, and that  third person a man, irked her horribly.    Old Jaggs was the outward and visible sign of Jack Glover's unwarranted  authority, and slowly there was creeping into her mind a suspicion that  Jean Briggerland might not have been mistaken when she spoke of Jack's  penchant for \"ordering people about.\"    Life was growing bigger for her. She had broken down the barriers which  had confined her to a narrow promenade between office and home. The  hours which she had had to devote to work were now entirely free, and  she could sketch or paint whenever the fancy took her--which was not  very often, though she promised herself a period of hard work when once  she was settled down.    Toward the good-looking young lawyer her point of view had shifted. She  hardly knew herself how she regarded him. He irritated, and yet in some  indefinable way, pleased her. His sincerity--? She did not doubt his  sincerity. She admitted to herself that she wished he would call a  little more frequently than he did. He might have persuaded her that  Jaggs was a necessary evil, but he hadn't even taken the trouble to  come. Therefore--but this she did not admit--Jaggs must go.    \"I don't think the old gentleman's quite right in his head, you know,  sometimes,\" said Mrs. Morgan.    \"Why ever not, Mrs. Morgan?\" asked the girl in surprise.    \"I often hear him sniggering to himself as I go past his door. I suppose  he stays in his room all night, miss?\"    \"He doesn't,\" said the girl emphatically, \"and that's why he's going. I  heard him in the passage at two o'clock this morning; I'm getting into  such a state of nerves that the slightest sound awakens me. He had his  boots off and was creeping about in his stockings, and when I went out  and switched the light on he bolted back to his room. I can't have that  sort of thing going on, and I won't! it's altogether too creepy!\"    Mrs. Morgan agreed.    Lydia had not been out in the evening for several days, she remembered,  as she began to undress for the night. The weather had been unpleasant,  and to stay in the warm, comfortable flat was no great hardship. Even if  she had gone out, Jaggs would have accompanied her, she thought  ironically.    And then she had a little twinge of conscience, remembering that Jaggs's  presence on a memorable afternoon had saved her from destruction.    She wondered for the twentieth time what was old Jaggs's history, and  where Jack had found him. Once she had been tempted to ask Jaggs  himself, but the old man had fenced with the question, and had talked  vaguely of having worked in the country, and she was as wise as she had  been before.    But she must get rid of old Jaggs, she thought, as she switched off the  light and kicked out the innumerable water-bottles, with which Mrs.  Morgan, in mistaken kindness, had encumbered the bed ... old Jaggs must  go ... he was a nuisance....    She woke with a start from a dreamless sleep. The clock in the hall was  striking three. She realised this subconsciously. Her eyes were fixed on  the window, which was open at the bottom. Mrs. Morgan had pulled it  down at the top, but now it was wide open, and her heart began to thump,  thump, rapidly. Jaggs! He was her first thought. She would never have  believed that"]]]
