The young topographical engineer continued in his arduous  scientific labors, and thus contributed largely in the perfecting of  that great national scheme. It was in these military operations, and  afterwards in the surveys for roads and canals, which, under the  supervision of a Board of Internal Improvements, where confided to a  portion of the same officers, assisted by civil engineers, that Poussin  rendered himself so efficient as a practical and scientific surveyor,  and became so perfectly familiar with all the internal resources of our  extensive country, which he had thus most remarkable opportunities to  study and appreciate, by crossing it in all directions, and, in fact, by  visiting every state, and by following up and down every valley and  river of the eastern half of the continent. Few men have had such  occasion of studying _de visu_ the extent and resources of the republic;  and the intelligent readers of the volume before us will acknowledge,  that few persons have shown themselves more conversant with its  astonishing advancement. His first publication was a description of the  works to which he had contributed, under the title of \"A History of the  Internal Improvements of the United States;\" his second, an account of  all the railroads in this country, which had considerable influence in  developing in Europe a disposition toward our policy in this respect,  and entitles Major Poussin to the gratitude of all lovers of rapid and  safe communication. It was reproduced in Belgium and Germany, and has  long been a textbook upon its subject in those countries, as well as in  France. His third work was the one now translated, _La Puissance  Americaine_, in which he has displayed, most emphatically, his  admiration of our institutions, and offered them as examples to  communities aspiring after rational liberty. It may be said of it, that  it is the American system rendered popular by practical and convincing  illustrations.    Major Poussin returned to France early in 1832, in the hope to cooeperate  in rendering popular in his own country some of the political  institutions of the United States, to which he always attributed our  great prosperity; but he was not fortunate enough to be admitted to  active official life. He employed himself in his profession of surveyor,  and superintended several important public works, and frequently in  pamphlets and in contributions to the journals, labored for the  dissemination of American ideas. At last, when the Revolution of  February, 1848, broke out, he was chosen, with the greatest unanimity by  the Provisional Government, to be the Representative of Republican  France near the Government of the United States. It was deemed the  highest compliment of which France was capable, that she sent as her  minister the citizen most conversant with our affairs, and most eminent  for admiration of our institutions. His arrival in this country, and the  misunderstanding with the cabinet at Washington, which resulted in his  recall by President Bonaparte, cannot have been forgotten by the  observant reader. We believe that few who have carefully studied the  conduct of Major Poussin in that affair, will be disposed, in the  slightest degree, to censure him, while the entire history will readily  be consigned to oblivion by the American who is in any degree sensitive  upon the subject of our national honor.           *       *       *       *       *    GUILLAUMIN ET CIE, the well known Parisian publishers, are about to add  to their _Collection des Principaux Economistes_ several American works  in this department. One volume, at least, will be devoted to Henry C.  Carey's masterly compositions, with a preface and commentaries; another  volume will be given to the Free Trade party, and will embrace the best  things of Mr. Walker, Mr. Raguet, Mr. Cardozo, Henry Middleton, Dr.  Wayland, &c.; and essays by Mr. Phillips, Horace Greeley, and other  Protectionists, will probably constitute another. The _Collection_ now  embraces Quesnay, Turgot, Dupont Nemours, Le Tronne, the Says, Galliani,  de Montyon, Condillac, Lavoisier, Adam Smith, Hume, Ricardo, Malthus,  Bentham, and a dozen more. The only American name in the list is that of  Franklin quoted in the first volume of the _Melanges_, edited by Daire  and Molinari.           *       *       *       *       *    JOSEPH GALES, of the _National Intelligencer_, has lately published  several leading articles of such compactness and completeness, such  weight and dignity, as distinguish only the greatest compositions in  philosophy and upon affairs. The intellectual force acting through the  press of this country is habitually underrated. There are a dozen  journals here which may be advantageously compared with any in Europe,  with the single exception of the _Times_. It would perhaps seem  invidious to point them out, from the greater number that are conducted  with ability and energy; but it will not be objected by any one who has  the right to express an opinion in the case, if we say that Mr. Gales is  of the first rank of public men who have ever influenced or illustrated  the course of events by written eloquence or argument. The leading  articles from his hand which in the last twenty-five years have appeared  in the National Intelligencer, would fill many volumes; and if collected  and so submitted to one view, they would astonish by their variety, by  the extraordinary resources of information which they evince, by their  soundness of logic, elevation of sentiment, and uniform adaptation to  their several purposes. If they lack the pungent wit, and fiery energy  of phrase, and adroitly venomous spirit of \"Junius,\" they have, with  their nobler calmness and uniform candor, a far wider sweep, a subtler  apprehension of consequences, and a more statesmanlike aim and capacity.  The diction of \"Junius\" was calculated to arrest attention, by its  glitter and strength, and by its freshness; for it was in style, after  all, that he was most creative, and since his style has by imitation  become familiar, it is for the mystery of their authorship only that his  works have continued eminence. As materials for history, and as  suggestive guides of policy, we have in American literature very few  works so important as the leading articles of Joseph Gales would  constitute, fitly arranged, and illustrated by such notes as he could  readily furnish, necessary now on account of the time since some of them  were originally printed.           *       *       *       *       *    The REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER'S \"Whale and his Captors,\" (published last  year by the Harpers,) has been reprinted in London under the title of  \"The Whaleman's Adventures in the Northern Ocean,\" with a highly and  justly commendatory introduction by the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D. F.R.S. We  have great pleasure in recording evidences of the popularity of such  works as Mr. Cheever's. They have a manly as well as a Christian spirit,  and are needed to counteract the influences of the many infidel books in  which the effects of the Christian civilization in the Island World are  systematically misrepresented. We learn that Mr. Cheever is now engaged  upon \"The Autobiography of Captain Obadiah Conger,\" who was fifty years  a mariner from the port of New-York. He is editing the MS. of the  deceased sailor for the Harpers.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. JOB R. TYSON, whose careful researches respecting the colonial  history of Pennsylvania have illustrated his abilities and his  predilections in this line, is about to proceed to Europe, for the  consultation of certain documents connected with the subject,  preparatory to the publication of his \"History of the American  Colonies,\" a work in which, doubtless, he will not be liable to the  reproach of histories written by New-Englanders, that they exaggerate  the virtues and the influence of the Puritans. Mr. Tyson is of the best  stock of the Philadelphia Quakers, and the traditional fame of his party  will not suffer in his hands.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. HENRY JAMES, the author of \"Moralism and Christianity,\" must  certainly be regarded by all who come into his fit audience as one of  the greatest living masters of metaphysics. Mr. James has never been  mentioned in the _North American Review_; but then, that peculiarly  national work has not in all its seventy volumes an article upon  Jonathan Edwards, whom Robert Hall, Dr. Chalmers, Dugald Stuart, Sir  James Mackintosh, Kant, Cousin, and a hundred others scarcely less  famous, have regarded as the chief glory in our intellectual firmament;  it has never let its light shine upon the pages of Legare; it has  preserved the most profound silence respecting Henry Carey, William R.  Williams, and Addison Alexander; so that it must not be considered  altogether conclusive as to Mr. James's merits that he has not had the  seal of the _North American's_ approval. We regard him as one of the  great metaphysicians of the time, not because, like Comte, he has  evolved with irresistible power and majestic order any grand and  complete system, but because he has brought to the discussion of the few  questions he has attempted, so independent a spirit, so pure a method,  such expansive humanity, and such ample resources of learning, as  separately claim admiration, and combined, constitute a teacher of the  most dignified rank, who can and will influence the world. We do not  altogether agree with Mr. James; on the contrary, we have been regarded  as particularly grim in our conservatism; but we are none the less  sensible of Mr. James's surpassing merits as a writer upon the  philosophy of society.

(#13)"],[1,"domestic  animals.[115] If our domestic breeds have descended from several {52}  species or natural races, these apparently have all become extinct in the  wild state. With our present knowledge, the common view that all have  descended from a single species is, perhaps, the most probable.    With respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have  undergone, the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable direct  effect. Mr. D. Forbes, who has had excellent opportunities of comparing the  horses of Spain with those of South America, informs me that the horses of  Chile, which have lived under nearly the same conditions as their  progenitors in Andalusia, remain unaltered, whilst the Pampas horses and  the Puno ponies are considerably modified. There can be no doubt that  horses become greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living  on mountains and islands; and this apparently is due to want of nutritious  or varied food. Every one knows how small and rugged the ponies are on the  Northern islands and on the mountains of Europe. Corsica and Sardinia have  their native ponies; and there were,[116] or still are, on some islands on  the coast of Virginia, ponies like those of the Shetland Islands, which are  believed to have originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions.  The Puno ponies, which inhabit the lofty regions of the Cordillera, are, as  I hear from Mr. D. Forbes, strange little creatures, very unlike their  Spanish progenitors. Further south, in the Falkland Islands, the offspring  of the horses imported in 1764 have already so much deteriorated in  size[117] and strength that they are unfitted for catching wild cattle with  the lasso; so that fresh horses have to be brought for this purpose from La  Plata at a great expense. The reduced size of the horses bred on both  southern and northern islands, and on several mountain-chains, can hardly  have been caused by the cold, as a similar reduction has occurred on the  Virginian and Mediterranean islands. The horse can withstand intense cold,  for wild troops live on the plains of Siberia under lat. 56 deg.,[118] and  aboriginally the horse must {53} have inhabited countries annually covered  with snow, for he long retains the instinct of scraping it away to get at  the herbage beneath. The wild tarpans in the East have this instinct; and,  as I am informed by Admiral Sulivan, this is likewise the case with the  horses which have run wild on the Falkland Islands; now this is the more  remarkable as the progenitors of these horses could not have followed this  instinct during many generations in La Plata: the wild cattle of the  Falklands never scrape away the snow, and perish when the ground is long  covered. In the northern parts of America the horses, descended from those  introduced by the Spanish conquerors of Mexico, have the same habit, as  have the native bisons, but not so the cattle introduced from Europe.[119]    The horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense cold,  for he is known to come to the highest perfection, though not attaining a  large size, in Arabia and northern Africa. Much humidity is apparently more  injurious to the horse than heat or cold. In the Falkland Islands, horses  suffer much from the dampness; and this same circumstance may perhaps  partly account for the singular fact that to the eastward of the Bay of  Bengal,[120] over an enormous and humid area, in Ava, Pegu, Siam, the  Malayan archipelago, the Loo Choo Islands, and a large part of China, no  full-sized horse is found. When we advance as far eastward as Japan, the  horse reacquires his full size.[121]    With most of our domesticated animals, some breeds are kept on account of  their curiosity or beauty; but the horse is valued almost solely for its  utility. Hence semi-monstrous breeds are not preserved; and probably all  the existing breeds have been slowly formed either by the direct action of  the conditions of life, or through the selection of individual differences.  No doubt semi-monstrous breeds might have been formed: thus Mr. Waterton  records[122] the case of a mare which produced {54} successively three  foals without tails; so that a tailless race might have been formed like  the tailless races of dogs and cats. A Russian breed of horses is said to  have frizzled hair, and Azara[123] relates that in Paraguay horses are  occasionally born, but are generally destroyed, with hair like that on the  head of a negro; and this peculiarity is transmitted even to half-breeds:  it is a curious case of correlation that such horses have short manes and  tails, and their hoofs are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule.    It is scarcely possible to doubt that the long-continued selection of  qualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the formation of  the several breeds of the horse. Look at a dray-horse, and see how well  adapted he is to draw heavy weights, and how unlike in appearance to any  allied wild animal. The English race-horse is known to have proceeded from  the commingled blood of Arabs, Turks, and Barbs; but selection and training  have together made him a very different animal from his parent-stocks. As a  writer in India, who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now,  \"looking at our present breed of race-horses, could have conceived that  they were the result of the union of the Arab horse and African mare?\" The  improvement is so marked that in running for the Goodwood Cup \"the first  descendants of Arabian, Turkish, and Persian horses, are allowed a discount  of 18 lbs. weight; and when both parents are of these countries a discount  of 36 lbs.\"[124] It is notorious that the Arabs have long been as careful  about the pedigree of their horses as we are, and this implies great and  continued care in breeding. Seeing what has been done in England by careful  breeding, can we doubt that the Arabs must likewise have produced during  the course of centuries a marked effect on the qualities of their horses?  But we may go much farther back in time, for in the most ancient known  book, the Bible, we hear of studs carefully kept for breeding, {55} and of  horses imported at high prices from various countries.[125] We may  therefore conclude that, whether or not the various existing breeds of the  horse have proceeded from one or more aboriginal stocks, yet that a great  amount of change has resulted from the direct action of the conditions of  life, and probably a still greater amount from the long-continued selection  by man of slight individual differences.    With several domesticated quadrupeds and birds, certain coloured marks are  either strongly inherited or tend to reappear after having long been lost.  As this subject will hereafter be seen to be of importance, I will give a  full account of the colouring of horses. All English breeds, however unlike  in size and appearance, and several of those in India and the Malay  archipelago, present a similar range and diversity of colour. The English  race-horse, however, is said[126] never to be dun-coloured; but as dun and  cream-coloured horses are considered by the Arabs as worthless, \"and fit  only for Jews to ride,\"[127] these tints may have been removed by  long-continued selection. Horses of every colour, and of such widely  different kinds as dray-horses, cobs, and ponies, are all occasionally  dappled,[128] in the same manner as is so conspicuous with grey horses.  This fact does not throw any clear light on the colouring of the aboriginal  horse, but is a case of analogous variation, for even asses are sometimes  dappled, and I have seen, in the British Museum, a hybrid from the ass and  zebra dappled on its hinder quarters. By the expression analogous variation  (and it is one that I shall often have occasion to use) I mean a variation  occurring in a species or variety which resembles a normal character in  another and distinct species or variety. Analogous variations may arise, as  will be explained in a future chapter, {56} from two or more forms with a  similar constitution having been exposed to similar conditions,--or from  one of two forms having reacquired through reversion a character inherited  by the other form from their common progenitor,--or from both forms having  reverted to the same ancestral character. We shall immediately see that  horses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over a large part  of their bodies; and as we know that stripes readily pass into spots and  cloudy marks in the varieties of the domestic cat and in several feline  species--even the cubs of the uniformly-coloured lion being spotted with  dark marks on a lighter ground--we may suspect that the dappling of the  horse, which has been noticed by some authors with surprise, is a  modification or vestige of a tendency to become striped.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Dun Devonshire Pony, with shoulder, spinal, and leg  stripes.]        This tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects an      interesting feet. Horses of all colours, of the most diverse breeds, in      various parts of the world, often have a dark stripe extending along      the spine, from the mane to the tail; but this is so common that I need      enter into no particulars.[129] Occasionally horses are transversely      barred on the legs, chiefly on the under side; and more rarely they      have a distinct stripe on the shoulder, like that on the shoulder of      the ass, or a broad dark patch representing a stripe. Before entering      on any details I must premise that {57} the term dun-coloured is vague,      and includes three groups of colour, viz. that between cream-colour and      reddish-brown, which graduates into light-bay or light-chesnut--this, I      believe, is often called fallow-dun; secondly, leaden or slate-colour      or mouse-dun, which graduates into an ash-colour; and, lastly,      dark-dun, between"]]]
