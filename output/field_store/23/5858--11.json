[Illustration: THE TOWN WATCHMAN.]    In Hartford people had to get up when the town watchman rang his bell.  The affairs of the family, and private matters too numerous to mention,  were regulated by the selectmen. The catalogues of Harvard and Yale were  regulated according to the standing of the family as per record in the  old country, and not as per bust measurement and merit, as it is to-day.    Scolding women, however, were gagged and tied to their front doors, so  that the populace could bite its thumb at them, and hired girls received  fifty dollars a year, with the understanding that they were not to have  over two days out each week, except Sunday and the days they had to go  and see their \"sick sisters.\"    Some cloth-weaving was indulged in, and homespun was the principal  material used for clothing. Mrs. Washington had sixteen spinning-wheels  in her house. Her husband often wore homespun while at home, and on  rainy days sometimes placed a pair of home-made trousers of the  barn-door variety in the Presidential chair.    Money was very scarce, and ammunition very valuable. In 1635  musket-balls passed for farthings, and to see a New England peasant  making change with the red brother at thirty yards was a common and  delightful scene.    The first press was set up in Cambridge in 1639, with the statement that  it \"had come to stay.\" Books printed in those days were mostly sermons  filled with the most comfortable assurance that the man who let loose  his intellect and allowed it to disbelieve some very difficult things  would be essentially----well, I hate to say right here in a book what  would happen to him.    [Illustration: BOOKS FILLED WITH ASSURANCES OF FUTURE DAMNATION.]    The first daily paper, called _The Federal Orrery_, was issued three  hundred years after Columbus discovered America. It was not popular,  and killed off the news-boys who tried to call it on the streets: so it  perished.    There was a public library in New York, from which books were loaned at  fourpence ha'penny per week. New York thus became very early the seat of  learning, and soon afterwards began to abuse the site where Chicago now  stands.    Travel was slow, the people went on horseback or afoot, and when they  could go by boat it was regarded as a success. Wagons finally made the  trip from New York to Philadelphia in the wild time of forty-eight  hours, and the line was called The Flying Dutchman, or some other  euphonious name. Benjamin Franklin, whose biography occurs in Chapter  XV., was then Postmaster-General.    He was the first bald-headed man of any prominence in the history of  America. He and his daughter Sally took a trip in a chaise, looking over  the entire system, and going to all offices. Nothing pleased the  Postmaster-General like quietly slipping into a place like Sandy Bottom  and catching the postmaster reading over the postal cards and committing  them to memory.    Calfskin shoes up to the Revolution were the exclusive property of the  gentry, and the rest wore cowhide and were extremely glad to mend them  themselves. These were greased every week with tallow, and could be worn  on either foot with impunity. Rights and lefts were never thought of  until after the Revolutionary War, but to-day the American shoe is the  most symmetrical, comfortable, and satisfactory shoe made in the world.  The British shoe is said to be more comfortable. Possibly for a British  foot it is so, but for a foot containing no breathing-apparatus or  viscera it is somewhat roomy and clumsy.    [Illustration: CAUGHT BY FRANKLIN READING POSTAL CARDS.]    Farmers and laborers of those days wore green or red baize in the shape  of jackets, and their breeches were made of leather or bed-ticking. Our  ancestors dressed plainly, and a man who could not make over two  hundred pounds per year was prohibited from dressing up or wearing lace  worth over two shillings per yard. It was a pretty sad time for literary  men, as they were thus compelled to wear clothing like the common  laborers.    Lord Cornwallis once asked his aidy kong why the American poet always  had such an air of listening as if for some expected sound. \"I give it  up,\" retorted the aidy kong. \"It is,\" said Lord Cornwallis, as he took a  large drink from a jug which he had tied to his saddle, \"because he is  trying to see if he cannot hear his bed-ticking.\" On the following day  he surrendered his army, and went home to spring his _bon-mot_ on George  III.    Yet the laws were very stringent in other respects besides apparel. A  man was publicly whipped for killing a fowl on the Sabbath in New  England. In order to keep a tavern and sell rum, one had to be of good  moral character and possess property, which was a good thing. The names  of drunkards were posted up in the alehouses, and the keepers forbidden  to sell them liquor. No person under twenty years of age could use  tobacco in Connecticut without a physician's order, and no one was  allowed to use it more than once a day, and then not within ten miles of  any house. It was a common thing to see large picnic-parties going out  into the backwoods of Connecticut to smoke.    (Will the reader excuse me a moment while I light up a peculiarly black  and redolent pipe?)    [Illustration: LORD CORNWALLIS'S CONUNDRUM.]    Only the gentry were called Mr. and Mrs. This included the preacher and  his wife. A friend of mine who is one of the gentry of this century got  on the trail of his ancestry last spring, and traced them back to where  they were not allowed to be called Mr. and Mrs., and, fearing he would  fetch up in Scotland Yard if he kept on, he slowly unrolled the bottoms  of his trousers, got a job on the railroad, and since then his friends  are gradually returning to him. He is well pleased now, and looks  humbly gratified even if you call him a gent.    The Scriptures were literally interpreted, and the Old Testament was  read every morning, even if the ladies fainted.    The custom yet noticed sometimes in country churches and festive  gatherings of placing the males and females on opposite sides of the  room was originated not so much as a punishment to both, as to give the  men an opportunity to act together when the red brother felt ill at  ease.    I am glad the red brother does not molest us nowadays, and make us sit  apart that way. Keep away, red brother; remain on your reservation,  please, so that the pale-face may sit by the loved one and hold her  little soft hand during the sermon.    Church services meant business in those days. People brought their  dinners and had a general penitential gorge. Instrumental music was  proscribed, as per Amos fifth chapter and twenty-third verse, and the  length of prayer was measured by the physical endurance of the  performer.    The preacher often boiled his sermon down to four hours, and the sexton  up-ended the hourglass each hour. Boys who went to sleep in church were  sand-bagged, and grew up to be border murderers.    New York people were essentially Dutch. New York gets her Santa Claus,  her doughnuts, crullers, cookies, and many of her odors, from the Dutch.  The New York matron ran to fine linen and a polished door-knocker, while  the New England housewife spun linsey-woolsey and knit \"yarn mittens\"  for those she loved.    Philadelphia was the largest city in the United States, and was noted  for its cleanliness and generally sterling qualities of mind and heart,  its Sabbath trance and clean white door-steps.    The Southern Colonies were quite different from those of the North. In  place of thickly-settled towns there were large plantations with African  villages near the house of the owner. The proprietor was a sort of  country squire, living in considerable comfort for those days. He fed  and clothed everybody, black or white, who lived on the estate, and  waited patiently for the colored people to do his work and keep well, so  that they would be more valuable. The colored people were blessed with  children at a great rate, so that at this writing, though voteless, they  send a large number of members to Congress. This cheers the Southern  heart and partially recoups him for his chickens. (See Appendix.)    The South then, as now, cured immense quantities of tobacco, while the  North tried to cure those who used it.    Washington was a Virginian. He packed his own flour with his own hands,  and it was never inspected. People who knew him said that the only man  who ever tried to inspect Washington's flour was buried under a hill of  choice watermelons at Mount Vernon.    Along the James and Rappahannock the vast estates often passed from  father to son according to the law of entail, and such a thing as a poor  man \"prior to the war\" must have been unknown.    [Illustration: NOT RICH BEFORE THE WAR.]    Education, however, flourished more at the North, owing partly to the  fact that the people lived more in communities. Governor Berkeley of  Virginia was opposed to free schools from the start, and said, \"I thank  God there are no free schools nor printing-presses here, and I hope we  shall not have them these hundred years.\" His prayer has been answered.          CHAPTER XIV.    THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.      William Pitt was partly to blame for the Revolutionary War. He claimed  that the Colonists ought not to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail  except by permission of Parliament.    It was already hard enough to be a colonist, without the privilege of  expressing one's self even to an Indian without being fined. But when we  pause to think that England seemed to demand that the colonist should  take the long wet walk to Liverpool during a busy season of the year to  get his horse shod, we say at once that P. Henry was right when he  exclaimed that the war was inevitable and moved that permission be  granted for it to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#13)"],[1,"the riders, that were so wonderful; it was the question put by  the man who rode foremost of the three.    The approach to Jerusalem from the north is across a plain which  dips southward, leaving the Damascus Gate in a vale or hollow.  The road is narrow, but deeply cut by long use, and in places  difficult on account of the cobbles left loose and dry by the  washing of the rains. On either side, however, there stretched,  in the old time, rich fields and handsome olive-groves, which must,  in luxurious growth, have been beautiful, especially to travellers  fresh from the wastes of the desert. In this road, the three stopped  before the party in front of the Tombs.    \"Good people,\" said Balthasar, stroking his plaited beard,  and bending from his cot, \"is not Jerusalem close by?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the woman into whose arms the child had shrunk.  \"If the trees on yon swell were a little lower you could see the  towers on the market-place.\"    Balthasar gave the Greek and the Hindoo a look, then asked,    \"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?\"    The women gazed at each other without reply.    \"You have not heard of him?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, tell everybody that we have seen his star in the east,  and are come to worship him.\"    Thereupon the friends rode on. Of others they asked the same  question, with like result. A large company whom they met going to  the Grotto of Jeremiah were so astonished by the inquiry and the  appearance of the travellers that they turned about and followed  them into the city.    So much were the three occupied with the idea of their mission that  they did not care for the view which presently rose before them in  the utmost magnificence: for the village first to receive them  on Bezetha; for Mizpah and Olivet, over on their left; for the  wall behind the village, with its forty tall and solid towers,  superadded partly for strength, partly to gratify the critical  taste of the kingly builder; for the same towered wall bending  off to the right, with many an angle, and here and there an  embattled gate, up to the three great white piles Phasaelus,  Mariamne, and Hippicus; for Zion, tallest of the hills, crowned  with marble palaces, and never so beautiful; for the glittering  terraces of the temple on Moriah, admittedly one of the wonders  of the earth; for the regal mountains rimming the sacred city round  about until it seemed in the hollow of a mighty bowl.    They came, at length, to a tower of great height and strength,  overlooking the gate which, at that time, answered to the  present Damascus Gate, and marked the meeting-place of the  three roads from Shechem, Jericho, and Gibeon. A Roman guard  kept the passage-way. By this time the people following the  camels formed a train sufficient to draw the idlers hanging  about the portal; so that when Balthasar stopped to speak to  the sentinel, the three became instantly the centre of a close  circle eager to hear all that passed.    \"I give you peace,\" the Egyptian said, in a clear voice.    The sentinel made no reply.    \"We have come great distances in search of one who is born King  of the Jews. Can you tell us where he is?\"    The soldier raised the visor of his helmet, and called loudly.  From an apartment at the right of the passage an officer appeared.    \"Give way,\" he cried, to the crowd which now pressed closer in; and as  they seemed slow to obey, he advanced twirling his javelin vigorously,  now right, now left; and so he gained room.    \"What would you?\" he asked of Balthasar, speaking in the idiom of  the city.    And Balthasar answered in the same,    \"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?\"    \"Herod?\" asked the officer, confounded.    \"Herod's kingship is from Caesar; not Herod.\"    \"There is no other King of the Jews.\"    \"But we have seen the star of him we seek, and come to worship him.\"    The Roman was perplexed.    \"Go farther,\" he said, at last. \"Go farther. I am not a Jew.  Carry the question to the doctors in the Temple, or to Hannas  the priest, or, better still, to Herod himself. If there be  another King of the Jews, he will find him.\"    Thereupon he made way for the strangers, and they passed the gate.  But, before entering the narrow street, Balthasar lingered to say  to his friends, \"We are sufficiently proclaimed. By midnight the  whole city will have heard of us and of our mission. Let us to  the khan now.\"          CHAPTER XIII      That evening, before sunset, some women were washing clothes on  the upper step of the flight that led down into the basin of the  Pool of Siloam. They knelt each before a broad bowl of earthenware.  A girl at the foot of the steps kept them supplied with water, and  sang while she filled the jar. The song was cheerful, and no doubt  lightened their labor. Occasionally they would sit upon their heels,  and look up the slope of Ophel, and round to the summit of what is  now the Mount of Offence, then faintly glorified by the dying sun.    While they plied their hands, rubbing and wringing the clothes  in the bowls, two other women came to them, each with an empty  jar upon her shoulder.    \"Peace to you,\" one of the new-comers said.    The laborers paused, sat up, wrung the water from their hands,  and returned the salutation.    \"It is nearly night--time to quit.\"    \"There is no end to work,\" was the reply.    \"But there is a time to rest, and--\"    \"To hear what may be passing,\" interposed another.    \"What news have you?\"    \"Then you have not heard?\"    \"No.\"    \"They say the Christ is born,\" said the newsmonger, plunging into  her story.    It was curious to see the faces of the laborers brighten with  interest; on the other side down came the jars, which, in a  moment, were turned into seats for their owners.    \"The Christ!\" the listeners cried.    \"So they say.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Everybody; it is common talk.\"    \"Does anybody believe it?\"    \"This afternoon three men came across Brook Cedron on the road  from Shechem,\" the speaker replied, circumstantially, intending  to smother doubt. \"Each one of them rode a camel spotless white,  and larger than any ever before seen in Jerusalem.\"    The eyes and mouths of the auditors opened wide.    \"To prove how great and rich the men were,\" the narrator continued,  \"they sat under awnings of silk; the buckles of their saddles were  of gold, as was the fringe of their bridles; the bells were of  silver, and made real music. Nobody knew them; they looked as if  they had come from the ends of the world. Only one of them spoke,  and of everybody on the road, even the women and children, he asked  this question--'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?' No one  gave them answer--no one understood what they meant; so they passed  on, leaving behind them this saying: 'For we have seen his star in  the east, and are come to worship him.' They put the question to  the Roman at the gate; and he, no wiser than the simple people on  the road, sent them up to Herod.\"    \"Where are they now?\"    \"At the khan. Hundreds have been to look at them already, and hundreds  more are going.\"    \"Who are they?\"    \"Nobody knows. They are said to be Persians--wise men who talk  with the stars--prophets, it may be, like Elijah and Jeremiah.\"    \"What do they mean by King of the Jews?\"    \"The Christ, and that he is just born.\"    One of the women laughed, and resumed her work, saying, \"Well,  when I see him I will believe.\"    Another followed her example: \"And I--well, when I see him raise  the dead, I will believe.\"    A third said, quietly, \"He has been a long time promised. It will  be enough for me to see him heal one leper.\"    And the party sat talking until the night came, and, with the help  of the frosty air, drove them home.    * * * * * *    Later in the evening, about the beginning of the first watch,  there was an assemblage in the palace on Mount Zion, of probably  fifty persons, who never came together except by order of Herod,  and then only when he had demanded to know some one or more of the  deeper mysteries of the Jewish law and history. It was, in short,  a meeting of the teachers of the colleges, of the chief priests,  and of the doctors most noted in the city for learning--the leaders of  opinion, expounders of the different creeds; princes of the Sadducees;  Pharisaic debaters; calm, soft-spoken, stoical philosophers of the  Essene socialists.    The chamber in which the session was held belonged to one of  the interior court-yards of the palace, and was quite large  and Romanesque. The floor was tessellated with marble blocks;  the walls, unbroken by a window, were frescoed in panels of  saffron yellow; a divan occupied the centre of the apartment,  covered with cushions of bright-yellow cloth, and fashioned in  form of the letter U, the opening towards the doorway; in the  arch of the divan, or, as it were, in the bend of the letter,  there was an immense bronze tripod, curiously inlaid with gold  and silver, over which a chandelier dropped from the ceiling,  having seven arms, each holding a lighted lamp. The divan and  the lamp were purely Jewish.    The company sat upon the divan after the style of Orientals,  in costume singularly uniform, except as to color. They were  mostly men advanced in years; immense beards covered their faces;  to their large noses were added the effects of large black eyes,  deeply shaded by bold brows; their demeanor was grave, dignified,  even patriarchal. In brief, their session was that of the Sanhedrim.    He who sat before the tripod, however, in the place which may  be called the head of the divan, having all the rest of his  associates on his right and left, and, at the same time, before him,  evidently president of the meeting, would have instantly absorbed  the attention of a spectator. He had been cast in large mould,  but was now shrunken and stooped to ghastliness; his white robe  dropped from his shoulders in folds that gave no hint of muscle  or anything"]]]
