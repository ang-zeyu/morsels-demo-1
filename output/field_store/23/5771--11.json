In front of the rectangular room  and on the edge of the bench, which is here but a few feet above the  talus, a rather heavy wall has been built over the top of a rock, and  inside or to the north of it another wall has been placed, hardly 2 feet  distant. These walls are connected at the eastern end by a thin cross  wall, now but slightly above the ground surface and notched like a  doorway. Below the notch a slab of stone has been placed and was  apparently used as a step. The purpose of these walls is not clear, but  they may have constituted an entrance or passageway to the village. If  so, we have here a very efficient defensive expedient and a decided  anomaly in cliff-village architecture.    At the point marked 31 on the map there is a small ruin on a ledge about  150 feet above the bottom and difficult of access. The site overlooks  considerable areas of bottom land on both sides of the canyon, and was  probably connected with and formed part of a larger ruin on the same  ledge and east of it, which will next be described. On this site there  are remains of half a dozen rooms or more and of one circular kiva,  which was 20 feet in diameter. (See ground plan, figure 20.) The site  has been much filled up, and the kiva appears as a cylindrical  depression, flush with the ground outside, but 3 to 5 feet deep inside.  The walls are rather thin and smoothly plastered inside. On the south  side there is an opening extending down to the floor level and opening  directly on the sharply sloping rock. This feature will later be  discussed at some length. The walls to the west of the kiva are still 14  or 15 feet high, showing two stories, and were well constructed and  smoothly plastered. The interior of the kiva shows a number of  successive coats of plastering--at least eight.      [Illustration: Fig. 21--Ground plan of ruin No. 32, Canyon de    Chelly.]    Immediately above the last-mentioned ruin, and on the same ledge, occur  the remains of a large settlement, shown in plan in figure 21. It will  be noticed that here, as in some of the previous examples described, the  general arrangement consists of a row of rooms against the cliff, with  the kivas in front. There were at least 17 rooms in line, and there  may have been as many as 30 to 50 rectangular rooms in the village,  scattered over an area nearly 200 feet long by 65 feet wide, but not all  of this area was covered. Three kivas are still clearly shown.    This ruin is especially interesting on account of the site it occupies.  The walls were placed on sharply sloping rock and in some cases on  loose debris, and numerous expedients were resorted to to prevent them  from slipping down the slope. The fact that these expedients were not  successful makes them more interesting. Upright logs were inclosed in  the walls and anchored in holes drilled in the rock below; horizontal  logs were built into the masonry as ties and placed below it, and heavy  retaining walls were erected. These constructive expedients will later  be discussed at greater length.    The whole slope is more or less covered with debris, and there is no  doubt that this was at one time a considerable settlement. The cliff  walls near the east end show traces of two stories, and in one place of  three stories, which formerly rested against them. Moreover, the number  of successive coats of plaster in the kiva shows an extended occupancy,  an inference which is further supported by the variety of expedients  which were adopted to hold the walls in place.    The marked irregularity of the five eastern rooms as compared with the  regular series west of them will be noticed on the plan. These eastern  rooms must have been added at a period subsequent to the completion of  the others. The marks of a second and third story occur on the cliff  back of this cluster, and there is no doubt that it was an important  part of the settlement. West of the area shown on the plan traces of  walls occur on the slope and among the debris for a distance of over 100  feet.    Parts of three kivas can now be seen on the ground, and this was  probably the total number in the settlement. The fronts of all of them  have fallen out, notwithstanding various expedients that were employed  to hold them in place. The western wall of the western kiva is part of  the rectangular system and was apparently in place before the kiva was  built. A triangular block which formed the junction in front of this  kiva and the central one has slipped down and new walls were afterward  built to restore the kivas to their original shape. The central kiva has  an interior bench, which was, however, added after the structure was  completed, and in fact after the front had been replaced. The second  falling off of the front has left a fine section of the wall, and the  changes which have taken place are plainly shown in it.    That the interior bench was added long after the original kiva had been  completed and occupied is shown by the occurrence between it and the  wall of nearly an inch of plaster composed of separate coatings, each  smoke-blackened, varying from the thickness of a piece of heavy paper  up to an eighth of an inch or more. If one of these coatings were added  each year, twelve or fifteen years at least must have elapsed between  the building of the kiva and the construction of the interior bench. The  original floor of the kiva was composed of a layer of mud mortar about  an inch thick, and extends through under the bench, the top of which is  about 3 feet above it; Under this floor there is a straight wall at  right angles to the cliff and extending some 4 feet toward the center of  the kiva; what is left of it is just under the floor level.    There is a suggestion in this that the site of the kiva was originally  occupied by rectangular rooms, and there is a further suggestion, in the  end sections referred to, that the kiva had at some period fallen into  decay and was subsequently rebuilt. All this occurred before the first  falling out of the front.    The section shows that the original walls were not so thick as the  present ones, and that there was formerly a slight setback in the wall  of 21/2 or 3 inches at the level of the present bench, reducing the  thickness of the wall by that amount. The original outside wall on the  east extends only 6 inches above this setback. The upper portion of the  exterior wall was added at the same time that the bench was constructed  and is the same thickness as the lower part of the original wall. Figure  22 will make clear the changes which have taken place.    There was a recess of some kind in the original wall on the east and a  similar one on the west side, but they have been filled up by the later  additions. The upright logs which were built into the masonry are  incorporated in the older walls. Under the floor, and apparently under  the walls themselves, there is a layer nearly a foot thick of loose  debris consisting of cornstalks, corn leaves, ashes, and loose dirt.  The floor of the east circular room, which still covers about half the  interior, rests similarly on a layer of ashes. The expedients employed  to hold the front walls of these kivas in place are later discussed at  some length.      [Illustration: Fig. 22--Section of a kiva wall.]    Figure 23 shows the character of site occupied by a village ruin of some  size situated in the first cove in the cliff wall below the mouth of  Canyon del Muerto. The cliff here is about 300 feet high and the ruin  is located on a ledge in a cove about 70 feet above the stream bed.  Although seemingly very difficult to reach, the ruin is of comparatively  easy access without artificial aid. The cavity was caused apparently by  the occurrence of a pocket of material softer than that about it, and  this softer material has weathered out, showing very strongly the lines  of cross bedding, which, in the massive rock on either side, have been  almost entirely obliterated. The strata are inclined at an angle and the  edges project from a few inches to about a foot, forming a series of  little benches tilted up at an angle of about 45 degrees. By the  exercise of some agility, one can ascend along these benches. About  halfway between the site of the ruin and the stream bed there is a  narrow horizontal bench, and again halfway between this bench and the  ruin there is another, about 55 feet above the stream. Access to the  ruins is greatly facilitated by these intermediate ledges.    The bench on which the ruin occurs is about 250 feet long and generally  about 20 feet wide, the surface being almost flat. There are structures  on the extreme northern and on the extreme southern ends, but a  considerable part of the intermediate area was not occupied. Reference  to the ground plan (figure 24) will show that most of the buildings  occur on the northern half of the ledge, which was fairly well filled by  them. Many of the walls in this portion are apparently underlaid by a  foot or more of ashes, sheep dung, domestic refuse, cornhusks, etc.      [Illustration: Fig. 23--Ruin No. 10 on a ledge in a cove.]    The room which is shown in the center of the plan, at the southern end  of the main group, stood alone and was the largest rectangular room in  the village. It covered an area 15 feet by 9 feet inside the walls,  which are now 5 or 6 feet high. The masonry is very good, although  chinking with spalls was but slightly employed to finish the exterior;  inside it is more apparent. The western wall was built over the edge of  the sloping rock forming the back of the cove, as shown on the plan, and  this rock projects below the wall into the room. There were apparently  no openings in the walls, except some very small ones on the eastern  side, near the floor level. In the southern wall a piece of rough timber  was inlaid in the masonry, about 5 feet above"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#13)"],[1,"ly.    She said in her lilting voice, \"Take care not to sever the tendons, or  his hands would be paralyzed and he may claim we have broken our  compact.\"    The points of the steel, razor-sharp, touched my palms, and I felt blood  run down my hand before the pain. With an effort that turned my face  white, I did not pull away from the point. The knives drove deeper.    Dallisa gestured to the _chak_. The knives dropped. Two pinpricks, a  quarter of an inch deep, stung in my palm. I had outbluffed her. Had I?    If I had expected her to betray disappointment--and I had--I was  disappointed. Abruptly, as if the game had wearied her already, she  gestured, and I could not hold back a gasp as my arms were hauled up  over my head, twisted violently around one another and trussed with thin  cords that bit deep into the flesh. Then the rough upward pull almost  jerked my shoulders from their sockets and I heard the giant _chak_  grunt with effort as I was hauled upward until my feet barely, on  tiptoe, touched the floor.    \"Blindfold him,\" said Dallisa languidly, \"so that he cannot watch the  ascent of the sun or its descent or know what is to come.\"    A dark softness muffled my eyes. After a little I heard her steps  retreating. My arms, wrenched overhead and numbed with the bite of the  cords, were beginning to hurt badly now. But it wasn't too bad. Surely  she did not mean that this should be all....    Sternly I controlled my imagination, taking a tight rein on my thoughts.  There was only one way to meet this--hanging blind and racked in space,  my toes barely scrabbling at the floor--and that was to take each thing  as it came and not look ahead for an instant. First of all I tried to  get my feet under me, and discovered that by arching upwards to my  fullest height I could bear my weight on tiptoe and ease, a little, the  dislocating ache in my armpits by slackening the overhead rope.    But after a little, a cramping pain began to flare through the arches of  my feet, and it became impossible to support my weight on tiptoe. I  jarred down with violent strain on my wrists and wrenched shoulders  again, and for a moment the shooting agony was so intense that I nearly  screamed. I thought I heard a soft breath near me.    After a little it subsided to a sharp ache, then to a dull ache, and  then to the violent cramping pain again, and once more I struggled to  get my toes under me. I realized that by allowing my toes barely to  touch the floor they had doubled and tripled the pain by the tantalizing  hope of, if not momentary relief, at least the alteration of one pain  for another.    I haven't the faintest idea, even now, how long I repeated that  agonizing cycle: struggle for a toehold on rough stone, scraping my bare  feet raw; arch upward with all my strength to release for a few moments  the strain on my wrenched shoulders; the momentary illusion of relief as  I found my balance and the pressure lightened on my wrists.    Then the slow creeping, first of an ache, then of a pain, then of a  violent agony in the arches of feet and calves. And, delayed to the last  endurable moment, that final terrible anguish when the drop of my full  weight pulled shoulder and wrist and elbow joints with that  bone-shattering jerk.    I started once to estimate how much time had passed, how many hours had  crawled by, then checked myself, for that was imminent madness. But once  the process had begun my brain would not abandon and I found myself,  with compulsive precision, counting off the seconds and the minutes in  each cycle: stretch upward, release the pressure on the arms; the  beginning of pain in calves and arches and toes; the creeping of pain up  ribs and loins and shoulders; the sudden jarring drop on the arms again.    My throat was intolerably dry. Under other circumstances I might have  estimated the time by the growth of hunger and thirst, but the rough  treatment I had received made this impossible. There were other,  unmentionable, humiliating pains.    After a time, to bolster my flagging courage, I found myself thinking of  all the ways it might have been worse. I had heard of a _shegrin_  exposed to the bite of poisonous--not fatal, but painfully  poisonous--insects, and to the worrying of the small gnawing rodents  which can be trained to bite and tear. Or I might have been branded....    I banished the memory with the powerful exorcism; the man in Daillon  whose anticipation, alone, of a torture which never came, had broken his  mind. There was only one way to conquer this, and that was to act as if  the present moment was the only one, and never for a moment to forget  that the strongest of compacts bound them not to harm me, that the end  of this was fixed by sunset.    Gradually, however, all such rational thoughts blurred in a semidelirium  of thirst and pain, narrowing to a red blaze of agony across my shoulder  blades. I eased up on my toes again.    White-hot pain blazed through my feet. The rough stone on which my toes  sank had been covered with metal and I smelled scorching flesh, jerking  up my feet with a wordless snarl of rage and fury, hanging in agony by  my shoulders alone.    And then I lost consciousness, at least for several moments, for when I  became aware again, through the nightmare of pain, my toes were resting  lightly and securely on cold stone. The smell of burned flesh remained,  and the painful stinging in my toes. Mingled with that smell was a drift  of perfume close by.    Dallisa murmured, \"I do not wish to break our bargain by damaging your  feet. It's only a little touch of fire to keep you from too much  security in resting them.\"    I felt the taste of blood mingle in my mouth with the sour taste of  vomit. I felt delirious, lightheaded. After another eternity I wondered  if I had really heard Dallisa's lilting croon or whether it was a  nightmare born of feverish pain:    _Plead with me. A word, only a word and I will release you, strong man,  scarred man. Perhaps I shall demand only a little space in your arms.  Would not such doom be light upon you? Perhaps I shall set you free to  seek Rakhal if only to plague Kyral. A word, only a word from you. A  word, only a word from you...._    It died into an endlessly echoing whisper. Swaying, blinded, I wondered  why I endured. I drew a dry tongue over lips, salty and bloody, and  nightmarishly considered yielding, winning my way somehow around  Dallisa. Or knocking her suddenly senseless and escaping--I, who need  not be bound by Wolf's codes either. I fumbled with a stiff shape of  words.    And a breath saved me, a soft, released breath of anticipation. It was  another trick. I swayed, limp and racked. I was not Race Cargill now. I  was a dead man hanging in chains, swinging, filthy vultures pecking at  my dangling feet. I was....    The sound of boots rang on the stone and Kyral's voice, low and bitter,  demanded somewhere behind me, \"What have you done with him?\"    She did not answer, but I heard her chains clash lightly and imagined  her gesture. Kyral muttered, \"Women have no genius at any torture  except....\" His voice faded out into great distances. Their words came  to me over a sort of windy ringing, like the howling of lost men, dying  in the snowfast passes of the mountains.    \"Speak up, you fool, he can't hear you now.\"    \"If you have let him faint, you are clumsy!\"    \"_You_ talk of clumsiness!\" Dallisa's voice, even thinned by the  nightmare ringing in my head, held concentrated scorn. \"Perhaps I shall  release him, to find Rakhal when you failed! The Terrans have a price on  Rakhal's head, too. And at least this man will not confuse himself with  his prey!\"    \"If you think I would let you bargain with a _Terranan_--\"    Dallisa cried passionately, \"You trade with the Terrans! How would you  stop me, then?\"    \"I trade with them because I must. But for a matter involving the honor  of the Great House--\"    \"The Great House whose steps you would never have climbed, except for  Rakhal!\" Dallisa sounded as if she were chewing her words in little  pieces and spitting them at Kyral. \"Oh, you were clever to take us both  as your consorts! You did not know it was Rakhal's doing, did you? Hate  the Terrans, then!\" She spat an obscenity at him. \"Enjoy your hate,  wallow in hating, and in the end all Shainsa will fall prey to the  Toymaker, like Miellyn.\"    \"If you speak that name again,\" said Kyral very low, \"I will kill you.\"    \"Like Miellyn, Miellyn, Miellyn,\" Dallisa repeated deliberately. \"You  fool, Rakhal knew nothing of Miellyn!\"    \"He was seen--\"    \"With _me_, you fool! With _me_! You cannot yet tell twin from twin?  Rakhal came to _me_ to ask news of her!\"    Kyral cried out hoarsely, like a man in anguish, \"Why didn't you tell  me?\"    \"You don't really have to ask, do you, Kyral?\"    \"You bitch!\" said Kyral. \"You filthy bitch!\" I heard the sound of a  blow. The next moment Kyral ripped the blindfold from my eyes and I  blinked in the blaze of light. My arms were wholly numb now, twisted  above my head, but the jar of his touch sent fresh pain racing through  me. Kyral's face swam out of the blaze of hell. \"If that is true, then  this is a damnable farce, Dallisa. You have lost our chance of learning  what he knows of Miellyn.\"    \"What _he_ knows?\" Dallisa lowered her hand from her face, where a  bruise was already darkening.    \"Miellyn has twice appeared when I was with him. Loose him, Dallisa, and  bargain with him. What we know of Rakhal for what he knows of Miellyn.\"    \"If you think I would let you bargain with _Terranan_,\" she mocked.  \"Weakling, this quarrel is _mine_! You fool, the others in the caravan  will give me news, if you will not! _Where is Cuinn?_\"    From a million miles away Kyral laughed. \"You've slipped the wrong hawk,  Dallisa. The catmen killed him.\" His skean flicked loose. He climbed to  a perch near the rope at my wrists. \"Bargain with me, Rascar!\"    I coughed, "]]]
