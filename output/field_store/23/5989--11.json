I thought this was as much as we could desire at present, and that the  policy of a marriage with a French Prince might safely be left to be  considered whenever the contingency contemplated should arrive. Many  things may happen, both in France and Spain, in the course of a few  years to affect this question in a manner not now apparent.    ABERDEEN.        [Footnote 22: Parliament was prorogued on the 9th of August,      and the Queen and Prince sailed in the evening for Antwerp      in the Royal yacht. Sir Theodore Martin gives a very full      description of the visit to Coburg. The Queen was especially      delighted with the Rosenau and Reinhardtsbrunn. On the morning      of the 8th of September the yacht, which had left the Scheldt      on the previous evening, arrived at Treport, and a second      visit was paid to the King and Queen of the French at the      Chateau d'Eu.]        [Footnote 23: Younger son of Don Francisco de Paula, and first      cousin to Queen Isabella, both through his father and his      mother.]          [Pageheading: CHURCH APPOINTMENTS]      _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    OSBORNE, _15th September 1845._    Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave to  acquaint your Majesty that there remains the sum of L700 to be applied  in the current year to the grant of Civil List Pensions.    Sir Robert Peel humbly recommends to your Majesty that another sum  of L200 should be offered to Mr Tennyson, a poet of whose powers of  imagination and expression many competent judges think most highly.    He was brought under the notice of Sir Robert Peel by Mr Hallam. His  pecuniary circumstances are far from being prosperous.    There is a vacancy in the Deanery of Lincoln, but the preferment is  less eligible from there being no residence, and the necessity for  building one at the immediate expense of the new Dean.    Sir Robert Peel is inclined to recommend to your Majesty that an  offer of this preferment should be made to Mr Ward, the Rector of St  James's.    Should Mr Ward decline, there is a clergyman of the name of  Maurice,[24] of whom the Archbishop says: \"Of unbeneficed London  clergy there is no one, I believe, who is so much distinguished by his  learning and literary talent as the Rev. Frederick Maurice, Chaplain  of St Guy's Hospital. His private character is equally estimable.\"    Should Mr Ward decline[25] the Deanery it might, should your Majesty  approve of it, be offered to Mr Maurice. The Archbishop says that the  appointment of Mr Maurice would be very gratifying to the _King of  Prussia_.        [Footnote 24: Frederick Denison Maurice (1805-1872), the      friend of Kingsley, afterwards Chaplain of St. Peter's, Vere      Street.]        [Footnote 25: Mr Ward accepted the Deanery.]          _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    ST CLOUD, _10th October 1845._    MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... All you say about our dear Albert, whom  I love like my own child, is perfectly true. The attacks, however  unjust, have but one advantage, that of showing the points the enemy  thinks _weakest_ and best calculated to hurt. This, being the case,  Anson, without boring A. with _daily_ accounts which in the end  become very irksome, should pay attention to these very points, and  contribute to avoid what may be turned to account by the enemy.  To hope to _escape_ censure and calumny is next to impossible, but  whatever is considered by the enemy as a fit subject for attack is  better modified or avoided. The dealings with artists, for instance,  require great prudence; they are acquainted with all classes of  society, and for that very reason dangerous; they are hardly _ever  satisfied_, and when you have too much to do with them, you are sure  to have _des ennuis_.... Your devoted Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.          [Pageheading: LORD METCALFE]      _Queen Victoria to Lord Stanley._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _2nd November 1845._    The Queen has read with great concern Lord Stanley's letter of the  1st November. From private information she had been led to expect that  Lord Metcalfe would not be able to continue at his irksome post.[26]  He will be an immense loss, and the selection of a successor will be  most difficult. The Queen hopes that there will not be too great a  delay in making the new appointment, as experience has shown that  nothing was more detrimental to the good government of Canada than the  last interregnum after Sir Charles Bagot's death; it would certainly  likewise be desirable that Lord Metcalfe should be able personally  to make over his Government to his successor, whom he could verbally  better put in possession of the peculiarities of his position than  any instructions could do. It strikes the Queen to be of the _greatest  importance_, that the judicious system pursued by Lord Metcalfe (and  which, after a long continuation of toil and adversities, only  now just begins to show its effect) should be followed up by his  successor.    The Queen knows nobody who would be as fit for the appointment as Lord  Elgin, who seems to have given great satisfaction in Jamaica, where he  has already succeeded Lord Metcalfe, whose original appointment there  had _likewise_ taken place under circumstances of great difficulty,  which his prudence and firmness finally overcame.[27]        [Footnote 26: He retired from the Governor-Generalship of      Canada through ill-health.]        [Footnote 27: Lord Stanley, in reply, submitted a private      letter from Lord Elgin, expressing a wish to return home; Earl      Cathcart was provisionally appointed Governor-General.]          _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    OSBORNE, _28th November 1845._    The Queen is very sorry to hear that Sir Robert Peel apprehends  further differences of opinion in the Cabinet, at a moment of  impending calamity; it is more than ever necessary that the Government  should be strong and united.    The Queen thinks the time is come when a removal of the restrictions  upon the importation of food cannot be successfully resisted. Should  this be Sir Robert's own opinion, the Queen very much hopes that none  of his colleagues will prevent him from doing what it is _right_ to  do.          [Pageheading: THE CORN LAWS]      _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _4th December 1845._    Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave  to acquaint your Majesty that a leading paragraph in the _Times_ of  to-day, asserting that your Majesty's servants had unanimously agreed  to an immediate and total repeal of the Corn Laws, is quite without  foundation.[28]        [Footnote 28: See _Memoirs of the Life of Henry Reeve_, vol.      i. p. 175, for Lord Dufferin's refutation of the story that      Sidney Herbert confided the secret to Mrs Norton, and that she      sold it to the _Times_. The story has obtained a wide currency      through Mr Meredith's _Diana of the Crossways_. Lord Stanmore,      in his _Life of Sidney Herbert_, substantially attributes      the communication to Lord Aberdeen, but does not give the      details.]          _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._[29]    WHITEHALL, _5th December 1845._    (_Friday evening._)    Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and will  wait upon your Majesty to-morrow evening, leaving London by the  half-past twelve train.    Sir Robert Peel will avail himself of your Majesty's kind proposal to  remain at Osborne until Monday morning.    He will come to Osborne with a heart full of gratitude and devotion to  your Majesty, but with a strong conviction (all the grounds for which  he will, with your Majesty's permission, explain to your Majesty) that  in the present state of affairs, he can render more service to your  Majesty and to the country in a private than in a public station.        [Footnote 29: Peel reported to the Queen the Cabinet      discussions on the Corn Law question. The Queen wrote that      the news caused her much uneasiness, and that she felt certain      that her Minister would not leave her at a moment of such      difficulty, and when a crisis was impending.]          [Pageheading: CABINET DISSENSIONS]    [Pageheading: INTERVIEW WITH PEEL]      _Memorandum by the Prince Albert._    OSBORNE, _7th December 1845._    On receiving the preceding letter[30] ... we were, of course, in great  consternation. Yesterday Sir Robert Peel arrived here and explained  the condition of affairs.        [Footnote 30: From Sir Robert Peel, 5th December, _ante._]    On 1st November he had called his Cabinet, and placed before its  members the reports of the Irish Commissioners, Dr Buckland, Dr  Playfair and Dr Lindley, on the condition of the potato crop, which  was to the effect that the half of the potatoes were ruined by the  rot, and that no one could guarantee the remainder. Belgium, Holland,  Sweden, and Denmark, in which states the potato disease had likewise  deprived the poorer class of its usual food, have immediately taken  energetic means, and have opened the harbours, bought corn, and  provided for the case of a rise of prices. Sir Robert proposed the  same thing for England, and, by opening the ports, a preparation for  the abolition of the Corn Laws. His colleagues refused, and of the  whole Cabinet only Lord Aberdeen, Sir James Graham, and Mr Sidney  Herbert voted with him. Sir Robert hoped that in time the opinions of  the others would change, and therefore postponed a final decision.  In the meanwhile the agitation of the Anti-Corn Law League began;  in every town addresses were voted, meetings were held, the  _Times_--barometer of public feeling--became suddenly _violently_  Anti-Corn Law, the meetings of the Cabinet roused attention, a general  panic seized on the mass of the public. Sir Robert called anew his  Cabinet. In the midst of their deliberation Lord John Russell issues  from Edinburgh "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#13)"],[1," taught by a  tutor at home, as we have seen. Palsgrave was tutor to Henry VIII.'s  \"most dere and most entirely beloved suster, quene Mary, douagier of  France,\" and no doubt wrote his _Lesclaircissement de la Langue  Francoise_ mainly for her, though also \"desirous to do some humble  service unto the nobilitie of this victorious realme, and universally  unto all other estates of this my natyfe country.\" Giles Du Guez, or as  Palsgrave says to Henry VIII., \"the synguler clerke, maister Gyles  Dewes, somtyme instructor to your noble grace in this selfe tong, at the  especiall instaunce and request of dyvers of your highe estates and  noble men, hath also for his partye written in this matter.\" His book is  entitled \"An Introductorie for to lerne to rede, to pronounce & to speke  French trewly: compyled for the Right high, excellent, and most vertuous  lady The Lady Mary of Englande, doughter to our most gracious soverayn  Lorde Kyng Henry the Eight.\"        [Headnote: UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN EARLY ENGLAND.]    3. _English University Education._ In early days Cambridge and Oxford  must be looked on, I suppose, as mainly the great schools for boys, and  the generality of scholars as poor men's children,[37] like Chaucer's  'poore scolares tuo that dwelten in the soler-halle of Cantebregge,' his  Clerk of Oxenford, and those students, gifts to whom are considered as  one of the regular burdens on the husbandman, in \"God speed the Plough.\"  Mr Froude says, Hist. of England, I. 37:      \"The universities were well filled, by the sons of yeomen chiefly.    The cost of supporting them at the colleges was little, and    wealthy men took a pride in helping forward any boys of    promise[38] (_Latimer's Sermons_, p. 64). It seems clear also, as    the Reformation drew nearer, while the clergy were sinking lower    and lower, a marked change for the better became perceptible in a    portion at least of the laity.\"    But Grosseteste mentions a \"noble\" scholar at Oxford (_Epist._ 129), and  Edward the Black Prince and Henry V. are said to have been students of  Queen's College, Oxford. Wolsey himself was a College tutor at Oxford,  and had among his pupils the sons of the Marquess of Dorset, who  afterwards gave him his first preferment, the living of Lymington.  (Chappell.) [[38a]]    The legend runs that the first school at Oxford was founded by King  Alfred[39], and that Oxford was a place of study in the time of Edward  the Confessor (1041-66). If one may quote a book now considered to be 'a  monkish forgery and an exploded authority,' Ingulfus, who was Abbot of  Croyland, in the Isle of Ely, under William the Conqueror, says of  himself that he was educated first at Westminster, and then passed to  Oxford, where he made proficiency in such books of Aristotle as were  then accessible to students,[40] and in the first two books of Tully's  Rhetoric.--_Malden_, On the Origin of Universities, 1835, p. 71.    In 1201 Oxford is called a _University_, and said to have contained 3000  scholars; in 1253 its first College (University) is founded. In 1244,  Hen. III. grants it its first privileges as a corporate body, and  confirms and extends them in 1245. In his reign, Wood says the number of  scholars amounted to 30,000, a number no doubt greatly exaggerated.        [Headnote: POVERTY OF UNIVERSITY SCHOLARS.]    In the reign of Stephen, we know that Vacarius, a Lombard by birth, who  had studied the civil law at Bologna, came into England, and formed a  school of law at Oxford[41] ... he remained in England in the reign of  Henry II. On account of the difficulty and expense of obtaining copies  of the original books of the Roman law, and _the poverty of his English  scholars_, Vacarius [ab. 1149, A.D.] compiled an abridgment of the  Digests and Codex, in which their most essential parts were preserved,  with some difference of arrangement, and illustrated from other  law-books.... It bore on its title that it was \"_pauperibus presertim  destinatus_;\" and hence the Oxford students of law obtained the name of  _Pauperists._--_Malden_, p. 72-3.    Roger Bacon (who died 1248)[[41a]] speaks of a young fellow who came to  him, aged 15, not having wherewithal to live, or finding proper masters:  \"because he was obliged to serve those who gave him necessaries, during  two years found no one to teach him a word in the things he learned.\"  --_Opus Tertium_, cap. xx. In 1214 the Commonalty of Oxford agreed to  pay 52s. yearly for the use of poor scholars, and to give 100 of them a  meal of bread, ale, and pottage, with one large dish of flesh or fish,  every St Nicholas day.--_Wood's An._ i. 185. _Wood's Annals_ (ed. Gutch,  v. i. p. 619-20) also notes that in 1461 A.D. divers Scholars were  forced to get a license under the Chancellor's hand and seal (according  to the Stat. 12 Ric. II., A.D. 1388, _Ib._, p. 519) to beg: and Sir  Thos. More says \"then may wee yet, like poor Scholars of Oxford, go a  begging with our baggs & wallets, & sing salve Regina at rich mens  dores.\" On this point we may also compare the Statutes of Walter de  Merton for his College at Oxford, A.D. 1274, ed. Halliwell, 1843, p. 19:      Cap. 13. De admissione scholarium.      Hoc etiam in eadem domo specialiter observari volo et decerno, ut    circa eos, qui ad hujusmodi eleemosinæ participationem admittendi    fuerint, diligenti solicitudine caveatur, ne qui præter castos,    honestos, pacificos, humiles, _indigentes_, ad studium habiles ac    proficere volentes, admittantur. Ad quorum agnitionem singulis,    cum in dicta societate fuerint admittendi sustentationis gratia in    eadem, ad annum unum utpote probationis causa primitus concedatur,    ut sic demum si in dictis conditionibus laudabiliter se habuerint,    in dictam congregationem admittantur.      See also cap. 31, against horses of scholars being kept.    Lodgings were let according to the joint valuation of 2 Magistri  (scholars) and two townsmen (probi et legales homines de Villa). _Wood_,  i. 255. An. 15 Hen. III. A.D. 1230-1.    In the beginning of the 15th century it had become the established rule  that every scholar must be a member of some college or hall. The  scholars who attended the public lectures of the university, without  entering themselves at any college or hall, were called _chamber  dekyns_, as in Paris they were called martinets; and frequent enactments  were made against them.--_Malden_, p. 85, ref. to _Woods Annals_, 1408,  -13, -22, and 1512, &c.

I was promised venison against my feast, of my Lady  Harcourt, and of another person too, but I was deceived of both; but my  guests held them pleased with such meat as they had, blessed be God.\"  The letter as to the costs is dated May 19, 1478.      \"I marvel sore that you sent me no word of the letter which I sent    to you by Master William Brown at Easter.
