I must go.\"    \"Wait a few minutes,\" requested Marjorie. \"I have something to show you,  but I must see mother for a minute first. Please excuse me. I'll be back  directly.\"    \"Mother,\" Marjorie hurried into the living-room. \"Have you thought of a  way? Constance is going home, and it's now or never.\"    \"Suppose you give it to her by yourself,\" suggested her mother. \"I am  afraid my presence will embarrass her and then she will surely refuse.\"    Marjorie stood eyeing her mother uncertainly. Then she laughed. \"I know  the easiest way in the world,\" she declared, and was gone.    When she entered the room Constance was kneeling interestedly before the  book-shelves. \"You have the 'Jungle Books,' haven't you? Don't you love  them?\"    \"Yes,\" laughed Marjorie. \"Mary and I read them together. I always called  myself 'Bagheera' the black panther, and she always called herself  'Mogli, the man-cub.' We used to write notes to each other sometimes in  the language of the jungle.\"    \"How funny,\" smiled Constance. Her gaze intent upon the books, she did  not notice that Marjorie had stepped to her closet, returning to her bed  with a cloud of pink over her arm. Next she opened a big box and laid a  cloud of blue beside the one of pink. \"Constance, come here a minute,\"  she said.    Constance sprang up obediently. Her glance fell upon the bed and she  gave a little startled, admiring \"Oh!\"    Marjorie linked her arm in that of her friend and drew her up to the  bed. \"This gown,\" she pointed to the pink one, \"is mine, and this one,\"  she withdrew her arm, and lifting the blue cloud held it out to  Constance, \"is yours.\"    The Mary girl drew back sharply. \"I don't know what you mean,\" she  muttered. \"Please don't make fun of me.\"    \"I'm not making fun of you. It's your very own, and after I tell you all  about it you'll see just why it happens to be yours.\"    Seated on the edge of the bed beside Marjorie, the wonderful blue gown  on her lap, the girl who had never owned a party dress before heard the  story of how it happened to be hers. At first she steadily refused its  acceptance, but in the end wily Marjorie persuaded her to \"just try it  on,\" and when she saw herself, for the first time in her  poverty-stricken young life, wearing a real evening gown that glimpsed  her unusually white neck and arms she wavered. So intent was she upon  examining her reflection that she did not notice Marjorie had slipped  from the room, returning with a pair of blue silk stockings and satin  slippers to match. \"These go with it,\" she announced.    \"Oh--I--can't,\" faltered Constance, making a move toward unhooking the  frock.    \"Of course you can.\" Marjorie deposited the stockings and slippers on  the foot of her bed and going over to Constance put both arms around  her. \"You are going to have this dress because mother and I want you to.  I can't possibly wear it myself, and it's a shame to lay it away in the  closet until it is all out of style. Please, please take it. You simply  must, for I won't go to the dance unless you do, and you know how  dreadfully I should hate to miss it. I mean what I say, too.\"    \"I'll take it,\" said Constance, slowly.    Suddenly she slipped from Marjorie's encircling arm and leaned against  the chiffonier, covering her face with her hands.    \"Constance!\" Marjorie cried out in surprise. \"You mustn't cry.\"    \"I--can't--help--it.\" The words came brokenly. \"Ever since I was little  I've dreamed about a blue dress like this. You--are--too--good--to--me.  Nobody--was--ever--good to me before.\"    It was a quarter to eleven o'clock before Constance, her tears dried,  her face beaming with a new expression of happiness, left the Deans'  house, accompanied by Mr. Dean, who had come in shortly before ten  o'clock and insisted on seeing her safely home.    Later, as she prepared for bed in her bare little room she could not  help wondering why Marjorie had desired her for a best friend, and had  clung to her in spite of the displeasure of certain other girls. She  wondered, too, if there were any way in which she might show Marjorie  her affection and gratitude, and she made a solemn resolve that if that  time came she would prove herself worthy of Marjorie Dean's friendship.          CHAPTER XI    THE HALLOWE'EN DANCE      Saturday dawned as inauspiciously as any other day in the week, but to  the high school boys and girls of the little city of Sanford it was a  day set apart. Aside from commencement, the great event of their high  school year was about to take place.    As early as eight o'clock that morning the decorating committee of  Weston High School was up and laboring manfully at the task of turning  Weston's big gymnasium into a veritable bower of beauty, which should,  in due season, draw forth plenty of admiring \"Ohs!\" and \"Ahs!\" from  their gentle guests. For three days the committee had been borrowing,  with lavish promises of safe return, as many cushions, draperies,  chairs, divans and various other articles calculated to fitly adorn the  ballroom, as their families and friends confidingly allowed them to  carry off.    Their progress along this line had been painstakingly watched by  numerous pairs of sharp, young eyes, and the report had gone forth among  the girls that this particular Hallowe'en party was going to be \"the  nicest dance the boys had ever given.\"    To Marjorie Dean, however, the event promised more than the usual  interest. It was to be her first opportunity of entering into the social  life of the boys and girls of Sanford. In B---- she had numbered many  stanch friends among the young men of Lafayette High School, but she had  lived in Sanford for, what seemed to her, a very long time and had not  met a single Weston boy. Jerry had promised to introduce Marjorie to her  brother and to the tall, fair-haired youth known as the Crane, but so  far the young people had not been thrown together. Marjorie had no  silly, sentimental ideas in her curly brown head about boys. From early  childhood she had been allowed to play with them. She was fond of their  games and had always evinced far more interest in marbles, tops and even  baseball than she had in dolls. Still, at sixteen, she was not a hoyden  nor a tomboy, but a merry, light-hearted girl with a strong, healthy  body and a feeling of comradeship toward boys in general which was to  carry her far in her later life.    At the time she had given Constance the blue gown she had also gained  her friend's rather reluctant consent to come to dinner at the Deans' on  the great night and dress with her for the dance. Marjorie attributed  Constance's hesitation to shyness. Always reticent regarding her home  life, Constance, aside from her one outburst relating to her family  on the day when she had advised Marjorie against her friendship, had  said little or nothing further of her home. So Marjorie did not know  that it was not a matter of shyness, but rather a question of who would  keep house and get the supper while she was out enjoying herself, that  caused Constance to demur before accepting the invitation. Then she  remembered that Hallowe'en came on Saturday and decided that she could  manage after all.    The momentous Saturday dawned clear and cold, with just the suspicion of  a fall tang to the air. It was a busy day for the Weston boys, and when  at four o'clock the last garland of green had been twined about the  gymnasium posts and the gallery railing, while the last flag had been  painstakingly hung at the proper angle, the dozen or more of young men  who formed the decorating committee viewed their work with boyish pride.    \"It looks bully,\" shouted an enthusiastic freshman, with a sweep of his  arm which was intended to include the whole room. \"If the girls aren't  suited with this, they won't be invited over here again in a hurry.\"    \"Hear him rave!\" sadly commented a sophomore. \"It takes a freshman to  fall all over himself.\"    \"That's because we are young and have more enthusiasm,\" retorted the  freshman, his freckled face alive with an impish grin.        \"Desist from your squabbles      And join in the waltz,\"    caroled an extremely tall, thin youth, pirouetting on his toes, and  waving a long trail of ground pine about his head in true premiere  danseuse fashion.    There was a shout of laughter from the boys at this burst of  terpsichorean art. The tall youth pranced and whirled the length of the  gymnasium and back, ending his performance with a swift, high kick and a  bow that bade fair to dislocate his spine.    \"Did I hear someone laugh?\" he asked severely, drawing down his face  with such an indescribably funny expression that the laughter broke  forth afresh. \"It is evident that you don't appreciate my rare ability  as a dancer.\"    \"You mean as a grasshopper,\" jeered the freckle-faced youth.    \"Exactly. No, I don't either. How dare you insult me?\" He made a lengthy  lunge toward the freshman, who promptly dodged behind a tall,  good-looking young man who had at that moment joined the group.    The lunging youth brought up short with, \"Hello, Hal, I thought you had  gone.\"    \"So I had. Got halfway home and found I'd left my pocketknife here.  Maybe I didn't hotfoot it back though. Hope the girls will like the  looks of things.\" He cast approving eyes about the transformed  gymnasium. \"Jerry's been raving to me ever since school began about her  new friend, Marjorie Dean. Have you met her? I understand she is coming  to-night.\"    \"Not I, I can't tell one of those girls from another,\" grumbled the  Crane. \"You know just how much I like girls. I don't mind helping get  ready for this business, but I'd rather take a licking than come back  here to-night.

Among David's first followers were some clever warriors of the tribe of  Gad, men fierce in war, and strong and swift of foot. With him also was  the prophet Gad himself, and there were even some men from the tribe of  Benjamin, the tribe to which King Saul belonged, who joined David's  company. It seems to have been a peculiarity of the Benjamites that  they could use either hand with equal skill, and those who joined David  were armed with bows, and were very valuable allies because they could  use both the right hand and the left at once in hurling stones, and  shooting arrows, and never miss their aim. At first David feared  treachery from these Benjamites, but when he asked them frankly what  their intentions were, they said:    \"We are thine, David, peace be unto thee and thy helpers, for thy God  helpeth thee.\" Then David received them, and made them captains of his  army, and they became enthusiastic admirers of their young leader, as  were all David's band.    One incident shows what passionate affection his men felt for him.  Saul's army in losing David had lost the one captain who could keep the  Philistines in check, and they were over-running the country in  numerous bands, having their headquarters in the valley of Rephaim,  near Jerusalem. One night, in a moment of fond recollection of a  happier past, David cried out in an intense longing for a drink of  water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem by which he had often  driven his sheep in his younger days. At once, three of his men,  without telling him what they were going to do, forced a passage  through the Philistine lines and brought him the water for which he  longed. Touched by the act, but always modest, David refused to allow  men to risk their lives simply for his gratification and poured out the  water as a sacrifice to God, according to the religious ceremony of  that time, for it was as good as blood, David said, and the three men  who brought it to him were afterwards counted among the mightiest of  his heroes.    Besides these men, all the others of his little band were devoted to  him, seeing his courage and his unconditional dependence on God under  all circumstances. The wild, rough life brought out all the manhood  there was in his little band of outlaw warriors who were occupied  mainly in guerilla warfare with marauding tribes and in eluding the  pursuit of Saul, and in this way several years passed, during which  time, David's life was full of stirring events, but many a night as he  wandered underneath the stars, his thoughts turned in passionate  longing to Jonathan, for whom his heart cried out--for Jonathan, whose  life was as different from David's, for he had all the comforts of  luxurious living, and all the elegance and pomp which were the natural  surroundings of a King's son. And yet he was far from happy, for he too  longed for David, and he was obliged to spend a large part of his time  in watching over his father, whose weakness of character he understood  perfectly, and to keep the King from dangerous acts and damaging  outbursts of temper, required all of young Jonathan's tact, and most of  his time and strength.    Meanwhile, the prophet Gad whose advice was supposed to be divinely  inspired, told David that it was no longer safe to remain in the cave  of Adullam, so the little band of outlaws left the place where they had  been for so long encamped and as outlaws have always done, they took  refuge in a forest, somewhere among the hills of Judah.    It was now the end of harvest time in May, and news was brought to  David that the town of Keilah was being harassed by plundering bands of  Philistines. As the town evidently did not belong to Judah at this  time, Saul did not move a finger to protect it, although the enemy had  shut up the citizens within their own walls and were robbing the loaded  threshing floors outside. David deliberated long and prayerfully,  together with the priest Abiathar, who was one of his followers,  deciding whether he might successfully attack the bands who were  robbing Keilah. His men were rather fearful of the enterprise, but when  Abiathar decided in favour of it, David's band at once marched over the  highlands of Judah, and surprised and defeated the Philistines with  great loss, and took much booty. David even established himself in the  town, but when Saul discovered that fact, he called out all the forces  of Israel, and prepared to besiege David, full of fiendish joy that the  prey he had so long sought was in his hands at last, for the capture of  four hundred men in a fortress however strong, could only be for his  large army, a question of time. All this became known to David, who was  warned by Abiathar that the inhabitants of Keilah would be compelled  for their own safety to give him up to Saul, and his four hundred men  only saved themselves by a hasty flight breaking up into detachments,  and fleeing wherever they could go, while David with only a handful of  his army, made his way once again into the hospitable wilderness which  stretches from the hills of Judah to the shores of the Dead Sea, and  there he hid in secret places among the crags and tangled brush, while  with fiendish perseverance, Saul sought him every day. But every day  God saved him from capture, yet as the days passed he became weary and  discouraged in heart. Then in a lonely hour there came a rare joy to  David--Jonathan, his friend, stood beside him with outstretched hands  and beaming eyes, joy expressed on every line of his sensitive,  delicate face.    David has no words ready for such a joyous moment--he is no longer the  brave warrior--leader of men. He throws his arms about Jonathan's neck,  and tears come,--yes, tears,--and Jonathan too, is unnerved, but there  is no time to lose, they may be discovered any moment and that will  mean death for at least one of them. Jonathan is the first to speak,  clasping David's hand closely.    \"Fear not,\" he says in a clear, calm voice, \"the hand of Saul, my  father, shall not find thee, and thou shalt be King over Israel, and I  shall be next unto thee, and that also my father knoweth.\"    So spoke Jonathan, and the words came from his heart, for knowing as he  did of all the courageous acts of David, and of all the diplomacy he  had used to help others as well as himself, Jonathan's heart told him  that his friend was truly worthy to be King of Israel rather than he,  the rightful heir to the throne, and with deepest love and admiration  in his eyes and voice, and at peril of his life, should he be found  with David, he told David this, and David's eyes shone with joy and  pride in his friend's appreciation, and his hand-clasp grew firmer, and  there was deep, intense silence while the two friends thought of past  and future, and looked into each other's eyes as comrades look who  trust and understand.    Then, Jonathan renewed his covenant of friendship for David, and of  loyalty to his descendants for ever, and David began to give his  answering promise, but he could not finish the words because of a great  sob which burst from him. And Jonathan could say no words of comfort,  for his soul was full of misery too, because he must so soon part from  David. Then David who was quick to see and feel Jonathan's pain, turned  away, and hastily, with a mighty effort controlled his misery, that his  friend might not see sorrow on his face, and with one last look  Jonathan turned and silently went from the forest, out into the larger  world and back into the less free life that was his at the Court of his  father. Back to his own duty which he never shirked, went Jonathan, and  to David remained only the fulfilling of that renewed covenant of  comradeship. And fulfil it he did.    In the following months Saul still sought daily to kill him, but daily  failed to do so, and instead David had an opportunity to capture and  kill Saul, when he came upon him by night sleeping, with his spear  stuck in the ground at his head, and surrounded by Abner and his people  who were sleeping too. Think what a temptation that was for David to  resist! But even though it would have freed his life of a dangerous  enemy and raised him to the throne, David would not yield to it, for he  said:    \"Who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and be  guiltless? The Lord shall smite him, or his day will come to die, or he  will descend into the battle and perish, but God forbid that I should  stretch my hand against him.\"    And never did he raise his hand against Saul, though still Saul pursued  him with relentless hatred, but still David escaped from his hand, and  he and his band of followers became daily more famous for their deeds  of valour, and for the brave warfare they waged against their enemies.    War again broke out between the Israelites and the Philistines. David  and his men who were not now with either army, but who had just  captured the Amalekites and taken from them large booty, were rejoicing  over this victory, when joy was turned to sorrow. News was brought to  David that both Saul and Jonathan had fallen in battle against the  Philistines at Gilboa.    Jonathan gone from him! Jonathan, his friend, gone beyond his sight for  ever! David refused to believe this until he who brought the sad  tidings had again and again given proof of its truth. Then David gave  way to his grief, and he and all his men who sorrowed with him, wept  and mourned and fasted until evening, for Saul, the king, and for  Jonathan, his son, and David mourned as one who cannot be comforted.    Although David had known only too well the truth about Saul's great  weakness, and had feared him as his most dangerous enemy, still to him  was Saul always"]]]
