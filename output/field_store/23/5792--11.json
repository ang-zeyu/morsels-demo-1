He stepped from his  hiding-place, quickly deciding to walk nonchalantly forward, the open  veld leaving no possible means of pursuing his way under cover.    He passes many isolated homesteads, some ruined and deserted, others  inhabited by aged people, delicate women, and little children only.  One and all they shrink from him when he relates his story. They do  not trust him--he may be in the employment of the British, a trap set  for the unwary; their homes are closed to him. He pursues his way  wearily. What is that approaching him in the distance? With straining  eyes he is able to distinguish a group of horsemen coming towards him,  and with lightning-like rapidity he turns from his course and jumps  into the washed-out bed of a small rivulet flowing by. A group of  startled Kaffir children gaze at him in astonishment. The riders come  in clear view--not horsemen, but a number of Kaffir women with  earthenware pots on their heads. These they fill with water, and  mounting their horses depart the way they came.    With renewed hope and thankfulness at his heart our traveller resumes  his course in the lengthening shadows of the short winter afternoon.  At last he reaches a German mission station.    No refuge for him here! For the inhabitants are \"neutral,\" but he is  informed that a few days before 20,000 British troops had passed that  way in a northward direction, in hot pursuit of the Boer commandos  fleeing to the Waterberg district. The benevolent old missionary  directs him to a small farm in the neighbourhood where a Boer woman  lives alone with her little children. Perhaps she can give him some  idea of the safest route for him to take. But no, the woman turns from  him in extreme agitation, refuses to answer his questions, and is so  evidently distressed at his appearance that he turns away and  withdraws to the veld to think. What now? What now?    He is sitting on the outskirts of the great bush-veld, that endless  stretch of forest-growth, dense and dark as far as the eye can reach.  Shall he enter that, unarmed, without provisions or water and totally  ignorant of the direction to take? He shudders. The blackness of the  night is creeping over the scene, and over his soul desolation and  despair.    \"I must return to the mission station,\" he decides at last. \"Surely  they will give me refuge for the night!\"    Slowly he drags his weary limbs across the veld, hesitatingly he  presents himself, falteringly he proffers his request. A moment's  hesitation and the family circle opens to receive him, its members  crowd round him with words of comfort and small deeds of love. They  are not doing _right_, but they will do _well_. Nothing is left undone  to restore and refresh the exhausted fugitive, who soon finds himself  in a perfect haven of domestic happiness and luxury.    As the evening wears on, the small harmonium is opened, and while the  younger members of the family are singing sweet part-songs together,  our hero turns over the leaves of a small book he has found lying on  the table, a book of German quotations. His eyes are attracted by the  following lines by Dessler:        Lenkst du durch Wusten meine Reise,      Ich folg, und lehne mich auf Dich      Du gibst mir aus der Wolken Speise      Und Traenkest aus dem Felsen mich,      Ich traue Deinen Wunderwegen,      Sie enden sich in Lieb und Segen,      Genug, wenn ich Dich bei mir hab.    They are like balm to his troubled soul, and he commits them to memory  for future use. God knows the future looks desperate enough to him,  for he feels that he cannot remain in this haven of rest.  Consideration for the safety of his kind friends forbids this. He soon  departs, having heard that, for the present at least, the western  direction is open to him, and, in taking this, his tribulations begin  afresh.    Unused to exercise as he has been during the long months of his  confinement, this traveller, in pursuing his course with so much  patience and steadfast determination, now finds himself hardly able to  walk. The tender feet are swollen and bleeding to such an extent that  he finds it impossible to remove his heavy boots. Halting, stumbling,  he continues on his way.    By good fortune he meets with another Kaffir guide, who leads him to a  small Kaffir hut and revives him with a draught of Kaffir beer. A few  moments' rest, and they are on the way again.    The day was far spent when they reached a Kaffir kraal, and here Mr.  Celliers sank down in agony of mind and body, too great for words.  More Kaffir beer was respectfully tendered to him and he drank it  gratefully, meanwhile watching with dull interest the Kaffir babies,  jet black and stark naked, except for a small fringe of blue beads  about the loins, as they crept around him, like so many playful  kittens.    He was not long allowed to rest, the good guide urging him to make a  final effort, and encouraging him with the assurance that he would  find a farm not far distant, the home of Mr. Piet Roos, of Krokodil  Poort.    This goal was reached that night, and a cordial welcome given to the  poor exhausted traveller, although he was warned that he could by no  means consider himself safe on the farm, as the British passed it  nearly every day. Nigh three weeks he spent there, taking refuge under  the trees of an adjacent hill by day and sleeping under the hospitable  roof by night. As time went on and the visits of the Khakis became  rarer, he became more at ease, and often worked with the farmer and  the women in the fields, helping them to dig sweet-potatoes, and  assisting his host in the work of sorting, drying, and rolling up the  leaves of the tobacco-plant. He also became an expert in the art of  making candles, and took active part in the other small industries  carried on in that frugal and industrious household, and the evenings  were spent in poring over maps, geographical and astronomical, which  his host happened to possess. Many were the questions put to him, and  long the discussions about worlds and suns and planets, while the busy  fingers plied and rolled tobacco leaves, but these discussions  generally ended in a sigh, a shake of the head, and an unbelieving,  \"there _must_ be something solid _under_ this earth,\" from the  sceptical host.    The time was now approaching for the fulfilment of his heart's  ambition, but there is still one small incident to relate before we  leave our hero. One day, while he was still on the farm, he was passed  by a Kaffir, whom he questioned as to his destination. The native  replied that he was on his way to Pretoria, and the happy thought  occurred to Mr. Celliers to ask this native to let his wife know that  her husband was in perfect safety.    Now the remarkable part of this incident was, that that unknown native  took the trouble to deliver his message faithfully and conscientiously,  and it was only after the war that Mr. Celliers heard from his wife  that she had received news of his successful escape from a strange  Kaffir, who said he had been sent by her husband. This is a striking  instance, well worth recording here, of the sagacity and fidelity of  some members of the heathen tribes.    It was on September 13th that unexpected deliverance came in the shape  of a Boer waggon in search of green forage for the horses on commando.  Mr. Celliers instantly decided to accompany the waggon back to the  lager, and prepared himself for departure that very day. Tender,  grateful leave was taken of the good friends who had harboured him so  long, and he drove away, seated, with his few worldly possessions  beside him, on the top of a load of green forage.    The next day he arrived at the lager of Commandant Badenhorst's  commando on the farm Waterval near the \"Sein koppies,\" and now we  close the chapter with the following words, which I have translated  from his diary:    \"The crown has been set on my undertaking. God be thanked, I find  myself again amongst free men, with weapon in hand. For the first time  in the past four months I feel myself secure. There is no one, on my  arrival, who gives one sign of interest or appreciation; one burgher  even asks me why I had not rather remained in Pretoria.    \"This stolid and philosophic view of life is characteristic of the  Boer and certainly does not discourage me.    \"Excitement and enthusiasm do not appear to be the children of the  great solitudes, the slumbering sunlit vastnesses; nay, rather do they  spring from the unbroken friction of many spirits, sparks bursting  from the anvil of the great, restlessly driven activity of the world.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Celliers remained in the field until the war was over.          CHAPTER X    A LITTLE ADVENTURE WITH THE BRITISH SOLDIER      The exquisite summer of 1901 was drawing to a close.    January and February had been months of unsurpassed splendour and  riotous luxury in fruit and flowers, each day being more gorgeous than  the last. The glorious sunsets, the mysterious and exquisitely  peaceful moonlight nights were a never-ending source of joy to our  young writer, thrilling her being with emotions not to be described.    Each morning at 5 o'clock, while the rest of the idiotic world lay  asleep within its cramped boundary of brick and stone, Hansie revelled  in the beauties of Nature, abandoning herself to at least one hour of  perfect bliss before the toil and trouble of another day could occupy  her mind.    The garden being so situated that its most secluded spots were far  removed from any sights and sounds which could remind one of the war,  Hansie had no difficulty in turning her thoughts into more uplifting  channels during the peaceful morning hour, spent, when the weather  permitted, in her favourite corner under"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#13)"],[1," if defying an army of invisible foes. \"He  would do this, that, and the other; he'd be d--d if he did not,\"--was  the usual form of his threats. Most of his leisure was spent in  walking, cursing and gesticulating, like one possessed by a demon. Most  evidently, he was a wretched man, at war with his own soul, and with  all the world around him. To be overheard by the children, disturbed him  very little. He made no more of our presence, than of that of the ducks  and geese which he met on the green. He little thought that the little  black urchins around him, could see, through those vocal crevices, the  very secrets of his heart. Slaveholders ever underrate the intelligence  with which{63 SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN} they have to  grapple. I really understood the old man's mutterings, attitudes and  gestures, about as well as he did himself. But slaveholders never  encourage that kind of communication, with the slaves, by which they  might learn to measure the depths of his knowledge. Ignorance is a high  virtue in a human chattel; and as the master studies to keep the slave  ignorant, the slave is cunning enough to make the master think he  succeeds. The slave fully appreciates the saying, \"where ignorance is  bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.\" When old master's gestures were violent,  ending with a threatening shake of the head, and a sharp snap of his  middle finger and thumb, I deemed it wise to keep at a respectable  distance from him; for, at such times, trifling faults stood, in  his eyes, as momentous offenses; and, having both the power and the  disposition, the victim had only to be near him to catch the punishment,  deserved or undeserved.    One of the first circumstances that opened my eyes to the cruelty and  wickedness of slavery, and the heartlessness of my old master, was the  refusal of the latter to interpose his authority, to protect and shield  a young woman, who had been most cruelly abused and beaten by his  overseer in Tuckahoe. This overseer--a Mr. Plummer--was a man like most  of his class, little better than a human brute; and, in addition to  his general profligacy and repulsive coarseness, the creature was a  miserable drunkard. He was, probably, employed by my old master, less  on account of the excellence of his services, than for the cheap rate at  which they could be obtained. He was not fit to have the management of  a drove of mules. In a fit of drunken madness, he committed the outrage  which brought the young woman in question down to my old master's for  protection. This young woman was the daughter of Milly, an own aunt  of mine. The poor girl, on arriving at our house, presented a pitiable  appearance. She had left in haste, and without preparation; and,  probably, without the knowledge of Mr. Plummer. She had traveled  twelve miles, bare-footed, bare-necked and bare-headed. Her neck and  shoulders{64} were covered with scars, newly made; and not content with  marring her neck and shoulders, with the cowhide, the cowardly brute had  dealt her a blow on the head with a hickory club, which cut a horrible  gash, and left her face literally covered with blood. In this condition,  the poor young woman came down, to implore protection at the hands of my  old master. I expected to see him boil over with rage at the revolting  deed, and to hear him fill the air with curses upon the brutual Plummer;  but I was disappointed. He sternly told her, in an angry tone, he  \"believed she deserved every bit of it,\" and, if she did not go home  instantly, he would himself take the remaining skin from her neck and  back. Thus was the poor girl compelled to return, without redress, and  perhaps to receive an additional flogging for daring to appeal to old  master against the overseer.    Old master seemed furious at the thought of being troubled by such  complaints. I did not, at that time, understand the philosophy of his  treatment of my cousin. It was stern, unnatural, violent. Had the man no  bowels of compassion? Was he dead to all sense of humanity? No. I think  I now understand it. This treatment is a part of the system, rather than  a part of the man. Were slaveholders to listen to complaints of this  sort against the overseers, the luxury of owning large numbers of  slaves, would be impossible. It would do away with the office of  overseer, entirely; or, in other words, it would convert the master  himself into an overseer. It would occasion great loss of time and  labor, leaving the overseer in fetters, and without the necessary power  to secure obedience to his orders. A privilege so dangerous as that of  appeal, is, therefore, strictly prohibited; and any one exercising it,  runs a fearful hazard. Nevertheless, when a slave has nerve enough  to exercise it, and boldly approaches his master, with a well-founded  complaint against an overseer, though he may be repulsed, and may even  have that of which he complains repeated at the time, and, though he may  be beaten by his master, as well as by the overseer, for his temerity,  in the end the{65} policy of complaining is, generally, vindicated by  the relaxed rigor of the overseer's treatment. The latter becomes more  careful, and less disposed to use the lash upon such slaves thereafter.  It is with this final result in view, rather than with any expectation  of immediate good, that the outraged slave is induced to meet his master  with a complaint. The overseer very naturally dislikes to have the  ear of the master disturbed by complaints; and, either upon this  consideration, or upon advice and warning privately given him by  his employers, he generally modifies the rigor of his rule, after an  outbreak of the kind to which I have been referring.    Howsoever the slaveholder may allow himself to act toward his slave,  and, whatever cruelty he may deem it wise, for example's sake, or for  the gratification of his humor, to inflict, he cannot, in the absence  of all provocation, look with pleasure upon the bleeding wounds of a  defenseless slave-woman. When he drives her from his presence without  redress, or the hope of redress, he acts, generally, from motives of  policy, rather than from a hardened nature, or from innate brutality.  Yet, let but his own temper be stirred, his own passions get loose, and  the slave-owner will go _far beyond_ the overseer in cruelty. He will  convince the slave that his wrath is far more terrible and boundless,  and vastly more to be dreaded, than that of the underling overseer. What  may have been mechanically and heartlessly done by the overseer, is now  done with a will. The man who now wields the lash is irresponsible.  He may, if he pleases, cripple or kill, without fear of consequences;  except in so far as it may concern profit or loss. To a man of  violent temper--as my old master was--this was but a very slender and  inefficient restraint. I have seen him in a tempest of passion, such  as I have just described--a passion into which entered all the bitter  ingredients of pride, hatred, envy, jealousy, and the thrist(sic) for  revenge.    The circumstances which I am about to narrate, and which gave rise to  this fearful tempest of passion, are not singular nor{66} isolated in  slave life, but are common in every slaveholding community in which I  have lived. They are incidental to the relation of master and slave, and  exist in all sections of slave-holding countries.    The reader will have noticed that, in enumerating the names of the  slaves who lived with my old master, _Esther_ is mentioned. This was a  young woman who possessed that which is ever a curse to the slave-girl;  namely--personal beauty. She was tall, well formed, and made a fine  appearance. The daughters of Col. Lloyd could scarcely surpass her in  personal charms. Esther was courted by Ned Roberts, and he was as fine  looking a young man, as she was a woman. He was the son of a favorite  slave of Col. Lloyd. Some slaveholders would have been glad to promote  the marriage of two such persons; but, for some reason or other, my old  master took it upon him to break up the growing intimacy between Esther  and Edward. He strictly ordered her to quit the company of said Roberts,  telling her that he would punish her severely if he ever found her again  in Edward's company. This unnatural and heartless order was, of course,  broken. A woman's love is not to be annihilated by the peremptory  command of any one, whose breath is in his nostrils. It was impossible  to keep Edward and Esther apart. Meet they would, and meet they did. Had  old master been a man of honor and purity, his motives, in this matter,  might have been viewed more favorably. As it was, his motives were as  abhorrent, as his methods were foolish and contemptible. It was too  evident that he was not concerned for the girl's welfare. It is one  of the damning characteristics of the slave system, that it robs its  victims of every earthly incentive to a holy life. The fear of God, and  the hope of heaven, are found sufficient to sustain many slave-women,  amidst the snares and dangers of their strange lot; but, this side of  God and heaven, a slave-woman is at the mercy of the power, caprice  and passion of her owner. Slavery provides no means for the honorable  continuance of the race. Marriage as imposing obligations on the parties  to it--has no{67 A HARROWING SCENE} existence here, except in such  hearts as are purer and higher than the standard morality around them.  It is one of the consolations of my life, that I know of many honorable  instances of persons who maintained their honor, where all around was  corrupt.    Esther was evidently much attached to Edward, and abhorred--as she had  reason to do--the tyrannical and base behavior of old master. Edward  was young, and fine looking, and he loved and courted her. He might have  been her husband, in the high sense just alluded to; but WHO and _what_  was this old master? His attentions were"]]]
