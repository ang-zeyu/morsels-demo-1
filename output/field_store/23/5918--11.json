Yet, in those daring hearts, the cheerless voice of boding Fear or dull  Despondency can find no answering tone, whether the storm, round the  snow-rampart[15] howling, interweaves his solemn moans with the  rejoicing shouts of the glad theatre,[16] or simple strains of homely  music leave that warm recess--vibrating far into the tremulous air.  Here, even here are pleasures; those stray[17] forms of joy, which  Nature spreads throughout the world, that he who seeks may find them.  When the Sun, uprising from his long and gloomy trance, beams through  the clearer air, how beautiful, in some obscurest dell[18] of that lone  land, led by the music of an unseen river to see fair flowers, with  light-awakened buds, salute the spring tide. Happily, they smile in the  midst of nakedness, like sweet memories of laughing infancy, beaming  around the desolation of an aged heart.    Oh, that the might of Man's majestic will were self-sufficing! that the  meaner chains which bind him to this dark, material world, before the  lightning glance of Enterprise might fade, as those Philistian bonds,  that fell from him of Zorah. Back--in sorrow back--the ocean-wanderers  turn the unwilling prow; for Nature may not yield, and all is lost, save  gloomy thoughts of unrequited toil in the storm-beaten deep; and  phantasies of gorgeous dreams, for ever desolate; and hopes, which were,  and will not be again.    Yet if the race of Man, as some have deemed[19], form but one mighty  Being, who doth live, yea with intenser life, while kingly Death benumbs  each separate atom with the touch of his pale sceptre--one unchanging  ocean of everchanging waves--one deathless heaven of clouds, which to  their graves roll ceaselessly: if it be so, not vainly have long years  sent forth their heralds on the trackless deep, where high endeavors of  exalted will which in themselves find no accomplishment, shall build at  length perfection. Peacefully he[20] sleeps, who erst beheld the rifted  shores of Greenland \"glister in the sun, like gold:\" and that deserted  chief[21] whose angry moan once mingled wildly with the screaming winds  and the hoarse gurgle of ingulfing waves, is unremembered now. But high  Emprise died not with them. Have not our latter days beheld, with awe,  the ice-borne Muscovite[22] ride the fierce billows of the Polar Sea?  Has not the Northern hunter seen the flag of England, o'er her floating  palaces, unfurled in his dominions crystalline? And who shall mourn,  while, in the mystic race, from hand to hand still moves the unquenched  torch, that none have reached the goal? Not suddenly doth the sweet  warmth of universal life, from brumal caves advancing, interfuse the  vast abysmal air, or penetrate the deep heart of the frost-entranced  Earth. Gentle, and in its very gentleness invincible, it moves, though  ruthlessly stern Winter calls his rallied armies on, and snow-blasts  violate the joyous prime. So is it, with the silent victories of Man's  enduring spirit: we have seen Winter and Spring; and shall we not behold  the full rejoicing of the complete year?    The hour shall come, nor shall the longing heart in that dark interval  be all unblest with glance prophetic. Though no meteor shape glare from  the speaking sky, no sheeted ghost wander dim-moving in the weird  midnight, with such forshadowings true as ever wait on him who, with a  calm and reverend eye, hath viewed the mysteries of things, and dared to  image forth the future from the past--bind on the mystic robe, and from  the brow of Hope's enchanted hill look boldly forth upon the coming  ages. Saw ye not white fog-wreaths floating through the cold gray dawn  over ice-laden billows, as they roll through yon rock-cinctured chasm? A  dusky shape looms through the hazy atmosphere, and sails, as of some  struggling bark that wearily breasts the opposing strength of angry  waves,[23] float with a fitful motion to and fro. Still on and on--a  breath-suspending sight of pale Solicitude, and fearful hope--and hark!  the triple crash of Britain's joy, the magical music of her wild hurra,  peals with a sound of mighty exultation through the aerial depths. The  cloven mist unwraps its folded canopy, and lo! the blue Pacific,  boundlessly outspread, far glitters in the silvery light of morn.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] Columbus.

The \"Leaves from the Portfolio of a Manager,\" in the December _Dublin  University Magazine_, disclose a number of interesting facts connected  with Prynne's \"Histriomastix,\" Milton's \"Samson Agonistes,\" Hannah  More's \"Tragedies,\" Ireland's \"Shakspeare Forgeries,\" and not a few very  startling disclosures respecting the extraordinary emoluments of first  class performers, from Roscius down to Jenny Lind. From this portion of  our Manager's Portfolio we select the amusing recollections of Paganini  in Ireland, twenty years ago:    \"Catalani, Pasta, Sontag, Malibran, Grisi, Taglioni, Rubini, Mario,  Tamburini, Lablache, _cum multis aliis_, have received their thousands,  and tens of thousands: but, until the Jenny Lind mania left every thing  else at an immeasurable distance, Paganini obtained larger sums than had  ever before been received in modern times. He came with a prodigious  flourish of trumpets, a vast continental reputation, and a few personal  legends of the most exciting character. It was said that he had killed  his wife in a fit of jealousy, and made fiddlestrings of her intestines;  and that the devil had composed a sonata for him in a dream, as he  formerly did for Tartini. When you looked at him, you thought all this,  and more, very likely to be true. His talent was almost supernatural,  while his 'get up,' and 'mise en scene,' were original and unearthly,  such as those who saw him will never forget, and those who did not can  with difficulty conceive. The individual and his performance were  equally unlike anything that had ever been exhibited before. No picture  or description can convey an adequate idea of his entrance and his exit.  To walk simply on and off the stage appears a commonplace operation  enough, but Paganini did this in a manner peculiar to himself, which  baffled all imitation. While I am writing of it, his first appearance in  Dublin, at the great Musical Festival of 1830, presents itself to 'my  mind's eye,' as an event of yesterday. When he placed himself in  position to commence, the crowded audience were hushed into a deathlike  silence. His black habiliments; his pale, attenuated visage, powerfully  expressive; his long, silky, raven tresses, and the flash of his dark  eye, as he shook them back over his shoulders; his thin, transparent  fingers, unusually long; the mode in which he grasped his bow, and the  tremendous length to which he drew it; and, climax of all, his sudden  manner of placing both bow and instrument under his arm, while he threw  his hands behind him, elevated his head, his features almost distorted  with a smile of ecstasy, and his very hair instinct with life, at the  conclusion of an unparalleled fantasia! And there he stood, immovable  and triumphant, while the theatre rang again with peals on peals of  applause, and shouts of the wildest enthusiasm! None who witnessed this  will ever forget it, nor are they likely again to see the same effect  produced by mere mortal agency.    \"The _one_ string feat I always considered unworthy this great master of  his art. It has been done by fifty others, and is at best but an  imperfect exhibition on a perfect instrument; a mere piece of  charlatanerie, or theatrical 'gag,' to use a professional term,  sufficiently intelligible. There have been, and _are_, mighty musicians  on the violin. Spagnoletti, De Beriot, Ole Bull (who according to some  plays without any string at all), Sivori, Joachim, Ernst, Levey, &c.  &c., are all in the list of great players; but there never was more than  one Paganini; he is unique and unapproachable.    \"In Dublin, in 1830, Paganini saved the Musical Festival, which would  have failed but for his individual attraction, although supported by an  army of talent in every department. All was done in first-rate style,  not to be surpassed. There were Braham, Madame Stockhausen, H. Phillips,  De Begnis, &c. &c., Sir G. Smart for conductor, Cramer, Mori, and T.  Cooke for leaders, Lindley, Nicholson, Anfossi, Lidel Hermann, Pigott,  and above ninety musicians in the orchestra, and more than one hundred  and twenty singers in the chorus.

Et nunc ille Paris cum semiviro comitatu,    Maeonia mentum mitra crinemque madentem    subnexus, rapto potitur:  nos munera templis    quippe tuis ferimus, famamque fovemus inanem.'      Talibus orantem dictis arasque tenentem    audiit omnipotens, oculosque ad moenia torsit    regia et oblitos famae melioris amantes.    Tum sic Mercurium adloquitur ac talia mandat:    'Vade age, nate, voca Zephyros et labere pennis,    Dardaniumque ducem, Tyria Karthagine qui nunc    exspectat, fatisque datas non respicit urbes,    adloquere, et celeris defer mea dicta per auras.    Non illum nobis genetrix pulcherrima talem    promisit, Graiumque ideo bis vindicat armis;    sed fore, qui gravidam imperiis belloque frementem    Italiam regeret, genus alto a sanguine Teucri    proderet, ac totum sub leges mitteret orbem.    Si nulla accendit tantarum gloria rerum,    nec super ipse sua molitur laude laborem,    Ascanione pater Romanas invidet arces?    Quid struit, aut qua spe inimica in gente moratur,    nec prolem Ausoniam et Lavinia respicit arva?    Naviget:  haec summa est; hic nostri nuntius esto.'      Dixerat.  Ille patris magni parere parabat    imperio; et primum pedibus talaria nectit    aurea, quae sublimem alis sive aequora supra    seu terram rapido pariter cum flamine portant;    tum virgam capit:  hac animas ille evocat Orco    pallentis, alias sub Tartara tristia mittit,    dat somnos adimitque, et lumina morte resignat.    Illa fretus agit ventos, et turbida tranat    nubila; iamque volans apicem et latera ardua cernit    Atlantis duri, caelum qui vertice fulcit,    Atlantis, cinctum adsidue cui nubibus atris    piniferum caput et vento pulsatur et imbri;    nix umeros infusa tegit; tum flumina mento    praecipitant senis, et glacie riget horrida barba.    Hic primum paribus nitens Cyllenius alis    constitit; hinc toto praeceps se corpore ad undas    misit, avi similis, quae circum litora, circum    piscosos scopulos humilis volat aequora iuxta.    Haud aliter terras inter caelumque volabat,    litus harenosum Libyae ventosque secabat    materno veniens ab avo Cyllenia proles.    Ut primum alatis tetigit magalia plantis,    Aenean fundantem arces ac tecta novantem    conspicit; atque illi stellatus iaspide fulva    ensis erat, Tyrioque ardebat murice laena    demissa ex umeris, dives quae munera Dido    fecerat, et tenui telas discreverat auro.    Continuo invadit:  'Tu nunc Karthaginis altae    fundamenta locas, pulchramque uxorius urbem    exstruis, heu regni rerumque oblite tuarum?    Ipse deum tibi me claro demittit Olympo    regnator, caelum ac terras qui numine torquet;    ipse haec ferre iubet celeris mandata per auras:    quid struis, aut qua spe Libycis teris otia terris?    Si te nulla movet tantarum gloria rerum,    [nec super ipse tua moliris laude laborem,]    Ascanium surgentem et spes heredis Iuli    respice, cui regnum Italiae Romanaque tellus    debentur.'  Tali Cyllenius ore locutus    mortalis visus medio sermone reliquit,    et procul in tenuem ex oculis evanuit auram.      At vero Aeneas aspectu obmutuit amens,    arrectaeque horrore comae, et vox faucibus haesit.    Ardet abire fuga dulcisque relinquere terras,    attonitus tanto monitu imperioque deorum.    Heu quid agat?  Quo nunc reginam ambire furentem    audeat adfatu?  Quae prima exordia sumat?    Atque animum nunc huc celerem, nunc dividit illuc,    in partisque rapit varias perque omnia versat.    Haec alternanti potior sententia visa est:    Mnesthea Sergestumque vocat fortemque Serestum,    classem aptent taciti sociosque ad litora cogant,    arma parent, et quae rebus sit causa novandis    dissimulent; sese interea, quando optuma Dido    nesciat et tantos rumpi non speret amores,    temptaturum aditus, et quae mollissima fandi    tempora, quis rebus dexter modus.  Ocius omnes    imperio laeti parent ac iussa facessunt.      At regina dolos---quis fallere possit amantem?    praesensit, motusque excepit prima futuros,    omnia tuta timens.  Eadem impia Fama furenti    detulit armari classem cursumque parari.    Saevit inops animi, totamque incensa per urbem    bacchatur, qualis commotis excita sacris    Thyias, ubi audito stimulant trieterica Baccho    orgia, nocturnusque vocat clamore Cithaeron.    Tandem his Aenean compellat vocibus ultro:    'Dissimulare etiam sperasti, perfide, tantum    posse nefas, tacitusque mea decedere terra?    Nec te noster amor, nec te data dextera quondam,    nec moritura tenet crudeli funere Dido?    Quin etiam hiberno moliris sidere classem,    et mediis properas aquilonibus ire per altum,    crudelis?  Quid, si non arva aliena domosque    ignotas peteres, sed Troia antiqua maneret,    Troia per undosum peteretur classibus aequor    Mene fugis?  Per ego has lacrimas dextramque tuam te    (quando aliud mihi iam miserae nihil ipsa reliqui)    per conubia nostra, per inceptos hymenaeos,    si bene quid de te merui, fuit aut tibi quicquam    dulce meum, miserere domus labentis, et istam---    oro, si quis adhuc precibus locus---exue mentem.    Te propter Libycae gentes Nomadumque tyranni    odere, infensi Tyrii; te propter eundem    exstinctus pudor, et, qua sola sidera adibam,    fama prior.  Cui me moribundam deseris, hospes?    Hoc solum nomen quoniam de coniuge restat.    Quid moror?  An mea Pygmalion dum moenia frater    destruat, aut captam ducat Gaetulus Iarbas?    Saltem si qua mihi de te suscepta fuisset    ante fugam suboles, si quis mihi parvulus aula    luderet Aeneas, qui te tamen ore referret,    non equidem omnino capta ac deserta viderer.'      Dixerat.  Ille Iovis monitis immota tenebat    lumina, et obnixus curam sub corde premebat.    Tandem pauca refert:  'Ego te, quae plurima fando    enumerare vales, numquam, regina, negabo    promeritam; nec me meminisse pigebit Elissae,    dum memor ipse mei, dum spiritus hos regit artus.    Pro re pauca loquar.  Neque ego hanc abscondere furto    speravi---ne finge---fugam, nec coniugis umquam    praetendi taedas, aut haec in foedera veni.    Me si fata meis paterentur ducere vitam    auspiciis et sponte mea componere curas,    urbem Troianam primum dulcisque meorum    reliquias colerem, Priami tecta alta manerent,    et recidiva manu posuissem Pergama victis.    Sed nunc Italiam magnam Gryneus Apollo,    Italiam Lyciae iussere capessere sortes:    hic amor, haec patria est.  Si te Karthaginis arces,    Phoenissam, Libycaeque aspectus detinet urbis,    quae tandem, Ausonia Teucros considere terra,    invidia est?  Et nos fas extera quaerere regna.    Me patris Anchisae, quotiens umentibus umbris    nox operit terras, quotiens astra ignea surgunt,    admonet in somnis et turbida terret imago;    me puer Ascanius capitisque iniuria cari,    quem regno Hesperiae fraudo et fatalibus arvis.    Nunc etiam interpres divom, Iove missus ab ipso---    testor utrumque caput---celeris mandata per auras    detulit; ipse deum manifesto in lumine vidi    intrantem muros, vocemque his auribus hausi.    Desine meque tuis incendere teque querelis:    Italiam non sponte sequor.'      Talia dicentem iamdudum aversa tuetur,    huc illuc volvens oculos, totumque pererrat    luminibus tacitis, et sic accensa profatur:    'Nec tibi diva parens, generis nec Dardanus auctor,    perfide; sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens    Caucasus, Hyrcanaeque admorunt ubera tigres.    Nam quid dissimulo, aut quae me ad maiora reservo?    Num fletu ingemuit nostro?  Num lumina flexit?    Num lacrimas victus dedit, aut miseratus amantem est?    Quae quibus anteferam?  Iam iam nec maxuma Iuno,    nec Saturnius haec oculis pater aspicit aequis.    Nusquam tuta fides.  Eiectum litore, egentem    excepi, et regni demens in parte locavi;    amissam classem, socios a morte reduxi.    Heu furiis incensa feror! Nunc augur Apollo,    nunc Lyciae sortes, nunc et Iove missus ab ipso    interpres divom fert horrida iussa per auras.    Scilicet is Superis labor est, ea cura quietos    sollicitat.  Neque te teneo, neque dicta refello.    I, sequere Italiam ventis, pete regna per undas.    Spero equidem mediis, si quid pia numina possunt,    supplicia hausurum scopulis, et nomine Dido    saepe vocaturum.  Sequar atris ignibus absens,    et, cum frigida mors anima seduxerit artus,    omnibus umbra locis adero.  Dabis, improbe, poenas.    Audiam et haec Manis veniet mihi fama sub imos.'    His medium dictis sermonem abrumpit, et auras    aegra fugit, seque ex oculis avertit et aufert,    linquens multa metu cunctantem et multa parantem    dicere.  Suscipiunt famulae, conlapsaque membra    marmoreo referunt thalamo stratisque reponunt.      At pius Aeneas, quamquam lenire dolentem    solando cupit et dictis avertere curas,    multa gemens magnoque animum labefactus amore,    iussa tamen divom exsequitur, classemque revisit.    Tum vero Teucri incumbunt, et litore celsas    deducunt toto naves:  natat uncta carina;    frondentisque ferunt remos et robora silvis    infabricata, fugae studio.    Migrantis cernas, totaque ex urbe ruentis.    Ac velut ingentem formicae farris acervum    cum populant, hiemis memores, tectoque reponunt;    it nigrum campis agmen, praedamque per herbas    convectant calle angusto; pars grandia trudunt    obnixae frumenta umeris; pars agmina cogunt    castigantque moras; opere omnis semita fervet.    Quis tibi tum, Dido, cernenti talia sensus?    quosve dabas gemitus, cum litora fervere late    prospiceres arce ex summa, totumque videres    misceri ante oculos tantis clamoribus aequor?    Improbe Amor, quid non mortalia pectora cogis?    Ire iterum in lacrimas, iterum temptare precando    cogitur, et supplex animos submittere amori,    ne quid inexpertum frustra moritura relinquat.      'Anna, vides toto properari litore; circum    undique convenere; vocat iam carbasus auras,    puppibus et laeti nautae imposuere coronas.    Hunc ego si potui tantum sperare dolorem,    et perferre, soror, potero.  Miserae hoc tamen"]]]
