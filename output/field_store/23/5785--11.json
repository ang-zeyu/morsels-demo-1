Luxury  is a quality more or less consulted by every one who builds for his  _own_ occupation on a farm, or elsewhere; and the tendency in building  is constantly to expand, to give a higher finish, and in fact, to  over-build. Indeed, if we were to draw the balance, on our _old_ farms,  between scantily-accommodated houses, and houses with needless room in  them, the latter would preponderate. Not that these latter houses either  are too good, or too convenient for the purpose for which they were  built, but they have _too much_ room, and that room badly appropriated  and arranged.    On a farm proper, the whole establishment is a _workshop_. The shop _out  of doors_, we acknowledge, is not always _dry_, nor always warm; but it  is exceedingly well aired and lighted, and a place where industrious  people dearly love to labor. Within doors it is a work-shop too. There  is always labor and occupation for the family, in the _general business_  of the farm; therefore but little room is wanted for either luxury or  leisure, and the farm house should be fully occupied, with the  exception, perhaps, of a single room on the main floor, (and that not a  large one,) for some regular business purpose. All these accommodated,  and the requirements of the house are ended. Owners of _rented_ farms  should reflect, too, that expensive houses on their estates entail  expensive repairs, and that continually. Many tenants are careless of  highly-finished houses. Not early accustomed to them, they  misappropriate, perhaps, the best rooms in the house, and pay little  attention to the purposes for which the owner designed them, or to the  _manner_ of using them. It is therefore a total waste of money to build  a house on a tenant estate anything beyond the mere comfortable wants of  the family occupying it, and to furnish the room necessary for the  accommodation of the crops, stock, and farm furniture, in the barns and  other out-buildings--all in a cheap, tidy, yet substantial way.    So, too, with the grounds for domestic purposes around the house. A  kitchen garden, sufficient to grow the family vegetables--a few plain  fruits--a _posey_ bed or two for the girls--and the story is told. Give  a larger space for these things--anything indeed, for elegance--and ten  to one, the plow is introduced, a corn or potato patch is _set out_,  field culture is adopted, and your choice grounds are torn up, defaced,  and sacrificed to the commonest uses.    Notwithstanding these drawbacks, a cheerful, home-expression may be  given, and should be given to the homestead, in the character and  construction of the buildings, be they ever so rough and homely. We can  call to mind many instances of primitive houses-_log_ cabins even--built  when none better could be had, that presented a most comfortable and  life-enjoying picture--residences once, indeed, of those who swayed \"the  applause of listening senates,\" but under the hands of taste, and a  trifle of labor, made to look comfortable, happy, and sufficient. We  confess, therefore, to a profound veneration, if not affection, for the  humble farm house, as truly American in character; and which, with a  moderate display of skill, may be made equal to the main purposes of  life and enjoyment for all such as do not aspire to a high display, and  who are content to make the most of moderate means.          DESIGN II.      This is the plan of a house and out-buildings based chiefly on one which  we built of wood some years since on a farm of our own, and which, in  its occupation, has proved to be one of exceeding convenience to the  purposes intended. As a farm _business_ house, we have not known it  excelled; nor in the ease and facility of doing up the house-work within  it, do we know a better. It has a subdued, quiet, unpretending look; yet  will accommodate a family of a dozen workmen, besides the females  engaged in the household work, with perfect convenience; or if occupied  by a farmer with but his own family around him, ample room is afforded  them for a most comfortable mode of life, and sufficient for the  requirements of a farm of two, to three or four hundred acres.      [Illustration: FARM HOUSE. Pages 85-86]    This house is, in the main body, 36x22 feet, one and a half stories  high, with a projection on the rear 34x16 feet, for the kitchen and its  offices; and a still further addition to that, of 26x18 feet, for  wash-room. The main body of the house is 14 feet high to the plates; the  lower rooms are 9 feet high; the roof has a pitch of 35deg from a  horizontal line, giving partially-upright chambers in the main building,  and _roof_ lodging rooms in the rear. The rear, or kitchen part, is one  story high, with 10 feet posts, and such pitch of roof (which last runs  at right angles to the main body, and laps on to the main roof,) as will  carry the peak up to the same air line. This addition should retreat 6  inches from the line of the main building, on the side given in the  design, and 18 inches on the rear. The rooms on this kitchen floor are 8  feet high, leaving one foot above the upper floor, under the roof, as a  chamber garret, or lumber-room, as may be required. Beyond this, in the  rear, is the other extension spoken of, with posts 9 feet high, for a  buttery, closet, or dairy, or all three combined, and a wash-room; the  floor of which is on a level with the last, and the roof running in the  same direction, and of the same pitch. In front of this wash-room, where  not covered by the wood-house, is an open porch, 8 feet wide and 10 feet  long, the roof of which runs out at a less angle than the others--say  30deg from a horizontal line. Attached to this is the wood-house,  running off by way of L, at right angles, 36x16 feet, of same height  as the wash-room.    Adjoining the wood-house, on the same front line, is a building 50x20  feet, with 12 feet posts, occupied as a workshop, wagon-house, stable,  and store-room, with a lean-to on the last of 15x10 feet, for a piggery.  The several rooms in this building are 8 feet high, affording a good  lumber room over the workshop, and hay storage over the wagon-house and  stable. Over the wagon-house is a gable, with a blind window swinging on  hinges, for receiving hay, thus relieving the long, uniform line of  roof, and affording ample accommodation on each side to a pigeon-house  or dovecote, if required.    The style of this establishment is of plain Italian, or bracketed, and  may be equally applied to stone, brick, or wood. The roofs are broad,  and protect the walls by their full projection over them, 2-1/2 feet.  The small gable in the front roof of the main dwelling relieves it of  its otherwise straight uniformity, and affords a high door-window  opening on to the deck of the veranda, which latter should be 8 or 10  feet in width. The shallow windows, also, over the wings of the veranda  give it a more cheerful expression. The lower _end_ windows of this part  of the house are hooded, or sheltered by a cheap roof, which gives them  a snug and most comfortable appearance. The veranda may appear more  ornamental than the plain character of the house requires; but any  superfluous work upon it may be omitted, and the style of finish  conformed to the other. The veranda roof is flatter than that of the  house, but it may be made perfectly tight by closer shingling, and  paint; while the deck or platform in the centre may be roofed with zinc,  or tin, and a coat of sanded paint laid upon it. The front chimney is  plain, yet in keeping with the general style of the house, and may be  made of ordinary bricks. The two parts of the chimney, as they appear in  the front rooms, are drawn together as they pass through the chamber  above, and become one at the roof. The kitchen chimneys pass up through  the peaks of their respective roofs, and should be in like character  with the other.      [Illustration: CHAMBER PLAN. GROUND PLAN.]      INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT.    The front door of this house opens into a small entry or hall, 9x6 feet,  which is lighted by a low sash of glass over the front door. A door  leads into a room on each side; and at the inner end of the hall is a  recess between the two chimneys of the opposite rooms, in which may be  placed a table or broad shelf to receive hats and coats. On the left is  a parlor 22x15 feet, lighted on one side by a double window, and in  front by a single plain one. The fireplace is centrally placed on one  side of the room, in the middle of the house. On one side of the  fireplace is a closet, three feet deep, with shelves, and another closet  at the inner end of the room, near the kitchen door; or this closet may  be dispensed with for the use of this parlor, and given up to enlarge  the closet which is attached to the bedroom. Another door opens directly  into the kitchen. This parlor is 9 feet high between joints. The  sitting-room is opposite to the parlor, 19x15 feet, and lighted and  closeted in nearly the same manner, as will be seen by referring to the  floor plan.    The kitchen is the grand room of this house. It is 24x16 feet in area,  having an ample fireplace, with its hooks and trammels, and a spacious  oven by its side. It is lighted by a double window at one end, and a  single window near the fireplace. At one end of this kitchen is a most  comfortable and commodious family bedroom, 13x10 feet, with a large  closet in one corner, and lighted by a window in the side. Two windows  may be inserted if wanted. A passage leads by the side of the oven to a  sink-room, or recess, behind the chimney, with shelves to dry dishes on,  and lighted by the half of a double window, which accommodates with its  other half the dairy, or closet adjoining. A door also opens from this  recess into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#13)"],[1,"us to identify the grand cruciform church (A), the  cloister-court with the chapterhouse (B), the refectory (I),  the kitchen-court with its offices (K, O, O) and the other  principal apartments.  The infirmary has perished completely.    Some Benedictine houses display exceptional arrangements,  dependent upon local circumstances, e.g. the dormitory of  Worcester runs from east to west, from the west walk of the  cloister, and that of Durham is built over the west, instead of                                 FIG. 4     St Mary's Abbey, York (Benedictine).--Churton's Monnastic Ruins.

The history of monasticism is one of alternate periods of  decay and revival.  With growth in popular esteem came increase  in material wealth, leading to luxury and worldliness.  The  first religious ardour cooled, the strictness of the rule was  relaxed, until by the 10th century the decay of discipline  was so complete in France that the monks are said to have  been frequently unacquainted with the rule of St Benedict,  and even ignorant that they were bound by any rule at  all.  The reformation of abuses generally took the form of  the establishment of new monastic orders, with new and more  stringent rules, requiring a modification of the architectural  arrangements.  One of the earliest of these reformed orders  was the Cluniac. This order took its name from,the little  village of Cluny, 12 miles N.W. of Macon, near which, about  A.D. 909, a reformed Benedictine abbey was founded by William,  duke of Aquitaine and count of Auvergne, under Berno, abbot of  Beaume.  He was succeeded by Odo, who is often regarded as  the founder of the order.  The fame of Cluny spread far and  wide.  Its rigid rule was adopted by a vast number of the  old Benedictine abbeys, who placed themselves in affiliation  to the mother society, while new foundations sprang up in  large numbers, all owing allegiance to the ``archabbot,''  established at Cluny.  By the end of the 12th century the  number of monasteries affiliated to Cluny in the various  countries of western Europe amounted to 2000.  The monastic  establishment of Cluny was one of the most extensive  and magnificent in France.  We may form some idea of its  enormous dimensions from the fact recorded, that when, A.D.  1245, Pope Innocent IV., accompanied by twelve cardinals,             FIG. 5--Abbey of Cluny, from       A.

Guest-house.      a patriarch, three archbishops, the two generals of the  Carthusians and Cistercians, the king (St Louis), and three  of his sons, the queen mother, Baldwin, count of Flanders  and emperor of Constantinople, the duke of Burgundy, and  six lords, visited the abbey, the whole party, with their  attendants, were lodged withn the monastery without disarranging  the monks, 400 in number.  Nearly the whole of the abbey  buildings, including the magnificent church, were swept away  at the close of the 18th century.  When the annexed ground-plan  was taken, shortly before its destruction, nearly all the  monastery, with the exception of the church, had been rebuilt.    The church, the ground-plan of which bears a remarkable  resemblance to that of Lincoln Cathedral, was of vast  dimensions.  It was 656 ft. high.  The nave (G) had double  vaulted aisles on either side.  Like Lincoln, it had an  eastern as well as a western transept, each furnished with  apsidal chapels to the east.  The western transept was 213  ft. long, and the eastern 123 ft.  The choir terminated in  a semicircular apse (F), surrounded by five chapels, also  semicircular.  The western entrance was approached by an  ante-church, or narthex (B), itself an aisled church of  no mean dimensions, flanked by two towers, rising from a  stately flight of steps bearing a large stone cross.  To the  south of the church lay the cloister-court (H), of immense  size, placed much farther to the west than is usually the  case.  On the south side of the cloister stood the refectory  (P), an immense building, 100 ft. long and 60 ft. wide,  accommodating six longitudinal and three transverse rows of  tables.  It was adorned with the portraits of the chief  benefactors of the abbey, and with Scriptural subjects.  The  end wall displayed the Last Judgment.  We are unhappily unable  to identify any other of the principal buildings (N). The  abbot's residence (K), still partly standing, adjoined the  entrance-gate.  The guest-house (L) was close by.  The bakehouse  (M), also remaining, is a detached building of immense size.    English Cluniac    The first English house of the Cluniac order was that of  Lewes, founded by the earl of Warren, c. A.D. 1077.  Of  this only a few fragments of the domestic buildings exist.  The best preserved Cluniac houses in England are Castle Acre,  Norfolk, and Wenlock, Shropshire.  Ground-plans of both are  given in Britton's Architectural Antiquities. They show  several departures from the Benedictine arrangement.  In  each the prior's house is remarkably perfect.  All Cluniac  houses in England were French colonies, governed by priors  of that nation.  They did not secure their independence nor  become ``abbeys'' till the reign of Henry VI. The Cluniac  revival, with all its brilliancy, was but short-lived.  The celebrity of this, as of other orders, worked its moral  ruin.  With their growth in wealth and dignity the Cluniac  foundations became as worldly in life and as relaxed in  discipline as their predecessors, and a fresh reform was needed.    Cistercian    The next great monastic revival, the Cistercian, arising in  the last years of the 11th century, had a wider diffusion,  and a longer and more honourable existence.  Owing its real  origin, as a distinct foundation of reformed Benedictines, in  the year 1098, to Stephen Harding (a native of Dorsetshire,  educated in the monastery of Sherborne), and deriving its  name from Citeaux (Cistercium), a desolate and almost  inaccessible forest solitude, on the borders of Champagne and  Burgundy, the rapid growth and wide celebrity of the order  are undoubtedly to be attributed to the enthusiastic piety  of St Bernard, abbot of the first of the monastic colonies,  subsequently sent forth in such quick succession by the  first Cistercian houses, the far-famed abbey of Clairvaux  (de Clara Valle), A.D. 1116.  The rigid self-abnegation,  which was the ruling principle of this reformed congregation  of the Benedictine order, extended itself to the churches and  other buildings erected by them.  The characteristic of the  Cistercian abbeys was the extremest simplicity and a studied  plainness.  Only one tower--a central one --was permitted, and  that was to be very low.  Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets  were prohibited.  The triforium was omitted.  The windows  were to be plain and undivided, and it was forbidden to  decorate them with stained glass.  All needless ornament was  proscribed.  The crosses must be of wood; the candlesticks of  iron.  The renunciation of the world was to be evidenced  in all that met the eye.  The same spirit manifested itself  in the choice of the sites of their monasteries.  The more  dismal, the more savage, the more hopeless a spot appeared,  the more did it please their rigid mood.  But they came  not merely as ascetics, but as improvers.  The Cistercian  monasteries are, as a rule, found placed in deep well-watered  valleys.  They always stand on the border of a stream; not  rarely, as at Fountains, the buildings extend over it.  These  valleys, now so rich and productive, wore a very different  aspect when the brethren first chose them as the place of their  retirement.  Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets,  wild impassable forests, were their prevailing features.  The  ``bright valley,'' Clara Vallis of St Bernard, was known  as the ``valley of Wormwood,'' infamous as a den of robbers.  ``It was a savage dreary solitude, so utterly barren that  at first Bernard and his companions were reduced to live on  beech leaves.''-(Milman's Lat. Christ. vol. iii. p. 335.)    Clairvaux    All Cistercian monasteries, unless the circumstances of the  locality forbade it, were arranged according to one plan.  The  general arrangement and distribution of the various  buildings, which went to make up one of these vast  establishments, may be gathered from that of St Bernard's own  abbey of Clairvaux, which is here given.  It will be observed  that the abbey precincts are surrounded by a strong wall,  furnished at intervals with watch-towers and other defensive  works.  The wall is nearly encircled by a stream of water,  artificially diverted from the small rivulets which flow  through the precincts, furnishing the establishment with  an abundant supply in every part, for the litigation of  the gardens and orchards, the sanitary requirements of the  brotherhood and for the use of the offices and workshops.    The precincts are divided across the centre by a wall,  running from N. to S., into an outer and "]]]
