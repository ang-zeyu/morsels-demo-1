[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#13)"],[1,"  murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart  would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. And when,  released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes eloquent,  his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion remained  without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim, \"God! you can  all but speak!\"    Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would  often seize Thornton's hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the  flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as  Buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this  feigned bite for a caress.    For the most part, however, Buck's love was expressed in adoration.  While he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to  him, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove  her nose under Thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,  who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton's knee, Buck was  content to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert,  at Thornton's feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it, studying  it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression, every  movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he would lie  farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of the man and  the occasional movements of his body. And often, such was the communion  in which they lived, the strength of Buck's gaze would draw John  Thornton's head around, and he would return the gaze, without speech,  his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck's heart shone out.    For a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out  of his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it  again, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he  had come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could  be permanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as  Perrault and Francois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in  the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times  he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of  the tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master's  breathing.    But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed  to bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,  which the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.  Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet  he retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come  in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire, rather than a dog  of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of  civilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from  this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate  an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape  detection.    His face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he  fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too  good-natured for quarrelling,--besides, they belonged to John Thornton;  but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly  acknowledged Buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with  a terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well the  law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back  from a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned from  Spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew  there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while to show  mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial life. It was  misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for death. Kill  or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, down out  of the depths of Time, he obeyed.    He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He  linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed  through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and  seasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton's fire, a broad-breasted dog,  white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all  manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,  tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,  scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the  sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,  directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,  and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff  of his dreams.    So peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and  the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a  call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously  thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire  and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on  and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the  call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he gained  the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John Thornton  drew him back to the fire again.    Thornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance  travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all,  and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When  Thornton's partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,  Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton;  after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors  from them as though he favored them by accepting. They were of the same  large type as Thornton, living close to the earth, thinking simply and  seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the  saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his ways, and did not  insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig.    For Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone among  men, could put a pack upon Buck's back in the summer travelling. Nothing  was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day (they had  grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson  for the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting on the  crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three  hundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the edge, Buck at his  shoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he drew the attention  of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind. \"Jump, Buck!\" he  commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm. The next instant he  was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while Hans and Pete were  dragging them back into safety.    \"It's uncanny,\" Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their  speech.    Thornton shook his head. \"No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.  Do you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.\"    \"I'm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he's  around,\" Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.    \"Py Jingo!\" was Hans's contribution. \"Not mineself either.\"    It was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete's apprehensions  were realized. \"Black\" Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had  been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton  stepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a  corner, head on paws, watching his master's every action. Burton struck  out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent  spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of  the bar.    Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a  something which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck's body  rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton's throat. The man  saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled  backward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth  from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time  the man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn open.  Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a surgeon  checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling furiously,  attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of hostile  clubs. A \"miners' meeting,\" called on the spot, decided that the dog had  sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his reputation was  made, and from that day his name spread through every camp in Alaska.    Later on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton's life in  quite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow  poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans  and Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from  tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent  by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the  bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off  his master.    At a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks  jutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton  poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in  his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,  and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when  Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat flirted  over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton, flung sheer  out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids,  a stretch of wild water in which no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (#13)"],[1,"successively to Daras, a city on the       confines of Persia; to the island of Lipari; and to Beneventum.
