I had a great  respect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had  the same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we were  both very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought most  prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as a  marriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my  return, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business.  Perhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I  imagined them to be.    My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph  Watson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading.  The two first were  clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles  Brogden; the other was clerk to a merchant.  Watson was a pious,  sensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in  their principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as  Collins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.  Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his  friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticising.  Ralph was  ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I  never knew a prettier talker.  Both of them great admirers of poetry,  and began to try their hands in little pieces.  Many pleasant walks we  four had together on Sundays into the woods, near Schuylkill, where we  read to one another, and conferr'd on what we read.    Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he  might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that  the best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many  faults as he did.  Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius  for poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he  was bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he  might, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to  employment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his  own account.  I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and  then, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther.    On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next meeting,  produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by our mutual  observations, criticisms, and corrections.  As language and expression  were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of invention  by agreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth Psalm,  which describes the descent of a Deity.  When the time of our meeting  drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was  ready.  I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination, had  done nothing.  He then show'd me his piece for my opinion, and I much  approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit.  \"Now,\" says he,  \"Osborne never will allow the least merit in any thing of mine, but  makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy.  He is not so jealous of you; I  wish, therefore, you would take this piece, and produce it as yours; I  will pretend not to have had time, and so produce nothing.  We shall  then see what he will say to it.\" It was agreed, and I immediately  transcrib'd it, that it might appear in my own hand.    We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it,  but many defects.  Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did it  justice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties.  He himself  had nothing to produce.  I was backward; seemed desirous of being  excused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse  could be admitted; produce I must.  It was read and repeated; Watson  and Osborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it.  Ralph  only made some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but I defended  my text.  Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no better a  critic than poet, so he dropt the argument.  As they two went home  together, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of  what he thought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as he  said, lest I should think it flattery.  \"But who would have imagin'd,\"  said he, \"that Franklin had been capable of such a performance; such  painting, such force, such fire!  He has even improv'd the original.  In his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words; he  hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he writes!\" When we next  met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him, and Osborne was a  little laught at.    This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet.  I  did all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling  verses till Pope cured him.  He became, however, a pretty good prose  writer.  More of him hereafter.  But, as I may not have occasion again  to mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson died in  my arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best of our set.  Osborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminent lawyer and  made money, but died young.  He and I had made a serious agreement,  that the one who happen'd first to die should, if possible, make a  friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found things in  that separate state.  But he never fulfill'd his promise.    The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his  house, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing.  I  was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,  besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money for  purchasing the press and types, paper, etc.  For these letters I was  appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready, but a  future time was still named.  Thus he went on till the ship, whose  departure too had been several times postponed, was on the point of  sailing.  Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive the letters,  his secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governor was  extremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle before the  ship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.    Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined to  accompany me in this voyage.  It was thought he intended to establish a  correspondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found  afterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, he  purposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again.  Having  taken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with Miss  Read, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle.  The governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary  came to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he  could not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost  importance, but should send the letters to me on board, wish'd me  heartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc.  I returned on board a  little puzzled, but still not doubting.    Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken passage  in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a Quaker  merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work in  Maryland, had engag'd the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were forced  to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board knowing us,  were considered as ordinary persons.  But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it  was James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle to Philadelphia, the  father being recall'd by a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and,  just before we sail'd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me  great respect, I was more taken notice of, and, with my friend Ralph,  invited by the other gentlemen to come into the cabin, there being now  room.  Accordingly, we remov'd thither.    Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor's  despatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to be under  my care.  He said all were put into the bag together and he could not  then come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have an  opportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for the present,  and we proceeded on our voyage.  We had a sociable company in the  cabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr.  Hamilton's stores, who had laid in plentifully.  In this passage Mr.  Denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.  The voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of  bad weather.    When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and  gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's letters.  I found none upon which my name was put as under my care.  I picked out  six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be the promised  letters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket, the king's  printer, and another to some stationer.  We arriv'd in London the 24th  of December, 1724.  I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my  way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith.  \"I don't know such  a person,\" says he; but, opening the letter, \"O! this is from  Riddlesden.  I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal, and I  will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from him.\"  So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and left me  to serve some customer.  I was surprized to find these were not the  governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing  circumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity.  I found my friend  Denham, and opened the whole affair to him.  He let me into Keith's  character; told me there was not the least probability that he had  written any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the smallest  dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the governor's giving  me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#9)"],[1,"with his  hand, and looking up at them in the cart. \"There's only one thing as I  knows on as'll cure old folks like you and I o' th' rheumatiz.\"    \"Wot be that then, farmer?\" inquired Benjy.    \"Churchyard mould,\" said the old iron-gray man, with another chuckle.  And so they said their good-byes and went their ways home. Tom's wart  was gone in a fortnight, but not so Benjy's rheumatism, which laid him  by the heels more and more. And though Tom still spent many an hour with  him, as he sat on a bench in the sunshine, or by the chimney corner when  it was cold, he soon had to seek elsewhere for his regular companions.    Tom had been accustomed often to accompany his mother in her visits to  the cottages, and had thereby made acquaintance with many of the village  boys of his own age. There was Job Rudkin, son of widow Rudkin, the most  bustling woman in the parish. How she could ever have had such a stolid  boy as Job for a child must always remain a mystery. The first time  Tom went to their cottage with his mother, Job was not indoors; but he  entered soon after, and stood with both hands in his pockets, staring  at Tom. Widow Rudkin, who would have had to cross madam to get at  young Hopeful--a breach of good manners of which she was wholly  incapable--began a series of pantomime signs, which only puzzled him;  and at last, unable to contain herself longer, burst out with, \"Job!  Job! where's thy cap?\"    \"What! bean't 'ee on ma head, mother?\" replied Job, slowly extricating  one hand from a pocket, and feeling for the article in question; which  he found on his head sure enough, and left there, to his mother's horror  and Tom's great delight.    Then there was poor Jacob Dodson, the half-witted boy, who ambled about  cheerfully, undertaking messages and little helpful odds and ends for  every one, which, however, poor Jacob managed always hopelessly to  imbrangle. Everything came to pieces in his hands, and nothing would  stop in his head. They nicknamed him Jacob Doodle-calf.    But above all there was Harry Winburn, the quickest and best boy in the  parish. He might be a year older than Tom, but was very little bigger,  and he was the Crichton of our village boys. He could wrestle and climb  and run better than all the rest, and learned all that the schoolmaster  could teach him faster than that worthy at all liked. He was a boy to  be proud of, with his curly brown hair, keen gray eye, straight active  figure, and little ears and hands and feet, \"as fine as a lord's,\" as  Charity remarked to Tom one day, talking, as usual, great nonsense.  Lords' hands and ears and feet are just as ugly as other folk's when  they are children, as any one may convince himself if he likes to look.  Tight boots and gloves, and doing nothing with them, I allow make a  difference by the time they are twenty.    Now that Benjy was laid on the shelf, and his young brothers were still  under petticoat government, Tom, in search of companions, began to  cultivate the village boys generally more and more. Squire Brown, be it  said, was a true-blue Tory to the backbone, and believed honestly that  the powers which be were ordained of God, and that loyalty and steadfast  obedience were men's first duties. Whether it were in consequence or in  spite of his political creed, I do not mean to give an opinion, though  I have one; but certain it is that he held therewith divers social  principles not generally supposed to be true blue in colour. Foremost of  these, and the one which the Squire loved to propound above all others,  was the belief that a man is to be valued wholly and solely for that  which he is in himself, for that which stands up in the four fleshly  walls of him, apart from clothes, rank, fortune, and all externals  whatsoever. Which belief I take to be a wholesome corrective of all  political opinions, and, if held sincerely, to make all opinions equally  harmless, whether they be blue, red, or green. As a necessary corollary  to this belief, Squire Brown held further that it didn't matter a  straw whether his son associated with lords' sons or ploughmen's sons,  provided they were brave and honest. He himself had played football  and gone bird-nesting with the farmers whom he met at vestry and  the labourers who tilled their fields, and so had his father and  grandfather, with their progenitors. So he encouraged Tom in his  intimacy with the boys of the village, and forwarded it by all means  in his power, and gave them the run of a close for a playground, and  provided bats and balls and a football for their sports.    Our village was blessed amongst other things with a well-endowed school.  The building stood by itself, apart from the master's house, on an angle  of ground where three roads met--an old gray stone building with a steep  roof and mullioned windows. On one of the opposite angles stood Squire  Brown's stables and kennel, with their backs to the road, over which  towered a great elm-tree; on the third stood the village carpenter and  wheelwright's large open shop, and his house and the schoolmaster's,  with long low eaves, under which the swallows built by scores.    The moment Tom's lessons were over, he would now get him down to this  corner by the stables, and watch till the boys came out of school. He  prevailed on the groom to cut notches for him in the bark of the elm  so that he could climb into the lower branches; and there he would sit  watching the school door, and speculating on the possibility of turning  the elm into a dwelling-place for himself and friends, after the manner  of the Swiss Family Robinson. But the school hours were long and Tom's  patience short, so that he soon began to descend into the street, and go  and peep in at the school door and the wheelwright's shop, and look out  for something to while away the time. Now the wheelwright was a choleric  man, and one fine afternoon, returning from a short absence, found Tom  occupied with one of his pet adzes, the edge of which was fast vanishing  under our hero's care. A speedy flight saved Tom from all but one sound  cuff on the ears; but he resented this unjustifiable interruption of his  first essays at carpentering, and still more the further proceedings  of the wheelwright, who cut a switch, and hung it over the door of his  workshop, threatening to use it upon Tom if he came within twenty yards  of his gate. So Tom, to retaliate, commenced a war upon the swallows who  dwelt under the wheelwright's eaves, whom he harassed with sticks  and stones; and being fleeter of foot than his enemy, escaped all  punishment, and kept him in perpetual anger. Moreover, his presence  about the school door began to incense the master, as the boys in that  neighbourhood neglected their lessons in consequence; and more than once  he issued into the porch, rod in hand, just as Tom beat a hasty retreat.  And he and the wheelwright, laying their heads together, resolved to  acquaint the Squire with Tom's afternoon occupations; but in order to  do it with effect, determined to take him captive and lead him away to  judgment fresh from his evil doings. This they would have found some  difficulty in doing, had Tom continued the war single-handed, or rather  single-footed, for he would have taken to the deepest part of Pebbly  Brook to escape them; but, like other active powers, he was ruined by  his alliances. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf could not go to the school with  the other boys, and one fine afternoon, about three o'clock (the school  broke up at four), Tom found him ambling about the street, and pressed  him into a visit to the school-porch. Jacob, always ready to do what he  was asked, consented, and the two stole down to the school together.  Tom first reconnoitred the wheelwright's shop; and seeing no signs  of activity, thought all safe in that quarter, and ordered at once an  advance of all his troops upon the schoolporch. The door of the school  was ajar, and the boys seated on the nearest bench at once recognized  and opened a correspondence with the invaders. Tom, waxing bold, kept  putting his head into the school and making faces at the master when  his back was turned. Poor Jacob, not in the least comprehending the  situation, and in high glee at finding himself so near the school, which  he had never been allowed to enter, suddenly, in a fit of enthusiasm,  pushed by Tom, and ambling three steps into the school, stood there,  looking round him and nodding with a self-approving smile. The master,  who was stooping over a boy's slate, with his back to the door, became  aware of something unusual, and turned quickly round. Tom rushed at  Jacob, and began dragging him back by his smock-frock, and the master  made at them, scattering forms and boys in his career. Even now they  might have escaped, but that in the porch, barring retreat, appeared the  crafty wheelwright, who had been watching all their proceedings. So they  were seized, the school dismissed, and Tom and Jacob led away to Squire  Brown as lawful prize, the boys following to the gate in groups, and  speculating on the result.    The Squire was very angry at first, but the interview, by Tom's  pleading, ended in a compromise. Tom was not to go near the school till  three o'clock, and only then if he had done his own lessons well, in  which case he was to be the bearer of a note to the master from Squire  Brown; and the master agreed in such case to release ten or twelve of  the best boys an hour before the time of breaking up, to go off and play  in the close. The wheelwright's adzes and swallows were to be for ever  respected; and that hero and the master withdrew to the servants' hall  to drink the Squire's health, well satisfied with their day's work.    The second act of Tom's life may now be said to have begun. The war of  independence had been over for some time: none of the women now--not  even his mother's maid--dared offer to help him in dressing or  washing. "]]]
