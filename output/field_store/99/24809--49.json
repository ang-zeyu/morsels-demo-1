Upon this  accession of fortune, the Baron Casteja, as is but too frequent, fell to  his old habit, and became as fond of gaming as ever. The poor lady saw  this with the utmost concern, and dreaded the confounding this legacy,  as all the baron's former fortune had been consumed by his being the  dupe of gamesters. In deep affliction at the consideration of what  might in future times become the Chevalier's fortune, she therefore  entreated the baron to lay out part of the sum in somewhat which might  be a provision for his son. The baron promised both readily and  faithfully that he would out of the first remittance. A few weeks later  he received forty thousand crowns and the baroness and he set out for  Brussels, under pretence of enquiring for something proper for his  purpose, carrying with him twenty thousand crowns for the purchase. But  he forgot the errand upon the road, and no sooner arrived at Brussels,  but going to a famous marquis's entertainment, in a very few hours lost  the last penny of his money. Returning home after this misfortune, he  was a little out of humour for a week, but at the end of that space,  making up the other twenty thousand privately he intended to set out  next day.    The poor lady, at her wit's end for fear this large sum should go the  same way as the other, bethought herself of a method of securing both  the cash and her son's place. She communicated her design to her major  domo, who readily came into it, and having taken three of the servants  and the baroness's page into the secret, he sent for Barton and another  Englishman quartered near them, and easily prevailed on them for a very  small sum, to become accomplices in the undertaking. In a word, the lady  having provided disguises for them, and a man's suit for herself, caused  the touch-holes of the arms which the baron and two servants carried  with him to be nailed up, and then towards evening sallying at the head  of her little troop from a wood, as he passed on the road, the baron  being rendered incapable of resistance, was robbed of the whole twenty  thousand crowns. With this she settled her son, and the baron was so far  touched at the loss of such a provision for his family, that he made a  real and thorough reformation, and Barton from this exploit fell in love  with robbing ever after.    Another adventure he related was this. Being taken prisoner by the  French, and carried to one of their frontier garrisons, a treaty shortly  being expected to be settled, to relieve the miseries he endured, Barton  got into the service of a Gascon officer who proved at bottom almost as  poor as himself. However, after Barton's coming he quickly found a way  to live as well as anybody in the garrison, which he accomplished thus.  All play at games of chance was, in the score of some unlucky accidents  proceeding from quarrels which it had occasioned, absolutely forbidden,  and the provosts were enjoined to visit all quarters, in order to bring  the offenders to shameful punishments. The Gascon captain took advantage  of the severity of this order, and having concerted the matter with a  countryman and comrade of his, a known gamester, plundered all the rest  who were addicted to that destructive passion; for gaining intelligence  of the private places where they met, from his friend, he putting  himself, Barton and another person into proper habits, attacked these  houses suddenly almost every night with a crowd of the populace at his  heels, and raised swinging contributions on those who being less wicked  than himself never had any suspicion of his actions, but took him and  his comrades for the proper officer and his attendants.    Barton's greatest unhappiness was his marriage. He was too uxorious, and  too solicitous for what concerned his wife, how well so ever she  deserved of him; for not enduring to see her work honestly for her bread  he would needs support her in an easy state of life, though at the  hazard of the gallows. There is, however, little question to be made but  that he had learned much in his travels to enable him to carry on his  wicked designs with more ease and dexterity, for no thief, perhaps, in  any age, managed his undertakings with greater prudence and economy. And  having somewhere picked up the story of the Pirate and Alexander the  Great, it became one of Will's standing maxims that the only difference  between a robber and a conqueror was the value of the prize.    Being one day on the road with a comrade of his, who had served also  with him abroad in the Army, and observing a stage coach at a distance,  in right of the seniority of his commission as a Knight of the Pad,  Barton commanded the other to ride forward in order to reconnoitre. The  young fellow obeyed him as submissively as if he had been an aide de  camp, and returning, brought him word that the force of the enemy  consisted of four beau laden with blunderbusses, two ladies and a  footman. _Then_, quoth Will, _we may e'en venture to attack them. Let us  make our necessary disposition. I will ride slowly up to them, while you  gallop round that hill, and as soon as you come behind the coach, be  sure to fire a pistol over it, and leave the rest to me._    Things thus adjusted, each advanced on his attack. Barton no sooner  stopped the coach and presented his pistol at one window, than his  companion, after firing a brace of balls over the coachman's head, did  the like at the other, which so surprised the fine gentlemen within,  that without the least resistance they surrendered all they had about  them, which amounted to about one hundred pounds, which Barton put up.  _Come, gentlemen_, says he, _let us make bold with your fire-arms too,  for you see we make more use of them than you._ So, seizing a brace of  pistols inlaid with silver, and two fine brass blunderbusses, Will and  his subaltern rode off.    But alas, Will's luck would not last (as his rogueship used to express  it). For, attempting a robbery in Covent Garden, where he was too well  known, he was surprised, committed to Newgate and on his conviction  ordered to be transported for seven years to his Majesty's Plantations,  whither he was accordingly carried.    When he was landed, a planter bought him after the manner of that  country, and paid eighteen pounds for him. Barton wanting neither  understanding nor address, he soon became the darling of his master, who  far from employing him in those laborious works which are usually talked  of here, put upon him nothing more than merely supervising his slaves  and taking care of them, when business obliged him to be absent.    One would have thought that so easy a state of life, after the toil and  miseries such a man as him of whom we are speaking must have run  through, would have been pleasing, and that it might have become a means  of reclaiming him from those vices so heinous in the sight of God, and  for which he had barely escaped the greatest punishment that can be  inflicted by man. At first, it indeed made some impressions not very  different from these; Barton owning that his master's treatment was such  that if a man had not absolutely bent his mind on such courses as  necessarily must make him unhappy, he might have enjoyed all he could  have hoped for there. Of which he became so sensible that for some time  he remained fully satisfied with his condition.    But alas! Content, when its basis rests not upon virtue, like a house  founded on a sandy soil is incapable of continuing long. No sooner had  Barton leisure and opportunity to recollect home, his friends, and above  all his wife, but it soon shocked his repose, and having awhile  disturbed and troubled him, it pushed him at last on the unhappy  resolution or returning to England, before the expiration of his time  for which he was banished. This project rolled for a very considerable  space in the fellow's head. Sometimes the desire of seeing his  companions, and above all things his wife, made him eager to undertake  it; at others, the fear of running upon inevitable death in case of a  discovery, and the consideration of the felicity he now had in his power  made him timorous, at least, if not unwilling to return.    At last, as is ordinary amongst these unhappy people, the worst opinion  prevailed, and finding a method to free himself from his master, and to  get aboard a ship, he came back to his dearly beloved London, and to  those measures which had already occasioned so great a misfortune, and  at last brought him to an ignominious death. On his return, his first  care was to seek out his wife, for whom he had a warm and never ceasing  affection, and having found her, he went to live with her, taking his  old methods of supporting them, though he constantly denied that she was  either a partner in the commission, or even so much as in the knowledge  of his guilt. But this quickly brought him to Newgate again, and to that  fatal end to which he, like some other flagitious creatures of this  stamp, seem impatient to arrive; since no warning, no admonition, no  escape is sufficient to deter them from those crimes, which they are  sensible the laws of their country with Justice have rendered capital.    Barton's return from transportation was sufficient to have brought him  to death had he committed nothing besides; but he, whether through  necessity, as having no way left of living honestly, or from his own  evil inclinations, ventured upon his old trade, and robbing amongst  others the Lord Viscount Lisbourn, of the Kingdom of Ireland, and a lady  who was with him in the coach, of a silver hilted sword, a snuff-box and  about twelve shillings in money, he was for this fact taken, tried and  convicted at the Old Bailey.    He immediately laid by all hopes of life as soon as he had received  sentence, and with great earnestness set"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#9)"],[1," asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being  quite naked and uncovered; and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went  away, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying:--\"Up, up,  wife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale to such  purpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand.\" \"How can  this be?\" said the lady. \"Come quickly, and thou shalt see,\" replied  Messer Lizio. So the lady huddled on her clothes, and silently followed  Messer Lizio, and when they were come to the bed, and had raised the  curtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly enough how her daughter had  caught, and did hold the nightingale, whose song she had so longed to  hear. Whereat the lady, deeming that Ricciardo had played her a cruel  trick, would have cried out and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to  her:--\"Wife, as thou valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth,  seeing that she has caught him, he shall be hers. Ricciardo is a  gentleman and wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our  advantage: if he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry  her, so that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage  and not in that of another.\" Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing that  her husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had had a  good night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale. So she kept  silence; nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo awoke; and, seeing  that 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much as his life was worth,  and aroused Caterina, saying:--\"Alas! my soul, what shall we do, now that  day has come and surprised me here?\" Which question Messer Lizio answered  by coming forward, and saying:--\"We shall do well.\" At sight of him  Ricciardo felt as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in  the bed, and said:--\"My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that  my disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with me  even as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it may be, to  spare my life, that I die not.\" \"Ricciardo,\" replied Messer Lizio, \"the  love I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited a better  return; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into such a  transgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by making  Caterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for this past  night, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way thou mayst  secure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy soul to God.\"  Pending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale, and having  covered herself, began with many a tear to implore her father to forgive  Ricciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio required, that thereby  they might securely count upon a long continuance of such nights of  delight. But there needed not much supplication; for, what with remorse  for the wrong done, and the wish to make amends, and the fear of death,  and the desire to escape it, and above all ardent love, and the craving  to possess the beloved one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal  of his readiness to do as Messer Lizio would have him. Wherefore Messer  Lizio, having borrowed a ring from Madonna Giacomina, Ricciardo did there  and then in their presence wed Caterina. Which done, Messer Lizio and the  lady took their leave, saying:--\"Now rest ye a while; for so perchance  'twere better for you than if ye rose.\" And so they left the young folks,  who forthwith embraced, and not having travelled more than six miles  during the night, went two miles further before they rose, and so  concluded their first day. When they were risen, Ricciardo and Messer  Lizio discussed the matter with more formality; and some days afterwards  Ricciardo, as was meet, married the damsel anew in presence of their  friends and kinsfolk, and brought her home with great pomp, and  celebrated his nuptials with due dignity and splendour. And so for many a  year thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness, and snared the  nightingales day and night to his heart's content.      NOVEL V.    --  Guidotto da Cremona dies leaving a girl to Giacomino da Pavia. She has  two lovers in Faenza, to wit, Giannole di Severino and Minghino di  Mingole, who fight about her. She is discovered to be Giannole's sister,  and is given to Minghino to wife.  --    All the ladies laughed so heartily over the story of the nightingale,  that, even when Filostrato had finished, they could not control their  merriment. However, when the laughter was somewhat abated, the queen  said:--\"Verily if thou didst yesterday afflict us, to-day thou hast  tickled us to such purpose that none of us may justly complain of thee.\"  Then, as the turn had now come round to Neifile, she bade her give them a  story. And thus, blithely, Neifile began:--As Filostrato went to Romagna  for the matter of his discourse, I too am fain to make a short journey  through the same country in what I am about to relate to you.    I say, then, that there dwelt of yore in the city of Fano two Lombards,  the one ycleped Guidotto da Cremona and the other Giacomino da Pavia, men  advanced in life, who, being soldiers, had spent the best part of their  youth in feats of arms. Now Guidotto, being at the point of death, and  having no son or any friend or kinsman in whom he placed more trust than  in Giacomino, left him a girl of about ten years, and all that he had in  the world, and so, having given him to know not a little of his affairs,  he died. About the same time the city of Faenza, which had long been at  war and in a most sorry plight, began to recover some measure of  prosperity; and thereupon liberty to return thither on honourable terms  was accorded to all that were so minded. Whither, accordingly, Giacomino,  who had dwelt there aforetime, and liked the place, returned with all his  goods and chattels, taking with him the girl left him by Guidotto, whom  he loved and entreated as his daughter. The girl grew up as beautiful a  maiden as was to be found in the city; and no less debonair and modest  was she than fair. Wherefore she lacked not admirers; but above all two  young men, both very gallant and of equal merit, the one Giannole di  Severino, the other Minghino di Mingole, affected her with so ardent a  passion, that, growing jealous, they came to hate one another with an  inordinate hatred. Right gladly would each have espoused her, she being  now fifteen years old, but that his kinsmen forbade it; wherefore seeing  that neither might have her in an honourable way, each determined to  compass his end as best he might.    Now Giacomino had in his house an ancient maid, and a man, by name  Crivello, a very pleasant and friendly sort of fellow, with whom Giannole  grew familiar, and in due time confided to him all his love, praying him  to further the attainment of his desire, and promising to reward him  handsomely, if he did so. Crivello made answer:--\"Thou must know that  there is but one way in which I might be of service to thee in this  affair: I might contrive that thou shouldst be where she is when  Giacomino is gone off to supper; but, were I to presume to say aught to  her on thy behalf, she would never listen to me. This, if it please thee,  I promise to do for thee, and will be as good as my word; and then thou  canst do whatever thou mayst deem most expedient.\" Giannole said that he  asked no more; and so 'twas arranged.    Meanwhile Minghino on his part had made friends with the maid, on whom he  had so wrought that she had carried several messages to the girl, and had  gone far to kindle her to his love, and furthermore had promised to  contrive that he should meet her when for any cause Giacomino should be  from home in the evening. And so it befell that no long time after these  parleys, Giacomino, by Crivello's management, was to go sup at the house  of a friend, and by preconcert between Crivello and Giannole, upon signal  given, Giannole was to come to Giacomino's house and find the door open.  The maid, on her part, witting nought of the understanding between  Crivello and Giannole, let Minghino know that Giacomino would not sup at  home, and bade him be near the house, so that he might come and enter it  on sight of a signal from her. The evening came; neither of the lovers  knew aught of what the other was about; but, being suspicious of one  another, they came to take possession, each with his own company of armed  friends. Minghino, while awaiting the signal, rested with his company in  the house of one of his friends hard by the girl's house: Giannole with  his company was posted a little farther off. Crivello and the maid, when  Giacomino was gone, did each their endeavour to get the other out of the  way. Crivello said to the maid:--\"How is it thou takest not thyself off  to bed, but goest still hither and thither about the house?\" And the maid  said to Crivello:--\"Nay, but why goest thou not after thy master? Thou  hast supped; what awaitest thou here?\" And so, neither being able to make  the other quit the post, Crivello, the hour concerted with Giannole being  come, said to himself:--What care I for her? If she will not keep quiet,  'tis like to be the worse for her. Whereupon he gave the signal, and hied  him to the door, which he had no sooner opened, than Giannole entered  with two of his companions, and finding the girl in the saloon, laid  hands on her with intent to carry her off. The girl struggled, and  shrieked amain, as did also the maid. Minghino, fearing the noise, hasted  to the spot with his companions; and, seeing that the girl was already  being borne across the threshold, they drew their swords, and cried out  in chorus:--\"Ah! Traitors that ye are, ye are all dead men! 'Twill go  otherwise than ye think for. What means this force?\" Which said, they  fell upon them with their swords, while the neighbours, alarmed by the"]]]
