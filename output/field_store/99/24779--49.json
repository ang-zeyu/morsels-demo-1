P.T.W.      _Expensive Fishing._--In 1609, the Dutch were compelled to pay a tribute  for fishing on our coast; in 1683, they paid 30,000l. for liberty to  fish. Welwood, in his answer to Grotius, says, \"that the Scots obliged  the Dutch, by treaty, to keep eighty miles from shore in fishing, and to  pay a tribute at the port of Aberdeen, where a tower was erected for  that and other purposes; and the Dutch paid the tribute, even in the  memory of our forefathers.\"    THOMAS GILL.           *       *       *       *       *    _Printed and published by J.

Not long  after while they were talking, they went to sleep, and when it began  to be early morning Ini-init went to make the sun on all the world;  when they had finished to eat he went to shine. Aponibolinayen staid  in the house. When it came afternoon, the sun went down and he went  directly to fish in the river, for the fish which they ate--the two  who were married. Not long after he caught again a big fish, and he  went home. When he arrived, Aponibolinayen had finished cooking, and  he asked where she got the fish which she had cooked, and she said,  \"Why do you ask again? You know it is the stick which I cook, which is  fish, which we ate, before you arrived again with fish. Throw away the  fish which you caught, for this stick is many fish which I cook.\" After  that Ini-init said, \"Why do you order to throw away, that which serves  the purpose to which we put it, even though you cook many sticks?\" \"If  you value it, hang it on the hanger, and you come and eat.\"    Not long after they ate, and when they had finished eating, they  washed, and when they had finished washing those things which they  used to eat on, they talked and they went to sleep.    When it became the middle of the night, Aponibolinayen woke up. \"I go  up with you when you go up in the early morning,\" she said. Ini-init  said to her, \"Do not come, for it is very hot up above. You cannot  endure the heat, and you will repent when we are there.\" \"No, if it  is too hot, we shall take many blankets and pillows, which I shall  go under,\" she said again and again until it became early morning,  then Ini-init agreed. They ate first and then they arranged those  pillows and blankets which they took with them.    Not long after they went east, and when they arrived there the  sun shone, and Aponibolinayen became oil because it was so hot,  and Ini-init put her in a bottle, and he corked it and covered it  with blankets and pillows, which sheltered her, and he dropped it  down. She fell by the well in Kaodanan, and Indiapan, who was still  dipping water, turned her face at the sound of the falling at her  side. She saw many good blankets and pillows, and she unwrapped that  which was wrapped, and when she had finished to unwrap she saw it was  a pretty lady--none equal to her--and she was frightened. She went  quickly to go up to the town, where they lived, and when she arrived  there she said to the people, \"We have been searching a long time  for Aponibolinayen, and you killed and used many cows as food for  the searchers, and you spent much for her. She is at the spring. I  was frightened when she fell by me, who was dipping water from the  well. I saw many pretty blankets and pillows, and I unwrapped that  which was wrapped, and it was Aponibolinayen whom we are seeking,\"  said Indiapan. They went quickly--her father and mother--and the other  men went to see her, and when they arrived at the place of the well  they saw Aponibolinayen whom they sought. \"Where did you come from,  Aponibolinayen, for whom we have been seeking? We have invited many  and have fed many to search for you. Among the towns there is not one  we did not search for you, and now you are here,\" said her father and  mother. She said, \"I came from Pindayan. I nearly did not come, because  the _alzados_ [96] closed the way, and I escaped while they slept.\"    Not long after they went up to the town, and not long after they went  to wash their hair and bathe in the river, and when they had finished  washing their hair they went home.    Ebang said, \"Ala! husband Pagatipanan, let us make _balaua_ [97]  and invite our relatives who are sorrowing for Aponibolinayen,\" and  Pagatipanan said, \"We shall make _balaua_ when next month comes, but  now Aponibolinayen feels ill, perhaps she is tired.\" Not long after  that Aponibolinayen commanded them to prick her little finger which  itched; and when her mother pricked it out popped a pretty baby. [98]  Her mother asked, \"Where did you get this baby, Aponibolinayen?\" But  Aponibolinayen did not tell. \"I do not know where I got it, and I did  not feel,\" she said. When they could not compel her to tell where she  secured the baby, \"Ala, we make _balaua_ to-morrow,\" said the father  and mother.    They made _balaua_, and not long after Ebang used magic, so that many  people went to pound rice for them, and when they had finished to  pound rice they built _balaua_, and they went to get the betel-nut  which is covered with gold for chewing. When these arrived, Ebang  oiled them when it began to get dark. \"You betel-nuts go to all the  people in the whole world and invite them. If any of them do not come,  you grow on their knees,\" said Ebang. And those betel-nuts went to  invite all the people in the whole world. Every time they bathed  the child they used magic, so that it grew as often as they washed  it, until it walked. The betel-nuts arrived in the towns where they  went to invite. The one that went to Nagbotobotan--the place where  lived the old woman Alokotan--said, \"Good morning, I do not tarry,  the reason of my coming is that Ebang and Pagatipanan commanded  me, because Aponibolinayen is there.\" \"Yes, you go first, I will  come, I will follow you. I go first to wash my hair and bathe,\" she  said. The betel-nut which is covered with gold said, \"I wait for you,  for if you do not come, I shall grow on your knee.\" The old woman  Alokotan started when she finished washing her hair and bathing. The  betel-nut, which was covered with gold, took her, and not long after  they arrived, and they met those whom the other betel-nuts went to  summon in the other towns. No one wanted the baby to go to them,  [99] and when none wished it to approach, the old woman Alokotan  summoned the spirits. (\"What town did they not yet invite?\" This  question was added by the story-teller. Not part of tale.) The old  woman Alokotan said, \"You invited all the people except Ini-init,  who is above. You did not send the prepared betel-nut covered with  gold to summon him. Perhaps he made Aponibolinayen pregnant, because  the _siksiklat_ took her up when they went to gather greens--she and  her sister-in-law, who is Dinay.\"    They commanded the betel-nuts, and they oiled them, and sent  them. Not long after the betel-nut, whom they sent, arrived above,  who went to call Ini-init. And the betel-nut said, when he arrived,  \"Good morning, Sun, I do not tarry. The reason of my visit is that  Ebang and Pagatipanan, who make _balaua_, send me. If you do not wish  to come, I will grow on your head.\" The sun said, \"Grow on my head,  I do not wish to go.\" The betel-nut jumped up and went on his head,  and it grew. Not long after the betel-nut became tall and the sun was  not able to carry it, because it became big, and he was in pain. \"You  go to my pig, that is what you grow on,\" he said. Not long after the  betel-nut jumped on the head of his pig, and the pig began to squeal  because it could not carry the betel-nut which began to grow on its  head. And Ini-init said, \"Ala! get off my big pig and I come.\" The  betel-nut got off the pig.    Not long after they went and Pagatipanan carried the baby near to  the gate. When Ini-init and the betel-nut approached, the baby was  happy and he went to be carried by Ini-init. When they arrived at the  festival place, the people saw that he who carried the baby rolled  because he was round, and they saw he was not a man but a stone, and  Ebang and Pagatipanan said, \"Ala! Aponibolinayen, you start and take  off your arm beads and you dress in rags, you wrap your wrists with  strings, in place of the arm beads, so that you can go with the stone  when he takes you to his home, when our _balaua_ is finished.\" Not  long after Aponibolinayen started. She took off her beads and her  dresses and exchanged them for rags and strings. When she changed her  dresses, she went down the ladder, and she saw that he who carried  the baby was a stone, which was round. After that Pagatipanan said,  \"Ala! now our _balaua_ is finished, you go home to the town of the  stone.\" Aponibolinayen said, \"Yes, if that is what you say.\" Those  people who were invited bade them good-by, and when they went away,  they went home also--those whom they invited.    Not long after they arrived at their home and the sun became a man,  he who had been a stone before. \"When next month comes we shall  build _balaua_, Aponibolinayen, so that we can invite our relatives,  and I will pay the marriage price, because I marry you,\" [100] said  Ini-init to her. Soon the month arrived in which they said they would  build _balaua_, and they summoned the old woman Alokotan, to start  the _balaua_. Not long after they sent to get _bolo_ and _lono_ [101]  with which to make the _dakidak_ and _talapitap_. [102] When it became  afternoon the old woman Alokotan began to sing _da-eng_ [103] and the  next night they sang _da-eng_ again. Not long after they commanded  to pound rice, and Aponibolinayen used magic so that many women went  to pound with them. [104] And Ini-init practiced magic so that they  had many neighbors, and many who went to pound rice with them.    Soon they commanded to get the timbers for the _balaua_, and they  prepared everything which they needed. When it became morning they  built _balaua_, and not long after they went to get the prepared  betel-nut, which is covered with gold, which they sent to invite  their relatives. [105]    When they arrived--those prepared betel-nuts which were covered with  gold--they oiled them at the beginning of the night, and sent them  to invite. Aponibolinayen said, \"I will use magic, so that you,  betel-nut, may reach the town of our relatives so that you invite  all of them. When there is one who will not come, you grow on their  knees, as long as they do not come.\" Not long after "]]]
