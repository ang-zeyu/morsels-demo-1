The crowd would be just as numerous and noisy if they were  conducting me to the scaffold!\"    However, these festivals and demonstrations at length subsided, and his  life resumed its more tranquil course.    Bonaparte could now once more spend a few secluded days of rest and calm  enjoyment in his (by this time more richly-decorated) dwelling in the  Rue Chautereine, the name of which the city authorities had changed to  _Rue de la Victoire_, in honor of the conqueror at Arcola and Marengo.  He could, after so many battles and triumphs, afford to repose a while  in the arms of love and happiness.    Nevertheless, this inactivity soon began to press heavily on his  restless spirit. He longed for new exploits, for fresh victories. He  felt that he was only at the commencement, and not at the end of his  conquering career; he constantly heard ringing in his ears the notes of  the battle-clarion, summoning him to renewed triumphs and to other paths  of glory. Love could only delight his heart, but could not completely  satisfy it. Repose he deemed but the beginning of death.    \"If I remain here inactive any longer, I am lost,\" said he. \"They retain  the resemblance of nothing whatever in Paris; one celebrity blots out  another in this great Babylon; if I show myself much oftener to the  public, they will cease to look at me, and if I do not soon undertake  something new, they will forget me.\"    And he did undertake something new, something unprecedented, that filled  all Europe with astonishment. He left the shores of France with an army  to conquer, for the French Republic, that ancient land of Egypt, on  whose pyramids the green moss of long-forgotten ages was flourishing.    Josephine did not accompany him. She remained behind in Paris; but she  needed consolation and encouragement to enable her to sustain this  separation, which Bonaparte himself had confessed to her might be just  as likely to last six years as six months. And what could afford better  consolation to a heart so tender as Josephine's than the presence of her  beloved daughter? She had willingly given up her son to her husband, and  he had accompanied the latter to Egypt, but her daughter remained, and  her she would not give up to any one, not even to Madame Campan's  boarding-school.    Besides, the education of Hortense was now completed. She who had come  to St. Germain as a child, left the boarding-school, after two years'  stay, a handsome, blooming young lady, adorned with all the charms of  innocence, youth, grace, and refinement.    Although she was now a young lady of nearly sixteen, she had retained  the thoughts and ways of her childhood. Her heart was as a white sheet  of paper, on which no profane hand had ventured to write a mortal name.  She loved nothing beyond her mother, her brother, the fine arts, and  flowers. She entertained a profound but speechless veneration for her  young step-father. His burning gaze made her uneasy and timorous; his  commanding voice made her heart throb anxiously; in fine, she  reverenced him with adoring but too agitated an impression of awe to  find it possible to love him. He was for her at all times the hero, the  lord and master, the father to whom she owed implicit obedience, but she  dared not love him; she could only look up to and honor him from  a distance.    Hortense loved nothing but her mother, her brother, the fine arts, and  flowers. She still looked out, with the expectant eyes of a child, upon  the world which seemed so beautiful and inviting to her, and from which  she hoped yet to obtain some grand dazzling piece of good fortune  without having any accurate idea in what it was to consist. She still  loved all mankind, and believed in their truth and rectitude. No thorn  had yet wounded her heart; no disenchantment, no bright illusion dashed  to pieces, had yet left its shadow on that clear, lofty brow of  transparent whiteness. The expression of her large blue eyes was still  radiant and undimmed, and her laugh was so clear and ringing, that it  almost made her mother sad to hear it, for it sounded to her like the  last echo of some sweet, enchanting song of childhood, and she but too  well knew that it would soon be hushed.    But Hortense still laughed, still sang with the birds, rivalling their  melodies; the world still lay before her like an early morning dream,  and she still hoped for the rising of the sun.    Such was Hortense when her mother took her from Madame Campan's  boarding-school, to accompany her to the baths of Plombieres. But there  it was that Hortense came near experiencing the greatest sorrow of her  life, in nearly losing her mother.    She was with Josephine and some other ladies in the drawing-room of the  house they occupied at Plombieres. The doors facing the balcony were  open, to let in the warm summer air. Hortense was sitting by the window  painting a nosegay of wild flowers, that she had gathered with her own  hands on the hills of Plombieres. Josephine found the atmosphere of the  room too close, and invited some ladies to step out with her upon the  balcony. A moment afterward there was heard a deafening crash, followed  by piercing shrieks of terror; and when Hortense sprang in desperate  fright to the front entrance, she found that the balcony on which her  mother and the other ladies had stood had disappeared. Its fastenings  had given way, and they had been precipitated with it into the street.  Hortense, in the first impulse of her distress and horror, would have  sprung down after her beloved mother, and could only be held back with  the greatest difficulty. But this time fate had spared the young girl,  and refrained from darkening the pure, unclouded heaven of her youth.  Her mother escaped with no other injury than the fright, and a slight  wound on her arm, while one of the ladies had both legs broken.    Josephine's time to die had not yet come, for the prophecy of the  fortune-teller had not yet been fulfilled. Josephine was, indeed, the  wife of a renowned general, but she was not yet \"something more than  a queen.\"        CHAPTER VIII.    BONAPARTE'S RETURN FROM EGYPT.    Bonaparte had got back from Egypt. His victory at Aboukir had adorned  his brows with fresh laurels, and all France hailed the returning  conqueror with plaudits of exulting pride. For the first time, Hortense  was present at the festivities which the city of Paris dedicated to her  step-father; for the first time she saw the homage that men and women,  graybeards and children alike, paid to the hero of Italy and Egypt.  These festivities and this homage filled her heart with a tremor of  alarm, and yet, at the same time, with joyous exultation. In the midst  of these triumphs and these ovations which were thus offered to her  second father, the young girl recalled the prison in which her mother  had once languished, the scaffold upon which the head of her own father  had fallen; and frequently when she glanced at the rich gold-embroidered  uniform of her brother, she reminded him with a roguish smile of the  time when Eugene went in a blue blouse, as a carpenter's apprentice,  through the streets of Paris with a long plank on his shoulder.    These recollections of the first terrible days of her youth kept  Hortense from feeling the pride and arrogance of good fortune, preserved  to her modest, unassuming tone of mind, prevented her from entertaining  any overweening or domineering propensity in her day of prosperity, or  from seeming cast down and hopeless when adversity came. She never  lulled herself with the idea of good fortune that could not pass away,  but her remembrances kept her eyes wide open, and hence, when misfortune  came, it did not take her by surprise, but found her armed and ready to  confront it.    Nevertheless, she drank in the pleasure of these prosperous days in full  draughts, delighted as she was to see the mother, of whom she was so  fond, surrounded by such a halo of glory and gratified love; and in the  name of her murdered father she thanked General Bonaparte with double  fervor, from the bottom of her heart, for having been the means of  procuring for her mother, who had suffered so deeply in her first wedded  life, so magnificent a glow of splendor and happiness in her  second marriage.    In the mean while, new days of storm and tumult were at hand to dispel  this brief period of tranquil enjoyment. A fresh revolution convulsed  all France, and, ere long, Paris was divided into two hostile camps,  burning to begin the work of mutual annihilation. On one side stood the  democratic republicans, who looked back with longing regret to the days  of terrorism and bloodshed, perceiving, as they did, that tranquillity  and protracted peace must soon wrest the reins of power from their  grasp, and therefore anxiously desiring to secure control through the  element of intimidation. This party declared that liberty was in danger,  and the Constitution threatened; they summoned the _sans-culottes_ and  the loud-mouthed republicans of the clubs to the armed defence of the  imperilled country, and pointed with menacing hands at Bonaparte as the  man who wished to overthrow the republic, and put France once more in  the bonds of servitude.    On the other side stood the discreet friends of the country, the  republicans by compulsion, who denounced terrorism, and had sworn  fidelity to the republic, only because it was under this reptile  disguise alone that they could escape the threatening knife of the  guillotine. On this side were arrayed the men of mind, the artists and  poets who hopefully longed for a new era, because they knew that the  days of terror and of the tyrannical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12027"],[0,"Crime: Its Cause and Treatment (#9)"],[1,"with law-makers and  politicians in general than with the criminal class, which, of course,  is one reason why they have such unbounded confidence in the law. Such  persons are surprised and shocked when some member of the family or some  friend is entangled in the courts, and generally regard it as a  catastrophe that has come upon him by accident or a terrible mistake. As  a rule, they do all in their power to help him whether he is acquitted  or convicted. They never think that he and everyone else they know is  not materially different from the ordinary criminal. As a matter of  fact, the potential criminal is in every man, and no one was ever so  abandoned that some friend would not plead for him, or that some one who  knew him would not testify to his good deeds.    The criminal is not hard to understand. He is one who, from inherited  defects or from great misfortune or especially hard circumstances, is  not able to make the necessary adjustments to fit him to his  environment. Seldom is he a man of average intelligence, unless he  belongs to a certain class that will be discussed later. Almost always  he is below the normal of intelligence and in perhaps half of the cases  very much below. Nearly always he is a person of practically no  education and no property. One who has given attention to the subject of  crime knows exactly where the criminal comes from and how he will  develop. The crimes of violence and murder, and the lesser crimes  against property, practically all come from those who have been reared  in the poor and congested districts of cities and large villages. The  robbers, burglars, pickpockets and thieves are from these surroundings.  In a broad sense, some criminals are born and some are made. Nearly all  of them are both born and made. This does not mean that criminality can  be inherited, or even that there is a criminal type. It means that with  certain physical and mental imperfections and with certain environment  the criminal will be the result.    Seldom does one begin a criminal life as a full-grown man. The origin  of the typical criminal is an imperfect child, suffering from some  defect. Usually he was born with a weak intellect, or an unstable  nervous system. He comes from poor parents. Often one or both of these  died or met misfortune while he was young. He comes from the crowded  part of a poor district. He has had little chance to go to school and  could not have been a scholar, no matter how regularly he attended  school. Some useful things he could have learned had society furnished  the right teachers, surroundings and opportunities to make the most of  an imperfect child. Early in life he does some desultory work in casual  occupations. This of course is not steady, but he picks up what he can  and keeps the job for a short time, sometimes quitting work because he  is discharged and sometimes because, like most boys and men, he does not  like to work. His playground is the street, the railroad yards or vacant  lots too small for real play, and fit only for a loafing place for boys  like himself. These gather nightly and talk of the incidents that  interest most people, mainly the abnormal things of life and generally  the crimes that the newspapers make so prominent to satisfy the public  demand. He learns to go into vacant buildings, steals the plumbing, and  he early learns where to sell it. From this it is only a short step to  visiting occupied buildings at night. In this way he learns to be a  burglar as other boys learn to play baseball or golf.    Naturally he has no strong sense of property rights. He has always had a  hard time to get enough to eat and wear, and he has grown up  unconsciously to see the inequality of distribution and to believe that  it is not fair and that there is little or no justice in the world. As a  child he learned to get things the best way he could, and to think  nothing about it. In short, his life, like all other lives, moves along  the lines of least resistance. He soon comes to feel that the police are  his natural enemies and his chief business is to keep from getting  caught. Inevitably he is brought into the Juvenile Court. He may be  reprimanded at first. He comes again and is placed on probation. The  next time he goes to a Juvenile Prison where he can learn all the things  he has not found out before. He is known to the police, known to the  Court, known to the neighbors. His status is fixed. When released from  prison, he takes his old heredity back into his old environment. It is  the easiest to him, for he has learned to make his adjustments to this  environment. From fifteen to twenty-five years of age, he has the added  burden of adolescence, the trying time in a boy's life when sex feelings  are developing, when he is passing from childhood to manhood. This is a  very difficult time at best to the type of boy from which a criminal  grows; he meets it without preparation or instruction. What he knows he  learns from others like himself. He gets weird, fantastic, neurotic  ideas, which only add to his natural wonderment.    Every person who has not inherited property must live by some trade or  calling. Very few people in jail or out choose their profession. Even if  one selects his profession it does not follow that he has chosen the  calling for which he is best adapted. So far as a person can and does  follow his desires, he generally means to choose the calling which will  bring him the greatest amount of return for the least exertion. He may  have strong inclinations in certain directions, as, for instance, to  paint or to write or to investigate or to philosophize, but, as a rule,  he does not make his living from following these ambitions. If he does,  it is generally a poor living. But usually his aim is to make money at  something else so that he can give free rein to his real ambitions.    Most men start to make a living as boys from the ages of fifteen to  eighteen. They have no idea of what they ought to do or even of what  they want to do. Usually, so far as they have an ambition, it is to do  something more or less spectacular that seems to have an element of  adventure and not too disagreeable or hard; something like the work of  a policeman, a chauffeur, or an employee in a garage. Still, first and  last, most boys and most men have no opportunity for choosing an  occupation. In fact, the boy is told that he is a man and must get a job  long before he knows that he is a man or begins to feel  responsibilities, while he still has all the emotions and dreams of a  boy.    When he is told he must go to work he looks for a job. He does not wait  until he can find the one that fits him. He cannot afford to wait and if  he could, he does not know what job would fit. He takes automatically  the first place he can get, hoping to find a better one, which generally  means an easier one, before very long. It is hard for a boy to stick to  work; too many things are calling him away. Every instinct and emotion  is urging him to play. New feelings and desires are coaxing him from  work. His companions and the boy life in which he has a place urge him  to leave his task. Usually he keeps his job no longer than he can help  and later looks for something else. The chances are great that he will  never find what he wants; that he has not had the preparation or  training for a successful workingman's career, whatever that might be.  He is a doer of odd jobs and of poorly paid work all his life.    He must have some calling and takes the easiest one, which is often a  life of crime. From this start comes the professional criminal  so-called. He may make a business of picking pockets. If this comes to  be his trade it is very hard for him to give it up. There is so strong  an element of chance--he never knows what a pocket will contain--it  gratifies a spirit of adventure. Then it is easy. The wages are much  greater than he could get in any other calling; the hours are short and  it never interferes with his amusements. It is not so dangerous as being  a burglar or a switchman, for he can find an excuse for jostling one in  the street-cars or in a crowd and thus reaching into a pocket.    The burglar is not so apt to be a professional; his is a bolder and more  hazardous trade; if he is caught he is taken from his occupation for a  longer time. The great hazard involved in this trade and also the  physical strength and fitness of those who follow it lead to its  abandonment more frequently than is the case with a pickpocket or a  petty thief. Robbery is seldom a profession. It is usually the crime of  the young and venturesome and almost surely leads to early disaster.  Murder, of course, is never a profession. In a broad way it is the  result of accident or passion, or of relations which are too hard to  endure.    In prison and out, I have talked with scores of these men and boys. I am  sure they rarely tried to deceive me. I have very seldom seen one who  felt that he had done wrong, or had any thought of what the world calls  reformation. A very few have used the current language of those who  talk of reform, but generally they were the weakest and most hopeless of  the lot and usually adopted this attitude to deceive. In almost every  instance where you meet any sign of intelligence, excuses and  explanations are freely made, and these explanations fully justify their  points of view. Often too they tell you in sincerity that they believe  their way of life is too hard and does not pay; that while they cannot  see how they could have done any differently in the past, they believe  their experience has taught them to stick by the rules of the game.    The boy delinquent grows naturally and almost inevitably into the man  criminal. He has generally never learned a trade. No habits have been  formed in his youth to keep him from crime. A life of crime is the only  one open to him, and for this life he has"]]]
