Had most primitive peoples a tradition regarding the flood?  How do  you explain the striking points of similarity between the flood  stories of peoples far removed from each other?    Is there geological evidence that the earth, during human history,  has been completely inundated?    What do you mean by a calamity?  Is it a mere accident, or an  essential factor in the realization of the divine purpose in human  history?    Are appalling calamities, like floods and earthquakes, the result  of the working out of natural laws?  Are they unmitigated evils?  Were the floods in China and the plagues in India, which destroyed  millions of lives, seemingly essential to the welfare of the  surviving inhabitants of those overpopulated lands?    What were the effects of the Chicago fire and the San Francisco  earthquake upon these cities?  How far was the development of the  modern commission form of city government one of the direct results  of the Galveston flood?    To what extent is the modern progress in sanitation due to natural  calamities?  What calamities?    Is a great calamity often necessary to arouse the inhabitants of a  city or nation to the development of their resources and to the  realisation of their highest possibilities?  What illustrations can  you cite?    How do changes in the environment of men affect the moral quality  of their acts?  How do circumstances affect the kind of act that  will be successful?  During the Chinese revolution of 1912 in  Peking and Nanking, looting leaders of mobs and plundering soldiers  when captured were promptly decapitated without trial.  Was such an  act right?  Was it necessary?  What conditions would justify such  an act in the United States?  Would the same act tend equally to  preserve the government in both countries?      _Subjects for Further Study_.    (1) Flood Stories among Primitive Peoples.

ABRAHAM, THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF HIS RACE.--Gen. 12:1-8; 13:1-13;  16; 18, 19; 21:7; 22:1-19.    _Parallel Readings_.      _Hist. Bible_ I, 73-94.    _Prin of Pol_., 160-175.    Jehovah said to Abraham, Go forth from thy country, and from thy  kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will show  thee, that I may make of thee a great nation; and I will surely  bless thee, and make thy name great, so that thou shalt be a  blessing, I will also bless them that bless thee, and him that  curseth thee will I curse, so that all the families of the earth  shall ask for themselves a blessing like thine own.  So Abraham  went forth, as Jehovah had commanded him.--Gen. 12:1-4.  (_Hist.  Bible_.)    By faith Abraham when he was called, obeyed to go out into a place  which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out not  knowing whither he went.  By faith he became a sojourner in the  land of promise as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with  Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; for he  looked for the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker  is God.--_Heb_. 11:8-10.    He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life  for my sake shall find it--_Matt_. 10:39.      I.    THE PROPHETIC STORIES ABOUT ABRAHAM.    Many Biblical scholars claim that the data point to variant  versions of the different stories about Abraham.  Thus, for  example, there are two accounts of his deceptions regarding Sarah,  one in 12:9-13:1, and the other in 20:1-17.  The oldest version of  the story they believe is found in 26:1-14 and is told not of  Abraham but of Isaac, whose character it fits far more  consistently.  Similarly there are three accounts of the covenant  with Abimelech (Gen. 21:22-31, 21:25-34, and 26:15-33).  The two  accounts of the expulsion of Hagar and the birth of Ishmael, in  Genesis 16:1-16 and 21:1-20 differ rather widely in details.  In  one account Hagar is expelled and Ishmael is born after the birth  of Isaac, and in the other before that event.  Do these variant  versions indicate that they were drawn from different groups of  narratives?  The differences in detail are in general closely  parallel to those which the New Testament student finds in the  different accounts of the same events or teachings in the life of  Jesus.  They suggest to many that the author of the book of Genesis  was eager to preserve each and every story regarding Abraham.  Instead, however, of preserving intact the different groups of  stories, as in the case of the Gospels, they have been combined  with great skill.  Sometimes, as in the case of the expulsion of  Hagar, the two versions are introduced at different points in the  life of the patriarch.  More commonly the two or more versions are  closely interwoven, giving a composite narrative that closely  resembles Tatian's Diatessaron which was one continuous narrative  of the life and teachings of Jesus, based on quotations from each  of the four Gospels.   Fortunately, if this theory is right, the  group of stories most fully quoted and therefore best preserved is  the early Judean prophetic narratives.  When these are separated  from the later parallels they give a marvelously complete and  consistent portrait of Abraham.      II.    THE MEANING OF THE EARLY PROPHETIC STORIES ABOUT ABRAHAM.    Read the prophetic stories regarding Abraham (_Hist. Bible_ I, 73,  74, 79-81, 84-87, 90-92).  Are these stories to be regarded simply  as chapters from the biography of the early ancestor of the Hebrews  or, like the story of the Garden of Eden, do they have a deeper, a  more universal moral and religious significance?  Back of the story  of Abraham's call and settlement in Canaan clearly lies the  historic fact that the ancestors of the Hebrews as nomads migrated  from the land of Aram to seek for themselves and their descendants  a permanent home in the land of Canaan.  Abraham, whose name in  Hebrew means, \"Exalted Father,\" or as it was later interpreted,  \"Father of a Multitude,\" naturally represents this historic  movement, but the story of his call and settlement in Canaan has a  larger meaning and value.  It simply and vividly illustrates the  eternal truths that (1) God guides those who will be guided.  (2)  He reveals himself alone to those who seek a revelation.  (3) His  revelations come along the path of duty and are confined to no  place or land.  (4) For those who will be led by him God has in  store a noble destiny.  (5) Blessed are the peacemakers for they  shall be called the children of God.  (6) Blessed are the meek for  they shall inherit the earth.  Thus this marvelous story presents  certain of the noblest fruits of Israel's spiritual experiences.  Incidentally it also deals with the relationship between the  Hebrews and their neighbors, the Moabites, across the Jordan and  the Dead Sea, for Lot in these earlier stories stands as the  traditional ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites.  It is evident  that, like the opening narratives of Genesis, this story aimed to  explain existing conditions, as well as to illustrate the deeper  truths of life.    Similarly the story of the expulsion of Hagar, it is thought, aims  primarily to explain the origin of Israel's foes, the nomadic  Ishmaelites, who lived south of Canaan.  In the inscriptions of the  Assyrian king Sennacherib, Hargaranu is the name of an Aramean  tribe.  A tribe bearing a similar name is also mentioned in the  south Arabian inscriptions.  The Hagar of the story is a typical  daughter of the desert.  When she became the mother of a child, the  highest honor that could come to a Semitic woman, she could not  resist the temptation to taunt Sarah.  In keeping with early  Semitic customs Sarah had full authority to demand the expulsion of  Hagar, for in the eye of the law the slave wife was her property.  The tradition of the revelation to Hagar also represented the  popular explanation of the sanctity of the famous desert shrine  Beer-lahal-roi.  Like most of the prophetic stories, this narrative  teaches deeper moral lessons.  Chief among these is the broad truth  that the sphere of God's care and blessing was by no means limited  to Israel.  To the outcast and needy he ever comes with his message  of counsel and promise.  Was Abraham right or wrong in yielding to  Sarah's wish?  Was Sarah right or wrong in her attitude toward  Hagar?  Was Hagar's triumphal attitude toward Sarah natural?  Was  it right?    In the story of the destruction of Sodom Lot appears as the central  figure.  His choice of the fertile plain of the Jordan had brought  him into close contact with its inhabitants, the Canaanites.  Abandoning his nomadic life, he had become a citizen, of the  corrupt city of Sodom.  When at last Jehovah had determined to  destroy the city because of its wickedness, Abraham persistently  interceded that it be spared.  Its wickedness proved, however, too  great for pardon.  Lot, who,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#9)"],[1,"Human beings we  refer to it as \"personality.\"    After a little pause, seeing that no one offered a suggestion as to the  identity of the owner, Strann said, softly: \"That hoss is mine.\"    It caused a stir in the crowd of his followers. In the mountain-desert  one may deal lightly with a man's wife and lift a random cow or two and  settle the score, at need, with a snug \"forty-five\" chunk of lead. But  with horses it is different. A horse in the mountain-desert lies outside  of all laws--and above all laws. It is greater than honour and dearer  than love, and when a man's horse is taken from him the men of the  desert gather together and hunt the thief whether it be a day or whether  it be a month, and when they have reached him they shoot him like a dog  and leave his flesh to the buzzards and his bones to the merciless  stars. For all of this there is a reason. But Jerry Strann swung from  his mount, tossed the reins over the head of the chestnut, and walked  towards the black with hungry eyes. He was careless, also, and venturing  too close--the black whirled with his sudden, catlike agility, and two  black hoofs lashed within a hair's breadth of the man's shoulder. There  was a shout from the crowd, but Jerry Strann stepped back and smiled so  that his teeth showed.    \"Boys,\" he said, but he was really speaking to himself, \"there's nothing  in the world I want as bad as I want that hoss. Nothing! I'm going to  buy him; where's the owner?\"    \"Don't look like a hoss a man would want to sell, Jerry,\" came a  suggestion from the cavalcade, who had dismounted and now pressed behind  their leader.    Jerry favoured the speaker with another of his enigmatic smiles: \"Oh,\"  he chuckled, \"he'll sell, all right! Maybe he's inside. You gents stick  out here and watch for him; I'll step inside.\"    And he strode through the swinging doors of the saloon.    It was a dull time of day for O'Brien, so he sat with his feet on the  edge of the bar and sipped a tall glass of beer; he looked up at the  welcome click of the doors, however, and then was instantly on his feet.  The good red went out of his face and the freckles over his nose stood  out like ink marks.    \"There's a black hoss outside,\" said Jerry, \"that I'm going to buy.  Where's the owner?\"    \"Have a drink,\" said the bartender, and he forced an amiable smile.    \"I got business on my hands, not drinking,\" said Jerry Strann.    \"Lost your chestnut?\" queried O'Brien in concern.    \"The chestnut was all right until I seen the black. And now he ain't a  hoss at all. Where's the gent I want?\"    The bartender had fenced for time as long as possible.    \"Over there,\" he said, and pointed.    It was a slender fellow sitting at a table in a corner of the long  room, his sombrero pushed back on his head. He was playing solitaire and  his back was towards Jerry Strann, who now made a brief survey, hitched  his cartridge belt, and approached the stranger with a grin. The man did  not turn; he continued to lay down his cards with monotonous regularity,  and while he was doing it he said in the gentlest voice that had ever  reached the ear of Jerry Strann: \"Better stay where you are, stranger.  My dog don't like you.\"    And Jerry Strann perceived, under the shadow of the table, a blacker  shadow, huge and formless in the gloom, and two spots of incandescent  green twinkling towards him. He stopped; he even made a step back; and  then he heard a stifled chuckle from the bartender.    If it had not been for that untimely mirth of O'Brien's probably nothing  of what followed would have passed into the history of the Three B's.          CHAPTER VIII    THE GIFT-HORSE      \"Your dog is your own dog,\" remarked Jerry Strann, still to the back of  the card-laying stranger, \"but this ain't your back-yard. Keep your eye  on him, or I'll fix him so he won't need watching!\"    So saying he made another step forward, and it brought a snarl from the  dog; not one of those high-whining noises, but a deep guttural that  sounded like indrawn breath. The gun of Jerry Strann leaped into his  hand.    \"Bart,\" said the gentle-voiced stranger, \"lie down and don't talk.\" And  he turned in his chair, pulled his hat straight, and looked mildly upon  the gunman. An artist would have made much of that picture, for there  was in this man, as in Strann, a singular portion of beauty. It was not,  however, free from objection, for he had not the open manliness of the  larger of the two. Indeed, a feminine grace and softness marked him; his  wrists were as round as a girl's, and his hands as slender and as  delicately finished. Whether it be the white-hot sun of summer or the  hurricane snows of winter, the climate of the mountain-desert roughens  the skin, and it cuts away spare flesh, hewing out the face in angles;  but with this man there were no rough edges, but all was smoothed over  and rounded with painful care; as if nature had concentrated in that  birth to show what she could do. Such fine workmanship, perhaps, would  be appreciated more by women than by men; for men like a certain weight  and bulk of bone and muscle--whereas this fellow seemed as light of body  as he was of hand. He sat now watching Strann with the utmost gravity.  He had very large brown eyes of a puzzling quality; perhaps that was  because there seemed to be no thought behind them and one caught the  mystery and the wistfulness of some animals from a glance at him.    The effect of that glance on Strann was to make him grin again, and he  at once banished the frown from his forehead and put away his gun; the  big dog had slunk deeper into the shadow and closer to his master.    \"I'm Strann. Maybe you've heard of me.\"    \"My name is Barry,\" said the other. \"I'm sorry that I haven't heard of  you before.\"    And the sound of his voice made Jerry Strann grin again; it was such a  low, soft voice with the velvet of a young girl's tone in it; moreover,  the brown eyes seemed to apologise for the ignorance concerning Strann's  name.    \"You got a hoss out in front.\"    A nod of agreement.    \"What's your price?\"    \"None.\"    \"No price? Look here,\" argued Strann, \"everything's got a price, and I  got to have that hoss, understand? _Got_ to! I ain't bargaining. I won't  try to beat you down. You just set a figger and I'll cover it. I guess  that's square!\"    \"He ain't a gentle hoss,\" said Barry. \"Maybe you wouldn't like him.\"    \"Oh, that's all right about being gentle,\" chuckled Strann. Then he  checked his mirth and stared piercingly at the other to make out if  there were a secret mockery. It could not, however, be possible. The  eyes were as gravely apologetic as ever. He continued: \"I seen the  hell-fire in him. That's what stopped me like a bullet. I like 'em that  way. Much rather have 'em with a fight. Well, let's have your price.  Hey, O'Brien, trot out your red-eye; I'm going to do some business  here!\"    O'Brien came hastily, with drinks, and while they waited Strann queried  politely: \"Belong around these parts?\"    \"No,\" answered the other softly.    \"No? Where you come from?\"    \"Over there,\" said Barry, and waved a graceful hand towards half the  points of the compass.    \"H-m-m!\" muttered Strann, and once more he bent a keen gaze upon his  companion. The drinks were now placed before them. \"Here,\" he concluded,  \"is to the black devil outside!\" And he swallowed the liquor at a gulp,  but as he replaced the empty glass on the table he observed, with  breathless amazement, that the whiskey glass of the stranger was still  full; he had drunk his chaser!    \"Now, by God!\" said Strann in a ringing voice, and struck a heavy hand  upon the top of the table. He regained his control, however, instantly.  \"Now about that price!\"    \"I don't know what horses are worth,\" replied Barry.    \"To start, then--five hundred bucks in cold cash--gold!--for  your--what's his name?\"    \"Satan.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"Satan.\"    \"H-m-m!\" murmured Strann again. \"Five hundred for Satan, then. How about  it?\"    \"If you can ride him,\" began the stranger.    \"Oh, hell,\" smiled Strann with a large and careless gesture, \"I'll  _ride_ him, all right.\"    \"Then I would let you take him for nothing,\" concluded Barry.    \"You'd--what?\" said Strann. Then he rose slowly from his chair and  shouted; instantly the swinging doors broke open and a throng of faces  appeared at the gap. \"Boys, this gent here is going to give me the  black--ha, ha, ha!--if I can ride him!\" He turned back on Barry.  \"They've heard it,\" he concluded, \"and this bargain is going to stick  just this way. If your hoss can throw me the deal's off. Eh?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" nodded the brown-eyed man.    \"What's the idea?\" asked one of Jerry's followers as the latter stepped  through the doors of the saloon onto the street.    \"I dunno,\" said Jerry. \"That gent looks kind of simple; but it ain't my  fault if he made a rotten bargain. Here, you!\"    And he seized the bridle-reins of the black stallion. Speed, lightning  speed, was what saved him, for the instant his fingers touched the  leather Satan twisted his head and snapped like an angry dog. The teeth  clicked beside Strann's shoulder as he leaped back. He laughed savagely.    \"That'll be took out of him,\" he announced, \"and damned quick!\"    Here the voice of Barry was heard, saying: \"I'll help you mount, Mr.  Strann.\" And he edged his way through the little crowd until he stood at  the head of the stallion.    \"Look out!\" warned Strann in real alarm, \"or he'll take your head off!\"    But Barry was already beside his horse, and, with his back towards those  vicious teeth, he drew the reins over its head. As for the stallion, it  pricked one ear forward and then the other, and muzzled the man's  shoulder confidingly. There was a liberal chorus of astonished oaths  from the gathering.    \"I'll hold his head while you get on,\" suggested Barry, turning his mild  eyes upon Strann again.    \"Well,\" muttered the big man, \"may I be eternally"]]]
