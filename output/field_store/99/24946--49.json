A good brown japan can be prepared by separately heating equal  quantities of amber and asphaltum, and adding to each one-half the  quantity by weight of boiled linseed oil. Both compounds are then  mixed together. Copal resin may be substituted for the amber, but it  is not so durable. Oil varnish made from amber is highly elastic. If  it is used to protect tin-plate printing, when the plates after  stoving have been subsequently rolled so as to distort the letters,  the varnish has in no way suffered, and its surface remains unbroken.    A bronzing composition for coating iron consists of 120 parts mercury,  10 parts tin, 20 parts green vitriol, 120 parts water, and 15 parts  hydrochloric acid of 1.2 specific gravity.          SECTION VI.    PROCESSES FOR TIN-PLATING.      In these days of making everything look what it is not, perhaps the  best and cheapest substitute for silver as a white coating for table  ware, culinary vessels, and the many articles requiring such a  coating, is pure tin. It does not compare favourably with silver in  point of hardness or wearing qualities, but it costs very much less  than silver, is readily applied, and can be easily kept clean and  bright. In tinning hollow ware on the inside the metal article is  first thoroughly cleansed by pickling it in dilute muriatic or  sulphuric acid and then scouring it with fine sand. It is then heated  over a fire to about the melting-point of tin, sprinkled with powdered  resin, and partly filled with melted pure grain tin covered with resin  to prevent its oxidation. The vessel is then quickly turned and rolled  about in every direction, so as to bring every part of the surface to  be covered in contact with the molten metal. The greater part of the  tin is then thrown out and the surface rubbed over with a brush of tow  to equalize the coating; and if not satisfactory the operation must be  repeated. The vessels usually tinned in this manner are of copper and  brass, but with a little care in cleaning and manipulating, iron can  also be satisfactorily tinned by this means. The vessels to be tinned  must always be sufficiently hot to keep the metal contained in them  thoroughly fused. This is covering by contact with melted tin.    The amalgam process is not so much used as it was formerly. It  consists in applying to the clean and dry metallic surface a film of a  pasty amalgam of tin with mercury, and then exposing the surface to  heat, which volatilizes the latter, leaving the tin adhering to the  metal.    The immersion process is the best adapted to coating articles of brass  or copper. When immersed in a hot solution of tin properly prepared  the metal is precipitated upon their surfaces. One of the best  solutions for this purpose is the following:--      Ammonia alum              17-1/4 oz.    Boiling                   12-1/2 lb.    Protochloride of tin       1 oz.    The articles to be tinned must be first thoroughly cleansed, and then  kept in the hot solution until properly whitened. A better result will  be obtained by using the following bath, and placing the pieces in  contact with a strip of clean zinc, also immersed:--      Bitartrate of potassium      14 oz.    Soft water                   24 \"    Protochloride of tin          1 \"    It should be boiled for a few minutes before using.    The following is one of the best solutions for plating with tin by the  battery process:--      Potassium pyrophosphate      12     oz.    Protochloride of tin          4-1/2 \"    Water                        20     \"    The anode or feeding-plate used in this bath consists of pure Banca  tin. This plate is joined to the positive (copper or carbon) pole of  the battery, while the work is suspended from a wire connected with  the negative (zinc) pole. A moderately strong battery is required, and  the work is finished by scratch-brushing.    In Weigler's process a bath is prepared by passing washed chlorine gas  into a concentrated aqueous solution of stannous chloride to  saturation, and expelling excess of gas by warming the solution, which  is then diluted with about ten volumes of water, and filtered, if  necessary. The articles to be plated are pickled in dilute sulphuric  acid, and polished with fine sand and a scratch-brush, rinsed in  water, loosely wound round with zinc wire or tape, and immersed in the  bath for ten or fifteen minutes at ordinary temperatures. The coating  is finished with the scratch-brush and whiting. By this process  cast-or wrought-iron, steel, copper, brass, and lead can be tinned  without a separate battery. The only disadvantage of the process is  that the bath soon becomes clogged up with zinc chloride, and the tin  salt must be frequently removed. In Hern's process a bath composed  of--      Tartaric acid             2 oz.    Water                   100 \"    Soda                      3 \"    Protochloride of tin      3 \"    is employed instead of the preceding. It requires a somewhat longer  exposure to properly tin articles in this than in Weigler's bath.  Either of these baths may be used with a separate battery.          SECTION VII.    GALVANIZING.      Galvanizing, as a protecting surface for large articles, such as enter  into the construction of bridges, roofs, and shipwork, has not quite  reached the point of appreciation that possibly the near future may  award to it. Certain fallacies existed for a long time as to the  relative merits of the dry or molten and the wet or electrolytical  methods of galvanizing. The latter was found to be costly and slow,  and the results obtained were erratic and not satisfactory, and soon  gave place to the dry or molten bath process, as in practice at the  present day; but the difficulty of management in connexion with large  baths of molten material, and the deterioration of the bath, and other  mechanical causes, limit the process to articles of comparatively  small size and weight. The electro deposition of zinc has been subject  to many patents, and the efforts to introduce it have been lamentable  in both a mechanical and financial sense. Most authorities recommend a  current density of 18 or 20 amperes per square foot of cathode  surface, and aqueous solutions of zinc sulphate, acetate or chloride,  ammonia, chloride or tartrate, as being the most suitable for  deposition. Electrolytes made by adding caustic potash or soda to a  suitable zinc salt have been found to be unworkable in practice on  account of the formation of an insoluble zinc oxide on the surface of  the anode and the resultant increased electrical resistance; the  electrolytes are also constantly getting out of order, as more metal  is taken out of the solution than could possibly be dissolved from the  anodes by the chemicals set free on account of this insoluble scale or  furring up of the anodes, which sometimes reaches one-eighth of an  inch in thickness. To all intents and purposes the deposits obtained  from acid solutions under favourable circumstances are fairly adhesive  when great care has been exercised to thoroughly scale and clean the  surface to be coated, which is found to be the principal difficulty in  the application of any electro-chemical process for copper, lead, or  tin, as well as for zinc, and that renders even the application of  paint or other brush compounds to futile unless honestly complied  with. Unfortunately these acid zinc coatings are of a transitory  nature, Their durability being incomparable with hot galvanizing, as  the deposit is porous and retains some of the acid salts, which cause  a wasting of the zinc, and consequently the rusting of the iron or  steel. Castings coated with acid zinc rust comparatively quickly, even  when the porosity has been reduced by oxidation, aggravated no doubt  by some of the corroding agents--sal-ammoniac, for instance--being  forced into the pores of the metal. Other matters of serious moment in  the electro-zincing process, apart from the slowness of the operation,  were the uncertain nature, thickness, and extent of the coating on  articles of irregular shape, and the formation of loose, dark-coloured  patches on the work; the unhealthy and non-metallic look and want of  brilliancy and the lustre prevented engineers and the trade from  accepting the process or its results, except for the commoner articles  of use. To obviate any tendency of the paint to peel off from the zinc  surface, as it generally manifests a disposition to do, it is  recommended to coat all the zinc surfaces, previous to painting them,  with the following compound: 1 part chloride of copper, 1 part nitrate  of copper, 1 part sal-ammoniac, dissolved in 61 parts of water, and  then add 1 part commercial hydrochloric acid. When the zinc is brushed  over with this mixture it oxidizes the surface, turns black, and dries  in from twelve to twenty-four hours, and may then be painted over  without any danger of peeling. Another and more quickly applied  coating consists of, bi-chloride of platinum, 1 part dissolved in 10  parts of distilled water, and applied either by a brush or sponge. It  oxidizes at once, turns black, and resists the weak acids, rain, and  the elements generally.    Zinc surfaces, after a brief exposure to the air, become coated with a  thin film of oxide--insoluble in water--which adheres tenaciously,  forming a protective coating to the underlying zinc. So long as the  zinc surface remains intact, the underlying metal is protected from  corrosive action, but a mechanical or other injury to the zinc coating  that exposes the metal beneath, in the presence of moisture causes a  very rapid corrosion to be started, the galvanic action being changed  from the zinc positive to zinc negative, and the iron, as the positive  element in the circuit, is corroded instead of the zinc. When  galvanized iron is immersed in a corrosive liquid, the zinc is  attacked in preference to the iron,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#9)"],[1,"business; so the idea is to have just Fred and the professor--and you,  if you'll go--and me to go and attend to the assessments. All the  other names will be dummy names--well, silent partners is a better  word--and we can control a tremendously valuable tract that way. How  about a henna rinse, Marion? Would it be worth while?\"    \"Why, a henna rinse would brighten your hair, Kate--and lots of nice  women have them. But you'll have to have a shampoo, you know. The  henna rinse is used with a shampoo. I believe I'd have one if I were  you, Kate. You never could tell it in the world. And it's good for the  hair, too. It--\"    \"Fred is _so_ disagreeable about such things. But if it couldn't be  told--\" Kate began to doubt again. \"Does it cost extra?\"    \"Fifty cents--but it does brighten the hair. It brings out the natural  color--there is an auburn tint--\"    \"But I really meant to have a manicure today. And we can't talk in the  manicure parlor--those tables are crowded together so! I've a  tremendous lot to tell you, too. Which would you have, Marion?\"    Miss Rose dutifully considered the matter while she continued the  scalp massage. Before they had decided definitely upon the  extravagance of a henna rinse, which was only a timid sort of  experiment and at best a mere compromise art and nature, Marion had  applied the tonic. It seemed a shame to waste that now with a shampoo,  and she did not dare to go for another dish of the tonic; so Kate  sighed and consoled herself with a dollar saved, and went without the  manicure also.    Rather incoherently she returned to her subject, but she did not  succeed in giving Miss Rose anything more than a confused idea of a  trip somewhere that would really be an outing, and a tremendous  opportunity to make thousands of dollars with very little effort. This  sounded alluring. Marion mentally cancelled a date with a party going  to Venice that evening, and agreed to meet Kate at six o'clock, and  hear more about it.    In the candy shop where they ate, her mind was even more receptive to  tremendous opportunities for acquiring comparative wealth with  practically no initial expense and no effort whatever. Not being  subjected to the distraction of a beauty parlor, Kate forgot to use  her carefully modulated, elocutionary voice, and buzzed with details.    \"It's away up in the northern part of the State somewhere, in the  mountains. You know timber land is going to be tremendously  valuable--it is now, in fact. And this tract of beautiful big trees  can be gotten and flumed--or something--down to a railroad that taps  the country. It's in Forest Reserve, you see, and can't be bought by  the lumber companies. I had the professor explain it all to me again,  after I left the Martha, so I could tell you.    \"A few of us can club together and take mining claims on the  land--twenty acres apiece. All we have to do is a hundred dollars'  worth of work--just digging holes around on it, or something--every  year till five hundred dollars' worth is done. Then we can get our  deed--or whatever it is--and sell the timber.\"    \"Well, _what_ do you know about _that_!\" Marion exclaimed  ecstatically, leaning forward across the little table with her hands  clasped. Nature had given her a much nicer voice than Kate's, and the  trite phrase acquired a pretty distinctiveness just from the way she  said it. \"But--would you have to stay five years, Kate?\" she added  dubiously.    \"No, that's the beauty of it, you can do all the five hundred dollars'  worth in one year, Marion.\"    \"Five hundred dollars' worth of digging holes in the ground!\" Marion  gasped, giggling a little. \"Good night!\"    \"Now please wait until you hear the rest of it!\" Kate's tone sharpened  a little with impatience. She moved a petulant elbow while a tired  waitress placed two glasses of water and a tiny plate of white and  brown bread upon the table. The minute the girl's back was turned upon  them she cast a cautious eye around the clattering throng and leaned  forward.    \"Four men--men with a little capital--are going into it, and pay Fred  and the professor for doing their assessment work. Four five-hundreds  will make two thousand dollars that we'll get out of them, just for  looking after their interests. And we'll have our twenty acres apiece  of timber--and you've no _idea_ what a tremendous lot of money that  will bring, considering the investment. Fred's worked so hard lately  that he's all run down and looks miserable. The doctor told him the  mountains would do him a world of good. And the professor wants to do  something definite and practical--they are filling up the college with  student-teachers, willing to teach some certain subject for the  instruction they'll get in some other--and they're talking about  cutting the professor's salary. He says he will not endure another  cut--he simply cannot, and--\"    \"And support an elocutionist?\"    \"Now, hush! It isn't--\"    \"Do I draw any salary as chaperone, Kate?\"    \"Now, if you don't stop, I'll not tell you another thing!\" Kate took a  sip of water to help hide a little confusion, clutching mentally at  the practical details of the scheme. \"Where was I?\"    \"Cutting Doug's salary. Is it up on a mountain, or up in the State,  that you said the place was? I'd like being on a mountain, I  believe--did you ever see such hot nights as we're having?\"    \"It's up both,\" Kate stated briefly. \"You'd love it, Marion. There's a  log house, and right beside it is a trout stream. And it's only six  miles from the railroad, and _good_ road up past the place. A man who  has been up there told Doug--the professor. Tourists just _flock_ in  there. And right up on top of the mountain, within walking distance of  our claims, is a lake, Marion! And great trout in it, that long!--you  can see them swimming all around in schools, the water is so clear.  And there is no inlet or outlet, and no bottom. The water is just as  clear and as blue as the sky, the man told the professor. It's so  clear that they actually call it Crystal Lake!\"    \"Well, _what_ do you know about that!\" breathlessly murmured Marion in  her crooning voice. \"A lake like that on top of a mountain--in  weather like this, doesn't it sound like heaven?\" She began to pick  the pineapple out of her fruit salad, dabbing each morsel in the tiny  mound of whipped cream.    \"We'd need some outing clothes, of course. I've been thinking that a  couple of plain khaki suits--you know--and these leggings that lace  down the side, would be all we'd really need. I wish you'd go out home  with me instead of going to a show. Fred will be home, and he can  explain the details of this thing better than I can. If it were a  difficult stanza of Browning, now--but I haven't much talent for  business. And seriously, Marion, you must know all about this before  you really say yes or no. And it's time you had some real object in  life--time you settled down to regard your life seriously. I love you  just the way you are, dear, but for your own sake you must learn to  think for yourself and not act so much upon impulse. I couldn't bear  to go off without you, and stay a whole year, maybe--but if you should  go, not knowing just what it was going to be like, and then be  disappointed--you see, dear, you might come to blaming poor Kate.\"    \"Why, I wouldn't do anything of the kind! Even if it did turn out to  be something I didn't care for, it would be so much better than  staying here with you gone, that I don't see how I could mind very  much. You know, Kate, I'm just crazy about the country. I'd like to  sleep right outside! And I think a log cabin is the dearest way to  live--don't you? And we'd hike, wouldn't we?--up to the lake and all  around. I've got enough money to buy a gun, and if there's any hunting  around there, we'll hunt! Kate, down in my heart I'm sick of massaging  old ladies' double chins and kidding them into thinking they look  young! And anyway,\" she added straightforwardly, \"I don't suppose I'll  be at the Martha much longer. They're going to let a lot of us girls  out, and I'm almost sure to be one of them. There's enough of the  older girls to do all the work there is now, till the tourist season  begins again in the fall. I couldn't get in anywhere else, this time  of the year, so I'd just about have to go out to one of the beaches  and get a little tent house or something with some of the girls, and  fool around until something opened up in the fall. And even if you  live in your bathing suit all day, Kate, you just can't get by without  spending a little money.\"    \"Well, of course, you'd stay with me if I were here. I wouldn't hear  to anything else. And even--why don't you come on out anyway, till we  get ready to start? We could plan so much better. And don't you think,  Marion, it would be much better for you if you didn't wait for the  Martha to let you go but gave them notice instead?\"    \"Quit before I'm invited to leave? I believe I'd better do that, Kate.  It won't be half bad to spring it on the girls that I'm going up in  the mountains for the summer. I'll talk about that lake till--say, I'm  just wild to start. How soon do you think it will be? Fred will have  to teach me how to trout-fish--or whatever you call it. Only think of  stepping out of our log cabin and catching trout, just any time you  want to! And, Kate, I really am going to buy a gun. Down on Spring, in  that sporting-goods house--you know, the one on the corner--they have  got the cutest rifles! And by the way, they had some of the best  looking outing suits in the window the other day. I'm going in there  when I come down in the morning.\"    \"Let Fred advise you about the rifle before you buy. Fred's  tremendously clever about nature stuff, Marion. He'll know just what  you want. I think a gun will maybe be necessary. You know there are  bear--\"    \"Oh, good night!\" cried Marion. But in the next breath she added, \"I  wonder"]]]
