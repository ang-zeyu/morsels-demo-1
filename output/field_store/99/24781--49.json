The language spoken here by the white people was that of the mother  country--Portuguese. The ecclesiastics in general could converse in  Latin; and the negro slaves spoke a corrupt mixture of their own tongue  with that of the people of the town. The native Indians retained their  own language, and could be distinctly discerned from the natives of  Guinea, as well by the colour of the skin, as by the hair and the  features of the face. Some few of the military conversed in French; but  this language was in general little used.    The town appeared to be well supplied with water, which was conveyed into  it from a great distance by means of an aqueduct (or carioca) which in  one place having to cross a road or public way was raised upon a double  row of strong lofty arches, forming an object that from the bay, and at  the entrance of the harbour, added considerably to the beauty of the  imagery. From this aqueduct the water was received into stone fountains,  constructed with capacious basins, whither the inhabitants sent their  linen, to have the dirt rather beaten than washed out of it, by slaves.  One of these fountains of a modern construction was finished with great  taste and neatness of execution.    We also observed several large and rich convents in the town. The chief  of these were, the Benedictine and the Carmelite; one dedicated to St.  Anthony, another to Our Lady of Assistance, and another to St. Theresa.  The two last were for the reception of nuns; and of the two, that of St.  Theresa was reported the severest in its religious duties, and the  strictest in its restraints and regulations. The convent D. Ajuda, or of  Assistance, received as pensioners, or boarders, the widows of officers,  and young ladies having lost their parents, who were allowed to remain,  conforming to the rules of the convent, until married, or otherwise  provided for by their friends. There were many inferior convents and  churches, and the whole were under the spiritual direction of a bishop,  whose palace was in the town, a short distance from one of the principal  convents.    Near the carioca, or aqueduct, stood the seminary of St. Joseph, where  the servants of the church received their education, adopting on their  entrance the clerical habit and tonsure. The chapel to the seminary was  neat, and we were conducted by a sensible well-informed father of the  Benedictine Order to a small library belonging to it.    To a stranger nothing could appear more remarkable than the innumerable  religious processions which were to be seen at all hours in this town. At  the close of every day an image of the Virgin was borne in procession  through the principal streets, the attendants arrayed in white surplices,  and bearing in their hands lighted tapers; chanting at the same time  praises to her in Latin. To this, as well as to all other religious  processions, the guards turned out, grounded their arms, kneeled, and  showed the most submissive marks of respect; and the bells of each church  or convent in the vicinity of their progress sounded a peal while they  were passing.    Every church, chapel, or convent, being under the auspices of some  tutelary saint, particular days were set apart as the festival of each,  which were opened with public prayers, and concluded with processions,  music, and fireworks. The church and altars of the particular saint whose  protection was to be solicited were decorated with all the splendor of  superstition*, and illuminated both within and without. During several  hours after dark, on these solemn festivals, the inhabitants might be  seen walking to and from the church, dressed in their best habiliments,  accompanied by their children, and attended by their slaves and their  carriages.    [* We were informed that they never permitted any base metals near their  altars, all their vessels, etc. being of the purest gold or silver.]    An instance was related to us, of the delay that was thrown in the way of  labour by this extravagant parade of public worship, and the strict  observance of saints' days, which, though calculated, no doubt, by the  glare which surrounds the shrine, and decorates the vesture of its  priests, to impress and keep in awe the minds of the lower sort of  people, Indians and slaves, had nevertheless been found to be not without  its evil effects:    A ship from Lisbon, laden chiefly with bale goods, was burnt to the  water's edge, with her whole cargo, and much private property, the fourth  day after her anchoring in the harbour, owing to the intervention of a  sabbath and two saints' days which unfortunately ensued that of her  arrival. All that could be done was, to tow the vessel on shore near the  Island of Cobres, clear of the shipping in the bay, where grounding, she  was totally consumed. One of the passengers, whose whole property was  destroyed with her, came out to fill an high judicial employment, and had  with all his family removed from Lisbon for that purpose, bringing with  him whatever he had valuable in Europe.    At a corner of almost every street in the town we observed a small altar,  dedicated generally to the Virgin, and decorated with curtains and lamps.  Before these altars, at the close of every evening, the negroes assembled  to chant their vespers, kneeling together in long rows in the street. The  policy of thus keeping the minds of so large a body, as that of the black  people in this town, not only in constant employment, but in awe and  subjection, by the almost perpetual exercise of religious worship, was  too obvious to need a comment. In a colony where the servants were more  numerous than the masters, a military, however excellent, ought not to be  the only control; to keep the mind in subjection must be as necessary as  to provide a check on the personal conduct.    The trades-people of the town have adopted a regulation, which must prove  of infinite convenience to strangers, as well as to the inhabitants. We  found the people of one profession or trade dwelling together in one,  two, or as many streets as were necessary for their numbers to occupy.  Thus, for instance, the apothecaries resided in the principal street, or  Rua Direita, as it was named; one or more streets were assigned to the  jewellers; and a whole district appeared to be occupied by the mercers.  By this regulation the labour of traversing from one street to another,  in search of any article which the purchaser might wish to have a choice  of, was avoided*. Most of the articles were from Europe, and were sold at  a high price.    [* The same useful regulation is observed at Aleppo.]    Houses here were built, after the fashion of the mother-country, with a  small wooden balcony over the entrance; but to the eye of one accustomed  to the cheerful appearance of glass windows, a certain sombre cast seemed  to pervade even their best and widest streets, the light being conveyed  through window-frames of close lattice-work. Some of these, indeed, being  decorated on the outside with paint and some gilding, rather improved the  look of the houses to which they belonged.    The winter, we were informed, was the only season in which the  inhabitants could make excursions into the country; for when the sun came  to the southward of the Line, the rain, as they most energetically  assured us, descended for between two and three months rather in seas  than in torrents. At this season they confined themselves to their houses  in the town, only venturing out by the unscorching light of the moon, or  at those intervals when the rains were moderated into showers. But,  though the summer season is so extremely hot, the use of the cold bath,  we found, was wholly unknown to the inhabitants.    The women of the town of Rio de Janeiro, being born within the tropics,  could not be expected to possess the best complexions; but their features  were in general expressive--the eye dark and lively, with a striking  eye-brow. The hair was dark, and nature had favoured them with that  ornament in uncommon profusion: this they mostly wore with powder,  strained to a high point before, and tied in several folds behind. By  their parents they were early bred up to much useful knowledge, and were  generally mistresses of the polite accomplishments of music, singing, and  dancing. Their conversation appeared to be lively, at times breaking out  in sallies of mirth and wit, and at others displaying judgment and good  _sense_. In their dress for making or receiving visits, they chiefly  affected silks and gay colours; but in the mornings, when employed in the  necessary duties of the house, a thin but elegant robe or mantle thrown  over the shoulders was the only upper garment worn. Both males and  females were early taught to dress as men and women; and we had many  opportunities of seeing a hoop on a little Donna of three years of age,  and a bag and a sword on a Senor of six. This appearance was as difficult  to reconcile as that of the saints and virgins in their churches being  decorated with powdered perukes, swords, laced clothes, and full-dressed  suits.    Attentions to the women were perhaps carried farther in this place than  is customary in Europe. To a lady, in the presence of a gentleman, a  servant never was suffered to hand even a glass of water, the gentleman  (with a respect approaching to adoration) performing that office; and  these gallantries appeared to be received as the homage due to their  superior rank in the creation. It was said, indeed, that they were not  disinclined to intrigues, but in public the strictest decorum and  propriety of behaviour was always observed in the women, single as well  as married. At houses where several people of both sexes were met  together, the eye, on entering the room, was instantly hurt, at  perceiving the female part of the company ranged and seated by themselves  on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#9)"],[1,"ff--it was a ladybird. She let it creep about on  her hand, between the mountains and valleys of her fingers, until it  came to the tip of her little-finger and flew away.    \"What a tale he'll have to tell about where he has been!\" thought Amrei.  \"A little creature like that is well off indeed--wherever it flies, it  is at home. How the larks are singing! They, too, are well off--they do  not have to think what they ought to say and do. Yonder the butcher,  with his dog, is driving a calf out of the village. The dog's voice is  quite different from the lark's--but then a lark's singing would never  drive a calf along.\"    \"Where's the colt going?\" Coaly Mathew called out of his window to a  young lad who was leading a fine colt away by a halter.    \"Farmer Rodel has sold it,\" was the reply; and presently the colt was  heard neighing farther down the valley. Amrei, who had heard this,  again reflected:    \"Yes, a creature like that can be sold away from its mother, and the  mother hardly knows of it; and whoever pays for it, to him it belongs.  But a person cannot be sold, and he who is unwilling cannot be led away  by a halter. Yonder comes Farmer Rodel and his horses, with a large colt  frisking beside them. You will be put in harness soon, colt, and perhaps  you, too, will be sold. A man cannot be bought--he merely hires himself  out. An animal for its work gets nothing more than its food and drink,  while a person gets money as a reward. Yes, I can be a maid now, and  with my wages I can apprentice Damie--he wants to be a mason. But when  we are at uncle's, Damie won't be as much mine as he is now. Hark! the  starling is flying home to the house which father made for him--he's  singing merrily again. Father made the house for him out of old planks.  I remember his saying that a starling won't go into a house if it's made  of new wood, and I feel just the same. 'You, tree,--now I know--if you  rustle as long as I stay here, I shall remain.'\" And Amrei listened  intently; soon it seemed to her as if the tree were rustling, but again  when she looked up at the branches they were quite still, and she did  not know what it was she heard.    Something was now coming along the road with a great cackling and with a  cloud of dust flying before it. It was a flock of geese returning from  the pasture on the Holderwasen. Amrei abstractedly imitated their  cackling for a long time. Then her eyes closed and she fell asleep.    An entire spring-array of blossoms had burst forth in this young soul.  The budding trees in the valley, as they drank in the evening dew, shed  forth their fragrance over the child who had fallen asleep on her native  soil, from which she could not tear herself.    It had long been dark when she awoke, and a voice was crying:    \"Amrei, where are you?\"    She sat up, but did not answer. She looked wonderingly at the  stars,--it seemed to her as if the voice had come from Heaven. Not until  the call was repeated did she recognize the voice of Black Marianne, and  then she answered:    \"Here I am!\"    Black Marianne now came up and said:    \"Oh, it's good that I have found you! They are like mad all through the  village; one says he saw you in the wood, another that he met you in the  fields, that you were running along, crying, and would listen to no  call. I began to fear that you had jumped into the pond. You need not be  afraid, dear child, you need not run away; nobody can compel you to go  with your uncle.\"    \"And who said that I did not want to go?\" But suddenly a gust of wind  rustled loudly through the branches of the tree. \"But I shall certainly  not go!\" Amrei cried, holding fast to the tree with her hand.    \"Come home--there's a severe storm coming up, and the wind will blow it  here directly,\" urged Marianne.    And so Amrei walked, almost staggered, back to the village with Black  Marianne. What did it mean--that people had seen her running through  field and forest? Or was it only Black Marianne's fancy?    The night was pitch dark, but now and then bright flashes of lightning  illuminated the houses, revealing them in a dazzling glare, which  blinded their eyes and compelled them to stand still. And when the  lightning disappeared, nothing more could be seen. In their own native  village the two seemed as if they were lost, as if they were in a  strange place, and they hastened onward with an uncertain step. The dust  whirled up in eddies, so that at times they could scarcely make any  progress; then, wet with perspiration, they struggled on again, until at  last they reached the shelter of their home, just as the first heavy  drops of rain began to fall. A gust of wind blew open the door, and  Amrei cried:    \"Open, door!\"    She was very likely thinking of a fairy tale, in which a magic door  opens at a mysterious word.          CHAPTER V    ON THE HOLDERWASEN      Accordingly, when her uncle came the next morning, Amrei declared that  she would remain where she was. There was a strange mixture of  bitterness and benevolence in her uncle's reply:    \"Yes, you certainly take after your mother--she would never have  anything to do with us. But I couldn't take Damie alone along with me,  even if he wanted to go; for a long time he wouldn't be able to do  anything but eat bread, whereas you would have been able to earn it  too.\"    Amrei replied that she preferred to do that here at home for the  present, but that if her uncle remained in the same mind, she and her  brother would come to him at some future time. Indeed, the interest her  uncle now expressed for the children, for a moment, almost made her  waver in her resolution, but in her characteristic way she did not  venture to show any signs of it. She merely said:    \"Give my love to your children, and tell them I feel very sorry about  never having seen my nearest relatives; and especially now that they are  going across the seas, since perhaps I shall never see them in my life.\"    Then her uncle stood up quickly, and commissioned Amrei to give his love  to Damie, for he himself had no time to wait to bid him farewell. And  with that he went away.    When Damie came soon afterward and heard of his uncle's departure, he  wanted to run after him, and even Amrei felt a similar impulse. But she  restrained herself and did not yield to it. She spoke and acted as if  she were obeying some one's command in every word she said and in every  movement she made; and yet her thoughts were wandering along the road by  which her uncle had gone. She walked through the village, leading her  brother by the hand, and nodded to all the people she met. She felt just  as if she had been away and was now returning to them all. Her uncle  had wanted to tear her away, and she thought that everybody else must be  as glad that she had not gone, as she was herself. But she soon found  out that they would not only have been glad to let her go, but that they  were positively angry with her because she had not gone. Crappy Zachy  opened his eyes wide at her and said:    \"Child, you have an obstinate head of your own--the whole village is  angry with you for spurning your good fortune. Still, who knows whether  it would have been good fortune? But they call it so now, at any rate,  and everybody that looks at you casts it up to you how much you receive  from the parish. So make haste and get yourself off the public charity  lists.\"    \"But what am I to do?\"    \"Farmer Rodel's wife would like to have you in her service, but the old  man won't listen to it.\"    Amrei very likely felt that henceforward she would have to be doubly  brave, in order to escape the reproaches of her own conscience, as well  as those of others; and so she asked again:    \"Don't you know of anything at all?\"    \"Yes, certainly; but you must not be ashamed of anything--except  begging. Have you not heard that foolish Fridolin yesterday killed two  geese belonging to a farmer's wife? The goosekeeper's place is vacant,  and I advise you to take it.\"    It was soon done. That very noon Amrei drove the geese out to the  Holderwasen, as the pasture on the little hill by the King's Well was  called. Damie loyally helped his sister in doing it.    Black Marianne, however, was very much put out about this new service,  and declared, not without reason:    \"It's something that's remembered against a person an entire lifetime to  have had such a place. People never forget it, and always refer to it;  and later on every one will think twice about taking you into their  service, because they will say: 'Why, that's the goose-girl!' And if any  one does take you, out of compassion, you'll get low wages and bad  treatment, and they'll always say: 'Oh, that's good enough for a  goose-girl.'\"    \"I won't mind that,\" replied Amrei; \"and you have told me hundreds of  times about how a goose-girl became a queen.\"    \"That was in olden times. But who knows?--you belong to the old world.  Sometimes it seems to me that you are not a child at all, and who knows,  you old-fashioned soul, if a wonder won't happen in your case?\"    This hint that she had not yet stood upon the lowest round of the ladder  of honor, but that there was a possibility of her descending even lower  that she was, startled Amrei. For herself she thought nothing of it, but  from that time forth she would not allow Damie to keep the geese with  her. He was a man--or was to be one--and it might do him harm if it were  said of him, later on, that he had kept geese. But, to save her soul,  she could not make this clear to him, and he refused to listen to her.  For it is always thus; at the point where mutual understanding ends,  vexation begins; the inward helplessness translates itself into a  feeling of outward injustice and injury.    Amrei, nevertheless, was almost glad that Damie could remain angry with  her for so many days; for it showed that he was learning how to stand up  against the world and to assert his own will."]]]
