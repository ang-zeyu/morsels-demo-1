This includes the praecordial pains which very  closely resemble those of true angina. The essential difference lies  in the fact that pseudo-angina is independent of structural disease  of the heart and coronary arteries. In true angina there is some  condition within the heart which starts the stimulus sent to the nerve  centres. In pseudo-angina the starting-point is not the heart but  some peripheral or visceral nerve. The impulse passes thence to the  medulla, and so reaching the sensory centres starts a feeling of pain  that radiates into the chest or down the arm. There are three main  varieties:--(1) the reflex, (2) the vaso-motor, (3) the toxic. The  reflex is by far the most common, and is generally due to irritation  from one of the abdominal organs. An attack of pseudo-angina may be  agonizing, the pain radiating through the chest and into the left arm,  but the patient does not usually assume the motionless attitude of  true angina, and the duration of the seizure is usually much longer.  The treatment is that of the underlying neurosis and the prognosis is  a good one, sudden death not occurring.        ANGIOSPERMS. The botanical term \"Angiosperm\" ([Greek: angeion],  receptacle, and [Greek: sperma], seed) was coined in the form  Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as the name of that one of  his primary divisions of the plant kingdom, which included flowering  plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, in contradistinction to  his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic  fruits--the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as  a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by Linnaeus  with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of  the orders of his class Didynamia. Its use with any approach to its  modern scope only became possible after Robert Brown had established  in 1827 the existence of truly naked seeds in the Cycadeae and  Coniferae, entitling them to be correctly called Gymnosperms. From  that time onwards, so long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual,  reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term Angiosperm was  used antithetically by botanical writers, but with varying limitation,  as a group-name for other dicotyledonous plants. The advent in 1851  of Hofmeister's brilliant discovery of the changes proceeding in the  embryo-sac of flowering plants, and his determination of the correct  relationships of these with the Cryptogamia, fixed the true position  of Gymnosperms as a class distinct from Dicotyledons, and the  term Angiosperm then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable  designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than  Gymnosperms, and as including therefore the classes of Dicotyledons  and Monocotyledons. This is the sense in which the term is nowadays  received and in which it is used here.    [v.02 p.0010]    The trend of the evolution of the plant kingdom has been in the  direction of the establishment of a vegetation of fixed habit and  adapted to the vicissitudes of a life on land, and the Angiosperms are  the highest expression of this evolution and constitute the dominant  vegetation of the earth's surface at the present epoch. There is no  land-area from the poles to the equator, where plant-life is possible,  upon which Angiosperms are not found. They occur also abundantly in  the shallows of rivers and fresh-water lakes, and in less number in  salt lakes and in the sea; such aquatic Angiosperms are not, however,  primitive forms, but are derived from immediate land-ancestors.  Associated with this diversity of habitat is great variety in general  form and manner of growth. The familiar duckweed which covers the  surface of a pond consists of a tiny green \"thalloid\" shoot, one, that  is, which shows no distinction of parts--stem and leaf, and a  simple root growing vertically downwards into the water. The great  forest-tree has a shoot, which in the course perhaps of hundreds of  years, has developed a wide-spreading system of trunk and branches,  bearing on the ultimate twigs or branchlets innumerable leaves, while  beneath the soil a widely-branching root-system covers an area of  corresponding extent. Between these two extremes is every conceivable  gradation, embracing aquatic and terrestrial herbs, creeping, erect or  climbing in habit, shrubs and trees, and representing a much greater  variety than is to be found in the other subdivision of seed-plants,  the Gymnosperms.      _Internal structure._    In internal structure also the variety of tissue-formation far exceeds  that found in Gymnosperms (see PLANTS: _Anatomy_). The vascular  bundles of the stem belong to the collateral type, that is to say,  the elements of the wood or xylem and the bast or phloem stand side  by side on the same radius. In the larger of the two great groups into  which the Angiosperms are divided, the Dicotyledons, the bundles in  the very young stem are arranged in an open ring, separating a central  pith from an outer cortex. In each bundle, separating the xylem and  phloem, is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue, known as  cambium; by the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles  (interfascicular cambium) a complete ring is formed, and a regular  periodical increase in thickness results from it by the development  of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. The soft phloem soon  becomes crushed, but the hard wood persists, and forms the great bulk  of the stem and branches of the woody perennial. Owing to differences  in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end  of the season, the wood is marked out in transverse section into  concentric rings, one for each season of growth--the so-called annual  rings. In the smaller group, the Monocotyledons, the bundles are more  numerous in the young stem and scattered through the ground tissue.  Moreover they contain no cambium and the stem once formed increases in  diameter only in exceptional cases.      _Vegetative organs._    As in Gymnosperms, branching is monopodial; dichotomy or the forking  of the growing point into two equivalent branches which replace the  main stem, is absent both in the case of the stem and the root. The  leaves show a remarkable variety in form (see LEAF), but are generally  small in comparison with the size of the plant; exceptions occur in  some Monocotyledons, _e.g._ in the Aroid family, where in some genera  the plant produces one huge, much-branched leaf each season.    In rare cases the main axis is unbranched and ends in a flower,  as, for instance, in the tulip, where scale-leaves, forming the  underground bulb, green foliage-leaves and coloured floral leaves are  borne on one and the same axis. Generally, flowers are formed only  on shoots of a higher order, often only on the ultimate branches of  a much branched system. A potential branch or bud, either foliage or  flower, is formed in the axil of each leaf; sometimes more than one  bud arises, as for instance in the walnut, where two or three stand in  vertical series above each leaf. Many of the buds remain dormant, or  are called to development under exceptional circumstances, such as  the destruction of existing branches. For instance, the clipping of  a hedge or the lopping of a tree will cause to develop numerous buds  which may have been dormant for years. Leaf-buds occasionally arise  from the roots, when they are called adventitious; this occurs in many  fruit trees, poplars, elms and others. For instance, the young shoots  seen springing from the ground around an elm are not seedlings but  root-shoots. Frequently, as in many Dicotyledons, the primary root,  the original root of the seedling, persists throughout the life of  the plant, forming, as often in biennials, a thickened tap-root, as  in carrot, or in perennials, a much-branched root system. In many  Dicotyledons and most Monocotyledons, the primary root soon perishes,  and its place is taken by adventitious roots developed from the stem.      _Flower._    The most characteristic feature of the Angiosperm is the flower, which  shows remarkable variety in form and elaboration, and supplies the  most trustworthy characters for the distinction of the series and  families or natural orders, into which the group is divided. The  flower is a shoot (stem bearing leaves) which has a special form  associated with the special function of ensuring the fertilization of  the egg and the development of fruit containing seed. Except where  it is terminal it arises, like the leaf-shoot, in the axil of a leaf,  which is then known as a bract. Occasionally, as in violet, a flower  arises singly in the axil of an ordinary foliage-leaf; it is then  termed axillary. Generally, however, the flower-bearing portion of  the plant is sharply distinguished from the foliage leaf-bearing or  vegetative portion, and forms a more or less elaborate branch-system  in which the bracts are small and scale-like. Such a branch-system is  called an inflorescence. The primary function of the flower is to bear  the spores. These, as in Gymnosperms, are of two kinds, microspores  or pollen-grains, borne in the stamens (or microsporophylls) and  megaspores, in which the egg-cell is developed, contained in the  ovule, which is borne enclosed in the carpel (or megasporophyll). The  flower may consist only of spore-bearing leaves, as in willow, where  each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels. Usually,  however, other leaves are present which are only indirectly concerned  with the reproductive process, acting as protective organs for the  sporophylls or forming an attractive envelope. These form the perianth  and are in one series, when the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#9)"],[1,"nothin' nohow.\" After Ida's eyes had  rested on the yellow crepe frock just presented Georgia in appreciation  of the three hours she had given for the first interview, she became  reconciled for the story to be resumed, and even offered her assistance  in rousing the recollections of her parent.    \"Did I tell you\" Georgia began, \"dat de man what looked atter Marse  Alec's business was his fust cousin? He was de Marse Lordnorth I'se all  time talkin' 'bout, and Marse John was Marse Lordnorth's brother. Dere  warn't no cook or house gal up at de big house but Ma 'til atter she  died, and den when Miss Mary Berry tuk charge of de house dey made  Uncle Harry and his wife, Aunt 'Liza, house boy and cook.    \"Marse Alec growed all his corn on his Googer Crick plantation. He  planned for evvything us needed and dere warn't but mighty little dat he  didn't have raised to take keer of our needs. Lordy, didn't I tell you  what sort of shoes, holestock shoes is? Dem was de shoes de 'omans wore  and dey had extra pieces on de sides so us wouldn't knock holes in 'em  too quick.    \"De fust time I ever seed Marse Alec to know who he was, I warn't more'n  6 years old. Uncle Stafford had went fishin' and cotched de nicest mess  of fish you ever seed. He cleant 'em and put 'em in a pan of water, and  told me to take 'em up to de big house to Marse Alec. I was skeered when  I went in de big house yard and axed, what looked lak a little boy, whar  Marse Alec was, and I was wuss skeered when he said: 'Dis is Marse Alec  you is talkin' to. What you want?' I tole him Uncle Stafford sont him de  fishes and he told me: 'Take 'em to de kitchen and tell 'Liza to cook  'em for me.' I sho ain't never gwine to forgit dat.    \"One day dey sont me wid a bucket of water to de field, and I had to go  through de peach orchard. I et so many peaches, I was 'most daid when I  got back to de house. Dey had to drench me down wid sweet milk, and from  dat day to dis I ain't never laked peaches. From den on Marse Alec  called me de 'peach gal.'    \"Marse Alec warn't home much of de time, but when he was dar he used to  walk down to de cabins and laugh and talk to his Niggers. He used to  sing a song for de slave chillun dat run somepin lak dis:      'Walk light ladies     De cake's all dough,     You needn't mind de weather,     If de wind don't blow.'\"    Georgia giggled when she came to the end of the stanza. \"Us didn't know  when he was a-singin' dat tune to us chillun dat when us growed up us  would be cake walkin' to de same song.    \"On Sundays, whenever Marse Alec was home, he done lots of readin' out  of a great big old book. I didn't know what it was, but he was pow'ful  busy wid it. He never had no parties or dancin' dat I knows 'bout, but  he was all time havin' dem big 'portant mens at his house talkin' 'bout  de business what tuk him off from home so much. I used to see Lawyer  Coombs dere heaps of times. He was a big, fine lookin' man. Another big  lawyer was all time comin' dar too, but I done lost his name. Marse Alec  had so awful much sense in his haid dat folkses said it stunted his  growin'. Anyhow, long as he lived he warn't no bigger dan a boy.    \"When Uncle Harry's and Aunt 'Liza's daughter what was named 'Liza, got  married he was in Washin'ton or some place lak dat. He writ word to  Marse Linton, his half-brother, to pervide a weddin' for her. I knows  'bout dat 'cause I et some of dat barbecue. Dat's all I 'members 'bout  her weddin'. I done forgot de name of de bridegroom. He lived on some  other plantation. Aunt 'Liza had two gals and one boy. He was named  Allen.    \"Whilst Marse Alec was President or somepin, he got sick and had to come  back home, and it wern't long atter dat 'fore de surrender. Allen was  'pinted to watch for de blue coats. When dey come to take Marse Alec  off, dey was all over the place wid deir guns.

Some time  thereafter, this couple married on Mr. Marshal's plantation, and their  second child, born about 1850, was Alice Battle. From her birth until  freedom, Alice was a chattel of this Mr. Marshal, whom she refers to as  a humane man, though inclined to use the whip when occasion demanded.    Followed to its conclusion, Alice's life history is void of thrills and  simply an average ex-slave's story. As a slave, she was well fed, well  clothed, and well treated, as were her brother and sister slaves. Her  mother was a weaver, her father--a field hand, and she did both  housework and plantation labor.    Alice saw the Yankee pass her ex-master's home with their famous  prisoner, Jeff Davis, after his capture, in '65. The Yankee band, says  she, was playing \"We'll hang Jeff Davis on a Sour Apple Tree\". Some of  the soldiers \"took time out\" to rob the Marshal smokehouse. The Whites  and Negroes were all badly frightened, but the \"damyankees didn't harm  nobody\".    After freedom, Alice remained with the Marshals until Christmas, when  she moved away. Later, she and her family moved back to the Marshal  plantation for a few years. A few years still later, Alice married a  Battle \"Nigger\".    Since the early '70's, Alice has \"drifted around\" quite a bit. She and  her husband are now too old and feeble to work. They live with one of  their sons, and are objects of charity.          PLANTATION LIFE    JASPER BATTLE, Age 80  112 Berry St.,  Athens, Ga.    Written by:  Grace McCune [HW: (White)]  Athens    Edited by:  Sarah H. Hall  Athens    Leila Harris  Augusta    and  John N. Booth  District Supervisor  Federal Writers' Project  Residencies 6 & 7      The shade of the large water oaks in Jasper's yard was a welcome sight  when the interviewer completed the long walk to the old Negro's place in  the sweltering heat of a sunny July afternoon. The old house appeared to  be in good condition and the yard was clean and tidy. Jasper's wife,  Lula, came around the side of the house in answer to the call for  Jasper. A large checked apron almost covered her blue dress and a clean  white headcloth concealed her hair. Despite her advanced age, she seemed  to be quite spry.    \"Jus' come back here whar I'se a-doin' de white folks' washin',\" she  said. \"Jasper's done been powerful sick and I can't leave him by hisself  none. I brung him out here in de shade so I could watch him and 'tend to  him whilst I wuks. Jasper stepped on a old plank what had two rusty  nails in it, and both of 'em went up in his foot a fur ways. I done driv  dem nails plumb up to dey haids in de north side of a tree and put  jimpson weed poultices on Jasper's foot, but it's still powerful bad  off.\"    By this time we had arrived within sight and earshot of the old rocking  chair where Jasper sat with his foot propped high in another chair. His  chair had long ago been deprived of its rockers. The injured member  appeared to be swollen and was covered with several layers of the  jimpson weed leaves. The old man's thin form was clothed in a faded blue  shirt and old gray cotton trousers. His clothes were clean and his  white hair was in marked contrast to his shining but wrinkled black  face. He smiled when Lula explained the nature of the proposed  interview. \"'Scuse me, Missy,\" he apologized, \"for not gittin' up,  'cause I jus' can't use dis old foot much, but you jus' have a seat here  in de shade and rest yourself.\" Lula now excused herself, saying: \"I  jus' got to hurry and git de white folks' clothes washed and dried 'fore  it rains,\" and she resumed her work in the shade of another huge tree  where a fire was burning brightly under her washpot and a row of  sud-filled tubs occupied a long bench.    \"Lula, she has to wuk all de time,\" Jasper explained, \"and she don't  never have time to listen to me talk. I'se powerful glad somebody is  willin' to stop long enough to pay some heed whilst I talks 'bout  somepin. Dem days 'fore de war was good old days, 'specially for de  colored folks. I know, 'cause my Mammy done told me so. You see I was  mighty little and young when de war was over, but I heared de old folks  do lots of talkin' 'bout dem times whilst I was a-growin' up, and den  too, I stayed right dar on dat same place 'til I was 'bout grown.
