The wail of the fleeing  fugitive from the house of bondage sounded no longer far away and unreal  in his ears, but thrilled now right under the windows of his soul. The  masonic excitement and the commotion created by the abduction of Morgan  he caught up and shook before the eyes of his countrymen as an object  lesson of the million-times greater wrong daily done the slaves. \"All  this fearful commotion,\" he pealed, \"has arisen from the abduction of  _one man_. More than two millions of unhappy beings are groaning out  their lives in bondage, and scarcely a pulse quickens, or a heart leaps,  or a tongue pleads in their behalf. 'Tis a trifling affair, which  concerns nobody. Oh! for the spirit that rages, to break every fetter of  oppression!\" Such a spirit was fast taking possession of the writer.    Of this Lundy was well informed. He had not lost sight of his young  coadjutor, but had watched his course with great hope and growing  confidence. In him he found what he had discovered in no one else,  anti-slavery activity and perseverance. He had often found men who  protested loudly their benevolence for the negro, but who made not the  slightest exertion afterward to carry out their good wishes. \"They will  pen a paragraph, perhaps an article, or so--and then--_the subject is  exhausted!_\" It was not so with his young friend, the Bennington editor.  He saw that \"argument and useful exertion on the subject of African  emancipation can never be exhausted until the system of slavery itself  be totally annihilated.\" He was faithful among the faithless found by  Lundy. To reassure his doubting leader, Garrison took upon himself  publicly a vow of perpetual consecration to the slave. \"Before God and  our country,\" he declares, \"we give our pledge that the liberation of  the enslaved Africans shall always be uppermost in our pursuits. The  people of New England are interested in this matter, and they must be  aroused from their lethargy as by a trumpet-call. They shall not quietly  slumber while we have the management of a press, or strength to hold a  pen.\" The question of slavery had at length obtained the ascendency over  all other questions in his regard. And when Lundy perceived this he set  out from Baltimore to Bennington to invite Garrison to join hands with  him in his emancipation movement at Baltimore. He performed the long  journey on foot, with staff in hand in true apostolic fashion. The two  men of God met among the mountains of Vermont, and when the elder  returned from the heights the younger had resolved to follow him to the  vales where men needed his help, the utmost which he could give them. He  agreed to join his friend in Baltimore and there edit with him his  little paper with the grand name (_The Genius of Universal  Emancipation_), devoted to preaching the gospel of the gradual  abolishment of American slavery. Garrison was to take the position of  managing editor, and Lundy to look after the subscription list. The  younger to be resident, the elder itinerant partner in the publication  of the paper. Garrison closed his relations with the _Journal of the  Times_, March 27, 1829, and delivered his valedictory to its readers.  This valedictory strikes with stern hammer-stroke the subject of his  thoughts. \"Hereafter,\" it reads, \"the editorial charge of this paper  will devolve on another person. I am invited to occupy a broader field,  and to engage in a higher enterprise; that field embraces the whole  country--that enterprise is in behalf of the slave population.\"    \"To my apprehension, the subject of slavery involves interests of  greater moment to our welfare as a republic, and demands a more prudent  and minute investigation than any other which has come before the  American people since the Revolutionary struggle--than all others which  now occupy their attention. No body of men on the face of the earth  deserve their charities, and prayers, and united assistance so much as  the slaves of this country; and yet they are almost entirely neglected.  It is true many a cheek burns with shame in view of our national  inconsistency, and many a heart bleeds for the miserable African. It is  true examples of disinterested benevolence and individual sacrifices are  numerous, particularly in the Southern States; but no systematic,  vigorous, and successful measures have been made to overthrow this  fabric of oppression. I trust in God that I may be the humble instrument  of breaking at least one chain, and restoring one captive to liberty; it  will amply repay a life of severe toil.\" The causes of temperance and  peace came in also for an earnest parting word, but they had clearly  declined to a place of secondary importance in the writer's regard. To  be more exact, they had not really declined, but the slavery question  had risen in his mind above both. They were great questions, but it was  _the_ question--had become _his_ cause.    Lundy, after his visit to Garrison at Bennington, started on a trip to  Hayti with twelve emancipated slaves, whom he had undertaken to colonize  there. Garrison awaited in Boston the return of his partner to  Baltimore. The former, meanwhile, was out of employment, and sorely in  need of money. Never had he been favored with a surplusage of the root  of all evil. He was deficient in the money-getting and money-saving  instinct. Such was plainly not his vocation, and so it happened that  wherever he turned, he and poverty walked arm in arm, and the  interrogatory, \"wherewithal shall I be fed and clothed on the morrow?\"  was never satisfactorily answered until the morrow arrived. This led him  at times into no little embarrassment and difficulty. But since he was  always willing to work at the case, and to send his \"pride on a  pilgrimage to Mecca,\" the embarrassment was not protracted, nor did the  difficulty prove insuperable.    The Congregational societies of Boston invited him in June to deliver  before them a Fourth of July address in the interest of the Colonization  Society. The exercises took place in Park Street Church. Ten days before  this event he was called upon to pay a bill of four dollars for failure  to appear at the May muster. Refusing to do so, he was thereupon  summoned to come into the Police Court on the glorious Fourth to show  cause why he ought not to pay the amercement. He was in a quandary. He  did not owe the money, but as he could not be in two places at the same  time, and, inasmuch as he wanted very much to deliver his address before  the Congregational Societies, and did not at all long to make the  acquaintance of his honor, the Police Court Judge, he determined to pay  the fine. But, alack and alas! he had \"not a farthing\" with which to  discharge him from his embarrassment. Fortunately, if he wanted money he  did not want friends. And one of these, Jacob Horton, of Newburyport,  who had married his \"old friend and playmate, Harriet Farnham,\" came to  his rescue with the requisite amount.    On the day and place appointed Garrison appeared before the  Congregational Societies with an address, to the like of which, it is  safe to say, they had never before listened. It was the Fourth of July,  but the orator was in no holiday humor. There was not, in a single  sentence of the oration the slightest endeavor to be playful with his  audience. It was rather an eruption of human suffering, and of the  humanity of one man to man. What the Boston clergy saw that afternoon,  in the pulpit of Park Street Church, was the vision of a soul on fire.  Garrison burned and blazed as the sun that July afternoon burned and  blazed in the city's streets. None without escaped the scorching rays of  the latter, none within was able to shun the fervid heat of the former.  Those of my readers who have watched the effects of the summer's sun on  a track of sandy land and have noted how, about midday, the heat seems  to rise in sparkling particles and exhalations out of the hot,  surcharged surface, can form some notion of the moral fervor and passion  of this Fourth of July address, delivered more than sixty years ago, in  Boston. Through all the pores of it, over all the length and breadth of  it, there went up bright, burning particles from the sunlit sympathy and  humanity of the young reformer.    In beginning, he animadverted, among other things, on the spread of  intemperance, of political corruption, on the profligacy of the press,  and, amid them all, the self-complacency and boastfulness of the  national spirit, as if it bore a charmed life.    \"But,\" he continued, \"there is another evil which, if we had to contend  against nothing else, should make us quake for the issue. It is a  gangrene preying upon our vitals--an earthquake rumbling under our  feet--a mine accumulating material for a national catastrophe. It should  make this a day of fasting and prayer, not of boisterous merriment and  idle pageantry--a day of great lamentation, not of congratulatory joy.  It should spike every cannon, and haul down every banner. Our garb  should be sack-cloth--our heads bowed in the dust--our supplications for  the pardon and assistance of Heaven.    \"Sirs, I am not come to tell you that slavery is a curse, debasing in  its effects, cruel in its operations, fatal in its continuance. The day  and the occasion require no such revelation. I do not claim the  discovery as my own, that 'all men are born equal,' and that among their  inalienable rights are 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'  Were I addressing any other than a free and Christian assembly, the  enforcement of this truth might be pertinent. Neither do I intend to  analyze the horrors of slavery for your inspection, nor to freeze your  blood with authentic recitals of savage cruelty.

No doubt a considerable proportion of these do not die  here but during or after migration to other countries, but others which  are bred in distant countries come here, and thus balance the account.  Again, as the average number of young produced is four or five times  that of the parents, we ought to have at least five times as many birds  in the country at the end of summer as at the beginning, and there is  certainly no such enormous disproportion as this. The fact is, that the  destruction commences, and is probably most severe, with nestling birds,  which are often killed by heavy rains or blown away by severe storms, or  left to die of hunger if either of the parents is killed; while they  offer a defenceless prey to jackdaws, jays, and magpies, and not a few  are ejected from their nests by their foster-brothers the cuckoos. As  soon as they are fledged and begin to leave the nest great numbers are  destroyed by buzzards, sparrow-hawks, and shrikes. Of those which  migrate in autumn a considerable proportion are probably lost at sea or  otherwise destroyed before they reach a place of safety; while those  which remain with us are greatly thinned by cold and starvation during  severe winters. Exactly the same thing goes on with every species of  wild animal and plant from the lowest to the highest. All breed at such  a rate, that in a few years the progeny of any one species would, if  allowed to increase unchecked, alone monopolise the land; but all alike  are kept within bounds by various destructive agencies, so that, though  the numbers of each may fluctuate, they can never permanently increase  except at the expense of some others, which must proportionately  decrease.      _Cases showing the Great Powers of Increase of Animals._    As the facts now stated are the very foundation of the theory we are  considering, and the enormous increase and perpetual destruction  continually going on require to be kept ever present in the mind, some  direct evidence of actual cases of increase must be adduced. That even  the larger animals, which breed comparatively slowly, increase  enormously when placed under favourable conditions in new countries, is  shown by the rapid spread of cattle and horses in America. Columbus, in  his second voyage, left a few black cattle at St. Domingo, and these ran  wild and increased so much that, twenty-seven years afterwards, herds of  from 4000 to 8000 head were not uncommon. Cattle were afterwards taken  from this island to Mexico and to other parts of America, and in 1587,  sixty-five years after the conquest of Mexico, the Spaniards exported  64,350 hides from that country and 35,444 from St. Domingo, an  indication of the vast numbers of these animals which must then have  existed there, since those captured and killed could have been only a  small portion of the whole. In the pampas of Buenos Ayres there were, at  the end of the last century, about twelve million cows and three million  horses, besides great numbers in all other parts of America where open  pastures offered suitable conditions. Asses, about fifty years after  their introduction, ran wild and multiplied so amazingly in Quito, that  the Spanish traveller Ulloa describes them as being a nuisance. They  grazed together in great herds, defending themselves with their mouths,  and if a horse strayed among them they all fell upon him and did not  cease biting and kicking till they left him dead. Hogs were turned out  in St. Domingo by Columbus in 1493, and the Spaniards took them to other  places where they settled, the result being, that in about half a  century these animals were found in great numbers over a large part of  America, from 25 deg. north to 40 deg. south latitude. More recently, in New  Zealand, pigs have multiplied so greatly in a wild state as to be a  serious nuisance and injury to agriculture. To give some idea of their  numbers, it is stated that in the province of Nelson there were killed  in twenty months 25,000 wild pigs.[10] Now, in the case of all these  animals, we know that in their native countries, and even in America at  the present time, they do not increase at all in numbers; therefore the  whole normal increase must be kept down, year by year, by natural or  artificial means of destruction.      _Rapid Increase and Wide Spread of Plants_.    In the case of plants, the power of increase is even greater and its  effects more distinctly visible. Hundreds of square miles of the plains  of La Plata are now covered with two or three species of European  thistle, often to the exclusion of almost every other plant; but in the  native countries of these thistles they occupy, except in cultivated or  waste ground, a very subordinate part in the vegetation. Some American  plants, like the cotton-weed (Asclepias cuiussayica), have now become  common weeds over a large portion of the tropics. White clover  (Trifolium repens) spreads over all the temperate regions of the world,  and in New Zealand is exterminating many native species, including even  the native flax (Phormium tenax), a large plant with iris-like leaves 5  or 6 feet high. Mr. W.L. Travers has paid much attention to the effects  of introduced plants in New Zealand, and notes the following species as  being especially remarkable. The common knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare)  grows most luxuriantly, single plants covering a space 4 or 5 feet in  diameter, and sending their roots 3 or 4 feet deep. A large sub-aquatic  dock (Rumex obtusifolius) abounds in every river-bed, even far up among  the mountains. The common sow-thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) grows all over  the country up to an elevation of 6000 feet. The water-cress (Nasturtium  officinale) grows with amazing vigour in many of the rivers, forming  stems 12 feet long and 3/4 inch in diameter, and completely choking them  up. It cost L300 a year to keep the Avon at Christchurch free from it.  The sorrel (Rumex acetosella) covers hundreds of acres with a sheet of  red. It forms a dense mat, exterminating other plants, and preventing  cultivation. It can, however, be itself exterminated by sowing the  ground with red clover, which will also vanquish the Polygonum  aviculare. The most noxious weed in New Zealand appears, however, to be  the Hypochaeris radicata, a coarse yellow-flowered composite not  uncommon in our meadows and waste places. This has been introduced with  grass seeds from England, and is very destructive. It is stated that  excellent pasture was in three years destroyed by this weed, which  absolutely displaced every other plant on the ground. It grows in every  kind of soil, and is said even to drive out the white clover, which is  usually so powerful in taking possession of the soil.    In Australia another composite plant, called there the Cape-weed  (Cryptostemma calendulaceum), did much damage, and was noticed by Baron  Von Hugel in 1833 as \"an unexterminable weed\"; but, after forty years'  occupation, it was found to give way to the dense herbage formed by  lucerne and choice grasses.    In Ceylon we are told by Mr. Thwaites, in his _Enumeration of Ceylon  Plants_, that a plant introduced into the island less than fifty years  ago is helping to alter the character of the vegetation up to an  elevation of 3000 feet. This is the Lantana mixta, a verbenaceous plant  introduced from the West Indies, which appears to have found in Ceylon  a soil and climate exactly suited to it. It now covers thousands of  acres with its dense masses of foliage, taking complete possession of  land where cultivation has been neglected or abandoned, preventing the  growth of any other plants, and even destroying small trees, the tops of  which its subscandent stems are able to reach. The fruit of this plant  is so acceptable to frugivorous birds of all kinds that, through their  instrumentality, it is spreading rapidly, to the complete exclusion of  the indigenous vegetation where it becomes established.      _Great Fertility not essential to Rapid Increase_.    The not uncommon circumstance of slow-breeding animals being very  numerous, shows that it is usually the amount of destruction which an  animal or plant is exposed to, not its rapid multiplication, that  determines its numbers in any country. The passenger-pigeon (Ectopistes  migratorius) is, or rather was, excessively abundant in a certain area  in North America, and its enormous migrating flocks darkening the sky  for hours have often been described; yet this bird lays only two eggs.  The fulmar petrel exists in myriads at St. Kilda and other haunts of the  species, yet it lays only one egg. On the other hand the great shrike,  the tree-creeper, the nut-hatch, the nut-cracker, the hoopoe, and many  other birds, lay from four to six or seven eggs, and yet are never  abundant. So in plants, the abundance of a species bears little or no  relation to its seed-producing power. Some of the grasses and sedges,  the wild hyacinth, and many buttercups occur in immense profusion over  extensive areas, although each plant produces comparatively few seeds;  while several species of bell-flowers, gentians, pinks, and mulleins,  and even some of the composite, which produce an abundance of minute  seeds, many of which are easily scattered by the wind, are yet rare  species that never spread beyond a very limited area.    The above-mentioned passenger-pigeon affords such an excellent example  of an enormous bird-population kept up by a comparatively slow rate of  increase, and in spite of its complete helplessness and the great  destruction which it suffers from its numerous enemies, that the  following account of one of its breeding-places and migrations by the  celebrated American naturalist, Alexander Wilson, will be read with  interest:--    \"Not far from Shelbyville, in the State of"]]]
