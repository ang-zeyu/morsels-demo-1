They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at  the time of the catastrophe. We must mention, however, a note-book and  a watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a  weapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they  had thrown out everything to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes  of Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked  on Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in  such absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their  stranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some  things were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the  first necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever, not a  utensil. From nothing they must supply themselves with everything.    And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could  have brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their  situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must  hope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The castaways could expect  nothing but from themselves and from that Providence which never  abandons those whose faith is sincere.    But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast,  without trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was  inhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?    It was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest  possible delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take.  However, according to Pencroft's advice, it appeared best to wait a few  days before commencing an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some  provisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs.  The explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all  recruit their strength.    The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was  lighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of  shell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy  to kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the  summit of the plateau, either with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees  of the neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly,  the sweet water was there.    It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the  Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along  the shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb  particularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he  was in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the  catastrophe. He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus  Harding. No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended  in this vulgar fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a  few hundred feet from a shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the  body of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes,  touched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe  in his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his  determined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be  respected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him,  he hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was  like the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried,  and his grief was such that most probably he would not survive him.    This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on  the shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot  where the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding.    That day's breakfast was composed solely of pigeon's eggs and  lithodomes. Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the  hollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.    The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany  Herbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to  hunt. But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should  remain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable  event of Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly remained behind.    \"To the chase, Herbert,\" said the sailor. \"We shall find ammunition  on our way, and cut our weapons in the forest.\" But at the moment of  starting, Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would  perhaps be prudent to replace it by another substance.    \"What?\" asked Pencroft.    \"Burnt linen,\" replied the boy. \"That could in case of need serve for  tinder.\"    The sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the  inconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.  Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of  Pencroft's large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of  a half-burnt rag. This inflammable material was placed in the central  chamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all  wind and damp.    It was nine o'clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the  breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of  the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at  that place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of  the river.    Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout  branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert  rubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!    The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank.  From the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river  narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over  which the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose  themselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would  always lead them back to the point from which they started. But the bank  was not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees  bent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had  to break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the  broken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the  underwood. But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to  wander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition  and nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground,  which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior. It  looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached  the river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the  underwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore  appeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied  the bottom was more clearly visible. The hill, covered with trees  disposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank walking  would have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the  trees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of  their roots.    It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already  surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw  traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not  recognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert's  opinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless  would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of  an axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a  human foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on  any land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps  more to be feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little,  for the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and  after walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile.  As yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang  and fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had  inspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described,  in a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely  resembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a  metallic brilliancy.    \"That must be a jacamar,\" said Herbert, trying to get nearer.    \"This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,\" replied the sailor,  \"if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!\"    Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on  the wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and  disappeared in an instant.    \"How clumsy I am!\" cried Herbert.    \"No, no, my boy!\" replied the sailor. \"The blow was well aimed; many a  one would have missed it altogether! Come, don't be vexed with yourself.  We shall catch it another day!\"    As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many  being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in  vain for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many  ways in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth  parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in  the Southern Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae,  such as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine,  similar to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and  splendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.    At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage,  with long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches  strewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down.

The young man has a great heart, and he will understand.\"    So Chayah, blushing prettily, lent Bear Naphtali's delicate _Talith_,  and Beauty and the Beast made a rare couple under the wedding canopy.  Chayah wore the gold medallion and the three rows of pearls which her  lover had sent her the day before. And when the Rabbi had finished  blessing husband and wife, Naphtali spake the bridegroom privily, and  said:    \"Pass me my _Talith_ back.\"    But Bear answered: \"Nay, nay; the _Talith_ is in my keeping, and there  it shall remain.\"    \"But it is my _Talith_,\" protested Naphtali in an angry whisper. \"I only  lent it to Chayah to lend it thee.\"    \"It concerns me not.\" Bear returned in a decisive whisper. \"The _Talith_  is my due and I shall keep it. What! Have I not lost enough by marrying  thy sister? Did not thy father, peace be upon him, promise me two  hundred gulden with her?\"    Naphtali retired discomfited. But he made up his mind not to go without  some compensation. He resolved that during the progress of the wedding  procession conducting the bridegroom to the chamber of the bride, he  would be the man to snatch off Bear's new hat. Let the rest of the  riotous escort essay to snatch whatever other article of the  bridegroom's attire they would, the hat was the easiest to dislodge, and  he, Naphtali, would straightway reimburse himself partially with that.  But the instant the procession formed itself, behold the shifty  bridegroom forthwith removed his hat, and held it tightly under his arm.    A storm of protestations burst forth at his daring departure from  hymeneal tradition.    \"Nay, nay, put it on,\" arose from every mouth.    But Bear closed his and marched mutely on.    \"Heathen,\" cried the Rabbi. \"Put on your hat.\"    The attempt to enforce the religious sanction failed too. Bear had spent  several gulden upon his head-gear, and could not see the joke. He  plodded towards his blushing Chayah through a tempest of disapprobation.    Throughout life Bear Belcovitch retained the contrariety of character  that marked his matrimonial beginnings. He hated to part with money; he  put off paying bills to the last moment, and he would even beseech his  \"hands\" to wait a day or two longer for their wages. He liked to feel  that he had all that money in his possession. Yet \"at home,\" in Poland,  he had always lent money to the officers and gentry, when they ran  temporarily short at cards. They would knock him up in the middle of the  night to obtain the means of going on with the game. And in England he  never refused to become surety for a loan when any of his poor friends  begged the favor of him. These loans ran from three to five pounds, but  whatever the amount, they were very rarely paid. The loan offices came  down upon him for the money. He paid it without a murmur, shaking his  head compassionately over the poor ne'er do wells, and perhaps not  without a compensating consciousness of superior practicality.    Only, if the borrower had neglected to treat him to a glass of rum to  clench his signing as surety, the shake of Bear's head would become more  reproachful than sympathetic, and he would mutter bitterly: \"Five pounds  and not even a drink for the money.\" The jewelry he generously lavished  on his womankind was in essence a mere channel of investment for his  savings, avoiding the risks of a banking-account and aggregating his  wealth in a portable shape, in obedience to an instinct generated by  centuries of insecurity. The interest on the sums thus invested was the  gratification of the other oriental instinct for gaudiness.          CHAPTER III.    MALKA.      The Sunday Fair, so long associated with Petticoat Lane, is dying hard,  and is still vigorous; its glories were in full swing on the dull, gray  morning when Moses Ansell took his way through the Ghetto. It was near  eleven o'clock, and the throng was thickening momently. The vendors  cried their wares in stentorian tones, and the babble of the buyers was  like the confused roar of a stormy sea. The dead walls and hoardings  were placarded with bills from which the life of the inhabitants could  be constructed. Many were in Yiddish, the most hopelessly corrupt and  hybrid jargon ever evolved. Even when the language was English the  letters were Hebrew. Whitechapel, Public Meeting, Board School, Sermon,  Police, and other modern banalities, glared at the passer-by in the  sacred guise of the Tongue associated with miracles and prophecies,  palm-trees and cedars and seraphs, lions and shepherds and harpists.    Moses stopped to read these hybrid posters--he had nothing better to  do--as he slouched along. He did not care to remember that dinner was  due in two hours. He turned aimlessly into Wentworth Street, and studied  a placard that hung in a bootmaker's window. This was the announcement  it made in jargon:        Riveters, Clickers, Lasters, Finishers,        Wanted.        BARUCH EMANUEL,        Cobbler.        Makes and Repairs Boots.      Every Bit as Cheaply        as        MORDECAI SCHWARTZ,        of 12 Goulston Street.    Mordecai Schwartz was written in the biggest and blackest of Hebrew  letters, and quite dominated the little shop-window. Baruch Emanuel was  visibly conscious of his inferiority, to his powerful rival, though  Moses had never heard of Mordecai Schwartz before. He entered the shop  and said in Hebrew \"Peace be to you.\" Baruch Emanuel, hammering a sole,  answered in Hebrew:    \"Peace be to you.\"    Moses dropped into Yiddish.    \"I am looking for work. Peradventure have you something for me?\"    \"What can you do?\"    \"I have been a riveter.\"    \"I cannot engage any more riveters.\"    Moses looked disappointed.    \"I have also been a clicker,\" he said.    \"I have all the clickers I can afford,\" Baruch answered.    Moses's gloom deepened. \"Two years ago I worked as a finisher.\"    Baruch shook his head silently. He was annoyed at the man's persistence.  There was only the laster resource left.    \"And before that I was a laster for a week,\" Moses answered.    \"I don't want any!\" cried Baruch, losing his temper.    \"But in your window it stands that you do,\" protested Moses feebly.    \"I don't care what stands in my window,\" said Baruch hotly. \"Have you  not head enough to see that that is all bunkum? Unfortunately I work  single-handed, but it looks good and it isn't lies. Naturally I want  Riveters and Clickers and Lasters and Finishers. Then I could set up a  big establishment and gouge out Mordecai Schwartz's eyes. But the Most  High denies me assistants, and I am content to want.\"    Moses understood that attitude towards the nature of things. He went out  and wandered down another narrow dirty street in search of Mordecai  Schwartz, whose address Baruch Emanuel had so obligingly given him. He  thought of the _Maggid's_ sermon on the day before. The _Maggid_ had  explained a verse of Habakkuk in quite an original way which gave an  entirely new color to a passage in Deuteronomy. Moses experienced acute  pleasure in musing upon it, and went past Mordecai's shop without going  in, and was only awakened from his day-dream by the brazen clanging of a  bell It was the bell of the great Ghetto school, summoning its pupils  from the reeking courts and alleys, from the garrets and the cellars,  calling them to come and be Anglicized. And they came in a great  straggling procession recruited from every lane and by-way, big children  and little children, boys in blackening corduroy, and girls in  washed-out cotton; tidy children and ragged children; children in great  shapeless boots gaping at the toes; sickly children, and sturdy  children, and diseased children; bright-eyed children and hollow-eyed  children; quaint sallow foreign-looking children, and fresh-colored  English-looking children; with great pumpkin heads, with oval heads,  with pear-shaped heads; with old men's faces, with cherubs' faces, with  monkeys' faces; cold and famished children, and warm and well-fed  children; children conning their lessons and children romping  carelessly; the demure and the anaemic; the boisterous and the  blackguardly, the insolent, the idiotic, the vicious, the intelligent,  the exemplary, the dull--spawn of all countries--all hastening at the  inexorable clang of the big school-bell to be ground in the same great,  blind, inexorable Governmental machine. Here, too, was a miniature fair,  the path being lined by itinerant temptations. There was brisk traffic  in toffy, and gray peas and monkey-nuts, and the crowd was swollen by  anxious parents seeing tiny or truant offspring safe within the  school-gates. The women were bare-headed or be-shawled, with infants at  their breasts and little ones toddling at their sides, the men were  greasy, and musty, and squalid. Here a bright earnest little girl held  her vagrant big brother by the hand, not to let go till she had seen him  in the bosom of his class-mates. There a sullen wild-eyed mite in  petticoats was being dragged along, screaming, towards distasteful  durance. It was a drab picture--the bleak, leaden sky above, the sloppy,  miry stones below, the frowsy mothers and fathers, the motley children.    \"Monkey-nuts! Monkey-nuts!\" croaked a wizened old woman.    \"Oppea! Oppea!\" droned a doddering old Dutchman. He bore a great can of  hot peas in one hand and a lighthouse-looking pepper-pot in the other.  Some of the children swallowed the dainties hastily out of miniature  basins, others carried them within in paper packets for surreptitious  munching.    \"Call that a ay-puth?\" a small boy would say.    \"Not enough!\" the old man would exclaim in surprise. \"Here you are,  then!\" And he would give the peas another sprinkling from the  pepper-pot.    Moses Ansell's progeny were not in the picture. The younger children  were at home, the elder had gone to school"]]]
