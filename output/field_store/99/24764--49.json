[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#9)"],[1," Knights of the Round Table.\"  I got very little out of this,  but still the White Horse was a band of men who were unrestrained in their  desires and bore about the same relation to King Arthur's Knights that  Harding did to me.  However, the associations did not stop here but went on,  giving what at first seemed to be a meaningless list of words. \"W. H.\" first  called up the words, \"Wish Harding\"; next, \"Will Harding\"; next, \"With  Harding\"; and last, \"Walk Harding.\"  In a minute it flashed on me what this  all meant.  \"I WISH to do as Harding is doing, to WALK the way he is WITH  him and I WILL.\"  To walk up Queen Street meant, then, to follow his  example, as he at one time paid some attention to this Miss Agnes Queen.  Perhaps the reason why her name was selected instead of some others was  because his relations to her had been very slight and formal, and thus the  idea was easier for the censor to let into sleeping consciousness than it  would have been if some other names had been taken. \"W. H.,\" then,  symbolized the four expressions that arose in the analysis.    The meaning of \"King Street\" came last of anything in the dream, but I will  give it now.  I did not seem to be able to get anywhere on this for some  time, and the idea kept presenting itself that it symbolized that I was king  of the situation which seemed innocent enough; but at last there came an  association with Nero as portrayed in \"Quo Vadis.\"  I then remembered how I  read this book while in the adolescent stage, and how a cousin made remarks,  very sensuous in their nature, about parts of it.  I then got a vision of  the book, \"Mad Majesties,\" which I saw on the library table not long since.  Next came a memory of the French kings as portrayed in the works of Dumas.  At this point, I realized that the idea suggested by the word king is very  often, though not always, an idea or image of a very loose person as far as  his social life is concerned. Thus to walk Queen Street or follow the  example of Harding finds a parallel in walking King Street or following the  example of a king.    With the light in the window, I came into an entirely new field of  associations.  I cannot go far into detail here as it would involve others  as well as myself, but suffice to say that the light in the window called up  a paper on the subject of light which was written by a Mr. X. and read in my  hearing.  Now Mr. X. and I had both kept company with the same young lady at  different times, and here was another group of emotionally colored  experiences. However, the important function performed by the light was that  it symbolized (together with the house in which it was) the comforts, warmth  and pleasures of the very opposite condition from that of being \"out in the  cold world with no one to love.\"    The house number \"23\" is associated with at least two occasions. One Sunday  evening; a few of the boys of our \"squad,\" myself among them, went out with  the daughter of our landlady, and one or two other young ladies and took a  boat ride in the park. It was a beautiful summer night and the park was full  of young people who were treating each other to very endearing caresses.  There were so many who wanted boats that only one boat was unoccupied, and  it was No. 23.  It had been left because it was a hoodoo number, and the  other boaters were all superstitious. As we were not, we took this boat and  used it.  My longing lonesomeness was about at its maximum height on this  night. The other occasion associated with this number is that I became  engaged when I was twenty-three years old and at that time desired greatly  to be married; but, as I was in school, it had to be postponed.    Now the climax of the dream!  I took a key from my pocket, unlocked the door  and entered.  This is so plain that it hardly needs comment. Being in the  cold world, as symbolized by the cold street, I enter the warmth and comfort  of the lighted house.  The key and lock are, of course, phallic symbols and  have special significance for me as I once took a young lady to a banquet at  which the favors were paper keys and hearts. Thus symbolically are fulfilled  all the longings I felt while with Harding, all my desires to be married  when twenty-three, all my adolescent courtship yearnings, and all my  remaining repressed sexual longings.    As a point which may have a little bearing on this, I have recently received  a letter from Harding and in it was information that he is for a time away  from home, and I wondered if he is still careless in his behavior.    This analysis will seem foolish in the extreme to many, and I am one of the  number, but my excuse is that I have copied as closely after the Freudians  as possible.  I have only to invite a comparison. This is not a \"made up\"  dream, but a little bit out of my daily life; just an experience occurring  on the way home from the seminary. The analysis is real in the sense that  the associations arose as I have recorded them.    Perhaps some ardent Freudian might find it in his heart to say that this  analysis only strengthened their position, as it showed how a whole sexual  background underlies our entire life, and therefore our dreams must have a  sexual origin. But the reason why I found a sexual solution of this was that  I started the analysis with a definite Bewnssteinlage, as Titchener would  call it, which consisted of a knowledge that I had started for a certain  kind of solution, and the whole course of the associations was governed by  this.  If Freud had at first come into the possession of a theory that every  dream fulfills a fear, or pictures a state of anger or any other emotion, he  would have had just as good success in demonstrating the truth of his  statements.  The following analysis will illustrate this. This is a real  dream, but before beginning the analysis, I took the attitude that the  analysis would reveal the fulfillment of a fear or show that the dream was  the dramatic representation of a feared condition as actually existing. It  took some time to get into this attitude, it is true, but when the result  was finally accomplished, the analysis was begun and the attempt was made to  follow the Freudian method as closely as possible under the changed  conditions.    The Dream.  On the night of February first, I dreamed that I was going down  a little hill in company with my brother and Mr. N. We seemed to be in  Colorado, and at the foot of the hill was a little stream which was very  pretty. There was a little waterfall, and a green pool below it, and a mist  hung over the pool.  I am not sure I saw the color of this pool. There was  also a huge rock around which the water dashed. Some people were fishing in  the stream.  Some one asked if we could see the rainbows, and Mr. N. replied  that he could see only one. I then looked carefully and saw a purple haze in  the mist over the pool and supposed this was what was meant.  But, as I  continued to look, I saw a great number of rainbows, or at least patches in  the mist over the water which showed the spectral colors. These were about  two feet in diameter and extraordinarily beautiful. I was very anxious to  get some of the trout which I felt sure were In the stream.  As we came  nearer, it seemed that the stream had overflowed and there were several  shallow pools not over a foot deep and eight or ten feet long. In these  pools could be seen fish by the dozen from a foot to eight feet long.  I was  slightly troubled because it would muddy my shoes, but I began to try to get  some of them out. I got one very big one by the gill slit, but could not  manage him and had to let him go.  I handled several in the dream, but do  not know whether or not I got any out.        ANALYSIS OF DREAM SHOWING FULFILLMENT OF A FEAR    I had some trouble in getting any light on this dream, but suddenly much of  the meaning became clear and a whole group of associations came up.  Undoubtedly the trouble I experienced at first was caused by the resistance  of the censor. I will give the associated memories first and explain them  later.    I delight in fishing and have spent many happy hours fishing for trout In  the clear waters of the Colorado streams; but, strange as it may seem, it  was not a memory of any of these which come into consciousness. Instead,  there came up memories of three different instances, each accompanied with  definite visual imagery, and in such rapid succession that I could hardly  tell which came first.    Six years ago last summer, I crossed the Ohio River to spend a day in  Carrolton, Kentucky, and on the way back, I bought some fish of a fisherman  at the river's edge.  This man was barefooted and wore a little greasy wool  hat and very ragged clothes. I remember thinking at the time that his work  must be very degrading, and that the river fisherman must be about the  lowest type in that part of the country.  I especially noticed his feet and  legs, which were bare to the knees, and which were so sunburned that they  hardly looked like parts of a white man's body. In the analysis of this  dream, the image of the man as he stood there and the memory of the incident  came back with great vividness.    A year or two later, my brother and I were riding along the road at about  the same place, and we met a very miserable-looking specimen of humanity,  driving a poor limping horse to a rickety wagon in which were some pieces of  driftwood.  My brother was in a \"spell of the blues\" at this time, and he  remarked that he was coming to just that condition as fast as he could. The  image and memory of this incident also came into consciousness as if it had  been waiting repressed just under the surface.    The other memory was one in which I did not figure personally. A year or so  ago, my brother was telling me how he and his boy had gone to the river  several times and gone fishing with an old fisherman who lived there.

The rings thus  generated, are called _Gleineu Nadroeth_; in English, Snake-stones. They  are small glass amulets, commonly about half as wide as our  finger-rings, but much thicker, of a green colour usually, though  sometimes blue, and waved with red and white.\"    [41] Pliny, _Naturalis Historia_ xxiv. 12 and 68, xxv. 171.
