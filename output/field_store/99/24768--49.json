It is to overcome this tendency that floor joists are braced at  frequent intervals. Short deep pieces shear out or split before  their strength in bending can fully come into play.      _Application of Loads_    There are three[12] general methods in which loads may be  applied to beams, namely:    [Footnote 12: A fourth might be added, namely, ~vibratory~, or  ~harmonic repetition~, which is frequently serious in the case  of bridges.]    (1) ~Static loading~ or the gradual imposition of load so that  the moving parts acquire no appreciable momentum. Loads are so  applied in the ordinary testing machine.    (2) ~Sudden imposition of load without initial velocity.~ \"Thus  in the case of placing a load on a beam, if the load be brought  into contact with the beam, but its weight sustained by external  means, as by a cord, and then this external support be  _suddenly_ (instantaneously) removed, as by quickly cutting the  cord, then, although the load is already touching the beam (and  hence there is no real impact), yet the beam is at first  offering no resistance, as it has yet suffered no deformation.  Furthermore, as the beam deflects the resistance increases, but  does not come to be equal to the load until it has attained its  normal deflection. In the meantime there has been an unbalanced  force of gravity acting, of a constantly diminishing amount,  equal at first to the entire load, at the normal deflection. But  at this instant the load and the beam are in motion, the  hitherto unbalanced force having produced an accelerated  velocity, and this velocity of the weight and beam gives to them  an energy, or _vis viva_, which must now spend itself in  overcoming an _excess_ of resistance over and above the imposed  load, and the whole mass will not stop until the deflection (as  well as the resistance) has come to be equal to _twice_ that  corresponding to the static load imposed. Hence we say the  effect of a suddenly imposed load is to produce twice the  deflection and stress of the same load statically applied. It  must be evident, however, that this case has nothing in common  with either the ordinary 'static' tests of structural materials  in testing-machines, or with impact tests.\"[13]    [Footnote 13: Johnson, J.B.: The materials of construction, pp.  81-82.]    (3) ~Impact, shock,~ or ~blow.~[14] There are various common  uses of wood where the material is subjected to sudden shocks  and jars or impact. Such is the action on the felloes and spokes  of a wagon wheel passing over a rough road; on a hammer handle  when a blow is struck; on a maul when it strikes a wedge.    [Footnote 14: See Tiemann, Harry D.: The theory of impact and  its application to testing materials. Jour. Franklin Inst.,  Oct., Nov., 1909, pp. 235-259, 336-364.]    Resistance to impact is resistance to energy which is measured  by the product of the force into the space through which it  moves, or by the product of one-half the moving mass which  causes the shock into the square of its velocity. The work done  upon the piece at the instant the velocity is entirely removed  from the striking body is equal to the total energy of that  body. It is impossible, however, to get all of the energy of the  striking body stored in the specimen, though the greater the  mass and the shorter the space through which it moves, or, in  other words, the greater the proportion of weight and the  smaller the proportion of velocity making up the energy of the  striking body, the more energy the specimen will absorb. The  rest is lost in friction, vibrations, heat, and motion of the  anvil.    In impact the stresses produced become very complex and  difficult to measure, especially if the velocity is high, or the  mass of the beam itself is large compared to that of the weight.    The difficulties attending the measurement of the stresses  beyond the elastic limit are so great that commonly they are not  reckoned. Within the elastic limit the formulae for calculating  the stresses are based on the assumption that the deflection is  proportional to the stress in this case as in static tests.    A common method of making tests upon the resistance of wood to  shock is to support a small beam at the ends and drop a heavy  weight upon it in the middle. (See Fig. 40.) The height of the  weight is increased after each drop and records of the  deflection taken until failure. The total work done upon the  specimen is equal to the area of the stress-strain diagram plus  the effect of local inertia of the molecules at point of  contact.    The stresses involved in impact are complicated by the fact that  there are various ways in which the energy of the striking body  may be spent:    (_a_) It produces a local deformation of both bodies at the  surface of contact, within or beyond the elastic limit. In  testing wood the compression of the substance of the steel  striking-weight may be neglected, since the steel is very hard  in comparison with the wood. In addition to the compression of  the fibres at the surface of contact resistance is also offered  by the inertia of the particles there, the combined effect of  which is a stress at the surface of contact often entirely out  of proportion to the compression which would result from the  action of a static force of the same magnitude. It frequently  exceeds the crushing strength at the extreme surface of contact,  as in the case of the swaging action of a hammer on the head of  an iron spike, or of a locomotive wheel on the steel rail. This  is also the case when a bullet is shot through a board or a pane  of glass without breaking it as a whole.    (_b_) It may move the struck body as a whole with an accelerated  velocity, the resistance consisting of the inertia of the body.  This effect is seen when a croquet ball is struck with a mallet.    (_c_) It may deform a fixed body against its external supports  and resistances. In making impact tests in the laboratory the  test specimen is in reality in the nature of a cushion between  two impacting bodies, namely, the striking weight and the base  of the machine. It is important that the mass of this base be  sufficiently great that its relative velocity to that of the  common centre of gravity of itself and the striking weight may  be disregarded.    (_d_) It may deform the struck body as a whole against the  resisting stresses developed by its own inertia, as, for  example, when a baseball bat is broken by striking the ball.    |-------------------------------------------------------|  |                        TABLE X                        |  |-------------------------------------------------------|  | RESULTS OF IMPACT BENDING TESTS ON SMALL CLEAR BEAMS  |  |            OF 34 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION             |  |               (Forest Service Cir. 213)               |  |-------------------------------------------------------|  |                   |   Fibre   |            | Work in  |  |    COMMON NAME    | stress at | Modulus of | bending  |  |    OF SPECIES     |  elastic  | elasticity |    to    |  |                   |   limit   |            | elastic  |  |                   |           |            |  limit   |  |-------------------+-----------+------------+----------|  |                   |           |            | In.-lbs. |  |                   | Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  | per cu.  |  |                   | sq. in.   |  sq. in.   | inch     |  |                   |           |            |          |  |    Hardwoods      |           |            |          |  |                   |           |            |          |  | Ash, black        |    7,840  |    955,000 |    3.69  |  |   white           |   11,710  |  1,564,000 |    4.93  |  | Basswood          |    5,480  |    917,000 |    1.84  |  | Beech             |   11,760  |  1,501,000 |    5.10  |  | Birch, yellow     |   11,080  |  1,812,000 |    3.79  |  | Elm, rock         |   12,090  |  1,367,000 |    6.52  |  |   slippery        |   11,700  |  1,569,000 |    4.86  |  |   white           |    9,910  |  1,138,000 |    4.82  |  | Hackberry         |   10,420  |  1,398,000 |    4.48  |  | Locust, honey     |   13,460  |  2,114,000 |    4.76  |  | Maple, red        |   11,670  |  1,411,000 |    5.45  |  |   sugar           |   11,680  |  1,680,000 |    4.55  |  | Oak, post         |   11,260  |  1,596,000 |    4.41  |  |   red             |   10,580  |  1,506,000 |    4.16  |  |   swamp white     |   13,280  |  2,048,000 |    4.79  |  |   white           |    9,860  |  1,414,000 |    3.84  |  |   yellow          |   10,840  |  1,479,000 |    4.44  |  | Osage orange      |   15,520  |  1,498,000 |    8.92  |  | Sycamore          |    8,180  |  1,165,000 |    3.22  |  | Tupelo            |    7,650  |  1,310,000 |    2.49  |  |                   |           |            |          |  |    Conifers       |           |            |          |  |                   |           |            |          |  | Arborvitae         |    5,290  |    778,000 |    2.04  |  | Cypress, bald     |    8,290  |  1,431,000 |    2.71  |  | Fir, alpine       |    5,280  |    980,000 |    1.59  |  |   Douglas         |    8,870  |  1,579,000 |    2.79  |  |   white           |    7,230  |  1,326,000 |    2.21  |  | Hemlock           |    6,330  |  1,025,000 |    2.19  |  | Pine, lodgepole   |    6,870  |  1,142,000 |    2.31  |  |   longleaf        |    9,680  |  1,739,000 |    3.02  |  |   red             |    7,480  |  1,438,000 |    2.18  |  |   sugar           |    6,740  |  1,083,000 |    2.34  |  |   western yellow  |    7,070  |  1,115,000 |    2.51  |  |   white           |    6,490  |  1,156,000 |    2.06  |  | Spruce, Engelmann |    6,300  |  1,076,000 |    2.09  |  | Tamarack          |    7,750  |  1,263,000 |    2.67  |  |-------------------------------------------------------|    Impact testing is difficult to conduct"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12327"],[0,"The Jewish Manual (#9)"],[1," put it on in very little water, let it  simmer till tender, then cut it in pieces, without removing the bone,  and continue stewing for three hours, till they become perfectly soft;  if the liquor boils away, add a little more water, but there should  not be more liquor than can be served in the dish with the foot; the  only seasoning requisite is a little salt and white pepper, and a  sprig of parsley, or a pinch of saffron to improve the appearance; a  little delicately-made thin egg sauce, with a flavor of lemon juice,  may be served in a sauce-tureen if approved; sippets of toast or well  boiled rice to garnish the dish, may also be added, and will not be an  unacceptable addition.           *       *       *       *       *    TENDONS OF VEAL.    This is a very fine and nutritious dish; cut from the bones of a  breast of veal the tendons which are round the front, trim and blanch  them, put them with slices of smoked beef into a stewpan with some  shavings of veal, a few herbs, a little sliced lemon, two or three  onions, and a little broth; they must simmer for seven or eight hours;  when done, thicken the gravy and add white wine and mushrooms and  egg-balls; a few peas with the tendons will be found excellent, a  piece of mint and a little white sugar will then be requisite.           *       *       *       *       *    FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.    Take a piece from the shoulder, about three to four pounds, trim it  and form it into a well shaped even piece, the surface of which should  be quite smooth; _pique_ it thickly, put it into a stewpan with a  couple of onions, a carrot sliced, sweet herbs, two or three bay  leaves, a large piece of _chorissa_ or a slice of the root of a tongue  smoked, a little whole pepper and salt; cover it with a gravy made  from the trimmings of the veal, and stew till extremely tender, which  can be proved by probing it with a fine skewer, then reduce part of  the gravy to a glaze, glaze the meat with it and serve on a _puree_ of  vegetables.           *       *       *       *       *    COLLARED VEAL.    Remove the bones, gristle, &c., from a nice piece of veal, the breast  is the best part for the purpose; season the meat well with chopped  herbs, mace, pepper, and salt, then lay between the veal slices of  smoked tongue variegated with beetroot, chopped parsley, and hard  yolks of eggs, roll it up tightly in a cloth, simmer for some hours  till tender; when done, it should have a weight laid on it to press  out the liquor.           *       *       *       *       *    CURRIED VEAL.    Cut a breast of veal into pieces, fry lightly with a chopped onion,  then rub the veal over with currie powder, put it into a good gravy of  veal and beef, season simply with pepper, salt, and lemon juice.    Fowls curried are prepared in the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    CUTLETS.    Cut them into proper shape and beat them with a roller until the fibre  of the meat is entirely broken; if this is not done, they will be  hard; they must then be covered with egg and sprinkled with flour, or  a preparation for cutlets may be spread over them, and then fry them  of a fine brown, remove the cutlets to a hot dish, and add to the fat  in which the cutlets have been fried, a spoonful of flour, a small cup  of gravy, salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice or lemon pickle.           *       *       *       *       *    CUTLETS A LA FRANCAISE.    French cooks cut them thinner than the English, and trim them into  rounds of the size of a tea-cup; they must be brushed over with egg,  and sprinkled with salt, white pepper, mushroom powder, and grated  lemon peel; put them into a _saute_ pan and fry of a very light brown;  pieces of bread, smoked meat or tongue cut of the same size as the  cutlets, and prepared in the same manner, are laid alternately in the  dish with them; they should be served without sauce and with a _puree_  of mushrooms or spinach in the centre of the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    CUTLETS IN WHITE FRICASSEE.    Cut them in proper shapes, put them in a veal gravy made with the  trimmings enough to cover them; season delicately, and let them simmer  till quite tender, but not long enough to lose their shape; fresh  button mushrooms and a piece of lemon peel are essential to this dish;  when the meat is done remove it, take all fat from the gravy, and  thicken it with the yolks of two beaten eggs; small balls of forcemeat  in which mushrooms must be minced should be poached in the gravy when  about to be served; the meat must be returned to the saucepan to be  made hot, and when placed in the dish, garnish with thin slices of  lemon.           *       *       *       *       *    CUTLETS IN BROWN FRICASSEE.    They must be trimmed as above, fried slightly and stewed in beef  gravy, and seasoned according to the directions given for a brown  fricassee of veal; balls or fritters are always an improvement to the  appearance of this dish.           *       *       *       *       *    BLANQUETTE OF VEAL.    Cut into thin pieces of the size of shillings and half crowns, cold  veal or poultry, lay it in a small saucepan with a handful of fresh  well cleaned button mushrooms, pour over a little veal gravy, only  enough to cover them, with a piece of clarified veal fat about the  size of the yolk of a hard boiled egg; flavor with a piece of lemon  peel, very little white pepper and salt, one small lump of white  sugar, and a little nutmeg, stew all together for fifteen minutes,  then pour over a sauce prepared in a separate saucepan, made with veal  gravy, a little lemon juice, but not much, and the beaten yolks of two  eggs, let it simmer for an instant and then serve it up in the centre  of a dish prepared with a wall of mashed potatoes, delicately browned;  a few truffles renders this dish more elegant.           *       *       *       *       *    MINCED VEAL.    Cut in small square pieces about the size of dice, cold dressed veal,  put it into a saucepan with a little water or gravy, season simply  with salt, pepper, and grated or minced lemon peel, the mince should  be garnished with sippets of toast.           *       *       *       *       *    MIROTON OF VEAL.    Mince finely some cold veal or poultry, add a little grated tongue,  or smoked beef, a few crumbs of bread, sweet herbs, pepper, salt,  parsley, and if approved, essence of lemon, mix all well with two or  three eggs, and a very small quantity of good gravy; grease a mould,  put in the above ingredients and bake for three-quarters of an hour;  turn out with care, and serve with mushroom sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    FRICONDELLES.    Prepare cold veal or poultry as in the last receipt, add instead of  crumbs of bread, a French roll soaked in white gravy, mix with it  the same ingredients, and form it into two shapes to imitate small  chickens or sweetbreads; sprinkle with crumbs of bread, and place in a  frying-pan as deep as a shallow saucepan; when they have fried  enough to become set, pour enough weak gravy in the pan to cover the  fricondelles, and let them stew in it gently, place them both in  the same dish, and pour over any well thickened sauce that may be  selected.           *       *       *       *       *    ANOTHER SORT.    Prepare four small pieces of veal to serve in one dish, according to  the directions given for fricandeau of veal; these form a very pretty  _entree_; the pieces of veal should be about the size of pigeons.           *       *       *       *       *    SMOKED VEAL.    Take a fine fat thick breast of veal, bone it, lay it in pickle,  according to the receipt to salt meat, hang it for three or four weeks  in wood-smoke, and it will prove a very fine savoury relish, either  boiled and eaten cold, or fried as required.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEETBREADS ROASTED.    First soak them in warm water, and then blanch them; in whatever  manner they are to be dressed, this is essential; they may be prepared  in a variety of ways, the simplest is to roast them; for this they  have only to be covered with egg and bread crumbs, seasoned with salt  and pepper, and finished in a Dutch oven or cradle spit, frequently  basting with clarified veal suet; they may be served either dry with a  _puree_ of vegetables, or with a brown gravy.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEETBREADS STEWED WHITE.    After soaking and blanching, stew them in veal gravy, and season with  celery, pepper, salt, nutmeg, a little mace, and a piece of lemon  peel, they should be served with a fine white sauce, the gravy in  which they are stewed will form the basis for it, with the addition  of yolks of eggs and mushroom essence; French cooks would adopt the  _veloute_ or _bechamel_ sauce; Jerusalem artichokes cut the size of  button mushrooms, are a suitable accompaniment as a garnish.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEETBREADS STEWED BROWN.    After soaking and blanching, fry them till brown, then simmer gently  in beef gravy seasoned highly with smoked meat, nutmeg, pepper, salt,  a small onion stuck with cloves, and a very little whole allspice;  the gravy must be slightly thickened, and morels and truffles are  generally added; small balls of delicate forcemeat are also  an improvement. The above receipts are adapted for sweetbreads  fricasseed, except that they must be cut in pieces for fricassees, and  pieces of meat or poultry are added to them; sweetbreads when dressed  whole look better _piques_.           *       *       *       *       *    A DELICATE RECEIPT FOR ROAST MUTTON.    Put the joint in a saucepan, cover it with cold water, let it boil for  half an hour, have the spit and fire quite ready, and remove the meat  from the saucepan, and place it immediately down to roast, baste it  well, dredge it repeatedly with flour, and sprinkle with salt;  this mode of roasting mutton removes the"]]]
