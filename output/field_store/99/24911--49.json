The first was he to testify      Of that new life which man might win;    In Jordan's consecrating stream      He purged the stains of ancient sin,    And, as he made the body clean,      The radiant Spirit entered in.      Forth from the holy tide they came      Reborn, from guilt's pollution free,    As bright from out the cleansing fire      Flows the rough gold, or as we see    The glittering silver, purged of dross,      Flash into polished purity.      Now let us tell, from Holy Writ,      Of olden fasts the fairest crown;    How God in pity stayed His hand,      And spared a doomed and guilty town,    In clemency the flames withheld      And laid His vengeful lightnings down.      A mighty race of ancient time      Waxed arrogant in boastful pride;    Debauched were they, and borne along      On foul corruption's loathsome tide,    Till in their stiff-necked self-conceit      They e'en the God of Heaven denied.      At last Eternal Mercy turns      To righteous judgment, swift and dire;    He shakes the clouds; the mighty sword      Flames in His hand, and in His ire    He wields the roaring hurricane      'Mid murky gloom and flashing fire.      Yet in His clemency He grants      To penitence a brief delay,    That they might burst the bonds of lust      And put their vanities away;    His sentence given, He waits awhile      And stays the hand upraised to slay.      To warn them of the wrath to come      The Avenger in His mercy sent    Jonah the seer; but,--though he knew      The threatening Judge would fain relent    Nor wished to strike,--towards Tarshish town      The prophet's furtive course was bent.      As up the galley's side he climbed,      They loosed the dripping rope, and passed    The harbour bar: then on them burst      The sudden fury of the blast;    And when their peril's cause they sought,      The lot was on the recreant cast.      The man whose guilt the urn declares      Alone must die, the rest to save;    Hurled headlong from the deck, he falls      And sinks beneath the engulfing wave,    Then, seized by monstrous jaws, is plunged      Into a vast and living grave.           *       *       *       *       *      At last the monster hurls him forth,      As the third night had rolled away;    Before its roar the billows break      And lash the cliffs with briny spray;    Unhurt the wondering prophet stands      And hails the unexpected day.      Thus turned again to duty's path      To Nineveh he swiftly came,    Their lusts rebuked and boldly preached      God's judgment on their sin and shame;    \"Believe!\" he cried, \"the Judge draws nigh      Whose wrath shall wrap your streets in flame.\"      Thence to the lofty mount withdrew,      Where he might watch the smoke-cloud lower    O'er blasted homes and ruined halls,      And rest beneath the shady bower    Upspringing in swift luxury      Of twining tendril, leaf and flower.      But when the guilty burghers heard      The impending doom, a dull despair    Possessed their souls; proud senators,      Poor craftsmen, throng the highways fair;    Pale youth with tottering age unites,      And women's wailing rends the air.      A public fast they now decree,      If they may thus Christ's anger stay:    No food they touch: each haughty dame      Puts silken robes and gems away,    In sable garbed, and ashes casts      Upon her tresses' disarray.      In dark and squalid vesture clad      The Fathers go: the mourning crowd    Dons rough attire: in shaggy skins      Enwrapped, fair maids their faces shroud    With dusky veils, and boyish heads      E'en to the very dust are bowed.      The King tears off his jewelled brooch      And rends the robe of Coan hue;    Bright emeralds and lustrous pearls      Are flung aside, and ashes strew    The royal head, discrowned and bent,      As low he kneels God's grace to sue.      None thought to drink, none thought to eat;      All from the table turned aside,    And in their cradles wet with tears      Starved babes in bitter anguish cried,    For e'en the foster-mother stern      To little lips the breast denied.      The very flocks are closely penned      By careful hands, lest they should gain    Sweet water from the babbling stream      Or wandering crop the dewy plain;    And bleating sheep and lowing kine      Within their barren stalls complain.      Moved by such penitence, full soon      God's grace repealed the stern decree    And curbed His righteous wrath; for aye,      When man repents, His clemency    Is swift to pardon and to hear      His children weeping bitterly.      Yet wherefore of that bygone race      Should we anew the story tell?    For Christ's pure soul by fasting long      The clogging bonds of flesh did quell;    He Whom the prophet's voice foretold      As GOD WITH US, Emmanuel.      Man's body--frail by nature's law      And bound by pleasure's easy chain--    He freed by virtue's strong restraint,      And gave it liberty again:    He broke the bonds of flesh, and Lust      Was driven from his old domain.      Deep in the inhospitable wild      For forty days He dwelt alone    Nor tasted food, till, thus prepared,      All human weakness overthrown    By fasting's power, His mortal frame      Rejoiced the spirit's sway to own.      The Adversary, marvelling      To see this creature of a day    Endure such toil, spent all his guile      To learn if God in human clay    Had come indeed; but soon rebuked      Behind His back fled shamed away.      Therefore let each with all his might      Follow the way the Master taught,    The law of consecrated life      Which Christ unto His servants brought;    Till, with the lusts of flesh subdued,      The spirit reigns o'er act and thought.      'Tis this our jealous foe abhors,      'Tis this the Lord of earth and sky    Approves; by this the soul is made      Thy holy altar, God Most High:    Faith stirs within the slumbering heart      And sin's corroding power must fly.      Swifter than water quenches fire,      Swifter than sunshine melts the snow,    Crushed out by soul-restoring fast      Vanish the sins that rankly grow,    If hand in hand with Abstinence      Sweet Charity doth ever go.      This too is Virtue's noble task,      To clothe the naked, and to feed    The destitute, with kindly care      To visit sufferers in their need;    For king and beggar each must bear      The lot by changeless Fate decreed.      Happy the man whose good right hand      Seeks but God's praise, and flings his gold    Broadcast, nor lets his left hand know      The gracious deed; for wealth untold    Shall crown him through eternal years      With usury an hundredfold.

HYMN AFTER FASTING       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#9)"],[1,"same Jahrbuch, Bd.  I, 1899 (\"Die objektive Diagnose der Homosexualitat,\" by M. Hirschfeld,  pp. 8-9). In the determination of sex, as far as heterosexual persons  are concerned, some are disproportionately more strongly developed than  others. G. Herman is firm in his belief \"that in every woman there are  male, and in every man there are female germs and qualities\" (Genesis,  das Gesetz der Zeugung, 9 Bd., Libido und Manie, 1903). As recently as  1906 W. Fliess (Der Ablauf des Lebens) has claimed ownership of the idea  of bisexuality (in the sense of double sex). Psychoanalytic  investigation very strongly opposes the attempt to separate homosexuals  from other persons as a group of a special nature. By also studying  sexual excitations other than the manifestly open ones it discovers that  all men are capable of homosexual object selection and actually  accomplish this in the unconscious. Indeed the attachments of libidinous  feelings to persons of the same sex play no small role as factors in  normal psychic life, and as causative factors of disease they play a  greater role than those belonging to the opposite sex. According to  psychoanalysis, it rather seems that it is the independence of the  object, selection of the sex of the object, the same free disposal over  male and female objects, as observed in childhood, in primitive states  and in prehistoric times, which forms the origin from which the normal  as well as the inversion types developed, following restrictions in this  or that direction. In the psychoanalytic sense the exclusive sexual  interest of the man for the woman is also a problem requiring an  explanation, and is not something that is self-evident and explainable  on the basis of chemical attraction. The determination as to the  definite sexual behavior does not occur until after puberty and is the  result of a series of as yet not observable factors, some of which are  of a constitutional, while some are of an accidental nature. Certainly  some of these factors can turn out to be so enormous that by their  character they influence the result. In general, however, the  multiplicity of the determining factors is reflected by the manifoldness  of the outcomes in the manifest sexual behavior of the person. In the  inversion types it can be ascertained that they are altogether  controlled by an archaic constitution and by primitive psychic  mechanisms. The importance of the _narcissistic object selection_ and  the _clinging_ to the erotic significance of the _anal_ zone seem to be  their most essential characteristics. But one gains nothing by  separating the most extreme inversion types from the others on the basis  of such constitutional peculiarities. What is found in the latter as  seemingly an adequate determinant can also be demonstrated only in  lesser force in the constitution of transitional types and in manifestly  normal persons. The differences in the results may be of a qualitative  nature, but analysis shows that the differences in the determinants are  only quantitative. As a remarkable factor among the accidental  influences of the object selection, we found the sexual rejection or the  early sexual intimidation, and our attention was also called to the fact  that the existence of both parents plays an important role in the  child's life. The disappearance of a strong father in childhood not  infrequently favors the inversion. Finally, one might demand that the  inversion of the sexual object should notionally be strictly separated  from the mixing of the sex characteristics in the subject. A certain  amount of independence is unmistakable also in this relation.    [12] Although psychoanalysis has not yet given us a full explanation for  the origin of inversion, it has revealed the psychic mechanism of its  genesis and has essentially enriched the problems in question. In all  the cases examined we have ascertained that the later inverts go through  in their childhood a phase of very intense but short-lived fixation on  the woman (usually on the mother) and after overcoming it they identify  themselves with the woman and take themselves as the sexual object; that  is, proceeding on a narcissistic basis, they look for young men  resembling themselves in persons whom they wish to love as their mother  has loved them. We have, moreover, frequently found that alleged inverts  are by no means indifferent to the charms of women, but the excitation  evoked by the woman is always transferred to a male object. They thus  repeat through life the mechanism which gave origin to their inversion.  Their obsessive striving for the man proves to be determined by their  restless flight from the woman.    [13] The most pronounced difference between the sexual life  (Liebesleben) of antiquity and ours lies in the fact that the ancients  placed the emphasis on the impulse itself, while we put it on its  object. The ancients extolled the impulse and were ready to ennoble  through it even an inferior object, while we disparage the activity of  the impulse as such and only countenance it on account of the merits of  the object.    [14] I must mention here that the blind obedience evinced by the  hypnotized subject to the hypnotist causes me to think that the nature  of hypnosis is to be found in the unconscious fixation of the libido on  the person of the hypnotizer (by means of the masochistic component of  the sexual impulse).    Ferenczi connects this character of suggestibility with the \"parent  complex\" (Jahrbuch fuer Psychoanalytische und psychopathologische  Forschungen, I, 1909).    [15] Moreover, it is to be noted that sexual overvaluation does not  become pronounced in all mechanisms of object selection, and that we  shall later learn to know another and more direct explanation for the  sexual role of the other parts of the body.    [16] Further investigations lead to the conclusion that I. Bloch has  overestimated the factor of excitement-hunger (Reizhunger). The various  roads upon which the libido moves behave to each other from the very  beginning like communicating pipes; the factor of collateral streaming  must also be considered.    [17] This weakness corresponds to the constitutional predisposition. The  early sexual intimidation which pushes the person away from the normal  sexual aim and urges him to seek a substitute, has been demonstrated by  psychoanalysis, as an accidental determinant.    [18] The shoe or slipper is accordingly a symbol for the female  genitals.    [19] Psychoanalysis has filled up the gap in the understanding of  fetichisms by showing that the selection of the fetich depends on a  coprophilic smell-desire which has been lost by repression. Feet and  hair are strong smelling objects which are raised to fetiches after the  renouncing of the now unpleasant sensation of smell. Accordingly, only  the filthy and ill-smelling foot is the sexual object in the perversion  which corresponds to the foot fetichism. Another contribution to the  explanation of the fetichistic preference of the foot is found in the  Infantile Sexual Theories (see later). The foot replaces the penis which  is so much missed in the woman. In some cases of foot fetichism it could  be shown that the desire for looking originally directed to the  genitals, which wished to reach its object from below, was stopped on  the way by prohibition and repression, and therefore adhered to the foot  or shoe as a fetich. In conformity with infantile expectation, the  female genital was hereby imagined as a male genital.    [20] I have no doubt that the conception of the \"beautiful\" is rooted in  the soil of sexual excitement and originally signified the sexual  excitant. The more remarkable, therefore, is the fact that the genitals,  the sight of which provokes the greatest sexual excitement, can really  never be considered \"beautiful.\"    [21] Cf. here the later communication on the pregenital phases of the  sexual development, in which this view is confirmed. See below,  \"Ambivalence.\"    [22] Instead of substantiating this statement by many examples I will  merely cite Havelock Ellis (The Sexual Impulse, 1903): \"All known cases  of sadism and masochism, even those cited by v. Krafft-Ebing, always  show (as has already been shown by Colin, Scott, and Fere) traces of  both groups of manifestations in the same individual.\"    [23] On the other hand the restricting forces of the sexual  evolution--disgust, shame, morality--must also be looked upon as  historic precipitates of the outer inhibitions which the sexual impulse  experienced in the psychogenesis of humanity. One can observe that they  appear in their time during the development of the individual almost  spontaneously at the call of education and influence.    [24] Studien ueber Hysterie, 1895, J. Breuer tells of the patient on whom  he first practiced the cathartic method: \"The sexual factor was  surprisingly undeveloped.\"    [25] The well-known fancies of perverts which under favorable conditions  are changed into contrivances, the delusional fears of paranoiacs which  are in a hostile manner projected on others, and the unconscious fancies  of hysterics which are discovered in their symptoms by psychoanalysis,  agree as to content in the minutest details.    [26] A psychoneurosis very often associates itself with a manifest  inversion in which the heterosexual feeling becomes subjected to  complete repression.--It is but just to state that the necessity of a  general recognition of the tendency to inversion in psychoneurotics was  first imparted to me personally by Wilh. Fliess, of Berlin, after I had  myself discovered it in some cases.    [27] It is not easy to justify here this assumption which was taken from  a definite class of neurotic diseases. On the other hand, it would be  impossible to assert anything definite concerning the impulses if one  did not take the trouble of mentioning these presuppositions.    [28] One should here "]]]
