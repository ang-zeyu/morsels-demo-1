[Footnote 52: Garcilasso says over three hundred!  (Com. Real.,  Parte 1, lib. 3, cap. 19.) The fact, though rather startling, is  not incredible, if, like Huayna Capac, they counted seven hundred  wives in their seraglio.  See Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 7.]    [Footnote 53: Garcilasso mentions a class of Incas por  privilegio, who were allowed to possess the name and many of the  immunities of the blood royal, though only descended from the  great vassals that first served under the banner of Manco Capac.  (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 1, cap. 22.) This important fact, to  which he often refers, one would be glad to see confirmed by a  single authority.]    They were distinguished by many exclusive and very important  privileges; they wore a peculiar dress; spoke a dialect, if we  may believe the chronicler, peculiar to themselves; *54 and had  the choicest portion of the public domain assigned for their  support.  They lived, most of them, at court, near the person of  the prince, sharing in his counsels, dining at his board, or  supplied from his table.  They alone were admissible to the great  offices in the priesthood.  They were invested with the command  of armies, and of distant garrisons, were placed over the  provinces, and, in short, filled every station of high trust and  emolument. *55 Even the laws, severe in their general tenor, seem  not to have been framed with reference to them; and the people,  investing the whole order with a portion of the sacred character  which belonged to the sovereign, held that an Inca noble was  incapable of crime. *56    [Footnote 54: \"Los Incas tuvieron otra Lengua particular, que  hablavan entre ellos, que no la entendian los demas Indios, ni  les era licito aprenderla, como Lenguage Divino.  Esta me  escriven del Peru, que se ha perdido totalmente; porque como  perecio la Republica particular de los Incas, perecio tambien el  Lenguage dellos.\" Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 7, cap.  1]    [Footnote 55: \"Una sola gente hallo yo que era exenta, que eran  los Ingas del Cuzco y por alli al rededor de ambas parcialidades,  porque estos no solo no pagavan tributo, pero aun comian de lo  que traian al Inga de todo el reino, y estos eran por la mayor  parte los Governadores en todo el reino, y por donde quiera que  iban se les hacia mucha honrra.\" Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms.]    [Footnote 56: Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte I, lib. 2, cap. 15.]  The other order of nobility was the Curacas, the caciques of the  conquered nations, or their descendants.  They were usually  continued by the government in their places, though they were  required to visit the capital occasionally, and to allow their  sons to be educated there as the pledges of their loyalty.  It is  not easy to define the nature or extent of their privileges.  They were possessed of more or less power, according to the  extent of their patrimony, and the number of their vassals.  Their authority was usually transmitted from father to son,  though sometimes the successor was chosen by the people. *57 They  did not occupy the highest posts of state, or those nearest the  person of the sovereign, like the nobles of the blood. Their  authority seems to have been usually local, and always in  subordination to the territorial jurisdiction of the great  provincial governors, who were taken from the Incas. *58    [Footnote 57: In this event, it seems, the successor named was  usually presented to the Inca for confirmation.  (Dec. de la Aud.  Real., Ms.) At other times, the Inca himself selected the heir  from among the children of the deceased Curaca.  \"In short,\" says  Ondegardo, \"there was no rule of succession so sure, but it might  be set aside by the supreme will of the sovereign.' Rel. Prim.,  Ms.]    [Footnote 58: Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 4, cap. 10. -  Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 11 - Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms. -  Cieza de Leon, Cronica, cap. 93. - Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.]    It was the Inca nobility, indeed, who constituted the real  strength of the Peruvian monarchy.  Attached to their prince by  ties of consanguinity, they had common sympathies and, to a  considerable extent, common interests with him.  Distinguished by  a peculiar dress and insignia, as well as by language and blood,  from the rest of the community, they were never confounded with  the other tribes and nations who were incorporated into the great  Peruvian monarchy.  After the lapse of centuries, they still  retained their individuality as a peculiar people.  They were to  the conquered races of the country what the Romans were to the  barbarous hordes of the Empire, or the Normans to the ancient  inhabitants of the British Isles.  Clustering around the throne,  they formed an invincible phalanx, to shield it alike from secret  conspiracy and open insurrection.  Though living chiefly in the  capital, they were also distributed throughout the country in all  its high stations and strong military posts, thus establishing  lines of communication with the court, which enabled the  sovereign to act simultaneously and with effect on the most  distant quarters of his empire.  They possessed, moreover, an  intellectual preeminence, which, no less than their station, gave  them authority with the people.  Indeed, it may be said to have  been the principal foundation of their authority.  The crania of  the Inca race show a decided superiority over the other races of  the land in intellectual power; *59 and it cannot be denied that  it was the fountain of that peculiar civilization and social  polity, which raised the Peruvian monarchy above every other  state in South America.  Whence this remarkable race came, and  what was its early history, are among those mysteries that meet  us so frequently in the annals of the New World, and which time  and the antiquary have as vet done little to explain.    [Footnote 59: Dr. Morton's valuable work contains several  engravings of both the Inca and the common Peruvian skull,  showing that the facial angle in the former, though by no means  great, was much larger than that in the latter, which was  singularly flat and deficient in intellectual character.

If we are surprised at the peculiar and original features of what  may be called the Peruvian aristocracy, we shall be still more so  as we descend to the lower orders of the community, and see the  very artificial character of their institutions, - as artificial  as those of ancient Sparta, and, though in a different way, quite  as repugnant to the essential principles of our nature. The  institutions of Lycurgus, however, were designed for a petty  state, while those of Peru, although originally intended for  such, seemed, like the magic tent in the Arabian tale, to have an  indefinite power of expansion, and were as well suited to the  most flourishing condition of the empire as to its infant  fortunes.  In this remarkable accommodation to change of  circumstances we see the proofs of a contrivance that argues no  slight advance in civilization.    The name of Peru was not known to the natives.  It was given by  the Spaniards, and originated, it is said, in a misapprehension  of the Indian name of \"river.\" *1 However this may be, it is  certain that the natives had no other epithet by which to  designate the large collection of tribes and nations who were  assembled under the sceptre of the Incas, than that of  Tavantinsuyu, or \"four quarters of the world.\" *2 This will not  surprise a citizen of the United States, who has no other name by  which to class himself among nations than what is borrowed from a  quarter of the globe. *3 The kingdom, conformably to its name,  was divided into four parts, distinguished each by a separate  title, and to each of which ran one of the four great roads that  diverged from Cuzco, the capital or navel of the Peruvian  monarchy.  The city was in like manner divided into four  quarters; and the various races, which gathered there from the  distant parts of the empire, lived each in the quarter nearest to  its respective province.  They all continued to wear their  peculiar national costume, so that it was easy to determine their  origin; and the same order and system of arrangement prevailed in  the motley population of the capital, as in the great provinces  of the empire.  The capital, in fact, was a miniature image of  the empire. *4    [Footnote 1: Pelu, according to Garcilasso, was the Indian name  for \"river,\" and was given by one of the natives in answer to a  question put to him by the Spaniards, who conceived it to be the  name of the country.  (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 1, cap. 6.) Such  blunders have led to the names of many places both in North and  South America.  Montesinos, however, denies that there is such an  Indian term for \"river.\" (Mem. Antiguas, Ms., lib. 1, cap. 2.)  According to this writer, Peru was the ancient Ophir, whence  Solomon drew such stores of wealth; and which, by a very natural  transition, has in time been corrupted into Phiru, Piru, Peru!  The first book of the Memorias, consisting of thirty-two  chapters, is devoted to this precious discovery.]    [Footnote 2: Ondegardo, Rel.

His principal poem, _The  Bruce_, was in progress in 1376. It consists of 14,000 octosyllabic  lines, and celebrates the praises of Robert the Bruce and James Douglas,  the flowers of Scottish chivalry. This poem is almost the sole authority  on the history it deals with, but is much more than a rhyming chronicle;  it contains many fine descriptive passages, and sings the praises of  freedom. Its style is somewhat bald and severe. Other poems ascribed to  B. are _The Legend of Troy_, and _Legends of the Saints_, probably  translations. B. devoted a perpetual annuity of 20 shillings, bestowed  upon him by the King, to provide for a mass to be sung for himself and  his parents, and this was duly done in the church of St. Machar until the  Reformation.    _The Bruce_, edited by C.

He is remembered for his satirical poem, _The Ship of  Fools_ (1509), partly a translation, which is of interest as throwing  light on the manners and customs of the times to which it refers. He also  translated Sallust's _Bellum Jugurthinum_, and the _Mirrour of Good  Manners_, from the Italian of Mancini, and wrote five _Eclogues_. His  style is stiff and his verse uninspired.      BARCLAY, JOHN (1582-1621).--Satirist, _s._ of a Scotsman, who was  Professor of Law at Pont-a-Mousson, Lorraine, came with his _f._ to  England about 1603. He wrote several works in English and Latin, among  which are _Euphormionis Satyricon_, against the Jesuits, and _Argenis_, a  political romance, resembling in certain respects the _Arcadia_ of  Sidney, and the _Utopia_ of More.      BARCLAY, ROBERT (1648-1690).--Apologist of the Quakers, _s._ of Col.  David B. of Ury, _ed._ at the Scots Coll. in Paris, of which his uncle  was Rector, made such progress in study as to gain the admiration of his  teachers, specially of his uncle, who offered to make him his heir if he  would remain in France, and join the Roman Catholic Church. This he  refused to do, and, returning to Scotland, he in 1667 adopted the  principles of the Quakers as his _f._ had already done. Soon afterwards  he began to write in defence of his sect, by _pub._ in 1670 _Truth  cleared of Calumnies_, and _a Catechism and Confession of Faith_ (1673).  His great work, however, is his _Apology for the Quakers_, _pub._ in  Latin in 1676, and translated into English in 1678. It is a weighty and  learned work, written in a dignified style, and was eagerly read. It,  however, failed to arrest the persecution to which the Quakers were  exposed, and B. himself, on returning from the Continent, where he had  gone with Foxe and Penn, was imprisoned, but soon regained his liberty,  and was in the enjoyment of Court favour. He was one of the twelve  Quakers who acquired East New Jersey, of which he was appointed nominal  Governor. His latter years were spent at his estate of Ury, where he _d._  The essential view which B. maintained was, that Christians are  illuminated by an inner light superseding even the Scriptures as the  guide of life. His works have often been reprinted.      BARHAM, RICHARD HARRIS (1788-1845).--Novelist and humorous poet, _s._ of  a country gentleman, was _b._ at Canterbury, _ed._ at St. Paul's School  and Oxford, entered the church, held various incumbencies, and was  Divinity Lecturer, and minor canon of St. Paul's. It is not, however, as  a churchman that he is remembered, but as the author of the _Ingoldsby  Legends_, a series of comic and serio-comic pieces in verse, sparkling  with wit, and full of striking and often grotesque turns of expression,  which appeared first in _Bentley's Miscellany_. He also wrote, in  _Blackwood's Magazine_, a novel, _My Cousin Nicholas_.      BARLOW, JOEL (1754-1812).--Poet, _b._ at Reading, Connecticut, served for  a time as an army chaplain, and thereafter betook himself to law, and  finally to commerce and diplomacy, in the former of which he made a  fortune. He was much less successful as a poet than as a man of affairs.  His writings include _Vision of Columbus_ (1787), afterwards expanded  into the _Columbiad_ (1807), _The Conspiracy of Kings_ (1792), and _The  Hasty Pudding_ (1796), a mock-heroic poem, his best work. These are  generally pompous and dull. In 1811 he was _app._ ambassador to France,  and met his death in Poland while journeying to meet Napoleon.      BARNARD, LADY ANNE (LINDSAY) (1750-1825).--Poet, _e. dau._ of the 5th  Earl of Balcarres, married Andrew Barnard, afterwards Colonial Secretary  at Cape Town. On the _d._ of her husband in 1807 she settled in London.  Her exquisite ballad of _Auld Robin Gray_ was written in 1771, and _pub._  anonymously. She confessed the authorship to Sir Walter Scott in 1823.      BARNES, BARNABE (1569?-1609).--Poet, _s._ of Dr. Richard B. Bishop, of  Durham, was _b._ in Yorkshire, and studied at Oxford. He wrote  _Parthenophil_, a collection of sonnets, madrigals, elegies, and odes, _A  Divine Centurie of Spirituall Sonnets_, and _The Devil's Charter_, a  tragedy. When at his best he showed a true poetic vein.      BARNES, WILLIAM (1801-1886).--Poet and philologist, _s._ of a farmer,  _b._ at Rushay, Dorset. After being a solicitor's clerk and a  schoolmaster, he entered the Church, in which he served various cures.  He first contributed to a newspaper, _Poems in Dorset Dialect_,  separately _pub._ in 1844. _Hwomely Rhymes_ followed in 1858, and a  collected edition of his poems appeared in 1879. His philological works  include _Philological Grammar_ (1854), _Se Gefylsta, an Anglo-Saxon  Delectus_ (1849). _Tiw, or a View of Roots_ (1862), and a _Glossary of  Dorset Dialect_ (1863). B.'s poems are characterised by a singular  sweetness and tenderness of feeling, deep insight into humble country  life and character, and an exquisite feeling for local scenery.      BARNFIELD, RICHARD (1574-1627).--Poet, _e.s._ of Richard B., gentleman,  was _b._ at Norbury, Shropshire, and _ed._ at Oxford. In 1594 he _pub._  _The Affectionate Shepherd_, a collection of variations in graceful verse  of the 2nd Eclogue of Virgil. His next work was _Cynthia, with certain  Sonnets and the Legend of Cassandra_ in 1595; and in 1598 there appeared  a third vol., _The Encomion of Lady Pecunia, etc._, in which are two  songs (\"If music and sweet poetrie agree,\" and \"As it fell upon a day\")  also included in _The Passionate Pilgrim_, an unauthorised collection,  and which were long attributed to Shakespeare. From this time, 1599, B.  produced nothing else, and seems to have retired to the life of a country  gentleman at Stone in Staffordshire, in the church of which he was buried  in 1627. He was for long neglected; but his poetry is clear, sweet, and  musical. His gift indeed is sufficiently attested by work of his having  passed for that of Shakespeare.      BARROW, ISAAC (1630-1677).--Divine, scholar, and mathematician, _s._ of a  linen-draper in London, was _ed._ at Charterhouse, Felsted, Peterhouse,  and Trinity Coll., Cambridge, where his uncle and namesake, afterwards  Bishop of St. Asaph, was a Fellow. As a boy he was turbulent and  pugnacious, but soon took to hard study, distinguishing himself in  classics and mathematics. Intending originally to enter the Church, he  was led to think of the medical profession, and engaged in scientific  studies, but soon reverted to his first views. In 1655 he became  candidate for the Greek Professorship at Cambridge, but was unsuccessful,  and travelled for four years on the Continent as far as Turkey. On his  return he took orders, and, in 1660, obtained the Greek Chair at  Cambridge, and in 1662 the Gresham Professorship of Geometry, which he  resigned on being appointed first Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in  the same university. During his tenure of this chair he _pub._ two  mathematical works of great learning and elegance, the first on Geometry  and the second on Optics. In 1669 he resigned in favour of his pupil,  Isaac Newton, who was long considered his only superior among English  mathematicians. About this time also he composed his _Expositions of the  Creed_, _The Lord's Prayer_, _Decalogue_, and _Sacraments_. He was made a  D.D. by royal mandate in 1670, and two years later Master of Trinity  Coll., where he founded the library. Besides the works above mentioned,  he wrote other important treatises on mathematics, but in literature his  place is chiefly supported by his sermons, which are masterpieces of  argumentative eloquence, while his treatise on the _Pope's Supremacy_ is  regarded as one of the most perfect specimens of controversy in  existence. B.'s character as a man was in all respects worthy of his  great talents, though he had a strong vein of eccentricity. He _d._  unmarried in London at the early age of 47. B.'s theological works were  edited by Napier, with memoir by Whewell (9 vols., 1839).      BARTON, BERNARD (1784-1849).--Poet, _b._ of Quaker parentage, passed  nearly all his life at Woodbridge, for the most part as a clerk in a  bank. He became the friend of Southey, Lamb, and other men of letters.  His chief works are _The Convict's Appeal_ (1818), a protest against the  severity of the criminal code of the time, and _Household Verses_ (1845),  which came under the notice of Sir R. Peel, through whom he obtained a  pension of L100. With the exception of some hymns his works are now  nearly forgotten, but he was a most amiable and estimable man--simple and  sympathetic. His _dau._ Lucy, who married Edward Fitzgerald, the  translator of _Omar Khayyam_, _pub._ a selection of his poems and  letters, to which her husband prefixed a"]]]
