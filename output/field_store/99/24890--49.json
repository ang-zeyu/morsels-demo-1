Once a simulation is a success, the main ZAM will activate the action (in  connection with local-ZM). The action will be the same as the simulated  action. This procedure is followed by any ZAM in any activity.    There are some exceptions. When the PSM takes control, some reflex-models are  activated without initialization and without simulation. The reason is the  highest speed of action, even if the action is not the right one.        ACTIVE-TYPE MODELS (normal ZM-models)    ZM models are made mainly by direct interaction with the external reality.  They generate the knowledge and consciousness. They are self-activated in any  situation when they are able to predict in a good way the possible evolution  of a given external reality.    A ZM, which interacts directly with the external reality, is also a model,  which controls the whole body. They build, activate and deactivate any ZAM,  based on a set of goals.    A long-range ZM model also controls a local-ZM. This is able to modify a  local-ZM model, based on long-range predictions.    The whole activity is supervised by PSM. Usually the PSM is activated only  when all the available ZMs fail to control the interaction with the external  reality.    A ZM model has full access to all the resources of the brain. It can take any  information from any part of the brain and can make any model based on any  available information.    By analyzing the normal activity of the brain, one understands that some  activities use only a limited number of models. The access to some models is  easier than to others. We can find very fast some information and find more  slowly other. This suggests that some models, which are usually employed  together, are grouped. We define a quasi-structure of models called MZM. A MZM  is a group of models, which are used often together. They can be associated  with some specific complex activities (job, hobby, family life, car driving  and so on).      STORY-TYPE MODELS    These are transition-ZMs. When there are some information from the external  reality, the normal activity of the brain is to build a normal ZM-model or to  find the best available ZM to integrate that information.    When the quantity of information is high, the brain has no technical  possibility to follow this normal mode of interaction. It is forced just to  record the information in a string-type mode. Such a record of data is called  a story-type model (S-M).    Note: some persons who already read this book were disturbed by the fact that  there are many sequences which are repeated in different parts of the book.  Unfortunately for such persons, this happened because they make story-type  models instead of a normal model. If they make story-type models and if there  is a repeated sequence, the local-ZM will jump back to the place where the  information was previously met. At that moment, the story-type models are  fragmenting. The person has lost the connection with the story-type model and  is forced to make a new one. Also, the person could try to reconnect the old  model with the new one, but this is difficult. For a person who makes a normal  model, when a sequence is repeated, this sequence will only confirm the  normal model and this is very good for the model.    Story-type models can be used as a source of information to make or develop,  off-line, normal models. Any element of such models can be developed as a  normal model later.    Although many people use this type of interaction with the external reality,  this mode of interaction is not efficient and uses a lot of the limited  resources of the brain.    Indeed, a story-type-model records the information in an explicit way, about  the same way as it is recorded on a tape-recorder. This mode is a very  primitive way of recording data. A normal model can generate a huge quantity  of information by simulation. Such information is not recorded there in an  explicit way.    Even more, a story-type model introduces non-normal relations between some  elements. As we know, a story-type model is made by elements connected between  them in the order of occurrence. So, two elements, which could have no  connection between them, could be recorded with a relation between them if  they occurred together. Anyway, there is no control and no long-range model to  control the recording of a story-type model.    Unfortunately, such models are very spread out all over the world, due to the  fact that there is too much information, and due to some big deficiencies of  the education policy.    So, an education based on normal models will reduce very much the quantity of  information, which has to be processed by a brain. The present education  policy is based on assimilation of external models. That is, the capacity to  build models is not used. So, faced with a huge quantity of information, the  population is forced to make story-type models. This will reduce even more the  capacity of the population to make normal models.    Example: a taxi driver must know any route in a city. There is a huge number  of such routes and he has to learn each, both directions. If the normal model  of the city is learned, then that taxi driver is able to find a route in any  conditions. Except for the normal model of the city, it is not necessary to  learn anything else. By story-type models (to learn routes) he has to increase  the quantity of information with every new route. This is an example, but the  situation is met in almost any field of activity. In practice, both methods  are used.    Story-type models developed as long-range models are very dangerous, because  they can stimulate induced-paranoia (XIP) or a schizophrenic-paranoiac complex  (XSPC). This is so because a story-type model has special relations between  its elements. Such relations are generated by the arbitrary occurrence of the  elements and thus, to transform the story-type model into a family of normal  models becomes difficult (the brain has to build from scratch several new  normal models, based on the information generated by a story-type model, and  this is not easy).    The story-type models are integrated in the normal structure of models and  they are controlled by that structure.      SHIELDING MODELS    We already saw that any model evolves independently, by itself, based on the  information taken from external reality or from others models. The aim of any  model is to gain its stability. Once a model has a problem, it will continue  to be active up to the moment when it regains stability.    There are some problems without solution. The model will continue to look for  a solution forever. This activity can produce negative effects on the overall  stability of the structure of models of the brain (it consumes a lot of  energy).    The main problem without solution is death (human beings only).    This is a basic problem. So, there is a model which predicts the death of a  person and that model has no solution to the problem.  When there is no model  to solve a problem, the PSM is activated. The PSM has no solution too and so  it will make a specific model to solve the problem. But the new model has no  solution either, and so, a dangerous loop is activated. This activity could be  very dangerous for the stability of the structure of models of any mature  human being.    Since the oldest times, the human beings found a solution: shielding models.    A shielding model is a model, which is made to prevent a normal model from  activating the PSM and also to transmit to the model with problems some  information to stabilize it.    The best-known shielding model is religion.    Observation: as a person becomes older and older, the prediction of death is  more and more precise. The person has the tendency to become more and more  religious. Also, when a population is under stress, it has also the tendency  to become more and more religious.    A shielding model is associated to a normal model which has problems. A  shielding model is not based on external reality. It cannot be included in a  normal model, as the normal model cannot include a model which is not based on  external reality.    The reality generated by a shielding model can be called \"illusion\".    The shielding model can be made for any problem without solution. Such models  reduce the nonsense activity of a brain and so, there is more energy to solve  the normal problems. But, such models could be also very dangerous. The  activation of a shielding model also deactivates the protection structure of a  person or at least some section of it.    The shielding models are the main models, which can pass from 'normal-to-PSM'  zone to PSM. Such changes could be very dangerous for that being, because some  protection models are deactivated forever.    The shielding models are partially integrated in the normal structure of  models and so, the structure can, partially, control them.      ACTIVABLE MODELS (WBAM)    A ZM could predict a future situation of the external reality, which has no  associated model. Such a situation can activate the PSM. To prevent this, the  ZM can make a would-be active-type model (WBAM). Such a model is not created  by direct interaction with the external reality. Such a WBAM acts as a  shielding model up to the last moment before the activation. After activation,  it becomes a normal ZM model.    A normal ZM is built in direct interaction with external reality. WBAMs can be  associated with the external reality without previous interaction with it.    Note: the emotion is defined in MDT as a transient situation between the  activation of the PSM and the moment when a normal suitable model is  activated. The activation of the PSM can be prevented by a good WBAM (of  course, if that situation was predicted by a main ZM).    WBAMs are included in the normal structure of the models and they are  controlled by it.        ILLEGAL"]]]
