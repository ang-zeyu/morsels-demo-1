Is it  surprising that Hindus should turn their backs upon our civilization[2]  when a European of highly-trained intellectual power and with an  extraordinary gift of eloquence comes and tells them that it is they who  possess and have from all times possessed the key to supreme wisdom;  that their gods, their philosophy, their morality are on a higher plane  of thought than the West has ever reached? Is it surprising that with  such encouragement Hinduism should no longer remain on the defensive,  but, discarding in this respect all its own traditions as a  non-proselytizing creed, should send out missionaries to preach the  message of Hindu enlightenment to those still groping in the darkness of  the West? The mission of Swami Vivekananda to the Chicago Congress of  Religions is in itself one of the most striking incidents in the history  of Hindu revivalism, but it is perhaps less wonderful than the triumph  he achieved when he returned to India accompanied by a chosen band of  eager disciples from the West.    There are, indeed, endless forms to this revival of Hinduism--as endless  as to Hinduism itself--but what it is perhaps most important for us to  note is that, wherever political agitation assumes the most virulent  character, there the Hindu revival also assumes the most extravagant  shapes. Secret societies place their murderous activities under the  special patronage of one or other of the chief popular deities. Their  vows are taken \"on the sacred water of the Ganges,\" or \"holding the  sacred Tulsi plant,\" or \"in the presence of Mahadevi\"--the great  goddess who delights in bloody sacrifices, Charms and amulets,  incantations and imprecations, play an important part in the ceremonies  of initiation. In some quarters there has been some recrudescence of  the _Shakti_ cultus, with its often obscene and horrible rites, and the  unnatural depravity which was so marked a feature in the case of the  band of young Brahmans who conspired to murder Mr. Jackson at Nasik  represents a form of erotomania which is certainly much more common  amongst Hindu political fanatics than amongst Hindus in general.    By no means all, however, are of this degenerate type, and the _Bhagvat  Gita_ has been impressed into the service of sedition by men who would  have been as incapable of dabbling in political as in any other form of  crime, had they not been able to invest it with a religious sanction.  There is no more beautiful book in the sacred literature of the Hindus;  there is none in which the more enlightened find greater spiritual  comfort; yet it is in the _Bhagvat Gita_ that, by a strange perversion,  the Hindu conspirator has sought and claims to have found texts that  justify murder as a divinely inspired deed when it is committed in the  sacred cause of Hinduism. Nor is it only the extremists who appeal in  this fashion to Hindu religious emotionalism. It is often just as  difficult to appraise the subtle differences which separate the  \"moderate\" from the \"advanced\" politician and the \"advanced\" politician  from the extremist as it is to distinguish between the various forms and  gradations of the Hindu revival in its religious and social aspects. But  it was in the courtyard of the great temple of Kali at Calcutta in the  presence of \"the terrible goddess\" that the \"leaders of the Bengali  nation,\" men who, like Mr. Surendranath Banerjee, have always professed  to be \"moderates,\" held their chief demonstrations against \"partition\"  and administered the _Swadeshi_ oath to their followers. Equally  noteworthy is the part played by the revival of Ganpati celebrations in  honour of Ganesh, the elephant-headed god, perhaps the most popular of  all Hindu deities, in stimulating political disaffection in the Deccan.    Hand in hand with this campaign for the glorification of Hinduism at the  expense of Western civilization there has been carried on another and  far more invidious campaign for the vilification of everything British.  The individual Englishman is denounced as a bloodsucker and a tyrant;  his personal integrity is impugned and derided; his methods of  administration are alleged to be wilfully directed to the  impoverishment, and even to the depopulation, of India; his social  customs are traduced as depraved and corrupt; even his women-folk are  accused of common wantonness. This systematized form of personal calumny  is a scarcely less significant feature of the literature of Indian  unrest than its appeals to the Hindu scriptures and to the Hindu deities  and its exploitation of the religious sentiment for the promotion of  racial hatred. _Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_ are the battle-cries of this new  Hindu \"nationalism,\" but they mean far more than a mere claim to fiscal  or even political independence. They mean an organized uplifting of the  old Hindu traditions, social and religious, intellectual and moral,  against the imported ideals of an alien race and an alien civilization,  and the sincerity of some, at least, of the apostles of this new creed  cannot be questioned. With Mr. Arabindo Ghose, they firmly believe that  \"the whole moral strength of the country is with us, justice is with us,  nature is with us, and the law of God, which is higher than any human  law, justifies our action.\"    This is a grave phenomenon not to be contemptuously dismissed as the  folly of ill-digested knowledge or summarily judged and condemned, in a  spirit of self-righteousness, as an additional proof of the innate  depravity and ingratitude of the East. It undoubtedly represents a deep  stirring of the waters amongst a people endowed with no mean gifts of  head and heart, and if it has thrown up much scum, it affords glimpses  of nobler elements which time may purify and bring to the surface. Nor  if our rule and our civilization are to prevail must we be unmindful of  our own responsibility or forget that our presence and the influences we  brought with us first stirred the waters.    The part played by Brahmanism in Indian unrest is far more conspicuous  in some parts of India than in others, and for reasons which are  generally not far to seek. Wherever it has been most active, it connotes  perhaps more than anything else the reactionary side of that unrest.  Though there have been and still are many enlightened Brahmans who have  cordially responded to the best influences of Western education, and  have worked with admirable zeal and courage to bridge the gulf between  Indian and European civilization, Brahmanism as a system represents the  antipodes of all that British rule must stand for in India, and  Brahmanism has from times immemorial dominated Hindu society--dominated  it, according to the Hindu Nationalists, for its salvation. \"If,\" writes  one of them, \"Mother India, though reduced to a mere skeleton by the  oppression of alien rulers during hundreds of years, still preserves her  vitality, it is because the Brahmans have never relaxed in their  devotion to her. She has witnessed political and social revolutions.  Famines and pestilence have shorn her of her splendour. But the Brahmans  have stood by her through all the vicissitudes of fortune. It is they  who raised her to the highest pinnacle of glory, and it is they whose  ministrations still keep up the drooping spirits of her children.\"    The Brahmans are the sacerdotal caste of India. They are at the same  time the proudest and the closest aristocracy that the world has ever  seen, for they form not merely an aristocracy of birth in the strictest  sense of the term, but one of divine origin. Of the Brahman it may be  said as of no other privileged mortal except perhaps the Levite of the  Old Testament: _Nascitur non fit_. No king, however powerful, can make  or unmake a Brahman, no genius, however transcendent, no services,  however conspicuous, no virtues, however pre-eminent, can avail to raise  a Hindu from a lower caste to the Brahman's estate. In early times the  caste laws must have been less rigid, for otherwise there would only be  Aryan Brahmans, whereas in the South of India there are many Brahmans  of obviously Dravidian stock. But to-day not even the Brahmans  themselves can raise to their own equal one who is not born of their  caste, though by the exercise of the castely authority they can in  specific cases outcaste a fellow-Brahman who has offended against the  immutable laws of caste, and, except for minor transgressions which  allow of atonement and reinstatement, when once outcasted he and his  descendants cease for ever to be Brahmans. The Brahmans might be at a  loss to make good their claim that they date back to the remote ages of  the Vedas. But a good deal more than two thousand years have passed  since they constituted themselves the only authorized intermediaries  between mankind and the gods. In them became vested the monopoly of the  ancient language in which all religious rites are performed, and with a  monopoly of the knowledge of Sanskrit they retained a monopoly of  learning long after Sanskrit itself had become a dead language. Like the  priests who wielded a Latin pen in the Middle Ages in Europe, they sat  as advisers and conscience-keepers in the councils of every Hindu ruler.  To the present day they alone can expound the Hindu scriptures, they  alone can approach the gods in their temples, they alone can minister to  the spiritual needs of such of the lower castes as are credited with  sufficient human dignity to be in any way worthy of their ministrations.    In the course of ages differences and distinctions have gradually grown  up amongst them, and they have split up into innumerable septs and  sub-castes. As they multiplied from generation to generation an  increasing proportion were compelled to supplement the avocations  originally sacred to their caste by other and lowlier means of  livelihood. There are to-day over 14 million Brahmans in India, and a  very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#9)"],[1," endure the interminable utterances of the mournful Wotan,  if it were not for the wonderful music that accompanies them. Orpheus  weeping over Eurydice would not move us greatly, if Gluck had not known  how to captivate us by his first notes. If it were not for Mozart's  music, the puppets of the _Magic Flute_ would amount to nothing.    Musicians should, as a matter of fact, be allowed to choose both the  subject and motives for their operas according to their temperaments and  their feelings. Much youthful talent is lost to-day because the young  composers believe that they must obey set rules instead of obeying their  own inspiration. All great artists, the illustrious Richard more than  any other, mocked the critics.    As I have spoken of Richard Wagner's youth, I will take advantage of the  opportunity to reveal a secret of one of his own works which is known to  me alone. When Wagner was young, I was a child and I attended constantly  the sessions of the Societe des Concerts. The kettledrummer of that day  had a peculiar habit of breaking in before the rest of the orchestra.  When the others began, it produced an effect which the authors had  hardly foreseen and which was certain to be condemned. But the effect  had a rather distinctive character and I thought it might be possible to  use it. Richard Wagner lived in Paris at the time and frequented the  famous concerts. There is no doubt that he noted this effect and used it  in his overture to _Faust_.          CHAPTER VII    ART FOR ART'S SAKE      What is Art?    Art is a mystery--something which responds to a special sense, peculiar  to the human race. This is ordinarily called the esthetic sense, but  that is an inexact term, for esthetic sense signifies a sense of the  beautiful and what is esthetic is not necessarily beautiful. Sense of  style would be better.    Some of the savage races have this sense of style, for their arms and  utensils show a remarkable feeling for style, which they lose by contact  with civilization.    By art let us understand, if you please, the Fine Arts alone, but  including decorative art. Music ought to be included.    I shall astonish most of my readers, when I say that very few people  understand music. For most people it is, as Victor Hugo said, an  exhalation of art--something for the ear as perfume is for the olfactory  sense, a source of vague sensations, necessarily unformed as all  sensations are. But musical art is something entirely different. It has  line, modeling, color through instrumentation, all making up an ideal  sphere where some, like the writer of these lines, live from childhood  on, which others attain through education, while many others never know  it at all. Furthermore, musical art has more movement than the other  fine arts. It is the most mysterious of them all, although the others  are mysterious as it is easy to see.    The first manifestation of art occurs through attempts to reproduce  objects. Such attempts have been found which date back to prehistoric  times. But what is primitive man's idea in such attempts? He wants to  record by a line the contour of the object, the likeness of which he  wishes to preserve. This contour and this line do not exist in nature.  The whole philosophy of art is in that crude drawing. It bases itself on  nature even while making something quite different in response to a  special, inexplicable need of the human spirit. Accordingly nothing can  be more chimerical or vain than the advice so often given to the artist  to be truthful. Art can never be true, even though it should not be  false. It should be true artistically, by giving an artistic translation  which will satisfy the sense of style of which we have spoken. When Art  has satisfied this sense of style, the object of artistic expression has  been attained; nothing more can be asked. But it is not the \"vain effort  of an unproductive cleverness,\" as our M. de Mun has said; it is an  effort to satisfy a legitimate need, one of the loftiest and most  honorable in human nature--the need of art.    If this is so, why should we demand that Art be useful or moral? It is  both in its own way, for it awakens noble and honest sentiments in the  soul. That was the opinion of Theophile Gautier, but Victor Hugo  disagreed. The sun is beautiful, he used to say, and it is useful. That  is true, but the sun is not an object of art. Besides, how many times  Victor Hugo denied his own doctrine by writing verses which were merely  brilliant descriptions or admirable bits of imagination?    We are, however, talking of art and not of literature. Literature  becomes art in poetry but forsakes it in prose. Even if some of the  great prose writers rendered their prose artistic through the beauty and  harmony of their periods and the picturesqueness of their expressions,  still prose is not art in its real nature. So, crude indecency aside,  what would be immoral in prose ceases to be immoral in verse, for in  poetry Art follows its own code and form transcends the subject matter.  That is why a great poet, Sully-Prudhomme, preferred prose to verse when  he wanted to write philosophically, for he feared, on account of the  superiority of form to substance in poetry, that his ideas would not be  taken seriously. That explains as well why parents take young girls to  hear an opera, when if the same piece was played without music they  would be appalled at the idea. What Christian is ever shocked by _La  Juive_ or Catholic frightened away from _Les Huguenots_?    Because prose is far removed from art, it is unsuited to music, despite  the fact that this ill-assorted union is fashionable to-day? In poetry  there has been an effort to make it so artistic that form alone is  considered and verse is written which is entirely without sense. But  that is a fad which can't last long.    Sometime ago M. de Mun said:    \"Not to take sides is what the author is inhibited from doing. Art, to  my way of thinking, is a setting forth of ideas. If it is not that--if  it limits itself solely to considerations of form, to a worship of  beauty for its own sake, without regard to the deeds and thoughts it  brings to light, then it seems to me no better than the vain effort of  an unproductive cleverness.\"    The eminent speaker is absolutely right as far as prose is concerned,  but we cannot agree with him if poetry is considered.    Victor Hugo, in his marvellous ode, _La Lyre et La Harpe_ brings  Paganism and Christianity face to face. Each speaks in turn, and the  poet in his last stanza seems to acknowledge that both are right, but  that does not prevent the ode from being a masterpiece. That would  not be possible in prose, but in the poem the poetry carries all before  it.    [Illustration: M. Saint-Saens in his Later Years]    Why is it that geniuses like Victor Hugo, distinguished minds, thinkers,  and profound critics, refuse to see that Art is a special entity which  responds to a certain sense? If Art accommodates itself marvellously, if  it accords itself with the precepts of morality and passion, it is  nevertheless sufficient unto itself--and in its self-sufficiency lies  its heights of greatness.    The first prelude of Sebastian Bach's _Wohltemperirte Klavier_ expresses  nothing, and yet that is one of the marvels of music. The Venus de Milo  expresses nothing, and it is one of the marvels of sculpture.    To tell the truth, it is proper to add that in order not to be immoral  Art must appeal to those who have a feeling for it. Where the artist  sees only beautiful forms, the gross see only nudity. I have seen a good  man scandalized at the sight of Ingres's _La Source_.    Just as morality has no function to be artistic, so Art has nothing to  do with morality. Both have their own functions, and each is useful in  its own way. The final aim of morality is morality; of art, art, and  nothing else.          CHAPTER VIII    POPULAR SCIENCE AND ART      Rene Bazin has sketched cleverly Pasteur's brilliant career. France has  no clearer claim to glory than in Pasteur, for he is one of the men,  who, in spite of everything, keeps her in the first rank of nations.    A rare good fortune attended him. While many scholars who seek the truth  without concerning themselves with the practical results have to wait  many long years before their discoveries can be used, Pasteur's  discoveries were useful at once. So the mob, which cannot understand  science studied for its own sake, appreciated Pasteur's works. He saved  millions to the public treasury, and tens of thousands of human lives.    He had already secured a notable place in science when the public  learned his name through the memorable contest between him and Pouchet  over \"spontaneous generation.\" The probabilities of the case were on  Pouchet's side. People refused to believe that these organisms which  developed in great numbers in an enclosed jar or that the molds which  developed under certain conditions were not produced spontaneously. The  youth of the time went wild over the question.    I was constantly being asked, \"Are you for Pouchet or Pasteur?\" and my  invariable response was, \"I shall be for the one who proves he is  right.\" I was unwilling to admit that any such question could be solved  _a priori_ in accordance with preconceived ideas, although I must  confess that among my friends I found no one of the same opinion.    We know how Pasteur won a striking victory through his patience and his  genius. He demonstrated that millions and millions of germs are present  in the air about us and that when one of them finds favorable  conditions, a living being appears which engenders others. \"Many are  called, but few are chosen.\" This law may seem unjust, but it is one of  the great laws of Nature.    Pasteur, the great benefactor, whose discoveries did so much for all  classes of society, should have been popular, but he was, on the  contrary, extremely unpopular. "]]]
