Of the period when the  artist was drawing on a large scale with a view to reduction there is  one of the \"Things one would rather have expressed differently\" series  priced at twelve guineas. It gives an indication of the profits du  Maurier sometimes was able to make from the original drawing. For the  sake of comment on the low evening gown the half-dozen figures in this  picture are all in back view. It is rather a dull twelve-guineas-worth.  And this was evidently felt, as it remained unsold. The original of the  very exquisite \"Res angusta domi,\" the beautiful drawing of the nurse by  the child's bed in the children's hospital, which appeared in _Punch_,  vol. cviii. p. 102 (1894), is only priced at \"Ten guineas.\"    Turning over the Museum drawings one often sees the liberties with the  penknife by which the artist would secure difficult effects of snow, or  of light on foliage. And sometimes in the margin there are pencil  studies from which figures in the illustration have been re-drawn. And  nearly always not altogether rubbed out is a first wording of the  legend, repeated in ink in du Maurier's pretty \"hand\" beneath.    In turning over these drawings one finds him doing much more than merely  suggesting pattern work in such things as wall-papers. There is one  floral wall-paper in particular that we find him working out which will  no doubt prove an invaluable reference another day as to the sort of  decoration in which the subjects of Queen Victoria preferred to live, or  were forced to by their tradesmen. Photographs of du Maurier's studio  which appeared in a Magazine illustrating an interview with him at the  time of the \"Trilby\" boom, reveal the squat china jars, the leaf fans,  the upholstered \"cosy corner\" with its row of blue plates, with which  all who know their _Punch_ are familiar, and apparently the very  wall-paper to which we have just referred. It certainly is the mark of a  great artist to take practically whatever is before him for treatment.  The artist with the genius for \"interior\" subjects seems to be able to  re-interpret ugliness itself very often. Du Maurier's weak eyes  prevented him from bearing the strain of outdoor work. He was  practically driven indoors for his subjects; and in taking what was to  hand--the very environment of the kind of people his drawings  describe--he showed considerable genius. He succeeded in making whole  volumes of _Punch_ into a work of criticism on the domestic art of the  nineteenth century.    [Illustration: Illustration for \"The Story of a Feather\" 1867.]    Among the useful skits of du Maurier was that upon the conceited young  man concealing appalling ignorance with the display of a still more  appalling indifference to everything. The drawing among the Print-room  series--\"_It is always well to be well informed_\"--is a good instance.  It reveals a ballroom with couples dancing a quadrille. A lady asks  her partner: \"Who's my sister's partner, vis-a-vis, with the star and  riband?\" He: \"Oh, he--aw--he's Sir Somebody Something, who went  somewhere or othaw to look after some scientific fellaw who was  murdered, or something, by someone--!\" The word _othaw_ in this legend  is itself pictorial. Du Maurier was like our own Max Beerbohm in  this--his legends and drawings were inseparable. We find he has actually  penned in the side margin of the drawing the words \"othaw fellaw,\" we  suppose as a possible variant to \"scientific fellow,\" and in the legend  the word \"other\" has been written over with a thickened  termination--\"_aw._\" The usual first trial of the speech in pencil  remains but partly obliterated by india-rubber at the top of the  drawing.    In his series of \"Happy Thoughts\" du Maurier followed the course of the  sort of rapid thought that precedes a tactful reply with real  psychological skill. Take, for instance, his drawing of an artist  sitting gloomily before his fire, caressed by his wife, who bends over  him, saying, \"You seem depressed, darling. Have you had a pleasant  dinner?\" Edwin: \"Oh, pretty well; Bosse was in the chair, of course. He  praised everybody's work this year except mine.\" Angelina: \"Oh! I'm so  glad. _At last_ he is beginning to look upon you as his rival and his  _only_ one.\" The wings of tact are sympathy. This drawing appeared in  _Punch_, vol. xcvi. p. 222 (1889); it is signed with other drawings from  89 Porchester Terrace, April '89. Drawings in the Museum collection are  signed from \"Stanhope Terrace,\" \"Hampstead,\" \"Drumnadrochit,\" or  apparently from wherever the artist happened to be when executing the  work.    [Illustration]      Section 8    Among our illustrations there is a portrait of Canon Ainger,  representing the artist as a painter. Du Maurier's colour was never such  that an injustice is done to it by reproducing it only by half-tone  process. The interest of this portrait is in the psychological grasp of  character it seems to show. The painter was in the habit of contributing  interior _genre_ scenes in water-colour to the Old Water-colour Society,  of which he was made an Associate in 1881. That may be said against his  painting, which may be said against the painting of so many eminent  black-and-white men who have changed to the art of painting too late in  the day. It shows failure to think in paint. An artist is only a great  \"black-and-white\" artist because he thinks in that medium. Possibly, if  there were no such thing as a \"black-and-white\" art, as we have it in  journalism to-day, some of the greatest men in it would instead have  been great painters. But successful transference to the one art after  unusual mastery has been acquired in the other is rarely witnessed. To  think in line, to see the world as resolving itself into the play of  alternating lines, so to habituate thought and vision to that one  aspect of everything is not the best preparation in the world for seeing  it over again in another art where the element of line is not the chief  incident of the impression to be created. Failure in the one art does  not mean failure as an artist. Those artists who have worked in a  variety of mediums with apparently equal success in each have always  attained the ability to make each medium in turn express the same  personal feeling. But nearly always there is in such cases that  sacrifice of the inherent qualities of one or other of the mediums  employed which a great virtuoso never makes.    Black-and-white men put themselves into an attitude of receptivity  towards that aspect of things which suggests representation in line.  Their acquired sensitiveness in this respect is expressed in the learned  character of their touch in drawing. Painters cultivate a similarly  receptive attitude towards nature, but lay themselves open to receive a  different impression of it. We might say of du Maurier that by the time  he tried to apply himself to painting he had become constitutionally a  black-and-white artist. Moreover, his impaired vision compromised the  more complex range of effect represented in painting in a way that it  never could the simplicity of good black-and-white work. How seriously  threatened du Maurier's sight was at times we may know by the reliance  he put upon being read to by others. Thus only did he manage to keep his  small stock of visual energy in reserve for his artistic work.      Section 9    During the sixties and seventies the artist illustrated many works of  fiction. The most notable instance was Thackeray's _Esmond_ in 1868--a  work which he had long wished to be chosen to illustrate.    Du Maurier had all his life an intense admiration for Thackeray. He  inherited none of Thackeray's bitterness, but upon every other ground as  an author, at least, he descends from Thackeray, notably in the studied  colloquialism of his style when writing, and in a general friendliness  to the Philistine. And in his drawings in _Punch_ his satire is aimed in  the same direction as Thackeray's always was. Like Thackeray, he was  most at home on the plane where a social art, a delicate art of life is  able to flourish. Of the concealed romanticist in du Maurier we have  more than once already spoken. A Romanticist always turns to the past.  Thackeray, in his lectures, also in the house he built for himself, and  in a proposed but never finished history, went back into the past at  least as far as Queen Anne's reign. _Esmond_, also of Queen Anne's  reign, was the expression of a feature of Thackeray's temperament which  never makes its full appearance in any other of his fictions. We believe  that it was his own favourite among his works. But Thackeray did not  succeed in expressing the whole of himself in the romantic vein; perhaps  because he did not cultivate it from the start like Scott and Dumas. He  was able to put more of himself into _Vanity Fair_. To think of  Thackeray is to think first of _Vanity Fair_. From the unerring--because  instinctive--judgment of the world this book received recognition as his  masterpiece.    Du Maurier had not so much of the genuine _flair_ for the eighteenth  century as Thackeray. At heart he was much more in sympathy with the  pre-Raphaelites and the love of early romance, whatever his pretence to  the contrary in his satire, _A Legend of Camelot_. But there was no  illustrator of his time with a greater gift for the romantic novel of  any period; and inevitably, he became, in due course, the illustrator of  _Esmond_.    It is impossible to return to the past except by the path of poetry. It  was possible to du Maurier in his illustrations to _Esmond_, because he  was a poet. He used the effect of fading light in the sky seen through  old leaded windows, and all the resources of poetic effect with a poet's  and not an actor-manager's inspiration, wrapping the tale in the glamour  in which Thackeray conceived it.    In 1865 du Maurier contributed a full page illustration and two  vignettes to Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#9)"],[1,"from Zaru.

CHAPTER II.    _RELIGIOUS ARCHITECTURE_.    In the civil and military architecture of Ancient Egypt brick played the  principal part; but in the religious architecture of the nation it occupied  a very secondary position. The Pharaohs were ambitious of building eternal  dwellings for their deities, and stone was the only material which seemed  sufficiently durable to withstand the ravages of time and man.      I.--MATERIALS AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION.      It is an error to suppose that the Egyptians employed only large blocks for  building purposes. The size of their materials varied very considerably  according to the uses for which they were destined. Architraves, drums of  columns, lintel-stones, and door-jambs were sometimes of great size. The  longest architraves known--those, namely, which bridge the nave of the  hypostyle hall of Karnak--have a mean length of 30 feet. They each contain  40 cubic yards, and weigh about 65 tons. Ordinarily, however, the blocks  are not much larger than those now used in Europe. They measure, that is to  say, about 2-1/2 to 4 feet in height, from 3 to 8 feet in length, and from  2 to 6 feet in thickness.    Some temples are built of only one kind of stone; but more frequently  materials of different kinds are put together in unequal proportions. Thus  the main part of the temples of Abydos consists of very fine limestone; but  in the temple of Seti I., the columns, architraves, jambs, and lintels,--  all parts, in short, where it might be feared that the limestone would not  offer sufficient resistance,--the architect has had recourse to sandstone;  while in that of Rameses II., sandstone, granite, and alabaster were used.  At Karnak, Luxor, Tanis, and Memphis, similar combinations may be seen. At  the Ramesseum, and in some of the Nubian temples, the columns stand on  massive supports of crude brick. The stones were dressed more or less  carefully, according to the positions they were to occupy. When the walls  were of medium thickness, as in most partition walls, they are well wrought  on all sides. When the wall was thick, the core blocks were roughed out as  nearly cubic as might be, and piled together without much care, the hollows  being filled up with smaller flakes, pebbles, or mortar. Casing stones were  carefully wrought on the faces, and the joints dressed for two-thirds or  three-quarters of the length, the rest being merely picked with a point  (Note 6). The largest blocks were reserved for the lower parts of the  building; and this precaution was the more necessary because the architects  of Pharaonic times sank the foundations of their temples no deeper than  those of their houses. At Karnak, they are not carried lower than from 7 to  10 feet; at Luxor, on the side anciently washed by the river, three courses  of masonry, each measuring about 2-1/2 feet in depth, form a great platform  on which the walls rest; while at the Ramesseum, the brickwork bed on  which the colonnade stands does not seem to be more than 10 feet deep.  These are but slight depths for the foundations of such great buildings,  but the experience of ages proves that they are sufficient. The hard and  compact humus of which the soil of the Nile valley is composed, contracts  every year after the subsidence of the inundation, and thus becomes almost  incompressible. As the building progressed, the weight of the  superincumbent masonry gradually became greater, till the maximum of  pressure was attained, and a solid basis secured. Wherever I have bared the  foundations of the walls, I can testify that they have not shifted.    [Illustration: Fig. 52.--Masonry in temple of Seti I. at Abydos.]    The system of construction in force among the ancient Egyptians resembles  in many respects that of the Greeks. The stones are often placed together  with dry joints, and without the employment of any binding contrivance, the  masons relying on the mere weight of the materials to keep them in place.  Sometimes they are held together by metal cramps, or sometimes--as in the  temple of Seti I., at Abydos--by dovetails of sycamore wood bearing the  cartouche of the founder. Most commonly, they are united by a mortar-joint,  more or less thick. All the mortars of which I have collected samples are  thus far of three kinds: the first is white, and easily reduced to an  impalpable powder, being of lime only; the others are grey, and rough to  the touch, being mixtures of lime and sand; while some are of a reddish  colour, owing to the pounded brick powder with which they are mixed. A  judicious use of these various methods enabled the Egyptians to rival the  Greeks in their treatment of regular courses, equal blocks, and upright  joints in alternate bond. If they did not always work equally well, their  shortcomings must be charged to the imperfect mechanical means at their  disposal. The enclosure walls, partitions, and secondary facades were  upright; and they raised the materials by means of a rude kind of crane  planted on the top. The pylon walls and the principal facades (and  sometimes even the secondary facades) were sloped at an angle which varied  according to the taste of the architect. In order to build these, they  formed inclined planes, the slopes of which were lengthened as the  structure rose in height. These two methods were equally perilous; for,  however carefully the blocks might be protected while being raised, they  were constantly in danger of losing their edges or corners, or of being  fractured before they reached the top (Note 7). Thus it was almost always  necessary to re-work them; and the object being to sacrifice as little as  possible of the stone, the workmen often left them of most abnormal shapes  (fig. 52). They would level off one of the side faces, and then the joint,  instead of being vertical, leaned askew. If the block had neither height  nor length to spare, they made up the loss by means of a supplementary  slip. Sometimes even they left a projection which fitted into a  corresponding hollow in the next upper or lower course. Being first of all  expedients designed to remedy accidents, these methods degenerated into  habitually careless ways of working. The masons who had inadvertently  hoisted too large a block, no longer troubled themselves to lower it back  again, but worked it into the building in one or other of the ways before  mentioned. The architect neglected to duly supervise the dressing and  placing of the blocks. He allowed the courses to vary, and the vertical  joints, two or three deep, to come one over the other. The rough work done,  the masons dressed down the stone, reworked the joints, and overlaid the  whole with a coat of cement or stucco, coloured to match the material,  which concealed the faults of the real work. The walls rarely end with a  sharp edge. Bordered with a torus, around which a sculptured riband is  entwined, they are crowned by the _cavetto_ cornice surmounted by a flat  band (fig. 53); or, as at Semneh, by a square cornice; or, as at Medinet  Habu, by a line of battlements. Thus framed in, the walls looked like  enormous panels, each panel complete in itself, without projections and  almost without openings. Windows, always rare in Egyptian architecture, are  mere ventilators when introduced into the walls of temples, being intended  to light the staircases, as in the second pylon of Horemheb at Karnak, or  else to support decorative woodwork on festival days. The doorways project  but slightly from the body of the buildings (fig. 54), except where the  lintel is over-shadowed by a projecting cornice. Real windows occur only in  the pavilion of Medinet Habu; but that building was constructed on the  model of a fortress, and must rank as an exception among religious  monuments.    [Illustration: Fig. 53.--Temple wall with cornice.]    [Illustration: Fig. 54.--Niche and doorway in temple of Seti I. at Abydos.]    [Illustration: Fig. 55.--Pavement of the portico of Osiris in the temple of  Seti I. at Abydos.]    The ground-level of the courts and halls was flagged with rectangular  paving stones, well enough fitted, except in the intercolumniations, where  the architects, hopeless of harmonising the lines of the pavement with the  curved bases of the columns, have filled in the space with small pieces,  set without order or method (fig. 55). Contrary to their practice when  house building, they have scarcely ever employed the vault or arch in  temple architecture. We nowhere meet with it, except at Deir el Bahari, and  in the seven parallel sanctuaries of Abydos. Even in these instances, the  arch is produced by \"corbelling\"; that is to say, the curve is formed by  three or four superimposed horizontal courses of stone,"]]]
