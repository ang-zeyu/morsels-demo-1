[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#9)"],[1,"Earlier results of the same investigation were  given in the Sunday magazine of one of the Chicago papers.    From the _Journal of Heredity_ was gleaned material for an article  entitled \"What Chance Has the Poor Child?\" It was printed in _Every  Week_.    \"Golfer's Foot, One of Our Newest Diseases,\" was the subject of a  special feature in the _New York Times_, that was based on an article in  the _Medical Record_.    That the canals on Mars may be only an optical illusion was demonstrated  in an article in the Sunday magazine of the _New York Times_, by means  of material obtained from a report of the section for the Observation of  Mars, a division of the British Astronomical Association.    ANTICIPATING TIMELY SUBJECTS. By looking forward for weeks or even  months, as editors of Sunday newspapers and of magazines are constantly  doing, a writer can select subjects and gather material for articles  that will be particularly appropriate at a given time. Holidays,  seasonal events, and anniversaries may thus be anticipated, and special  articles may be sent to editors some time in advance of the occasion  that makes them timely. Not infrequently it is desirable to begin  collecting material a year before the intended time of publication.    An article on fire prevention, for instance, is appropriate for the  month of October just before the day set aside for calling attention to  fires caused by carelessness. Months in advance, a writer might begin  collecting news stories of dangerous fires resulting from carelessness;  and from the annual report of the state fire marshal issued in July, he  could secure statistics on the causes of fires and the extent of the  losses.    To secure material for an article on the Christmas presents that  children might make at a cost of twenty-five cents or less, a woman  writer jotted down after one Christmas all the information that she  could get from her friends; and from these notes she wrote the article  early in the following summer. It was published in the November number  of a magazine, at a time when children were beginning to think about  making Christmas presents.    Articles on ways and means of earning college expenses are particularly  appropriate for publication in the summer or early fall, when young men  and women are preparing to go to college, but if in such an article a  student writer intends to describe experiences other than his own, he  may well begin gathering material from his fellow students some months  before.    Anniversaries of various events, such as important discoveries and  inventions, the death or birth of a personage, and significant  historical occasions, may also be anticipated. The fiftieth anniversary  of the arrival of the first railroad train in Kansas City was  commemorated in a special feature story in the _Kansas City Star_,  published the day before the anniversary. The day following the  fifty-sixth anniversary of the discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania,  the _New York Times_ printed in its Sunday magazine section a special  article on the man who first found oil there. The centenary of the  launching of the first steam-propelled ship to cross the Atlantic, was  commemorated by an article in the Sunday edition of the _Providence  Journal_. _Munsey's Magazine_ printed an article on the semi-centennial  of the discovery of the process of making paper from wood pulp.    By looking over tables giving dates of significant events, writers will  find what anniversaries are approaching; or they may glean such  information from news stories describing preparations made for  celebrating these anniversaries.    KEEPING LISTS OF SUBJECTS. Every writer who is on the lookout for  subjects and sources of material should keep a notebook constantly at  hand. Subjects suggested by everyday experiences, by newspaper and  magazine reading, and by a careful study of special articles in all  kinds of publications, are likely to be forgotten unless they are  recorded at once. A small notebook that can be carried in the pocket or  in a woman's hand-bag is most convenient. Besides topics for articles,  the titles of books, reports, bulletins, and other publications  mentioned in conversation or in newspapers, should be jotted down as  possible sources of material. Facts and figures from publications may  be copied for future use. Good titles and interesting methods of  treatment that a writer observes in the work of others may prove helpful  in suggesting titles and methods for his own articles. Separate sections  of even a small notebook may conveniently be set aside for all of these  various points.    FILING MATERIAL. The writer who makes methodical preparation for his  work generally has some system of filing good material so that it will  be at hand when he wants it. One excellent filing device that is both  inexpensive and capable of indefinite expansion consists of a number of  stout manilla envelopes, large enough to hold newspaper clippings,  printed reports, magazine articles, and photographs. In each envelope is  kept the material pertaining to one subject in which the writer is  interested, the character of the subject-matter being indicated on one  side of the envelope, so that, as the envelopes stand on end, their  contents can readily be determined. If a writer has many of these  envelopes, a one-drawer filing case will serve to keep them in good  order. By constantly gathering material from newspapers, magazines, and  printed reports, he will soon find that he has collected a considerable  amount of information on which to base his articles.          CHAPTER IV    APPEAL AND PURPOSE      ANALYZING THE SUBJECT. When from many available subjects a writer is  about to choose one, he should pause to consider its possibilities  before beginning to write. It is not enough to say, \"This is a good  subject; I believe that I can write an article on it.\" He needs to look  at the topic from every angle. He ought to ask himself, \"How widespread  is the interest in my subject? How much will it appeal to the average  individual? What phases of it are likely to have the greatest interest  for the greatest number of persons?\" To answer these questions he must  review the basic sources of pleasure and satisfaction.    WHAT INTERESTS READERS. To interest readers is obviously the prime  object in all popular writing. The basis of interest in the news story,  the special feature article, and the short story is essentially the  same. Whatever the average person likes to hear and see, whatever gives  him pleasure and satisfaction, is what he wants to read about. In order  to test all phases of a given subject from this point of view, a writer  needs to keep in mind the fundamental sources of satisfaction.    Subjects and phases of subjects that attract readers may, for  convenience, be divided into the following classes, which, however, are  not mutually exclusive: (1) timely topics, (2) unique, novel, and  extraordinary persons, things, and events, (3) mysteries, (4) romance,  (5) adventure, (6) contests for supremacy, (7) children, (8) animals,  (9) hobbies and amusements, (10) familiar persons, places, and objects,  (11) prominent persons, places, and objects, (12) matters involving the  life, property, and welfare of others, (13) matters that affect the  reader's own success and well-being.    Timeliness. Though not absolutely essential, timeliness is a valuable  attribute of any subject. Readers like to feel that they are getting the  latest facts and the newest ideas, in special feature articles as well  as in the news. A subject need not be discarded, however, because it  does not make a timely appeal. It may have interest in other respects  sufficiently great to compensate for its lack of timeliness.    Many topics that at first glance seem quite unrelated to current  activities are found on closer examination to have some aspects that may  be brought into connection with timely interests. To a writer keenly  alive to everything that is going on in the world, most subjects will be  found to have some bearing on what is uppermost in men's minds. Emphasis  on that point of contact with current ideas will give to the article the  desired timeliness.    NOVELTY. When a person, object, or circumstance is unique, it arouses an  unusual degree of interest. The first person to accomplish something out  of the ordinary, the first event of its kind, the first of anything,  arrests attention.    Closely associated with the unique is the extraordinary, the curious. If  not absolutely the only one of its kind, a thing may still be  sufficiently unusual to excite an uncommon degree of interest. Novelty  has a perennial charm. Careful study of a subject is often necessary to  reveal the novel and extraordinary phase of it that can best be  emphasized.    MYSTERIES. The fascination for the human mind of whatever baffles it is  so well known that it scarcely needs elaboration. Mysteries, whether  real or fictitious, pique curiosity. Even the scholar and the practical  man of affairs find relaxation in the mystery of the detective story.  Real life often furnishes events sufficiently mysterious to make a  special feature story that rivals fiction. Unexplained crimes and  accidents; strange psychical phenomena, such as ghosts, presentiments,  spiritism, and telepathy; baffling problems of the scientist and the  inventor--all have elements of mystery that fascinate the average  reader.    ROMANCE. The romance of real life is quite as interesting as that of  fiction. As all the world loves a lover, almost all the world loves a  love story. The course of true love may run smooth or it may not; in  either case there is the romantic appeal. To find the romantic element  in a topic is to discover a perennial source of attraction for all  classes of readers.    ADVENTURE. Few in number are the persons who will not gladly escape  from humdrum routine by losing themselves "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#9)"],[1,"she came back to circle round about this man, who seemingly took  no notice of her vagaries, not even when she reared just behind him,  pawing the air, nor when she lashed out at a humble _sayis_, missing  him by a hair; until, at last, overpowered by curiosity and love,  curveting, rearing, throwing her feet and making a frightful to-do over  nothing at all, she came close up--oh! very close--and whinnied gently.    With one hand clutching the silvery mane and in one bound he was across  the bare back and away with her into the desert, gripping her with his  knees, calling to her by every love-name he could think of.    And out there alone in the desert at the hour of prayer, he slipped  from her and, turning towards Mecca, raised his hands to heaven.    \"O God of the West!  O Allah of the East!  Give me one single hour of  love!\"    And the mare, Pi-Kay, wonderful in her beauty, raced from him far out  into the desert, leaving him alone with his God; then stood quite  still, with fine small ears pricked, waiting for the call she knew  would come.  And when it came ringing clear over the golden sand, she  raced back to him and pushed against him, until he sprang upon her and  turned her towards the East.    \"_By the war-horses_,\" he cried, quoting from Al-Koran, \"_which run  swiftly to battle, with a panting noise; and by those who strike fire  by dashing their hoofs against the stones; and by those who make a  sudden invasion on the enemy early in the morning and therein raise the  dust, and therein pass through the midst of the adverse troops_ . . . .  by the Message of the Great Book and by my love will I wrest one hour  from life.\"    And urging the mare with the whip of love to the uttermost of her  wonderful speed, he thundered back across the path of sand, which was  to be trodden by his feet alone, in spite of the plots which Zulannah  the courtesan was even then weaving about him--to her own advancement.          CHAPTER VII      \"_. . . . and she painted her face, and tired her    head, and looked out at a window_.\"              II KINGS.      The house of the \"Scarlet Enchantress,\" with its balconies, turrets and  outer and inner courts, stood quite by itself at one corner of the  Square, in a big, neglected garden.  It had been built by means of  untold gold and the destruction of scores of miserable, picturesque  hovels, which, poor as they might be, had however meant home to many of  the needy in the Arabian quarters of Cairo.  It would be useless to  look for that building covered in white plaster now; it was, later,  looted and burned to the ground.    A beautiful wanton of fourteen summers, ambitious, relentless, with the  eyes of an innocent child, the morals of a jackal and a fair supply of  brain-cunning rather than intellect, Zulannah sat this night of stars  in a corner of her balcony overlooking the Square, smoking endless  cigarettes.    Courtesan of the highest rank, she had plied her ruthless trade for  three successful years, accumulating incredible wealth in jewels and  hard cash.  Her ambition knew no bounds; her greed no limit; her  jealousy of other women had become a by-word in the north.    Physically she was perfect; otherwise, she had not one saving grace,  and her enemies were legion.  She had driven hard bargains, demanding  the very rings off men's fingers in exchange for kisses; shutting the  door with callous finality in the face of those she had beggared; she  had disowned her mother, who, stricken with ophthalmia, begged in the  streets; she had no mercy for man, woman or beast, yet all had gone  well until love had come to her.    Love comes to harlots and to queens as well as to us ordinary women,  and they suffer every whit as much as we do, perhaps more keenly on  account of the hopeless positions they fill.    It had come to Zulannah, uncontrollably, that night when, unveiled,  garbed in silks and satins and hung with jewels, she brazenly graced  the stage-box at a gala performance.    She looked down, and Ben Kelham, in the end seat of the first row of  stalls, looked up and looked and looked, seeing nothing, being blinded  with love of Damaris.    Zulannah drove back in her Rolls-Royce to the edge of the Arabian  quarter, where, owing to the narrowness of the lanes called by courtesy  streets, she alighted to finish what remained of the journey in a  litter swung from the shoulders of four Nubian slaves, and, arrived at  the great house, summoned her special bodyguard, Qatim the Ethiopian;  and for acquiring information down to the smallest detail about some  special individual there is, surely, no detective agency on earth to  compare to one ordinary, native servant.    He loves intrigue!    So that, twenty-four hours later, Zulannah laughed shrilly when Qatim  the Ethiopian repeated all he had learned of the white man and the  white maid he presumably loved.    \"Love!\" she scoffed.  \"He has not met _me_!\"    But in the weeks that followed no plot had succeeded, no device or  subtle invitation had lured the bird to the list, so that she beat  sharply upon a silver gong this night of the stars, upon which the  Ethiopian came running hastily to cast himself upon the ground at the  jewelled, henna'd feet.    \"Get up,\" she said, kicking him upon the side of the head; whereupon he  rose, chalking up one more mark on his own particular slate of Life,  upon one side of which was written Desire and the other Revenge.    He stood six-foot-four in his loin-cloth, as black and glistening as a  polished ebony statue.  The enormous hands at the end of great,  over-long arms almost touched his knees; the chest and shoulders and  abdomen were hard as iron, rippling with muscle under the oiled skin;  the feet were huge and pink of sole, and the animality of the man was  intensified by a certain gleam of intelligence somewhere in the  impassive negroid face.    The woman, took no notice of the magnificent physique; it neither  repulsed nor attracted her--he was a slave.    \"Run and give orders that no one is admitted!  Hasten!\"    \"Mistress, a great noble waits at-----\"    \"Desirest thou thy tongue split, thou black dog, that thou answerest  Zulannah?  Haste thee, and return!\"    And far into the night they talked, those two, planning death or  destruction, anything as long as it attained the desire of the woman  who, looking into the future, took no notice of the mountain of  disaster beside her in the shape of the Ethiopian who desired and hated  her with all the bestial passion of his race.    Then, just as far down in the east the sky lightened, she sat suddenly  upright and clapped her jewelled hands.    \"Know'st thou the eunuch who guards the harem empty of women in the  palace of--ah! the barbarity of the name!--E'u Car-r-den Ali?  He who  perchance would give one-half, nay, all of his great wealth in return  for the coal-blackness of thy odorous skin.  There is to be held a big  entertainment within the walls of the white man's hotel, and soon.  An  entertainment where the whites dance foolishly in foolish raiment,  disguised as that which they are not and with covered faces.  What  easier than for me to obtain entry as one of them under my veils and  have speech with the man I love?  And if he is as thou sayest, besotted  with love of this white girl, then will I use the man of barbarous name  as a tool to bring about that which I desire.  Know'st thou the eunuch?\"    \"Mistress, he is my twin-brother.\"    \"Twin of _thee_!  Behold, did not thy mother die of fright, at sight of  such monstrosities?\"    \"Nay, mistress, there are six sons younger than thy slave, each one of  which could break thee in one hand.\"    Zulannah sprang to her feet and, seizing a short whip from a table,  smote the man again and again until his face ran blood.    \"Thou vile brute, darest thou so to speak!  Behold, this is but a  foretaste of what will befall thy black carcase before the hour is  spent.\"    \"Call thy slaves, mistress; split my tongue; whip the soles from off my  feet, the flesh from my body, even to the bones, and thou shalt never  meet my twin-brother, who even now prepareth the great palace for the  coming of the\"--he spat--\"bird of different-coloured plumage.\"    And Zulannah, understanding that she must not overstep the limit if she  desired to attain her end, flung the whip full into the stolid,  indifferent face, and fled, raving obscenities, into the house.          CHAPTER VIII      \"_If God in His wisdom have brought close    The day when I must die,    That day by water or fire or air    My feet shall fall in the destined snare    Wherever my road may lie_.\"              DANTE GABRIEL ROSETTI      \"May I come in?  Oh, Maris, what _do_ you think?  There is to be a real  native fortune-teller in the Winter Garden.  They've made the corner  near the fountain like an Arab's tent, and he'll tell us our horoscopes  in the sand, and all sorts of things.\"    \"Not forgetting the stars, let us hope?\"    \"Oh, there's sure to be that.\"    Damaris laughed as she turned in her chair and looked at the excited  little visitor in fancy-dress.    \"You _do_ look sweet.  A Light of the Harem, for certain.\"    \"Yes; and what do you think?  There are three dozen Lights.  Isn't it a  shame?  I thought I should be the only one.  And there are two and a  half dozen Sheikhs, and I don't know how many dozen Bedouins.  You  are--what are you?  You look awfully--awfully--er--I don't quite know  what.\"    Damaris adjusted the _selva_, the quaint silver kind of tube between  the eyebrows which connects the yashmak and the _tarhah_ or head-veil,  took a final look in the mirror, and rose.    \"I am an Egyptian woman of the humblest class.\"    She was all in black, as befits a member of that class.  The simple  bodice, cut in a yoke, of the black muslin dress fitted her like a  glove; the skirt fell in wide folds from the waist and swung about her  ankles encircled by big brass rings, which"]]]
