Crowd on the athletic opportunities,  the mental arithmetic, the verse-learning, the drawing, the botany, or  what not, the moment you have reason to think the hour is ripe. The hour  may not last long, and while it continues you may safely let all the  child's other occupations take a second place. In this way you economize  time and deepen skill; for many an infant prodigy, artistic or  mathematical, has a flowering epoch of but a few months.    One can draw no specific rules for all this. It depends on close  observation in the particular case, and parents here have a great  advantage over teachers. In fact, the law of transitoriness has little  chance of individualized application in the schools.    Such is the little interested and impulsive psychophysical organism  whose springs of action the teacher must divine, and to whose ways he  must become accustomed. He must start with the native tendencies, and  enlarge the pupil's entire passive and active experience. He must ply  him with new objects and stimuli, and make him taste the fruits of his  behavior, so that now that whole context of remembered experience is  what shall determine his conduct when he gets the stimulus, and not the  bare immediate impression. As the pupil's life thus enlarges, it gets  fuller and fuller of all sorts of memories and associations and  substitutions; but the eye accustomed to psychological analysis will  discern, underneath it all, the outlines of our simple psychophysical  scheme.    Respect then, I beg you, always the original reactions, even when you  are seeking to overcome their connection with certain objects, and to  supplant them with others that you wish to make the rule. Bad behavior,  from the point of view of the teacher's art, is as good a starting-point  as good behavior. In fact, paradoxical as it may sound to say so, it is  often a better starting-point than good behavior would be.    The acquired reactions must be made habitual whenever they are  appropriate. Therefore Habit is the next subject to which your attention  is invited.          VIII. THE LAWS OF HABIT      It is very important that teachers should realize the importance of  habit, and psychology helps us greatly at this point. We speak, it is  true, of good habits and of bad habits; but, when people use the word  'habit,' in the majority of instances it is a bad habit which they  have in mind. They talk of the smoking-habit and the swearing-habit  and the drinking-habit, but not of the abstention-habit or the  moderation-habit or the courage-habit. But the fact is that our  virtues are habits as much as our vices. All our life, so far as it  has definite form, is but a mass of habits,--practical, emotional, and  intellectual,--systematically organized for our weal or woe, and  bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.    Since pupils can understand this at a comparatively early age, and since  to understand it contributes in no small measure to their feeling of  responsibility, it would be well if the teacher were able himself to  talk to them of the philosophy of habit in some such abstract terms as I  am now about to talk of it to you.    I believe that we are subject to the law of habit in consequence of the  fact that we have bodies. The plasticity of the living matter of our  nervous system, in short, is the reason why we do a thing with  difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and  finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with  hardly any consciousness at all. Our nervous systems have (in Dr.  Carpenter's words) _grown_ to the way in which they have been exercised,  just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to  fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.    Habit is thus a second nature, or rather, as the Duke of Wellington  said, it is 'ten times nature,'--at any rate as regards its importance  in adult life; for the acquired habits of our training have by that time  inhibited or strangled most of the natural impulsive tendencies which  were originally there. Ninety-nine hundredths or, possibly, nine hundred  and ninety-nine thousandths of our activity is purely automatic and  habitual, from our rising in the morning to our lying down each night.  Our dressing and undressing, our eating and drinking, our greetings and  partings, our hat-raisings and giving way for ladies to precede, nay,  even most of the forms of our common speech, are things of a type so  fixed by repetition as almost to be classed as reflex actions. To each  sort of impression we have an automatic, ready-made response. My very  words to you now are an example of what I mean; for having already  lectured upon habit and printed a chapter about it in a book, and read  the latter when in print, I find my tongue inevitably falling into its  old phrases and repeating almost literally what I said before.    So far as we are thus mere bundles of habit, we are stereotyped  creatures, imitators and copiers of our past selves. And since this,  under any circumstances, is what we always tend to become, it follows  first of all that the teacher's prime concern should be to ingrain into  the pupil that assortment of habits that shall be most useful to him  throughout life. Education is for behavior, and habits are the stuff of  which behavior consists.    To quote my earlier book directly, the great thing in all education is  to _make our nervous system our ally instead of our enemy_. It is to  fund and capitalize our acquisitions, and live at ease upon the  interest of the fund. _For this we must make automatic and habitual, as  early as possible, as many useful actions as we can_, and as carefully  guard against the growing into ways that are likely to be  disadvantageous. The more of the details of our daily life we can hand  over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers  of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more  miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but  indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of  every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the  beginning of every bit of work are subjects of express volitional  deliberation. Full half the time of such a man goes to the deciding or  regretting of matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as  practically not to exist for his consciousness at all. If there be such  daily duties not yet ingrained in any one of my hearers, let him begin  this very hour to set the matter right.    In Professor Bain's chapter on 'The Moral Habits' there are some  admirable practical remarks laid down. Two great maxims emerge from the  treatment. The first is that in the acquisition of a new habit, or the  leaving off of an old one, we must take care to _launch ourselves with  as strong and decided an initiative as possible_. Accumulate all the  possible circumstances which shall reinforce the right motives; put  yourself assiduously in conditions that encourage the new way; make  engagements incompatible with the old; take a public pledge, if the case  allows; in short, envelope your resolution with every aid you know. This  will give your new beginning such a momentum that the temptation to  break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise might; and every day  during which a breakdown is postponed adds to the chances of its not  occurring at all.    I remember long ago reading in an Austrian paper the advertisement of a  certain Rudolph Somebody, who promised fifty gulden reward to any one  who after that date should find him at the wine-shop of Ambrosius  So-and-so. 'This I do,' the advertisement continued, 'in consequence of  a promise which I have made my wife.' With such a wife, and such an  understanding of the way in which to start new habits, it would be safe  to stake one's money on Rudolph's ultimate success.    The second maxim is, _Never suffer an exception to occur till the new  habit is securely rooted in your life_. Each lapse is like the letting  fall of a ball of string which one is carefully winding up: a single  slip undoes more than a great many turns will wind again. Continuity of  training is the great means of making the nervous system act infallibly  right. As Professor Bain says:--    \"The peculiarity of the moral habits, contradistinguishing them from the  intellectual acquisitions, is the presence of two hostile powers, one to  be gradually raised into the ascendant over the other. It is necessary  above all things, in such a situation, never to lose a battle. Every  gain on the wrong side undoes the effect of many conquests on the right.  The essential precaution, therefore, is so to regulate the two opposing  powers that the one may have a series of uninterrupted successes, until  repetition has fortified it to such a degree as to enable it to cope  with the opposition, under any circumstances. This is the theoretically  best career of mental progress.\"    A third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: _Seize the very first  possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every  emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits  you aspire to gain._ It is not in the moment of their forming, but in  the moment of their producing motor effects, that resolves and  aspirations communicate the new 'set' to the brain.    No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no matter  how good one's sentiments may be, if one have not taken advantage of  every concrete opportunity to act, one's character may remain entirely  unaffected for the better. With good intentions, hell proverbially is  paved. This is an obvious consequence of the principles I have laid  down. A 'character,' as J.S. Mill says, 'is a completely fashioned  will'; and a will, in the sense in which he means it, is an aggregate of  tendencies to act in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#9)"],[1," not.    Notes:    [Footnote 1: The only 'sectarian' feature of the Sri-bhashya is, that  identifies Brahman with Vish/n/u or Naraya/n/a; but this in no way  affects the interpretations put on the Sutras and Upanishads. Naraya/n/a  is in fact nothing but another name of Brahman.]    [Footnote 2: The Roman numerals indicate the number of the adhikara/n/a;  the figures in parentheses state the Sutras comprised in each  adhikara/n/a.]    [Footnote 3: Deussen's supposition (pp. 30, 150) that the passage  conveying the second interpretation is an interpolation is liable to two  objections. In the first place, the passage is accepted and explained by  all commentators; in the second place, /S/a@nkara in the passage  immediately preceding Sutra 12 quotes the adhikara/n/a 'anandamayo s  bhyasat' as giving rise to a discussion whether the param or the aparam  brahman is meant. Now this latter point is not touched upon at all in  that part of the bhashya which sets forth the former explanation, but  only in the subsequent passage, which refutes the former and advocates  the latter interpretation.]    [Footnote 4: Eva/m/ jij/n/anasya brahma/nas/  /ko/tanabhogvabhutaga/d/arupsattvara, istamomayapradhanad vyav/ri/ttir  ukta, idani/m/ karmava/s/vat trigu/n/atmakaprik/ri/u  sa/m/sangammittanamavidhan intadukhasagaranimajjaoni/s/addha/h/. /k/i  pratya gaumano nyan nikhilaheyapratauika/m/ miatimyanandam brahmeti  pratipadyate, anandamayo bhyasat.]    [Footnote 5: There is no reason to consider the passage 'atra ke/k/it'  in /S/a@nkara's bhashya on Sutra 23 an interpolation as Deussen does (p.  30). It simply contains a criticism passed by /S/a@nkara on other  commentators.]    [Footnote 6: To the passages on pp. 150 and 153 of the Sanskrit text,  which Deussen thinks to be interpolations, there likewise applies the  remark made in the preceding note.]    [Footnote 7: Givaysa iva parasyapi brahma/n/a/h/ /s/arirantarvaititvam  abhyupagata/m/ /k/et tadvad eva  /s/arirasainbandhaprayuktasukhadukhopabhogapraptir hi /k/en na,  hetuvai/s/eshyat, na hi /s/arirantarvartitvam eva  sukhadukhopabhogahetu/h/ api tu pu/n/yapaparnpakarmaparavasatva/m/ ta/k/  /K/apahatapapmana/h/ parahatmano na sambhavati.]    [Footnote 8: The second interpretation given on pp. 184-5 of the  Sanskrit text (beginning with apara aha) Deussen considers to be an  interpolation, caused by the reference to the Paingi upanishad in  /S/a@nkara's comment on I, 3, 7 (p. 232). But there is no reason  whatsoever for such an assumption. The passage on p. 232 shows that  /S/a@nkara considered the explanation of the mantra given in the  Paingi-upanishad worth quoting, and is in fact fully intelligible only  in case of its having been quoted before by /S/a@nkara himself.--That  the 'apara' quotes the B/ri/hadara/n/yaka not according to the Ka/n/va  text--to quote from which is /S/a@nkara's habit--but from the  Madhyandina text, is due just to the circumstance of his being an  'apara,' i.e. not /S/a@nkara.]    [Footnote 9: Ita/s/ /k/aitad evam.

The first adhyaya has proved that all the Vedanta-texts unanimously  teach that there is only one cause of the world, viz. Brahman, whose  nature is intelligence, and that there exists no scriptural passage  which can be used to establish systems opposed to the Vedanta, more  especially the Sa@nkhya system. The task of the two first padas of the  second adhyaya is to rebut any objections which may be raised against  the Vedanta doctrine on purely speculative grounds, apart from  scriptural authority, and to show, again on purely speculative grounds,  that none of the systems irreconcilable with the Vedanta can be  satisfactorily established.      PADA I.      Adhikara/n/a I refutes the Sa@nkhya objection that the acceptation of  the Vedanta system involves the rejection of the Sa@nkhya doctrine which  after all constitutes a part of Sm/ri/ti, and as such has claims on  consideration.--To accept the Sa@nkhya-sm/ri/ti, the Vedantin replies,  would compel us to reject other Sm/ri/tis, such as the Manu-sm/ri/ti,  which are opposed to the Sa@nkhya doctrine. The conflicting claims of  Sm/ri/tis can be settled only on the ground of the Veda, and there can  be no doubt that the Veda does not confirm the Sa@nkhya-sm/ri/ti, but  rather those Sm/ri/tis which teach the origination of the world from an  intelligent primary cause.    Adhik. II (3) extends the same line of argumentation to the  Yoga-sm/ri/ti.    Adhik. III (4-11) shows that Brahman, although of the nature of  intelligence, yet may be the cause of the non-intelligent material  world, and that it is not contaminated by the qualities of the world  when the latter is refunded into Brahman. For ordinary experience  teaches us that like does not always spring from like, and that the  qualities of effected things when the latter are refunded into their  causes--as when golden ornaments, for instance, are melted and thereby  become simple gold again--do not continue to exist in those  causes.--Here also the argumentation is specially directed against the  Sa@nkhyas, who, in order to account for the materiality and the various  imperfections of the world, think it necessary to assume a causal  substance participating in the same characteristics.    Adhik. IV (12) points out that the line of reasoning followed in the  preceding adhikara/n/a is valid also against other theories, such as the  atomistic doctrine.    The one Sutra (13) constituting Adhik. V teaches, according to  /S/a@nkara, that although the enjoying souls as well as the objects of  fruition are in reality nothing but Brahman, and on that account  identical, yet the two sets may practically be held apart, just as in  ordinary life we hold apart, and distinguish as separate individual  things, the waves, ripples, and foam of the sea, although at the bottom  waves, ripples, and foam are all of them identical as being neither more  nor less than sea-water.--The /S/ri-bhashya gives a totally different  interpretation of the Sutra, according to which the latter has nothing  whatever to do with the eventual non-distinction of enjoying souls and  objects to be enjoyed. Translated according to Ramanuja's view, the  Sutra runs as follows: 'If non-distinction (of the Lord and the  individual souls) is said to result from the circumstance of (the Lord  himself) becoming an enjoyer (a soul), we refute this objection by  instances from every-day experience.' That is to say: If it be  maintained that from our doctrine previously expounded, according to  which this world springs from the Lord and constitutes his body, it  follows that the Lord, as an embodied being, is not essentially  different from other souls, and subject to fruition as they are; we  reply that the Lord's having a body does not involve his being subject  to fruition, not any more than in ordinary life a king, although himself  an embodied being, is affected by the experiences of pleasure and pain  which his servants have to undergo.--The construction which Ramanuja  puts on the Sutra is not repugnant either to the words of the Sutra or  to the context in which the latter stands, and that it rests on earlier  authority appears from a quotation made by Ramanuja from the  Drami/d/abhashyakara[13].    Adhik. VI (14-20) treats of the non-difference of the effect from the  cause; a Vedanta doctrine which is defended by its adherents against the  Vai/s/eshikas according to whom the effect is something different from  the cause.--The divergent views of /S/a@nkara and Ramanuja on this  important point have been sufficiently illustrated in the general sketch  of the two systems.    Adhik. VII (21-23) refutes the objection that, from the Vedic passages  insisting on the identity of the Lord and the individual soul, it  follows that the Lord must be like the individual soul the cause of  evil, and that hence the entire doctrine of an all-powerful and all-wise  Lord being the cause of the world has to be"]]]
