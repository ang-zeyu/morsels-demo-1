No one can be here without being reminded of the all pervading  presence of the great \"Father of all.\"        \"What, but God, pervades, adjusts and agitates the whole!\"    Not far from the point at which the avenue assumes the rugged  features, which now characterize it, we separated from our guide, he  continuing his straight-forward course, and we descending gradually a  few feet and entering a tunnel of fifteen feet wide on our left, the  ceiling twelve or fourteen feet high, perfectly arched and beautifully  covered with white incrustations, very soon reached the Great  Crossings. Here the guide jumped down some six or eight feet from the  avenue which we had left, into the tunnel where we were standing, and  crossing it, climbed up into the avenue, which he pursued for a short  distance or until it united with the tunnel, where he again joined us.  In separating from, then crossing, and again uniting with the avenue,  it describes with it something like the figure 8. The name, Great  Crossings, is not unapt. It was however, not given, as our intelligent  guide veritably assured us, in honor of the Great Crossings where the  man lives who killed Tecumseh, but because two great caves cross here;  and moreover said he, \"the valiant Colonel ought to change the name of  his place, as no two places in a State should bear the same name, and  this being the _great_ place ought to have the preference.\"    Not very far from this point, we ascended a hill on our left, and  walking a short distance over our shoe-tops in dry nitrous earth, in a  direction somewhat at a right angle with the avenue below, we arrived  at the Pine Apple Bush, a large column, composed of a white, soft,  crumbling material, with bifurcations extending from the floor to the  ceiling. At a short distance, either to the right or left, you have a  fine view of the avenue some twenty feet below, both up and down. Why  this crumbling stalactite is called the Pine Apple Bush, I cannot  divine. It stands however in a charming, secluded spot, inviting to  repose; and we luxuriated in inhaling the all-inspiring air, while  reclining on the clean, soft and dry salt petre earth.    All lovers of romantic scenery ought to visit this avenue, and all  dyspeptic hypochondriacs and love-sick despondents should do likewise,  for there is something wonderfully exhilarating in the air of Pensico.  Our friend B. remarked while rolling on the salt petre earth at the  Pine Apple Bush, that he felt \"especially happy,\" and whether from  sympathy, air or what not, we all partook of the same feeling. The  guide seeing the position of our fat friend, and hearing his remark,  said, laughing most immoderately, \"these sort of feelings would come  over one, now and then in the Cave, but wait till you get in the  Winding Way and see how you feel then.\"    Having descended into the avenue we had left, we passed a number of  stalactites and stalagmites, bearing a remarkable resemblance to  coral, and a hundred or more paces beyond, arrived at a recess on the  left, lined with innumerable crystals of dog-tooth spar, shining most  brilliantly, called Angelica's Grotto. One would think it almost  sacrilege to deface a spot like this; yet, did a Clergyman (the back  of the guide being turned,) deliberately demolish a number of  beautiful crystals to inscribe the initials of his name.    Returning to the head of Pensico Avenue, we turned to our right, and  entered the narrow pass which leads to the river, pursuing which, for  a few hundred yards, descending all the while, at one or two places  down a ladder or stone steps, we came to a path cut through a high and  broad embankment of sand, which very soon conducted us to the much  talked of and anxiously looked for Winding Way. The Winding Way, has,  in the opinion of many, been channeled in the rock by the gradual  attrition of water. If this be so, and appearances seem to support  such belief, at what early age of the world did the work commence? Was  it not when \"the earth was without form and void,\" thousands of years  perhaps, before the date of the Mosaic account of the Creation? The  Winding Way is one hundred and five feet long, eighteen inches wide,  and from three to seven feet deep, widening out above, sufficiently to  admit the free use of one's arms. It is throughout tortuous, a perfect  _zig-zag_, the terror of the Falstaffs and the ladies of \"fat, fair  and forty,\" who have an instinctive dread of the trials to come, and  are well aware of the merriment that their efforts to _force a  passage_ will excite among their companions of less length of girdle.  Into this winding way, we entered in Indian file, and turning our  right side, then our left, twisting this way, then that, had nearly  made good the passage, when our _fat friend_, who was puffing and  blowing behind us like a high pressure engine, cried out, \"Halt, ahead  there! I am stuck as tight as a wedge in a log!\" Halt we did, when the  guide, looking at our friend, who was in truth \"wedg'd in the rocky  way and sticking fast,\" cried out, \"I told you, when you said at the  Pine Apple Bush, that you felt _especially happy_, to wait till you  got to the Winding Way, to see how you would feel then!\" The  imprisoned gentleman soon burst his bonds, not, however, without  damage to his indispensables; and at length forcing his way into  Relief Hall, he cried out, in the joy of his heart, while stretching  himself and wiping the perspiration from his jolly, rubicund face,  \"never was a name more appropriate given to any place--Relief. I feel  already the _expansive faculty_ of the atmosphere, I can now breathe  again.\"    Relief Hall, which you enter from the Winding Way, at a right-angle,  is very wide and lofty but not long; turning to the right, we reached  its termination at River Hall, a distance of perhaps, one hundred  yards. Here two routes present themselves; the one to the left  conducts to the Dead Sea and the Rivers, and that to the right, to the  Bacon Chamber, the Bandit's Hall, the Mammoth Dome and an infinity of  other caves, domes, etc. We will speak of the Bacon Chamber; but  before doing so, let us take our lunch. The air or exercise, or  probably both, acted as powerful appetizers, and we soon gave proof  that we needed not Stoughton's bitters to provoke an appetite. Having  discussed a few glasses of excellent Hock, we left the Bacon Chamber,  which is a pretty fair representation of a low ceiling, thickly hung  with canvassed hams and shoulders; and proceeded to the Bandit's Hall,  up a steep ascent of twenty or thirty feet, rendered very difficult,  by the huge rocks which obstructed the way and over which we were  forced to clamber. The name is indicative of the spot. It is a vast  and lofty chamber, the floor covered with a mountainous heap of rocks  rising amphitheatrically almost to the ceiling, and so disposed as to  furnish at different elevations, galleries or platforms, reaching  immediately around the chamber itself or leading off into some of its  hidden recesses. The guide is presently seen standing at a fearful  height above, and suddenly a Bengal light, blazes up, \"when the rugged  roof, the frowning cliffs and the whole chaos of rocks are refulgent  in the brilliant glare.\" The sublimity of the scene is beyond the  powers of the imagination.          CHAPTER VIII.    Mammoth Dome--First Discoverers--Little Dome--Tale of a Lamp--Return.      From the Bandit's Hall, diverge two caves; one of which, the left,  leads you to a multitude of domes; and the right, to one which, _par  excellence_, is called the Mammoth Dome. Taking the right, we arrived,  after a rugged walk of nearly a mile, to a platform, which commands an  indistinct view of this dome of domes. It was discovered by a German  gentleman and the guide Stephen about two years ago, but was not  explored until some months after, when it was visited by a party of  four or five, accompanied by two guides, and well prepared with ropes,  &c. From the platform, the guides were let down about twenty feet, by  means of a rope, and upon reaching the ground below, they found  themselves on the side of a hill, which, descending about fifty feet,  brought them immediately under the Great Dome, from the summit of  which, there is a water-fall. This dome is near four hundred feet  high, and is justly considered one of the most sublime and wonderful  spectacles of this most wonderful of caverns. From the bottom of the  dome they ascended the hill to the place to which they had been  lowered from the platform, and continuing thence up a very steep hill,  more than one hundred feet, they reached its summit. Arrived at the  summit, a scene of awful grandeur and magnificence is presented to the  view. Looking down the declivity, you see far below to the left, the  visiters whom you have left behind, standing on the platform or  termination of the avenue along which they had come; and lower down  still, the bottom of the Great Dome itself. Above, two hundred and  eighty feet, is the ceiling, lost in the obscurity of space and  distance. The height of the ceiling was determined by E.F. Lee, civil  engineer. This fact in regard to the elevation of the ceiling and the  locality of the Great Hall, was subsequently ascertained, by finding  on the summit of the hill, (a spot never before trodden by man,) an  iron lamp!! The astonishment of the guides, as well as of the whole  party, on beholding the lamp, can be easily imagined; and to this day  they would have been ignorant of its history, but for the accidental  circumstance of an old man being at the Cave Hotel, who, thirty years  ago, was engaged as a miner in the saltpetre establishment of Wilkins  & Gratz. He, on being shown the lamp, said at once, that it had been  found under"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#9)"],[1,"depth or breadth) covered with boats and vessels in motion: the voice of  commerce, and the stir of industry, cheering and animating you as you  approach the town. I was told that almost every vessel which I saw (some of  them of two hundred, and even of three hundred tons burthen) was filled  with brandy and wine. The lamps are suspended from the centre of long  ropes, across the road; and the whole scene is of a truly novel and  imposing character. But how shall I convey to you an idea of what I  experienced, as, turning to the left, and leaving the broader streets which  flank the quay, I began to enter the _penetralia_ of this truly antiquated  town? What narrow streets, what overhanging houses, what bizarre,  capricious ornaments! What a mixture of modern with ancient art! What  fragments, or rather ruins, of old delicately-built Gothic churches! What  signs of former and of modern devastation! What fountains, gutters, groups  of never-ceasing men, women, and children, all gay, all occupied, and all  apparently happy! The _Rue de la Grosse Horloge_ (so called from a huge,  clumsy, antiquated clock which goes across it) struck me as being not among  the least singular streets of Rouen. In five minutes I was within the  court-yard of the _Hotel Vatel_, the favourite residence of the English.    It was evening when I arrived, in company with three Englishmen. We were  soon saluted by the _laquais de place_--the leech-like hangers-on of every  hotel--who begged to know if we would walk upon the Boulevards. We  consented; turned to the right; and, gradually rising, gained a  considerable eminence. Again we turned to the right, walking upon a raised  promenade; while the blossoms of the pear and apple trees, within a hundred  walled gardens, perfumed the air with a delicious fragrance. As we  continued our route along the _Boulevard Beauvoisine_, we gained one of the  most interesting and commanding views imaginable of the city of Rouen--just  at that moment lighted up by the golden rays of a glorious sun-set--which  gave a breadth and a mellower tone to the shadows upon the Cathedral and  the Abbey of St. Ouen. The situation of Rouen renders it necessarily  picturesque, view it from what spot you will.    The population of Rouen is supposed to be full one hundred thousand souls.  In truth, there is no end to the succession of human beings. They swarm  like bees, and like bees are busy in bringing home the produce of their  industry. You have all the bustle and agitation of Cheapside and Cornhill;  only that the ever-moving scene is carried on within limits one-half as  broad. Conceive Bucklersbury, Cannon-street, and Thames-street,--and yet  you cannot conceive the narrow streets of Rouen: filled with the flaunting  cauchoise, and echoing to the eternal tramp of the sabot. There they are;  men, women, and children--all abroad in the very centre of the streets:  alternately encountering the splashing of the gutter, and the jostling of  their townsmen--while the swift cabriolet, or the slow-paced cart, or the  thundering _Diligence_, severs them, and scatters them abroad, only that  they may seem to be yet more condensely united. For myself, it is with  difficulty I believe that I am not living in the times of our Henry VIII.  and of their Francis I.; and am half disposed to inquire after the  residence of _Guillaume Tailleur_ the printer--the associate, or foreign  agent of your favourite _Pynson_.[35]      [34] [Mons. Licquet here observes, \"This is the first time I have heard it      said that our Postilions put on rouge.\" What he adds, shall be given      in his own pithy expression.--\"Ou la coquetterie va-t-elle se nicher?\"      What, however is above stated, was stated from a _conviction_ of      its being TRUE]    [35] [The third English Printer.] See the _Bibliographical Decameron_,      vol. ii. p. 137, 8.          LETTER V.    ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE. CATHEDRAL. MONUMENTS. RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES.  THE ABBEY OF ST. OUEN. THE CHURCHES OF ST. MACLOU, ST. VINCENT, ST. VIVIEN,  ST. GERVAIS, AND ST. PAUL.      I have now made myself pretty well acquainted with the geography of Rouen.  How shall I convey to you a summary, and yet a satisfactory, description of  it? It cannot be done. You love old churches, old books, and relics of  ancient art. These be my themes, therefore: so fancy yourself either  strolling leisurely with me, arm in arm, in the streets--or sitting at my  elbow. First for THE CATHEDRAL:--for what traveller of taste does not doff  his bonnet to the _Mother Church_ of the town through which he happens to  be travelling--or in which he takes up a temporary abode? The  west-front,[36] always the _forte_ of the architect's skill, strikes you as  you go down, or come up, the principal street--_La Rue des Carmes_,--which  seems to bisect the town into equal parts. A small open space, (which  however has been miserably encroached upon by petty shops) called the  _Flower-garden_, is before this western front; so that it has some little  breathing room in which to expand its beauties to the wondering eyes of the  beholder. In my poor judgment, this western front has very few elevations  comparable with it[37]--including even those of _Lincoln_ and _York_. The  ornaments, especially upon the three porches, between the two towers, are  numerous, rich, and for the greater part entire:--in spite of the  Calvinists,[38] the French revolution, and time. Among the lower and  smaller basso-relievos upon these porches, is the subject of the daughter  of Herodias dancing before Herod. She is manoeuvering on her hands, her  feet being upwards. To the right, the decapitation of St. John is taking  place.    The southern transept makes amends for the defects of the northern. The  space before it is devoted to a sort of vegetable market: curious old  houses encircle this space: and the ascent to the door, but more especially  the curiously sculptured porch itself, with the open spaces in the upper  part--light, fanciful and striking to a degree--produce an effect as  pleasing as it is extraordinary. Add to this, the ever-restless feet of  devotees, going in and coming out--the worn pavement, and the frittered  ornaments, in consequence--seem to convince you that the ardour and  activity of devotion is almost equal to that of business.[39]    As you enter the cathedral, at the centre door, by descending two steps,  you are struck with the length and loftiness of the nave, and with the  lightness of the gallery which runs along the upper part of it. Perhaps the  nave is too narrow for its length. The lantern of the central large tower  is beautifully light and striking. It is supported by four massive  clustered pillars, about forty feet in circumference;[40] but on casting  your eye downwards, you are shocked at the tasteless division of the choir  from the nave by what is called a _Grecian screen_: and the interior of the  transepts has undergone a like preposterous restoration. The rose windows  of the transepts, and that at the west end of the nave, merit your  attention and commendation. I could not avoid noticing, to the right, upon  entrance, perhaps the oldest side chapel in the cathedral: of a date,  little less ancient than that of the northern tower; and perhaps of the end  of the twelfth century. It contains by much the finest specimens of stained  glass--of the early part of the XVIth century. There is also some beautiful  stained glass on each side of the Chapel of the Virgin,[41] behind the  choir; but although very ancient, it is the less interesting, as not being  composed of groups, or of historical subjects. Yet, in this, as in almost  all the churches which I have seen, frightful devastations have been made  among the stained-glass windows by the fury of the Revolutionists.[42]    Respecting the MONUMENTS, you ought to know that the famous ROLLO lies in  one of the side-chapels, farther down to the right, upon entering; although  his monument cannot be older than the thirteenth century. My attachment to  the bibliomanical celebrity of JOHN, DUKE OF BEDFORD, will naturally lead  me to the notice of his interment and monumental inscription. The latter is  thus;        _Ad dextrum Altaris Latus_        _Jacet_        IOANNES DUX BETFORDI        _Normanniae pro Rex_        _Obiit Anno_        MCCCCXXXV.    The Duke's tomb will be seen engraved in Sandford's Genealogical  History,[43] p. 314; which plate, in fact, is the identical one used by  Ducarel; who had the singularly good fortune to decorate his Anglo-Norman  Antiquities without any expense to himself![44]    There is a curious chapter in Pommeraye's _Histoire de l'Eglise Cathedrale  de Rouen_, p. 203, respecting the Duke's taking the habit of a canon of the  cathedral. He attended, with his first wife, ANNE OF BURGUNDY, and threw  himself upon the liberality and kindness of the monks, to be received by  them as one of their order: \"il les prioit d'etre receu parmy eux comme un  de leurs freres, et d'avoir tous les jours distribution de pain et de vin,  et pour marque de fraternite d'etre vetu du surplis et de l'aumusse: comme  aussi d'etre associe, luy et sa tres genereuse et tres illustre epouse, aux  suffrages de leur compagnie, et a la participation de tous les biens qu'il  plaira a Dieu leur donner la grace d'operer,\" p. 204. A grand procession  marked the day of the Duke's admission into the monkish fraternity. The  whole of this, with an account of the Duke's superb presents to the  sacristy, his dining with his Duchess, and receiving their portion of  \"eight loaves and four gallons of wine,\" are distinctly narrated by the  minute Pommeraye.    As you approach the _Chapel of the Virgin_, you pass by an ancient  monument, to the left, of a recumbent Bishop, reposing behind a thin  pillar, within a pretty ornamented Gothic arch.[45] To the eye of a  tasteful antiquary this cannot fail to have its due attraction.
