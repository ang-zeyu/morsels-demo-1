He shows with cruel frankness, with a strange love  of modern character, the strong legs, the thin shoulders, and the  provoking and vulgar heads of these frequently ugly girls of common  origin. With the irony of an entomologist piercing the coloured insect  he shows us the disenchanting reality in the sad shadow of the scenes,  of these butterflies who dazzle us on the stage. He unveils the reverse  side of a dream without, however, caricaturing; he raises even, under  the imperfection of the bodies, the animal grace of the organisms; he  has the severe beauty of the true. He gives to his groups of  ballet-dancers the charming line of garlands and restores to them a  harmony in the _ensemble_, so as to prove that he does not misjudge the  charm conferred upon them by rhythm, however defective they may be  individually. At other times he devotes himself to the study of their  practice. In bare rooms with curtainless windows, in the cold and sad  light of the boxes, he passionately draws the dancers learning their  steps, reaching high bars with the tips of their toes, forcing  themselves into quaint poses in order to make themselves more supple,  manoeuvring to the sound of a fiddle scratched by an old teacher--and he  leaves us stupefied at the knowledge, the observation, the talent  profusely spent on these little pictures. Furthermore there are humorous  scenes: ballet-dancers chatting in the dark with _habitues_ of the  Opera, others looking at the house through the small opening of the  curtain, others re-tying their shoe-laces, and they all are prodigious  drawings of movement anatomically as correct as they are unexpected.  Degas's old style of drawing undergoes modification: with the help of  slight deformations, accentuations of the modelling and subtle  falsifications of the proportions, managed with infinite tact and  knowledge, the artist brings forth in relief the important gesture,  subordinating to it all the others. He attempts _drawing by movement_ as  it is caught by our eyes in life, where they do not state the  proportions, but first of all the gesture which strikes them. In these  drawings by Degas all the lines follow the impulsion of the thought.  What one sees first, is the movement transmitted to the members by the  will. The active part of the body is more carefully studied than the  rest, which is indicated by bold foreshortenings, placed in the second  plane, and apparently only serves to throw into relief the raised arm or  leg. This is no longer merely _exact_, it is _true_; it is a superior  degree of truth.    [Illustration: DEGAS    THE DANCERS]    These pictures of dancers are psychologic documents of great value. The  physical and moral atmosphere of these surroundings is called forth by a  master. Such and such a figure or attitude tells us more about Parisian  life than a whole novel, and Degas has been lavish of his intellect and  his philosophy of bitter scepticism. But they are also marvellous  pictorial studies which, in spite of the special, anecdotal subjects,  rise to the level of grand painting through sheer power of  draughtsmanship and charm of tone. Degas has the special quality of  giving the precise sensation of the third dimension. The atmosphere  circulates round his figures; you walk round them; you see them in their  real plane, and they present themselves in a thousand unexpected  arrangements. Degas is undoubtedly the one man of his age who has most  contributed towards infusing new life into the representation of human  figures: in this respect his pictures resemble no one else's. The same  qualities will be found in his series of women bathing. These interiors,  where the actions of the bathers are caught amidst the stuffs, flowered  cushions, linen, sponges and tubs, are sharp visions of modernity. Degas  observes here, with the tenacious perfection of his talent, the  slightest shiver of the flesh refreshed by cold water. His masterly  drawing follows the most delicate inflexion of the muscles and suggests  the nervous system under the skin. He observes with extraordinary  subtlety the awkwardness of the nude being at a time when nudity is no  longer accustomed to show itself, and this true nudity is in strong  contrast to that of the academicians. One might say of Degas that he has  the disease of truth, if the necessity of truth were not health itself!  These bodies are still marked with the impressions of the garments; the  movements remain those of a clothed being which is only nude as an  exception. The painter notices beauty, but he looks for it particularly  in the profound characterisation of the types which he studies, and his  pastels have the massiveness and the sombre style of bronze. He has also  painted cafe-scenes, prostitutes and supers, with a mocking and sad  energy; he has even amused himself with painting washerwomen, to  translate the movements of the women of the people. And his colour with  its pearly whites, subdued blues and delicate greys, always elevates  everything he does, and confers upon him a distinctive style.    Finally, about 1896, Degas has revealed himself as a dreamy landscapist.  His recent landscapes are symphonies in colours of strange harmony and  hallucinations of rare tones, resembling music rather than painting. It  is perhaps in these pictures that he has revealed certain dreams  hitherto jealously hidden.    And now I must speak of his technique. It is very singular and varied,  and one of the most complicated in existence. In his first works, which  are apparently as simple as Corot's, he does not employ the process of  colour-spots. But many of the works in his second manner are a  combination of drawing, painting and pastel. He has invented a kind of  engraving mixed with wash-drawing, pastel crayon crushed with brushes of  special pattern. Here one can find again his meticulous spirit. He has  many of the qualities of the scientist; he is as much chemist as  painter. It has been said of him, that he was a great artist of the  decadence. This is materially inexact, since his qualities of  draughtsmanship are those of a superb Classicist, and his colouring of  very pure taste. But the spirit of his work, his love of exact detail,  his exaggerated psychological refinement, are certainly the signs of an  extremely alert intellect who regards life prosaically and with a  lassitude and disenchantment which are only consoled by the passion for  truth. Certain water-colours of his heightened by pastel, and certain  landscapes, are somewhat disconcerting through the preciousness of his  method; others are surprisingly spontaneous. All his work has an  undercurrent of thought. In short, this Realist is almost a mystic. He  has observed a limited section of humanity, but what he has seen has not  been seen so profoundly by anybody else.    [Illustration: DEGAS    HORSES IN THE MEADOWS]    Degas has exercised an occult, but very serious, influence. He has lived  alone, without pupils and almost without friends; the only pupils one  might speak of are the caricaturist Forain, who has painted many small  pictures inspired by him, and the excellent American lady-artist Miss  Mary Cassatt. But all modern draughtsmen have been taught a lesson by  his painting: Renouard, Toulouse-Lautrec and Steinlen have been  impressed by it, and the young generation considers Degas as a master.  And that is also the unexpressed idea of the academicians, and  especially of those who have sufficient talent to be able to appreciate  all the science and power of such an art. The writer of this book  happened one day to mention Degas's name before a member of the  Institute. \"What!\" exclaimed he, \"you know him? Why didn't you speak to  me about him?\" And when he received the reply, that I did not consider  Degas to be an agreeable topic for him, the illustrious official  answered vivaciously, \"But do you think I am a fool, and that I do not  know that Degas is one of the greatest draughtsmen who have ever  lived?\"--\"Why, then, my dear sir, has he never been received at the  Salons, and not even been decorated at the age of sixty-five?\"--\"Ah,\"  replied the Academician a little angrily, \"that is another matter!\"    Degas despises glory. It is believed that he has by him a number of  canvases which will have to be burnt after his death in accordance with  his will. He is a man who has loved his art like a mistress, with  jealous passion, and has sacrificed to it all that other  artists--enthusiasts even--are accustomed to reserve for their personal  interest. Degas, the incomparable pastellist, the faultless draughtsman,  the bitter, satirical, pessimistic genius, is an isolated phenomenon in  his period, a grand creator, unattached to his time. The painters and  the select few among art-lovers know what considerable force there is in  him. Though almost latent as yet, it will reveal itself brilliantly,  when an opportunity arises for bringing together the vast quantity of  his work. As is the case with Manet, though in a different sense, his  powerful classic qualities will become most prominent in this ordeal,  and this classicism has never abandoned him in his audacities. To Degas  is due a new method of observation in drawing. He will have been the  first to study the relation between the moving lines of a living being  and the immovable lines of the scene which serves as its setting; the  first, also, to define drawing, not as a graphic science, but as the  valuation of the third dimension, and thus to apply to painting the  principles hitherto reserved for sculpture. Finally, he will be counted  among the great analysts. His vision, tenacious, intense, and sombre,  stimulates thought: across what appears to be the most immediate and  even the most vulgar reality it reaches a grand,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#9)"],[1,"Frensham and the Irish squabble  generally into anything better than idiotic mischief, that for a time he  was unusually silent--wrestling with the problem, and Mr. Direck got the  conversational initiative.    \"To an American mind it's a little--startling,\" said Mr. Direck, \"to  hear ladies expressing such vigorous political opinions.\"    \"I don't mind that,\" said Mr. Britling. \"Women over here go into  politics and into public-houses--I don't see why they shouldn't. If such  things are good enough for men they are good enough for women; we  haven't your sort of chivalry. But it's the peculiar malignant silliness  of this sort of Toryism that's so discreditable. It's discreditable.  There's no good in denying it. Those people you have heard and seen are  a not unfair sample of our governing class--of a certain section of our  governing class--as it is to-day. Not at all unfair. And you see how  amazingly they haven't got hold of anything. There was a time when they  could be politic.... Hidden away they have politic instincts even  now.... But it makes me sick to think of this Irish business. Because,  you know, it's true--we _are_ drifting towards civil war there.\"    \"You are of that opinion?\" said Mr. Direck.    \"Well, isn't it so? Here's all this Ulster gun-running--you heard how  she talked of it? Isn't it enough to drive the south into open  revolt?...\"    \"Is there very much, do you think, in the suggestion that some of this  Ulster trouble is a German intrigue? You and Mr. Philbert were saying  things--\"    \"I don't know,\" said Mr. Britling shortly.    \"I don't know,\" he repeated. \"But it isn't because I don't think our  Unionists and their opponents aren't foolish enough for anything of the  sort. It's only because I don't believe that the Germans are so stupid  as to do such things.... Why should they?...    \"It makes me--expressionless with anger,\" said Mr. Britling after a  pause, reverting to his main annoyance. \"They won't consider any  compromise. It's sheer love of quarrelling.... Those people there think  that nothing can possibly happen. They are like children in a nursery  playing at rebellion. Unscathed and heedless. Until there is death at  their feet they will never realise they are playing with loaded  guns....\"    For a time he said no more; and listened perfunctorily while Mr. Direck  tried to indicate the feeling in New England towards the Irish Question  and the many difficult propositions an American politician has to face  in that respect. And when Mr. Britling took up the thread of speech  again it had little or no relation to Mr. Direck's observations.    \"The psychology of all this recent insubordination and violence  is--curious. Exasperating too.... I don't quite grasp it.... It's the  same thing whether you look at the suffrage business or the labour  people or at this Irish muddle. People may be too safe. You see we live  at the end of a series of secure generations in which none of the great  things of life have changed materially. We've grown up with no sense of  danger--that is to say, with no sense of responsibility. None of us,  none of us--for though I talk my actions belie me--really believe that  life can change very fundamentally any more forever. All this\",--Mr.  Britling waved his arm comprehensively--\"looks as though it was bound to  go on steadily forever. It seems incredible that the system could be  smashed. It seems incredible that anything we can do will ever smash the  system. Lady Homartyn, for example, is incapable of believing that she  won't always be able to have week-end parties at Claverings, and that  the letters and the tea won't come to her bedside in the morning. Or if  her imagination goes to the point of supposing that some day _she_ won't  be there to receive the tea, it means merely that she supposes somebody  else will be. Her pleasant butler may fear to lose his 'situation,' but  nothing on earth could make him imagine a time when there will not be a  'situation' for him to lose. Old Asquith thinks that we always have got  along, and that we always shall get along by being quietly artful and  saying, 'Wait and see.' And it's just because we are all convinced that  we are so safe against a general breakdown that we are able to be so  recklessly violent in our special cases. Why shouldn't women have the  vote? they argue. What does it matter? And bang goes a bomb in  Westminster Abbey. Why shouldn't Ulster create an impossible position?  And off trots some demented Carsonite to Germany to play at treason on  some half word of the German Emperor's and buy half a million rifles....    \"Exactly like children being very, very naughty....    \"And,\" said Mr. Britling with a gesture to round off his discourse, \"we  do go on. We shall go on--until there is a spark right into the  magazine. We have lost any belief we ever had that fundamental things  happen. We are everlasting children in an everlasting nursery....\"    And immediately he broke out again.    \"The truth of the matter is that hardly any one has ever yet mastered  the fact that the world is round. The world is round--like an orange.  The thing is told us--like any old scandal--at school. For all  practical purposes we forget it. Practically we all live in a world as  flat as a pancake. Where time never ends and nothing changes. Who really  believes in any world outside the circle of the horizon? Here we are and  visibly nothing is changing. And so we go on to--nothing will ever  change. It just goes on--in space, in time. If we could realise that  round world beyond, then indeed we should go circumspectly.... If the  world were like a whispering gallery, what whispers might we not hear  now--from India, from Africa, from Germany, warnings from the past,  intimations of the future....    \"We shouldn't heed them....\"      Section 6    And indeed at the very moment when Mr. Britling was saying these words,  in Sarajevo in Bosnia, where the hour was somewhat later, men whispered  together, and one held nervously to a black parcel that had been given  him and nodded as they repeated his instructions, a black parcel with  certain unstable chemicals and a curious arrangement of detonators  therein, a black parcel destined ultimately to shatter nearly every  landmark of Mr. Britling's and Lady Frensham's cosmogony....      Section 7    When Mr. Direck and Mr. Britling returned to the Dower House the guest  was handed over to Mrs. Britling and Mr. Britling vanished, to reappear  at supper time, for the Britlings had a supper in the evening instead of  dinner. When Mr. Britling did reappear every trace of his vexation with  the levities of British politics and the British ruling class had  vanished altogether, and he was no longer thinking of all that might be  happening in Germany or India....    While he was out of the way Mr. Direck extended his acquaintance with  the Britling household. He was taken round the garden and shown the  roses by Mrs. Britling, and beyond the rose garden in a little arbour  they came upon Miss Corner reading a book. She looked very grave and  pretty reading a book. Mr. Direck came to a pause in front of her, and  Mrs. Britling stopped beside him. The young lady looked up and smiled.    \"The last new novel?\" asked Mr. Direck pleasantly.    \"Campanella's 'City of the Sun.'\"    \"My word! but isn't that stiff reading?\"    \"You haven't read it,\" said Miss Corner.    \"It's a dry old book anyhow.\"    \"It's no good pretending you have,\" she said, and there Mr. Direck felt  the conversation had to end.    \"That's a very pleasant young lady to have about,\" he said to Mrs.  Britling as they went on towards the barn court.    \"She's all at loose ends,\" said Mrs. Britling. \"And she reads like  a--Whatever does read? One drinks like a fish. One eats like a wolf.\"    They found the German tutor in a little court playing Badminton with the  two younger boys. He was a plump young man with glasses and compact  gestures; the game progressed chiefly by misses and the score was  counted in German. He won thoughtfully and chiefly through the ardour of  the younger brother, whose enthusiastic returns invariably went out.  Instantly the boys attacked Mrs. Britling with a concerted enthusiasm.  \"Mummy! Is it to be dressing-up supper?\"    Mrs. Britling considered, and it was manifest that Mr. Direck was  material to her answer.    \"We wrap ourselves up in curtains and bright things instead of  dressing,\" she explained. \"We have a sort of wardrobe of fancy dresses.  Do you mind?\"    Mr. Direck was delighted.    And this being settled, the two small boys went off with their mother  upon some special decorative project they had conceived and Mr. Direck  was left for a time to Herr Heinrich.    Herr Heinrich suggested a stroll in the rose garden, and as Mr. Direck  had not hitherto been shown the rose garden by Herr Heinrich, he agreed.  Sooner or later everybody, it was evident, had got to show him that rose  garden.    \"And how do you like living in an English household?\" said Mr. Direck,  getting to business at once. \"It's interesting to an American to see  this English establishment, and it must be still more interesting to a  German.\"    \"I find it very different from Pomerania,\" said Herr Heinrich. \"In some  respects it is more agreeable, in others less so. It is a pleasant life  but it is not a serious life.    \"At any time,\" continued Herr Heinrich, \"some one may say, 'Let us do  this thing,' or 'Let us do that thing,' and then everything is  disarranged.    \"People walk into the house without ceremony. There is much kindness but  no politeness. Mr. Britling will go away for three or four days, and  when he returns and I come forward to greet him and bow, he will walk  right past me, or he will say just like this, 'How do, Heinrich?'\"    \"Are you interested in Mr. Britling's writings?\" Mr. Direck asked.    \"There again I am puzzled.
