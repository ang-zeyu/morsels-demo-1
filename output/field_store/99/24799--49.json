The bows are made of split bamboo; and so strong, that no man  in the ship could bend one of them. The string is a broad slip of cane,  fixed to one end of the bow; and fitted with a noose, to go over the  other end, when strung. The arrow is a cane of about four feet long, into  which a pointed piece of the hard, heavy, _casuarina_ wood, is firmly and  neatly fitted; and some of them were barbed. Their clubs are made of the  _casuarina_, and are powerful weapons. The hand part is indented, and has  a small knob, by which the firmness of the grasp is much assisted; and  the heavy end is usually carved with some device: One had the form of a  parrot's head, with a ruff round the neck; and was not ill done.    Their canoes are about fifty feet in length, and appear to have been  hollowed out of a single tree; but the pieces which form the gunwales,  are planks sewed on with the fibres of the cocoa nut, and secured with  pegs. These vessels are low, forward, but rise abaft; and, being narrow,  are fitted with an outrigger on each side, to keep them steady. A raft,  of greater breadth than the canoe, extends over about half the length;  and upon this is fixed a shed or hut, thatched with palm leaves. These  people, in short, appeared to be dextrous sailors and formidable  warriors; and to be as much at ease in the water, as in their canoes.    Sept. 7. The boats having found deep water round the north end of the  three low islands, the vessels followed them; but anchored again, soon  after noon, in latitude 9 deg. 31', and longitude 143 deg. 31'; being sheltered  by the two western islands, named _Stephens'_ and _Campbell's_, and the  reefs which surround them. There were then no less than eight islands in  sight, at different distances; though none further to the westward than  W. S. W. All these, except Darnley's Island, first seen, were small, low,  and sandy; but generally well covered with wood in the central parts.    On the 8th, the vessels steered westward, with the usual precautions. No  land, or other obstruction, had been seen in that quarter; but, at ten  o'clock, they were forced to haul the wind to the southward, their course  being impeded by reefs; upon one of which, was _Pearce's_ sandy _Key_. At  noon, they had anchored in 15 fathoms, under the lee of _Dalrymple's  Island_, the westernmost before seen; but two other islands were then  visible in the S. by W.; and reefs extended from N.4 deg., to S. 55 deg. W., at  the distance of three or four miles. The latitude here was 9 deg. 37'; and  longitude, from six sets of distances of the sun and moon, 143 deg. 31'; but,  by the time-keepers, 143 deg. 15' east.    Several canoes were lying upon the shore of Dalrymple's Island; but no  natives could he distinguished from the ships. When the boats returned,  however, from sounding, in the afternoon, they came out upon the beach;  waving green branches and clapping upon their heads, in token of  friendship. Boats were afterwards sent to them, and were amicably  received; the natives running into the water to meet them, and some  getting into one of the boats. They eagerly asked for _toore-tooree_; and  gave in exchange some ornaments of shells, and a kind of plum somewhat  resembling a _jambo_. When the boats pushed off from the shore, the  natives followed into the water, and appeared anxious to detain them; but  offered no violence. A moderately-sized dog, of a brown, chestnut colour,  was observed amongst the party.    Sept. 9. The vessels steered after the boats, between the cluster of  islands to the southward, and an extensive reef to the west; with  soundings from 15 to 10 fathoms. At noon, the latitude was 9 deg. 48',  longitude by timekeepers 143 deg. 6'; and two other islands came in sight to  the westward. Before two o'clock, an extensive reef, partly dry, to which  the name of _Dungeness_ was given, made it necessary to heave to, until  the boats had time to sound; after which, captain Bligh bore away along  the north side of the reef, and anchored a mile from it, in 17 fathoms,  hard bottom. In this situation, _Dungeness Island_, which is low and very  woody, bore N. 64 deg. to 87 deg. W. three miles; and a small sandy isle, named  _Warriours Island_, N. 6 deg. to 1 deg. W. four miles: this last appeared to  stand upon the great western reef, and was surrounded with dry sands.  Besides these, there were other low isles, called the _Six Sisters_, in  sight, to the south-east; and a long, flat island, bearing S. 33 deg. to 46 deg.  W. over the dry Dungeness Reef; in the west, also, there were islands  visible, at a greater distance, and much higher, than the others. The  Strait, instead of becoming clearer, seemed to be more and more  embarrassed with dangers, as the vessels proceeded westward. The latitude  of this anchorage was 9 deg. 501/2' south, and the longitude 142 deg. 55' east.    Sept. 10. The boats sounded the channel to the north-west, between  Dungeness and Warriours Islands; and finding sufficient water, the  vessels got under way, at noon, to follow them. There were many natives  collected upon the shore of Dungeness Island, and several canoes from  Warriours Island were about the brig. Presently, captain Portlock made  the signal for assistance; and there was a discharge of musketry and some  guns, from his vessel and from the boats. Canoes were also coming towards  the Providence; and when a musket was fired at the headmost, the natives  set up a great shout, and paddled forward in a body; nor was musketry  sufficient to make them desist. The second great gun, loaded with round  and grape, was directed at the foremost of eight canoes, full of men; and  the round shot, after raking the whole length, struck the high stem. The  Indians leaped out, and swam towards their companions; plunging  constantly, to avoid the musket balls which showered thickly about them.  The squadron then made off, as fast as the people could paddle without  showing themselves; but afterwards rallied at a greater distance, until a  shot, which passed over their heads, made them disperse, and give up all  idea of any further attack.    In passing the deserted canoe, one native was observed still sitting in  it. The other canoes afterwards returned to him; and, with glasses,  signals were perceived to be made by the Indians, to their friends on  Dungeness Island, expressive, as was thought, of grief and consternation.    No arrows fell on board the Providence; but three men were wounded in the  Assistant, and one of them afterwards died: The depth to which the arrows  penetrated into the decks and sides of the brig, was represented to be  truly astonishing.    The vessels passed between Dungeness and Warriours Islands, with from 19  to 13 fathoms; and anchored, at four o'clock, under the lee of Dungeness  Island and Reef. The passage to the westward then appeared clearer; three  high islands, bearing from S. 60 deg. W. three leagues, to N. 76 deg. W. five  leagues, forming the sole visible obstructions.    Sept. 11. Captain Bligh proceeded on his course to the W. N. W., and  passed two islands, to which the descriptive names of _Turtle-backed  Island_ and the _Cap_ were given; and, soon after noon, the vessels  anchored in 7 fathoms, soft bottom. There was a dry sand bearing N. 63 deg.  W. two or three miles; between which, and the third high island, called  _The Brothers_, bearing S. 55 deg. to 69 deg. W. three miles, it was judged  necessary for the boats to sound, before proceeding further. This  anchorage was in latitude 9 deg. 43', and longitude 142 deg. 40'; and, besides  the islands already mentioned, there was in sight a mountainous island,  to which the name of _Banks_ was given, bearing S. 43 deg. W., twelve or  thirteen leagues; also _Burke's Island_, S. 13 deg. W. eight or ten leagues;  and _Mount Cornwallis_, on another island, N. 29 deg. W. six or eight  leagues; and from behind this last, to N. 7 deg. W., there extended a level  land, which was supposed to be a part of the coast of NEW GUINEA.    Sept. 12. The vessels followed the boats to the westward; but were  interrupted by reefs, and obliged to anchor again before noon. The water  had shoaled gradually, and there was then only 6 fathoms: the bottom a  coarse, coral sand. Two other islands were then in sight: a low one,  named _Turn-again Island_, bore N. 53 deg. W. about four leagues; and  _Jervis' Island_, which is rather high, S. 48 deg. W. nine leagues. A reef,  with a dry sand upon it, extended from S. 7 deg. E. to 62 deg. W. four or five  miles; another was distant three miles to the west; and a third bore N.  18 deg. W. five miles. The latitude of the anchorage was 9 deg. 41' south, and  longitude 142 deg. 24' east.    A fresh gale from south-east did not allow the Providence and Assistant  to proceed onward for three days. In the mean time, the passage between  the reefs to the N. W., was sounded by the boats; and found to contain  about 5 fathoms, regularly, upon hard ground. They were also sent to  examine the passage round the southern reefs; and this being deeper, with  a superior bottom, it was chosen as the preferable route.    Sept. 16. The vessels passed to windward of the southern reef; and  steered south-westward, as it trended, in from 7 to 5 fathoms water,  until half past noon; when they anchored in latitude 10 deg. 3', and  longitude, by time-keeper, 142 deg. 14'. The sole direction in which the eye  could range without being obstructed, was that whence the vessels had  come; every where else the view was arrested by rocks, banks, and  islands. The most extensive of these, was Banks' Island, extending from  S. 14 deg. E. to 62 deg. W., two or three leagues; with a high hill upon it named  _Mount Augustus_, which bore S. 4 deg. E:* Another large island, named  _Mulgrave's_, extended from behind the last to a cluster of rocks, whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12956"],[0,"A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"a, owing to the mistaken accent of a single word the object  was reversed and the demon produced was killed by Indra. But if  the sacrifice could be duly performed down to the minutest  detail, there was no power which could arrest or delay the fruition  of the object. Thus the objects of a sacrifice were fulfilled not  by the grace of the gods, but as a natural result of the sacrifice.  The performance of the rituals invariably produced certain  mystic or magical results by virtue of which the object desired    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: See _S.B.E._ XLIII. pp.59,60,400 and XLIV. p.409.]    [Footnote 2: See _Ibid_., XLIV, p. 418.]    [Footnote 3: R.V.x.90, Puru@sa Sukta.]    22    by the sacrificer was fulfilled in due course like the fulfilment of  a natural law in the physical world. The sacrifice was believed  to have existed from eternity like the Vedas. The creation of  the world itself was even regarded as the fruit of a sacrifice performed  by the supreme Being. It exists as Haug says \"as an invisible thing at  all times and is like the latent power of electricity in an  electrifying machine, requiring only the operation of a suitable  apparatus in order to be elicited.\" The sacrifice is not offered  to a god with a view to propitiate him or to obtain from him welfare  on earth or bliss in Heaven; these rewards are directly produced by  the sacrifice itself through the correct performance of complicated  and interconnected ceremonies which constitute the sacrifice. Though  in each sacrifice certain gods were invoked and received the offerings,  the gods themselves were but instruments in bringing about the sacrifice  or in completing the course of mystical ceremonies composing it.  Sacrifice is thus regarded as possessing a mystical potency superior even  to the gods, who it is sometimes stated attained to their divine rank  by means of sacrifice. Sacrifice was regarded as almost the only  kind of duty, and it was also called _karma_ or _kriya_ (action) and  the unalterable law was, that these mystical ceremonies for good  or for bad, moral or immoral (for there were many kinds of  sacrifices which were performed for injuring one's enemies or  gaining worldly prosperity or supremacy at the cost of others)  were destined to produce their effects. It is well to note here that  the first recognition of a cosmic order or law prevailing in nature  under the guardianship of the highest gods is to be found in the  use of the word @Rta (literally the course of things). This word  was also used, as Macdonell observes, to denote the \"'order'  in the moral world as truth and 'right' and in the religious  world as sacrifice or 'rite'[Footnote ref 1]\" and its unalterable law of  producing effects. It is interesting to note in this connection that it  is here that we find the first germs of the law of karma, which exercises  such a dominating control over Indian thought up to the present  day. Thus we find the simple faith and devotion of the Vedic  hymns on one hand being supplanted by the growth of a complex  system of sacrificial rites, and on the other bending their course  towards a monotheistic or philosophic knowledge of the ultimate  reality of the universe.    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 11.]    23      Cosmogony--Mythological and philosophical.    The cosmogony of the @Rg-Veda may be looked at from two  aspects, the mythological and the philosophical. The mythological  aspect has in general two currents, as Professor Macdonell says,  \"The one regards the universe as the result of mechanical production,  the work of carpenter's and joiner's skill; the other  represents it as the result of natural generation [Footnote ref. 1].\"  Thus in the @Rg-Veda we find that the poet in one place says, \"what was  the wood and what was the tree out of which they built heaven  and earth [Footnote ref. 2]?\" The answer given to this question in  Taittiriya-Brahma@na is \"Brahman the wood and Brahman the tree from  which the heaven and earth were made [Footnote ref 3].\" Heaven and Earth  are sometimes described as having been supported with posts [Footnote  ref 4]. They are also sometimes spoken of as universal parents, and  parentage is sometimes attributed to Aditi and Dak@sa.    Under this philosophical aspect the semi-pantheistic Man-hymn  [Footnote ref 5] attracts our notice. The supreme man as we have already  noticed above is there said to be the whole universe, whatever  has been and shall be; he is the lord of immortality who has become  diffused everywhere among things animate and inanimate, and  all beings came out of him; from his navel came the atmosphere;  from his head arose the sky; from his feet came the earth; from  his ear the four quarters. Again there are other hymns in which  the Sun is called the soul (_atman_) of all that is movable and  all that is immovable [Footnote ref 6]. There are also statements to the  effect that the Being is one, though it is called by many names by the  sages [Footnote ref 7]. The supreme being is sometimes extolled as the  supreme Lord of the world called the golden egg (Hira@nyagarbha [Footnote  ref 8]). In some passages it is said \"Brahma@naspati blew forth these  births like a blacksmith. In the earliest age of the gods, the existent  sprang from the non-existent. In the first age of the gods, the  existent sprang from the non-existent: thereafter the regions  sprang, thereafter, from Uttanapada [Footnote ref 9].\" The most remarkable  and sublime hymn in which the first germs of philosophic speculation    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 11.]    [Footnote 2: R.V.x. 81. 4.]    [Footnote 3: Taitt. Br. II. 8. 9. 6.]    [Footnote 4: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 11; also R.V. II. 15 and IV.  56.]    [Footnote 5: R.V.x. 90.]    [Footnote 6: R.V.I. 115.]    [Footnote 7: R.V.I. 164. 46.]    [Footnote 8: R.V.X. 121.]    [Footnote 9: Muir's translation of R.V.x. 72; Muir's _Sanskrit Texts_, vol.  v.p. 48.]    24    with regard to the wonderful mystery of the origin of the world  are found is the 129th hymn of R.V.x.    1. Then there was neither being nor not-being.     The atmosphere was not, nor sky above it.     What covered all? and where? by what protected?     Was there the fathomless abyss of waters?    2. Then neither death nor deathless existed;     Of day and night there was yet no distinction.     Alone that one breathed calmly, self-supported,     Other than It was none, nor aught above It.    3. Darkness there was at first in darkness hidden;     The universe was undistinguished water.     That which in void and emptiness lay hidden     Alone by power of fervor was developed.    4. Then for the first time there arose desire,     Which was the primal germ of mind, within it.     And sages, searching in their heart, discovered     In Nothing the connecting bond of Being.    6. Who is it knows? Who here can tell us surely     From what and how this universe has risen?     And whether not till after it the gods lived?     Who then can know from what it has arisen?    7. The source from which this universe has risen,     And whether it was made, or uncreated,     He only knows, who from the highest heaven     Rules, the all-seeing lord--or does not He know [Footnote ref 1]?    The earliest commentary on this is probably a passage in the  S'atapatha Brahma@na (x. 5. 3.I) which says that \"in the beginning  this (universe) was as it were neither non-existent nor existent;  in the beginning this (universe) was as it were, existed and did  not exist: there was then only that Mind. Wherefore it has been  declared by the Rishi (@Rg-Veda X. 129. I), 'There was then neither  the non-existent nor the existent' for Mind was, as it were, neither  existent nor non-existent. This Mind when created, wished to  become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after  a self (a body); it practised austerity: it acquired consistency [Footnote  ref 2].\" In the Atharva-Veda also we find it stated that all forms of  the universe were comprehended within the god Skambha [Footnote ref 3].    Thus we find that even in the period of the Vedas there sprang  forth such a philosophic yearning, at least among some who could    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 90. R.V.x. 129.]    [Footnote 2: See Eggeling's translation of _S'.B., S.B.E._ vol. XLIII. pp.  374, 375.]    [Footnote 3: _A.V._ x. 7. 10.]    25    question whether this universe was at all a creation or not, which  could think of the origin of the world as being enveloped in the  mystery of a primal non-differentiation of being and non-being;  and which could think that it was the primal One which by its  inherent fervour gave rise to the desire of a creation as the first  manifestation of the germ of mind, from which the universe sprang  forth through a series of mysterious gradual processes. In the  Brahma@nas, however, we find that the cosmogonic view generally  requires the agency of a creator, who is not however always the  starting point, and we find that the theory of evolution is combined  with the theory of creation, so that Prajapati is sometimes  spoken of as the creator while at other times the creator is said  to have floated in the primeval water as a cosmic golden egg.      Eschatology; the Doctrine of Atman.    There seems to be a belief in the Vedas that the soul could  be separated from the body in states of swoon, and that it could  exist after death, though we do not find there any trace of the  doctrine of transmigration in a developed form. In the S'atapatha  Brahma@na it is said that those who do not perform rites with  correct knowledge are born again after death and suffer death  again. In a hymn"]]]
