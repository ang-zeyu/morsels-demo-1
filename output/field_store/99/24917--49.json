Her fame as a poetess was at once established upon the publication of her  \"Poems\" in 1863; since which time several other volumes have appeared. The  most generally admired of her poems are \"Songs of Seven\" and \"The High  Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire,\" She has also written several  successful novels, of which, \"Off the Skelligs\" is the most popular.  \"Stories Told to a Child,\" \"The Cumberers,\" \"Poor Mat,\" \"Studies for  Stories,\" and \"Mopsa, the Fairy\" are also well known. Miss Ingelow resided  in London, England, and spent much of her time in deeds of charity.    1. A nightingale made a mistake;       She sang a few notes out of tune:     Her heart was ready to break,       And she hid away from the moon.     She wrung her claws, poor thing,       But was far too proud to weep;     She tucked her head under her wing,       And pretended to be asleep.    2. A lark, arm in arm with a thrush,       Came sauntering up to the place;     The nightingale felt herself blush,       Though feathers hid her face;     She knew they had heard her song,       She felt them snicker and sneer;     She thought that life was too long,       And wished she could skip a year.    3. \"O nightingale!\" cooed a dove;       \"O nightingale! what's the use?     You bird of beauty and love,       Why behave like a goose?     Don't sulk away from our sight,       Like a common, contemptible fowl;     You bird of joy and delight,       Why behave like an owl?    4. \"Only think of all you have done;       Only think of all you can do;     A false note is really fun       From such a bird as you!     Lift up your proud little crest,       Open your musical beak;     Other birds have to do their best,       You need only to speak!\"    6. The nightingale shyly took       Her head from under her wing,     And, giving the dove a look,       Straightway began to sing.     There was never a bird could pass;       The night was divinely calm;     And the people stood on the grass       To hear that wonderful psalm.    6. The nightingale did not care,       She only sang to the skies;     Her song ascended there,       And there she fixed her eyes.     The people that stood below       She knew but little about;     And this tale has a moral, I know,       If you'll try and find it out.      DEFINITIONS.--2. Saun'ter-ing, wandering idly, strolling. Snick'er, to  laugh in a half-suppressed manner. 4. Crest, a tuft growing on an animal's  head. 5. Di-vine'ly, in a supreme degree. 6. Mor'al, the practical lesson  which anything is fitted to teach.    NOTE.--The nightingale is a small bird, about six inches in length, with a  coat of dark-brown feathers above and of grayish, white beneath. Its voice  is astonishingly strong and sweet, and, when wild, it usually sings  throughout the evening and night from April to the middle of summer. The  bird is common in Europe, but is not found in America.        VII. DO NOT MEDDLE.    1. About twenty years ago there lived a singular gentleman in the Old Hall  among the elm trees. He was about three-score years of age, very rich, and  somewhat odd in many of his habits, but for generosity and benevolence he  had no equal.    2. No poor cottager stood in need of comforts, which he was not ready to  supply; no sick man or woman languished for want of his assistance; and  not even a beggar, unless a known impostor, went empty-handed from the  Hall. Like the village pastor described in Goldsmith's poem of \"The  Deserted Village,\"      \"His house was known to all the vagrant train;    He chid their wand'rings, but relieved their pain;    The long-remembered beggar was his guest,    Whose beard descending swept his aged breast.\"    3. Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted a boy to wait upon him at  table, and to attend him in different ways, for he was very fond of young  people. But much as he liked the society of the young, he had a great  aversion to that curiosity in which many young people are apt to indulge.  He used to say, \"The boy who will peep into a drawer will be tempted to  take something out of it; and he who will steal a penny in his youth will  steal a pound in his manhood.\"    4. No sooner was it known that the old gentleman was in want of a boy than  twenty applications were made for the situation; but he determined not to  engage anyone until he had in some way ascertained that he did not possess  a curious, prying disposition.    5. On Monday morning seven lads, dressed in their Sunday clothes, with  bright and happy faces, made their appearance at the Hall, each of them  desiring to obtain the situation. Now the old gentleman, being of a  singular disposition had prepared a room in such a way that he might  easily know if any of the young people who applied were given to meddle  unnecessarily with things around them, or to peep into cupboards and  drawers. He took care that the lads who were then at Elm Tree Hall should  be shown into this room one after another.    6. And first, Charles Brown was sent into the room, and told that he would  have to wait a little. So Charles sat down on a chair near the door. For  some time he was very quiet, and looked about him; but there seemed to be  so many curious things in the room that at last he got up to peep at  them.    7. On the table was placed a dish cover, and Charles wanted sadly to know  what was under it, but he felt afraid of lifting it up. Bad habits are  strong things; and, as Charles was of a curious disposition, he could not  withstand the temptation of taking one peep. So he lifted up the cover.    8. This turned out to be a sad affair; for under the dish cover was a heap  of very light feathers; part of the feathers, drawn up by a current of  air, flew about the room, and Charles, in his fright, putting the cover  down hastily, puffed the rest of them off the table.    9. What was to be done? Charles began to pick up the feathers one by one;  but the old gentleman, who was in an adjoining room, hearing a scuffle,  and guessing the cause of it, entered the room, to the consternation of  Charles Brown, who was very soon dismissed as a boy who had not principle  enough to resist even a slight temptation.    10. When the room was once more arranged, Henry Wilkins was placed there  until such time as he should be sent for. No sooner was he left to himself  than his attention was attracted by a plate of fine, ripe cherries. Now  Henry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and he thought it would be  impossible to miss one cherry among so many. He looked and longed, and  longed and looked, for some time, and just as he had got off his seat to  take one, he heard, as he thought, a foot coming to the door; but no, it  was a false alarm.    11. Taking fresh courage, he went cautiously and took a very fine cherry,  for he was determined to take but one, and put it into his mouth. It was  excellent; and then he persuaded himself that he ran no risk in taking  another; this he did, and hastily popped it into his mouth.    12. Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artificial cherries at the top  of the others, filled with Cayenne pepper; one of these Henry had  unfortunately taken, and it made his month smart and burn most  intolerably. The old gentleman heard him coughing, and knew very well what  was the matter. The boy that would take what did not belong to him, if no  more than a cherry, was not the boy for him. Henry Wilkins was sent about  his business without delay, with his mouth almost as hot as if he had put  a burning coal in to it.    13. Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room and left to himself;  but he had not been there ten minutes before he began to move from one  place to another. He was of a bold, resolute temper, but not overburdened  with principle; for if he could have opened every cupboard, closet, and  drawer in the house, without being found out, he would have done it  directly.    14. Having looked around the room, he noticed a drawer to the table, and  made up his mind to peep therein. But no sooner did he lay hold of the  drawer knob than he set a large bell ringing, which was concealed under  the table. The old gentleman immediately answered the summons, and entered  the room.    15. Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the bell, that all his  impudence could not support him. He looked as though anyone might knock  him down with a feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had rung the  bell because he wanted anything. Rufus was much confused and stammered,  and tried to excuse himself, but all to no purpose, for it did not prevent  him from being ordered off the premises.    16. George Jones was then shown into the room by an old steward; and being  of a cautious disposition, he touched nothing, but only looked at the  things about him. At last he saw that a closet door was a little open,  and, thinking it would be impossible for anyone to know that he had opened  it a little more, he very cautiously opened it an inch farther, looking  down at the bottom of the door, that it might not catch against anything  and make a noise.    17. Now had he looked at the top, instead of the bottom, it  might have been better for him; for to the top of the door was  fastened a plug, which filled up the hole of a small barrel of shot.  He ventured to open the door another inch, and then another, till,  the plug being pulled out of the barrel, the leaden shot began to  pour out at a strange rate. At the bottom of the closet was placed a  tin pan, and the shot falling upon this pan made such a clatter that  George was frightened half out of his senses.    18. The old gentleman soon came into the room to inquire what was the  matter, and there he found George "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#9)"],[1,"the misery of a whole nation. In  short, the regular and methodical proceedings of an _aristocracy_ are  more intolerable than the very excesses of a _despotism_, and, in  general, much further from any remedy.    Thus, my lord, we have pursued _aristocracy_ through its whole progress;  we have seen the seeds, the growth, and the fruit. It could boast none  of the advantages of a _despotism_, miserable as those advantages were,  and it was overloaded with an exuberance of mischiefs, unknown even to  _despotism_ itself. In effect, it is no more than a disorderly tyranny.  This form, therefore, could be little approved, even in speculation, by  those who were capable of thinking, and could be less borne in practice  by any who were capable of feeling. However, the fruitful policy of man  was not yet exhausted. He had yet another farthing candle to supply the  deficiencies of the sun. This was the third form, known by political  writers under the name of _democracy_. Here the people transacted all  public business, or the greater part of it, in their own persons; their  laws were made by themselves, and, upon any failure of duty, their  officers were accountable to themselves, and to them only. In all  appearance, they had secured by this method the advantages of order and  good government, without paying their liberty for the purchase. Now, my  lord, we are come to the masterpiece of Grecian refinement, and Roman  solidity,--a popular government. The earliest and most celebrated  republic of this model was that of Athens. It was constructed by no less  an artist than the celebrated poet and philosopher, Solon. But no sooner  was this political vessel launched from the stocks, than it overset,  even in the lifetime of the builder. A tyranny immediately supervened;  not by a foreign conquest, not by accident, but by the very nature and  constitution of a _democracy_. An artful man became popular, the people  had power in their hands, and they devolved a considerable share of  their power upon their favorite; and the only use he made of this power  was, to plunge those who gave it into slavery. Accident restored their  liberty, and the same good fortune produced men of uncommon abilities  and uncommon virtues amongst them. But these abilities were suffered to  be of little service either to their possessors or to the state. Some of  these men, for whose sakes alone we read their history, they banished;  others they imprisoned, and all they treated with various circumstances  of the most shameful ingratitude. Republics have many things in the  spirit of absolute monarchy, but none more than this. A shining merit  is ever hated or suspected in a popular assembly, as well as in a court;  and all services done the state are looked upon as dangerous to the  rulers, whether sultans or senators. The _ostracism_ at Athens was built  upon this principle. The giddy people whom we have now under  consideration, being elated with some flashes of success, which they  owed to nothing less than any merit of their own, began to tyrannize  over their equals, who had associated with them for their common  defence. With their prudence they renounced all appearance of justice.  They entered into wars rashly and wantonly. If they were unsuccessful,  instead of growing wiser by their misfortune, they threw the whole blame  of their own misconduct on the ministers who had advised, and the  generals who had conducted, those wars; until by degrees they had cut  off all who could serve them in their councils or their battles. If at  any time these wars had a happier issue, it was no less difficult to  deal with them on account of their pride and insolence. Furious in their  adversity, tyrannical in their successes, a commander had more trouble  to concert his defence before the people, than to plan the operations of  the campaign. It was not uncommon for a general, under the horrid  _despotism_ of the Roman emperors, to be ill received in proportion to  the greatness of his services. Agricola is a strong instance of this. No  man had done greater things, nor with more honest ambition. Yet, on his  return to court, he was obliged to enter Rome with all the secrecy of a  criminal. He went to the palace, not like a victorious commander who had  merited and might demand the greatest rewards, but like an offender who  had come to supplicate a pardon for his crimes. His reception was  answerable; \"_Exceptusque brevi osculo et nullo sermone, turbae  servientium immixtus est_.\" Yet in that worst season of this worst of  monarchical[9] tyrannies, modesty, discretion, and a coolness of temper,  formed some kind of security, even for the highest merit. But at Athens,  the nicest and best studied behavior was not a sufficient guard for a  man of great capacity. Some of their bravest commanders were obliged to  fly their country, some to enter into the service of its enemies, rather  than abide a popular determination on their conduct, lest, as one of  them said, their giddiness might make the people condemn where they  meant to acquit; to throw in a black bean even when they intended a  white one.    The Athenians made a very rapid progress to the most enormous excesses.  The people, under no restraint, soon grew dissolute, luxurious, and  idle. They renounced all labor, and began to subsist themselves from the  public revenues. They lost all concern for their common honor or safety,  and could bear no advice that tended to reform them. At this time truth  became offensive to those lords the people, and most highly dangerous to  the speaker. The orators no longer ascended the _rostrum_, but to  corrupt them further with the most fulsome adulation. These orators were  all bribed by foreign princes on the one side or the other. And besides  its own parties, in this city there were parties, and avowed ones too,  for the Persians, Spartans, and Macedonians, supported each of them by  one or more demagogues pensioned and bribed to this iniquitous service.  The people, forgetful of all virtue and public spirit, and intoxicated  with the flatteries of their orators (these courtiers of republics, and  endowed with the distinguishing characteristics of all other courtiers),  this people, I say, at last arrived at that pitch of madness, that they  coolly and deliberately, by an express law, made it capital for any man  to propose an application of the immense sums squandered in public  shows, even to the most necessary purposes of the state. When you see  the people of this republic banishing and murdering their best and  ablest citizens, dissipating the public treasure with the most senseless  extravagance, and spending their whole time, as spectators or actors, in  playing, fiddling, dancing, and singing, does it not, my lord, strike  your imagination with the image of a sort of complex Nero? And does it  not strike you with the greater horror, when you observe, not one man  only, but a whole city, grown drunk with pride and power, running with a  rage of folly into the same mean and senseless debauchery and  extravagance? But if this people resembled Nero in their extravagance,  much more did they resemble and even exceed him in cruelty and  injustice. In the time of Pericles, one of the most celebrated times in  the history of that commonwealth, a king of Egypt sent them a donation  of corn. This they were mean enough to accept. And had the Egyptian  prince intended the ruin of this city of wicked Bedlamites, he could not  have taken a more effectual method to do it than by such an ensnaring  largess. The distribution of this bounty caused a quarrel; the majority  set on foot an inquiry into the title of the citizens; and upon a vain  pretence of illegitimacy, newly and occasionally set up, they deprived  of their share of the royal donation no less than five thousand of  their own body. They went further; they disfranchised them; and, having  once begun with an act of injustice, they could set no bounds to it. Not  content with cutting them off from the rights of citizens, they  plundered these unfortunate wretches of all their substance; and, to  crown this masterpiece of violence and tyranny, they actually sold every  man of the five thousand as slaves in the public market. Observe, my  lord, that the five thousand we here speak of were cut off from a body  of no more than nineteen thousand; for the entire number of citizens was  no greater at that time. Could the tyrant who wished the Roman people  but one neck; could the tyrant Caligula himself have done, nay, he could  scarcely wish for, a greater mischief than to have cut off, at one  stroke, a fourth of his people? Or has the cruelty of that series of  sanguine tyrants, the Caesars, ever presented such a piece of flagrant  and extensive wickedness? The whole history of this celebrated republic  is but one tissue of rashness, folly, ingratitude, injustice, tumult,  violence, and tyranny, and, indeed, of every species of wickedness that  can well be imagined. This was a city of wise men, in which a minister  could not exercise his functions; a warlike people, amongst whom a  general did not dare either to gain or lose a battle; a learned nation,  in which a philosopher could not venture on a free inquiry. This was the  city which banished Themistocles, starved Aristides, forced into exile  Miltiades, drove out Anaxagoras, and poisoned Socrates. This was a city  which changed the form of its government with the moon; eternal  conspiracies, revolutions daily, nothing fixed and established. A  republic, as an ancient philosopher has observed, is no one species of  government, but a magazine of every species; here you find every sort of  it, and that in the worst form. As there is a perpetual change, one  rising and the other falling, you have all the violence and wicked  policy by which a beginning power must always acquire its strength, and  all the weakness by which falling states are brought to a"]]]
