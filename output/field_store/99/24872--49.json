His map (generally known as  the Catalan Map, from the language of the inscriptions plentifully  scattered over it) is divided into eight horizontal strips, and on  the preceding page will be found a reduced reproduction, showing how  very accurately the coast line of the Mediterranean was reproduced  in these portulanos.    With the portulanos, geographical knowledge once more came back to  the lines of progress, by reverting to the representation of fact,  and, by giving an accurate representation of the coast line, enabled  mariners to adventure more fearlessly and to return more safely,  while they gave the means for recording any further knowledge. As  we shall see, they aided Prince Henry the Navigator to start that  series of geographical investigation which led to the discoveries  that close the Middle Ages. With them we may fairly close the history  of mediaeval geography, so far as it professed to be a systematic  branch of knowledge.    We must now turn back and briefly sum up the additions to knowledge  made by travellers, pilgrims, and merchants, and recorded in literary  shape in the form of travels.    [_Authorities:_ Lelewel, _Geographie du Moyen Age_, 4 vols. and  atlas, 1852; C. R. Beazley, _Dawn of Geography_, 1897, and Introduction  to _Prince Henry the Navigator_, 1895; Nordenskiold, _Periplus_,  1897.]          CHAPTER IV    MEDIAEVAL TRAVELS    In the Middle Ages--that is, in the thousand years between the  irruption of the barbarians into the Roman Empire in the fifth  century and the discovery of the New World in the fifteenth--the  chief stages of history which affect the extension of men's knowledge  of the world were: the voyages of the Vikings in the eighth and  ninth centuries, to which we have already referred; the Crusades,  in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; and the growth of the  Mongol Empire in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The extra  knowledge obtained by the Vikings did not penetrate to the rest  of Europe; that brought by the Crusades, and their predecessors,  the many pilgrimages to the Holy Land, only restored to Western  Europe the knowledge already stored up in classical antiquity;  but the effect of the extension of the Mongol Empire was of more  wide-reaching importance, and resulted in the addition of knowledge  about Eastern Asia which was not possessed by the Romans, and has  only been surpassed in modern times during the present century.    Towards the beginning of the thirteenth century, Chinchiz Khan,  leader of a small Tatar tribe, conquered most of Central and Eastern  Asia, including China. Under his son, Okkodai, these Mongol Tatars  turned from China to the West, conquered Armenia, and one of the  Mongol generals, named Batu, ravaged South Russia and Poland, and  captured Buda-Pest, 1241. It seemed as if the prophesied end of  the world had come, and the mighty nations Gog and Magog had at  last burst forth to fulfil the prophetic words. But Okkodai died  suddenly, and these armies were recalled. Universal terror seized  Europe, and the Pope, as the head of Christendom, determined to send  ambassadors to the Great Khan, to ascertain his real intentions.  He sent a friar named John of Planocarpini, from Lyons, in 1245,  to the camp of Batu (on the Volga), who passed him on to the court  of the Great Khan at Karakorum, the capital of his empire, of which  only the slightest trace is now left on the left bank of the Orkhon,  some hundred miles south of Lake Baikal.    Here, for the first time, they heard of a kingdom on the east coast  of Asia which was not yet conquered by the Mongols, and which was  known by the name of Cathay. Fuller information was obtained by  another friar, named WILLIAM RUYSBROEK, or Rubruquis, a Fleming,  who also visited Karakorum as an ambassador from St. Louis, and got  back to Europe in 1255, and communicated some of his information to  Roger Bacon. He says: \"These Cathayans are little fellows, speaking  much through the nose, and, as is general with all those Eastern  people, their eyes are very narrow.... The common money of Cathay  consists of pieces of cotton paper; about a palm in length and  breadth, upon which certain lines are printed, resembling the seal  of Mangou Khan. They do their writing with a pencil such as painters  paint with, and a single character of theirs comprehends several  letters, so as to form a whole word.\" He also identifies these  Cathayans with the Seres of the ancients. Ptolemy knew of these as  possessing the land where the silk comes from, but he had also heard  of the Sinae, and failed to identify the two. It has been conjectured  that the name of China came to the West by the sea voyage, and is  a Malay modification, while the names Seres and Cathayans came  overland, and thus caused confusion.    Other Franciscans followed these, and one of them, John of Montecorvino,  settled at Khanbalig (imperial city), or Pekin, as Archbishop (ob.  1358); while Friar Odoric of Pordenone, near Friuli, travelled in  India and China between 1316 and 1330, and brought back an account  of his voyage, filled with most marvellous mendacities, most of  which were taken over bodily into the work attributed to Sir John  Maundeville.    The information brought back by these wandering friars fades, however,  into insignificance before the extensive and accurate knowledge of  almost the whole of Eastern Asia brought back to Europe by Marco  Polo, a Venetian, who spent eighteen years of his life in the East.  His travels form an epoch in the history of geographical discovery  only second to the voyages of Columbus.    In 1260, two of his uncles, named Nicolo and Maffeo Polo, started  from Constaninople on a trading venture to the Crimea, after which  they were led to visit Bokhara, and thence on to the court of the  Great Khan, Kublai, who received them very graciously, and being  impressed with the desirability of introducing Western civilisation  into the new Mongolian empire, he entrusted them with a message to  the Pope, demanding one hundred wise men of the West to teach the  Mongolians the Christian religion and Western arts. The two brothers  returned to their native place, Venice, in 1269, but found no Pope  to comply with the Great Khan's request; for Clement IV. had died  the year before, and his successor had not yet been appointed. They  waited about for a couple of years till Gregory X. was elected, but he  only meagrely responded to the Great Khan's demands, and instructed  two Dominicans to accompany the Polos, who on this occasion took  with them their young nephew Marco, a lad of seventeen. They started  in November 1271, but soon lost the company of the Dominicans,  who lost heart and went back.    They went first to Ormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, then  struck northward through Khorasan Balkh to the Oxus, and thence  on to the Plateau of Pomir. Thence they passed the Great Desert  of Gobi, and at last reached Kublai in May 1275, at his summer  residence in Kaipingfu. Notwithstanding that they had not carried  out his request, the Khan received them in a friendly manner, and  was especially taken by Marco, whom he took into his own service;  and quite recently a record has been found in the Chinese annals,  stating that in the year 1277 a certain Polo was nominated a  Second-Class Commissioner of the PrivyCouncil. His duty was to  travel on various missions to Eastern Tibet, to Cochin China, and  even to India. The Polos amassed much wealth owing to the Khan's  favour, but found him very unwilling to let them return to Europe.  Marco Polo held several important posts; for three years he was  Governor of the great city of Yanchau, and it seemed likely that  he would die in the service of Kublai Khan.    But, owing to a fortunate chance, they were at last enabled to get  back to Europe. The Khan of Persia desired to marry a princess of  the Great Khan's family, to whom he was related, and as the young  lady upon whom the choice fell could not be expected to undergo  the hardships of the overland journey from China to Persia, it was  decided to send her by sea round the coast of Asia. The Tatars  were riot good navigators, and the Polos at last obtained permission  to escort the young princess on the rather perilous voyage. They  started in 1292, from Zayton, a port in Fokien, and after a voyage  of over two years round the South coast of Asia, successfully carried  the lady to her destined home, though she ultimately had to marry  the son instead of the father, who had died in the interim. They  took leave of her, and travelled through Persia to their own place,  which they reached in 1295. When they arrived at the ancestral  mansion of the Polos, in their coarse dress of Tatar cut, their  relatives for some time refused to believe that they were really  the long-lost merchants. But the Polos invited them to a banquet,  in which they dressed themselves all in their best, and put on new  suits for every course, giving the clothes they had taken off to  the servants. At the conclusion of the banquet they brought forth  the shabby dresses in which they had first arrived, and taking  sharp knives, began to rip up the seams, from which they took vast  quantities of rubies, sapphires, carbuncles, diamonds, and emeralds,  into which form they had converted most of their property. This  exhibition naturally changed the character of the welcome they  received from their relatives, who were then eager to learn how  they had come by such riches.    In describing the wealth of the Great Khan, Marco Polo, who was  the chief spokesman of the party, was obliged to use the numeral  \"million\" to express the amount of his wealth and the number of  the population over whom he ruled. This was regarded as part of  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#9)"],[1,"e, be omitted. (It is more frequently eaten       without butter.)    From this original toasting of the cheese many Englishmen still call  Welsh Rabbit \"Toasted Cheese,\" but Lady Llanover goes on to point out  that the Toasted Rabbit of her Wales and the Melted or Stewed Buck  Rabbit of England (which has become our American standard) are as  different in the making as the regional cheeses used in them, and she  says that while doctors prescribed the toasted Welsh as salubrious for  invalids, the stewed cheese of Olde England was \"only adapted to  strong digestions.\"    English literature rings with praise for the toasted cheese of Wales  and England. There is Christopher North's eloquent \"threads of  unbeaten gold, shining like gossamer filaments (that may be pulled  from its tough and tenacious substance).\"    Yet not all of the references are complimentary.    Thus Shakespeare in _King Lear_:        Look, look a mouse!      Peace, peace;--this piece of toasted cheese will do it.    And Sydney Smith's:         Old friendships are destroyed by toasted cheese, and hard salted       meat has led to suicide.    But Rhys Davis in _My Wales_ makes up for such rudenesses:         _The Welsh Enter Heaven_         The Lord had been complaining to St. Peter of the dearth of good       singers in Heaven. \"Yet,\" He said testily, \"I hear excellent       singing outside the walls. Why are not those singers here with       me?\"         St. Peter said, \"They are the Welsh. They refuse to come in; they       say they are happy enough outside, playing with a ball and boxing       and singing such songs as '_Suspan Fach_'\"         The Lord said, \"I wish them to come in here to sing Bach and       Mendelssohn. See that they are in before sundown.\"         St. Peter went to the Welsh and gave them the commands of the       Lord. But still they shook their heads. Harassed, St. Peter went       to consult with St. David, who, with a smile, was reading the       works of Caradoc Evans.         St. David said, \"Try toasted cheese. Build a fire just inside the       gates and get a few angels to toast cheese in front of it\" This       St. Peter did. The heavenly aroma of the sizzling, browning       cheese was wafted over the walls and, with loud shouts, a great       concourse of the Welsh came sprinting in. When sufficient were       inside to make up a male voice choir of a hundred, St Peter       slammed the gates. However, it is said that these are the only       Welsh in Heaven.    And, lest we forget, the wonderful drink that made Alice grow and grow  to the ceiling of Wonderland contained not only strawberry jam but  toasted cheese.    Then there's the frightening nursery rhyme:        The Irishman loved usquebaugh,        The Scot loved ale called Bluecap.      The Welshman, he loved toasted cheese,        And made his mouth like a mousetrap.        The Irishman was drowned in usquebaugh,        The Scot was drowned in ale,      The Welshman he near swallowed a mouse        But he pulled it out by the tail.    And, perhaps worst of all, Shakespeare, no cheese-lover, this tune in  _Merry Wives of Windsor_:        'Tis time I were choked by a bit of toasted cheese.    An elaboration of the simple Welsh original went English with Dr.  William Maginn, the London journalist whose facile pen enlivened the  _Blackwoods Magazine_ era with _Ten Tales_:         [Illustration] Dr. Maginn's Rabbit         Much is to be said in favor of toasted cheese for supper. It is       the cant to say that Welsh rabbit is heavy eating. I like it best       in the genuine Welsh way, however--that is, the toasted bread       buttered on both sides profusely, then a layer of cold roast beef       with mustard and horseradish, and then, on the top of all, the       superstratum, of Cheshire _thoroughly_ saturated, while, in the       process of toasting, with genuine porter, black pepper, and       shallot vinegar. I peril myself upon the assertion that this is       not a heavy supper for a man who has been busy all day till       dinner in reading, writing, walking or riding--who has occupied       himself between dinner and supper in the discussion of a bottle       or two of sound wine, or any equivalent--and who proposes to       swallow at least three tumblers of something hot ere he resigns       himself to the embrace of Somnus. With these provisos, I       recommend toasted cheese for supper.    The popularity of this has come down to us in the succinct  summing-up, \"Toasted cheese hath no master.\"    The Welsh original became simple after Dr. Maginn's supper sandwich  was served, a century and a half ago; for it was served as a savory to  sum up and help digest a dinner, in this form:       After-Dinner Rabbit         Remove all crusts from bread slices, toast on both sides and soak       to saturation in hot beer. Melt thin slices of sharp old cheese       in butter in an iron skillet, with an added spot of beer and dry       English mustard. Stir steadily with a wooden spoon and, when       velvety, serve a-sizzle on piping hot beer-soaked toast.    While toasted cheese undoubtedly was the Number One dairy dish of  Anglo-Saxons, stewed cheese came along to rival it in Elizabethan  London. This sophisticated, big-city dish, also called a Buck Rabbit,  was the making of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese on Fleet Street, where Dr.  Johnson later presided. And it must have been the pick of the town  back in the days when barrooms still had sawdust on the floor, for the  learned Doctor endorsed old Omar Khayyam's love of the pub with:  \"There is nothing which has been contrived by man by which so much  happiness is produced as by a good tavern.\" Yet he was no gourmet, as  may be judged by his likening of a succulent, golden-fried oyster to  \"a baby's ear dropped in sawdust.\"    Perhaps it is just as well that no description of the world's first  Golden Buck has come down from him. But we don't have to look far for  on-the-spot pen pictures by other men of letters at \"The Cheese,\" as  it was affectionately called. To a man they sang praises for that  piping hot dish of preserved and beatified milk.    Inspired by stewed cheese, Mark Lemon, the leading rhymester of  _Punch_, wrote the following poem and dedicated it to the memory of  Lovelace:        Champagne will not a dinner make,        Nor caviar a meal      Men gluttonous and rich may take        Those till they make them ill          If I've potatoes to my chop,          And after chop have cheese,          Angels in Pond and Spiers's shop          Know no such luxuries.    All that's necessary is an old-time \"cheese stewer\" or a reasonable  substitute. The base of this is what was once quaintly called a  \"hot-water bath.\" This was a sort of miniature wash boiler just big  enough to fit in snugly half a dozen individual tins, made squarish  and standing high enough above the bath water to keep any of it from  getting into the stew. In these tins the cheese is melted. But since  such a tinsmith's contraption is hard to come by in these days of  fireproof cooking glass, we suggest muffin tins, ramekins or even  small cups to crowd into the bottom of your double boiler or chafing  dish. But beyond this we plump for a revival of the \"cheese stewer\" in  stainless steel, silver or glass.    In the ritual at \"The Cheese,\" these dishes, brimming over, \"bubbling  and blistering with the stew,\" followed a pudding that's still famous.  Although down the centuries the recipe has been kept secret, the  identifiable ingredients have been itemized as follows: \"Tender steak,  savory oyster, seductive kidney, fascinating lark, rich gravy, ardent  pepper and delicate paste\"--not to mention mushrooms. And after the  second or third helping of pudding, with a pint of stout, bitter, or  the mildest and mellowest brown October Ale in a dented pewter pot,  \"the stewed Cheshire cheese.\"    Cheese was the one and only other course prescribed by tradition and  appetite from the time when Charles II aled and regaled Nell Gwyn at  \"The Cheese,\" where Shakespeare is said to have sampled this \"kind of  a glorified Welsh Rarebit, served piping hot in the square shallow  tins in which it is cooked and garnished with sippets of delicately  colored toast.\"    Among early records is this report of Addison's in _The Spectator_ of  September 25,1711:         They yawn for a Cheshire cheese, and begin about midnight, when       the whole company is disposed to be drowsy. He that yawns widest,       and at the same time so naturally as to produce the most yawns       amongst his spectators, carries home the cheese.    Only a short time later, in 1725, the proprietor of Simpson's in the  Strand inaugurated a daily guessing contest that drew crowds to his  fashionable eating and drinking place. He would set forth a huge  portion of cheese and wager champagne and cigars for the house that no  one present could correctly estimate the weight, height and girth of  it.    As late as 1795, when Boswell was accompanying Dr. Johnson to \"The  Cheese,\" records of St. Dunstan's Club, which also met there, showed  that the current price of a Buck Rabbit was tuppence, and that this  was also the amount of the usual tip.       Ye Original Recipe    1-1/2 ounces butter  1 cup cream  1-1/2 cups grated Cheshire cheese (more pungent, snappier, richer,  and more brightly colored than its first cousin, Cheddar)         Heat butter and cream together, then stir in the cheese and let       it stew.         You dunk fingers of toast directly into your individual tin, or       pour the Stewed Rabbit over toast and brown the top under a       blistering salamander.         The salamander is worth modernizing, too, so you can brand your       own Rabbits with your monogram or the design of your own       Rabbitry. Such a branding iron might be square, like the stew       tin, and about the size of a piece of toast    It is notable that there is no beer or ale in"]]]
