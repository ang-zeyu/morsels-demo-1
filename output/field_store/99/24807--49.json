Woman! the black  slavery of my dependence on you was frightful; but now I can look  you thanklessly in the face, for I have the means of living without  you. I spent sick and sleepless days and nights, but I gained an  independence; the merciful God blessed the efforts of the old man, who  strove to gain his livelihood--yes, I am independent of you both. I  came to see my son before I die--that is all I want.\"    Mrs. Lawson attempted a further justification of herself, but the  words died on her lips. The stern looks of the old man silenced her.    After remaining for a short time, he rose to take his departure; but,  at the earnest solicitations of his son, he consented to remain for  a few days, only on condition that he should pay for his board and  lodging. To this Mrs. Lawson made a feint of resistance, but agreed in  the end, as the terms offered by the old man were very advantageous.    \"I shall soon have a lodging for which no mortal is called on to  pay--the great mother-earth,\" said the old man, \"and I am glad, glad  to escape from this money-governed world. Do not smile so blandly on  me, both of you, and attend me with such false tenderness. There, take  it away,\" he said, as Mrs. Lawson was placing her most comfortable  footstool under his feet; \"there was no attendance, no care, not a  civil action or kind look for me when I was poor John Lawson, the  silly, most silly old man, who had given up all to his son and his  son's wife, for the love of them, and expected, like a fool as he was,  to live with them on terms of perfect equality, and to have the family  purse open to him for any trifling sums he wished to take. Go, go  for God's sake; try and look bitterly on me now, as you did when you  forced me out of your house. I detest your obsequious attentions--I  was as worthy of them ten years ago, before I dragged down my old age  to the debasing efforts of money-making. You know I am rich; you would  worship my money in me now. Not a smiling look, not a soft word you  bestow on me, but is for my riches, not for me. Ay, you think you have  my wealth in your grasp already; you know I cannot live long. Thank  God that my life is almost ended, and I hope my death will be a  benefit to you, in softening your hard hearts.\"    Mrs. Lawson drew some hope from his last words, and she turned away  her head to hide the joy which shone on her face.    In a few days the old man became seriously ill, and was altogether  confined to his room. As death evidently approached, his mind became  serene and calm, and he received the attentions which Mrs. Lawson and  his son lavished on him with a silent composure, which led them to  hope that he had completely forgotten their previous conduct to him.    The night on which he died, he turned to his son, and said a few  words, a very few words, regarding worldly matters. He exhorted  Henry to live in a somewhat less expensive style, and to cultivate a  spirit of contentment without riches; then he blessed God that he was  entering on a world in which he could hear no more of money or earthly  possession. He remained in a calm sleep during the greater part of the  night, they thought, but in the morning they found him dead.    The funeral was over, and the time was come in which the old man's  will was to be opened. Mrs. Lawson had waited for that moment--she  would have forcibly dragged time onward to that moment--she had  execrated the long hours of night since the old man's death--she had  still more anathemized the slowly passing days, when gazing furtively  through a corner of the blinded window, she saw fine equipages and  finely-dressed ladies passing, and she planned how she would shine  when the old man's wealth would be her own. She drew glorious mental  pictures of how she would burst from behind the shadowing cloud of  poverty, and dazzle all her acquaintances. Her dress, her carriage,  her style of living would be unique in her rank of life for taste and  costliness. She would show them she had got money--money at last--more  money than they all.    Now at last she sat and saw the will being opened; she felt that it  was a mere formality, for the old man had none but them to whom he  could leave his money; she never once doubted but all would be theirs;  she had reasoned and fancied herself into the firm conviction. Her  only fear was, that the amount might not be so large as she calculated  on.    She saw the packet opened. Her eyes dilated, her lips became parched,  her heart and brain burned with a fierce eagerness--money! money at  last! uttered the griping spirit within her.    The will, after beginning in the usual formal style, was as follows:    \"I bequeath to my son Henry's wife, Augusta Lawson, a high and noble  gift\"--Mrs. Lawson almost sprung from her seat with eagerness--\"the  greatest of all legacies, I bequeath to Augusta Lawson--Charity!  Augusta Lawson refused me a few shillings which I wished to bestow  on a starving woman; but now I leave her joint executrix, with my son  Henry, in the distribution of all my money and all my effects, without  any reservation, in charity, to be applied to such charitable purposes  as in this, my last will and testament, I have directed.\"    Then followed a statement of his effects and money, down to the most  minute particular. The money amounted to a very considerable sum; his  personal effects he directed to be sold, with the exception of his  very valuable diamond ring, which he bequeathed to the orphan daughter  of the poor relation in whose house he had taken refuge, and remained  for a short time, previous to his going abroad. All the proceeds \\  of his other effects, together with the whole amount of his money,  he bequeathed for different charitable purposes, and gave minute  directions as to the manner in which various sums were to be expended.  The largest amount he directed to be distributed in yearly donations  amongst the most indigent old men and women within a circuit of ten  miles of his native place. Those who were residing with their sons  and their sons' wives, were to receive by far the largest relief. He  appointed as trustees two of the most respectable merchants of the  town, to whom he gave authority to see the provisions of his will  carried out, in case his son and Mrs. Lawson should decline the duties  of executorship which he had bequeathed to them. The trustees were to  exercise a surveillance over Mr. and Mrs. Lawson, to see that the will  should in every particular be strictly carried into effect. The will  was dated and duly signed in the town in South America where the old  man had for some years resided. A codicil, containing the bequest of  the ring, with some further particulars regarding the charities, had  been added a few days previous to the old man's death.    Mrs. Lawson was carried fainting from the room before the reading of  the will was concluded. She was seized with violent fever, and her  life was despaired of. She recovered, however, and from the verge of  the eternal existence on which she had been, she returned to life with  a less worldly and ostentatious nature, and a soul more alive to the  impulses of kindness and charity.           *       *       *       *       *    HORACE VERNET, the painter, is in St. Petersburgh, and is soon  expected in Vienna, where he will study the uniform, scenery, &c.,  in order to paint various scenes in the Hungarian war.           *       *       *       *       *    HARRO HARRING has escaped from Norway into England, whence he has  issued a document, describing the circumstances of his departure, and  protesting against the arbitrary and unjust conduct of the Norwegian  Government.

A new edition of her  novel of _The Rebels_ has just been published, and the degree to which  it has been known is illustrated in the critical announcements of it.  The Albany _State Register_, like other journals, seems to think it a  fresh book, and observes of the writer:--\"The author of Hobornok has  always been a favorite with the public, though it is a long while  since we have had the pleasure of welcoming anything from his pen.  The present work, however, bears the impress of the talents which have  always marked his writings!\"           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE LEADER.]    OLD FEELINGS.

I watched until she laid the book    On the white casement-ledge again;    My heart beat high with joyful pain    On that strange oracle to look.      Day after day I would ascend    The staircase in that large old house,    And still and timorous as a mouse    I sat and made the book my friend.      I saw the birth of seas and skies,    The first sweet woman, first brave man;    I saw how morning light began,    How faded--over Paradise.      I stood with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#9)"],[1,"to overflowing of  care. I am submissive in all that may happen, but I cannot say that I  should be submissive with gladness. The chords of my soul become  relaxed and toneless when I think of all possibilities. I am not,  indeed, of that self-afflicting sort that carefully and artfully  destroys its own hope and constructs fear, and I do not believe that  it is God's will to separate us now--for every reason I cannot believe  it; but I know that you are suffering, and I am not with you, and yet  if I were there, I could perhaps contribute something to your  tranquillity, to your serenity, were it only that I should ride with  you--for you have no one else for that. It is so contrary to all my  views of gallantry, not to speak of my sentiments for you, that any  power whatever should keep me here when I know that you are suffering  and I could help and relieve you; and I am still at war with myself to  determine what my duty is before God and man. If I am not sooner  there, then it is fairly certain that I shall arrive in Reinfeld with  your father at Whitsuntide, probably a week from tomorrow. The cause  of your illness may lie deeper, or perhaps it is only that the odious  Spanish flies have affected you too powerfully. Who is this second  doctor you have called in? The frequent changing of doctors, and, on  one's own authority, using between-times all sorts of household  remedies, or remedies prescribed for others, I consider very bad and  wrong. Choose one of the local doctors in whom you have the most  confidence, but keep to him, too; do what he prescribes and nothing  else, nothing arbitrary; and, if you have not confidence in any of the  local men, we will both try to carry through the plan of bringing you  here, so that you may have thorough treatment under the direction of  Breiers, or some one else. The conduct of your parents in regard to  medical assistance, the obstinate refusal of your father, and, allied  to that, your mother's arbitrary changing and fixed prejudices, in  matters which neither of them understand, seem to me, between  ourselves, indefensible. He to whom God has intrusted a child, and an  only child at that, must employ for her preservation all the means  that God has made available, and not become careless of them through  fatalism or self-sufficiency. If writing tires you, ask your mother to  send us news. Moreover, it would seem to me very desirable if one of  your friends could be prevailed upon to go to you until you are  better. Whether a doctor can help you or not--forgive me, but you  cannot judge of that by your feelings. God's help is certainly  decisive, but it is just He who has given us medicine and physician  that, through them, His aid may reach us; and to decline it in this  form is to tempt Him, as though the sailor at sea should deprive  himself of a helmsman, with the idea that God alone can and will give  aid. If He does _not_ help us through the means He has placed within  our reach, then there is nothing left to do but to bow in silence  under His hand. If you should be able to come to Zimmerhausen after  Whitsuntide, please write to that effect beforehand if possible. If  your illness should become more serious, I shall certainly leave the  Landtag, and even if you are confined to your bed I shall be with you.  At such a moment I shall not let myself be restrained by such  questions of etiquette--that is my fixed resolve. You may be sure of  this, that I have long been helping you pray that the Lord may free  you from useless despondency and bestow upon you a heart cheerful and  submissive to God--and upon me, also; and I have the firm confidence  that He will grant our requests and guide us both in the paths that  lead to Him. Even though yours may often go to the left around the  mountain, and mine to the right, yet they will meet beyond.    The salt water has already gone from here. If you are too weak for  riding, then take a drive every day. When you are writing to me, and  begin to feel badly in the least, stop immediately; give me only a  short bulletin of your health, even if it is but three lines, for,  thank Heaven, words can be dispensed with between us--they cannot add  or take away anything, since our hearts look into each other, eye to  eye, to the very bottom, and though here and there, behind a fold,  some new thing is discovered, a strange thing it is not. Dear heart,  what stuff you talk (excuse my rudeness) when you say I must not come  if I would rather stop in Zimmerhausen or Angermuende at Whitsuntide!  How can I take pleasure anywhere while I know that you are suffering,  and moreover, am uncertain in what degree? With us two it is a  question, not of amusing and entertaining, but only of loving and  being together, spiritually, and, if possible, corporeally; and if you  should lie speechless for four weeks--sleep, or something else--I  would be nowhere else, provided nothing but my wish were to decide. If  I could only \"come to your door,\" I would still rather be there than  with my dear sister; and the sadder and sicker you are, so much the  more. But the door will not separate me from you, however ill you may  be. That is a situation in which the slave mutinies against his  mistress. * * *    Your faithful B.        Berlin, Tuesday Morning, May 18, '47.    _Dearest_,--The last letters from Reinfeld permit me to hope that your  illness is not so threatening at the moment as I feared from the first  news, although I am continually beset by all possible fears about you,  and thus am in a condition of rather complicated restlessness. * * *  My letter in which I told you of my election you have understood  somewhat, and your dear mother altogether, from a point of view  differing from that which was intended. I only wanted to make my  position exactly clear to you, and the apologies which to you seemed  perhaps forced, as I infer from your mother's letter, you may regard  as an entirely natural outflow of politeness. That I did not stand in  need of justification with you I very well know; but also that it must  affect us both painfully to see our fine plans cancelled. It was my  ardent wish to be a member of the Landtag; but that the Landtag and  you are fifty miles apart distressed me in spite of the fulfilment of  my wish. You women are, and always will be, unaccountable, and it is  better to deal with you by word of mouth than by writing. * * * I have  ventured once or twice on the speaker's platform with a few words, and  yesterday raised an unheard-of storm of displeasure, in that, by a  remark which was not explained clearly enough touching the character  of the popular uprising of 1813, I wounded the mistaken vanity of many  of my own party, and naturally had all the halloo of the opposition  against me. The resentment was great, perhaps for the very reason that  I told the truth in applying to 1813 the sentence that any one (the  Prussian people) who has been thrashed by another (the French) until  he defends himself can make no claim of service towards a third person  (our King) for so doing. I was reproached with my youth and all sorts  of other things. Now I must go over before today's session to see  whether, in printing my words, they have not turned them into  nonsense. * * *    Yours forever, B.      Berlin, Friday, May 21, '47.    _Tres chere Jeanneton_,--When you receive this letter you will know  that I am not to visit you in the holidays. I shall not offer  \"apologies,\" but reasons why it is not to be. I should miss certainly  four, and probably five, meetings of the estates, and, according to  the announcement we have received, the most important proceedings are  to be expected at the coming meetings. There it may depend upon one  vote, and it would be a bad thing if that were the vote of an  absentee; moreover, I have succeeded in acquiring some influence with  a great number, or, at least, with some delegates of the so-called  court party and the other ultra-conservatives from several provinces,  which I employ in restraining them so far as possible from bolting and  awkward shying, which I can do in the most unsuspected fashion when  once I have plainly expressed my inclination. Then, too, I have some  money affairs to arrange, for which I must make use of one of the  holidays. The Landtag will either be brought to a close on the 7th of  June--and in that case I should stay here until that date--or it will  continue in session until all the matters have been arranged, in which  event I should stay till after the decision of the important political  questions which are now imminent and shall be less conscientious about  all the insignificant petitions that follow after, and await their  discussion in Reinfeld. It will, besides, be pleasanter for you and  the mother not to have us both--the father and me--there at one time,  but relieving each other, so that you may be lonely for a shorter  time. * * * Your father will tell you how I stirred up the  hornet's-nest of the volunteers here lately, and the angry hornets  came buzzing to attack me; on the other hand, I had as compensation  that many of the older and more intelligent people drew near to  me--people I did not know at all--and assured me that I had said  nothing but the truth, and that was the very thing that had so  incensed the people. But I must take the field now; it is ten o'clock.  Please ask your father to write immediately about your health. I  should so much like to hear the opinion of another person besides your  mother. I am all right--only much excited. Farewell, and God guard  you.    Yours altogether and forever, B.      Berlin, May 26, '47.    _Dearest_,-- * * * If I were only through with the Landtag and the  delivery of Kniephof, could embrace you in health, and retire with you  to a hunting-lodge in the heart of green forest and the mountains,  where I should see no human face but yours! That is my hourly dream;  the rattling wheel-wor"]]]
