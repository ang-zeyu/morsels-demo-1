Tom had set up in his shop a powerful, but not very speedy, old  aeroplane engine, and had attached to it the device he hoped would help  him toward solving his problem of cutting down the noise. He had had  some success with it, and, after days and nights of labor, he invited  his father and Ned, as well as Mr. Damon, over to see what he hoped  would be a final experiment.    His visitors had assembled in the shop, and Eradicate was setting out  some refreshments which Tom had provided, the colored man being in his  element now.    \"What's all this figuring, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon, as he saw a series of  calculations on some sheets of paper lying on Tom's desk.    \"That's where I worked out how much faster sound traveled in hydrogen  gas than in the ordinary atmosphere,\" was the answer.  \"It goes about  four times as fast, or nearly four thousand two hundred feet a second.  You remember the rule, I suppose. 'The speed of sonorous vibrations  through gases varies inversely as the squares of the weights of equal  volumes of the gases,' or, in other words--\"    \"Give it to us chiefly in 'other words,' if you please, Tom!\" pleaded  Ned, with a laugh. \"Let that go and do some tricks. Start the engine  and let's see if we can hear it.\"    \"Oh, you can hear it all right,\" said Tom, as he approached the motor,  which was mounted on a testing block. \"The thing isn't perfected yet,  but I hope to have it soon. Rad! Where is that black rascal? Oh, there  you are! Come here, Rad!\"    \"Yaas sah, Massa Tom! Is I gwine to help yo' all in dish yeah job?\"    \"Yes. Just take hold of this lever, and when I say so pull it as hard  as you can.\"    \"Dat's whut I will, Massa Tom. Golly! ef dat no 'count giant was heah  now he'd see he ain't de only one whut's got muscle.  I'll pull good  an' hard, Massa Tom.\"    \"Yes, that's what I want you to. Now I guess we're all ready.  Can you  see, Dad--and Ned and Mr. Damon?\"    \"Yes,\" they answered. They stood near the side wall of the shop, while  Tom and Eradicate were at the testing block, on which the motor, with  the noise-eliminating devices attached, had been temporarily mounted.    \"All ready,\" called the young inventor, as he turned on the gas and  threw over the electrical switch. \"All ready! Pull the starting lever,  Rad, and when it's been running a little I'll throw on the silencer and  you can see the difference.\"    The motor began to hum, and there was a deafening roar, just as there  always is when the engine of an aeroplane starts. It was as though half  a dozen automobile engines were being run with the mufflers cut out.    \"Now I'll show you the difference!\" yelled Tom, though such was the  noise that not a word could be heard. \"This shows you what my silencer  will do.\"    Tom pulled another lever. There was at once a cessation of the  deafening racket, though it was not altogether ended. Then, after a  moment or two, there suddenly came a roar as though a blast had been  let off in the shop.    Tom and Eradicate were tossed backward, head over heels, as though by  the giant hands of Koku himself, and Mr. Damon, Ned, and Tom's father  saw the motor fly from the testing block and shoot through the roof of  the building with a rending, crashing, and splintering sound that could  be heard for a mile.          CHAPTER IX    AFTER A SPY      Curious as it may seem, Eradicate, the oldest and certainly not the  most energetic of the party assembled in the experiment room, was the  first to recover himself and arise. Tottering to his feet he gave one  look at the testing block, whence the motor had torn itself. Then he  looked at the prostrate figures around him, none of them hurt, but all  stunned and very much startled. Then the gaze of Eradicate traveled to  the hole in the roof. It was a gaping, ragged hole, for the motor was  heavy and the roof of flimsy material. And then the colored man  exclaimed:    \"Good land ob massy! Did I do dat?\"    His tone was one of such startled contrition, and so tragic, that Tom  Swift, rueful as he felt over the failure of his experiment and the  danger they had all been in, could not help laughing.    \"I take it, hearing that from you, Tom, that we're all right,\" said Ned  Newton, as he recovered himself and brushed some dirt off his coat. Ned  was a natty dresser.    \"Yes, we seem to be all right,\" replied Tom slowly. \"I can't say what  damage the flying motor has done outside, but--\"    \"Bless my insurance policy! but what happened?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"I saw  Eradicate pull on that lever as you told him to, Tom, and then things  all went topsy-turvy! Did he pull the wrong handle?\"    \"No, it wasn't Rad's fault at all,\" said Tom. \"The trouble was, as I  guess I'll find when I investigate, that I put too much power into the  motor, and the muffler didn't give any chance for the accumulated  exhaust gases to expand and escape. I didn't allow for that, and they  simply backed up, compressed and exploded. I guess that's the whole  explanation.\"    \"I'm inclined to agree with you, Son,\" said Mr. Swift dryly.  \"Don't  try to get rid of all the noise at once. Eliminate it by degrees and it  will be safer.\"    \"I guess so,\" agreed Tom.    By this time a score of workmen from the other shops had congregated  around the one though the roof of which the motor had been blown. Tom  opened the door to assure Jackson and the others that no one was hurt,  and then the young inventor saw the exploded motor had buried in the  dirt a short distance away from the experiment building.    \"Lucky none of us were standing over it when it went up,\" said Tom, as  he made an inspection of the broken machine. \"We'd have gone through  the roof with it.\"    \"She certainly went sailing!\" commented Ned. \"Must have been a lot of  power there, Tom.\"    And this was evidenced by the bent and twisted rods that had held the  motor to the testing block, and by the cylinders, some of which were  torn apart as though made of paper instead of heavy steel. But for the  fact that all the force of the explosion was directly upward, instead  of at the sides, none might have been left alive in the shop. All had  escaped most fortunately, and they realized this.    \"Well,\" queried Ned, as Tom gave orders to have the damaged machine  removed and the roof repaired, \"does this end the wonderful silent  motor, Tom?\"    \"End it! What do you mean--\"    \"I mean are you going to experiment any further?\"    \"Why, of course! Just because I've had one failure doesn't mean that  I'm going to give up. Especially when I know what the matter was--not  leaving any vent for the escaping gases. Why this isn't anything. When  I was perfecting my giant cannon I was nearly blown up more than once,  and you remember how we got stuck in the submarine.\"    \"I should say I did!\" exclaimed Ned with a shudder. \"I don't want any  more of that. But as between being blown through a roof and held at the  bottom of the sea, I don't know that there's much choice.\"    \"Well, perhaps not,\" agreed Tom. \"But as for ending my experiments, I  wouldn't dream of such a thing! Why, I've only just begun! I'll have a  silent motor yet!\"    \"And a non-explosive one, I hope,\" added Mr. Damon dryly.  \"Bless my  shoe buttons, Tom, but if my wife knew what danger I'd been in she'd  never let me come over to see you any more.\"    \"Well, the next time I invite you to a test I'll be more careful,\"  promised the young inventor.    \"There isn't going to be any next time as far as I'm concerned!\"  laughed Ned. \"I think it's safer to sell Liberty Bonds.\"    And, though they joked about it, they all realized the narrow escape  they had had. As for Eradicate, once he knew he had not been the one  who caused the damage, he felt rather proud of the part he had taken in  the mishap, and for many days he boasted about it to Koku.    True to his determination, Tom Swift did not give up his experimental  work on the silent motor. The machine that had been blown through the  roof was useless now, and it was sent to the scrap heap, after as much  of it as possible had been salvaged.  Then Tom got another piece of  apparatus out of his store room and began all over again.    He worked along the same lines as at first--providing a chamber for the  escaping gases of the exhaust to expend their noise and energy in, at  the same time laboring to cut down the concussion of the explosions in  the cylinder without reducing their force any. And that it was no easy  problem to do either of these, Tom had to admit as he progressed. All  previous types of mufflers or silencers had to be discarded and a new  one evolved.    \"Jackson, I need some one to help me,\" said Tom to his chief  mechanician one day. \"Haven't you a good man who is used to  experimental work that you can let me take from the works?\"    \"Why, yes,\" was the answer. \"Let me see. Roberts is busy on the new  bomb you got up, but I could take him off that--\"    \"No, don't!\" interposed Tom. \"I want that work to go on. Isn't there  some one else you can let me have?\"    \"Well, there's a new man who came to me well recommended. I took him on  last week, and he's a wonderful mechanic. Knows a lot about gas  engines. I could let you have him--Bower his name is.  The only thing  about it, though, is that I don't like to give you a man of whom I am  not dead certain, when you're working on a new device.\"    \"Oh, that will be all right,\" said Tom. \"There won't be any secrets he  can get, if you mean you think he might be up to spy work.\"    \"That's what I did mean, Tom. You never can tell, you know, and you  have some bitter enemies.\"    \"Yes, but I'll take care this man doesn't see the plans, or any of my  drawings. I only want some one to do the heavy assembling work on the  experimental muffler I'm getting up. We can let him think it's for a  new kind of automobile.\"    \"Oh,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12855"],[0,"Elizabethan Sea-Dogs: A Chronicle of Drake and His Companions (#9)"],[1,"esses, and gorgeous ones at that, during the course of her  reign. Her bathroom was wainscoted with Venetian mirrors so that she  could see 'nine-and-ninety' reflections of her very comely person as  she dipped and splashed or dried her royal skin. She set a hot pace for  all the votaries of dress to follow. All kinds of fashions came in from  abroad with the rush of new-found wealth; and so, instead of being  sanely beautiful, they soon became insanely bizarre. 'An Englishman,'  says Harrison, 'endeavouring to write of our attire, gave over his  travail, and only drew the picture of a naked man, since he could find  no kind of garment that could please him any whiles together.       I am an English man and naked I stand here,     Musing in my mind what raiment I shall were;     For now I will were this, and now I will were that;     And now I will were I cannot tell what.    Except you see a dog in a doublet you shall not see any so disguised as  are my countrymen of England. Women also do far exceed the lightness of  our men. What shall I say of their galligascons to bear out their attire  and make it fit plum round?' But the wives of 'citizens and burgesses,'  like all _nouveaux riches_, were still more bizarre than the courtiers.  'They cannot tell when or how to make an end, being women in whom all  kind of curiosity is to be seen in far greater measure than in women of  higher calling. I might name hues devised for the nonce, ver d'oye  'twixt green and yallow, peas-porridge tawny, popinjay blue, and the  Devil-in-the-head.'    Yet all this crude absurdity, 'from the courtier to the carter,' was the  glass reflecting the constantly increasing sea-borne trade, ever pushing  farther afield under the stimulus and protection of the sea-dogs. And  the Queen took precious good care that it all paid toll to her treasury  through the customs, so that she could have more money to build more  ships. And if her courtiers did stuff their breeches out with sawdust,  she took equally good care that each fighting man among them donned his  uniform and raised his troops or fitted out his ships when the time was  ripe for action.          CHAPTER V    HAWKINS AND THE FIGHTING TRADERS      Said Francis I of France to Charles V, King of Spain: 'Your Majesty and  the King of Portugal have divided the world between you, offering no  part of it to me. Show me, I pray you, the will of our father Adam, so  that I may see if he has really made you his only universal heirs!' Then  Francis sent out the Italian navigator Verrazano, who first explored the  coast from Florida to Newfoundland. Afterwards Jacques Cartier  discovered the St. Lawrence; Frenchmen took Havana twice, plundered the  Spanish treasure-ships, and tried to found colonies--Catholic in  Canada, Protestant in Florida and Brazil.    Thus, at the time when Elizabeth ascended the throne of England in 1558,  there was a long-established New Spain extending over Mexico, the West  Indies, and most of South America; a small New Portugal confined to part  of Brazil; and a shadowy New France running vaguely inland from the Gulf  of St. Lawrence, nowhere effectively occupied, and mostly overlapping  prior English claims based on the discoveries of the Cabots.    England and France had often been enemies. England and Spain had just  been allied in a war against France as well as by the marriage of Philip  and Mary. William Hawkins had traded with Portuguese Brazil under Henry  VIII, as the Southampton merchants were to do later on. English  merchants lived in Lisbon and Cadiz; a few were even settled in New  Spain; and a friendly Spaniard had been so delighted by the prospective  union of the English with the Spanish crown that he had given the name  of Londres (London) to a new settlement in the Argentine Andes.    Presently, however, Elizabethan England began to part company with  Spain, to become more anti-Papal, to sympathize with Huguenots and other  heretics, and, like Francis I, to wonder why an immense new world should  be nothing but New Spain. Besides, Englishmen knew what the rest of  Europe knew, that the discovery of Potosi had put out of business nearly  all the Old-World silver mines, and that the Burgundian Ass (as Spanish  treasure-mules were called, from Charles's love of Burgundy) had enabled  Spain to make conquests, impose her will on her neighbors, and keep paid  spies in every foreign court, the English court included. Londoners had  seen Spanish gold and silver paraded through the streets when Philip  married Mary--'27 chests of bullion, 99 horseloads + 2 cartloads of gold  and silver coin, and 97 boxes full of silver bars!' Moreover, the Holy  Inquisition was making Spanish seaports pretty hot for heretics. In  1562, twenty-six English subjects were burnt alive in Spain itself. Ten  times as many were in prison. No wonder sea-dogs were straining at the  leash.    Neither Philip nor Elizabeth wanted war just then, though each enjoyed a  thrust at the other by any kind of fighting short of that, and though  each winked at all kinds of armed trade, such as privateering and even  downright piracy. The English and Spanish merchants had commercial  connections going back for centuries; and business men on both sides  were always ready to do a good stroke for themselves.    This was the state of affairs in 1562 when young John Hawkins, son of  'Olde Master William,' went into the slave trade with New Spain. Except  for the fact that both Portugal and Spain allowed no trade with their  oversea possessions in any ships but their own, the circumstances  appeared to favor his enterprise. The American Indians were withering  away before the atrocious cruelties of the Portuguese and Spaniards,  being either killed in battle, used up in merciless slavery, or driven  off to alien wilds. Already the Portuguese had commenced to import  negroes from their West African possessions, both for themselves and for  trade with the Spaniards, who had none. Brazil prospered beyond  expectation and absorbed all the blacks that Portuguese shipping could  supply. The Spaniards had no spare tonnage at the time.    John Hawkins, aged thirty, had made several trips to the Canaries. He  now formed a joint-stock company to trade with the Spaniards farther  off. Two Lord Mayors of London and the Treasurer of the Royal Navy were  among the subscribers. Three small vessels, with only two hundred and  sixty tons between them, formed the flotilla. The crews numbered just a  hundred men. 'At Teneriffe he received friendly treatment. From thence  he passed to Sierra Leona, where he stayed a good time, and got into his  possession, partly by the sword and partly by other means, to the number  of 300 Negroes at the least, besides other merchandises.... With this  prey he sailed over the ocean sea unto the island of Hispaniola [Hayti]  ... and here he had reasonable utterance [sale] of his English  commodities, as also of some part of his Negroes, trusting the Spaniards  no further than that by his own strength he was able still to master  them.' At 'Monte Christi, another port on the north side of Hispaniola  ... he made vent of [sold] the whole number of his Negroes, for which he  received by way of exchange such a quantity of merchandise that he did  not only lade his own three ships with hides, ginger, sugars, and some  quantity of pearls, but he freighted also two other hulks with hides and  other like commodities, which he sent into Spain,' where both hulks and  hides were confiscated as being contraband.    Nothing daunted, he was off again in 1564 with four ships and a hundred  and seventy men. This time Elizabeth herself took shares and lent the  _Jesus of Lubeck_, a vessel of seven hundred tons which Henry VIII had  bought for the navy. Nobody questioned slavery in those days. The great  Spanish missionary Las Casas denounced the Spanish atrocities against  the Indians. But he thought negroes, who could be domesticated, would do  as substitutes for Indians, who could not be domesticated. The Indians  withered at the white man's touch. The negroes, if properly treated,  throve, and were safer than among their enemies at home. Such was the  argument for slavery; and it was true so far as it went. The argument  against, on the score of ill treatment, was only gradually heard. On the  score of general human rights it was never heard at all.    'At departing, in cutting the foresail lashings a marvellous misfortune  happened to one of the officers in the ship, who by the pulley of the  sheet was slain out of hand.' Hawkins 'appointed all the masters of his  ships an Order for the keeping of good company in this manner:--The  small ships to be always ahead and aweather of the _Jesus_, and to speak  twice a-day with the _Jesus_ at least.... If the weather be extreme,  that the small ships cannot keep company with the _Jesus_, then all to  keep company with the _Solomon_.... If any happen to any misfortune,  then to show two lights, and to shoot off a piece of ordnance. If any  lose company and come in sight again, to make three yaws [zigzags in  their course] and strike the mizzen three times. SERVE GOD DAILY. LOVE  ONE ANOTHER. PRESERVE YOUR VICTUALS. BEWARE OF FIRE, AND KEEP GOOD  COMPANY.'    John Sparke, the chronicler of this second voyage, was full of curiosity  over every strange sight he met with. He was also blessed with the pen  of a ready writer. So we get a story that is more vivacious than  Hakluyt's retelling of the first voyage or Hawkins's own account of the  third. Sparke saw for the first time in his life negroes, Caribs,  Indians, alligators, flying-fish, flamingoes, pelicans, and many other  strange sights. Having been told that Florida was full of unicorns he at  once concluded that it must also be full of lions; for how could the one  kind exist without the other kind to balance it?
