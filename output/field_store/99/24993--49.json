But on our instruments,  frequently too softly leathered, which have a full tone, and are so  strong and penetrating, especially in the bass, it is enough to endanger  one's sense of hearing to be subjected to such a senseless, incessant,  ridiculous, deafening use of the pedal; frequently, moreover, combined  with a hard, stiff touch, and an unsound, incorrect technique. A musical  interpretation in any degree tolerable is out of the question. You  cannot call that art, it cannot even be called manual labor: it is a  freak of insanity!    A few words to the better sort of players. The foot-piece to the right  on the piano-forte raises the dampers, and in that way makes the tones  resound and sing, and takes from them the dryness, shortness, and want  of fulness, which is always the objection to the piano-forte, especially  to those of the earlier construction. This is certainly an advantage;  the more the tone of the piano-forte resembles singing, the more  beautiful it is. But, in order not to injure the distinctness and  detract from the clear phrasing of the performance, a very skilful and  prudent use of the pedal is necessary in rapid changes of harmony,  particularly in the middle and lower portion of the instrument.    You all use the pedal too much and too often, especially on large, fine  concert pianos of the new construction, which, with their heavy  stringing, have in themselves a fuller, more vibrating tone; at least  you do not let it fall frequently enough, and with precision. You must  listen to what you are playing. You do not play for yourselves alone;  frequently you play to hearers who are listening for the first time to  the pieces you are performing. Try a few passages without pedal,--for  instance, those in which the changes of the harmony succeed each other  rapidly, even in the highest treble,--and see what repose, what serene  enjoyment, what refreshment is afforded, what delicate shading is  brought out. Or at first listen, and try to feel it in the playing of  others; for your habit is so deeply rooted that you no longer know when  and how often you use the pedal. Chopin, that highly gifted, elegant,  sensitive composer and performer, may serve as a model for you here. His  widely dispersed, artistic harmonies, with the boldest and most striking  suspensions, for which the fundamental bass is essential, certainly  require the frequent use of the pedal for fine harmonic effect. But, if  you examine and observe the minute, critical directions in his  compositions, you can obtain from him complete instruction for the nice  and correct use of the pedal.    By way of episode to my sorrowful lecture on the pedal, we will take a  walk through the streets some beautiful evening. What is it that we hear  in almost every house? Unquestionably it is piano-playing; but what  playing! It is generally nothing but a continual confusion of different  chords, without close, without pause; slovenly passages, screened by the  raised pedal; varied by an empty, stiff, weak touch, relying upon the  pedal for weight. We will escape into the next street. Oh, horrors! what  a thundering on this piano, which, by the way, is sadly out of tune! It  is a grand--that is, a long, heavy--etude, with the most involved  passages, and a peculiar style of composition, probably with the title  \"On the Ocean,\" or \"In Hades,\" or \"Fancies of the Insane;\" pounded off  with the pedal raised through the most marvellous changes of harmonies.  Finally, the strings snap, the pedal creaks and moans; conclusion,--_c_,  _c_ sharp, _d_, _d_ sharp resound together through a few exhausted bars,  and at last die away in the warm, soft, delicious air. Universal  applause from the open windows! But who is the frantic musician who is  venting his rage or this piano? It is a Parisian or other travelling  composer, lately arrived with letters of recommendation, who has just  been giving a little rehearsal of what we may expect to hear shortly in  a concert at the \"Hotel de Schmerz.\"          CHAPTER VI.    THE SOFT-PEDAL SENTIMENT.      You exclaim: \"What is that?--a sentiment for the soft pedal! a sentiment  of any kind in our times! most of all, a musical sentiment! I have not  heard of such a thing in a concert-room for a long time!\"    When the foot-piece to the left on the piano is pressed down, the  key-board is thereby moved to the right; so that, in playing, the  hammers strike only two of the three strings, in some pianos only one.  In that way the tone is made weaker, thinner, but more singing and more  tender. What follows from this? Many performers, seized with a piano  madness, play a grand bravoura piece, excite themselves fearfully,  clatter up and down through seven octaves of runs, with the pedal  constantly raised,--bang away, put the best piano out of tune in the  first twenty bars,--snap the strings, knock the hammers off their  bearings, perspire, stroke the hair out of their eyes, ogle the  audience, and make love to themselves. Suddenly they are seized with a  sentiment! They come to a _piano_ or _pianissimo_, and, no longer  content with one pedal, they take the soft pedal while the loud pedal is  still resounding. Oh, what languishing! what soft murmuring, and what a  sweet tinkling of bells! what tenderness of feeling! what a soft-pedal  sentiment! The ladies fall into tears, enraptured by the pale,  long-haired young artist.    I describe here the period of piano mania, which has just passed its  crisis; a period which it is necessary to have lived through, in order  to believe in the possibility of such follies. When, in the beginning of  this century, the piano attained such conspicuous excellence and  increased power, greater technical skill could not fail to be called  out; but, after a few years, this degenerated into a heartless and  worthless dexterity of the fingers, which was carried to the point of  absurdity and resulted in intellectual death. Instead of aiming to  acquire, before all things, a beautiful, full tone on these  rich-sounding instruments, which admit of so much and such delicate  shading, essential to true excellence of performance, the object was  only to increase mechanical facility, and to cultivate almost  exclusively an immoderately powerful and unnatural touch, and to improve  the fingering in order to make possible the execution of passages,  roulades, finger-gymnastics, and stretches, which no one before had  imagined or considered necessary. From this period dates the  introduction of _virtuoso_ performances with their glittering  tawdriness, without substance and without music, and of the frightful  eccentricities in art, accompanied by immeasurable vanity and  self-conceit,--the age of \"finger-heroes.\" It is indeed a melancholy  reflection, for all who retain their senses, that this charlatanry is  made the solitary aim of numberless ignoble performers, sustained by the  applause of teachers and composers equally base. It is sad to see how,  engaged in artificial formalisms and in erroneous mechanical studies,  players have forgotten the study of tone and of correct delivery, and  that few teachers seek to improve either themselves or their pupils  therein. Otherwise they would see and understand that, on a good piano,  such as are now to be found almost everywhere, it is possible with  correct playing, founded on a right method, to play, without external  aids, _forte_, _fortissimo_, _piano_, _pianissimo_,--in a word, with  every degree of shading, and with at least formal expression; and that  this style of playing, with the requisite mechanical skill, sounds far  more pure, and is more satisfactory than when a feeling is affected  through the crude, unskilful, and absurd use of the pedal, especially of  the soft pedal of which we are now speaking. This affectation only gives  one more proof of our unhealthy, stupid, and unmusical infancy in piano  performances. A good-natured public, drummed up and brought together by  patient persuasion and by urgent recommendations, of which _virtuosos_  can obtain an abundance (for the tormented cities which they have  visited cannot otherwise get rid of them), attend these concerts and  listen to dozens of such inexperienced piano-players. One plays exactly  like another, with more or less faulty mechanical execution; and none of  them are able, with all their thumping and caressing of the keys, to  bring out from the instrument a broad, healthy, full, and beautiful  tone, delicately shaded and distinct even to the softest _pp._ But,  instead of this, they fall into a pedal sentiment; _i.e._, they play  with outside pretension, and with intrinsic emptiness.    You unworthy performers, who have so disgusted the artistic public with  piano-playing that they will no longer listen to fine, intelligent,  sensible artists, whose dignity does not permit them to force  themselves into the concert-hall, or to drag people into it from the  streets! you base mortals, who have exposed this beautiful art to shame!  I implore you to abandon the concert platform, your battle-field! Hack  at the piano no longer! Find positions on a railroad or in a factory.  There you may perhaps make yourselves useful; while by the lessons you  give (for it usually comes to that, after you have travelled all over  the world) you will only ruin our young people, now growing up with  promising talent for piano-playing, and will produce successors like  yourselves, but not artists.    I must whisper one thing more in your ear. I will say nothing about  simple truthfulness, about tenderness and sincerity of feeling, or  wholesome refinement, about poetry, inspiration, or truly impassioned  playing. But, if your ears are not already too much blunted, you should  be able to discover, at least in a very few minutes, on any instrument,  unless it is of the worst sort, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#9)"],[1,"he named as general of the cavalry Lucius Tarquitius, a brave  old patrician who had become too poor even to keep a horse. Marching out  at the head of all the men who could bear arms, he thoroughly routed the  AEqui, and then resigned his dictatorship at the end of sixteen days. Nor  would he accept any of the spoil, but went back to his plough, his only  reward being that his son was forgiven and recalled from banishment.    [Illustration: PLOUGHING]    These are the grand old stories that came down from old time, but how  much is true no one can tell, and there is reason to think that, though  the leaders like Cincinnatus and Coriolanus might be brave, the Romans  were really pressed hard by the Volscians and AEqui, and lost a good deal  of ground, though they were too proud to own it. No wonder, while the  two orders of the state were always pulling different ways. However, the  tribune Icilius succeeded in the year 454 in getting the Aventine Hill  granted to the plebeians; and they had another champion called Lucius  Sicinius Dentatus, who was so brave that he was called the Roman  Achilles. He had received no less than forty-five wounds in different  fights before he was fifty-eight years old, and had had fourteen civic  crowns. For the Romans gave an oak-leaf wreath, which they called a  civic crown, to a man who saved the life of a fellow-citizen, and a  mural crown to him who first scaled the walls of a besieged city. And  when a consul had gained a great victory, he had what was called a  triumph. He was drawn in his chariot into the city, his victorious  troops marching before him with their spears waving with laurel boughs,  a wreath of laurel was on his head, his little children sat with him in  the chariot, and the spoil of the enemy was carried along. All the  people decked their houses and came forth rejoicing in holiday array,  while he proceeded to the Capitol to sacrifice an ox to Jupiter there.  His chief prisoners walked behind his car in chains, and at the moment  of his sacrifice they were taken to a cell below the Capitol and there  put to death, for the Roman was cruel in his joy. Nothing was more  desired than such a triumph; but such was often the hatred between the  plebeians and the patricians, that sometimes the plebeian army would  stop short in the middle of a victorious campaign to hinder their consul  from having a triumph. Even Sicinius is said once to have acted thus,  and it began to be plain that Rome must fall if it continued to be thus  divided against itself.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER X.    THE DECEMVIRS.    B.C. 450.      The Romans began to see what mischiefs their quarrels did, and they  agreed to send three of their best and wisest men to Greece to study the  laws of Solon at Athens, and report whether any of them could be put in  force at Rome.    To get the new code of laws which they brought home put into working  order, it was agreed for the time to have no consuls, praetors, nor  tribunes, but ten governors, perhaps in imitation of the nine Athenian  archons. They were called Decemvirs (_decem_, ten; _vir_, a man),  and at their head was Lucius Appius Claudius, the grandson of him who had  killed himself to avoid being condemned for his harshness. At first they  governed well, and a very good set of laws was drawn up, which the  Romans called the Laws of the Ten Tables; but Appius soon began to give  way to the pride of his nature, and made himself hated. There was a war  with the AEqui, in which the Romans were beaten. Old Sicinius Dentatus  said it was owing to bad management, and, as he had been in one hundred  and twenty battles, everybody believed him. Thereupon Appius Claudius  sent for him, begged for his advice, and asked him to join the army that  he might assist the commanders. They received him warmly, and, when he  advised them to move their camp, asked him to go and choose a place, and  sent a guard with him of one hundred men. But these were really wretches  instructed to kill him, and as soon as he was in a narrow rocky pass  they set upon him. The brave old warrior set his back against a rock and  fought so fiercely that he killed many, and the rest durst not come near  him, but climbed up the rock and crushed him with stones rolled down on  his head. Then they went back with a story that they had been attacked  by the enemy, which was believed, till a party went out to bury the  dead, and found there were only Roman corpses all lying round the  crushed body of Sicinius, and that none were stripped of their armor or  clothes. Then the true history was found out, but the Decemvirs  sheltered the commanders, and would believe nothing against them.    Appius Claudius soon after did what horrified all honest men even more  than this treachery to the brave old soldier. The Forum was not only the  place of public assembly for state affairs, but the regular  market-place, where there were stalls and booths for all the wares that  Romans dealt in--meat stalls, wool shops, stalls where wine was sold in  earthenware jars or leathern bottles, and even booths where reading and  writing was taught to boys and girls, who would learn by tracing letters  in the sand, and then by writing them with an iron pen on a waxen table  in a frame, or with a reed upon parchment. The children of each family  came escorted by a slave--the girls by their nurse, the boys by one  called a pedagogue.    [Illustration: DEATH OF VIRGINIA.]    Appius, when going to his judgment-seat across the Forum, saw at one of  these schools a girl of fifteen reading her lesson. She was so lovely  that he asked her nurse who she was, and heard that her name was  Virginia, and that she was the daughter of an honorable plebeian and  brave centurion named Virginius, who was absent with the army fighting  with the AEqui, and that she was to marry a young man named Icilius as  soon as the campaign was over. Appius would gladly have married her  himself, but there was a patrician law against wedding plebeians, and he  wickedly determined that if he could not have her for his wife he would  have her for his slave.    There was one of his clients named Marcus Claudius, whom he paid to get  up a story that Virginius' wife Numitoria, who was dead, had never had  any child at all, but had bought a baby of one of his slaves and had  deceived her husband with it, and thus that poor Virginia was really his  slave. As the maiden was reading at her school, this wretch and a band  of fellows like him seized upon her, declaring that she was his  property, and that he would carry her off. There was a great uproar, and  she was dragged as far as Appius' judgment-seat; but by that time her  faithful nurse had called the poor girl's uncle Numitorius, who could  answer for it that she was really his sister's child. But Appius would  not listen to him, and all that he could gain was that judgment should  not be given in the matter until Virginius should have been fetched from  the camp.    [Illustration: CHARIOT RACES.]    Virginius had set out from the camp with Icilius before the messengers  of Appius had reached the general with orders to stop him, and he came  to the Forum leading his daughter by the hand, weeping, and attended by  a great many ladies. Claudius brought his slave, who made false oath  that she had sold her child to Numitoria; while, on the other hand, all  the kindred of Virginius and his wife gave such proof of the contrary as  any honest judge would have thought sufficient, but Appius chose to  declare that the truth was with his client. There was a great murmur of  all the people, but he frowned at them, and told them he knew of their  meetings, and that there were soldiers in the Capitol ready to punish  them, so they must stand back and not hinder a master from recovering  his slave.    Virginius took his poor daughter in his arms as if to give her a last  embrace, and drew her close to the stall of a butcher where lay a great  knife. He wiped her tears, kissed her, and saying, \"My own dear little  girl, there is no way but this,\" he snatched up the knife and plunged it  into her heart, then drawing it out he cried, \"By this blood, Appius, I  devote thy blood to the infernal gods.\"    He could not reach Appius, but the lictors could not seize him, and he  mounted his horse and galloped back to the army, four hundred men  following him, and he arrived still holding the knife. Every soldier who  heard the story resolved no longer to bear with the Decemvirs, but to  march back to the city at once and insist on the old government being  restored. The Decemvir generals tried to stop them, but they only  answered, \"We are men with swords in our hands.\" At the same time there  was such a tumult in the city, that Appius was forced to hide himself in  his own house while Virginia's corpse was carried on a bier through the  streets, and every one laid garlands, scarfs, and wreaths of their own  hair upon it. When the troops arrived, they and the people joined in  demanding that the Decemvirs should be given up to them to be burnt  alive, and that the old magistrates should be restored. However, two  patricians, Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, were able so to arrange  matters that the nine comparatively innocent Decemvirs were allowed to  depose themselves, and Appius only was sent to prison, where he killed  himself rather than face the trial that awaited him. The new code of  laws, however, remained, but consuls, praetors, tribunes, and all the  rest of the magistrates were restored, and in the year 445 a law was  passed which enabled patricians and plebeians to intermarry.
