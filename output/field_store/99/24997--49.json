The answer, of course, is,  _The meek shall inherit the earth_. But if the foreigner is bigger than  you, don't tell him until you have got to a safe distance.    It is this attitude of self-assertion, coupled with the tacit assumption  that the others don't count much, that makes the English so detested  on the Continent. It is well reflected in the claim to have their own  language adopted as a common means of communication between all other  peoples.    This claim is not put forward in any spirit of deliberate insolence,  or with the intention of ignoring other people's feelings; though the  very unconsciousness of any arrogance in such an attitude really renders  it more galling, on account of the tacit conclusion involved therein.  It is merely the outcome of ignorance and of that want of tact which  consists of inability to put oneself at the point of view of others.  The interests of English-speaking peoples are enormous, far greater  than those of any other group of nations united by a common bond of  speech. But it is a form of narrow provincial ignorance to refuse on  that account to recognize that, compared to the whole bulk of civilized  people, the English speakers are in a small minority, and that the  majority includes many high-spirited peoples with a strongly developed  sense of nationality, and destined to play a very important part in the  history of the world. Any sort of movement to have English or any other  national language adopted officially as a universal auxiliary language  would at once entail a boycott of the favoured language on the part  of a ring of other powerful nations, who could not afford to give a  rival the benefit of this augmented prestige. And it is precisely upon  universality of adoption that the great use of an international language  will depend.    To sum up: the ignorance of contemporary history and fact displayed in  the suggestion of giving the preference to any national language is only  equalled by its futility, for it _is_ futile, to put forward a scheme that  has no chance of even being discussed internationally as a matter of  practical politics.    A proof is that precisely the same objection to an auxiliary language  is raised in France--namely, that it is unpatriotic, because it would  displace French from that proud position.    The above remarks will be wholly misunderstood if they are taken to  imply any spirit of Little Englandism on the part of the writer.  On the contrary, he is ardently convinced of the mighty _r√¥le_ that  will be played among the nations by the British Empire, and has had  much good reason in going to and fro in the world to ponder on its  unique achievement in the past. When fully organized on some terms  of partnership as demanded by the growth of the Colonies, it will go  even farther in the future. But all this has nothing to do with an  international language. Howsoever mighty, the British Empire will not  swallow up the earth--at any rate, not in our time. And till it does, it  is not practical politics to expect other peoples to recognize English  as the international language as between themselves.    There are, in fact, two quite separate questions:    (1) Supposing it is possible for any national language to become the  international one, which has the best claims?    (2) Is it possible for any national language to be adopted as the  international one?    To question (1) the answer undoubtedly is \"English.\" It is already the  language of the sea, and to a large extent the medium for transacting  business between Europeans and Asiatic races, or between the Asiatic  races themselves.[1] Moreover, except for its pronunciation and  spelling, it has intrinsically the best claim, as being the furthest  advanced along the common line of development of Aryan language.[2] But  the discussion of this question has no more than an academic interest,  because the answer to question (2) is, for political reasons, in the  negative.       [1]Another argument is that based on the comparative numbers     of people who speak the principal European languages as their     mother-tongue. No accurate statistics exist, but an interesting     estimate is quoted by Couturat and Leau (_Hist. de la langue     universelle_), which puts English first with about 120,000,000,     followed at a distance of 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 by Russian.       [2]This is explained in Part III., chap. i., _q.v._                                         X             CAN THE EVOLUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE BE LEFT          TO THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION BY FREE COMPETITION?    \"You base your argument for an international language mainly on the  operation of economical laws. Be consistent, then; leave the matter  to Nature. By unlimited competition the best language is bound to be  evolved and come to the top in the struggle for life. Let the fittest  survive, and don't bother about Esperanto.\"    On a first hearing this sounds fairly plausible, yet it is honeycombed  with error.    In the first place, it proves too much. The same argument could be  adduced for the abandonment of effort of all kind whatever to improve  upon Nature and her processes. \"You can walk and run and swim. Don't  bother to invent boats and bicycles, trains and aeroplanes, that will  bring you more into touch with other peoples. Let Nature evolve the best  form of international locomotion.\"    Again, Nature does not tend towards uniformity. She produces an infinity  of variety in the individual, and out of this variety she selects and  evolves certain prevailing types. But these types differ widely within  the limits of the world under varying conditions of environment. What  we are seeking to establish is world-wide uniformity, in spite of  difference of environment.    Again, the argument confuses a sub-characteristic with an organism. A  language is not an organism, but one of the characteristics of man.  After the lapse of countless ages there are grey horses and black, bay  and chestnut, presumably because greyness and blackness and the rest  are incidental characteristics of a horse. No one of them gives him a  greater advantage than the others in his struggle for life, or helps him  particularly to perform the functions of horsiness.    Just in the same way a man may be equally well equipped with all the  qualities that make for success, whether he speaks English or French,  Russian or Japanese. It cannot be shown that language materially helps  one people as against another, or even that the best race evolves the  best language.[1] Take the last mentioned. If there is one people on the  face of the globe who rejoice in an impossible language, it is the  Japanese. In the early days of foreign intercourse a good Jesuit father  reported that the Japanese were courteous and polite to strangers, but  their language was plainly the invention of the devil. To a modern mind  the language may have outlived its putative father, but its reputation  has not improved, so far as ease is concerned. Yet who will say that it  has impaired national efficiency?       [1]Greece went down before Rome. Which was the better race, meaning     by \"better\" the more capable of imposing its language and manners on     the world? Yet who doubts that Greek was the better language?    The fact is, that for purposes of transaction of ordinary affairs by  those who speak it as a mother tongue, one language is about as good as  another. Whether it survives or spreads depends, not upon its intrinsic  qualities as a language, but upon the success of the race that speaks  it.[1] There is, therefore, no presumption that the best or the most  suitable or the easiest language will spread over the world by its own  merits, or even that any easy or regular language will be evolved.  Printing and education have altogether arrested the natural process of  evolution of language on the lips of men. This is one justification for  the application of new artificial reforms to language and spelling,  which tend no longer to move naturally with the times as heretofore.       [1]A curious phenomenon of our day suggests a possible partial     exception. In Switzerland French is steadily encroaching and bearing     back German. Is this owing to the intrinsic qualities of French     language and civilization? Materially, the Germans have the greater     expansive power.    As regards free competition between rival artificial languages, the  same considerations hold good. The worse might prevail just as easily  as the better, because the determining factor is not the nature of the  language, but the influence and general capacity of the rival backers.  Of course a very bad or hard artificial language would not prevail  against an easy one. But beyond a certain point of ease a universal  language cannot go (ease meaning the ease of all), and that limit has  probably been about reached now. Between future schemes there will be  such a mere fractional difference in respect of ease, that competition  becomes altogether beside the point. The thing is to take an easy one  and stick to it.                                         XI          OBJECTIONS TO AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE ON AESTHETIC GROUNDS    One of the commonest arguments that advocates of a universal language  have to face runs something like this:    \"Yes, there really does seem to be something in what you say--your  language may save time and money and grease the wheels of business;  but, after all, we are not all business men, nor are we all out after  dollars. Just think what a dull, drab uniformity your scheme would  lay over the lands like a pall. By the artificial removal of natural  barriers you are aiding and abetting the vulgarization of the world.  You are doing what in you lies to eliminate the racy, the local, the  picturesque.

Bird of the broad and sweeping wing!       Thy home is high in heaven,     Where the wide storms their banners fling,       And the tempest clouds are driven.    3. At midnight, in his guarded tent,       The Turk lay dreaming of the hour     When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,       Should tremble at his power.    4. On New Year's night, an old man stood at his window, and looked, with a  glance of fearful despair, up the immovable, unfading heaven, and down  upon the still, pure, white earth, on which no one was now so joyless and  sleepless as he.        SHORT QUANTITY. (51)    1. Quick! or he faints! stand with the cordial near!    2. Back to thy punishment, false fugitive!    3. Fret till your proud heart breaks!  Must I observe you? Must I crouch  beneath your testy humor?    4. Up drawbridge, grooms! what, warder, ho!     Let the portcullis fall!    5.

MOVEMENT. (51)    Movement is the rapidity with which the voice moves in reading and  speaking. It varies with the nature of the thought or sentiment to be  expressed, and should be increased or diminished as good taste may  determine. With pupils generally, the tendency is to read too fast. The  result is, reading or speaking in too high a key and an unnatural style of  delivery--both of which faults are difficult to be corrected when once  formed. The kinds of movement are Slow, Moderate, and Quick.    DIRECTIONS.--Read a selection as slowly us possible, without drawling.  Read it again and again, increasing the rate of movement at each reading,  until it can be read no faster without the utterance becoming indistinct.  Reverse this process, reading more and more slowly at each repetition,  until the slowest movement is obtained.      SLOW MOVEMENT. (52)    1. Oh that those lips had language! Life has passed     With me but roughly, since I heard them last.    2. A tremulous sigh from the gentle night wind       Through the forest leaves slowly is creeping,     While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,       Keep guard; for the army is sleeping.    3. O Lord'! have mercy upon us, miserable offenders'!    4. So live, that when thy summons comes to join     The innumerable caravan that moves     To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take     His chamber in the silent halls of death,     Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,     Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed     By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave     Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch     About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.      MODERATE MOVEMENT. (52)    1. The good', the brave', the beautiful',       How dreamless' is their sleep,     Where rolls the dirge-like music'       Of the over-tossing deep'!     Or where the surging night winds       Pale Winter's robes have spread     Above the narrow palaces,       In the cities of the dead'!    2. Lives of great men all remind us       We can make our lives sublime,     And, departing, leave behind us       Footprints on the sands of time.    3. Cast your eyes over this extensive country. Observe the salubrity of  your climate, the variety and fertility of your soil; and see that soil  intersected in every quarter by bold, navigable streams, flowing to the  east and to the west, as if the finger of heaven were marking out the  course of your settlements, inviting you to enterprise, and pointing the  way to wealth.      QUICK MOVEMENT. (53)    1. Awake'! arise'! or be forever fallen.    2. Merrily swinging on brier and weed,       Near to the nest of his little dame,     Over the mountain side or mead,       Robert of Lincoln is telling his name.    3. Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace--     Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;     I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,     Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,     Rebuckled the check strap, chained slacker the bit,     Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.    4. Oh my dear uncle, you don't know the effect of a fine spring morning  upon a fellow just arrived from Russia. The day looked bright, trees  budding, birds singing, the park so gay, that I took a leap out of your  balcony, made your deer fly before me like the wind, and chased them all  around the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while you were snoring  in bed, uncle.      Quality.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of  persuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh,  irregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the  plaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow  of words in argumentative style. This difference consists in a variation  in the quality of the voice by which it is adapted to the character of the  thought or sentiment read or spoken. In our attempts to imitate nature,  however, it is important that all affectation be avoided, for perfect  monotony is preferable to this fault. The tones of the voice should be  made to correspond with the nature of the subject, without apparent  effort.      EXAMPLES. (54)    Passion and Grief       \"Come back! come back!\" he cried, in grief,       \"Across this stormy water;     And I'll forgive your Highland chief,       My daughter! O, my daughter!\"      Plaintive       I have lived long enough: my way of life     Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:     And that which should accompany old age,     As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,     I must not look to have.      Calm       A very great portion of this globe is covered     with water, which is called sea, and is very     distinct from rivers and lakes.      Fierce Anger       Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,     And shook his very frame for ire;       And--\"This to me!\" he said,--     \"An 't were not for thy hoary beard,     Such hand as Marmion's had not spared       To cleave the Douglas' head!      Loud and Explosive         \"Even in thy pitch of pride,     Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,       I tell thee, thou 'rt defied!     And if thou said'st I am not peer     To any lord in Scotland here,     Lowland or Highland, far or near,       Lord Angus, thou hast lied!\"        VI. GESTURE. (55)    Gesture is that part of the speaker's manner which pertains to his  attitude, to the use and carriage of his person, and the movement of his  limbs in delivery.    Every person, in beginning to speak, feels the natural embarrassment  resulting from his new position. The novelty of the situation destroys his  self-possession, and, with the loss of that, he becomes awkward, his arms  and hands hang clumsily, and now, for the first time, seem to him worse  than superfluous members. This embarrassment will be overcome gradually,  as the speaker becomes familiar with his position; and it is sometimes  overcome at once, by a powerful exercise of the attention upon the matter  of the speech. When that fills and possesses the mind, the orator is  likely to take the attitude which is becoming, and, at least, easy and  natural, if not graceful.    1st. The first general direction that should be given to the speaker is,  that he should stand erect and firm, and in that posture which gives an  expanded chest and full play to the organs of respiration and utterance.    2d. Let the attitude be such that it can be shifted easily and gracefully.  The student will find, by trial, that no attitude is so favorable to this  end as that in which the weight of the body is thrown upon one leg,  leaving the other free to be advanced or thrown back, as fatigue or the  proper action of delivery may require.    The student who has any regard to grace or elegance, will of course avoid  all the gross faults which are so common among public speakers, such as  resting one foot upon a stool or bench, or throwing the body forward upon  the support of the rostrum.    3d. Next to attitude, come the movements of the person and limbs. In  these, two objects are to be observed, and, if possible, combined, viz.,  propriety and grace. There is expression in the extended arm, the clinched  hand, the open palm, and the smiting of the breast. But let no gesture be  made that is not in harmony with the thought or sentiment uttered; for it  is this harmony which constitutes propriety. As far as possible, let there  be a correspondence between the style of action and the train of thought.  Where the thought flows on calmly, let there be grace and ease in gesture  and action. Where the style is sharp and abrupt, there is propriety in  quick, short, and abrupt gesticulation. Especially avoid that ungraceful  sawing of the air with the arms, into which all ill-regulated fervor  betrays many young speakers.    What is called graceful manner, can only be attained by those who have  some natural advantages of person. So far as it is in the reach of study  or practice, it seems to depend chiefly upon the general cultivation of  manners, implying freedom from all embarrassments, and entire  self-possession. The secret of acquiring a graceful style of gesture,  we apprehend, lies in the habitual practice, not only when speaking but  at all times, of free and graceful movements of the limbs.    There is no limb nor feature which the accomplished speaker will not  employ with effect, in the course of a various and animated delivery. The  arms, however, are the chief reliance of the orator in gesture; and it  will not be amiss to give a hint or two in reference to their proper use."]]]
