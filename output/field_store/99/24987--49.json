Reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel  thyself to be inferior to all.      CHAPTER III    Of the good, peaceable man    First keep thyself in peace, and then shalt thou be able to be a  peacemaker towards others.  A peaceable man doth more good than a  well-learned.  A passionate man turneth even good into evil and  easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all  things into good.  He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of  none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many  suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to  be quiet.  He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth  what it were more expedient for him to do.  He considereth to  what duties others are bound, and neglecteth those to which he is  bound himself.  Therefore be zealous first over thyself, and then  mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour.    2. Thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds,  but thou wilt not accept the excuses of others.  It would be more  just to accuse thyself and excuse thy brother.  If thou wilt that  others bear with thee, bear thou with others.  Behold how far  thou art as yet from the true charity and humility which knows  not how to be angry or indignant against any save self alone.  It is no great thing to mingle with the good and the meek, for  this is naturally pleasing to all, and every one of us willingly  enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who think with us: but to  be able to live peaceably with the hard and perverse, or with the  disorderly, or those who oppose us, this is a great grace and a  thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man.    3. There are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also  with others, and there are who neither have peace nor suffer  others to have peace; they are troublesome to others, but always  more troublesome to themselves.  And there are who hold  themselves in peace, and study to bring others unto peace;  nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life lieth in humble  suffering rather than in not feeling adversities.  He who best  knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace; that man is  conqueror of himself and lord of the world, the friend of Christ,  and the inheritor of heaven.    CHAPTER IV    Of a pure mind and simple intention    By two wings is man lifted above earthly things, even by  simplicity and purity.  Simplicity ought to be in the intention,  purity in the affection.  Simplicity reacheth towards God, purity  apprehendeth Him and tasteth Him.  No good action will be  distasteful to thee if thou be free within from inordinate  affection.  If thou reachest after and seekest, nothing but the  will of God and the benefit of thy neighbour, thou wilt entirely  enjoy inward liberty.  If thine heart were right, then should  every creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine.  There is no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the  goodness of God.    2. If thou wert good and pure within, then wouldst thou look upon  all things without hurt and understand them aright.  A pure heart  seeth the very depths of heaven and hell.  Such as each one is  inwardly, so judgeth he outwardly.  If there is any joy in the  world surely the man of pure heart possesseth it, and if there is  anywhere tribulation and anguish, the evil conscience knoweth it  best.  As iron cast into the fire loseth rust and is made  altogether glowing, so the man who turneth himself altogether  unto God is freed from slothfulness and changed into a new man.    3. When a man beginneth to grow lukewarm, then he feareth a  little labour, and willingly accepteth outward consolation; but  when he beginneth perfectly to conquer himself and to walk  manfully in the way of God, then he counteth as nothing those  things which aforetime seemed to be so grievous unto him.      CHAPTER V    Of self-esteem    We cannot place too little confidence in ourselves, because grace  and understanding are often lacking to us.  Little light is there  within us, and what we have we quickly lose by negligence.  Oftentimes we perceive not how great is our inward blindness.  We  often do ill and excuse it worse.  Sometimes we are moved by  passion and count it zeal; we blame little faults in others and  pass over great faults in ourselves.  Quickly enough we feel and  reckon up what we bear at the hands of others, but we reflect not  how much others are bearing from us.  He who would weigh well and  rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of  another.    2. The spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all  cares; and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth  silence concerning others.  Thou wilt never be spiritually minded  and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men's matters  and take full heed to thyself.  If thou think wholly upon thyself  and upon God, what thou seest out of doors shall move thee  little.  Where art thou when thou art not present to thyself? and  when thou hast overrun all things, what hath it profited thee,  thyself being neglected?  If thou wouldst have peace and true  unity, thou must put aside all other things, and gaze only upon  thyself.    3. Then thou shalt make great progress if thou keep thyself free  from all temporal care.  Thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou  set a value upon any worldly thing.  Let nothing be great,  nothing high, nothing pleasing, nothing acceptable unto thee,  save God Himself or the things of God.  Reckon as altogether vain  whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature.  The soul  that loveth God looketh not to anything that is beneath God.  God  alone is eternal and incomprehensible, filling all things, the  solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart.      CHAPTER VI    Of the joy of a good conscience    The testimony of a good conscience is the glory of a good man.  Have a good conscience and thou shalt ever have joy.  A good  conscience is able to bear exceeding much, and is exceeding  joyful in the midst of adversities; an evil conscience is ever  fearful and unquiet.  Thou shalt rest sweetly if thy heart  condemn thee not.  Never rejoice unless when thou hast done well.  The wicked have never true joy, nor feel internal peace, for  there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.(1)  And if they  say \"we are in peace, there shall no harm happen unto us, and who  shall dare to do us hurt?\" believe them not, for suddenly shall  the wrath of God rise up against them, and their deeds shall be  brought to nought, and their thoughts shall perish.    2. To glory in tribulation is not grievous to him who loveth; for  such glorying is glorying in the Cross of Christ.  Brief is the  glory which is given and received of men.  Sadness always goeth  hand in hand with the glory of the world.  The glory of the good  is in their conscience, and not in the report of men.  The joy of  the upright is from God and in God, and their joy is in the  truth.  He who desireth true and eternal glory careth not for  that which is temporal; and he who seeketh temporal glory, or who  despiseth it from his heart, is proved to bear little love for  that which is heavenly.  He who careth for neither praises nor  reproaches hath great tranquillity of heart.    3. He will easily be contented and filled with peace, whose  conscience is pure.  Thou art none the holier if thou art  praised, nor the viler if thou art reproached.  Thou art what  thou art; and thou canst not be better than God pronounceth thee  to be.  If thou considerest well what thou art inwardly, thou  wilt not care what men will say to thee.  Man looketh on the  outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart:(2) man  looketh on the deed, but God considereth the intent.  It is the  token of a humble spirit always to do well, and to set little by  oneself.  Not to look for consolation from any created thing is a  sign of great purity and inward faithfulness.    4. He that seeketh no outward witness on his own behalf, showeth  plainly that he hath committed himself wholly to God.  For not he  that commendeth himself is approved, as St. Paul saith, but whom  the Lord commendeth.(3)  To walk inwardly with God, and not to be  held by any outer affections, is the state of a spiritual man.    (1) Isaiah lvii. 21.   (2) 1 Samuel xvi. 7.  (3) 2 Corinthians x. 18.      CHAPTER VII    Of loving Jesus above all things    Blessed is he who understandeth what it is to love Jesus, and to  despise himself for Jesus' sake.  He must give up all that he  loveth for his Beloved, for Jesus will be loved alone above all  things.  The love of created things is deceiving and unstable,  but the love of Jesus is faithful and lasting.  He who cleaveth  to created things will fall with their slipperiness; but he who  embraceth Jesus will stand upright for ever.  Love Him and hold  Him for thy friend, for He will not forsake thee when all depart  from thee, nor will he suffer thee to perish at the last.  Thou  must one day be separated from all, whether thou wilt or wilt  not.    2. Cleave thou to Jesus in life and death, and commit thyself  unto His faithfulness, who, when all men fail thee, is alone able  to help thee.  Thy Beloved is such, by nature, that He will  suffer no rival, but alone will possess thy heart, and as a king  will sit upon His own throne.  If thou wouldst learn to put away  from thee every created thing, Jesus would freely take up His  abode with thee.  Thou wilt find all trust little better than  lost which thou hast placed in men, and not in Jesus.  Trust not  nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind, because all flesh is  grass, and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the  field.(1)    3.

The unparalleled  ravages of the plague known as the \"black death,\" not only in England  but on the Continent, affected him so deeply that he was possessed by  the absolute conviction that the wrath of God was upon the land for  the sins of the nation at large, and especially of the Church, and he  began his work as a preacher against the abuses. His first assault was  upon the Mendicant Friars, whom he held up, as did his contemporary,  Chaucer, to the scorn of the world. Then he passed on to the luxury  in which some of the prelates were living, and to their overweening  influence in the Councils of State. Edward III., after a reign of  great splendour, had sunk into dotage. John of Gaunt had been striving  for mastery against the Black Prince, but the latter was dying, July,  1376, and Gaunt was now supreme. He hated good William of Wykeham, who  had possessed enormous influence with the old king, and he was bent  generally on curbing the power of the higher clergy. At this juncture  Wyclif was summoned to appear at St. Paul's to answer for certain  opinions which he had uttered. It is not clear what these opinions  were, further than that they were mainly against clerical powers and  assumptions; questions of doctrine had not yet shaped themselves. He  appeared before the tribunal, but not alone. Gaunt stood by his side.  And here, for a while, the position of parties becomes somewhat  complicated. Gaunt was at this moment very unpopular. The Black Prince  was the favourite hero of the multitude, an unworthy one indeed, as  Dean Kitchin has abundantly shown, but he had won great victories, and  had been handsome and gracious in manners. He was now at the point of  death, and Gaunt was believed to be aiming at the succession, to the  exclusion of the Black Prince's son, and was associated in the popular  mind with the King's mistress, Alice Ferrers, as taking every sort of  mean and wicked advantage of the old man's dotage. Added to this the  Londoners were on the side of their Bishop (Courtenay) in defence,  as they held, of the rights of the City. So on the day of Wyclif's  appearance the cathedral and streets surrounding it were crowded, to  such an extent indeed that Wyclif had much trouble in getting through,  and when Gaunt was seen, accompanied by his large body of retainers, a  wild tumult ensued; the mob attacked Gaunt's noble mansion, the Savoy  Palace, and had not Courtenay intervened, would have burnt it down.  The Black Prince's widow was at her palace at Kennington, with her  son, the future Richard II., and her great influence was able to  pacify the rioters.    Soon came an overwhelming change. The succession of the Black Prince's  son was secured, and then public opinion was directed to the other  question, Wyclif's denunciation of the Papal abuses. Relieved from  Gaunt's partisanship, he sprang at once into unbounded popularity. His  learning, his piety of life, were fully recognised, and the Londoners  were now on his side. He had preached at the very beginning of the  new reign that a great amount of treasure, in the hands of the Pope's  agent, ought not to pass out of England. Archbishop Sudbury summoned  him not to St. Paul's, but to Lambeth. But the favour with which he  was now regarded was so manifest that he was allowed to depart from  the assembly a free man, only with an injunction to keep silence \"lest  he should mislead the ignorant.\" He went back to Lutterworth, where he  occupied himself in preaching and translating the Bible. He died in  1384. A wonderful impetus was, however, given to the spread of his  opinions by the schism in the Papacy which was filling Europe with  horrified amazement.    From that time till the accession of the Tudors, two subjects are  prominent in English history: the spread of Lollardism, _i.e._, the  Wycliffite doctrines, and the Wars of the Roses. Both topics have some  place in the history of Old St. Paul's.    Richard II. on his accession came in great pomp hither, and never  again alive. But his body was shown in the cathedral by his victorious  successor, Henry IV., who had a few days before buried his father,  John of Gaunt, there, who died at Ely House, Holborn, February 3rd,  1399, and whose tomb was one of the finest in the cathedral, as  sumptuous as those of his father, Edward III., at Westminster, and his  son, Henry IV., at Canterbury.    Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the youngest son of Henry IV., was  appointed guardian of his infant nephew, Henry VI., on his father's  death; but partly though the intrigues and squabbles of the royal  family, partly by his own mismanagement, he lost the confidence of the  nation. His wife, Jacqueline, had been persuaded by a sorcerer that  her husband would be king, and she joined him in acts of witchcraft  in order to bring this about. She was condemned (October, 1441) to do  penance by walking three successive days in a white sheet and carrying  a lighted taper, starting each day from St. Paul's and visiting  certain churches. Her husband, says the chronicler Grafton, \"took all  patiently and said little.\" Still retaining some power in the Council,  he lived until 1447, when he died and was buried at St. Albans. He was  an unprincipled man, but a generous patron of letters and a persecutor  of Lollards; and hence, in after years, he got the name of \"the good  Duke Humphrey,\" which was hardly a greater delusion than that which  afterwards identified the tomb of Sir John Beauchamp in St. Paul's as  Duke Humphrey's. But the strange error was accepted, and the aisle in  which the said tomb lay was commonly known as \"Duke Humphrey's Walk,\"  and it was a favourite resort of insolvent debtors and beggars, who  loitered about it dinnerless and in hope of alms. And thus arose  the phrase of \"Dining with Duke Humphrey,\" _i.e._, going without; a  phrase, it will be seen, founded on a strange blunder. The real grave  is on the south side of the shrine of St. Alban's.    Richard, Duke of York, swore fealty in most express terms to Henry VI.  at St. Paul's in March, 1452. He had been suspected of aiming at  the crown. But the government grew so unpopular, partly through the  disasters in France, partly through the King's incapacity, that York  levied an army and demanded \"reformation of the Government.\" And on  May 23rd, 1455, was fought the battle of St. Albans, the first of  twelve pitched battles, the first blood spilt in a fierce contest  which lasted for thirty years, and almost destroyed the ancient  nobility of England. York himself was killed at Wakefield, December  23rd, 1460. On the following 3rd of March his son was proclaimed  King Edward IV. in London, and on the 29th (Palm Sunday) he defeated  Henry's Queen Margaret at Towton, the bloodiest battle ever fought on  English ground. A complicated struggle followed, during which there  was much changing of sides. Once King Henry, who had been imprisoned  in the Tower, was brought out by the Earl of Warwick, who had changed  sides, and conducted to St. Paul's in state. But the Londoners showed  that they had no sympathy; they were on the Yorkist side in the  interest of strong government. Hall the chronicler makes an amusing  remark on Warwick's parading of King Henry in the streets. \"It no more  moved the Londoners,\" he says, \"than the fire painted on the wall  warmed the old woman.\" That is worthy of Sam Weller. In May, 1470,  Henry died in the Tower, and his corpse was exhibited in St. Paul's.  It was alleged that as it lay there blood flowed from the nose as  Richard Crookback entered, witnessing that he was the murderer.  Richard afterwards came again to offer his devotions after the death  of his brother, Edward IV., and all the while he was planning the  murder of his young nephews.    Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VII., married Catharine of  Aragon in St. Paul's, November 14th, 1501. He died five months later,  at the age of 15. The chroniclers are profuse in their descriptions of  the decorations of the cathedral and city on that occasion. The body  of Henry VII. lay in state at St. Paul's before it was buried in  Westminster Abbey.    This brings us to a new epoch altogether in our history. The stirring  events now to be noted do not so much concern the material fabric of  the cathedral as in the past, but they were of the most momentous  interest, and St. Paul's took more part in them than did any other  cathedral.
