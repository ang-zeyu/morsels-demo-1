THE RIG VEDA. THE UPPER GODS.      The hymns of the Rig Veda may be divided into three classes, those in  which are especially lauded the older divinities, those in which  appear as most prominent the sacrificial gods, and those in which a  long-weakened polytheism is giving place to the light of a clearer  pantheism. In each category there are hymns of different age and  quality, for neither did the more ancient with the growth of new  divinities cease to be revered, nor did pantheism inhibit the formal  acknowledgment of the primitive pantheon. The cult once established  persisted, and even when, at a later time, all the gods had been  reduced to nominal fractions of the All-god, their ritualistic  individuality still was preserved. The chief reason for this lies in  the nature of these gods and in the attitude of the worshipper. No  matter how much the cult of later gods might prevail, the other gods,  who represented the daily phenomena of nature, were still visible,  awe-inspiring, divine. The firmest pantheist questioned not the  advisability of propitiating the sun-god, however much he might regard  this god as but a part of one that was greater. Belief in India was  never so philosophical that the believer did not dread the lightning,  and seek to avert it by praying to the special god that wielded it.  But active veneration in later times was extended in fact only to the  strong Powers, while the more passive divinities, although they were  kept as a matter of form in the ceremonial, yet had in reality only  tongue-worshippers.    With some few exceptions, however, it will be found impossible to say  whether any one deity belonged to the first pantheon.    The best one can do is to separate the mass of gods from those that  become the popular gods, and endeavor to learn what was the character  of each, and what were the conceptions of the poets in regard both to  his nature, and to his relations with man. A different grouping of the  gods (that indicated below) will be followed, therefore, in our  exposition.    After what has been said in the introductory chapter concerning the  necessity of distinguishing between good and bad poetry, it may be  regarded as incumbent upon us to seek to make such a division of the  hymns as shall illustrate our words. But we shall not attempt to do  this here, because the distinction between late mechanical and poetic  hymns is either very evident, and it would be superfluous to burden  the pages with the trash contained in the former,[1] or the  distinction is one liable to reversion at the hands of those critics  whose judgment differs from ours, for there are of course some hymns  that to one may seem poetical and to another, artificial. Moreover, we  admit that hymns of true feeling may be composed late as well as  early, while as to beauty of style the chances are that the best  literary production will be found among the latest rather than among  the earliest hymns.    It would, indeed, be admissible, if one had any certainty in regard to  the age of the different parts of the Rig Veda, simply to divide the  hymns into early, middle, and late, as they are sometimes divided in  philological works, but here one rests on the weakest of all supports  for historical judgment, a linguistic and metrical basis, when one is  ignorant alike of what may have been accomplished by imitation, and of  the work of those later priests who remade the poems of their  ancestors.    Best then, because least hazardous, appears to be the method which we  have followed, namely, to take up group by group the most important  deities arranged in the order of their relative importance, and by  studying each to arrive at a fair understanding of the pantheon as a  whole. The Hindus themselves divided their gods into highest, middle,  and lowest, or those of the upper sky, the atmosphere, and the earth.  This division, from the point of view of one who would enter into the  spirit of the seers and at the same time keep in mind the changes to  which that spirit gradually was subjected, is an excellent one. For,  as will be seen, although the earlier order of regard may have been  from below upwards, this order does not apply to the literary  monuments. These show on the contrary a worship which steadily tends  from above earthwards; and the three periods into which may be divided  all Vedic theology are first that of the special worship of sky-gods,  when less attention is paid to others; then that of the atmospheric  and meteorological divinities; and finally that of terrestrial powers,  each later group absorbing, so to speak, the earlier, and therewith  preparing the developing Hindu intelligence for the reception of the  universal god with whom closes the series.    Other factors than those of an inward development undoubtedly were at  work in the formation of this growth. Especially prominent is the  amalgamation of the gods of the lower classes with those of the  priest-hood. Climatic environment, too, conditioned theological  evolution, if not spiritual advance. The cult of the mid-sphere god,  Indra, was partly the result of the changing atmospheric surroundings  of the Hindus as they advanced into India. The storms and the sun were  not those of old. The tempests were more terrific, the display of  divine power was more concentrated in the rage of the elements; while  appreciation of the goodness of the sun became tinged with  apprehension of evil, and he became a deadly power as well as one  beneficent. Then the relief of rain after drought gave to Indra the  character of a benign god as well as of a fearful one. Nor were  lacking in the social condition certain alterations which worked  together with climatic changes. The segregated mass of the original  people, the braves that hung about the king, a warrior-class rapidly  becoming a caste, and politically the most important caste, took the  god of thunder and lightning for their god of battle. The fighting  race naturally exalted to the highest the fighting god. Then came into  prominence the priestly caste, which gradually taught the warrior that  mind was stronger than muscle. But this caste was one of thinkers.  Their divinity was the product of reflection. Indra remained, but  yielded to a higher power, and the god thought out by the priests  became God. Yet it must not be supposed that the cogitative energy of  the Brahman descended upon the people's gods and suddenly produced a  religious revolution. In India no intellectual advance is made  suddenly. The older divinities show one by one the transformation that  they suffered at the hands of theosophic thinkers. Before the  establishment of a general Father-god, and long before that of the  pantheistic All-god, the philosophical leaven was actively at work. It  will be seen operative at once in the case of the sun-god, and,  indeed, there were few of the older divinities that were untouched by  it. It worked silently and at first esoterically. One reads of the  gods' 'secret names,' of secrets in theology, which 'are not to be  revealed,' till at last the disguise is withdrawn, and it is  discovered that all the mystery of former generations has been leading  up to the declaration now made public: 'all these gods are but names  of the One.'      THE SUN-GOD.    The hymn which was translated in the first chapter gives an epitome of  the simpler conceptions voiced in the few whole hymns to the sun. But  there is a lower and a higher view of this god. He is the shining god  _par excellence_, the _deva, s[=u]rya_,[2] the red ball in the sky.  But he is also an active force, the power that wakens, rouses,  enlivens, and as such it is he that gives all good things to mortals  and to gods. As the god that gives life he (with others)[3] is the  author of birth, and is prayed to for children. From above he looks  down upon earth, and as with his one or many steeds "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#9)"],[1,"showed absolutely no sign of bodily disease. He was  admitted to a ward for treatment by hypnotic suggestion, but before  this could be begun he endeavoured to commit suicide by setting fire  to his bed.    A girl of twenty-four years of age had become almost equally  emaciated. Constant vomiting had persisted for many years and had  defied many attempts at cure. It had even been proposed to perform the  operation of gastro-enterostomy in the belief that some organic  disease existed. In suitable surroundings and with the energetic  support of a good nurse, who spent much time and care in restoring her  balance of mind, the vomiting ceased, and she gained over two stones  in weight. Work was found for her in some occupation connected with  the War, and she left the Nursing Home to undertake this, bearing with  her four pounds which she had abstracted from the purse of another  patient.    Those who have not opportunities of observing how all-powerful is the  effect of the mind upon the body, and especially perhaps upon the  process of digestion, may find it hard to believe that these  distressing symptoms and profound changes in the aspect and nutrition  of the patients were due entirely to mental causes and were symptoms  in accord with the attempted suicide or the theft of the money. In  nervous little children we shall not often find such complex actions  as suicide or theft, although they do occur, but combined with other  evidence of nervousness we shall meet commonly enough with a  persistent setting aside of appetite and refusal of food and with  continuous and habitual vomiting, from nervous causes.    The experiments of Pawlow and others have explained the dependence of  digestion upon mental states. They show that even before the food is  taken into the mouth, while the meal is still in prospect, there has  been instituted a series of changes in the wall of the stomach, which  gives rise to the so-called psychic secretion of gastric juice. These  changes are preceded by the sensation of appetite, which is evoked not  by the presence of food in the stomach--for the food has not yet been  swallowed--but by the anticipation of it, by the sight and smell of  food, as well as by more complex suggestions, such as the time of day,  the habitual hour, the approach of home, and so forth.    Emotional states of all sorts--grief, anger, anxiety, or  excitement--put a stop to the process or interfere with its action, so  that the sense of appetite is absent, and the taking of food is apt to  be followed by discomfort or pain or vomiting. No doubt good digestion  leads to a placid mind, but it is equally true that a placid mind is  necessary for good digestion. Therefore we civilised people, living  lives of mental stress and strain, try to increase the suggestive  force of our surroundings and to provoke appetite by all devices  calculated to stimulate the aesthetic sense. The dinner hour is fixed  at a time when all work and, let us hope, all worry is at an end for  the day. The dinner-table is made as pretty as possible, with flowers  and sparkling glass. We are wise to dress for dinner, that with our  working clothes we may put off our working thoughts.    In the treatment of adult dyspepsia we seldom succeed unless we can  place the mind at rest. We may advise a visit to the dentist and a set  of false teeth, or we may administer a variety of stomach tonics and  sedatives, but if the mind remains filled with nameless fears and  anxieties we shall not succeed.    In adult life the nervous person when subjected to excessive stress  and strain is seldom free from dyspeptic symptoms of one sort or  another, and what is true of adult life is even more true of  childhood, when the emotions are more poignant and less controlled.  Then tears flow more readily than in later life, and tears are not the  only secretions which lie under the influence of strong emotion.  Emotional states, which would stamp a grown man as a profound  neurotic, are almost the rule in infancy and childhood, and may be  marked by the same physical disturbances--flushing, sweating, or  pallor, by the discharge of internal glandular secretions as well as  by inhibition of appetite, by vomiting, gastric discomfort, or  diarrhoea. Naturally enough, mothers and nurses are wont to demand a  concrete cause for the constant crying of a little child, and  teething, constipation, the painful passage of water, pain in the  head, or colic and indigestion are suggested in turn, and powders,  purges, or circumcision demanded. There can be no doubt that nervous  unrest is capable of producing prolonged dyspepsia in infancy and  childhood--a dyspepsia which, while it obstinately resists all  attempts to overcome it by manipulation of the diet, is very readily  amenable to treatment directed to quiet the nervous system.    Where a primary dyspepsia exists for any length of time, the growth  and the nutrition of the child is clearly altered for the worse. The  character of the stools, their consistency, smell, and colour, is apt  to be changed because the bacterial context of the bowel has become  abnormal. Rickets, mucous disease, lienteric diarrhoea, infantilism,  prolapse of the rectum, and infection with thread-worms are common  complications. No doubt children with primary dyspepsia are often  nervous and restless, and the elements of infection and of neurosis  are frequently combined. Yet often we meet with cases in which the  gastric or intestinal disturbance comes near to being a pure neurosis.  The nutrition, then, seldom suffers to any very great extent, or to a  degree in any way comparable to that which is characteristic of  dyspepsia from other causes. Emaciation, wrinkling of the skin,  dryness and falling out of the hair, decay of the teeth, are not as a  rule part of the picture of nervous dyspepsia. The child may be slim  and thin and nervous looking, but as a rule he is active enough, with  a good colour and fair muscular tone, so that one has difficulty in  believing the mother's statements, which are yet true enough, as to  the trouble which is experienced in forcing him to eat, or as to the  frequency of vomiting.    In early childhood the difficulty of the refusal of food often passes  or diminishes when the child learns to feed himself with precision and  certainty. To teach him to do so, it is not wise to devote all our  attention to making him adept at this particular task. The fault is  that the brain centres which control the movements of hands, mouth,  and tongue have not been developed, because his activities in all  directions have not been encouraged. It is much less trouble for a  nurse to feed a little child than to teach him to feed himself, and if  he is not given daily opportunities of practice he will certainly not  learn this particular action. But the fault as a rule lies deeper. The  child who cannot feed himself cannot be taught until fingers and brain  have been developed in the thousand activities of his daily routine,  by which he acquires general dexterity. A child who is still too young  to feed himself is learning the dexterity which is necessary as a  preliminary in every action of the day. If he can carry the tablecloth  and the cups and saucers to the tea-table, imitating in everything the  action of his nurse, it will be strange if he does not also imitate  her in the central scene, the actual eating of the food. If, on the  other hand, he is waited upon hand and foot, if he is restrained and  confined, sitting too much passively, now in his perambulator, now in  his high chair, now on his nurse's lap, his imitative faculties and  his tactile dexterity alike remain undeveloped. The child who is slow  in learning to feed himself shows his backward development in every  movement of his body. One may note especially the stiff,  \"expressionless\" hands, indicating a general neuro-muscular defect. I  have seen many children of eighteen months or two years of age in whom  the movements necessary for efficient mastication and swallowing had  failed to develop satisfactorily. In some a pure sucking movement  persisted, so that when, for example, a morsel of bread or rusk was  put in the child's mouth, it would be held there for many minutes and  submitted only to suction with cheeks and tongue. Attempts to swallow  in such a case are so incoordinate that they give rise frequently to  violent fits of choking, which distress the child and produce  resistance and struggling, while at the same time they alarm the  mother or nurse so much that further attempts to encourage the taking  of solid food are hastily and for a long time abandoned. In this  helpless condition the other factors which tend to develop what we  have called negativism have full play. The want of imitation and the  lack of dexterity is not the sole or perhaps the main cause of the  child's refusal of food and of the apparent want of appetite, but it  is the cause of the failure to learn to feed himself, which places  him in a condition which is peculiarly favourable to the operation of  other factors. If only we can teach the child to feed himself, the  difficulties of the situation become much less formidable.    The first of the factors which encourage the persistent refusal of  food is the extreme susceptibility of the child to suggestion. A  particular article of diet may be refused on one occasion, perhaps in  pique, because another more favoured dish was hoped for or expected,  or perhaps because the taste is not yet familiar. Then if on this  occasion a struggle for the mastery is waged, and a painful impression  is made on the child's mind connecting this particular dish with  struggling and tears, from that day forward the child may persistently  refuse it on every occasion it is offered. Matters are made worse if  the nurse, anticipating refusal, attempts to overcome the resistance  by peremptory orders, or by excessive praise"]]]
