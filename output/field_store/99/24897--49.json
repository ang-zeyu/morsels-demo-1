Ghazi - (or Shahab) ud-din attempted  to reproduce the policy of the Sayyids by governing behind this  puppet; but the son of the murdered emperor proclaimed himself in  Bihar (v. inf.), and Ahmad the Abdali moved against Ghazi, as we  shall see in the next chapter. Discretion was the only part of  valour left, and the young and unscrupulous politician fled to  Bhartpur, where he found a temporary asylum with Suraj Mal.    As this restless criminal here closes his public life, it may be  once for all mentioned that he reluctantly and slowly retired to  Farukhabad, where he remained till Shall Alam came there in 1771  (inf. p. 98); that being driven from thence at the Restoration he  once more became a wanderer, and spent the next twenty years of  his life in disguise and total obscurity; till being accidentally  discovered by the British police at Surat, about 1791, he was, by  the Governor-General's orders, allowed to depart with a small sum  of money to Mecca, the refuge of many a Mohamadan malcontent.  Returning thence he visited Kabul, where he joined one of the  Dehli princes in an attempted invasion of India. The prince went  mad at Multan, and Ghazi, leaving him there, went on to  Bandelkhand, where he received a grant of land on which he  chiefly passed the remainder of his days. He died in 1800, and  was buried at Pakpatan in the Panjab (v. Journal of the As. Soc.  of Bengal, No. CCXXVI. 1879, pp. 129, ff.)    The vengeance of the Abdali, therefore, fell upon the unoffending  inhabitants of the capital  once more they were scourged with  fire and sword. Leaving a garrison in the palace, the Abdali then  quitted the almost depopulated city, and fell back on his old  quarters at Anupshahar, where he entered into negotiations with  the Rohillas, and with the Nawab of Audh, of which the result was  a general combination of the Musalmans of Hindustan with a view  of striking a decisive blow in defence of Islam. But these events  will form the subject of a separate chapter.    CHAPTER VI.        The Campaign of Panipat.        THE Mahratta confederacy was in 1759 irresistible from the  borders of Berar to the banks of the Ganges. On one side they  were checked by the Nizam and Haidar, on the other by  Shujaa-ud-daula, the young ruler of Audh. Between these limits  they were practically paramount. To the westward a third  Mohamadan power, the newly-formed Daurani empire, was no doubt a  standing menace; but it is very possible that, with Ahmad Shah,  as with the other Moslem chiefs, arrangements of a pacific nature  might have been made. All turned upon the character and conduct  of one man. That man was Sadasheo Rao, the cousin and minister of  the Mahratta leader, the Peshwa, into whose hands had fallen the  sway of Mahratta power. For their titular head, the descendant of  Sivaji the original founder, was a puppet, almost a prisoner,  such as we, not many years ago, considered the Mikado of Japan.    The state of the country is thus described by a contemporary  historian, quoted by Tod:  \"The people of Hindustan at this  period thought only of personal safety and gratification. Misery  was disregarded by those who escaped it; and man, centred solely  in self, felt not for his kind. This selfishness, destructive of  public, as of private, virtue, became universal in Hindustan  after the invasion of Nadir Shah; nor have the people become more  virtuous since, and consequently are neither happy nor more  independent.\"    Ahmad Khan (known as \"the Abdali\"), whom we are now to recognise  as Ahmad Shah, the Daurani emperor, returned to Hindustan (as  stated in the last chapter) late in the summer, and marched to  Dehli, when he heard of the murder of Alamgir II. The execrable  Shahabuddin (or Ghazi-ud-din the younger) fled at his approach,  taking refuge with the Jats. Mahratta troops, who had occupied  some places of strength in the Panjab, were defeated and driven  in. The capital was again occupied and plundered, after which the  Shah retired to the territory of his ally Najib, and summoned to  his standard the chiefs of the Rohillas. On the other hand the  Mahrattas, inviting to their aid the leaders of the Rajputs and  Jats, moved up from the South. They possessed themselves of the  capital in December 1759.    The main force of the Mahrattas that left the Deccan consisted of  20,000 chosen horse, under the immediate command of the minister,  Sadasheo, whom for convenience we may in future call by his title  of \"the Bhao.\" He also took with him a powerful disciplined corps  of 10,000 men, infantry and artillery, under a Mohamadan soldier  of fortune, named Ibrahim Khan. This general had learned French  discipline as commandant de la qarde to Bussy, and bore the  title, or nickname, of \"gardi,\" a souvenir of his professional  origin.    The Bhao's progress was joined by Mahratta forces under Holkar,  Sindhia, the Gaikwar, Gobind Pant, and others. Many of the Rajput  States contributed, and Suraj Mal brought a contingent of 20,000  hardy Jats. Hinduism was uniting for a grand effort; Islam was  rallied into cohesion by the necessity of resistance. Each party  was earnestly longing for the alliance of the Shias under Shujaa,  Viceroy of Audh, whose antecedents led men on both sides to look  upon them as neutral.    The Bhao had much prestige. Hitherto always victorious, his  personal reputation inspired great respect. His camp, enriched  with the plunder of Hindustan, was on a scale of unwonted  splendour. \"The lofty and spacious tents,\" says Grant-Duff,  \"lined with silks and broadcloths, were surmounted by large  gilded ornaments, conspicuous at a distance..... Vast numbers of  elephants, flags of all descriptions, the finest horses,  magnificently caparisoned .... seemed to be collected from every  quarter .... it was an imitation of the more becoming and  tasteful array of the Moghuls in the zenith of their glory.\" Nor  was this the only innovation. Hitherto the Mahrattas had been  light horsemen, each man carrying his food, forage, bedding, head  and heel ropes, as part of his accoutrements; marching fifty  miles after a defeat, and then halting in complete readiness to  \"fight another day.\" Now, for the first time, they were to be  supported by a regular park of artillery, and a regular force of  drilled infantry. But all these seeming advantages only  precipitated and rendered more complete and terrible their  ultimate overthrow.    Holkar and Suraj Mal, true to the instincts of their old  predatory experience, urged upon the Bhao, that regular warfare  was not the game that they knew. They counselled, therefore, that  the families and tents, and all heavy equipments, should be left  in some strong place of safety, such as the almost impregnable  forts of Jhansi and Gwalior, while their clouds of horse harassed  the enemy and wasted the country before and round him. But the  Bhao rejected these prudent counsels with contempt. He had seen  the effect of discipline and guns in Southern war; and, not  without a shrewd foresight of what was afterwards to be  accomplished by a man then in his train, resolved to try the  effect of scientific soldiership, as he understood it. The  determination proved his ruin; not because the instrument he  chose was not the best, but because it was not complete, and  because he did not know how to handle it. When Madhoji Sindhia,  after a lapse of twenty years, mastered all Asiatic opposition by  the employment of the same instrument, he had a European general,  the Count de Boigne, who was one of the great captains of his  age; and he allowed him to use his own strategy and tactics.  Then, the regular battalions and batteries, becoming the nucleus  of the army, were moved with resolution and aggressive purpose,  while the cavalry only acted for purposes of escort,  reconnoissance, and pursuit. In the fatal campaign before us, we  shall find the disciplined troops doing all that could fairly be  expected of them under Asiatic leaders, but failing for want of  numbers, and of generalship.    On arriving at Dehli, the Bhao surrounded the citadel in which  was situated the palace of the emperors. It was tenanted by a  weak Musalman force, which had been hastily thrown in under the  command of a nephew of Shah Wali Khan, the Daurani Vazir. After a  brief bombardment, this garrison capitulated, and the Bhao took  possession and plundered the last remaining effects of the  emperors, including the silver ceiling of the divan khas, which  was thrown into the melting-pot and furnished seventeen lakhs of  rupees ( £170,000).    Ahmad, in the meantime, was cantoned at Anupshahr, on the  frontier of the Rohilla country, where he was compelled to remain  while his negotiations with Shujaa were pending. So came on the  summer of 1760, and the rainy season was at hand, during which,  in an unbridged country, military operations could not be carried  on. All the more needful that the time of enforced leisure should  be given to preparation. Najib, the head of the Rohillas, was  very urgent with the Shah that Shujaa should be persuaded to take  part against the Mahrattas. He pointed out that, such as the  Moghul empire might be, Shujaa was its Vazir. As Ahmad Shah had  hitherto been foiled by the late Nawab Safdar Jang, it was for  his majesty to judge how useful might be the friendship of a  potentate whose predecessor's hostility had been so formidable.  \"But,\" added the prudent Rohilla, \"it must be remembered that the  recollection of the past will make the Vazir timorous and  suspicious. The negotiation will be as delicate as important. It  should not be entrusted to ordinary agency, or to the impersonal  channel of epistolary correspondence.\"    The Shah approved of these reasonings, and it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#9)"],[1,"the whole race, when, as by slavery, it is  concentrated on a part only, it becomes the double-refined curse of God  upon his creatures.    Free labour has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope. The  power of hope upon human exertion and happiness is wonderful. The  slave-master himself has a conception of it, and hence the system of  tasks among slaves. The slave whom you cannot drive with the lash to  break seventy-five pounds of hemp in a day, if you will task him to  break a hundred, and promise him pay for all he does over, he will break  you a hundred and fifty. You have substituted hope for the rod.    And yet perhaps it does not occur to you that, to the extent of your  gain in the case, you have given up the slave system and adopted the  free system of labour.            _A Fragment on Slavery. July 1854_    If A can prove, however conclusively, that he may of right enslave B,  why may not B snatch the same argument and prove equally that he may  enslave A? You say A is white and B is black. It is colour, then; the  lighter having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule  you are to be slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than  your own.    You do not mean colour exactly? You mean the whites are intellectually  the superiors of the blacks, and therefore have the right to enslave  them? Take care again. By this rule you are to be slave to the first man  you meet with an intellect superior to your own.    But, say you, it is a question of interest, and if you make it your  interest you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can  make it his interest he has the right to enslave you.          _Lincoln's Reply to Senator Douglas at Peoria, Illinois. The Origin of  the Wilmot Proviso. October 16, 1854_      ... Our war with Mexico broke out in 1846. When Congress was about  adjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions  of dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found  practicable and expedient, in negotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico,  and acquiring some part of her territory. A bill was duly gotten up for  the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in the House of  Representatives, when a Democratic member from Pennsylvania by the name  of David Wilmot moved as an amendment, \"Provided, that in any territory  thus acquired there shall never be slavery.\" _This is the origin of the  far-famed Wilmot Proviso._ It created a great flutter; but it stuck like  wax, was voted into the bill, and the bill passed with it through the  House. The Senate, however, adjourned without final action on it, and so  both the appropriation and the proviso were lost for the time.    ... This declared indifference, but, as I must think, real, covert zeal,  for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the  monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our  republican example of its just influence in the world, enables the  enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as  hypocrites, causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity,  and especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into  an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty,  criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is  no right principle of action but self-interest.    Before proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against  the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation.  If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If  it did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I  believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals  on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and  others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of  existence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North  and become tip-top Abolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and  become most cruel slave-masters.    When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin  of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the  institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in  any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I  surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to  do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to  do as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all  the slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a  moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I  think there is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden  execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they  would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus  shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten  days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is  it quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not  hold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for  me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them  politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of  this, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of  whites will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound  judgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it. A  universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely  disregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It does seem to me that  systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their  tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the  South.    Equal justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the  extension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, that inasmuch as  you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not  object to your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly  logical, if there is no difference between hogs and slaves. But while  you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask  whether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as  much? It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world,  only a small percentage are natural tyrants. That percentage is no  larger in the slave States than in the free. The great majority, South  as well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more  divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain.  These sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest in many  ways their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that,  after all, there is humanity in the negro. If they deny this let me  address them a few plain questions.    In 1820 you joined the North almost unanimously in declaring the African  slave-trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death. Why  did you do this? If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join  in providing that men should be hung for it? The practice was no more  than bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them. But  you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses,  wild buffaloes, or wild bears.    Again, you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native  tyrants known as the _slave-dealer_. He watches your necessities, and  crawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price. If you cannot help  it, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you drive him from your  door. You despise him utterly; you do not recognize him as a friend, or  even as an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may  rollick freely with the little negroes, but not with the slave-dealer's  children. If you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get through  the job without so much as touching him. It is common with you to join  hands with the men you meet; but with the slave-dealer you avoid the  ceremony,--instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact. If he grows  rich and retires from business, you still remember him, and still keep  up the ban of non-intercourse upon him and his family. Now, why is this?  You do not so treat the man who deals in cotton, corn, or tobacco.    And yet again. There are in the United States and Territories, including  the District of Columbia, over four hundred and thirty thousand free  blacks. At five hundred dollars per head, they are worth over two  hundred millions of dollars. How comes this vast amount of property to  be running about without owners? We do not see free horses or free  cattle running at large. How is this? All these free blacks are the  descendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves; and they would be  slaves now but for something that has operated on their white owners,  inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them. What is that  something? Is there any mistaking it? In all these cases it is your  sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the  poor negro has some natural right to himself,--that those who deny it  and make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings, contempt, and death.    And now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave, and  estimate him as only the equal of the hog? Why ask us to do what you  will not do yourselves? Why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred  millions of dollars could not induce you to do?    But one great argument in support of the repeal of the Missouri  Compromise is still to come. That argument is \"the sacred right of  self-government.\" ... Some poet has said,--         \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"    At the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I  meet that argument,--I rush in,--I take that bull by the horns."]]]
