Sieglinda, in a transport of exaltation, takes the fragments of the  sword and flies into the forest. Then Wotan comes; the sisters fly in  terror at his command; and he is left alone with Brynhild.    Here, then, we have the first of the inevitable moments which Wotan did  not foresee. Godhead has now established its dominion over the world by  a mighty Church, compelling obedience through its ally the Law, with its  formidable State organization of force of arms and cunning of brain.  It has submitted to this alliance to keep the Plutonic power in  check--built it up primarily for the sake of that soul in itself which  cares only to make the highest better and the best higher; and now here  is that very soul separated from it and working for the destruction  of its indispensable ally, the lawgiving State. How is the rebel to be  disarmed? Slain it cannot be by Godhead, since it is still Godhead's own  very dearest soul. But hidden, stifled, silenced it must be; or it will  wreck the State and leave the Church defenseless. Not until it passes  completely away from Godhead, and is reborn as the soul of the hero,  can it work anything but the confusion and destruction of the existing  order. How is the world to be protected against it in the meantime?  Clearly Loki's help is needed here: it is the Lie that must, on the  highest principles, hide the Truth. Let Loki surround this mountain top  with the appearance of a consuming fire; and who will dare penetrate to  Brynhild? It is true that if any man will walk boldly into that fire,  he will discover it at once to be a lie, an illusion, a mirage through  which he might carry a sack of gunpowder without being a penny the  worse. Therefore let the fire seem so terrible that only the hero, when  in the fulness of time he appears upon earth, will venture through it;  and the problem is solved. Wotan, with a breaking heart, takes leave  of Brynhild; throws her into a deep sleep; covers her with her long  warshield; summons Loki, who comes in the shape of a wall of fire  surrounding the mountain peak; and turns his back on Brynhild for ever.    The allegory here is happily not so glaringly obvious to the younger  generations of our educated classes as it was forty years ago. In those  days, any child who expressed a doubt as to the absolute truth of the  Church's teaching, even to the extent of asking why Joshua told the  sun to stand still instead of telling the earth to cease turning, or of  pointing out that a whale's throat would hardly have been large enough  to swallow Jonah, was unhesitatingly told that if it harboured such  doubts it would spend all eternity after its death in horrible torments  in a lake of burning brimstone. It is difficult to write or read  this nowadays without laughing; yet no doubt millions of ignorant and  credulous people are still teaching their children that. When Wagner  himself was a little child, the fact that hell was a fiction devised for  the intimidation and subjection of the masses, was a well-kept secret of  the thinking and governing classes. At that time the fires of Loki  were a very real terror to all except persons of exceptional force of  character and intrepidity of thought. Even thirty years after Wagner  had printed the verses of The Ring for private circulation, we find  him excusing himself from perfectly explicit denial of current  superstitions, by reminding his readers that it would expose him to  prosecution. In England, so many of our respectable voters are still  grovelling in a gloomy devil worship, of which the fires of Loki are  the main bulwark, that no Government has yet had the conscience or the  courage to repeal our monstrous laws against \"blasphemy.\"          SIEGFRIED    Sieglinda, when she flies into the forest with the hero's son unborn in  her womb, and the broken pieces of his sword in her hand, finds shelter  in the smithy of a dwarf, where she brings forth her child and dies.  This dwarf is no other than Mimmy, the brother of Alberic, the same who  made for him the magic helmet. His aim in life is to gain possession of  the helmet, the ring, and the treasure, and through them to obtain that  Plutonic mastery of the world under the beginnings of which he himself  writhed during Alberic's brief reign. Mimmy is a blinking, shambling,  ancient creature, too weak and timid to dream of taking arms himself to  despoil Fafnir, who still, transformed to a monstrous serpent, broods  on the gold in a hole in the rocks. Mimmy needs the help of a hero for  that; and he has craft enough to know that it is quite possible, and  indeed much in the ordinary way of the world, for senile avarice and  craft to set youth and bravery to work to win empire for it. He knows  the pedigree of the child left on his hands, and nurses it to manhood  with great care.    His pains are too well rewarded for his comfort. The boy Siegfried,  having no god to instruct him in the art of unhappiness, inherits none  of his father's ill luck, and all his father's hardihood. The fear  against which Siegmund set his face like flint, and the woe which he  wore down, are unknown to the son. The father was faithful and grateful:  the son knows no law but his own humor; detests the ugly dwarf who has  nursed him; chafes furiously under his claims for some return for  his tender care; and is, in short, a totally unmoral person, a born  anarchist, the ideal of Bakoonin, an anticipation of the \"overman\" of  Nietzsche. He is enormously strong, full of life and fun, dangerous and  destructive to what he dislikes, and affectionate to what he likes; so  that it is fortunate that his likes and dislikes are sane and healthy.  Altogether an inspiriting young forester, a son of the morning, in whom  the heroic race has come out into the sunshine from the clouds of his  grandfather's majestic entanglements with law, and the night of his  father's tragic struggle with it.    The First Act    Mimmy's smithy is a cave, in which he hides from the light like the  eyeless fish of the American caverns. Before the curtain rises the music  already tells us that we are groping in darkness. When it does rise  Mimmy is in difficulties. He is trying to make a sword for his nursling,  who is now big enough to take the field against Fafnir. Mimmy can make  mischievous swords; but it is not with dwarf made weapons that heroic  man will hew the way of his own will through religions and governments  and plutocracies and all the other devices of the kingdom of the fears  of the unheroic. As fast as Mimmy makes swords, Siegfried Bakoonin  smashes them, and then takes the poor old swordsmith by the scruff of  the neck and chastises him wrathfully. The particular day on which the  curtain rises begins with one of these trying domestic incidents.  Mimmy has just done his best with a new sword of surpassing excellence.  Siegfried returns home in rare spirits with a wild bear, to the extreme  terror of the wretched dwarf. When the bear is dismissed, the new sword  is produced. It is promptly smashed, as usual, with, also, the usual  effects on the temper of Siegfried, who is quite boundless in his  criticisms of the smith's boasted skill, and declares that he would  smash the sword's maker too if he were not too disgusting to be handled.    Mimmy falls back on his stock defence: a string of maudlin reminders of  the care with which he has nursed the little boy into manhood. Siegfried  replies candidly that the strangest thing about all this care is that  instead of making him grateful, it inspires him with a lively desire to  wring the dwarf's neck. Only, he admits that he always comes back to his  Mimmy, though he loathes him more than any living thing in the forest.  On this admission the dwarf attempts to build a theory of filial  instinct. He explains that he is Siegfried's father, and that this is  why Siegfried cannot do without him. But Siegfried has learned from his  forest companions, the birds and foxes and wolves, that mothers as well  as fathers go to the making of children. Mimmy, on the desperate ground  that man is neither bird nor fox, declares that he is Siegfried's father  and mother both. He is promptly denounced as a filthy liar, because  the birds and foxes are exactly like their parents, whereas Siegfried,  having often watched his own image in the water, can testify that he  is no more like Mimmy than a toad is like a trout. Then, to place the  conversation on a plane of entire frankness, he throttles Mimmy until he  is speechless. When the dwarf recovers, he is so daunted that he tells  Siegfried the truth about his birth, and for testimony thereof produces  the pieces of the sword that broke upon Wotan's spear. Siegfried  instantly orders him to repair the sword on pain of an unmerciful  thrashing, and rushes off into the forest, rejoicing in the discovery  that he is no kin of Mimmy's, and need have no more to do with him when  the sword is mended.    Poor Mimmy is now in a worse plight than ever; for he has long ago found  that the sword utterly defies his skill: the steel will yield neither  to his hammer nor to his furnace. Just then there walks into his cave a  Wanderer, in a blue mantle, spear in hand, with one eye concealed by the  brim of his wide hat. Mimmy, not by nature hospitable, tries to drive  him away; but the Wanderer announces himself as a wise man, who can tell  his host, in emergency, what it most concerns him to know. Mimmy, taking  this offer in high dudgeon, because it implies that his visitor's wits  are better than his own, offers to tell the wise one something that HE  does not know: to wit, the way to the door. The imperturbable Wanderer's  reply is to sit down and challenge the dwarf to a trial of wit. He  wagers his head against Mimmy's that he will answer any three questions  the dwarf can put to him.    Now here were Mimmy's opportunity, had he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#9)"],[1,"me.\"    \"Then let us have it, Aunt Phillis. How is that poor creature now?\" asked  her young mistress.    \"Suse, honey? oh, she'll do well 'nuff; don't do her no harm to take some  ob de lazy blood out. Massa Spriggs not so terrible cross, Miss Elsie; but  he bound de work git done, an' Suse she mighty powerful lazy, jes' set in  de sun an' do nuffin' from mornin' to night, ef nobody roun' to make her  work.\"    \"Ah, that is very bad; we must try to reform her in some way. But perhaps  she's not well.\"    \"Dunno, missus; she's always 'plaining ob de misery in her back, an'  misery in her head; but don't ebery one hab a misery, some kind, most  days? an' go on workin' all de same. No, missus, Suse she powerful lazy  ole nigga.\"    With that Phillis retired, and shortly after, tea was announced as ready.    Elsie played the part of hostess to perfection, presiding over the tea-urn  with ease and grace, and pressing upon her father the numerous dainties  with which the table was loaded. She seemed to have recovered her spirits,  and as she sat there gayly chatting--of the room, which pleased her as  entirely as the other, and of her plans for usefulness and pleasure during  her stay, he thought he had never seen her look happier or more beautiful.    \"What rooms have you prepared for your mistress, Aunt Phillis?\" asked Mr.  Dinsmore, as they rose from the table.    \"De same whar she was born, massa, an' whar her dear bressed ma stay when  she livin' heyah.\"    A slight shadow stole over Elsie's bright face. \"That was right,\" she  said, low and softly. \"I should prefer them to any others. But where are  papa's rooms?\"    \"Jes' across de hall, Miss Elsie.\"    \"That is a good arrangement,\" said Mr. Dinsmore. \"Now, daughter, I think  we should repair to the library. It is near the hour you appointed for Mr.  Spriggs.\"    \"Just as handsome, as tastefully, appropriately, and luxuriously furnished  as the others,\" was Elsie's comment on the library. \"I seem to see the  same hand everywhere.\"    \"Yes, and it is the same all over the house,\" replied her father. \"The  books here will delight you; for a private library it is a very fine one,  containing many hundred volumes, as you may see at a glance; standard  works on history, and the arts and sciences, biographies, travels, works  of reference, the works of the best poets, novelists, etc.\"    \"Ah, how we will enjoy them while here! But it seems a sad pity they  should have lain on those shelves unused for so many years.\"    \"Not entirely, my child; I have enjoyed them in my brief visits to the  plantation, and have always allowed the overseer free access to them, on  the single condition that they should be handled with care, and each  returned promptly to its proper place when done with. But come, take this  easy chair by this table; here are some fine engravings I want you to look  at.\"    Elsie obeyed, but had scarcely seated herself when the door was thrown  open and a servant's voice announced, \"Massa Spriggs, Massa Dinsmore and  Miss Elsie.\"    Spriggs, a tall, broad-shouldered, powerfully-built man, with dark hair  and beard and a small, keen black eye, came forward with a bold free air  and a \"Good-even', miss, good-even', sir;\" adding, as he helped himself to  a seat without waiting for an invitation, \"Well, here I am, and I s'pose  you've somethin' to say or you wouldn't have appointed the meetin'.\"    \"Yes, Mr. Spriggs,\" said Elsie, folding her pretty hands in her lap and  looking steadily and coldly into his brazen face, \"I have this to say;  that I entirely disapprove of flogging, and will have none of it on the  estate. I hope you understand me.\"    \"That's plain English and easy understood, Miss Dinsmore, and Dinsmore,  and of course you have a right to dictate in the matter; but I tell you  what, these darkies o' yours are a dreadful lazy set, specially that Suse;  and it's mighty hard for folks that's been used to seein' things done up  spick and span and smart to put up with it.\"    \"But some amount of patience with the natural slowness of the negro is a  necessary trait in the character of an overseer who wishes to remain in my  employ.\"    \"Well, miss, I always calculate to do the very best I can by my employers,  and when you come to look round the estate, I guess you'll find things in  prime order; but I couldn't ha' done it without lettin' the darkies know  they'd got to toe the mark right straight.\"    \"They must attend to the work, of course, and if they won't do so  willingly, must under compulsion; but there are milder measures than this  brutal flogging.\"    \"What do you prescribe, Miss Dinsmore?\"    \"Deprive them of some privilege, or lock them up on bread and water for a  few days,\" Elsie answered; then turned an appealing look upon her father,  who had as yet played the part of a mere listener.    \"I have never allowed any flogging on my estate,\" he observed, addressing  Spriggs, \"and I cannot think it at all necessary.\"    There was a moment of silence, Spriggs sitting looking into the fire, a  half-smile playing about his lips; then turning to Elsie, \"I thought,  miss, you'd a mind this evening to dismiss me on the spot,\" he remarked  inquiringly.    She flushed slightly, but replied with dignity, \"If you will comply with  my directions, sir, pledging yourself never again to be so cruel, I have  no desire to dismiss you from my service.\"    \"All right then, miss. I promise, and shall still do the best I can for  your interests; but if they suffer because I'm forbidden to use the lash,  please remember it's not my fault.\"    \"I am willing to take the risk,\" she answered, intimating with a motion of  her hand that she considered the interview at an end; whereupon he rose  and bowed himself out.    \"Now, papa, for our tour of inspection,\" she cried gayly, rising as she  spoke, and ringing for a servant to carry the light. \"But first please  tell me if I was sufficiently moderate.\"    \"You did very well,\" he answered, smiling. \"You take to the role of  mistress much more naturally than I expected.\"    \"Yet it does seem very odd to me to be giving orders while you sit by a  mere looker-on. But, dear papa, please remember I am still your own child,  and ready to submit to your authority, whenever you see fit to exert it.\"    \"I know it, my darling,\" he said, passing an arm about her waist, as they  stood together in front of the fire, and gazing fondly down into the sweet  fair face.    Aunt Chloe answered the bell, bringing a lamp in her hand.    \"That is right, mammy,\" Elsie said. \"Now lead the way over the house.\"    As they passed from room to room, and from one spacious hall or corridor  to another, Elsie expressed her entire satisfaction with them and their  appointments, and accorded to Aunt Phillis the meed of praise due her  careful housekeeping.    \"And here, my darling,\" Mr. Dinsmore said at length, leading the way  through a beautiful boudoir and dressing-room into an equally elegant and  attractive bedroom beyond, \"they tell me you were born, and your beloved  mother passed from earth to heaven.\"    \"An' eberyting in de room stands jees' as dey did den, honey,\" said Aunt  Chloe. And approaching the bed, her eyes swimming in tears, and laying her  hand upon the pillow, \"jes' here my precious young missus lie, wid cheeks  'mos' as white as de linen, an' eyes so big an' bright, an' de lubly curls  streamin' all roun', an' she say, weak an' low, 'Mammy, bring me my baby.'  Den I put you in her arms, darlin', an' she kiss you all ober your tiny  face, an' de tears an' sobs come fast while she say, 'Poor little baby; no  fader no mudder to lub her! nobody but you, mammy; take her an' bring her  up to lub de dear Lord Jesus.'\"    Silent tears rolled down Elsie's cheeks as she looked and listened; but  her father drew her to his breast and kissed them away, his own eyes  brimming, his heart too full for speech.    Presently he led her back to the boudoir, and showed her the portraits of  her maternal grandparents, and one of her mother, taken at ten or twelve  years of age.    \"What a lovely little girl she was,\" murmured Elsie, gazing lovingly upon  it.    \"Very much like what her daughter was at the same age,\" he answered. \"But  come, this, too, will interest you.\" And lifting the lid of a dainty  work-basket, he pointed to a bit of embroidery, in which the needle was  still sticking, as though it had been laid down by the deft fingers but a  few moments ago.    Elsie caught it up and kissed it, thinking of the touch of those dear dead  fingers, that seemed to linger over it yet.          CHAPTER SEVENTH.                            \"She was the pride      Of her familiar sphere, the daily joy      Of all who on her gracefulness might gaze,      And in the light and music of her way      Have a companion's portrait,\"                         --WILLIS' POEMS.      Elsie had fallen asleep thinking of the dear mother whose wealth she  inherited, and whose place she was now filling; thinking of her as  supremely blest, in that glorious, happy land, where sin and sorrow are  unknown. Thinking, too, of Him, through whose shed blood she had found  admittance there.    The same sweet thoughts were still in the loving daughter's mind, as she  woke to find the morning sun shining brightly, a fire blazing cheerily on  the hearth, and Aunt Chloe coming in with a silver waiter filled with  oranges prepared for eating in the manner usual in the tropics.    She had gathered them the night before, taken off the peel, leaving the  thick white skin underneath except on the top of each, where she cut it  away from a spot about the size of a silver quarter of a dollar. She then  placed them on a waiter, with the cut part uppermost, and set them where  the dew would fall on them all night. Morning found them with the skin  hard and leathery, but filled with delicious juice, which could be readily  withdrawn from it.    At that sight, a sudden memory seemed"]]]
