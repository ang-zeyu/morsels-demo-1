Rub a hind-quarter with saltpetre and common salt, let it lie ten days,  then boil it, and put either carrots or parsnips under it.           *       *       *       *       *    SHOTE'S HEAD.    Take out the brains, and boil the head till quite tender, cut the heart  and liver from the harslet, and boil the feet with the head; cut all the  meat from the head in small pieces, mince the tongue and chop the brains  small, take some of the water the head was boiled in, season it with  onion, parsley and thyme, all chopped fine, add any kind of  catsup--thicken it with butter and brown flour, stew the whole in it  fifteen minutes, and put it in the dish: have the heart roasted to put  in the middle, lay the broiled liver around, and garnish it with green  pickle.           *       *       *       *       *    LEG OF PORK WITH PEASE PUDDING.    Boil a small leg of pork that has been sufficiently salted, score the  top and serve it up; the pudding must be in a separate dish; get small  delicate pease, wash them well, and tie them in a cloth, allowing a  little room for swelling, boil them with the pork, then mash and season  them, tie them up again and finish boiling it; take care not to break  the pudding in turning it out.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED CHINE.    Take the neck chine, rub it well with salt, lay it in a pan, put it in a  pint of water, and fill it up with sweet potatos nicely washed, but not  peeled, cover it close and bake it till done; serve it up with the  potatos, put a little of the gravy in the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO TOAST A HAM.    Boil it well, take off the skin, and cover the top thickly with bread  crumbs, put it in an oven to brown, and serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STUFF A HAM.    Take a well smoked ham, wash it very clean, make incisions all over the  top two inches deep, stuff them quite full with parsley chopped small  and some pepper, boil the ham sufficiently; do not take off the skin. It  must be eaten cold.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUSED FEET IN RAGOUT.    Split the feet in two, dredge them with flour and fry them a nice brown;  have some well seasoned gravy thickened with brown flour and butter;  stew the feet in it a few minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SAUSAGES.    Take the tender pieces of fresh pork, chop them exceedingly fine--chop  some of the leaf fat, and put them together in the proportion of three  pounds of pork to one of fat, season it very high with pepper and salt,  add a small quantity of dried sage rubbed to a powder, have the skins  nicely prepared, fill them and hang them in a dry place. Sausages are  excellent made into cakes and fried, but will not keep so well as in  skins.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE BLACK PUDDINGS.    Catch the blood as it runs from the hog, stir it continually till cold  to prevent its coagulating; when cold thicken it with boiled rice or  oatmeal, add leaf fat chopped small, pepper, salt, and any herbs that  are liked, fill the skins and smoke them two or three days; they must be  boiled before they are hung up, and prick them with a fork to keep them  from bursting.           *       *       *       *       *    A SEA PIE.    Lay at the bottom of a small Dutch oven some slices of boiled pork or  salt beef, then potatos and onions cut in slices, salt, pepper, thyme  and parsley shred fine, some crackers soaked, and a layer of fowls cut  up, or slices of veal; cover them with a paste not too rich, put another  layer of each article, and cover them with paste until the oven is full;  put a little butter between each layer, pour in water till it reaches  the top crust, to which you must add wine, catsup of any kind you  please, and some pounded cloves; let it stew until there is just gravy  enough left; serve it in a deep dish and pour the gravy on.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE PASTE FOR THE PIE.    Pour half a pound of butter or dripping, boiling hot, into a quart of  flour, add as much water as will make it a paste, work it and roll it  well before you use it. It is quite a savoury paste.           *       *       *       *       *    BOLOGNA SAUSAGES.    Take one pound of bacon--fat and lean, one ditto veal, do., pork, do.,  suet, chop all fine, season highly: fill the skins, prick and boil them  an hour, and hang them to dry--grated bread or boiled rice may be added:  clean the skins with salt and vinegar.           *       *       *       *       *      FISH.      TO CURE HERRINGS.    The best method for preserving herrings, and which may be followed with  ease, for a small family, is to take the brine left of your winter stock  for beef, to the fishing place, and when the seine is hauled, to pick  out the largest herrings, and throw them alive into the brine; let them  remain twenty-four hours, take them out and lay them on sloping planks,  that the brine may drain off; have a tight barrel, put some coarse alum  salt at the bottom, then put in a layer of herrings--take care not to  bruise them; sprinkle over it alum salt and some saltpetre, then fish,  salt, and saltpetre, till the barrel is full; keep a board over it.  Should they not make brine enough to cover them in a few weeks, you must  add some, for they will be rusty if not kept under brine. The proper  time to salt them is when they are quite fat: the scales will adhere  closely to a lean herring, but will be loose on a fat one--the former is  not fit to be eaten. Do not be sparing of salt when you put them up.  When they are to be used, take a few out of brine, soak them an hour or  two, scale them nicely, pull off the gills, and the only entrail they  have will come with them; wash them clean and hang them up to dry. When  to be broiled, take half a sheet of white paper, rub it over with  butter, put the herring in, double the edges securely, and broil without  burning it. The brine the herrings drink before they die, has a  wonderful effect in preserving their juices: when one or two years old,  they are equal to anchovies.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BAKE STURGEON.    Get a piece of sturgeon with the skin on, the piece next to the tail,  scrape it well, cut out the gristle, and boil it about twenty minutes to  take out the oil; take it up, pull off the large scales, and when cold,  stuff it with forcemeat, made of bread crumbs, butter, chopped parsley,  pepper and salt, put it in a Dutch oven just large enough to hold it,  with a pint and a half of water, a gill of red wine, one of mushroom  catsup, some salt and pepper, stew it gently till the gravy is reduced  to the quantity necessary to pour over it; take up your sturgeon  carefully, thicken the gravy with a spoonful of butter rubbed into a  large one of brown flour;--see that it is perfectly smooth when you put  it in the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE STURGEON CUTLETS.    The tail piece is the best; skin it and cut off the gristle, cut it into  slices about half an inch thick, sprinkle over them pepper and salt,  dredge them with flour, and fry them a nice light brown; have ready a  pint of good gravy, seasoned with catsup, wine, and a little pounded  cloves, and thickened with brown flour and butter; when the cutlets are  cold, put them into the gravy and stew them a few minutes; garnish the  dish with nice forcemeat balls and parsley fried crisp.           *       *       *       *       *    STURGEON STEAKS.    Cut them as for the cutlets, dredge them, and fry them nicely; dish them  quickly lest they get cold; pour over melted butter with chopped  parsley, and garnish with fried parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL STURGEON.    Leave the skin on, which must be nicely scraped, take out the gristle,  rub it with salt, and let it lie an hour, then put it on in cold water  with some salt and a few cloves of garlic; it must be dredged with flour  before it is put into the water, skim it carefully, and when dished,  pour over it melted butter with chopped parsley, a large spoonful of  mushroom catsup, one of lemon pickle, and one of pepper vinegar; send  some of it to table in a sauce boat;--the sturgeon being a dry fish,  rich sauce is necessary.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BAKE A SHAD.    The shad is a very indifferent fish unless it be large and fat; when you  get a good one, prepare it nicely, put some forcemeat inside, and lay it  at full length in a pan with a pint of water, a gill of red wine, one of  mushroom catsup, a little pepper, vinegar, salt, a few cloves of garlic,  and six cloves: stew it gently till the gravy is sufficiently reduced;  there should always be a fish-slice with holes to lay the fish on, for  the convenience of dishing without breaking it; when the fish is taken  up, slip it carefully into the dish; thicken the gravy with butter and  brown flour, and pour over it.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL A SHAD.    Get a nice fat shad, fresh from the water, that the skin may not crack  in boiling, put it in cold water on a slice, in a kettle of proper  length, with a wine glass of pale vinegar, salt, a little garlic, and a  bundle of parsley; when it is done, drain all the water from the fish,  lay it in the dish, and garnish with scraped horse-radish; have a sauce  boat of nice melted butter, to mix with the different catsups, as taste  shall direct.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST A SHAD.    Fill the cavity with good forcemeat, sew it up, and tie it on a board of  proper size, cover it with bread crumbs, with some salt and pepper, set  it before the fire to roast; when done on one side, turn it, tie it  again, and when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#9)"],[1," with the  extreme heat of the sun, and the noxious insects which are extracted by its  rays from the swamps and woods, renders this navigation intolerably  oppressive. The chief part of its trade is in slaves, camwood, and ivory,  the latter, however, being small, although Port Logo commands a very  extensive back country. When we came near the town of Port Logo, which is  extremely difficult of approach at low water, we announced our visit by  saluting in the manner of this country, which is what they call bush  firing, or in other words is a continued irregular firing of musquetry.    It was soon discovered who we were, and crowds of natives flocked down from  the upper town, which is situated on the declivity of a hill, to give us  service, or to pay their respects. Our first visit was to _Marriba_, one of  Alimami's head men, and a resident of what they consider the lower town.    Upon our arrival at Marriba's house, we found him at his devotions in the  palaver-house, a shed under which the natives daily assemble to pray, or  discuss public affairs. He received us with every demonstration of regard,  and immediately offered his services to conduct us to Alimami. The old  chief preceded us, with his long gold-headed cane, and our rear was brought  up by a number of armed men, who had assembled to give us a favourable  reception. Our salute had pleased Alimami, and being before known to him,  he was determined to shew us every respect. The heat of the sun was almost  intolerable, and before we arrived at the top of the hill where the  imperial palace stood, I was nearly exhausted. The entrance to this large  square of irregular mud buildings, is through a narrow passage or gate,  forming an oblong square of mud, covered with thatch, and facing Alimami's  house: we were ushered through this by one of his head men, and proceeded  in the order we set out to Alimami, who was seated at the top of the  square, surrounded by his chiefs, upon a mat spread upon a raised bank of  mud, dressed in a turban, after the Turkish fashion, and a loose manding,  robe, or shirt.    Several pleaders were haranguing two of his judges, who were seated at a  distance, in palaver, or council, to take cognizance of a dispute relative  to some slaves; and although our arrival had excited the-curiosity of every  inhabitant of the town, yet we passed the tribunal without interruption,  their attention being absorbed on the subject of their sitting. The whole  compass of the square was scarcely equal to contain their oratory, their  voices being so extremely loud as to be heard distinctly, without the  walls, accompanied by menacing attitudes. Passing this declamatory  assembly, we paid our obeisance to Alimami, who was graciously pleased to  receive us in the manner of his country, with great civilities, and  immediately spread mats for us with his own hands, near himself. It was  impossible, although accustomed to these people, to contemplate the  surrounding objects without interest. I had previously been acquainted with  this chief at Bance Island, where he was in a high degree restrained by  European manners; but here, every thing was native and original. All came  to give us service, which is performed as I have mentioned. A goat and a  couple of fowls were next presented for our dinners, for which an offering  more valuable was expected, and of course complied with. This mutual  interchange of civilities being fulfilled, our attention was excited by the  orators, who by this time were extremely clamorous; one of them, with an  aspect the most furious, ran up to where I was seated, and addressing  Alimami, said, \"that as proof his palaver be good, white man come to give  him service while he address him on the subject of his demand;\" attaching  to that circumstance, the superstitious idea that he was right, and that I  was his _fetish_ to establish that right.    I then enquired of Alimami the nature of the trial; he replied, \"these men  tell their story, I appoint two judges to hear them, who are to report to  me what they say, and their opinions of the matter, but I hear all that  already and they cannot tell me wrong: I then give judgment,\" Or in other  words more expressive of his meaning; these men make their complaint to my  head men, or the judges I have appointed to hear it; it is their business  to make me a true report, and give me their opinion on the merits of the  case; and although I am not now supposed to hear it, yet I am so situated  as to hear the whole, and can thereby check any corrupt practices in the  judges.    I had now leisure to examine the interior of Alimami's residence; it  consisted of a square of irregular buildings, thatched with bamboo, and  covered with roofs, supported by pillars of wood, at about 6 feet distance,  projecting about the same number of feet beyond the skeleton of the fabric,  and forming a kind of palisado, which serves as a shade for retirement from  the heat of the sun, and under which, the inhabitants indulge in repose, or  sit in familiar intercourse.    During my conversation with Alimami, his brother, a fat jolly fellow, was  reposing himself upon his mat, reading his Arabic prayer book, which, upon  examination, I found executed in a neat character, and from his  interpretation, was a record of fabulous anecdotes of his family, and  containing confused extracts from the Koran.    The Mandingos are professed Mahomedans, whose influence is spreading with  so much rapidity on this part of the coast, that several of the other  tribes have submitted to their authority; so strong an impression has their  superior attainments and book-knowledge imprinted on their minds. In no  instance can their growing influence appear more conspicuous than in that  of Alimami being vested with authority over the Port Logo, of which he is  not a native, and over a people originally infidels. Formerly this tribe of  Mandingos were itinerant _fetish_ makers and priests, but now they are  numerous to the northward of Sierra Leone, from whence a wide district  receives their rulers and chieftains.    After an audience of considerable length, Alimami retired with several of  his chiefs, and soon after I had a message that he wished to see me in  another part of his dwelling. I had previously noticed to him that I  intended shortly to embark for my country. When conducted to his presence,  he very emphatically enquired \"if what I tell him be true?\" I replied \"it  was; but that I go to do him and his countrymen good; that he know this was  the second time I look them, but never forget them.\" \"We all know that,\" he  replied, \"but white man that come among us, never stay long time; you be  good man, and we wish you live among us--How many moon you be gone from  us?\"--\"About  ten moon; how would you like to go with me, Alimami?\"--\"I  like that much, but black man not be head enough to do what white man  does;\" and putting his hand to his bosom, he took from it a piece of gold  in the form of a heart; and said, \"take that for me.\" To have refused it  would have been an insult; I therefore accepted it; adding, \"that I would  tie it to fine riband, and wear it when I look my country, to let  Englishmen see what fine present he make me.\" He was quite pleased with the  idea, and expressed his satisfaction with great fervency.    Soon after, I offered to take my leave, and was accompanied by him and his  chiefs to the gate, where I bade him adieu, and passed through the town,  paying my respects to its inhabitants, and among others, to the  schoolmaster, whose venerable appearance, and superior intelligence,  excited my respect and esteem.    Upon our return to Marriba's house, we were happy to partake of a country  mess of rice, boiled with fowls, palm oil, and other compounds. The chief  could not be prevailed to eat with us, but attended us with great assiduity  during our meal. The imperial guard accompanied us to our canoe, and we  returned to Miffare without accident.    The following morning we proceeded to the branch of the Rochell, which we  found more diversified and picturesque than the Port Logo, and its borders  better inhabited.    Proceeding up this branch, and visiting the chiefs in our way, and the  inhabitants of a number of villages, we arrived at Billy Manshu's Town, a  little chief of very considerable intelligence, and who treated us with  great hospitality: here we slept.    We arose early, and pursued our course up the branch, passing one of the  most regular built towns I have observed in Africa, now Morrey Samba's, but  formerly Morrey Bunda's Town. Morrey Bunda was originally a Manding, and  _fetish_ maker to Smart, the chief who commands an extensive country on  that side of the Rochell branch towards the Sherbro, and rose into notice  and influence: he is now dead. The town is surrounded by a mud wall, and at  the entrance, and upon each angle of the oblong square which encloses it,  there are towers erected for the purposes of defence. The wall, with the  towers, completely obscures the buildings which form the town, and serve as  a guard against any depredations of enemies, while it shelters the  inhabitants from the effects of their arrows or musquetry. Morrey Bunda has  displayed in his plans of fortifications, considerable ingenuity,  considering the circumstances he had to provide against, and the predatory  nature of African wars, which are uniformly to surprise the inhabitants of  a village or town while asleep, or in any other unguarded state, seldom or  ever coming to a general engagement in the open country, but acting under  the protection of some ambush, or other place of security, which, while it  is calculated to conceal their numbers, serves as a retreat from their  successful opponents.    Leaving Morrey Samba's we passed by a number of other villages, until we  arrived at one of Smart's trading towns, called Mahera, situated upon an  eminence, and commanding a"]]]
