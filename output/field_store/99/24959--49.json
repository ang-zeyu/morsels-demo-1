[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],[0,"The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#9)"],[1," straight line 10 feet long.  Now, I'll set the surveying instrument with the plumb-bob right over the  end of this line, and sight through the two sight holes until I bring  the two vertical hairs in line with each other and the tree. Look at the  compass needle. It points to the 173 degree mark on the cardboard ring.  Now, Bill, you hold the rod at the other end of our base line while I  swing this instrument around and sight it. There, the needle points to  92 degrees, and subtracting this from 173 the difference, 81 degrees, is  the angle at the right end of our base line. We'll do the same thing at  the other end of our line. See, the compass needle points to 189  degrees, and now sighting to the pole at the other end of the line we  find that the needle points to 268. The difference, 79 degrees, is  therefore the size of the angle at the left end of our base line. Now we  will draw this out on paper, as we did our first triangle, using  quarter-inches to represent feet. Our base line was 10 feet long, and we  will therefore draw a line 10 quarter-inches, or 2-1/2 inches long, on  our drawing board. On this line we will construct the triangle, using  the angles 81 and 79 degrees. There, that's how our triangle looks, and  the right hand side measures 7-1/4 inches, while the left hand side  measures 7-5/16 inches. That is, 29 quarter-inches for one side and  29-1/4 quarter-inches for the other. As each quarter-inch represents a  foot, you will find that the tree is about 29 feet from the right end of  our base line and 29 feet 3 inches from the left hand end. Of course,  our instrument is not perfect, neither is our drawing; but if you  measure it off with the chain you will see that I am not very far from  correct.\"      MAPPING THE ISLAND.    Most of our surveying was done by actual measurement, the surveying  instrument being used only to determine the exact direction of the  measurement. However, there were some measurements which we could not  make directly with the chain. For example, we wished to know just how  far it was from our tent to the Jersey shore of the river. We measured  off a base line along our shore 400 feet long and sighted to a point  directly across the river from our tent. The angle in front of our tent  was 90 degrees, and at the other end of the base line was 73 degrees.  When we drew out our triangle on the scale of 100 feet to the inch we  found that the shorter side directly in front of the tent was almost  exactly 13 inches long. This meant that the river at this point was  1,300 feet wide, nearly a quarter of a mile. On the other side of the  island we found, in the same way, that the river at its narrowest point  was about 500 feet wide. This portion of the river we named Lake Placid,  as the water was very still and quite deep. This was due to a sort of  natural dam formed at the lower end of our island. The small island that  Dutchy found was kite-shaped, with a tail of boulders which extended  almost all the way across to a rocky point on the Pennsylvania shore.  The channel between \"Kite Island,\" as we called it, and Willow Clump  Island was not more than fifteen feet wide in some places, and through  this the water swept with a swift current down past a narrow neck of  land to join the main current. This narrow stretch of land we named the  Tiger's Tail, owing to its peculiar shape. It was in the hook at the end  of this tail that we discovered the old bridge wreck above referred to.  From the tip of the Tiger's Tail to Point Lookout, at the extreme upper  end of Willow Clump Island, it was a little under a half-mile. The shore  all along Lake Placid was very steep, except near Point Lookout. At one  place there was a shallow bay which we called the lagoon.          CHAPTER VIII.    SWIMMING.      [Illustration: Fig. 85. The Diving Tree.]    Lake Placid was a favorite swimming place for us. We used to plunge in  from the branches of a tree which overhung the water a little ways above  the lagoon and made a natural springboard. We could all swim like ducks,  except Dutchy, who couldn't do anything but paddle. However, Uncle Ed  was an expert, and he took Dutchy in hand and soon made a pretty good  swimmer out of him. He also taught us some fancy strokes. Of course I  took no record of these lessons. You would hardly expect me to sit on  the bank with a book in hand jotting down notes while the rest were  splashing around in the cool water having the best of fun in the world,  and even if I had, I wouldn't republish the notes here, because whoever  heard of a boy learning to swim while reading a book on the subject? A  beginner had better leave books alone and plunge right into the water.  He will soon learn to keep himself afloat and can then practise any  fancy strokes that he sees others try. Then, again, don't try to learn  in shallow water, because you will never do it. Of course it doesn't pay  to jump into water that is over your head unless there is a good swimmer  near by to help you out. But you will never learn to swim until you have  become accustomed to putting your head under water. You can not swim  with a dry face. The first time we went swimming, we couldn't persuade  Dutchy to try it. The water was deep right up to the very bank and he  had never been in over his head. Instead he sat up in the diving tree  swinging his feet and trying to hide the fact that he was having a dull  time.    \"Say, we've got to douse that fellow,\" said Reddy.    \"You're right; he needs a wash,\" said Jim. \"Let's sneak up behind him  and chuck him in.\"    They landed a little ways up the stream behind a large bush and then  crept down stealthily on their victim. But Dutchy had his suspicions  aroused and saw them coming. He scrambled out of the tree in a jiffy and  tore off into the woods as fast as his legs could carry him.      SWIMMING ON A PLANK.    [Illustration: Fig. 86. Swimming on a Plank.]    We didn't expect to see him again that afternoon, for the pace he was  leading should have carried him miles in no time; but while he couldn't  swim, Dutchy had his own ideas of fun on the water. It was about twenty  minutes later that we saw him coming down-stream lying full length on  one of the 2-inch planks taken from the bridge wreck. He was paddling  himself along with arms and legs hung over the sides of the plank. We  all gave him a cheer, and then started out to have some fun with him. We  tried to pull him off his raft, but he stuck on like a leech. It was  only when we made his craft turn turtle that Dutchy got his head under  water. But it wasn't a moment before he scrambled back on top again,  gasping and sputtering to get the water out of his nose and mouth.    Uncle Ed all this time had been sunning himself on the bank, when  suddenly he uttered a shout of warning. We were right at the mouth of  the mill-race. For the moment we forgot about Dutchy, and swam out for  shore. Before we realized it Dutchy was caught in the current, and was  being swept full tilt down the stream. My but wasn't he scared. I can  see him yet clinging for dear life to the plank, his face the color of  ashes and his eyes bulging out in terror. First he tried to make for the  bank, but the water was so swift that when the front end of the board  struck land the rear end swung around in a circle, carrying him on  again, but backward this time, before we could reach him. Two or three  more times the plank struck the bank and turned him around, while we  raced along the high bank, scrambling down to catch him every time he  headed for shore, but each time just missing him. Then he swung out past  the Tiger's Tail into the open river just above the rapids. Fortunately  he was going along headforemost this time, and Uncle Ed, who had just  arrived, panting and breathless, from running, shouted to him to keep  his head and steer for a narrow opening between two jutting boulders. I  don't know whether Dutchy did any steering or not, but the raft shot  straight through the opening, and was lost in a cloud of spray. In a  moment he reappeared below the rapids, paddling like mad for a neck of  land on the Pennsylvania side of the river.    Dutchy would never own up that he was afraid. He never told a lie under  other circumstances, but when it came to a question of courage he had  the habit of stretching facts to the very limit. Even in this case, he  said that he started out with the idea of shooting the rapids, and if we  hadn't flustered him so, he would not have bumped into the bank and  turned about so many times. Dutchy was a very glib talker. He nearly  persuaded us that it was all done intentionally, and his thrilling  account of the wild dash between the rocks and through the shower of  spray stirred us up so that we all had to try the trick too.      SHOOTING THE RAPIDS.    The next day, while Uncle Ed was taking a nap, we stole off to the upper  end of Lake Placid, each one towing a plank. We needn't have been so  afraid of Uncle Ed, for we found out later that he intended to try a  plank ride through the rapids himself next time he went in swimming.  Down Lake Placid we paddled in single column to the mill-race. In a  moment the current had caught us and we were off. I shall never forget  the thrilling ride down the swirling mill-race, the sudden pause as we  shot out into the open river, the plunge between the boulders and the  dive through the spray. It was all over too soon. Something like  coasting--whiz, whiz-z-z, and a half-mile walk. Were it not for the  trouble of hauling the planks back by the roundabout course along the  Pennsy shore we would have thought shooting the rapids a capital game.      RESTORING THE DROWNED.    [Illustration: Fig. 87. Pressing the Water out of the Stomach.]    [Illustration: Fig. 88. Expanding the Chest.]    [Illustration: Fig. 89. Squeezing out the Air from the Lungs.]    It was on the second day after Dutchy's exploit of the rapids that Bill  came so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#9)"],[1," of the room, I want mine. Don't you understand?\"    \"I am not interfering, dearest,\" called back Kathleen, \"and I am keeping  religiously to my own half. I have the straight window, and you have the  bay. I am not touching your beautiful half; I am only in mine.\"    \"Let me in,\" called Alice again, \"and don't be silly.\"    \"Sorry, dear; don't think I am silly.\"    There was a silence. Alice went on her knees and peered through the  keyhole: Kathleen was seated by her dressing-table, and there was a  sound of the furious scratching of a pen quite audible. \"This is  intolerable,\" thought Alice. \"She is the most awful girl I ever heard  of. I shall be late. Mary Addersley and Rhoda Pierpont are to call for  me shortly, and I shan't be ready. I don't want to appeal to mother or  to be rude to the poor wild thing the first day. Stay, I will tempt  her.--Kathleen!\"    \"Yes, darling.\"    \"Wouldn't you like to come with me to Cassandra Weldon's? She is so  nice, and so is her mother. She plays beautifully, and they will sing.\"    \"Irish songs?\" called out Kathleen.    \"I don't know. Perhaps they will if you ask them.\"    \"Thanks,\" replied Kathleen; \"I am not going.\" Again there was silence,  and the scratching of the pen continued. Alice was now obliged to go  downstairs to acquaint her mother.    \"What is it, dear? Why, my dear Alice, how excited you look!\"    \"I have cause to be, mother. I have come in rather late, very much  fagged out from a day of hard examination work and that imp--that horrid  girl--has locked me out of my bedroom. I was so looking forward to a  nice little supper with Cassandra and the other girls! Kathleen won't  let me in; she really is intolerable. I can't stay in the room with her  any longer; she is past bearing. Can't you give me an attic to myself at  the top of the house?\"    \"You know I haven't a corner.\"    \"Can't I share your bed, mummy? I shall be so miserable with that  dreadful Kathleen.\"    \"You know quite well, Alice, that that is the only really good bedroom  in the house, and I can't afford to give it to one girl by herself. I  think Kathleen will be all right when we really get to know her; but she  is very undisciplined. Still, three guineas a week makes an immense  difference to me, Alice. I can't help telling you so, my child.\"    \"In my opinion, it is hardly earned,\" said Alice. \"I suppose I must  stay down here and give up my supper. I can't go like this, all untidy,  and my hair so messy, and my collar--oh, mother, it is nearly black! It  is really too trying.\"    \"I will go up and see if I can persuade her,\" said Mrs. Tennant.    She went upstairs, turned the handle of the door, and spoke. The moment  her voice penetrated to Kathleen's ears, she jumped to her feet, crossed  the room, and bent down at the other side of the keyhole.    \"Don't tire your dear voice,\" she said. \"What is it you want?\"    \"I want you to open the door, Kathleen. Poor Alice wants to get in to  get her clothes. It is her room as much as yours. Let her in at once, my  dear.\"    \"I am very sorry, darling Mrs. Tennant, but I am privately engaged in my  own half of the room. I am not interfering with Alice's.\"    \"But you see, Kathleen, she can't get to her half.\"    \"The door is in my half, you know,\" said Kathleen very meekly, \"so I  don't see that she has any cause to complain. I am awfully sorry; I will  be as quick as I can.\"    \"You annoy me very much. You make me very uncomfortable by going on in  this extremely silly way, Kathleen.\"    \"I will darn some more socks for you, darling, tired pet,\" whispered  Kathleen coaxingly. \"I really am awfully sorry, but there is no help for  it. I must finish my own private affairs in my own half of the room.\"    She retreated from the door, and the scratching of the pen continued.    Alice downstairs felt like a caged lion. Mrs. Tennant admitted that  Kathleen's conduct was very bad.    \"It won't happen again, Alice,\" she said, \"for I shall remove the key  from the lock. She won't shut you out another time. Make the best of it,  darling. If we don't worry her too much she is sure to capitulate.\"    \"Not she. She is a perfect horror,\" said Alice.    Mrs. Weldon's supper party was to begin at eight o'clock. It was now  seven, and the girls were to call for Alice at half-past. If Kathleen  would only be quick she might still have time.    The boys came in. They stared open-eyed at Alice when they saw her still  sitting in her rough school things, a very cross expression on her face.  David came up to her at once; he was the favorite, and people said he  had a way with him. Whatever they meant by that, most people did what  David Tennant liked. He stood in front of his sister now and said:    \"What's the matter? And where's the little Irish beauty?\"    \"For goodness' sake don't speak about her,\" said Alice. \"She's driving  me nearly mad.\"    \"Your sister is naturally much annoyed, David,\" said his mother.  \"Kathleen is evidently a very tiresome girl. She has locked the door of  their mutual bedroom, and declines to open it; she says that as the door  happens to be in her half of the room, she has perfect control over it.\"    David whistled. Ben burst out laughing.    \"Well, now that is Irish,\" David said.    \"If you take her part I shall hate you all the rest of my life,\" said  Alice, speaking with great passion.    \"But can't you wait just for once?\" asked David. \"Any one could tell  she is just trying it on. She'll get tired of sitting there by herself  if only you have patience.\"    \"But I am due at Cassandra's for supper\" and Mary Addersley and Rhoda  Pierpont are to call for me at half-past seven.\"    \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said David.--\"Ben, leave off teasing.\" For Ben  was whistling and jumping about, and making the most expressive faces at  poor Alice,--\"I will see what I can do,\" he said, and he ran upstairs.  David was very musical; indeed, the soul of music dwelt in his eyes, in  his voice, in his very step. He might in some respects have been an  Irish boy himself. He bent down now and whistled very softly, and in the  most flute-like manner, \"Garry Owen\" through the keyhole. There was a  restless sound in the room, and then a cross voice said:    \"Go away.\"    David stopped whistling \"Garry Owen,\" and proceeded to execute a most  exquisite performance of \"St. Patrick's Day in the Morning.\" Kathleen  trembled. Her eyes filled with tears. David was now whistling right into  her room \"The Wearing of the Green.\" Kathleen flung down her pen, making  a splash on the paper.    \"Go away,\" she called out. \"What are you doing there?\"    \"The outside of this door doesn't belong to you,\" called David, \"and if  I like to whistle through the keyhole you can't prevent me;\" and he  began \"Garry Owen\" again.    Kathleen rushed to the door and flung it open. The tears were still wet  on her cheeks.    \"Can't you guess what you are doing?\" she said. \"You are stabbing  me--stabbing me. Oh! oh! oh!\" and she burst into violent sobs. David  took her hand.    \"Come, little Irish colleen,\" he said. \"Come along downstairs. I am  going to be chummy with you. Don't be so lonely. Give Alice her room;  one-half of it is hers, and she wants to dress to go out.\"    \"Let her take it all,\" sobbed Kathleen. \"I am most miserable. Oh, Garry  Owen, Garry Owen! Oh, Land of the Shamrock! Oh, my broken heart!\"    She laid her head on David's shoulder and went on sobbing. David felt  quite bashful. There was nothing for it but to take out his big and not  too clean handkerchief and wipe her tears away.    \"Whisper,\" he said in her ear. \"There are stables at the back of the  house; they are old, worn-out stables. There is a loft over one, and I  keep apples and nuts there. It's the jolliest place. Will you and I go  there for an hour or two after supper?\"    \"Do you mean it?\" said Kathleen, her eyes filling with laughter, and the  tears still wet on her cheeks.    \"Yes, colleen, I mean it, for I want you to tell me all you can about  your land of the shamrock.\"    \"Why, then, that I will,\" she replied. \"Wisha, then, David, it's a broth  of a boy, you are!\" and she kissed him on his forehead. David took her  hand and led her into the dining-room. Alice was still there, looking  more stormy than ever.    \"It's too late now,\" she said; \"the girls have come and gone. I can't go  at all now.\"    \"But why, darling?\" said Kathleen. \"Oh! I wish I had let you in.--She  must go, David, the poor dear. It would be cruel to disappoint  her.--What dress will you wear?\" said Kathleen.    \"Let me alone,\" said Alice.    She rushed upstairs, but Kathleen was even quicker.    \"I'm not going to be nasty to you any more,\" she said. \"I have found a  friend, and I shall have more friends to-morrow. Kathleen O'Hara would  have died long ago but for her friends. I shall be happy when I have got  a creelful of them here. Now then, let me help you. No, that isn't the  shoe you want; here it is. And gloves--here's a pair, and they're neatly  mended. Which hat did you say--the one with the blue scarf round it?  Isn't it a pretty one? You put that on. Aunt Katie O'Flynn is going to  send me a box of clothes from Dublin, and I will give you some of them.  You mustn't say no; I will give you some if you are nice. I am ever so  sorry that I kept you out of your part of the room; I won't do it any  more. Now you are dressed; that's fine. You won't hate me forever, will  you?\"    Alice growled something in reply. She had not Kathleen's passionate,  quick, impulsive nature--furious with rage one minute, sweet and gentle  and affectionate the next. She hated Kathleen for having humiliated and  annoyed her; and she went off to Cassandra's house knowing that she  would be late, and determined not to say one good word for Kathleen.          CHAPTER V.    WIT AND GENIUS: THE PLAN PROPOUNDED.      While Kathleen was locked in Alice's room, she was writing to her  father:         \"MY DARLING DADDY.--If ever there was a cold,"]]]
