When sense from spirit files away,  And subterfuge is done;    When that which is and that which was  Apart, intrinsic, stand,  And this brief tragedy of flesh  Is shifted like a sand;    When figures show their royal front  And mists are carved away, --  Behold the atom I preferred  To all the lists of clay!            II.    I have no life but this,  To lead it here;  Nor any death, but lest  Dispelled from there;    Nor tie to earths to come,  Nor action new,  Except through this extent,  The realm of you.            III.    Your riches taught me poverty.  Myself a millionnaire  In little wealths, -- as girls could boast, --  Till broad as Buenos Ayre,    You drifted your dominions  A different Peru;  And I esteemed all poverty,  For life's estate with you.    Of mines I little know, myself,  But just the names of gems, --  The colors of the commonest;  And scarce of diadems    So much that, did I meet the queen,  Her glory I should know:  But this must be a different wealth,  To miss it beggars so.    I 'm sure 't is India all day  To those who look on you  Without a stint, without a blame, --  Might I but be the Jew!    I 'm sure it is Golconda,  Beyond my power to deem, --  To have a smile for mine each day,  How better than a gem!    At least, it solaces to know  That there exists a gold,  Although I prove it just in time  Its distance to behold!    It 's far, far treasure to surmise,  And estimate the pearl  That slipped my simple fingers through  While just a girl at school!            IV.    THE CONTRACT.    I gave myself to him,  And took himself for pay.  The solemn contract of a life  Was ratified this way.    The wealth might disappoint,  Myself a poorer prove  Than this great purchaser suspect,  The daily own of Love    Depreciate the vision;  But, till the merchant buy,  Still fable, in the isles of spice,  The subtle cargoes lie.    At least, 't is mutual risk, --  Some found it mutual gain;  Sweet debt of Life, -- each night to owe,  Insolvent, every noon.            V.    THE LETTER.    \"GOING to him! Happy letter! Tell him --  Tell him the page I didn't write;  Tell him I only said the syntax,  And left the verb and the pronoun out.  Tell him just how the fingers hurried,  Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;  And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,  So you could see what moved them so.    \"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,  You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;  You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,  As if it held but the might of a child;  You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.  Tell him -- No, you may quibble there,  For it would split his heart to know it,  And then you and I were silenter.    \"Tell him night finished before we finished,  And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'  And you got sleepy and begged to be ended --  What could it hinder so, to say?  Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,  But if he ask where you are hid  Until to-morrow, -- happy letter!  Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!\"            VI.    The way I read a letter 's this:  'T is first I lock the door,  And push it with my fingers next,  For transport it be sure.    And then I go the furthest off  To counteract a knock;  Then draw my little letter forth  And softly pick its lock.    Then, glancing narrow at the wall,  And narrow at the floor,  For firm conviction of a mouse  Not exorcised before,    Peruse how infinite I am  To -- no one that you know!  And sigh for lack of heaven, -- but not  The heaven the creeds bestow.            VII.    Wild nights! Wild nights!  Were I with thee,  Wild nights should be  Our luxury!    Futile the winds  To a heart in port, --  Done with the compass,  Done with the chart.    Rowing in Eden!  Ah! the sea!  Might I but moor  To-night in thee!            VIII.    AT HOME.    The night was wide, and furnished scant  With but a single star,  That often as a cloud it met  Blew out itself for fear.    The wind pursued the little bush,  And drove away the leaves  November left; then clambered up  And fretted in the eaves.    No squirrel went abroad;  A dog's belated feet  Like intermittent plush were heard  Adown the empty street.    To feel if blinds be fast,  And closer to the fire  Her little rocking-chair to draw,  And shiver for the poor,    The housewife's gentle task.  \"How pleasanter,\" said she  Unto the sofa opposite,  \"The sleet than May -- no thee!\"            IX.    POSSESSION.    Did the harebell loose her girdle  To the lover bee,  Would the bee the harebell hallow  Much as formerly?    Did the paradise, persuaded,  Yield her moat of pearl,  Would the Eden be an Eden,  Or the earl an earl?            X.    A charm invests a face  Imperfectly beheld, --  The lady dare not lift her veil  For fear it be dispelled.    But peers beyond her mesh,  And wishes, and denies, --  Lest interview annul a want  That image satisfies.            XI.    THE LOVERS.    The rose did caper on her cheek,  Her bodice rose and fell,  Her pretty speech, like drunken men,  Did stagger pitiful.    Her fingers fumbled at her work, --  Her needle would not go;  What ailed so smart a little maid  It puzzled me to know,    Till opposite I spied a cheek  That bore another rose;  Just opposite, another speech  That like the drunkard goes;    A vest that, like the bodice, danced  To the immortal tune, --  Till those two troubled little clocks  Ticked softly into one.            XII.    In lands I never saw, they say,  Immortal Alps look down,  Whose bonnets touch the firmament,  Whose sandals touch the town, --    Meek at whose everlasting feet  A myriad daisies play.  Which, sir, are you, and which am I,  Upon an August day?            XIII.    The moon is distant from the sea,  And yet with amber hands  She leads him, docile as a boy,  Along appointed sands.    He never misses a degree;  Obedient to her eye,  He comes just so far toward the town,  Just so far goes away.    Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,  And mine the distant sea, --  Obedient to the least command  Thine eyes impose on me.            XIV.    He put the belt around my life, --  I heard the buckle snap,  And turned away, imperial,  My lifetime folding up  Deliberate, as a duke would do  A kingdom's title-deed, --  Henceforth a dedicated sort,  A member of the cloud.    Yet not too far to come at call,  And do the little toils  That make the circuit of the rest,  And deal occasional smiles  To lives that stoop to notice mine  And kindly ask it in, --  Whose invitation, knew you not  For whom I must decline?            XV.    THE LOST JEWEL.    I held a jewel in my fingers  And went to sleep.  The day was warm, and winds were prosy;  I said: \"'T will keep.\"    I woke and chid my honest fingers, --  The gem was gone;  And now an amethyst remembrance  Is all I own.            XVI.    What if I say I shall not wait?  What if I burst the fleshly gate  And pass, escaped, to thee?  What if I file this mortal off,  See where it hurt me, -- that 's enough, --  And wade in liberty?    They cannot take us any more, --  Dungeons may call, and guns implore;  Unmeaning now, to me,  As laughter was an hour ago,  Or laces, or a travelling show,  Or who died yesterday!                    III. NATURE.      I.    MOTHER NATURE.    Nature, the gentlest mother,  Impatient of no child,  The feeblest or the waywardest, --  Her admonition mild    In forest and the hill  By traveller is heard,  Restraining rampant squirrel  Or too impetuous bird.    How fair her conversation,  A summer afternoon, --  Her household, her assembly;  And when the sun goes down    Her voice among the aisles  Incites the timid prayer  Of the minutest cricket,  The most unworthy flower.    When all the children sleep  She turns as long away  As will suffice to light her lamps;  Then, bending from the sky    With infinite affection  And infiniter care,  Her golden finger on her lip,  Wills silence everywhere.            II.    OUT OF THE MORNING.    Will there really be a morning?  Is there such a thing as day?  Could I see it from the mountains  If I were as tall as they?    Has it feet like water-lilies?  Has it feathers like a bird?  Is it brought from famous countries  Of which I have never heard?    Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!  Oh, some wise man from the skies!  Please to tell a little pilgrim  Where the place called morning lies!            III.    At half-past three a single bird  Unto a silent sky  Propounded but a single term  Of cautious melody.    At half-past four, experiment  Had subjugated test,  And lo! her silver principle  Supplanted all the rest.    At half-past seven, element  Nor implement was seen,  And place was where the presence was,  Circumference between.            IV.    DAY'S PARLOR.    The day came slow, till five o'clock,  Then sprang before the hills  Like hindered rubies, or the light  A sudden musket spills.    The purple could not keep the east,  The sunrise shook from fold,  Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,  The lady just unrolled.    The happy winds their timbrels took;  The birds, in docile rows,  Arranged themselves around their prince  (The wind is prince of those).    The orchard sparkled like a Jew, --  How mighty 't was, to stay  A guest in this stupendous place,  The parlor of the day!            V.    THE SUN'S WOOING.    The sun just touched the morning;  The morning, happy thing,  Supposed that he had come to dwell,  And life would be all spring.    She felt herself supremer, --  A raised, ethereal thing;  Henceforth for her what holiday!  Meanwhile, her wheeling king    Trailed slow along the orchards  His haughty, spangled hems,  Leaving a new necessity, --  The want of diadems!    The morning fluttered, staggered,  Felt feebly for her crown, --  Her unanointed forehead  Henceforth her only one.              VI.    THE ROBIN.    The robin is the one  That interrupts the morn  With hurried, few, express reports  When March is scarcely on.    The robin is the one  That"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#9)"],[1,"in all parts, that they foresaw the petty  princes would not dare to negotiate an affair of such a nature,  being surrounded with the Imperial forces, who by their two generals,  Wallenstein and Tilly, kept them in continual subjection and terror.    This dilemma had like to have stifled the thoughts of the union as  a thing impracticable, when one Seigensius, a Lutheran minister, a  person of great abilities, and one whom the Elector of Saxony made  great use of in matters of policy as well as religion, contrived for  them this excellent expedient.    I had the honour to be acquainted with this gentleman while I was at  Leipsic. It pleased him exceedingly to have been the contriver of so  fine a structure as the Conclusions of Leipsic, and he was glad to be  entertained on that subject. I had the relation from his own mouth,  when, but very modestly, he told me he thought 'twas an inspiration  darted on a sudden into his thoughts, when the Duke of Saxony calling  him into his closet one morning, with a face full of concern, shaking  his head, and looking very earnestly, \"What will become of us,  doctor?\" said the duke; \"we shall all be undone at Frankfort-au-Main.\"  \"Why so, please your highness?\" says the doctor. \"Why, they will fight  with the King of Sweden with our armies and our money,\" says the duke,  \"and devour our friends and ourselves by the help of our friends and  ourselves.\" \"But what is become of the confederacy, then,\" said the  doctor, \"which your highness had so happily framed in your thoughts,  and which the Landgrave of Hesse was so pleased with?\" \"Become of it?\"  says the duke, \"'tis a good thought enough, but 'tis impossible to  bring it to pass among so many members of the Protestant princes as  are to be consulted with, for we neither have time to treat, nor will  half of them dare to negotiate the matter, the Imperialists being  quartered in their very bowels.\" \"But may not some expedient be found  out,\" says the doctor, \"to bring them all together to treat of it in  a general meeting?\" \"'Tis well proposed,\" says the duke, \"but in what  town or city shall they assemble where the very deputies shall not  be besieged by Tilly or Wallenstein in fourteen days' time, and  sacrificed to the cruelty and fury of the Emperor Ferdinand?\" \"Will  your highness be the easier in it,\" replies the doctor, \"if a way may  be found out to call such an assembly upon other causes, at which the  emperor may have no umbrage, and perhaps give his assent? You know the  Diet at Frankfort is at hand; 'tis necessary the Protestants should  have an assembly of their own to prepare matters for the General Diet,  and it may be no difficult matter to obtain it.\" The duke, surprised  with joy at the motion, embraced the doctor with an extraordinary  transport. \"Thou hast done it, doctor,\" said he, and immediately  caused him to draw a form of a letter to the emperor, which he did  with the utmost dexterity of style, in which he was a great master,  representing to his Imperial Majesty that, in order to put an end to  the troubles of Germany, his Majesty would be pleased to permit the  Protestant princes of the empire to hold a Diet to themselves, to  consider of such matters as they were to treat of at the General  Diet, in order to conform themselves to the will and pleasure of his  Imperial Majesty, to drive out foreigners, and settle a lasting peace  in the empire. He also insinuated something of their resolutions  unanimously to give their suffrages in favour of the King of Hungary  at the election of a king of the Romans, a thing which he knew the  emperor had in his thought, and would push at with all his might at  the Diet. This letter was sent, and the bait so neatly concealed, that  the Electors of Bavaria and Mentz, the King of Hungary, and several  of the Popish princes, not foreseeing that the ruin of them all lay in  the bottom of it, foolishly advised the emperor to consent to it.    In consenting to this the emperor signed his own destruction, for here  began the conjunction of the German Protestants with the Swede, which  was the fatalest blow to Ferdinand, and which he could never recover.    Accordingly the Diet was held at Leipsic, February 8, 1630, where the  Protestants agreed on several heads for their mutual defence,  which were the grounds of the following war. These were the famous  Conclusions of Leipsic, which so alarmed the emperor and the whole  empire, that to crush it in the beginning, the emperor commanded Count  Tilly immediately to fall upon the Landgrave of Hesse and the Duke of  Saxony as the principal heads of the union; but it was too late.    The Conclusions were digested into ten heads:--    1. That since their sins had brought God's judgments upon the whole  Protestant Church, they should command public prayers to be made to  Almighty God for the diverting the calamities that attended them.    2. That a treaty of peace might be set on foot, in order to come to a  right understanding with the Catholic princes.    3. That a time for such a treaty being obtained, they should appoint  an assembly of delegates to meet preparatory to the treaty.    4. That all their complaints should be humbly represented to his  Imperial Majesty and the Catholic Electors, in order to a peaceable  accommodation.    5. That they claim the protection of the emperor, according to the  laws of the empire, and the present emperor's solemn oath and promise.    6. That they would appoint deputies who should meet at certain  times to consult of their common interest, and who should be always  empowered to conclude of what should be thought needful for their  safety.    7. That they will raise a competent force to maintain and defend their  liberties, rights, and religion.    8. That it is agreeable to the Constitution of the empire, concluded  in the Diet at Augsburg, to do so.    9. That the arming for their necessary defence shall by no means  hinder their obedience to his Imperial Majesty, but that they will  still continue their loyalty to him.    10. They agree to proportion their forces, which in all amounted to  70,000 men.    The emperor, exceedingly startled at the Conclusions, issued out a  severe proclamation or ban against them, which imported much the  same thing as a declaration of war, and commanded Tilly to begin,  and immediately to fall on the Duke of Saxony with all the fury  imaginable, as I have already observed.    Here began the flame to break out; for upon the emperor's ban, the  Protestants send away to the King of Sweden for succour.    His Swedish Majesty had already conquered Mecklenburg, and part of  Pomerania, and was advancing with his victorious troops, increased  by the addition of some regiments raised in those parts, in order to  carry on the war against the emperor, having designed to follow up  the Oder into Silesia, and so to push the war home to the emperor's  hereditary countries of Austria and Bohemia, when the first messengers  came to him in this case; but this changed his measures, and brought  him to the frontiers of Brandenburg resolved to answer the desires  of the Protestants. But here the Duke of Brandenburg began to halt,  making some difficulties and demanding terms, which drove the king to  use some extremities with him, and stopped the Swedes for a while,  who had otherwise been on the banks of the Elbe as soon as Tilly,  the Imperial general, had entered Saxony, which if they had done, the  miserable destruction of Magdeburg had been prevented, as I observed  before. The king had been invited into the union, and when he first  came back from the banks of the Oder he had accepted it, and was  preparing to back it with all his power.    The Duke of Saxony had already a good army which he had with infinite  diligence recruited, and mustered them under the cannon of Leipsic.  The King of Sweden having, by his ambassador at Leipsic, entered into  the union of the Protestants, was advancing victoriously to their aid,  just as Count Tilly had entered the Duke of Saxony's dominions. The  fame of the Swedish conquests, and of the hero who commanded them,  shook my resolution of travelling into Turkey, being resolved to see  the conjunction of the Protestant armies, and before the fire was  broke out too far to take the advantage of seeing both sides.    While I remained at Vienna, uncertain which way I should proceed, I  remember I observed they talked of the King of Sweden as a prince of  no consideration, one that they might let go on and tire himself in  Mecklenburg and thereabout, till they could find leisure to deal with  him, and then might be crushed as they pleased; but 'tis never safe  to despise an enemy, so this was not an enemy to be despised, as they  afterwards found.    As to the Conclusions of Leipsic, indeed, at first they gave the  Imperial court some uneasiness, but when they found the Imperial  armies, began to fright the members out of the union, and that the  several branches had no considerable forces on foot, it was the  general discourse at Vienna, that the union at Leipsic only gave  the emperor an opportunity to crush absolutely the Dukes of Saxony,  Brandenburg, and the Landgrave of Hesse, and they looked upon it as a  thing certain.    I never saw any real concern in their faces at Vienna till news came  to court that the King of Sweden had entered into the union; but as  this made them very uneasy, they began to move the powerfulest methods  possible to divert this storm; and upon this news Tilly was hastened  to fall into Saxony before this union could proceed to a conjunction  of forces. This was certainly a very good resolution, and no measure  could have been more exactly concerted, had not the diligence of the  Saxons prevented it.    The gathering of this storm, which from a cloud began to spread over  the empire, and from the little duchy of Mecklenburg began to threaten  all Germany, absolutely determined me, as I noted"]]]
