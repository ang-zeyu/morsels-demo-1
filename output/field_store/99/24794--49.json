It is most striking to note how much this  meant to David. He accepts it as meaning that the nation's Messiah and the  world's King is to be of his own blood. \"Thou hast spoken also of thy  servant's house for a great while to come.\" Then follows this very  significant sentence: \"And this is (or, must be) the law of _the man_  (or, _the_ Adam).\" This promise must refer to the plan of God concerning  the woman's seed, _the_ man, _the Adam._    At the close, when the tether of life is slipping its hold, this vision of  the coming greater Heir promised by God evidently fills his eye. He says:        \"_There shall lie One_ that ruleth over men;      A righteous One, that ruleth in the fear of God.      And it shall be then as the light of the morning,      When the sun ariseth,      A morning without clouds,      The tender grass springing out of the earth through          clear shining after rain.\"        \"Verily, my own house has not been so with God;      Yet hath He made with me an everlasting covenant,      Ordered in all things and sure.      For this covenant is now all my comfort and all my desire,      Although he has not yet brought it to pass.\"    This seems to be the setting of those psalms of his referring to the  coming One. It was to be expected that his poetical fire would burn with  such a promise and conception. In the Second Psalm he sees this coming  Heir enthroned as God's own Son, and reigning supremely over the whole  earth despite the united opposition of enemies. In the One Hundred and  Tenth Psalm this Heir is sharing rule at God's right hand while waiting  the subduing of all enemies. He is to be divine, a king, and more, a  _priest_-king. Surrounded by a nation of volunteers full of youthful vigor  He will gain a decisive victory over the head of the allied enemies, and  yet be Himself undisturbed in the continual freshness of His vigor. And  all this rests upon the unchanging oath of Jehovah.    David's immediate heir found his father's pen, and in the Seventy-second  Psalm repeats, with his own variations, his father's vision of the coming  greater Heir. While there is repetition of the kingdom being world-wide  and unending, with all nations in subjection, the chief emphasis is put  upon the blessing to that great majority--the poor. They are to be freed  from all oppression, to have full justice done them, with plenty of food  to eat, and increased length of life.    That David's expectation had thoroughly permeated his circle is shown in  the joyous Forty-fifth Psalm, written by one of the court musicians. It  addresses the coming One as more than human, having great beauty and  graciousness, reigning in righteousness, victoriously, with a queen of  great beauty, and a princely posterity for unending generations.        <u>A Full-length Picture in Colors.</u>      These are but the beginnings. It is in the prophetic books, the third of  the groups, that the full picture with its brightest coloring is found.  The picture is not only winsome beyond all comparison and glorious, but  stupendous in its conception and its sweep. It is most notable that, as  the flood-tide of the nation's prosperity ebbs from its highest mark, the  vision to the prophetic eye of a coming glory grows steadily in  brightness and in distinctness. As the great kings go, the great prophets  come. It is to them we must turn for the full-length picture.    The one _continuous_ subject of the prophets is the coming King and  kingdom and attendant events. Immediate historical events furnish the  setting, but with a continual swinging to the coming future greatness. The  yellow glory light of the coming day is never out of the prophetic sky.  Its reflection is never out of the prophetic eye. Jeremiah is the one most  absorbed in the boiling of the political pot of his own strenuous time,  but even he at times lifts his head and gets such glimpses of the coming  glory as make him mix some rose tincture with the jet black ink he uses.    The common thread running through the fabric of the prophetic books clear  from Isaiah to Malachi is the phrase \"in that day.\" Sometimes it thickens  into \"the day of the Lord,\" \"the great day of the Lord,\" \"Jehovah hath a  great day,\" \"at that time.\" About this thread is woven in turn the whole  series of stirring scenes and events that are to mark the coming time.  Sometimes it is of local application; most times of the future time, and a  few times the meaning slides from one to the other, touching both.    Over all of these pages is the shadow of _Somebody_ coming down the aisle  of the ages, who is to be the world's Master. The figure of a man, large  to gigantic size, majestic, yet kindly as well as kingly, looms out  through these lines before the reader's face. The old idea of God Himself  dwelling in the midst of the people, sharing their life, made familiar by  Eden, by the flame-tipped mount and the glory-filled tent, comes out  again. For this coming One is said to be God Himself. But more than that  He is to be a man, and a _son_ of man; man bred of man. The blending of  the two, God and man, is pointed to in the unprecedented thing of a pure  virgin birth for this one. God and a pure maiden join themselves in His  coming. He is to be of native Hebrew stock, in direct descent from the  great David, and born in David's native village. Of course He is to be a  king as was David, but unlike that ancestor, to be not only a king, but a  priest, and a preacher and teacher.    The _kingdom_ he will set up will be like Himself in its blending of the  human and divine. Its origin is not human, but divine. The _capital_ is to  be Zion or Jerusalem. It will be marked by the glorious presence of God  Himself visibly present to all eyes. The _characteristics_ of the kingdom  are of peculiar attractiveness, at any time, to any people of this poor  old blood-stained, gun-ploughed battle-field of an earth. The stronger  traits that men commonly think of as desirable are combined with traits  that have been reckoned by men of all generations as absurdly,  unpractically idealistic.    There will be vengeance upon all enemies, who have been using Israel as a  common football, and great victory. Yet, strangely, these will be gotten  _without the use of violent force_, and will be followed by great peace.  The kingdom is to be established in loving-kindness and marked to an  unparalleled degree by a sense of right and justice to all. This feature  is emphasized over and over again, with refreshing frequency to those so  eager for such a revolutionary change in their affairs. Absolute gentle  fairness and impartiality will decide all difficulties arising. Even the  most friendless and the most obnoxious thing will be fairly judged.    That great universal majority, _the poor_, will be especially guarded and  cared for. There will be no hungry people, nor cold, nor poorly clad; no  unemployed, begging for a chance to earn a dry crust, and no workers  fighting for a fair share of the fruit of their sweat-wet toil. But there  are tenderer touches yet upon this canvas. Broken hearts will be healed  up, prison doors unhung, broken family circles complete again. It is to be  a time of great rejoicing by the common people. Yet all this will be  brought about, not immediately, but gradually, following the natural law  of growth; though the beginning will be marked by a great crisis, coming  suddenly.    The effect upon Israel _nationally_ is to be tremendous, sweepingly  reversing the conditions under which most of these predictions are made.  Israel is to become a Spirit-baptized nation, wholly swayed by the Spirit  of God, and that gracious sway never to be withdrawn. All judgments for  her sins are removed and all impurity thoroughly cleansed away. Possession  of their own land is assured. And the capital city is to become a _holy_  place from which, in common with the whole land, all impurity has been  cleansed away. All weakness and disability are gone, and full freedom from  the exactions of her former enemies to be enjoyed. Not only is Israel to  be at peace with all nations, but, far more, is to have the _leadership_  of the nations of the earth, and leadership of the highest sort--in a  world-wide spiritual movement, in the day when the Spirit of God is to be  poured out upon all flesh.    This leadership is to be a glorious and absolute supremacy among all the  nations of the earth. And yet this is not to be by man's method of  conquest, but of their own earnest accord all nations will come a-running  eagerly, voluntarily, with all their wealth and resources for the  upbuilding and service of Israel. In that time the Hebrew capital  Jerusalem will likewise be the capital of the earth.    No less radical and sweeping will be the changes in Israel _personally_,  individually. The people are to be _made over new within_. The modern word  for this sort of thing is regeneration. The old-fashioned word is a _new  heart--a new spirit_. The change is to be at the _core_; a change of the  sort. With this will come a marked spirit of devotion to God, and a  peculiar open-mindedness to the truth. There will be an absence of all  sickness and a decided increase in length of life and great increase in  numbers. There will be no longer any disappointment in plans, and the  _sense_ of _slavish fear_, which is universal, not only with all the  race, but through all time, will be utterly absent. Israel is to be a  nation of persons with thrilled hearts and radiant faces.        <u>Back to Eden.</u>      The effect upon _all the nations_ of the earth is a large part of the  background of the picture. Through Israel's advancement under the new  order, every other nation is to come back to God. The outpouring of the  Spirit upon Israel is to be followed by an outpouring upon _all_ flesh.

Now when Kaboniyan, [73] a great spirit, heard what Sayen had done,  he went to him and said:    \"Sayen you are a brave man because you have killed the Komow, Tomorrow  I will fight with you. You must remain on the low ground by the river,  and I will go to the hill above.\"    So the following day Sayen went to the low ground by the river. He  had not waited long before he heard a great sound like a storm, and  he knew that Kaboniyan was coming. He looked up, and there stood the  great warrior, poising his spear which was as large as a big tree.    \"Are you brave, Sayen?\" called he in a voice like thunder as he threw  the weapon.    \"Yes,\" answered Sayen, and he caught the spear.    This surprised Kaboniyan, and he threw his head-ax which was as large  as the roof of a house, and Sayen caught that also. Then Kaboniyan  saw that this was indeed a brave man, and he went down to Sayen and  they fought face to face until both were tired, but neither could  overcome the other.    When Kaboniyan saw that in Sayen he had found one as strong and brave  even as himself, he proposed that they go together to fight the people  of different towns. And they started out at once. Many people were  killed by this strong pair, and why they themselves could never be  captured was a great mystery. For it was not known that one was the  spirit Kaboniyan, and the other the son of an Alan.    If he was surrounded in a river, Sayen would become a fish [74]  and hide so that people could not find him. And if he was entrapped  in a town, he would become a chicken and go under the house in a  chicken-coop. In this way he escaped many times.    Finally one night after he had killed many in one town, the  people decided to watch him, and they saw him go to roost with the  chickens. The next day they placed a fish trap under the house near  the chicken-coop, and that night when Sayen went under the house he  was caught in the trap and killed.        The Sun and the Moon    _Tinguian_      Once the Sun and the Moon quarreled with each other, and the Sun said:    \"You are only the Moon and are not much good. If I did not give you  light, you would be no good at all.\"    But the Moon answered:    \"You are only the Sun, and you are very hot. The women like me better,  for when I shine at night, they go out doors and spin.\"    These words of the Moon made the Sun so angry that he threw sand in  her face, and you can still see the dark spots on the face of the Moon.        How the Tinguian Learned to Plant    _Tinguian_      In the very old times the Tinguian did not know how to plant and  harvest as they now do. For food they had only the things that grew  in the forests and fish from the streams. Neither did they know how  to cure people who became ill or were injured by evil spirits, and  many died who might otherwise have lived. [75]    Then Kadaklan, the Great Spirit who lives in the sky, saw that the  people often were hungry and sick, and he sent one of his servants,  Kaboniyan, to the earth to teach them many things. And it happened  this way:    Dayapan, a woman who lived in Caalang, had been sick for seven  years. One day when she went to the spring to bathe, there entered her  body a spirit who had rice and sugar-cane with him, and he said to her:    \"Dayapan, take these to your home and plant them in the ground, and  after a while they will grow large enough to reap. Then when they are  ripe, build a granary to put the rice in until you shall need it,  and a sugar-press to crush the cane. And when these are finished,  make the ceremony Sayung, and you will be well.\"    Dayapan was filled with wonder at these strange things, but she took  the rice and the sugar-cane and went home as she was commanded. While  she was trying to plant them in the ground the Spirit again entered  her body and showed her just what to do. Since then the Tinguian  have planted crops every year, and because they do as Kaboniyan [76]  taught the woman they have plenty to eat.    When Dayapan had reaped the first rice and cane, she began to make  the ceremony Sayung, and the Spirit came again and directed her. And  when it was finished and she was cured, he told her to take a dog  and a cock and go to bathe in the river as a sign that the ceremony  was finished. So she went to the river and tied the dog and the cock  near the water, but while she was bathing the dog ate the cock.    Dayapan wept bitterly at this and waited a long time for Kaboniyan,  and when at last he came, he said:    \"If the dog had not killed the cock, no person would die when you  make this ceremony; but this is a sign, and now some will die and  some will get well.\"    Dayapan called all the people together, and told them the things that  the spirit had taught her; and they could see that she had been made  well. After that, when people became ill they called Dayapan to treat  them. And it was as the Spirit had said; some died and others were  made well.        Magsawi    _Tinguian_      A great many years ago some Tinguian left their little village in the  valley early one morning and made their way toward the mountains. They  were off on a deer hunt, [77] and each carried his spear and head-ax,  while one held in leash a string of lean dogs eager for the chase.    Part way up the mountainside the dogs were freed, and the men  separated, going different ways in search of game. But ere long the  sharp barking of a dog called all in his direction, for they believed  that he had a deer at bay. As they approached the spot, however,  the object did not look like a deer, and as they drew nearer they  were surprised to find that it was a large jar. [78]    Filled with curiosity they pressed on, but the jar evaded them. Faster  and faster they ran, but the object, disappearing at times and then  coming into view again, always escaped them. On and on they went  until at last, tired out, they sat down on a wooded hill to rest and  to refresh themselves with betel-nut which they took from brass boxes  attached to their belts.    As they slowly cut the nuts and wrapped them in the lime and leaf  ready for chewing, they talked of nothing but the wonderful jar and  the mysterious power it possessed. Then just as they were about to  put the tempting morsels into their mouths they stopped, startled by  a strange soft voice which seemed to be near them. They turned and  listened, but could see no person.    \"Find a pig which has no young,\" said the voice, \"and take its blood,  for then you will be able to catch the jar which your dog pursued.\"    The men knew then that the mysterious jar belonged to a spirit, so  they hastened to do as the voice commanded, and when they had secured  the blood the dog again brought the jar to bay. The hunters tried to  seize it, but it entered a hole in the ground and disappeared. They  followed, and found themselves in a dark cave [79] where it was easy  to catch the jar, for there was no outlet save by the hole through  which they had entered.    Though that was many years ago, the jar still lives, and its name  is Magsawi. Even now it talks; but some years ago a crack appeared  in its side, and since then its language has not been understood by  the Tinguian. [80]    Sometimes Magsawi goes on long journeys alone when he visits his wife,  a jar in Ilocos Norte, or his child, a small jar in San Quintin;  but he always returns to Domayco on the hillside near the cave.        The Tree with the Agate Beads    _Tinguian_      More than a hundred seasons ago, a Tinguian went one day to the  mountains to hunt. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he made his way  steadily up the mountain side, only halting where it was necessary  to cut a path through the jungle. And the dog ran here and there  searching in the thick underbrush.    On and on he went without seeing any game, and then, when he was  almost at the top of the highest peak, the dog gave a sharp yelp,  and out of the brush leaped a fine deer. Zip! went the man's spear,  and it pierced the animal's side. For an instant he waited, but the  deer did not fall. On it ran with unslackened speed, and a moment  later it plunged into a hole in the ground with the man and dog in  close pursuit.    A short distance from the entrance the cave opened out into large,  spacious rooms, and before he realized it the man was hopelessly  lost In the distance he could hear the baying of the dog, and with  no other guide he hurried on through the darkness.    Following the sound, he went for a long time from one unfamiliar room  to another, stumbling in the darkness and striking against the stone  walls, and then suddenly his outstretched hands grasped a small tree  on which berries grew.    Astonished at finding anything growing in this dark place, he broke  off a branch, and as he did so the shrub began to talk in a strange  language. Terrified, the man ran in the direction he had last heard  the dog, and a moment later he found himself in the open air on the  banks of the Abra River, with the dead deer at his feet.    When he examined the twig which he still held in his hand, he saw  to his great surprise that the berries were agate beads of great  value. [81] And packing the deer on his back, he hastened home where  he told his wonderful story.    The sight of the beautiful beads convinced the people that he told  the truth, and a number of men at once returned with him to secure  the tree.    Their quest, however, was unsuccessful, for ere they reached the spot  the evil spirit had taken the tree away and on the walls of the cave  it had made strange carvings which even to this day can be seen.        The Striped Blanket    _Tinguian_      Three Tinguian once went to the mountains to hunt deer. They took  their blankets with them, for they expected to be gone several days,  and the nights in the mountains are cold.    The blankets of two of the men were of the blue-and-white designs  such as are"]]]
