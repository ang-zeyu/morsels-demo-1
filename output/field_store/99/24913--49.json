The dispatches simply stated that an unknown Negro was found  lynched in each case.    There are friends of humanity who feel their souls shrink from any  compromise with murder, but whose deep and abiding reverence for womanhood  causes them to hesitate in giving their support to this crusade against  Lynch Law, out of fear that they may encourage the miscreants whose deeds  are worse than murder. But to these friends it must appear certain that  these five men could not have been guilty of any terrible crime. They were  simply lynched by parties of men who had it in their power to kill them,  and who chose to avenge some fancied wrong by murder, rather than submit  their grievances to court.      LYNCHED BECAUSE THEY WERE SAUCY    At Moberly, Mo., February 18 and at Fort Madison, S.C., June 2, both in  1892, a record was made in the line of lynching which should certainly  appeal to every humanitarian who has any regard for the sacredness of  human life. John Hughes, of Moberly, and Isaac Lincoln, of Fort Madison,  and Will Lewis in Tullahoma, Tenn., suffered death for no more serious  charge than that they \"were saucy to white people.\" In the days of slavery  it was held to be a very serious matter for a colored person to fail to  yield the sidewalk at the demand of a white person, and it will not be  surprising to find some evidence of this intolerance existing in the days  of freedom. But the most that could be expected as a penalty for acting or  speaking saucily to a white person would be a slight physical chastisement  to make the Negro \"know his place\" or an arrest and fine. But Missouri,  Tennessee and South Carolina chose to make precedents in their cases and  as a result both men, after being charged with their offense and  apprehended, were taken by a mob and lynched. The civil authorities, who  in either case would have been very quick to satisfy the aggrieved white  people had they complained and brought the prisoners to court, by imposing  proper penalty upon them, did not feel it their duty to make any  investigation after the Negroes were killed. They were dead and out of the  way and as no one would be called upon to render an account for their  taking off, the matter was dismissed from the public mind.      LYNCHED FOR A QUARREL    One of the most notable instances of lynching for the year 1893, occurred  about the twentieth of September. It was notable for the fact that the  mayor of the city exerted every available power to protect the victim of  the lynching from the mob. In his splendid endeavor to uphold the law, the  mayor called out the troops, and the result was a deadly fight between the  militia and mob, nine of the mob being killed. The trouble occurred at  Roanoke, Va. It is frequently claimed that lynchings occur only in  sparsely settled districts, and, in fact, it is a favorite plea of  governors and reverend apologists to couple two arrant falsehoods, stating  that lynchings occur only because of assaults upon white women, and that  these assaults occur and the lynchings follow in thinly inhabited  districts where the power of the law is entirely inadequate to meet the  emergency. This Roanoke case is a double refutation, for it not only  disproves the alleged charge that the Negro assaulted a white woman, as  was telegraphed all over the country at the time, but it also shows  conclusively that even in one of the largest cities of the old state of  Virginia, one of the original thirteen colonies, which prides itself of  being the mother of presidents, it was possible for a lynching to occur in  broad daylight under circumstances of revolting savagery.    When the news first came from Roanoke of the contemplated lynching, it was  stated that a big burly Negro had assaulted a white woman, that he had  been apprehended and that the citizens were determined to summarily  dispose of his case. Mayor Trout was a man who believed in maintaining the  majesty of the law, and who at once gave notice that no lynching would be  permitted in Roanoke, and that the Negro, whose name was Smith, being in  the custody of the law, should be dealt with according to law; but the mob  did not pay any attention to the brave words of the mayor. It evidently  thought that it was only another case of swagger, such as frequently  characterizes lynching episodes. Mayor Trout, finding immense crowds  gathering about the city, and fearing an attempt to lynch Smith, called  out the militia and stationed them at the jail.    It was known that the woman refused to accuse Smith of assaulting her, and  that his offense consisted in quarreling with her about the change of  money in a transaction in which he bought something from her market booth.  Both parties lost their temper, and the result was a row from which Smith  had to make his escape. At once the old cry was sounded that the woman had  been assaulted, and in a few hours all the town was wild with people  thirsting for the assailant's blood. The further incidents of that day may  well be told by a dispatch from Roanoke under date of the twenty-first of  September and published in the _Chicago Record_. It says:      It is claimed by members of the military company that they frequently    warned the mob to keep away from the jail, under penalty of being shot.    Capt. Bird told them he was under orders to protect the prisoner whose    life the mob so eagerly sought, and come what may he would not allow him    to be taken by the mob. To this the crowd replied with hoots and    derisive jeers. The rioters appeared to become frenzied at the    determined stand taken by the men and Captain Bird, and finally a crowd    of excited men made a rush for the side door of the jail. The captain    directed his men to drive the would-be lynchers back.      At this moment the mob opened fire on the soldiers. This appeared for a    moment to startle the captain and his men. But it was only for a moment.    Then he coolly gave the command: \"Ready! aim! fire!\" The company obeyed    to the instant, and poured a volley of bullets into that part of the    mob which was trying to batter down the side door of the jail.      The rioters fell back before the fire of the militia, leaving one man    writhing in the agonies of death at the doorstep. There was a lull for a    moment. Then the word was quickly passed through the throng in front of    the jail and down the street that a man was killed. Then there was an    awful rush toward the little band of soldiers. Excited men were yelling    like demons.      The fight became general, and ere it was ended nine men were dead and    more than forty wounded.    This stubborn stand on behalf of law and order disconcerted the crowd and  it fell back in disorder. It did not long remain inactive but assembled  again for a second assault. Having only a small band of militia, and  knowing they would be absolutely at the mercy of the thousands who were  gathering to wreak vengeance upon them, the mayor ordered them to disperse  and go to their homes, and he himself, having been wounded, was quietly  conveyed out of the city.    The next day the mob grew in numbers and its rage increased in its  intensity. There was no longer any doubt that Smith, innocent as he was of  any crime, would be killed, for with the mayor out of the city and the  governor of the state using no effort to control the mob, it was only a  question of a few hours when the assault would be repeated and its victim  put to death. All this happened as per programme. The description of that  morning's carnival appeared in the paper above quoted and reads as  follows:      A squad of twenty men took the negro Smith from three policemen just    before five o'clock this morning and hanged him to a hickory limb on    Ninth Avenue, in the residence section of the city. They riddled his    body with bullets and put a placard on it saying: \"This is Mayor Trout's    friend.\" A coroner's jury of Bismel was summoned and viewed the body and    rendered a verdict of death at the hands of unknown men. Thousands of    persons visited the scene of the lynching between daylight and eight    o'clock when the body was cut down. After the jury had completed its    work the body was placed in the hands of officers, who were unable to    keep back the mob. Three hundred men tried to drag the body through the    streets of the town, but the Rev. Dr. Campbell of the First Presbyterian    church and Capt. R.B. Moorman, with pleas and by force prevented them.      Capt. Moorman hired a wagon and the body was put in it. It was then    conveyed to the bank of the Roanoke, about two miles from the scene of    the lynching. Here the body was dragged from the wagon by ropes for    about 200 yards and burned. Piles of dry brushwood were brought, and the    body was placed upon it, and more brushwood piled on the body, leaving    only the head bare. The whole pile was then saturated with coal oil and    a match was applied. The body was consumed within an hour. The cremation    was witnessed by several thousand people. At one time the mob threatened    to burn the Negro in Mayor Trout's yard.    Thus did the people of Roanoke, Va., add this measure of proof to maintain  our contention that it is only necessary to charge a Negro with a crime in  order to secure his certain death. It was well known in the city before he  was killed that he had not assaulted the woman with whom he had had the  trouble, but he dared to have an altercation with a white woman, and he  must pay the penalty. For an offense which would not in any civilized  community have brought upon him a punishment greater than a fine of a few  dollars, this unfortunate Negro was hung, shot and burned.      SUSPECTED, INNOCENT AND LYNCHED    Five persons, Benjamin Jackson, his wife,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14980"],[0,"Outwitting Our Nerves: A Primer of Psychotherapy (#9)"],[1,"ature's Plans Fall Through.= We have been describing the normal  course of affairs. We know that all too often the normal is not  achieved. Inner forces or outer circumstances too often conspire to  keep the young man or the young woman from the culmination toward  which everything has been moving. If the life-force cannot liberate  itself from the old family grooves to forge ahead into new channels,  or if economic demands or other conditions make postponement  necessary, then marriage is not possible. All the glandular secretions  and internal stimuli have been urging on to the final consummation,  developing physical and emotional life for an end that does not come;  or if it does come, is not sufficient to satisfy the demands of the  age-old instinct which for millions of years knew no restraint. In any  case, man finds himself, and woman herself, face to face with a  pressing problem, none the less pressing because it is in most cases  entirely unrecognized.    =Blundering Instincts.= The older a person is, the more fixed are his  habits. Now, an instinct is a race-habit and represents the  crystallized reactions of a past that is old. Whatever has been done  over and over again, millions of times, naturally becomes fixed,  automatic, tending to conserve itself in its old ways, to resist any  change and to act as it has always acted. This conserves energy and  works well so long as conditions remain the same. But if for any  reason there comes a change, things are likely to go wrong. By just so  far as things are different, an automatic habit becomes a handicap  instead of a help.    This having to act under changed conditions is exactly the trouble  with the reproductive instinct. Under civilization, conditions have  changed but the instinct has not. It is trying to act as it always  has acted, but civilized man wills otherwise. The change that has come  is not in the physical, external environment, but in man himself and  in the social environment which he has created. There is in man an  onward urge toward new and better things. Side by side with the desire  to live as he always has lived, there is a desire to make new  adaptations which are for the advancement of the whole race-life.  Besides the natural wish to take his desires as he finds them, there  is also the wish to modify them and use them for higher and more  socially useful ends.    As the race has found through long experience that monogamy is to be  preferred to promiscuous mating; that the highest interests of life  are fostered by loyalty to the institution of the family; that the  careful rearing of several children rather than the mere production of  many is in the long run to be desired; and that a single standard of  morality is practicable; so society has established for its members a  standard which is in direct opposition to the immeasurable urge of the  past. To make matters worse, there have at the same time grown up in  many communities a standard of living and an economic competition  which still further limit the size of the family and the satisfaction  of the reproductive impulse.    =The Perpetual Feud.= There thus arises the strategic struggle  between that which the race has found good in the past and that which  the race finds good in the present. As the older race-experience is  laid in they body and built into the very fiber of the individual,  inherited as an innate impulse, it has become an integral part of  himself, an individual need rather than a social one. On the other  hand, man has, as another innate part of his being, the desire to go  with the herd, to conform to the standards of his fellows, to be what  he has learned society wants him to be. Hence the struggle, insistent,  ever more pressing, between two sets of desires within the man  himself; the feud between the past and the present, between the  natural and the social, between the selfish and the ideal. On one  side, there is the demand for instinctive satisfaction; on the other,  for moral control; on one side the demand for pleasure; on the other,  the demands of reality.[13]    [Footnote 13: \"All the burdens of men or society are caused by the  inadequacies in the association of primal animal emotions with those  mental powers which have been so rapidly developed in  man-kind.\"--Shaler quoted by Hinkle: Introduction to Jung's  _Psychology of the Unconscious_.]    Two factors intensify the conflict. In the first place, the older  habits have the head start. Compared with the almost limitless extent  of our past history, our desire for the control of the instincts is  very new indeed. It requires the long look and the right perspective  to understand how very lately we have entered into our new conditions  and how old a habit we are trying to break. In the second place, the  larger part of the stimulus comes from within the body itself. When  studying the other instincts, we saw that the best way to control was  to refuse to stimulate when the situation was not suitable for  discharge. But with the organically aroused sex-instinct there is no  such power of choice. We may fan the flame by the thoughts we think or  the environment we seek, or we may smother the flame until it is out  of sight, but we cannot extinguish it by any act of ours. The issue  has always been too important to be left to the individual. The  stimulation comes, primarily, not by way of the mind but by way of the  body. With this instinct we cannot \"stop before we begin,\" because  Nature has taken the matter out of our hands and begins for us.      THE BULWARK WE HAVE BUILT    With the competing forces so strong and the issues so great, it is not  to be wondered at that society has had to build up a massive bulwark  of public opinion, to establish regulations and fix penalties that are  more stringent than those imposed in any other direction. Nor is it  remarkable that in its effort to protect itself, society has sometimes  made mistakes.    These blunders seem to lie in two directions. Assuming that it is  nearly impossible for the male to control his instincts, and that,  after all, it does not matter so much whether he does or not, society  has blinked at license in men, and thus has fostered a demoralizing,  anti-social double standard which has broken up countless homes, has  been responsible for the spread of venereal diseases, and has been  among the greatest curses of modern civilization. At the same time  society, in its efforts to maintain its standards for woman, has  taught its children, especially its girls, that anything savoring of  the word \"sexual\" is sinful, disgusting, and impure. To be sure, very  many women have modified their childish views, but an astonishingly  large number conserve, even in maturity, their warped ideas about the  whole subject of sex. Many a mature woman secretly believes that she,  at least, is not guilty of harboring anything so \"vulgar\" as a  reproductive instinct, not realizing that if this were so, she would  be, in very truth, a freak of nature.    Of course, woman is by nature as fully endowed with sex instincts as  is man. Kipling portrays the female of the species as \"deadlier than  the male\" in that the very framework of her constitution outlines the  one issue for which it was launched,--stanch against any attack which  might endanger the carrying on of life. Feeling the force of this  instinctive urge, she braces herself against precipitancy in response  by what seems almost a negation.    Just as we lean well in when riding around a corner, in order to keep  ourselves from falling out, so by an \"over-compensation\" for what is  unconsciously felt to be danger woman increases her feeling of safety  by setting up a taboo on the whole subject of sex. It is time that we  freed our minds from the artificial and perverted attitude toward this  dominant impulse; time to rescue the word \"sex\" from its implications  of grossness and sensuousness, and to recognize the instinct in its  true light as one of the necessary and holy forces of life, a force  capable of causing great damage, but also holding infinite  possibilities for good if wisely directed.    Society only gets its members into trouble when, even by implication,  it attempts to deny its natural make-up, and allows little children to  grow up with the false idea that one of their strongest impulses is to  be shunned by them as a thing of shame. We cannot dam back the flood  by building a bulwark of untruth, and then expect the bulwark to hold.    =Adaptable Energy.= We neither have to give in to our over-insistent  desires nor to deny that they exist. Man has a power of adaptation.  Just when we seem to run up against a dead wall, to face an  irreconcilable conflict, we find a wonderful power of indirect  expression that affords satisfaction to all the innate forces without  doing violence to the ethical standards which have proved so necessary  for the development of character.    Hunger, which, like the reproductive instinct, is stimulated by the  changing chemistry of the body, can be satisfied only by achieving its  primary purpose, the taking of material food; but the creative impulse  to reproduce oneself possesses a unique ability to spiritualize itself  and expend its energy in other lines of creative endeavor. There seems  to be some sort of close connection between the especially intense  energy of the reproductive instinct and the modes of expression of the  instinct for construction; a connection which makes possible the  utilization of threatening destructive energy by directing it toward  socially valuable work. Just as we harness the mountain stream and use  its wild force to light our cities, or catch the lightning to run our  trolley cars, so we find man and woman--under the right  conditions--easily and naturally switching over the power of their  surplus sex-energy to ends which seem at first only slightly related  to its original aim, but which resemble "]]]
