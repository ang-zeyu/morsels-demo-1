The President and Vice-President were to be chosen by  electors, who were to be appointed in each state \"in such manner as  the Legislature thereof may direct.\" These were at the time very  wise regulations, for they showed, as James Wilson, a member of the  Constitutional Convention, said, the most friendly disposition toward  the governments of the several States, and they tended to destroy the  seeds of jealousy which might otherwise spring up with regard to the  National Government. At that time the framers of the Constitution did  not deem it wise to limit in any respect the control of the States  over the subject of suffrage. There was then no uniformity regarding  the suffrage in the several states. A property qualification was  usually prescribed, but the amount of property it was necessary  to hold varied considerably in different states. For instance, in  Maryland all freemen, above 21 years of age, having a freehold of  fifty acres of land in the county in which they resided, and all  freemen having property in the state above the value of thirty pounds  current money and who had resided in the county one year, could vote.  In New Jersey \"all inhabitants\" of full age worth \"fifty pounds,  proclamation money clear estate within that government,\" could vote.  In New York \"every male inhabitant of full age\" who had resided within  the county for six months immediately preceding the day of election  could vote if he had been a freeholder possessing a freehold of the  value of twenty pounds within the county or had rented a tenement  therein of the yearly value of forty shillings, and had been rated and  actually paid taxes to the state. In a number of the States the right  to vote was restricted to taxpayers. In Pennsylvania every freeman  of 21 years who had resided in the state two years next before the  election and within that time had paid a State or a county tax could  vote.    There is today a wide divergence in the qualifications required in  the various states to entitle one to vote. In a few States there  are educational qualifications, as in California, Connecticut,  Massachusetts, Washington and North Carolina. In some States one  cannot vote unless he has paid certain taxes, almost always poll  taxes. In certain States Indians who are not members of any tribe can  vote. And in a number of the States every male of foreign birth,  21 years of age, who has declared his intention to become a citizen  according to the naturalization laws of the United States can vote.    These differences exist because the Constitution remains, so far as  this subject is concerned, as it was originally adopted, except that  the Fifteenth Amendment provides that \"The right of citizens of the  United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United  States or by any State on account of race, color or previous condition  of servitude.\" It is, however, an anomalous condition that the right  of citizens of the United States to vote remains wholly dependent on  the laws of the States, subject only to the restriction that in the  regulations the States establish they cannot discriminate against any  citizen on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.  If woman suffrage is a sound principle in a republican form of  government, and such I believe it to be, there is in my opinion  no reason why the States should not be permitted to vote upon an  Amendment to the Constitution declaring that no citizen shall be  deprived of the right to vote on account of sex.          CHAPTER VI    OBJECTIONS TO THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT      I. STATES RIGHTS. THIS OBJECTION IS URGED BY ALL OPPONENTS OF WOMAN  SUFFRAGE, BUT IS EITHER A BARRICADE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM THE  NECESSITY OF EXPOSING THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NO REASONS, OR IS A PLAY  TO POSTPONE WOMAN SUFFRAGE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. BY A FEW IT IS URGED  CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND WITH CONVICTION.    That there are many problems whose treatment belongs so appropriately  to state governments that any infringement of that right by the  Federal Government would be an act of tyranny, no American will  question. But assuredly woman suffrage is not one of these. One by  one classes of men have been granted the vote until women are the only  remaining unenfranchised class. States have set up various restrictive  qualifications so that criminality, idiocy, insanity, pauperism,  drunkenness, foreign birth are accepted as ordinary causes of  disfranchisement. Yet not one of these conditions is common to all the  states. The foreigner votes on his first papers in eight states and  a five years' residence will usually secure his naturalization and a  consequent vote in any state. The criminal, idiot and insane are not  denied a vote in several states, and in most a large class of ignorant  un-American men with no comprehension of our problems, our history, or  ideals, are conspicuous voters on election day. Millions of new voters  have entered our country and without the expenditure of time, money or  service have received the vote since the pending Federal Amendment was  first introduced.    For two generations groups of women have given their lives and their  fortunes to secure the vote for their sex and hundreds of thousands of  other women are now giving all the time at their command. No class of  men in our own or any other country has made one-tenth the effort nor  sacrificed one-tenth as much for the vote. The long delay, the  double dealing, the broken faith of political parties, the insult of  disfranchisement of the qualified in a land which freely gives the  vote to the unqualified, combines to produce as insufferable a tyranny  as any modern nation has perpetuated upon a class of its citizens.  The souls of women which should be warm with patriotic love of their  country are growing bitter over the inexplicable wrong their country  is doing them. Hands and heads that should be busy with other problems  of our nation are withheld that they may get the tools with which  to work. Purses that should be open to many causes are emptied into  suffrage coffers until this monumental injustice shall be wiped away.  Woman suffrage is a question of righting a nation-wide injustice, of  establishing a phase of unquestioned human liberty and of carrying out  a proposition to which our nation is pledged; it therefore transcends  all considerations of states rights. This objection comes chiefly  from Southern Democrats, who claim that it is a form of oppression for  three-fourths of the states to foist upon one-fourth measures of  which the minority of states do not approve. Yet the provision for  so amending the Constitution was adopted by the states and has stood  unchallenged in the Constitution for more than a century. If it be  unfair, undemocratic or even unsatisfactory, it is curious that no  movement to change the provision has ever developed. The Constitution  has been twice amended recently and it is interesting to note that it  happened under a Democratic Administration. More, the child labor and  eight-hour bills, while not constitutional amendments, are subject to  the same plea that no state shall have laws imposed upon it without  its consent. Both measures were introduced by Southern Democrats.  The pending Federal Prohibition Amendment was also introduced by a  Southern Democrat and is supported by many others. Upon consideration  of these facts, it would seem that \"states rights\" is either a theory  to be invoked whenever necessary to conceal an unreasoning hostility  to a measure or that those who advance it are guilty of extremely  muddy thinking.    The Constitution of the United States as now amended provides that no  male citizen subject to state qualifications shall be denied the  vote by any state. Were all the state constitutions amended so as to  enfranchise women, the word male would still stand in the National  Constitution. Men and women would still be unequal, since the National  Constitution can impose a penalty upon a state which denies the vote  to men, but none upon the state which discriminates against women.  A woman comes from Montana to represent that state in Congress.  The State of Montana has done its utmost to remove her political  disabilities, yet should she cross the border of her state and live  in North Dakota, she loses all that Montana gave her. Not so the male  voter. Enfranchised in one state, he is enfranchised in all (subject  to difference of qualification only). The women of this nation will  never be content with less protection in their right to vote than  is given to men and there is no other possible way to secure that  protection except through amendment to the National Constitution.  No single state, nor the forty-eight collectively, can grant that  protection except through the Federal Constitution.    As granting to half the population of our country the right of  consent to their own government, whose expenses they help to pay, is  a question of fundamental human liberty, Congress and the legislatures  should be proud to act and to add one more immortal chapter to  America's history of freedom.      II. SOUTHERN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS VERY GENERALLY URGE THAT THEY OPPOSE  THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT WILL CONFER THE VOTE UPON THE NEGRO  WOMEN OF THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES; AND THAT THAT WILL INTERFERE WITH  WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE SOUTH.    It is difficult to believe this objection to be sincere, since facts  do not support the contention. The facts are that woman suffrage  secured by Federal Amendment will be subject to whatever restrictions  may be imposed by state constitutions (provided those restrictions are  in accord with the National Constitution) in precisely the same way  as woman suffrage secured by state"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#9)"],[1,"on a  light ground (e. g. Naucratite and Rhodian ware), the space within  outlines being filled more or less with wash of colour, survived in  Athens side by side with the more usual black glazed ware, and in the  fifth century was particularly affected for the class of funerary  lekythi, vases made for offering at a tomb (III, Fig. 30). Outlines at  first drawn in black, then golden brown, lastly a dull red.    Miscellaneous.  Walls. Sixth century. Characteristic type of polygonal wall, each  irregular stone very carefully fitted to its neighbours.    Fortifications usually built with square towers and bastions  projecting from the curtain.    Round watch towers here and there to be met with.    Bricks. Baked bricks rarely used till Roman days. Bricks stamped by  King Nabis (early second century) have been found at Sparta.    Terra-cotta roof tiles (sometimes with stamped inscriptions)  largely used.    Laconian Pottery Characteristics. Fragments of black glazed Attic  ware are the class of remains easiest to pick up on any Greek  inhabited site, except perhaps in Laconia, where perhaps for  political reasons the local style was never ousted and pursued its  natural process of decay until Hellenistic times. Use of white slip  over pink clay complete at end of seventh century, then partial;  abandoned by beginning of fifth century. Characteristic patterns,  squares, and dots (III, Fig. 28) seventh century; lotus and pomegranates  sixth century and fifth century.    500 B.C.--After the end of the fifth century, manufacture of vases at  Athens decayed. Supply chiefly from South Italy. Growing use of  additional white (rare in Attic red figure vases), sometimes addition  of detail in yellowish brown, and a general coarseness of execution,  mark the change.    Terra-cotta figurines (figures of everyday life, mostly female; head-  quarters Tanagra in Boeotia) prevalent.      V. HELLENISTIC    300 B.C. Side by side with decay of red-figure style appear two  classes of vase that became very prevalent.  (1) White designs, often floral, on totally black ground of inferior  dull glaze.  (2) Black ware decorated not by paint but by moulded figures and  patterns.  Also the handles of unpainted jars with stamped impressions (buff  clay) not uncommon. Provenance mainly Rhodes.      VI. ROMAN    Hellenistic ware (2) is forerunner of Samian or Aretine red pottery  with moulded designs. Very widespread in Greece in Imperial days.      VII. BYZANTINE AGE    Remains as far as the scope of this section is concerned are few.  Fragments of pottery may be found at Sparta. These bear strong  resemblance to the contemporary wares found in Egypt belonging to the  early Mohammedan period.    Transparent lustrous glaze. Ground usually pale yellow or cream,  sometimes pale green. Designs childish in character. Lions, birds,  human figures painted in brown under the glaze or incised through.          CHAPTER III      ASIA MINOR    [See the diagrams of pottery, Illustration V: ASIA MINOR POTTERY]    1. Introductory.    Travellers are more likely to make new discoveries elsewhere than on  the actual sites of ancient towns and villages. In many cases the  site is found to be entirely bare of all remains except sometimes  small fragments of pottery. In general, inscribed and other stones  have been carried away to serve as building material for mosques,  houses, fountains, bridges, &c., or as headstones for graves in  cemeteries or for other utilitarian purposes. It is, therefore, in  and near modern villages and towns that inscriptions are chiefly to  be found, as well as smaller antiquities, such as clay tablets, pots  or fragments of them, terra-cotta figures, coins, and so forth. The  smaller articles may sometimes be found in the bazaars, but they are  usually in the hands of individuals.    It should not be assumed that inscriptions which are exposed to  public view have all been copied; moreover, new stones are constantly  being turned up, especially where building is going on and where  there are old sites or cemeteries close at hand. Great numbers of  inscribed stones are hidden away in private dwellings, where they are  difficult of discovery and of access. Travellers should take  advantage of opportunities that may offer of examining antiquities in  private houses, and of visiting sites or monuments about which  information may be received, particularly if they are a little off  the beaten track. Reward will often come in the shape of valuable  discoveries, of which many remain to be made. Cilicia in particular  has been imperfectly explored, and interesting monuments and  inscriptions, particularly Hittite, may be found there.      2. Pottery Fabrics.    It is not yet possible to describe fully or accurately the succession  of styles, or even to assign all known fabrics to their proper  periods. For this reason, even the most fragmentary specimens are of  interest, provided only that:     (1) the outer surface is fairly well preserved,     (2) the place of discovery is known.    All fragments showing a rim or spout, handles or part of a base,  should be preserved until they can be compared with a more perfect  specimen.    The following fabrics, however, are widely distributed, and usually  seem to have flourished in the order in which they are here  described:    A.  Hand-made wares, rough within, but smooth or burnished surface, self-  coloured (drab or brown), or intentionally coloured black (by charred  matter in the clay, or by a smoky fire), or red (by a clear fire,  sometimes aided by a wash or 'slip' of more ferruginous clay).  Sometimes a black ware is 'overfired' to an ashy grey.    In such wares ornament is rare, and consists mainly of (a) incised  dots, dashes, or lines, in simple rectilinear patterns (chevrons,  zigzags, lozenges), often enhanced by a white chalky filling (V, Figs 5-  8); (b) ridges or bosses modelled in the clay surface, or adhering to  it. The forms are plump and globular, often round-bottomed or  standing on short feet. Rims are absent or ill-developed; necks  actually prolonged into trough-spouts or long beaks; handles are very  simple and short. Vases are sometimes modelled like animals, or have  human faces or breasts (V, Figs. 1-4).    These wares begin in the Stone Age, and seem to predominate in the  early and middle Bronze Age. Locally they may have lasted even later,  but the use of the potter's wheel spread rapidly in the early Bronze  Age.    B.  Hand-made wares of light-coloured clay, with painted decoration,  usually in black or reddish-brown. The paint is generally without  glaze, but sometimes is decayed and easily washes off.    The forms and ornaments resemble those of class A, but are less rude  and more varied. Distinct rims and standing-bases appear, and spouts  give place to a pinched lip.    C.  Hand-made wares of black or other dark clay, with painted decoration  in white or ochre. These fabrics are rather rare, and the paint is  easily washed off. The forms follow those of class B.    Classes B and C seem to begin early in the Bronze Age, and are  gradually replaced by the corresponding wheel-made fabrics of class  D.    D.  Wheel-made pottery begins in the Bronze Age, and is distinguished by  its symmetrical forms, and by the texture of the inner surface,  especially about the rim and base, where the potter's fingers have  grazed the whirling clay. Self-coloured wares still occur, and are  sometimes elegant ('bucchero' ware); but the improved furnaces now  permit general use of light-coloured clays, suited to painted  decoration. Glazed paint is still rare, and may be taken as probable  token of date not earlier than the end of the Bronze Age. The glaze-  painted wares of the Greek island-world occasionally wandered to the  mainland a little earlier than this, but not far from the coast. On  wheel-made pottery the ornament is either (a) applied while the pot  is on the wheel, and consequently limited to lines and bands  following the plane of rotation, or (b) added afterwards, free-hand,  usually between such bands, and especially on the neck and shoulder.    Simple rectilinear schemes are commonest (panels, lozenges, and  triangles, enriched with lattice and chequers) (V, Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12);  with these in the Early Iron Age appear little targets of concentric  circles drawn mechanically with compasses (V, Figs. 13-15); also, by  degrees, birds (V, Fig. 16), animals, and simple plant designs  (rosettes, lotus, palmette), and occasionally human figures. But as a  rule, the mainland pottery is very simply decorated, and insular  imports are rare, except within the area within Greek colonization.    In the Later Iron Age or Historic Period, from the seventh century  onward, the pot-fabrics of Asia Minor rapidly assimilate two main  classes of foreign fashions, Greek and Oriental.    E.  The Oriental types (mainly from Syria) are all plump and heavy  looking, usually in coarse buff or cream-coloured ware, almost  without paint. The Greek forms are more graceful, varied, and  specialized; light-coloured clays predominate, with simple bands of  black ill-glazed paint, absorbed by the inferior clays.    After Alexander's time the Greek and the Oriental forms became  confused; the general level of style and execution falls, painted  decoration almost disappears, and the outer surface is often ribbed  by uneven pressure of the fingers on the whirling clay. This fashion  is a sign of late Hellenistic or Graeco-Roman date.    F.  Meanwhile, the black-glazed Greek (mainly Athenian) wares spread  widely for table use, and were imitated locally from the fourth  century onwards. The clay is pale or reddish (genuine Greek fabrics  are usually quite red within) and the glaze thick, black, and of a  brilliant glassy smoothness. Imitations are of all degrees of  inferiority.    G.  Other late fabrics have smooth ill-glazed surfaces, of various red,  brown, or chocolate tints, over hard-ba"]]]
