Now the Dharma-kaya is emphatically not a phenomenon  but it may be regarded as the substratum or totality of phenomena or  as that which gives phenomena whatever reality they possess and the  double use of the word dharma rendered such divagations of meaning  easier.[96] Hindus have a tendency to identify being and knowledge.  According to the Vedanta philosophy he who knows Brahman, knows that  he himself is Brahman and therefore he actually is Brahman. In the  same way the true body of the Buddha is prajna or knowledge.[97] By  this is meant a knowledge which transcends the distinction between  subject and object and which sees that neither animate beings nor  inanimate things have individuality or separate existence. Thus the  Dharma-kaya being an intelligence which sees the illusory quality of  the world and also how the illusion originates[98] may be regarded as  the origin and ground of all phenomena. As such it is also called  Tathagatagarbha and Dharma-dhatu, the matrix or store-house of all  phenomena. On the other hand, inasmuch as it is beyond them and  implies their unreality, it may also be regarded as the annihilation  of all phenomena, in other words as Nirvana. In fact the Dharma-kaya  (or Bhuta-tathata) is sometimes[99] defined in words similar to those  which the Pali Canon makes the Buddha use when asked if the Perfect  Saint exists after death--\"it is neither that which is existence nor  that which is non-existence, nor that which is at once existence and  non-existence nor that which is neither existence nor non-existence.\"  In more theological language it may be said that according to the  general opinion of the Mahayanists a Buddha attains to Nirvana by the  very act of becoming a Buddha and is therefore beyond everything which  we call existence. Yet the compassion which he feels for mankind and  the good Karma which he has accumulated cause a human image of him  (Nirmana-kaya) to appear among men for their instruction and a  superhuman image, perceptible yet not material, to appear in Paradise.

Such  an equipment can only be obtained from a previous Buddha and therefore  the series of Buddhas must extend infinitely backwards.]    [Footnote 90: For the prevalence of the doctrine in mediaeval Bengal  see B.K.

Sometimes the Adi-Buddha is identified with Vajrasattva or  Samantabhadra, although these beings are otherwise classified as  Bodhisattvas. This appears analogous to the procedure common in  Hinduism by which a devotee declares that his special deity is all the  gods and the supreme spirit.]    [Footnote 91: It would appear that some of the Tantras treat of five  bodies, adding to the three here given others such as the Anandakaya,  Vajrakaya and Svabhavakaya.

Metaphysics became a passion among  the travellers of the Great Vehicle as psychology had been in earlier  times. They may indeed be reproached with being bad Buddhists since  they insisted on speculating on those questions which Gotama had  declared to be unprofitable and incapable of an answer in human  language. He refused to pronounce on the whence, the whither and the  nature of things, but bade his disciples walk in the eightfold path  and analyse the human mind, because such analysis conduces to  spiritual progress. India was the last country in the world where such  restrictions were likely to be observed. Much Mahayanist literature is  not religious at all but simply metaphysics treated in an  authoritative and ecclesiastical manner. The nature and origin of the  world are discussed as freely as in the Vedanta and with similar  results: the old ethics and psychology receive scant attention. Yet  the difference is less than might be supposed. Anyone who reads these  treatises and notices the number of apparently eternal beings and the  talk about the universal mind is likely to think the old doctrine that  nothing has an atman or soul, has been forgotten. But this impression  is not correct; the doctrine of _Nairatmyam_ is asserted so  uncompromisingly that from one point of view it may be said that even  Buddhas do not exist. The meaning of this doctrine is that no being or  object contains an unchangeable permanent self, which lives unaltered  in the same or in different bodies. On the contrary individual  existences consist of nothing but a collection of skandhas or a  _santana_, a succession or series of mental phenomena. In the Pali  books this doctrine is applied chiefly to the soul and psychological  enquiries. The Mahayana applied it to the external world and proved by  ingenious arguments that nothing at all exists. Similarly the doctrine  of Karma is maintained, though it is seriously modified by the  admission that merit can be transferred from one personality to  another. The Mahayana continued to teach that an act once performed  affects a particular series of mental states until its effect is  exhausted, or in popular language that an individual enjoys or suffers  through a series of births the consequences of previous acts.

And so the young son of their  chieftain was made to sleep in the skins of the beaver and  coyote, that he might grow wise in building, and keen of scent in  following game. On some days he was fed with _la-pe'-si_ that  he might become a good swimmer, and on other days the eggs of the  great _to-tau'-kon_ (crane) were his food, that he might grow  tall and keen of sight, and have a clear, ringing voice. He was  also fed on the flesh of the _he'-ker_ that he might be fleet  of foot, and on that of the great _yo-sem'-i-te_ (grizzly bear)  to make him powerful in combat.    And the little boy grew up and became a great and wise chieftain,  and he was also a rain wizard, and brought timely rains for the  crops.    As was the custom in giving names to all Indians, his name was  changed from time to time, as his character developed, until he  was called Choo'-too-se-ka', meaning the Supreme Good. His  grand _o-chum_ (house) was built at the base of the great rock  called To-tau-kon-nu'-la [El Capitan], because the great  _to-tau'-kons_ made their nests and raised their young in a  meadow at its summit, and their loud ringing cries resounded over  the whole Valley.    As the moons and snows passed, this great rock and all the great  rocky walls around the Valley grew in height, and the hills  became high mountains.    After a time Choo'-too-se-ka' built himself a great palace  _o'-chum_ on the summit of the rock To-tau-kon-nu'-la, and  had his great chair of state a little west of his palace, where  on all festival occasions he could overlook and talk to the great  multitude below; and the remains of this chair are still to be  seen.    Choo'-too-se-ka' was then named To-tau-kon-nu'-la, because  he had built his _o'-chum_ on the summit of the great rock and  taken the place of the _to-tau'-kons_. He had no wife, but all  the women served him in his domestic needs, as he was their great  chief, and his wishes were paramount. The many valuable donations  which he received from his people at the great annual festivals  made him wealthy beyond all personal wants, and he gave freely to  the needy.    One day, while standing on the top of the great dome [Sentinel  Dome] above the south wall of the Valley, watching the great  herds of deer, he saw some strange people approaching, bearing  heavy burdens. They were fairer of skin, and their clothing was  different from that of his people, and when they drew near he  asked them who they were and whence they came.    And a woman replied, \"I am Tis-sa'-ack, and these are some of  my people. We come from _cat'-tan chu'-much_ (far South). I  have heard of your great wisdom and goodness, and have come to  see you and your people. We bring you presents of many fine  baskets, and beads of many colors, as tokens of our friendship.  When we have rested and seen your people and beautiful valley we  will return to our home.\"    [Illustration: _Photograph by Foley_  HALF DOME (TIS-SA'-ACK). 5,000 Feet.  Named for a woman in Indian mythology who was turned to stone for  quarreling with her husband. See \"Legend of Tis-sa'-ack.\"]    To-tau-kon-nu'-la was much pleased with his fair visitor, and  built a large _o'-chum_ for her and her companions on the  summit of the great dome at the east end of the Valley [Half  Dome], and this dome still retains her name.    And she tarried there and taught the women of Ah-wah'-nee how  to make the beautiful baskets which they still make at the  present day; and To-tau-kon-nu'-la visited her daily, and  became charmed with her loveliness, and wanted her to remain and  be his wife, but she denied him, saying, \"I must return to my  people,\" and, when he still persisted, she left her _o'-chum_  in the night and was never seen again. And the love-stricken  chieftain forgot his people, and went in search of her, and they  waited many moons for his return and mourned his long absence,  but they never saw him more.    This was the beginning of a series of calamities which nearly  destroyed the great tribe of Ah-wah-nee'-chees. First a great  drouth prevailed, and the crops failed, and the streams of water  dried up. The deer went wild and wandered away. Then a dark cloud  of smoke arose in the East and obscured the sun, so that it gave  no heat, and many of the people perished from cold and hunger.  Then the earth shook terribly and groaned with great pain, and  enormous rocks fell from the walls around Ah-wah'-nee. The  great dome called Tis-sa'-ack was burst asunder, and half of it  fell into the Valley. A fire burst out of the earth in the East,  and the _ca'-lah_ (snow) on the sky mountains was changed to  water, which flowed down and formed the Lake Ah-wei'-yah  [Mirror Lake]. And all the streams were filled to overflowing,  and still the waters rose, and there was a great flood, so that a  large part of the Valley became a lake, and many persons were  drowned.    After a time the Great Spirit took pity on his children, and the  dark cloud of smoke disappeared, the sun warmed the Valley again  into new life, and the few people who were left had plenty of  food once more.    Many moons afterwards there appeared on the face of the great  rock To-tau-kon-nu'-la the figure of a man in a flowing robe,  and with one hand extended toward the West, in which direction he  appears to be traveling. This figure was interpreted to be the  picture of the great lost Chieftain, indicating that he had gone  to the \"happy hunting grounds\" of his ancestors, and it is looked  upon with great veneration and awe by the few Indians still  living in Yosemite. At about the same time the face of the  beautiful Tis-sa'-ack appeared on the great flat side of the  dome which bears her name, and the Indians recognized her by the  way in which her dark hair was cut straight across her forehead  and fell down at the sides, which was then considered among the  Yosemites as the acme of feminine beauty, and is so regarded to  this day.      ANOTHER LEGEND OF TIS-SA'-ACK.    Tis-sa'-ack and her husband traveled from a far-off country,  and entered the Valley footsore and weary. She walked ahead,  carrying a great conical burden-basket, which was supported by a  band across her forehead, and was filled with many things. He  followed after, carrying a rude staff in his hand and a roll of  woven skin blankets over his shoulder. They had come across the  mountains and were very thirsty, and they hurried to reach the  Valley, where they knew there was water. The woman was still far  in advance when she reached the Lake Ah-wei'-yah [Mirror Lake],  and she dipped up the water in her basket and drank long and  deep. She was so thirsty that she even drank up all the water in  the lake and drained it dry before her husband arrived. And  because the lake was dry there came a terrible drouth in the  Valley, and the soil was dried up and nothing grew.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_  A BURDEN BEARER.  The women are the principal burden bearers and all loads are  carried in large baskets, supported by a band across the  forehead.]    And the husband was much displeased because the woman had drunk  up all the water and left none for him, and he became so angry  that he forgot the customs of his people and beat the woman with  his staff. She ran away from him, but he followed her and beat  her yet more. And she wept, and in her anger she turned and  reviled her husband, and threw her basket at him. And while they  were in this attitude, one facing the other, they were turned  into stone for their wickedness, and there they still retain. The  upturned basket lies beside the husband, where the woman threw  it, and the woman's face is tear stained with long dark lines  trailing down.    Half-Dome is the woman Tis-sa'-ack and North Dome is her  husband, while beside the latter is a smaller dome which is still  called Basket Dome to this day.      LEGEND OF THE GRIZZLY BEAR.    The significance and derivation of the name \"Yosemite,\" as given  by old Tenei'-ya, chief of the tribe, have been explained in  another chapter, but there is also a legendary account of its  origin, which may be of interest.    Long, long ago, when the remote ancestors of the Yosemite Indians  dwelt peacefully in the valley called Ah-wah'-nee [Yosemite  Valley], one of the stalwart young braves of the tribe went early  one morning to spear some fish in the lake Ah-wei'-yah [Mirror  Lake]. Before reaching his destination he was confronted by a  huge grizzly bear, who appeared from behind one of the enormous  boulders in that vicinity, and savagely disputed his passage.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Foley._  EL CAPITAN (TO-TAU-KON-NU'-LA), 3,300 Feet.  Indians believe that this great rock grew from a small boulder.  See \"Legend of the Tul-tok'-a-na.\"]    Being attacked in this unexpected manner, the Indian defended  himself to the best of his ability, using for the purpose the  dead limb of a tree which was near at hand, and, after a long and  furious struggle, in which he was badly wounded, he at length  succeeded in killing the bear.    His exploit was considered so remarkable by the rest of the tribe  that they called him Yo-sem'-i-te (meaning a full-grown grizzly  bear), in honor of his achievement, and this name was transmitted  to his children, and eventually to the whole tribe.      LEGEND OF THE TUL-TOK'-A-NA.    There were once two little boys living in the Valley of  Ah-wah'-nee, who went down to the river to swim. When they had  finished their bath they went on shore and lay down on a large  boulder to dry themselves in the sun. While lying there they fell  asleep, and slept so soundly that they never woke up again.  Through many moons and many snows they slept, and while they  slept the great rock [El Capitan] on which they lay was slowly  rising, little by"]]]
