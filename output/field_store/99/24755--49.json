France at length succumbed beneath this last  chastisement; God gave her a glimpse of a prince whom she did not  deserve.  Earth was not worthy of him; he was already ripe for a blessed  eternity!\"    \"For some time past I have feared that a fatality hung over the dauphin,\"  Fenelon had written at the first news of his illness; \"I have at the  bottom of my heart a lurking apprehension that God is not yet appeased  towards France.  For a long while He has been striking, as the prophet  says, and His anger is not yet worn out.  God has taken from us all our  hope for the Church and for the State.\"    Fenelon and his friends had expected too much and hoped for too much;  they relied upon the dauphin to accomplish a work above human strength;  he might have checked the evil, retarded for a while the march of events,  but France carried simultaneously in her womb germs of decay and hopes of  progress, both as yet concealed and confused, but too potent and too  intimately connected with the very sources of her history and her  existence for the hand of the most virtuous and most capable of princes  to have the power of plucking them out or keeping them down.    There was universal and sincere mourning in France and in Europe.  The  death of the little Duke of Brittany, which took place a few days after  that of his parents, completed the consternation into which the court was  thrown.  The most sinister rumors circulated darkly; a base intrigue  caused the Duke of Orleans to be accused; people called to mind his taste  for chemistry and even magic, his flagrant impiety, his scandalous  debauchery; beside himself with grief and anger, he demanded of the king  to be sent to the Bastille; the king refused curtly, coldly, not unmoved  in his secret heart by the perfidious insinuations which made their way  even to him, but too just and too sensible to entertain a hateful lie,  which, nevertheless, lay heavy on the Duke of Orleans to the end of his  days.    [Illustration: Louis XIV. in Old Age----47]    Darkly, but to more effect, the same rumors were renewed before long.  The Duke of Berry died at the age of twenty-seven on the 4th of May,  1714, of a disease which presented the same features as the scarlet fever  (_rougeole vourpree_) to which his brother and sister-in-law had  succumbed.  The king was old and sad; the state of his kingdom preyed  upon his mind; he was surrounded by influences hostile to his nephew,  whom he himself called \"a vaunter of crimes.\"  A child who was not five  years old remained sole heir to the throne.  Madame de Maintenon, as sad  as the king, \"naturally mistrustful, addicted to jealousies,  susceptibilities, suspicions, aversions, spites, and woman's wiles \"  [_Lettres de Fenelon au duc de Chevreuse_], being, moreover, sincerely  attached to the king's natural children, was constantly active on their  behalf.  On the 19th of July, 1714, the king announced to the premier  president and the attorney-general of the Parliament of Paris that it was  his pleasure to grant to the Duke of Maine and to the Count of Toulouse,  for themselves and their descendants, the rank of princes of the blood,  in its full extent, and that he desired that the deeds should be  enregistered in the Parliament.  Soon after, still under the same  influence, he made a will which was kept a profound secret, and which  he sent to be deposited in the strong-room (_greffe_) of the Parliament,  committing the guardianship of the future king to the Duke of Maine, and  placing him, as well his brother, on the council of regency, with close  restrictions as to the Duke of Orleans, who would he naturally called to  the government of the kingdom during the minority.  The will was darkly  talked about; the effect of the elevation of bastards to the rank of  princes of the blood had been terrible.  \"There was no longer any son of  France; the Spanish branch had renounced; the Duke of Orleans had been  carefully placed in such a position as not to dare say a word or show the  least dissatisfaction; his only son was a child; neither the Duke (of  Berry), his brothers, nor the Prince of Conti, were of an age or of  standing, in the king's eyes, to make the least trouble in the world  about it.  The bombshell dropped all at once when nobody could have  expected it, and everybody fell on his stomach as is done when a shell  drops; everybody was gloomy and almost wild; the king himself appeared as  if exhausted by so great an effort of will and power.  He had only just  signed his will, when he met, at Madame de Maintenon's, the Ex-Queen of  England.  \"I have made my will, Madame,\" said he.  \"I have purchased  repose; I know the impotence and uselessness of it; we can do all we  please as long as we are here; after we are gone, we can do less than  private persons; we have only to look at what became of my father's, and  immediately after his death too, and of those of so many other kings.  I am quite aware of that; but, in spite of all that, it was desired; and  so, Madame, you see it has been done; come of it what may, at any rate I  shall not be worried about it any more.\"  It was the old man yielding to  the entreaties and intrigues of his domestic circle; the judgment of the  king remained steady and true, without illusions and without prejudices.    Death was coming, however, after a reign which had been so long and had  occupied so much room in the world that it caused mistakes as to the very  age of the king.  He was seventy-seven; he continued to work with his  ministers; the order so long and so firmly established was, not disturbed  by illness any more than it had been by the reverses and sorrows of late;  meanwhile the appetite was diminishing, the thinness went on increasing,  a sore on the leg appeared, the king suffered a great deal.  On the 24th  of August he dined in bed, surrounded as usual by his courtiers; he had a  difficulty in swallowing; for the first time, publicity was burdensome to  him; he could not get on, and said to those who were there that he begged  them to withdraw.  Meanwhile the drums and hautboys still went on playing  beneath his window, and the twenty-four violins at his dinner.  In the  evening, he was so ill that he asked for the sacraments.  There had been  wrung from him a codicil which made the will still worse.  He,  nevertheless, received the Duke of Orleans, to whom he commended the  young king.  On the 26th he called to his bedside all those of the court  who had the entry.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said to them, \"I ask your pardon for  the bad example I have set you.  I have to thank you much for the way in  which you have served me, and for the attachment and fidelity you have  always shown me.  I am very sorry not to have done for you what I should  have liked to do.  The bad times are the cause of that.  I request of  you, on my great-grandson's behalf, the same attention and fidelity that  you have shown me.  It is a child who will possibly have many crosses to  bear.  Follow the instructions my nephew gives you; he is about to govern  the kingdom, and I hope that he will do it well; I hope also that you  will all contribute to preserve unity.  I feel that I am becoming  unmanned, and that I am unmanning you also; I ask your pardon.  Farewell,  gentlemen; I feel sure that you will think of me sometimes.\"    The princesses had entered the king's closet; they were weeping and  making a noise.  \"You must not cry so,\" said the king, who asked for them  to bid them farewell.  He sent for the little dauphin.  His governess,  the Duchess of Ventadour, brought him on to the bed.  \"My child,\" said  the king to him, \"you are going to be a great king.  Render to God that  which you owe to Him; recognize the obligations you have towards Him;  cause Him to be honored by your subjects.  Try to preserve peace with  your neighbors.  I have been too fond of war; do not imitate me in that,  any more than in the too great expenses I have incurred.  Take counsel in  all matters, and seek to discern which is the best in order to follow it.  Try to relieve your people, which I have been so unfortunate as not to  have been able to do.\"  He kissed the child, and said, \"Darling, I give  you my blessing with all my heart.\"  He was taken away; the king asked  for him once more and kissed him again, lifting hands and eyes to Heaven  in blessings upon him.  Everybody wept.  The king caught sight in a glass  of two grooms of the chamber who were sobbing.  \"What are you crying  for?\" he said to them; \"did you think that I was immortal?\"  He was left  alone with Madame de Maintenon.  \"I have always heard say that it was  difficult to make up one's mind to die,\" said he; \"I do not find it so  hard.\"  \"Ah, Sir,\" she replied, \"it may be very much so, when there are  earthly attachments, hatred in the heart, or restitutions to make!\"  \"Ah!\" replied the king, \"as for restitutions to make, I owe nobody any  individually; as for those that I owe the kingdom, I have hope in the  mercy of God.\"    [Illustration: The Death-bed of Louis XIV.----50]    The Duke of Orleans came back again; the king had sent for him.  \"When I  am dead,\" he said, \"you will have the young king taken to Vincennes; the  air there is good; he will remain there until all the ceremonies are over  at Versailles, and the castle well cleaned afterwards; you will then  bring him back again.\"  He at the same time gave orders for going and  furnishing Vincennes, and directed a casket to be opened in which the  plan of the castle was kept, because, as the court had not been there for  fifty years, Cavoye, grand chamberlain of his household, had never  prepared apartments there.  \"When I was king .  .  .  ,\" he said several  times.    A quack had brought a remedy which would cure gangrene, he said.  The  sore on the leg was hopeless, but they gave the king a dose of the elixir  in a glass of Alicante.  \"To life and to death,\" said he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV. (#9)"],[1,"   Shall bar the door, and keep the key.        To painted roofs, and shining spires    (Uneasy feats of high desires)    Let the unthinking many croud,    That dare be covetous, and proud;    In golden bondage let them wait,    And barter happiness for state:    But oh! my Chloe when thy swain    Desires to see a court again;    May Heav'n around his destin'd head    The choicest of his curses shed,    To sum up all the rage of fate.    In the two things I dread, and hate,    May'st thou be false, and I be great.    In July 1721, within two months of his death, Mr. Prior published the  following beautiful little tale on the falshood of mankind, entitled  The Conversation, and applied it to the truth, honour, and justice of  his grace the duke of Dorset.      The CONVERSATION. A Tale.        It always has been thought discreet    To know the company you meet;    And sure, there may be secret danger    In talking much before a stranger.    Agreed: what then? then drink your ale;    I'll pledge you, and repeat my tale.        No matter where the scene is fix'd,    The persons were but odly mix'd,    When sober Damon thus began:    (And Damon is a clever man)        I now grow old; but still from youth,    Have held for modesty and truth,    The men, who by these sea-marks steer,    In life's great voyage, never err;    Upon this point I dare defy    The world; I pause for a reply.        Sir, either is a good assistant,    Said one, who sat a little distant:    Truth decks our speeches, and our books,    And modesty adorns our looks:    But farther progress we must take;    Not only born to look and speak,    The man must act. The Stagyrite    Says thus, and says extremely right;    Strict justice is the sovereign guide,    That o'er our actions should preside;    This queen of virtue is confess'd    To regulate and bind the rest.    Thrice happy, if you can but find    Her equal balance poise your mind:    All diff'rent graces soon will enter,    Like lines concurrent to their center.        'Twas thus, in short, these two went on,    With yea and nay, and pro and con,    Thro' many points divinely dark,    And Waterland assaulting Clarke;    'Till, in theology half lost,    Damon took up the Evening-Post;    Confounded Spain, compos'd the North,    And deep in politics held forth.        Methinks, we're in the like condition,    As at the treaty of partition;    That stroke, for all King William's care,    Begat another tedious war.    Matthew, who knew the whole intrigue,    Ne'er much approv'd that mystic league;    In the vile Utrecht treaty too,    Poor man! he found enough to do.    Sometimes to me he did apply;    But downright Dunstable was I,    And told him where they were mistaken,    And counsell'd him to save his bacon:    But (pass his politics and prose)    I never herded with his foes;    Nay, in his verses, as a friend,    I still found something to commend.    Sir, I excus'd his Nut-brown maid;    Whate'er severer critics said:    Too far, I own, the girl was try'd:    The women all were on my side.    For Alma I return'd him thanks,    I lik'd her with her little pranks;    Indeed, poor Solomon, in rhime,    Was much too grave to be sublime.    Pindar and Damon scorn transition,    So on he ran a new division;    'Till, out of breath, he turn'd to spit:    (Chance often helps us more than wit)    T'other that lucky moment took,    Just nick'd the time, broke in, and spoke.        Of all the gifts the gods afford    (If we may take old Tully's word)    The greatest is a friend, whose love    Knows how to praise, and when reprove;    From such a treasure never part,    But hang the jewel on your heart:    And pray, sir (it delights me) tell;    You know this author mighty well--    Know him! d'ye question it? ods fish!    Sir, does a beggar know his dish?    I lov'd him, as I told you, I    Advis'd him--here a stander-by    Twitch'd Damon gently by the cloke,    And thus unwilling silence broke:    Damon, 'tis time we should retire,    The man you talk with is Matt. Prior.        Patron, thro' life, and from thy birth my friend,    Dorset, to thee this fable let me send:    With Damon's lightness weigh thy solid worth;    The foil is known to set the diamond forth:    Let the feign'd tale this real moral give,    How many Damons, how few Dorsets live!    Mr. Prior, after the fatigue of a length of years past in various  services of action, was desirous of spending the remainder of his days  in rural tranquility, which the greatest men of all ages have been  fond of enjoying: he was so happy as to succeed in his wish, living a  very retired, and contemplative life, at Downhall in Essex, and found,  as he expressed himself, a more solid, and innocent satisfaction among  woods, and meadows, than he had enjoyed in the hurry, and tumults  of the world, the courts of Princes, or the conducting foreign  negotiations; and where as he melodiously sings,      The remnant of his days he safely past,    Nor found they lagg'd too slow, nor flew too fast;    He made his wish with his estate comply,    Joyful to live, yet not afraid to die.    This great man died on the 18th of September, 1721, at Wimple in  Cambridgshire, the seat of the earl of Oxford, with whose friendship  he had been honoured for some years. The death of so distinguished a  person was justly esteemed an irreparable loss to the polite world,  and his memory will be ever dear to those, who have any relish for the  muses in their softer charms. Some of the latter part of his life was  employed in collecting materials for an History of the Transactions of  his own Times, but his death unfortunately deprived the world of what  the touches of so masterly a hand, would have made exceeding valuable.    Mr. Prior, by the suffrage of all men of taste, holds the first rank  in poetry, for the delicacy of his numbers, the wittiness of his  turns, the acuteness of his remarks, and, in one performance, for the  amazing force of his sentiments. The stile of our author is likewise  so pure, that our language knows no higher authority, and there is an  air of original in his minutest performances.    It would be superfluous to give any detail of his poems, they are in  the hands of all who love poetry, and have been as often admired, as  read. The performance however, for which he is most distinguished, is  his Solomon; a Poem in three Books, the first on Knowledge, the second  on Pleasure, and the third on Power. We know few poems to which this  is second, and it justly established his reputation as one of the best  writers of his age.    This sublime work begins thus,      Ye sons of men, with just regard attend,    Observe the preacher, and believe the friend,    Whose serious muse inspires him to explain,    That all we act, and all we think is vain:    That in this pilgrimage of seventy years,    O'er rocks of perils, and thro' vales of tears    Destin'd to march, our doubtful steps we tend,    Tir'd of the toil, yet fearful of its end:    That from the womb, we take our fatal shares,    Of follies, fashions, labours, tumults, cares;    And at approach of death shall only know,    The truths which from these pensive numbers flow,    That we pursue false joy, and suffer real woe.    After an enquiry into, and an excellent description of the various  operations, and effects of nature, the system of the heavens, &c. and  not being fully informed of them, the first Book concludes,      How narrow limits were to wisdom given?    Earth she surveys; she thence would measure Heav'n:    Thro' mists obscure, now wings her tedious way;    Now wanders dazl'd, with too bright a day;    And from the summit of a pathless coast    Sees infinite, and in that sight is lost.    In the second Book the uncertainty, disappointment, and vexation  attending pleasure in general, are admirably described; and in the  character of Solomon is sufficiently shewn, that nothing debases  majesty, or indeed any man, more than ungovernable passion.      When thus the gath'ring storms of wretched love    In my swoln bosom, with long war had strove;    At length they broke their bounds; at length their force    Bore down whatever met its stronger course:    Laid all the civil bounds of manhood waste.    And scatter'd ruin, as the torrent past.    The third Book treats particularly of the trouble and instability  of greatness and power, considers man through the several stages and  conditions of life, and has excellent reasoning upon life and death.  On the last are these lines;      Cure of the miser's wish, and cowards fear,    Death only shews us, what we knew was near.    With courage therefore view the 'pointed hour;    Dread not death's anger, but expect its power;    Nor nature's laws, with fruitless sorrow mourn;    But die, O mortal man! for thou wast born.    The poet has likewise these similies on life;      As smoke that rises from the kindling fires    Is seen this moment, and the next expires:    As empty clouds by rising winds are tost,    Their fleeting forms no sooner found than lost:    So vanishes our state; so pass our days;    So life but opens now, and now decays;    The cradle, and the tomb, alas! so nigh;    To live is scarce distinguished from to die.    We shall conclude this account of Mr. Prior's life with the following  copy of verses, written on his Death by Robert Ingram, esq; which is a  very successful imitation of Mr. Prior's manner.      1.      Mat. Prior!--(and we must submit)      Is at his journey's end;    In whom the world has lost a wit,      And I, what's more, a friend.      2.      Who vainly hopes long here to stay,      May see with weeping eyes;    Not only nature posts away,      But e'en good nature dies!    3.      Should grave ones count these praises light,      To such it may be said:    A man, in this lamented wight,      Of business too is dead.      4.      From ancestors, as might a fool!      He trac'd no high-fetch'd stem;    "]]]
