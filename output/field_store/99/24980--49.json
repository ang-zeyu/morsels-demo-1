They carry large bows and  wear quivers holding arrows._)    We are safe here, my men. Tell King Alfred that.    [_The first Soldier salutes and enters forest._]    SECOND SOLDIER. Danes may hide in the hut, Prince--    PRINCE (_shaking head_). There's only an old woman within.    [_Enter_ FIRST SOLDIER. _He holds the bushes and vines aside._]    FIRST SOLDIER. The king!    [_Enter_ KING ALFRED. _He is disguised as a beggar. He is young, manly,  and courageous._]    PRINCE (_bowing)._ You can rest safely here, King Alfred.    KING. Do you think the Danes are still in pursuit?    PRINCE. No, your Majesty, I am sure we have escaped them this time.    SECOND SOLDIER. Besides, they would not know your Majesty dressed so.    KING (_anxiously_). Gentlemen, disguise yourselves as you have me.    PRINCE. That will not do, Sire. The Danes must not see you dressed as we  are. 'Twill make you safer.    KING. Aye, but there's more danger for you dressed so. Come, be beggars  now with me!    FIRST SOLDIER (_shaking head_). Our first thought is for you, Sire.    SECOND SOLDIER. Should you fall into the Danes' hands now, what will  become of England?    KING. Why, she must fight again!    PRINCE, (_shaking head_). Our soldiers ran from the Danes to-day, and  lost the battle to them!    KING. 'Tis because they fear these Danes as they do monsters,--monsters  come to rob them,--to burn their homes,--to make them slaves!    SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!    KING. If only I could turn their fear to rage and fierce, hot anger!  Then England would not flee! She'd fight her foes and conquer!    SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!    PRINCE. 'Tis for that great work you should save yourself, Sire! For  that, you should wear the beggar's rags now!    [_Enter_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS _in great haste._]    THIRD SOLDIER. Sire, save yourself! The Danes still follow us!    FOURTH SOLDIER. They have crossed the river!    THIRD SOLDIER. They pursue your Majesty!    PRINCE. Go to the hut there, Sire. Let the Danes find you begging from  the goodwife.    KING. But you, my men, where will you hide?    FIRST SOLDIER. We'll scatter, Sire.    KING. Then go, go at once! I'll await you here, if the Danes go on.    PRINCE (_saluting_). Farewell, my King!    SOLDIERS (_saluting_). Farewell, King Alfred, farewell!    [_They go. The King crosses to hut, and knocks at door, which is opened  by the_ GOODWIFE. _She holds a wooden bowl and a large flat stone in her  hands._]    GOODWIFE (_aside_). Another beggar, as I live!    (_Aloud, sharply_). Well, what do you want?    KING. A bite to eat, goodwife.    GOODWIFE. My cakes are not yet baked.    KING. I will wait, then.    GOODWIFE (_indignantly_). Well, and you will not, sir!    KING (_alarmed_). You will not drive me off, good woman!    GOODWIFE. And who are you, that you should sit by and wait, whilst I do  all the work! And do you think you are the king, sir?    KING. No, no! I--    GOOD WIFE (_interrupting_). You'll fry the cakes yourself, sir! And that  you will at once, sir! Go now and mend the fire, and lay this stone upon  it.    [_The King takes the stone; crosses to the fire, and stirs it; places  the stone on the burning wood. When the stone is hot, the Goodwife pours  the batter from the bowl on the stone._]    GOODWIFE. Now watch these cakes while I'm within. And watch them well:  rye cakes do burn while one is winking.    KING. I'll watch them carefully, goodwife.    (_The Goodwife enters hut. The King turns the cakes carefully, then sits  on a log; he shows that his thoughts are far away._)    I _will_ drive them out! I _will!_    (_Pause._)    To-night I'll get my men together.    (_Pause._)    We will take them by surprise--at daybreak.    [_Enter the_ GOODWIFE; _she rushes to the fire._]    GOOD WIFE (_looking at cakes_). Burnt to cinders! Not one of them fit  to eat!    KING. I am sorry--I--    GOOD WIFE (_interrupting)._ Oh, you good-for-nothing! I would like to  beat you!    KING. What can I do to make it right?    GOODWIFE (_taking up a stick_). You'll mix more dough! More dough! Do  you hear?    KING. I'll be glad to do it, Madam!    GOODWIFE (_flourishing stick_). In with you! Now in with you, and get to  work!    [_The King enters the hut. Enter_ DANISH CHIEF _and_ DANES _from the  forest. They carry spears and shields._]    GOODWIFE (_with fear; dropping stick_). The Danes!    CHIEF (_haughtily)._ Aye, Danes!    GOODWIFE. I have no silver! Not a piece, sir!    CHIEF. Burn the hut, men!    DANES. Aye! Aye!    [_They start toward the hut. The Goodwife falls on her knees before  them._]    GOODWIFE. I pray you, spare my home!    [Illustration: \"NOT ONE OF THEM FIT TO EAT!\"]    CHIEF. We spare no home to any English. Do you not know that?    GOODWIFE. I've heard so--    FIRST DANE. We'll burn every home on English land before we go!    SECOND DANE. And drive every Englishman into the seas!    DANES. Aye! Aye!    GOODWIFE (_sobbing)._ I pray you--    CHIEF (_roughly)._ Come, get up! Get up and cease your weeping! I like  it not. Get up, I say!    [_Goodwife rises, trembling with fear._]    CHIEF. Now listen; we will not burn your hut, if you will tell us what  we wish to know.    GOODWIFE. I will tell you what I can--    CHIEF. Did King Alfred pass this way in flight?    GOODWIFE (_starting_). What? Our king in flight?    CHIEF (_angrily_). Come, no tears for him! Did he pass this way, I say?    GOODWIFE. No, my lord.    FIRST DANE. Do not believe her, chief! There's not an Englishman that  would not hide him from us!    GOODWIFE (_forgetting her fear_). Aye, and die for him!    CHIEF (_angrily)._ Say not such words to me! I am your king that is to  be!    DANES. Aye! Aye!    CHIEF. Go search within the hut, Danes!    [_Danes enter hut. They come out immediately bringing King Alfred._]    FIRST DANE. We found this man within, chief.    SECOND DANE. 'Tis only her husband, I think.    GOODWIFE (_indignantly_). _Husband_, say you?--that beggar!    CHIEF (_showing suspicion_). Ah, a beggar--!    GOODWIFE. Yes, my lord, he came but just before you.    FIRST DANE (_whispering_). Hear that, my lord,--just before us!    SECOND DANE (_whispering_). It may be King Alfred!    THIRD DANE (_whispering_). Disguised as a beggar, sir!    FOURTH DANE (_whispering_). 'Twould be safest to take him prisoner, my  lord!    CHIEF (_nodding_). We'll take him with us to be certain.    GOODWIFE (_hearing this_). Yes, take him! 'Twould serve him right! He  burnt my cakes just now!    CHIEF. What! Burnt your cakes?    GOODWIFE. Yes, my lord! And I'd have beaten him had not your lordship  come.    CHIEF (_aside to Danes_). This cannot be the king.    FIRST DANE (_shaking head_). No king would fry cakes!    SECOND DANE (_shaking head_). He could not be made to fry them!    THIRD DANE (_shaking head_). Nor take a beating from a woman!    [_The Goodwife has crept up to listen; and so overhears this last  remark._]    GOODWIFE. He wouldn't, eh? Ha, ha! Well, I sent him within to mix fresh  dough! And I sent him with my stick, I did!    [_Flourishing stick._]    FOURTH DANE. Would you let a woman threaten you with a stick, my lord?    CHIEF (_proudly)._ Never! Besides, King Alfred would be dressed as are  his princes and his soldiers. I have thought that from the first.  Release the beggar!    [_Danes release King Alfred._]    CHIEF. Now listen, Danes! A hundred silver pieces will I give the man  who makes King Alfred prisoner! Hear--all of you!--One hundred silver  pieces!    DANES. Aye! Aye!    CHIEF (_to Goodwife and Alfred_). And when this Alfred's taken, to me  you'll bend your English knees! To me, you English beggar! Now come, my  men! To hunt King Alfred!    DANES (_going_). To hunt King Alfred! To hunt King Alfred!    [_They go. King Alfred smiles. The Goodwife looks after them, listening  for a moment._]    GOODWIFE. May they never see a hair of his head!    (_Lifting up arms._)    May Heaven protect and save King Alfred!    KING (_growling_). You seem to love King Alfred--    GOODWIFE. I love the ground he treads on!    KING (_as before_). Of course,--'tis English ground!    GOODWIFE (_shaking head_). Not that--I love the air he breathes!    KING. Well--'tis English air.    GOODWIFE (_sharply)._ No, no! I love the king!--the king himself!    KING (_growling)._ Out upon King Alfred! Out upon him, I say!    GOODWIFE (_angrily)._ You are a traitor, sir!    KING. What has he done for England? He has lost every battle to the  Danes! He is running from them now!    GOODWIFE. 'Tis no fault of his! If the king's men were as brave as he,  there would not be a Dane on English land to-day!    KING (_still growling_). Well, I'm glad there's one that thinks so well  of him!    GOODWIFE. You are a traitor and should be punished!    (_Taking up stick._)    I myself will do it!    [_Lifting stick. Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS.]    PRINCE (_kneeling_). Your Majesty is safe!    GOOD WIFE (_aside_). What!--Your Majesty, they say!    SOLDIERS (_kneeling, joyfully_). King Alfred! King Alfred!    GOODWIFE (_aside)._ What!--King Alfred!--    KING. Rise, my Prince! Rise, my soldiers! Ah, I'm glad they did not find  you!    [_He grasps their hands._]    GOODWIFE (_aside; showing fear_). It is--it is--the king!    KING. We'll fight again, my men! At daybreak we'll surprise them.    SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!    KING. Goodwife, your king now thanks you.    GOODWIFE (_kneeling_). Oh, your Majesty, forgive me! forgive me!    KING (_gently_). Arise, goodwife.    GOODWIFE (_rising_). Alas the day I made you fry the cakes! Alas the day  I would have beaten you!    KING. Nay, goodwife, 'twas that saved my life. I bless the day you made  me fry the cakes! I bless the day you would have beaten me! (_Lifting  his hand over her head._)    And you I bless, goodwife, for your loyalty to England and her king!  Soldiers, salute this brave goodwife!    [_Soldiers form in a double line from door of hut, and hold"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16399"],[0,"A Winter Tour in South Africa (#9)"],[1,"Harbour Works, the Railway, and the Durban Town Hall are all works  of sufficient magnitude to give undoubted evidence of the public spirit  and unconquerable energy of the people of Natal.    The inhabitants of Durban are fortunate in possessing picturesque  surroundings to their pretty town. The \"Berea,\" one of its most  attractive spots, is an elevated suburb where many of the principal  merchants, and others have their residences. It commands a lovely  prospect over the bay, and a beautiful view of the country inland.    During, my stay at Durban I paid visits to two of the most remarkable  places in the neighbourhood. These were the Natal Central Sugar  Company's manufactory at Mount Edgcumbe, and the famous Trappist  establishment at Marionhill. The sugar manufactory is situated on a farm  of some 8,000 acres, about 15 miles from Durban. A short railway ride  brought me to it. I was courteously received by the manager, Monsieur  Dumat. This gentleman, a Frenchman of great experience in the  manufacture of sugar both in India and Mauritius, has been at Mount  Edgcumbe for the last ten years. He is remarkable for the way in which  he maintains order and control over all his numerous native workmen. In  the mill itself there are 160 men employed, everyone of whom is a  Coolie. There is not a single white man on the premises, excepting two  English clerks in the counting house. I was astonished at the perfect  order which reigned in the mill, where I spent some time. Everyone  appeared to perform his allotted task with activity, cheerfulness, and  untiring perseverance. Monsieur Dumat told me he could never get the  same steady work from white workmen. He seems to govern them all with  perfect tact and kindness. Some of them have been with him for many  years. There are about 900 other men, Kafirs and Coolies, employed on  the farm. I was shown all the various processes of sugar manufacture,  from the crushing of the cane, to the crystallising of the sugar. The  first sorts are ready for sale in forty-eight hours; other qualities  require a week, and again even as much as six months to perfect them.  There is some wonderful machinery in the mill.    The Trappist establishment at Marionhill is one which should be seen by  everyone visiting Natal. It is reached by rail from Durban in about an  hour's ride to the Pine Town station. A drive from thence of about four  miles brings a visitor to Marionhill. The monks, as is well known, are  under a vow of strict silence. I was met by one of them at the station,  who drove me in a waggonette to the Trappist farm. Here I was met by,  and presented to, the Abbot. He is the real leader and director of this  remarkable establishment. He devoted three hours to taking me over it,  and showing me all the various industries and works which are carried  on. About two hundred brothers are there at present, but more are  expected shortly, and upwards of one hundred sisters, and about three  hundred Kafirs. The latter are taught, not only the ordinary branches  of a practical education (of course including religion), but all sorts  of handicraft. It is, emphatically, a school of technical education.  Everything is manufactured and made at Marionhill, from the substantial  bullock wagons, and the delicate spiders, to the baking of bread, the  building of houses, stables, and cattle lairs, the printing of  periodicals, and book-binding. Work is the great and leading feature of  the Trappist creed. The motive power is religion. Its controlling  influence is here complete.    I came away quite amazed at all I saw, as well as pleased at the  attention I received from the Abbot. He is certainly a very remarkable  man, of great natural gifts, and indomitable energy and power. He is  sixty-five years of age. He was born on the shores of Lake Constance;  and before he took to studying for the Roman Catholic Church in a  German University, he was employed, as he told me, in early life in the  care of cattle at his native home.    The Trappist farm is beautifully situated, and within its area contains  some really fine scenery. The Kafir women's part of the establishment is  distinct, and quite half a mile distant from the men's quarters. Women  are taught to sew, and sing, to cut out and make dresses, to cook,  clean, and go through all the usual routine of household work. The  costume of the female Trappists, who, as well as the male, are highly  educated, is scarlet serge, with white aprons. The men are clothed in  brown serge.    I was struck with the admirable arrangement of the stables, constructed  for twenty horses, and of the cow and cattle sheds. All the engineering  works also show evidences of the complete knowledge of science possessed  by the \"brothers,\" and their energetic leader. I came away much  interested, and wonderfully impressed with all I had seen in this  remarkable institution.    Up to the present time the defences of the Colony have been in a very  backward state but I was glad to find that a battery is in course of  construction, commanding the entrance to the Bay, which is to be armed  with guns of the latest pattern, one of them having recently arrived at  Durban.    Having passed ten very pleasant days at Durban and its neighbourhood, I  embarked, on the 15th of August, on board the coasting steamer,  _Anglian_, for Port Elizabeth. I had a terrible experience of the  annoyance of the present mode of embarking passengers at Durban. After  attempting to get over the Bar in a tremendous sea, we were obliged to  put back into the Harbour thoroughly drenched. Once more attempting it,  we succeeded after another good wetting in getting alongside the  _Anglian_, where we remained at anchor until the morning, waiting for  the Cargo Boat we were obliged to leave behind, rolling and pitching all  night. The eastern coast of South Africa is subject to weather which is  often very rough and stormy; and I was, unluckily, destined to  experience it. I certainly had a most disagreeable time, in making this  short voyage. After touching at East London, where extensive harbour  works are being constructed, I was landed at Port Elizabeth (after three  days' knocking about at sea) on the 18th, being let down, like St. Paul,  in a basket, from the deck of the _Anglian_ to the tug, which took me to  the pier in the open roadstead. Right glad was I to get on _terra firma_  again.          [Illustration: Decorative]    PORT ELIZABETH.      Port Elizabeth (Algoa Bay) which is generally known as the \"Liverpool\"  of South Africa, is the chief seaport of the Eastern Province, its trade  being steadily increased by the development of the Transvaal Gold  Fields, and the growth of the interior towns of the Cape Colony. It is a  thriving business town. Its inhabitants, like those of Natal, are  thoroughly energetic and active in the pursuit of their various  mercantile avocations, and number about 12,000, a large proportion being  Europeans.    The town contains many fine buildings, the most conspicuous being the  Town Hall and Public Library combined, which is a striking edifice,  erected at a cost of L26,000. Attached to it is the market, leading out  of which is a splendid and capacious hall, 180 feet long by 90 feet  broad. Here I saw a curious and unique scene. Long tables were extended  along its entire length, on which were arranged large heaps of ostrich  feathers, carefully tied up, and sampled for sale. Port Elizabeth is the  staple market for this industry. The value of the feathers I saw, I was  told, was something fabulous.    Port Elizabeth is a handsome town. In the upper part of it, called the  Hill, there are many good private residences, and an excellent club  house, at which I stayed, and enjoyed the kind hospitality, courteously  extended to me.    A large, well kept, and conveniently laid out botanical garden, which  is much resorted to, is a great attraction to the town. There is also an  excellent hospital at Port Elizabeth. I was much pleased with its  appearance, and with the arrangements made for the comfort of the  patients. The ventilation struck me as being particularly perfect. There  is accommodation for 100 patients, male and female. A well-arranged  children's ward, attracts much attention, especially with the lady  visitors.    There is, in addition, a good water supply obtained from Van Staden's  River, distant about twenty-seven miles from the town, at a cost of  about L150,000.    There are several Churches, including Trinity Church, St. Augustine's  Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Scottish Presbyterian Church, and a  Congregational Church, upon which no less a sum than L7,715 was  expended.    Previously to leaving Port Elizabeth, the following address was  presented to me by the Fellows of the Royal Colonial Institute resident  there:--         TO SIR, FREDERICK YOUNG, K.C.M.G.,         _A Vice-President of the Royal Colonial Institute._         \"SIR,         \"We, the undersigned Fellows of the Royal Colonial Institute, take       advantage of your presence amongst us to join in the expression of       hearty welcome to South Africa, which has greeted you in the       several towns where you have met the Members of the Institute, with       which you have been so long and honourably connected.         \"We are mindful of the valuable services which you have so long       rendered to our Institute, as Honorary Secretary, the indefatigable       zeal ever displayed by you in forwarding the interests of the       Colonies of Great Britain; and that the success of the       Institution, over which you now preside, as one of the       Vice-Presidents, is in no small degree due to your exertions.
