For spirits of the best mettle,  and especially for a woman's heart, impotent passion is a heavy burden to  bear; and Valentine Visconti, beautiful, amiable, and unhappy even in her  best days through the fault of the husband she loved, sank under this  trial.  At the close of her life she had taken for device, \"Nought have I  more; more hold I nought\" (Bien ne m 'est plus; plus ne m 'est rien);  and so fully was that her habitual feeling that she had the words  inscribed upon the black tapestry of her chamber.  In her last hours she  had by her side her three sons and her daughter, but there was another  still whom she remembered.  She sent for a child, six years of age, John,  a natural son of her husband by Marietta d'Enghien, wife of Sire de  Cany-Dunois.  \"This one,\" said she, \"was filched from me; yet there is  not a child so well cut out as he to avenge his father's death.\"  Twenty-five years later John was the famous Bastard of Orleans, Count  Dunois, Charles VII.'s lieutenant-general, and Joan of Arc's comrade in  the work of saving the French kingship and France.    [Illustration: Death of Valentine de Milan----45]    The Duke of Burgundy's negotiations at Tours were not fruitless.  The  result was, that on the 9th of March, 1409, a treaty was concluded and an  interview effected at Chartres between the duke on one side and on the  other the king, the queen, the _dauphin_, all the royal family, the  councillors of the crown, the young Duke of Orleans, his brother, and a  hundred knights of their house, all met together to hear the king declare  that he pardoned the Duke of Burgundy.  The duke prayed \"my lord of  Orleans and my lords his brothers to banish from their hearts all hatred  and vengeance;\" and the princes of Orleans \"assented to what the king  commanded them, and forgave their cousin the Duke of Burgundy everything  entirely.\"  On the way back from Chartres the Duke of Burgundy's fool  kept playing with a church-paten (called \"peace\"), and thrusting it under  his cloak, saying, \"See, this is a cloak of peace;\" and, \"Many folks,\"  says Juvenal des Ursins, \"considered this fool pretty wise.\"  The Duke of  Burgundy had good reason, however, for seeking this outward  reconciliation; it put an end to a position too extended not to become  pretty soon untenable; the peace was a cause of great joy at Paris; the  king was not long coming back; and two hundred thousand persons, says the  chronicle, went out to meet him, shouting, \"Noel!\" The Duke of Burgundy  had gone out to receive him; and the queen and the princes arrived two  days after-wards.  It was not known at the time, though it was perhaps  the most serious result of the negotiation, that a secret understanding  had been established between John the Fearless and Isabel of Bavaria.  The queen, as false as she was dissolute, had seen that the duke might be  of service to her on occasion if she served him in her turn, and they had  added the falsehood of their undivulged arrangement to that of the  general reconciliation.    But falsehood does not extinguish the facts it attempts to disguise.  The  hostility between the houses of Orleans and Burgundy could not fail to  survive the treaty of Chartres, and cause search to be made for a man to  head the struggle so soon as it could be recommenced.  The hour and the  man were not long waited for.  In the very year of the treaty, Charles of  Orleans, eldest son of the murdered duke and Valentine of Milan, lost his  wife, Isabel of France, daughter of Charles VI.; and as early as the  following year (1410) the princes, his uncles, made him marry Bonne  d'Armagnac, daughter of Count Bernard d'Armagnac, one of the most  powerful, the most able, and the most ambitious lords of Southern France.  Forthwith, in concert with the Duke of Berry, the Duke of Brittany, and  several other lords, Count Bernard put himself at the head of the Orleans  party, and prepared to proceed against the Duke of Burgundy in the cause  of dominion combined with vengeance.  From 1410 to 1415 France was a prey  to civil war between the Armagnacs and Burgundians, and to their  alternate successes and reverses brought about by the unscrupulous  employment of the most odious and desperate means.  The Burgundians had  generally the advantage in the struggle, for Paris was chiefly the centre  of it, and their influence was predominant there.  Their principal allies  there were the butchers, the boldest and most ambitious corporation in  the city.  For a long time the butcher-trade of Paris had been in the  hands of a score of families the number had been repeatedly reduced, and  at the opening of the fifteenth century, three families, the Legoix, the  St. Yons, and the Thiberts, had exercised absolute mastery in the market  district, which in turn exercised mastery over nearly the whole city.  \"One Caboche, a flayer of beasts in the shambles of Hotel-Dieu, and  Master John de Troyes, a surgeon with a talent for speaking, were their  most active associates.  Their company consisted of 'prentice-butchers,  medical students, skinners, tailors, and every kind of lewd fellows.  When anybody caused their displeasure they said, 'Here's an Armagnac,'  and despatched him on the spot, and plundered his house, or dragged him  off to prison to pay dear for his release.  The rich burgesses lived in  fear and peril.  More than three hundred of them went off to Melun with  the provost of tradesmen, who could no longer answer for the tranquillity  of the city.\"  The Armagnacs, in spite of their general inferiority,  sometimes got the upper hand, and did not then behave with much more  discretion than the others.  They committed the mistake of asking aid  from the King of England, \"promising him the immediate surrender of all  the cities, castles, and bailiwicks they still possessed in Guienne and  Poitou.\"  Their correspondence fell into the hands of the Burgundians,  and the Duke of Burgundy showed the king himself a letter stating that  \"the Duke of Berry, the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke of Bourbon had  lately conspired together at Bourges for the destruction of the king, the  kingdom, and the good city of Paris.\"  \"Ah!\" cried the poor king with  tears, \"we quite see their wickedness, and we do conjure you, who are of  our own blood, to aid and advise us against them.\"  The duke and his  partisans, kneeling on one knee, promised the king all the assistance  possible with their persons and their property.  The civil war was  passionately carried on.  The Burgundians went and besieged Bourges.  The  siege continued a long while without success.  Some of the besiegers grew  weary of it.  Negotiations were opened with the besieged.  An interview  took place before the walls between the Duke of Berry and the Duke of  Burgundy.  \"Nephew,\" said the former, \"I have acted ill, and you still  worse.  It is for us to try and maintain the kingdom in peace and  prosperity.\"  \"I will be no obstacle, uncle,\" answered Duke John.  Peace  was made.  It was stipulated that the Duke of Berry and the Armagnac  lords should give up all alliance with the English, and all confederacy  against the Duke of Burgundy, who, on his side, should give up any that  he might have formed against them.  An engagement was entered into  mutually to render aid, service, and obedience to the king against his  foe of England, as they were bound by right and reason to do; and lastly  a promise was made to observe the articles of the peace of Chartres, and  to swear them over again.  There was a special prohibition against using,  for the future, the words Armagnacs and Burgundians, or any other term  reflecting upon either party.  The pacification was solemnly celebrated  at Auxerre, on the 22d of August, 1412; and on the 29th of September  following, the _dauphin_ once more entered Paris, with the Duke of  Burgundy at his side.  The king, queen, and Duke of Berry arrived a few  days afterwards.  The people gave a hearty reception to them, even to the  Armagnacs, well known as such, in their train; but the butchers and the  men of their faction murmured loudly, and treated the peace as treason.  Outside, it was little more than nominal; the Count of Armagnac remained  under arms and the Duke of Orleans held aloof from Paris.  A violent  ferment again began there.  The butchers continued to hold the mastery.  The Duke of Burgundy, all the while finding them very much in the way,  did not cease to pay court to them, Many of his knights were highly  displeased at seeing themselves mixed up with such fellows.  The honest  burgesses began to be less frightened at the threats and more angry at  the excesses of the butchers.  The advocate-general, Juvenal des Ursins,  had several times called without being received at the Hotel d'Artois,  but one night the Duke of Burgundy sent for him, and asked him what he  thought of the position.  \"My lord,\" said the magistrate, \"do not persist  in always maintaining that you did well to have the Duke of Orleans  slain; enough mischief has come of it to make you agree that you were  wrong.  It is not to your honor to let yourself be guided by flayers of  beasts and a lot of lewd fellows.  I can guarantee that a hundred  burgesses of Paris, of the highest character, would undertake to attend  you everywhere, and do whatever you should bid them, and even lend you  money if you wanted it.\"  The duke listened patiently, but answered that  he had done no wrong in the case of the Duke of Orleans, and would never  confess that he had.  \"As to the fellows of whom you speak,\" said he,  \"I know my own business.\"  Juvenal returned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#9)"],[1,"King of England took the King of France by the collar, and  said to him, 'Brother, I should like to wrestle with you,' and gave him a  feint or two; and the King of France, who is a mighty good wrestler, gave  him a turn and threw him on the ground.  And the King of England would  have had yet another trial; but all that was broken off, and it was time  to go to supper.  After this they had yet three or four jousts and  banquets, and then they took leave of one another [on the 24th of June,  1520], with the greatest possible peace between the princes and  princesses.  That done, the King of England returned to Guines, and the  King of France to France; and it was not without giving great gifts at  parting, one to another.\"  [_Memoires de Fleuranges,_ pp.  349-363.]    [Illustration: The Field of the Cloth of Gold----45]    Having left the Field of Cloth of Gold for Amboise, his favorite  residence, Francis I. discovered that Henry VIII., instead of returning  direct to England, had gone, on the 10th of July, to Gravelines, in  Flanders, to pay a visit to Charles V., who had afterwards accompanied  him to Calais.  The two sovereigns had spent three days there, and  Charles V., on separating from the King of England, had commissioned him  to regulate, as arbiter, all difficulties that might arise between  himself and the King of France.  Assuredly nothing was less calculated to  inspire Francis I. with confidence in the results of his meeting with  Henry VIII. and of their mutual courtesies.  Though he desired to avoid  the appearance of taking the initiative in war, he sought every occasion  and pretext for recommencing it; and it was not long before he found them  in the Low Countries, in Navarre, and in Italy.  A trial was made of  Henry VIII.'s mediation and of a conference at Calais; and a discussion  was raised touching the legitimate nature of the protection afforded by  the two rival sovereigns to their petty allies.  But the real fact was,  that Francis I. had a reverse to make up for and a passion to gratify;  and the struggle recommenced in April, 1521, in the Low Countries.  Charles V., when he heard that the French had crossed his frontier,  exclaimed, \"God be praised that I am not the first to commence the war,  and that the King of France is pleased to make me greater than I am, for,  in a little while, either I shall be a very poor emperor or he will be a  poor King of France.\"  The campaign opened in the north, to the advantage  of France, by the capture of Hesdin; Admiral Bonnivet, who had the  command on the frontier of Spain, reduced some small forts of Biscay and  the fortress of Fontarabia; and Marshal de Lautrec, governor of Milaness,  had orders to set out at once to go and defend it against the Spaniards  and Imperialists, who were concentrating for its invasion.    Lautrec was but little adapted for this important commission.  He had  been made governor of Milaness in August, 1516, to replace the Constable  de Bourbon, whose recall to France the queen-mother, Louise of Savoy, had  desired and stimulated.  Lautrec had succeeded ill in his government.  He  was active and brave, but he was harsh, haughty, jealous, imperious, and  grasping; and he had embroiled himself with most of the Milanese lords,  amongst others with the veteran J. J. Trivulzio, who, under Charles VIII.  and Louis XII., had done France such great service in Italy.  Trivulzio,  offensively treated at Milan, and subjected to accusations at Paris,  went, at eighty-two years of age, to France to justify himself before the  king; but Francis I. gave him a cold reception, barely spoke to him, and  declined his explanations.  One day, at Arpajon, Trivulzio heard that the  king was to pass on horseback through the town; and, being unable to  walk, had himself carried, ill as he was, in his chair to the middle of  the street.  The king passed with averted head, and without replying to  Trivulzio, who cried, \"Sir, ah! sir, just one moment's audience!\"  Trivulzio, on reaching home, took to his bed, and died there a month  afterwards, on the 5th of December, 1518, having himself dictated this  epitaph, which was inscribed on his tomb, at Milan, \"J. J. Trivulzio, son  of Anthony: he who never rested, rests.  Hush!\" [_J. J. Trivultius,  Antonii filius, qui nunquam quievit, quiescit.  Tace!_]    Francis I., when informed that Trivulzio was near his end, regretted, it  is said, his harsh indifference, and sent to express to him his regret;  but, \"It is too late,\" answered the dying man.  In the king's harshness  there was something more than ungrateful forgetfulness of a veteran's  ancient services.  While Francis was bringing about a renewal of war in  Italy, in the Low Countries, and on the frontier of Spain, he was  abandoning himself at Paris, Tours, Amboise, and wherever he resided, to  all the diversions and all the enticements of the brilliant court which  was gathered around him.  Extravagance and pleasure were a passion with  him.  \"There has been talk,\" says Brantome, \"of the great outlay,  magnificence, sumptuousness and halls of Lucullus; but in nought of that  kind did he ever come near our king .  .  .  and what is most rare is,  that in a village, in the forest, at the meet, there was the same service  as there would have been in Paris.  .  .  .  One day, when the king was  expecting the Emperor Charles to dinner, word came that he had slipped  away, and had gone to give a sudden surprise to the constable, just as he  was sitting down to table, and to dine with him and all his comrades  comradewise.  He found this table as well furnished and supplied, and  laden with victuals as well cooked and flavored, as if they had been in  Paris or some other good city of France; whereat the emperor was so  mightily astonished that he said that there was no such grandeur in the  world as that of such a King of France.  .  .  .  In respect of ladies,  of a surety it must be confessed that before the time of King Francis  they set foot in and frequented the court but little and in but small  numbers.  It is true that Queen Anne (of Brittany) began to make her  ladies' court larger than it had been under former queens; and, without  her, the king her husband (Louis XII.) would have taken no trouble about  it.  But Francis I., coming to reign, and considering that the whole  grace of the court was the ladies, was pleased to fill it up with them  more than had been the ancient custom.  Since, in truth, a court without  ladies is a garden without any pretty flowers, and more resembles a  Satrap's or a Turk's court than that of a great Christian king.  .  .  .  As for me, I hold that there was never anything better introduced than  the ladies' court.  Full often have I seen our kings go to camp, or town,  or elsewhither, remain there and divert themselves for some days, and yet  take thither no ladies.  But we were so bewildered, so lost, so moped,  that for the week we spent away from them and their pretty eyes it  appeared to us a year; and always a-wishing, 'When shall we be at the  court?'  Not, full often, calling that the court where the king was, but  that where the queen and ladies were.\"  [_OEuvres de Brantome, edition of  the Societe de l'Histoire de France,_ t. iii.  pp. 120-129.]    Now, when so many fair ladies are met together in a life of sumptuousness  and gayety, a king is pretty sure to find favorites, and royal favorites  rarely content themselves with pleasing the king; they desire to make  their favor serviceable their family and their friends.  Francis I.  had  made choice one, Frances de Foix, countess of Chateaubriant, beautiful  ambitious, dexterous, haughty, readily venturing upon rivalry with even  the powerful queen-mother.  She had three brothers; Lautrec was one of  the three, and she supported him in all his pretensions and all his  trials of fortune.  When he set out to go and take the command in Italy,  he found himself at the head of an army numerous indeed, but badly  equipped, badly paid, and at grips with Prosper Colonna, the most able  amongst the chiefs of the coalition formed at this juncture between  Charles V. and Pope Leo X. against the French.  Lautrec did not succeed  in preventing Milan from falling into the hands of the Imperialists, and,  after an uncertain campaign of some months' duration, he lost at La  Bicocca, near Monza, on the 27th of April, 1522, a battle, which left in  the power of Francis I., in Lombardy, only the citadels of Milan,  Cremona, and Novara.  At the news of these reverses, Francis I. repaired  to Lyons, to consult as to the means of applying a remedy.  Lautrec also  arrived there.  \"The king,\" says Martin du Bellay, \"gave him a bad  reception, as the man by whose fault he considered he had lost his duchy  of Milan, and would not speak to him.\"  Lautrec found an occasion for  addressing the king, and complained vehemently of \"the black looks he  gave him.\"  \"And good reason,\" said the king, \"when you have lost me such  a heritage as the duchy of Milan.\"  \"'Twas not I who lost it,\" answered  Lautrec; \"'twas your Majesty yourself: I several times warned you that,  if I were not helped with money, there was no means of retaining the  men-at-arms, who had served for eighteen months without a penny, and  likewise the Swiss, who forced me to fight at a disadvantage, which they  would never have done if they had received their pay.\"  \"I sent you four  hundred thousand crowns when you asked for them.\"  \"I received the  letters in which your Majesty notified me of this money, but the money  never.\"  The king sent at once for the superintendent-general of finance,  James de Beaune, Baron of Semblancay, who acknowledged having received  orders on the subject from the king, but added that at the very moment  when he was about to send this sum to the army, the queen-mother had come  and asked him for it, and had received it from him, whereof he was ready  to make oath.
