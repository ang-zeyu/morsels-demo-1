Towards the south-east, high up above the horizon, we see the twin-stars  Castor and Pollux. The upper is Castor, the finest double star visible  in the northern heavens. The components are nearly equal and rather more  than 5\" apart (see Plate 3). Both are white according to the best  observers, but the smaller is thought by some to be slightly greenish.    Pollux is a coarse but fine triple star (in large instruments multiple).  The components orange, grey, and lilac.    There are many other fine objects in Gemini, but we pass to Cancer.    The fine cluster Praesepe in Cancer may easily be found as it is  distinctly visible to the naked eye in the position shown in Plate 1,  Map I. In the telescope it is seen as shown in Plate 3.    The star [iota] Cancri is a wide double, the colours orange and blue.    Procyon, the first-magnitude star between Praesepe and Sirius, is finely  coloured--yellow with a distant orange companion, which appears to be  variable.    Below the Twins, almost in a line with them, is the star [alpha] Hydrae,  called Al Fard, or \"the Solitary One.\" It is a 2nd magnitude variable. I  mention it, however, not on its own account, but as a guide to the fine  double [epsilon] Hydrae. This star is the middle one of a group of three,  lying between Pollux and Al Fard rather nearer the latter. The  components of [epsilon] Hydrae are separated by about 3-1/2\" (see Plate  3). The primary is of the fourth, the companion of the eighth magnitude;  the former is yellow, the latter a ruddy purple. The period of [epsilon]  Hydrae is about 450 years.    The constellation Leo Minor, now due east and about midway between the  horizon and the zenith, is well worth sweeping over. It contains several  fine fields.    Let us next turn to the western heavens. Here there are some noteworthy  objects.    To begin with, there are the Pleiades, showing to the naked eye only six  or seven stars. In the telescope the Pleiades appear as shown in Plate  3.    The Hyades also show some fine fields with low powers.    Aldebaran, the principal star of the Hyades, as also of the  constellation Taurus, is a noted red star. It is chiefly remarkable for  the close spectroscopic analysis to which it has been subjected by  Messrs. Huggins and Miller. Unlike Betelgeuse, the spectrum of Aldebaran  exhibits the lines corresponding to hydrogen, and no less than eight  metals--sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium, antimony,  and mercury, are proved to exist in the constitution of this brilliant  red star.    On the right of Aldebaran, in the position indicated in Plate 1, Map I.,  are the stars [zeta] and [beta] Tauri. If with a low power the observer  sweep from [zeta] towards [beta], he will soon find--not far from [zeta]  (at a distance of about one-sixth of the distance separating [beta] from  [zeta]), the celebrated Crab nebula, known as 1 M. This was the first  nebula discovered by Messier, and its discovery led to the formation of  his catalogue of 103 nebulae. In a small telescope this object appears as  a nebulous light of oval form, no traces being seen of the wisps and  sprays of light presented in Lord Rosse's well known picture of the  nebula.    Here I shall conclude the labours of our first half-hour among the  stars, noticing that the examination of Plate 1 will show what other  constellations besides those here considered are well situated for  observation at this season. It will be remarked that many constellations  well seen in the third half-hour (Chapter IV.) are favourably seen in  the first also, and _vice versa_. For instance, the constellation Ursa  Major well-placed towards the north-east in the first quarter of the  year, is equally well-placed towards the north-west in the third, and  similarly of the constellation Cassiopeia. The same relation connects  the second and fourth quarters of the year.    [Illustration: PLATE III.]          CHAPTER III.    A HALF-HOUR WITH LYRA, HERCULES, CORVUS, CRATER, ETC.      The observations now to be commenced are supposed to take place during  the second quarter of the year,--at ten o'clock on the 20th of April, or  at nine on the 5th of May, or at eight on the 21st of May, or at seven  on the 5th of June, or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate  days.    We again look first for the Great Bear, now near the zenith, and thence  find the Pole-star. Turning towards the north, we see Cassiopeia between  the Pole-star and the horizon. Towards the north-west is the brilliant  Capella, and towards the north-east the equally brilliant Vega, beneath  which, and somewhat northerly, is the cross in Cygnus. The Milky Way  passes from the eastern horizon towards the north (low down), and so  round to the western horizon.    In selecting a region for special observation, we shall adopt a  different plan from that used in the preceding \"half-hour.\" The region  on the equator and towards the south is indeed particularly interesting,  since it includes the nebular region in Virgo. Within this space nebulae  are clustered more closely than over any corresponding space in the  heavens, save only the greater Magellanic cloud. But to the observer  with telescopes of moderate power these nebulae present few features of  special interest; and there are regions of the sky now well situated for  observation, which, at most other epochs are either low down towards  the horizon or inconveniently near to the zenith. We shall therefore  select one of these, the region included in the second map of Plate 2,  and the neighbouring part of the celestial sphere.    At any of the hours above named, the constellation Hercules lies towards  the east. A quadrant taken from the zenith to the eastern horizon passes  close to the last star ([eta]) of the Great Bear's tail, through [beta],  a star in Bootes' head, near [beta] Herculis, between the two \"Alphas\"  which mark the heads of Hercules and Ophiuchus, and so past [beta]  Ophiuchi, a third-magnitude star near the horizon. And here we may turn  aside for a moment to notice the remarkable vertical row of six  conspicuous stars towards the east-south-east; these are, counting them  in order from the horizon, [zeta], [epsilon], and [delta] Ophiuchi,  [epsilon], [alpha], and [delta] Serpentis.    Let the telescope first be directed towards Vega. This orb presents a  brilliant appearance in the telescope. Its colour is a bluish-white. In  an ordinary telescope Vega appears as a single star, but with a large  object-glass two distant small companions are seen. A nine-inch glass  shows also two small companions within a few seconds of Vega. In the  great Harvard refractor Vega is seen with no less than thirty-five  companions. I imagine that all these stars, and others which can be seen  in neighbouring fields, indicate the association of Vega with the  neighbouring stream of the Milky Way.    Let our observer now direct his telescope to the star [epsilon] Lyrae. Or  rather, let him first closely examine this star with the naked eye. The  star is easily identified, since it lies to the left of Vega, forming  with [zeta] a small equilateral triangle. A careful scrutiny suffices to  indicate a peculiarity in this star. If our observer possesses very  good eye-sight, he will distinctly recognise it as a \"naked-eye double\";  but more probably he will only notice that it appears lengthened in a  north and south direction.[4] In the finder the star is easily divided.  Applying a low power to the telescope itself, we see [epsilon] Lyrae as a  wide double, the line joining the components lying nearly north and  south. The southernmost component (the upper in the figure) is called  [epsilon]^{1}, the other [epsilon]^{2}. Seen as a double, both  components appear white.    Now, if the observer's telescope is sufficiently powerful, each of the  components may be seen to be itself double. First try [epsilon]^{1}, the  northern pair. The line joining the components is directed as shown in  Plate 3. The distance between them is 3\".2, their magnitudes 5 and  6-1/2, and their colours yellow and ruddy. If the observer succeeds in  seeing [epsilon]^{1} fairly divided, he will probably not fail in  detecting the duplicity of [epsilon]^{2}, though this is a rather closer  pair, the distance between the components being only 2\".6. The  magnitudes are 5 and 5-1/2, both being white. Between [epsilon]^{1} and  [epsilon]^{2} are three faint stars, possibly forming with the quadruple  a single system.    Let us next turn to the third star of the equilateral triangle mentioned  above--viz. to the star [zeta] Lyrae. This is a splendid but easy double.  It is figured in Plate 3, but it must be noticed that the figure of  [zeta] and the other nine small figures are not drawn on the same scale  as [epsilon] Lyrae. The actual distance between the components of [zeta]  Lyra is 44\", or about one-fourth of the distance separating  [epsilon]^{1} from [epsilon]^{2}. The components of [zeta] are very  nearly equal in magnitude, in colour topaz and green, the topaz  component being estimated as of the fifth magnitude, the green component  intermediate between the fifth and sixth magnitudes.    We may now turn to a star not figured in the map, but readily found. It  will be noticed that the stars [epsilon], [alpha], [beta], and [gamma]  form, with two small stars towards the left, a somewhat regular  hexagonal figure--a hexagon, in fact, having three equal long sides and  three nearly equal short sides alternating with the others. The star  [eta] Lyrae forms the angle next to [epsilon]. It is a wide and unequal  double, as figured in Plate 3. The larger component is azure blue; the  smaller is violet, and, being only of the ninth magnitude, is somewhat  difficult to catch with apertures under 3 inches.    The star [delta]^{2} Lyrae is orange, [delta]^{1} blue."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16772"],[0,"The Story of a Soul (L'Histoire d'une Âme): The Autobiography of St. Thérèse of (#9)"],[1,"Celine and I altered when we came to  Lisieux. She had now become the little romp, full of mischief,  while Therese had turned into a very quiet little girl, far too  much inclined to tears. I needed a champion, and who can say how  courageously my dear little sister played that part. We used to  enjoy making each other little presents, for, at that age, the  simplicity of our hearts was unspoiled. Like the spring flowers  they unfolded, glad to receive the morning dew, while the same  soft breezes swayed their petals. Yes, our joys were mutual. I  felt this especially on the happy day of Celine's First Communion;  I was only seven years old, and had not yet begun school at the  Abbey. How sweet is the remembrance of her preparation! Every  evening during its last weeks my sisters talked to her of the  great event. I listened, eager to prepare myself too, and my heart  swelled with grief when I was told to go away because I was still  too young. I thought that four years was not too long to spend in  making ready to receive Our dear Lord. One evening I heard someone  say to my happy little sister: \"From the time of your First  Communion you must begin an entirely new life.\" At once I made a  resolution not to wait till the time of my First Communion, but to  begin with Celine. During her retreat she remained as a boarder at  the Abbey, and it seemed to me she was away a long time; but at  last the happy day came. What a delightful impression it has left  on my mind--it was like a foretaste of my own First Communion! How  many graces I received that day! I look on it as one of the most  beautiful of my life.    I have gone back a little in order to recall these happy memories;  but now I must tell you of the mournful parting which crushed my  heart when Our Lord took from me my little Mother whom I loved so  dearly. I told her once that I would like to go away with her to a  far-off desert; she replied that it was her wish too, but that she  was waiting till I was big enough to set out. This impossible  promise I took in earnest, and what was my grief when I heard  Pauline talking to Marie about soon entering the Carmel! I did not  know the Carmel; but I knew that she was leaving me to enter a  convent, and that she would not wait for me.    How can I describe the anguish I suffered! In a flash I saw life  spread out before me as it really is, full of sufferings and  frequent partings, and I shed bitter tears. At that time I did not  know the joy of sacrifice; I was weak--so weak that I look on it  as a great grace that I was able to bear such a trial, one  seemingly so much beyond my strength--and yet live. I shall never  forget how tenderly my little Mother consoled me, while explaining  the religious life. Then one evening, when I was thinking over the  picture she had drawn, I felt that the Carmel was the desert where  God wished me also to hide. I felt this so strongly that I had not  the least doubt about it; nor was it a childish dream, but the  certainty of a Divine Call. This impression, which I cannot  properly describe, left me with a feeling of great inward peace.    Next day I confided my desires to Pauline. They seemed to her as a  proof of God's Will, and she promised to take me soon to the  Carmel, to see the Mother Prioress and to tell her my secret. This  solemn visit was fixed for a certain Sunday, and great was my  embarrassment on hearing that my cousin Marie--who was still young  enough to be allowed to see the Carmelites--was to come with us.[2]    I had to contrive a means of being alone with the Reverend Mother,  and this is what I planned. I told Marie, that, as we were to have  the great privilege of seeing her, we must be very good and  polite, and tell her our little secrets, and in order to do that,  we must go out of the room in turns. Though she did not quite like  it, because she had no secrets to confide, Marie took me at my  word, and so I was able to be alone with you, dear Mother. You  listened to my great disclosure, and believed in my vocation, but  you told me that postulants were not received at the age of nine,  and that I must wait till I was sixteen. In spite of my ardent  desire to enter with Pauline and make my First Communion on her  clothing day, I had to be resigned.    At last the 2nd of October came--a day of tears, but also of  blessings, when Our Lord gathered the first of His flowers, the  chosen flower who, later on, was to become the Mother of her  sisters.[3] Whilst Papa, with my uncle and Marie, climbed the  mountain of Carmel to offer his first sacrifice, my aunt took me  to Mass, with my sisters and cousins. We were bathed in tears, and  people gazed at us in astonishment when we entered the church, but  that did not stop our crying. I even wondered how the sun could go  on shining. Perhaps, dear Mother, you think I exaggerate my grief  a little. I confess that this parting ought not to have upset me  so much, but my soul was yet far from mature, and I had to pass  through many trials before reaching the haven of peace, before  tasting the delicious fruits of perfect love and of complete  abandonment to God's Will.    In the afternoon of that October day, 1882, behind the grating of  the Carmel, I saw my beloved Pauline, now become Sister Agnes of  Jesus. Oh, how much I suffered in that parlour! As I am writing  the story of my soul, it seems to me that I ought to tell you  everything. Well, I acknowledge that I hardly counted the first  pains of this parting, in comparison with those which followed. I,  who had been accustomed to talk with my little Mother of all that  was in my heart, could now scarcely snatch two or three minutes  with her at the end of the family visits; even these short minutes  were passed in tears, and I went away with my heart torn with  grief.    I did not realise that it was impossible to give us each half an  hour, and that of course Papa and Marie must have the largest  share. I could not understand all this, and I said from the depths  of my heart: \"Pauline is lost to me.\"    This suffering so affected me that I soon became seriously ill.  The illness was undoubtedly the work of the devil, who, in his  fury at this first entry into the Carmel, tried to avenge himself  on me for the great harm my family was to do him in the future.  However, he little knew that the Queen of Heaven was watching  faithfully over her Little Flower, that she was smiling upon it  from on high, ready to still the tempest just when the delicate  and fragile stalk was in danger of being broken once and for all.  At the close of the year 1882 I began to suffer from constant  headaches; they were bearable, however, and did not prevent me  from continuing my studies. This lasted till the Easter of 1883.  Just then Papa went to Paris with my elder sisters, and confided  Celine and me to the care of our uncle and aunt. One evening I was  alone with my uncle, and he talked so tenderly of my Mother and of  bygone days that I was deeply moved and began to cry. My  sensitiveness touched him too; he was surprised that one of my age  should feel as I did. So he determined to do all he could to  divert my mind during the holidays.    But God had decided otherwise. That very evening my headache  became acute, and I was seized with a strange shivering which  lasted all night. My aunt, like a real mother, never left me for a  moment; all through my illness she lavished on me the most tender  and devoted care. You may imagine my poor Father's grief when he  returned from Paris to find me in this hopeless state; he thought  I was going to die, but Our Lord might have said to him: \"This  sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God.\"[4]    Yes, God was glorified by means of this trial, by the wonderful  resignation of my Father and sisters. And to Marie especially what  suffering it brought, and how grateful I am to this dear sister!  She seemed to divine my wants by instinct, for a mother's heart is  more knowing than the science of the most skilful doctors.    And now Pauline's clothing day was drawing near; but, fearing to  distress me, no one dared mention it in my presence, since it was  taken for granted that I should not be well enough to be there.  Deep down in my heart, however, I firmly believed that God would  give me the consolation of seeing dear Pauline on that day. I was  quite sure that this feast would be unclouded; I knew that Our  Lord would not try His Spouse by depriving her of my presence, she  had already suffered so much on account of my illness. And so it  turned out. I was there, able to embrace my dear little Mother, to  sit on her knee, and, hiding myself under her veil, to receive her  loving caresses. I was able to feast my eyes upon her--she looked  so lovely in her veil and mantle of white. Truly it was a day of  happiness in the midst of heavy trials; but this day, or rather  this hour, passed only too quickly, and soon we were in the  carriage which was to take us away from the Carmel. On reaching  home I was made to lie down, though I did not feel at all tired;  but next day I had a serious relapse, and became so ill that,  humanly speaking, there was no hope of any recovery.    I do not know how to describe this extraordinary illness. I said  things which I had never thought of; I acted as though I were  forced to act in spite of myself; I seemed nearly always to be  delirious; and yet I feel certain that I was never, for a minute,  deprived of my reason. Sometimes I remained in a state of extreme  exhaustion for hours together, unable to make the least movement,  and yet, in spite of this extraordinary torpor, hearing the least  whisper. I remember it still. And what fears the devil inspired! I  was afraid of everything; my bed seemed to be surrounded by  frightful precipices; nails in the wall took the terrifying  appearance of long fingers, shrivelled and blackened with fire,  making me cry out in terror. One day,"]]]
