Happily, no one ever went Quite So Far. She invariably Escaped.    MORAL: _Don't Worry._          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ REGULAR CUSTOMER _AND THE_ COPPER-LINED ENTERTAINER      One day the Main Works of a Wholesale House was Jacking Up the Private  Secretary and getting ready to close his desk for the Day, when in blew  a Country Customer. The Head of the Concern would have given Seven  Dollars if he could have got out and caught the Elevated before the  Country Customer showed up. However, he was Politic, and he knew he must  not throw down a Buyer who discounted his Bills and was good as Old  Wheat. So he gave a Correct Imitation of a Man who is tickled nearly to  Death. After calling the Country Customer \"Jim,\" he made him sit down  and tell him about the Family, and the Crops, and Collections, and the  Prospects for Duck-Shooting. Then, selecting an opportune moment, he  threw up Both Hands. He said he had almost forgotten the Vestry Meeting  at Five O'clock, and going out to Dinner at Six-Thirty. He was about to  Call Off the Vestry Meeting, the Dinner, and all other Engagements for a  Week to come, but Jim would not Listen to it. As a Compromise the Head  of the Concern said he would ask their Mr. Byrd to take charge of the  Country Customer. They could surely find some Way of putting in the  Evening. He said the Oratorio Club war going to sing at Music Hall, and  also there was a Stereopticon Lecture on India. Jim said he would prefer  the Stereopticon Show, because he loved to look at Pictures.    The Head of the Concern said that the Country Customer would be sure to  like their Mr. Byrd. Everybody liked Byrd. His Full Name was Mr. Knight  Byrd.    He pushed on a few Buttons and blew into several snaky Tubes and put the  whole Shop on the Jump to find Mr. Byrd. The latter happened to be in a  Rathskeller not far away. When he heard that there was Work to be done  in his Department he brushed away the Crumbs and Hot-Footed up to see  the Boss.    In presenting Mr. Byrd to the Country Customer the Head of the Concern  laid it on with a Shovel. He said that Jim Here was his Friend, and the  House considered it an Honor to Entertain him. The Country Customer sat  there feeling Sheepish and Unworthy but a good deal Puffed Up just the  same. Then the Head of the Firm made his Escape and the Country Customer  was in the Hands of Mr. Byrd.    Mr. Byrd was known in the Establishment as the Human Expense Account. No  one had ever accused him of being a Quitter. He was supposed to be  Hollow inside. Whenever any Friend of the Firm showed up, Mr. Byrd was  called upon to take charge of him and Entertain him to a Stand-Still.  The Boss was troubled with Dyspepsia, and Conscientious Scruples, and a  Growing Family, and a few other Items that prevented him from going out  at Night with the Visiting Trade. He had it arranged to give each one of  them a choice Mess of Beautiful Language and then pass him along to Mr.  Byrd.    Mr. Byrd was a Rosy and Red-Headed Gentleman, with a slight Overhang  below the Shirt Front. He breathed like a Rusty Valve every time he had  to go up a Stairway, but he had plenty of Endurance of another Kind. For  Years he had been playing his Thirst against his Capacity, and it was  still a Safe Bet, whichever Way you wanted to place your Money. His  Batting Average was about Seven Nights to the Week. He discovered that  Alcohol was a Food long before the Medical Journals got onto it.    Mr. Byrd's chief value to the Wholesale House lay in the Fact that he  could Meet all Comers and close up half the Places in Town, and then  show up next Morning with a Clean Collar and a White Carnation, and send  in word to lead out another Country Customer.    Mr. Byrd's first Move was to take Jim to a Retreat that was full of  Statuary and Paintings. It was owned by a gray-haired Beau named Bob,  who was a Ringer for a United States Senator, all except the White Coat.  Bob wanted to show them a new Tall One called the Mamie Taylor, and  after they had Sampled a Couple Jim said it was all right and he  believed he would take one. Then he told Bob how much he had taken in  the Year before and what his Fixtures cost him, and if anybody didn't  think he was Good they could look him up in Bradstreet or Dun, that was  all. He said he was a Gentleman, and that no Cheap Skate in a Plug Hat  could tell him where to Get Off. This last Remark was intended for an  inoffensive Person who had slipped in to get a Rhine Wine and Seltzer,  and was pronging about Forty Cents' Worth of Lunch.    They got around Jim and Quieted him, and Mr. Byrd suggested that they go  and Eat something before they got too Busy. The Country Customer would  not leave the Art Buffet until Bob had promised to come down and Visit  him sometime. When they got into the Street again the Country Customer  noticed that all the Office Buildings were set on the Bias, and they  were introducing a new style of spiral Lamp-Post.    They dined at a Palm-Garden that had Padding under the Table-Cloth and a  Hungarian Orchestra in the Corner. Mr. Byrd ordered Eleven Courses, and  then asked Jim what Kind he usually had with his Dinner. This is an  Awful Question to pop at a Man who has been on Rain Water and Buttermilk  all his Life. Jim was not to be Fazed. He said that he never ordered any  Particular Label for fear People might think he was an Agent. That was  the Best Thing that Jim said all Evening.    Mr. Byrd told the Waiter to stand behind Jim and keep Busy. When Jim  began to Make Signs that he could not Stand any more, the Entertainer  told him to Inhale it and rub it in his Hair.    [Illustration: \"HOORAY! HOORAY!\"]    Along toward Dessert Jim was talking in the Tone used by Muggsy McGraw  when he is Coaching the Man who is Playing Off from Second. He was  telling how much he Loved his Wife. She would have been Pleased to hear  it.    Mr. Byrd paid a Check that represented One Month's Board down where Jim  lived. They fell into a Horseless Hansom and went to see the Hity-Tity  Variety and Burlesque Aggregation in a new Piece entitled \"Hooray!  Hooray!\" Jim sat in a Box for the First Time, and wanted to throw Money  on the Stage. The Head Usher had to come around once in a while to ask  him not to let his Feet hang over, and to remember that the Company  could do all the Singing without any Help from him. Mr. Byrd sat back  slightly Flushed and watched the Country Customer make a Show of  himself. It was an Old Story to him. He knew that the quiet School  Trustee kind of a Man who goes Home at Sundown for 364 Days in the Year,  with the Morning Steak and a Roll of Reading Matter under his Arm, is  the worst Indian in the World when he does find himself among the Tall  Houses and gets it Up his Nose.    He allowed Jim to stand and Yell when the Chorus struck the Grand  Finale, and a little later on, when they had chartered a low-necked  Carriage and Jim wanted to get up and Drive, he Stood for it, although  he had to make a Pretty Talk to a couple of Policemen before he landed  Jim at the Hotel.    If this were a Novel, there would be a Row of Stars inserted right here.    The Sun was high in the Heavens when the Country Customer opened his  Eyes and tried to Remember and then tried to Forget. Some one was  sitting at his Bedside. It was Mr. Byrd, the Long-Distance Entertainer,  looking as Sweet and Cool as a Daisy.    \"Before I give you the Photograph of Myself which you requested last  Night, would you care for anything in the way of Ice Water?\" he asked.    Jim did a sincere Groan, and said he could use a Barrel of it.    \"Did I request a Photograph?\" he asked, as he felt for the Boundaries of  his Head.    [Illustration: JIM]    \"You did,\" replied the Entertainer. \"And you gave me your Watch as a  Keepsake. I have brought the Watch and all the Money you had left after  you bought the Dog.\"    \"What Dog?\"    \"The Dog that you gave to Bob.\"    \"Did we go back there again? I remember the First Time.\"    \"Yes, it was In There that you wanted to Run a Hundred Yards with any  Man Present for Chalk, Money, or Marbles.\"    \"Where are we now--at the Hotel?\"    \"Yes, and Everything is Smoothed Over. The Night Clerk has agreed not to  swear out a Warrant.\"    Jim did not Comprehend, but he was afraid to Ask.    \"It may be that I was a mite Polluted,\" he suggested.    \"You were a teeny bit Pickled about Two, when you tried to upset the  Lunch Wagon, but I don't think any one Noticed it,\" said Mr. Byrd.    \"Take me to the Noon Train,\" requested the Country Customer. \"Tell the  Conductor where I live, and send me the Bills for all that I have  Broken.\"    \"Everything is Settled,\" responded the Entertainer. \"But why Tear  yourself away?\"    \"I am Through,\" replied Jim, \"So why Tarry?\"    Mr. Byrd took him to the Train and arranged with the Porter of the  Parlor Car for a Pillow.    When the Country Customer arrived at Home he accounted for the Eyes by  saying that the Night Traffic makes so much Noise on these Hard Stone  Pavements, it is almost impossible to get the usual amount of Sleep.    The Head of the Concern put his O.K. on a Voucher for $43.60, and it  occurred to him that Stereopticon Lectures seemed to be Advancing, but  he asked no Questions.    Ever after that Jim bought all his Goods of this one House. He had to.

When Lutie was eighteen her Mother said they  ought to do something with Lutie's Voice. The Neighbors thought so, too.

She suspected that Lutie had a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11938"],[0,"Folklore of the Santal Parganas (#9)"],[1,"son of a Raja;  whenever you go to bathe, do not bathe at the common bathing place,  but at a place by yourself; give me my coin,\" and the Prince did  so. Then he continued, \"My third maxim is this: You are the son of a  Raja; when men come to you for advice or to have a dispute decided,  listen to what the majority of those present say and do not follow  your own fancy, now pay me;\" and the Prince gave him his last gold  coin, and said that he had no more. \"Well,\" said the ploughman, \"your  lesson is finished but still I will give you one more piece of advice  free and it is this: You are the son of a Raja; Restrain your anger,  if anything you see or hear makes you angry, still do not at once take  action; hear the explanation and weigh it well, then if you find cause  you can give rein to your anger and if not, let the offender off.\"    After this the prince set his face homewards as he had spent all  his money; and he began to repent of having spent his gold pieces  on advice that seemed worthless. However on his way he turned into  a bazar to buy some food and the shopkeepers on all sides called out  \"Buy, buy,\" so he went to a shop and the shopkeeper invited him to sit  on a rug; he was just about to do so when he remembered the maxim of  his instructor and pulled the rug to one side; and when he did so he  saw that it had been spread over the mouth of a well and that if he  had sat on it he would have been killed[1]; so he began to believe  in the wisdom of his teacher. Then he went on his way and on the  road he turned aside to a tank to bathe, and remembering the maxim  of his teacher he did not bathe at the common place but went to a  place apart; then having eaten his lunch he continued his journey,  but he had not gone far when he found that he had left his purse  behind, so he turned back and found it lying at the place where he  had put down his things when he bathed; thereupon he applauded the  wisdom of his teacher, for if he had bathed at the common bathing  place someone would have seen the purse and have taken it away. When  evening came on he turned into a village and asked the headman to let  him sleep in his verandah, and there was already one other traveller  sleeping there and in the morning it was found that the traveller had  died in his sleep. Then the headman consulted the villagers and they  decided that there was nothing to be done but to throw away the body,  and that as the Prince was also a traveller he should do it. At first  he refused to touch the corpse as he was the son of a Raja, but the  villagers insisted and then he bethought himself of the maxim that  he should not act contrary to the general opinion; so he yielded and  dragged away the body, and threw it into a ravine.    Before leaving it he remembered that it was proper to remove the  clothes, and when he began to do so he found round the waist of the  body a roll of coin; so he took this and was glad that he had followed  the advice of his teacher.    That evening he reached the boundary of his own territory and decided  to press on home although it was dark; at midnight he reached the  palace and without arousing anyone went to the door of his wife's  room. Outside the door he saw a pair of shoes and a sword; at the  sight he became wild with rage and drawing the sword he called out:  \"Who is in my room?\"    As a matter of fact the Prince's wife had got the Prince's little  sister to sleep with her, and when the girl heard the Prince's voice  she got up to leave; but when she opened the door and saw the Prince  standing with the drawn sword she drew back in fear; she told him  who she was and explained that they had put the shoes and sword at  the door to prevent anyone else from entering; but in his wrath the  Prince would not listen and called to her to come out and be killed.    Then she took off her cloth and showed it to him through the crack of  the door and at the sight of this he was convinced; then he reflected  on the advice of his teacher and repented, because he had nearly  killed his sister through not restraining his wrath.          XV. The Monkey Boy.    There was once a man who had six sons and two daughters and he died  leaving his wife pregnant of a ninth child.    And when the child was born it proved to be a monkey.    The villagers and relations advised the mother to make away with it,  but she refused saying \"Chando knows why he has given me such a child,  but as he has done so I will rear it.\"    All her relations said that if she chose to rear a monkey they would  turn her out of the family. However she persisted that she would do  so at all costs. So they sent her to live with her child in a hut  outside the village, and the monkey boy grew up and learned to talk  like a human being.    One day his elder brothers began to clear the jungle for cultivation  and the monkey boy took a hatchet and went with them; he asked where  he could clear land for himself and in fun they showed him the place  where the jungle was thickest. So he went there and drove his hatchet  into the trunk of a tree and then returned and watched his brothers  working hard clearing the scrub, and when they had finished their work  he went and fetched his hatchet and returned home with them. Every  day he did the same--and one day his brothers asked why he spent all  his time with them, but he said that he only came to them when he was  tired of cutting down trees; they laughed at this and said that they  would like to see his clearing, so he took them to the place and to  their astonishment they saw a large clearing, bigger than they had  been able to make for themselves. Then the brothers burnt the jungle  they had cut down and began to plough the land.    But the monkey boy's mother had no plough or cattle nor any seed rice;  the only thing in the house was a pumpkin, so he took the seed out  of the pumpkin and sowed it in his clearing. His brothers asked what  he had sown and he told them--Rice.    The brothers ploughed and sowed and used to go daily to watch the  growing crop, and one day they went to have a look at the monkey boy's  crop and they saw that it was pumpkins and not rice and they laughed  at him. When their crop was ripe the brothers prepared to offer the  first fruits and the monkey boy watched them that he might observe the  same ceremonies as they. One day they brought home the first fruits  and offered them to the _bongas_, and they invited the monkey boy  and his mother to come to the feast which followed the offering.    They both went and enjoyed themselves; and two or three days later  the monkey boy said that he would also have a feast of first fruits,  so he told his mother to clear the courtyard and invited his brothers  and he purified himself and went to his clearing and brought home the  biggest pumpkin that had grown there; this he offered to the spirits;  he sliced off the top of it as if it were the head of a fowl, and  as he did so he saw that the inside was full of rice; he called his  mother and they filled a winnowing fan with the rice and there was  enough besides to nearly fill a basket; they were delighted at this  windfall but kept the matter secret lest they should be robbed. The  monkey boy told his mother to be sure and cook enough rice so that  his brothers and their wives might have as much as ever they could  eat, and not merely a small helping such as they had given him,  and if necessary he would go and fetch another pumpkin; so his  mother boiled the rice. When the time fixed for the feast came,  nothing was to be seen of the brothers because they did not expect  that there would really be anything for them to eat; so the monkey  boy went and fetched them, and when they came to the feast they  were astonished to have as much rice as they could eat. When the  crop was quite ripe the monkey boy gathered all the pumpkins and  got sufficient rice from them to last for the whole year. After  this the brothers went out to buy horses, and the monkey boy went  with them and as he had no money he took nothing but a coil of rope;  his brothers were ashamed to have him with them and drove him away,  so he went on ahead and got first to the place where the horsedealer  lived. The brothers arrived late in the evening and decided to make  their purchases the following morning and ride their horses home, so  they camped for the night. The monkey boy spent the night hiding on  the rafters of the stable; and in the night the horses began to talk  to each other and discussed which could gallop farthest, and one mare  said \"I can gallop twelve _kos_ on the ground and then twelve _kos_  in the air.\" When the monkey boy heard this he got down and lamed  the mare by running a splinter into her hoof. The next morning the  brothers bought the horses which pleased them and rode off. Then the  monkey boy went to the horsedealer and asked why the mare was lame  and advised him to apply remedies. But the dealer said that that  was useless: when horses got ill they always died; then the monkey  boy asked if he would sell the mare and offered to give the coil of  rope in exchange; the dealer, thinking that the animal was useless,  agreed, so the monkey boy led it away, but when he was out of sight  he took out the splinter and the lameness at once ceased. Then he  mounted the mare and rode after his brothers, and when he had nearly  overtaken them he rose into the air and flew past his brothers and  arrived first at home. There he tied up the mare outside his house  and went and bathed and had his dinner and waited for his brothers.    They did not arrive for a full hour afterwards and when they saw  the monkey boy and his mount they wanted to know how he had got home  first. He boasted of how swift his mare was and so they arranged to  have a race and match their horses against his. The race took place  two or three days later and the monkey boy's mare easily beat all the  other horses, she"]]]
