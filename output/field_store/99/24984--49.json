The high percentage of men unfit for  military duty was not due to the Boer's unhealthfulness, for he is as  healthy as farmers are in other parts of the earth. Take the entire male  population of any district in Europe and America and compare the  individuals with the standard required by army rules, and the result will  not differ greatly from the result of the Boer examination. If all the  youths and old men, the sick and maimed, could have been eliminated from  the Boer forces, eighty per cent, would probably have been found to be a  low estimate of the number thus subtracted from the total force. It would  have been heartrending to many a continental or American general to see  the unmilitary appearance of the Boer burgher, and in what manner an army  of children, great-grandfathers, invalids, and blind men, with a handful  of good men to leaven it, could be of any service whatever would have been  quite beyond his conception. It was such a mixed force that a Russian  officer, who at the outset of the war entered the Transvaal to fight,  became disgusted with its unmilitary appearance and returned to his own  country.    The accoutrement of the Boer burgher was none the less incongruous than  the physical appearance of the majority of them, although no expensive  uniform and trappings could have been of more practical value. The men of  the Pretoria and Johannesburg commandos had the unique honor of going to  the war in uniforms specially made for the purpose, but there was no  regulation or law which compelled them to wear certain kinds of clothing.  When these commandos went to the frontier several days before the actual  warfare had begun they were clothed in khaki-coloured cloth of almost the  same description as that worn by the soldiers whom they intended to fight.  These two commandos were composed of town-folk who had absorbed many of  the customs and habits of the foreigners who were in the country, and they  felt that it would be more warlike if they should wear uniforms made  specially for camp and field. The old Boers of the towns and the takhaars  looked askance at the youth of Pretoria and Johannesburg in their  uniforms, and shook their heads at the innovation as smacking too much of  an anti-republican spirit.    Like Cincinnatus, the majority of the old Boers went directly from their  farms to the battlefields, and they wore the same clothing in the laagers  as they used when shearing their sheep or herding their cattle. When they  started for the frontier the Boer farmers arranged matters so that they  might be comfortable while the campaign continued. Many, it is true,  dashed away from home at the first call to arms and carried with them,  besides a rifle and bandolier, nothing but a mackintosh, blanket, and  haversack of food. The majority of them, however, were solicitous of their  future comfort and loaded themselves down with all kinds of luggage. Some  went to the frontier with the big, four-wheeled ox-waggons and in these  they conveyed cooking utensils, trunks, boxes with food and flour,  mattresses, and even stoves. The Rustenburg farmers were specially  solicitous about their comfort, and those patriotic old takhaars  practically moved their families and household furniture to the camps.  Some of the burghers took two or three horses each in order that there  might be no delay or annoyance in case of misfortune by death or accident,  and frequently a burgher could be seen who had one horse for himself,  another for his camp utensils and extra clothing, and a third and fourth  for native servants who cooked his meals and watched the horses while they  grazed.    Without his horse the Boer would be of little account as a fighting man,  and those magnificent little ponies deserve almost as much credit for such  success as attended the campaign as their riders. If some South African  does not frame a eulogy of the little beasts it will not be because they  do not deserve it. The horse was half the Centaur and quite the life of  him. Small and wiry, he was able to jog along fifty and sixty miles a day  for several days in succession, and when the occasion demanded it, he was  able to attain a rate of speed that equalled that of the ordinary South  African railway train which, however, makes no claims to lightning-like  velocity. He bore all kinds of weather, was not liable to sickness except  in one season of the year, and he was able to work two and even three days  without more than a blade of grass. He was able to thrive on the grass of  the veld, and when winter killed that product he needed but a few bundles  of forage a day to keep him in good condition. He climbed rocky  mountain-sides as readily as a buck, and never wandered from a path by  darkest night. He drank and apparently relished the murky water of  mud-pools and needed but little attention with the currycomb and brush.  He was trained to obey the slightest turn of the reins, and a slight  whistle brought him to a full stop. When his master left him and went  forward into battle the Boer pony remained in the exact position where he  was placed, and when perchance a shell or bullet ended his existence, then  the Boer paid a tribute to the value of his dead servant by refusing to  continue the fight and by beating a hasty retreat.    In the early part of the campaign in Natal the laagers were filled with  ox-waggons, and, in the absence of tents which were sadly wanted during  that season of heavy rains, they stood in great stead to the burghers. The  rear half of the waggons were tented with an arched roof, as all the  trek-waggons are, and under these shelters the burghers lived. Many of the  burghers who left their ox-waggons at home took small, light, four-wheeled  carriages, locally called spiders, or the huge two-wheelers or Cape-carts  so serviceable and common throughout the country. These were readily  transformed into tents, and made excellent sleeping accommodations by  night and transport-waggons for the luggage when the commandos moved from  one place to another. When a rapid march was contemplated all the heavy  waggons were left behind in charge of native servants with which every  burgher was provided.    It was quite in keeping with their other ideas of personal comfort for  many Boer burghers to carry a coloured parasol or an umbrella to protect  them from the rays of the sun, and it was not considered beneath their  dignity to wear a woman's shawl around their shoulders or head when the  morning air was chilly. At first sight of these unique spectacles the  stranger in the Boer country felt amused, but if he cared to smile at  every unmilitary scene he would have had little time for other things. It  was a republican army composed of republicans, and anything that smacked  of the opposite was abhorred. There were no flags or insignia of any kind  to lead the burghers on. What mottoes there were that expressed their  cause were embroidered on the bands of their slouch-hats and cut on the  stocks of their rifles. \"For God and Freedom,\" \"For Freedom, Land, and  People,\" and \"For God, Country, and Justice,\" were among the sentiments  which some of the burghers carried into battle on their hats and rifles.  Others had vierkleur ribbons as bands for their hats, while many carried  on the upturned brim of their hats miniatures containing the photographs  of the Presidents.    Aside from the dangers arising from a contact with the enemy and the  heart-burns resulting from a long absence from his home, the Boer  burgher's experiences at the front were not arduous. First and foremost he  had a horse and rifle, and with these he was always more or less happy. He  had fresh meat provided to him daily, and he had native servants to  prepare and serve his meals for him. He was under no discipline whatever,  and he could be his own master at all times. He generally had his sons or  brothers with him in the same laager, and to a Boer there was always much  joy in this. He could go on picket duty and have a brush with the enemy  whenever he felt inclined to do so, or he could remain in his laager and  never have a glimpse of the enemy. Every two months he was entitled to a  ten days' leave of absence to visit his home, and at other times during  the first five months of the war, his wife and children were allowed to  visit him in his laager. If he was stationed along the northern or western  frontiers of the Transvaal he was in the game country, and he was able to  go on buck-shooting expeditions as frequently as he cared. He was not  compelled to rise at a certain hour in the morning, and he could go to bed  whenever he wished. There was no drill, no roll-calls, nor any of the  thousands of petty details which the soldiers of even the Portuguese army  are compelled to perform. As a result of a special law there was no work  on Sundays or Church-holidays unless the enemy brought it about, and then,  if he was a stickler for the observance of the Sabbath, he was not  compelled to move a muscle. The Boer burgher could eat, sleep, or fight  whenever he wished, and inasmuch as he was a law unto himself, there was  no one who could compel him to change his habits. It was an ideal  idle-man's mode of living and the foreign volunteers who had leaves of  absence from their own armies made the most of their holiday, but in that  respect they did not surpass their companion, the Boer burgher.    The most conspicuous feature of the Boer forces was the equality of the  officers and the men, and the entire absence of any assumption of  superiority by the leaders of the burghers. None of the generals or  commandants wore any uniform of a distinctive type, and it was one of the  most difficult problems to distinguish an officer from the burghers. All  the officers, from the Commandant-General down to the corporal, carried "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#9)"],[1,"ny's monopoly of music  since the end of the eighteenth century, musical traditions--which had  been chiefly Italian in the two preceding centuries--now became almost  entirely German. We think in German forms: the plan of phrases, their  development, their balance, and all the rhetoric of music and the  grammar of composition comes to us from foreign thought, slowly  elaborated by German masters. That domination has never been more  complete or more heavy since Wagner's victory. Then reigned over the  world this great German period--a scaly monster with a thousand arms,  whose grasp was so extensive that it included pages, scenes, acts, and  whole dramas in its embrace. We cannot say that French writers have ever  tried to write in the style of Goethe or Schiller; but French composers  have tried and are still trying to write music after the manner of  German musicians.    Why be astonished at it? Let us face the matter plainly. In music we  have not, so to speak, any masters of French style. All our greatest  composers are foreigners. The founder of the first school of French  opera, Lulli, was Florentine; the founder of the second school, Gluck,  was German; the two founders of the third school were Rossini, an  Italian, and Meyerbeer, a German; the creators of _opera-comique_ were  Duni, an Italian, and Gretry, a Belgian; Franck, who revolutionised our  modern school of opera, was also Belgian. These men brought with them a  style peculiar to their race; or else they tried to found, as Gluck did,  an \"international\" style,[77] by which they effaced the more individual  characteristics of the French spirit. The most French of all these  styles is the _opera-comique_, the work of two foreigners, but owing  much more to the _opera-bouffe_ than is generally admitted, and, in any  case, representing France very insufficiently.    [Footnote 77: Gluck himself said this in a letter to the _Mercure de  France_, February, 1773.]    Some more rational minds have tried to rid themselves of this Italian  and German influence, but have mostly arrived at creating an  intermediate Germano-Italian style, of which the operas of Auber and  Ambroise Thomas are a type.    Before Berlioz's time there was really only one master of the first rank  who made a great effort to liberate French music: it was Rameau; and,  despite his genius, he was conquered by Italian art.[78]    By force of circumstance, therefore, French music found itself moulded  in foreign musical forms. And in the same way that Germany in the  eighteenth century tried to imitate French architecture and literature,  so France in the nineteenth century acquired the habit of speaking  German in music. As most men speak more than they think, even thought  itself became Germanised; and it was difficult then to discover, through  this traditional insincerity, the true and spontaneous form of French  musical thought.    But Berlioz's genius found it by instinct. From the first he strove to  free French music from the oppression of the foreign tradition that was  suffocating it.[79]    [Footnote 78: I am not speaking of the Franco-Flemish masters at the end  of the sixteenth century: of Jannequin, Costeley, Claude le Jeune, or  Mauduit, recently discovered by M. Henry Expert, who are possessed of so  original a flavour, and have yet remained almost entirely unknown from  their own time to ours. Religious wars bruised France's musical  traditions and denied some of the grandeur of her art.]    [Footnote 79: It is amusing to find Wagner comparing Berlioz with Auber,  as the type of a true French musician--Auber and his mixed Italian and  German opera. That shows how Wagner, like most Germans, was incapable of  grasping the real originality of French music, and how he saw only its  externals. The best way to find out the musical characteristics of a  nation is to study its folk-songs. If only someone would devote himself  to the study of French folk-song (and there is no lack of material),  people would realise perhaps how much it differs from German folk-song,  and how the temperament of the French race shows itself there as being  sweeter and freer, more vigorous and more expressive.]    He was fitted in every way for the part, even by his deficiencies and  his ignorance. His classical education in music was incomplete. M.  Saint-Saens tells us that \"the past did not exist for him; he did not  understand the old composers, as his knowledge of them was limited to  what he had read about them.\" He did not know Bach. Happy ignorance! He  was able to write oratorios like _L'Enfance du Christ_ without being  worried by memories and traditions of the German masters of oratorio.  There are men like Brahms who have been, nearly all their life, but  reflections of the past. Berlioz never sought to be anything but  himself. It was thus that he created that masterpiece, _La Fuite en  Egypte_, which sprang from his keen sympathy with the people.    He had one of the most untrammelled spirits that ever breathed. Liberty  was for him a desperate necessity. \"Liberty of heart, of mind, of  soul--of everything.... Real liberty, absolute and immense!\"[80] And  this passionate love of liberty, which was his misfortune in life, since  it deprived him of the comfort of any faith, refused him any refuge for  his thoughts, robbed him of peace, and even of the soft pillow of  scepticism--this \"real liberty\" formed the unique originality and  grandeur of his musical conceptions.    [Footnote 80: _Memoires_, I, 221.]         \"Music,\" wrote Berlioz to C. Lobe, in 1852, \"is the most poetic,       the most powerful, the most living of all arts. She ought to be the       freest, but she is not yet.... Modern music is like the classic       Andromeda, naked and divinely beautiful. She is chained to a rock       on the shores of a vast sea, and awaits the victorious Perseus who       shall loose her bonds and break in pieces the chimera called       Routine.\"    The business was to free music from its limited rhythms and from the  traditional forms and rules that enclosed it;[81] and, above all, it  needed to be free from the domination of speech, and to be released from  its humiliating bondage to poetry. Berlioz wrote to the Princess of  Wittgenstein, in 1856:--    [Footnote 81: \"Music to-day, in the vigour of her youth, is emancipated  and free and can do what she pleases. Many old rules have no longer any  vogue; they were made by unreflecting minds, or by lovers of routine for  other lovers of routine. New needs of the mind, of the heart, and of the  sense of hearing, make necessary new endeavours and, in some cases, the  breaking of ancient laws. Many forms have become too hackneyed to be  still adopted. The same thing may be entirely good or entirely bad,  according to the use one makes of it, or the reasons one has for making  use of it. Sound and sonority are secondary to thought, and thought is  secondary to feeling and passion.\" (These opinions were given with  reference to Wagner's concerts in Paris, in 1860, and are taken from _A  travers chants_, p. 312.)    Compare Beethoven's words: \"There is no rule that one may not break for  the advancement of beauty.\"]         \"I am for free music. Yes, I want music to be proudly free, to be       victorious, to be supreme. I want her to take all she can, so that       there may be no more Alps or Pyrenees for her. But she must       achieve her victories by fighting in person, and not rely upon her       lieutenants. I should like her to have, if possible, good verse       drawn up in order of battle; but, like Napoleon, she must face the       fire herself, and, like Alexander, march in the front ranks of the       phalanx. She is so powerful that in some cases she would conquer       unaided; for she has the right to say with Medea: 'I, myself, am       enough.'\"    Berlioz protested vigorously against Gluck's impious theory[82] and  Wagner's \"crime\" in making music the slave of speech. Music is the  highest poetry and knows no master.[83] It was for Berlioz, therefore,  continually to increase the power of expression in pure music.    [Footnote 82: Is it necessary to recall the _epitre dedicatoire_ of  _Alceste_ in 1769, and Gluck's declaration that he \"sought to bring  music to its true function--that of helping poetry to strengthen the  expression of the emotions and the interest of a situation ... and to  make it what fine colouring and the happy arrangement of light and shade  are to a skilful drawing\"?]    [Footnote 83: This revolutionary theory was already Mozart's: \"Music  should reign supreme and make one forget everything else.... In an opera  it is absolutely necessary that Poetry should be Music's obedient  daughter\" (Letter to his father, 13 October, 1781). Despairing probably  at being unable to obtain this obedience, Mozart thought seriously of  breaking up the form of opera, and of putting in its place, in 1778, a  sort of melodrama (of which Rousseau had given an example in 1773),  which he called \"duodrama,\" where music and poetry were loosely  associated, yet not dependent on each other, but went side by side on  two parallel roads (Letter of 12 November, 1778).]    And while Wagner, who was more moderate and a closer follower of  tradition, sought to establish a compromise (perhaps an impossible one)  between music and speech, and to create the new lyric drama, Berlioz,  who was more revolutionary, achieved the dramatic symphony, of which the  unequalled model to-day is still _Romeo et Juliette_.    The dramatic symphony naturally fell foul of all formal theories. Two  arguments were set up against it: one derived from Bayreuth, and by now  an act of faith; the other, current opinion, upheld by the crowd that  speaks of music without understanding it.    The first argument, maintained by Wagner, is that music cannot really  express action without the help of speech and gesture. It is in the name  of this opinion that so"]]]
