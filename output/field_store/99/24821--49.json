Haydn tried  every way he could think of to represent the ocean, but Kurz was not  satisfied. At last he flung his hands down with a crash on each end  of the keyboard and brought them together in the middle. \"That's it,  that's it,\" cried the manager and embraced the youth excitedly. All  went well with the rest of the opera. It was finished and produced,  but did not make much stir, a fact which was not displeasing to the  composer, as he was not proud of his first attempt.    His acquaintance with Porpora promised better things. The singing  master had noticed his skill in playing the harpsichord, and offered  to engage him as accompanist. Haydn gladly accepted at once, hoping to  pick up much musical knowledge in this way. Old Porpora was very  harsh and domineering at first, treating him more like a valet than  a musician. But at last he was won over by Haydn's gentleness and  patience, until he was willing to answer all his questions and  to correct his compositions. Best of all he brought Haydn to the  attention of the nobleman in whose house he was teaching, so that  when the nobleman and his family went to the baths of Mannersdorf for  several months, Haydn was asked to go along as accompanist to Porpora.    The distinguished musicians he met at Mannersdorf were all very kind  to him and showed much interest in his compositions, many of which  were performed during this visit. The nobleman, impressed with Haydn's  desire to succeed, allotted him a pension of a sum equal to fifteen  dollars a month. The young musician's first act on receiving this was  to buy himself a neat suit of black.    Good fortune followed him on his return to Vienna. More pupils came,  until he was able to raise his prices and move into better lodgings.  A wealthy patron of music, the Countess of Thun, sent for him to come  and see her. She had heard one of his clavier sonatas played, found  it charming and wished to see the composer. Her manner was so  sympathetic, that Haydn was led to tell her the story of his  struggles. Tears came into her eyes as she listened. She promised her  support as friend and pupil, and Haydn left her with a happy, grateful  heart.    His compositions were heard in the best musical circles in Vienna, and  the future was bright with promise. A wealthy music patron persuaded  him to write a string quartet, the first of many to follow. Through  this man he received, in 1759, an appointment of music director to a  rich Bohemian, Count Morzin, who had a small orchestra at his country  seat. In the same year the first Symphony was composed.    As brighter days dawned, Haydn procured all the works on theory  obtainable, and studied them deeply. He had mastered the difficulties  of the \"Gradus,\" one of the books purchased years before, and without  any outside help had worked out his musical independence, uninfluenced  by any other musician. He was now twenty-six, and his fame was  growing. Meanwhile an affair of the heart had great influence on his  life. Sometime previously Haydn had been engaged to give lessons  on the harpsichord to two daughters of a wig-maker named Keller. An  attachment soon sprang up between the teacher and the younger of the  girls. His poverty had stood in the way of making his feelings known.  But as prosperity began to dawn, he grew courageous and asked the  maiden to become his wife. His disappointment was keen when he found  the girl had in the meantime decided to take the veil. The wig-maker  proved to be a matchmaker, for when he learned how matters stood he  urged the composer to take the sister, who was only three years older.  The gentle Haydn was unable to withstand the pressure brought to bear,  and consented. After his bride was his he found he had won a virago,  one who cared nothing for art or for her husband's ideals, if only she  could have enough money to spend.    The composer was in sad straits for a while, but fortunately a way  opened by means of which he could be free. Count Morzin, where he had  conducted the orchestra, was obliged to reduce his establishment and  dismissed his band and its director. As soon as this was known, the  reigning Prince of Hungary, Paul Anton Esterhazy offered Haydn the  post of assistant Capellmeister at his country seat of Eisenstadt.  The head Capellmeister, Werner, was old, but the Prince kept him  on account of his long service. Haydn, however, was to have  entire control of the orchestra, and also of most of the musical  arrangements.    Haydn was blissfully happy over the realization of his highest hopes.  In his wildest dreams he had never imagined such magnificence as he  found at the palace of Eisenstadt. The great buildings, troops of  servants, the wonderful parks and gardens, with their flowers, lakes  and fountains almost made him believe he was in fairyland. Of course  there would be some hard work, though it would not seem hard amid such  fascinating surroundings and there would be plenty of leisure for his  own creative activities. Best of all his wife could not be with him.    Prince Paul Anton passed away after a year and his brother Nikolaus  succeeded him. He advanced Haydn still further, and increased his  salary. Werner, the old Capellmeister, died in 1766, and Haydn  succeeded to the full title. This was the father's dream for his boy  Josef, and it had been abundantly realized. His mother had passed  away, but his father was living, and had come, on one occasion,  to Eisenstadt to see him. His brother Michael who had now become  Concertmeister in Salzburg, spent several happy days with him also.    The summer residence of Prince Nikolaus at Esterhazy had been rebuilt,  enlarged and was more magnificent than Eisenstadt. The music was more  elaborate. The Prince was so fond of the life there that he postponed  his return to town till late in the autumn.    In order to give him a hint through music, Haydn composed what he  called the \"Farewell Symphony,\" in which, toward the close each pair  of players in turn rose, extinguished their candles and passed out,  until only the first violinist remained. He last of all blew out his  light and left, while Haydn prepared to follow. The Prince at last  understood, and treating the whole as a joke, gave orders for the  departure of the household.    In 1790 Haydn lost the master to whom he was so devotedly attached.  He received a pension of a thousand florins on condition that he would  retain his post. But Prince Anton, who succeeded his brother, cared  nothing for music; Haydn was not obliged to live at the palace and  returned to Vienna. Several attempts had already been made to induce  him to visit London, but he always had refused. Now there seemed to be  no obstacle in the way. One day a visitor called. \"My name is Salomon;  I have come from London to fetch you; we will settle terms to-morrow.\"  On the sail from Calais to Dover, the composer first saw the sea and  was reminded of his boyish efforts to describe it in tones.    London welcomed Haydn warmly, for his fame had preceded him and his  music was familiar. The first concert was given March 11, 1790 at the  Hanover Square Rooms, and was a great success. This was followed by a  series of concerts, and at last a benefit for the composer on May 16,  which was an ovation and realized three hundred and fifty pounds. He  heard the \"Messiah\" for the first time and when, at the \"Hallelujah  Chorus,\" the audience sprang to its feet, he burst into tears,  exclaiming \"He is the master of us all!\"    At Oxford, in July, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of  Music, and three great concerts were given in his honor, with special  performers brought from London. In fact the whole visit to England had  been such a success that he repeated the trip in 1794, and received  even greater honors. His symphonies were heard on all London  programs. He was the lion of the season, and was frequently invited to  Buckingham Palace to play for the King and Queen, who always urged  him to live in England. Haydn was now sixty-five; he had composed  quantities of music, but his greatest work, \"The Creation,\" was not  yet written. While in London, Salomon had shown him a poem founded on  \"Paradise Lost,\" written years before in the hope that Handel would  use it for an oratorio. Haydn decided to try his hand at oratorio on  this subject. As he went on, it grew to be a labor of love and prayer.  It was finished and performed in Vienna, March 19, 1799, and made  a profound impression. The composer at once began work on a second  oratorio, founded on Thompson's \"Seasons.\" The desire for work was  strong within, but his health was failing. \"'The Seasons' gave me my  finishing stroke,\" he often remarked to friends.    Haydn was acknowledged on every hand as the father of instrumental  music. He laid great stress on melody. \"It is the air which is  the charm of music,\" he said, \"and it is the air which is the most  difficult to produce. The invention of a fine melody is a work of  genius.\"    Full of years and honors, respected and beloved, Father Haydn passed  away. As Vienna was at that time in the hands of the French, he was  given a very simple burial. In 1820 Prince Esterhazy had the remains  reinterred in the upper parish church at Eisenstadt, where a simple  stone with Latin inscription is placed in the wall above the vault to  mark the spot.          VI    WOLFGANG MOZART      The early December dusk was closing in over the quaint old city of  Salzburg. Up on the heights above the town the battlements of the  great castle caught a reflection of the last gleams of light in the  sky. But the narrow streets below were quite in shadow.    In one of the substantial looking houses on a principal thoroughfare,  called the Getreide Gasse, lights gleamed from windows on the third  floor. Within, all was arranged as if for some special occasion.  The larger room,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#9)"],[1,"try to'; (iv) earnest expectation. This is an important and an  infallible method in Will-development.    Exercise 13.    Go by yourself into a room where you will not be disturbed. At the  beginning 'relax' all over. Then count from one to ten without allowing  any other thoughts. As soon as you accomplish this, your mind is in  a receptive state. Concentrate as before and order your sub-conscious  self to evolve a strong, infallible memory. Form your own  auto-suggestions.    Exercise 14.    Pick out half a dozen unfamiliar faces. Vividly impress them upon  your subjective mind. Then recall them at least once each day for full  one year, each day impressing at least one more new face. Should you  find you are forgetting any of your older faces, do not add new ones but  firmly fix the other old faces in your mind through concentration. This  is a very interesting exercise. Memory belongs to the sub-conscious  mind, remember.    Exercise 15.    Concentrate the mind on a paragraph in some holy book and commit  to memory. Learn by heart one paragraph daily taking care not to  forget the old ones. In time, you will improve wonderfully.    Exercise 16.    People with weak memories always lack concentrative ability.  Concentration is the key to all mind-power. You will find the above  exercises quite 'tedious' and monotonous. But you can train your  'attention' only by giving it trivial and 'dry' exercises. The strong  will can cope with the most 'monotonous' and uninteresting tasks without  experiencing fatigue. You must set yourself such tasks as might seem like  'work' to your attention. Remember, the effort required to concentrate  attention voluntarily on uninteresting, dry and monotonous works  strengthens and develops Will-Power and gives you 'mental muscle.' You  will thereby acquire firm control over mind and body and be 'Master' over  your lower impulses. Power over self will express outwardly as power over  others. If you can control yourself, you will find no difficulty in  impressing your will on others. But, mark you, this sacred power should  be used only to elevate, stimulate and strengthen others. Try your Will  upon your personality in all possible ways and be satisfied with nothing  short of perfect control. The absolute mastery of 'self' ought to be  your aim. I have given you the real secrets. You must exercise  your own ingenuity and intelligence in utilising them towards your  Self-development. I leave you to finish the fight for yourself. Get up  and start in to work at your task from to-day and not to-morrow. Back of  all efforts, always have this positive incentive and auto-suggestion:    \"THIS IS TO DEVELOP MY WILL-POWER AND NO TEMPORARY PAIN CAN EQUAL THE  POWER AND HAPPINESS ARISING OUT OF SELF-CONTROL.\"    Get firm control over your emotions. Use this natural force but be  not used by it. Control over speech will lead to Emotion-control. Always  talk to the point. Cultivate silence. Repress volubility. Be brief  in speech and writing. Keep a cool head. Be level-headed and  concentrative.      GLEANINGS FROM PROFESSOR JAMES ON THE LAW OF HABIT.    An acquired habit, from the physiological point of view, is nothing  but a new pathway of discharge formed in the brain, by which certain  incoming currents ever often tend to escape.    The great thing is to make our nervous system our ally instead of  our enemy.--Guard against ways that are likely to be disadvantageous  to us, as we should guard against the plague.    The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the  effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind  will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable  human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision and  for whom (every act) the time of rising and going to bed, the beginning  of every bit of work, are subjects for express volitional deliberation.    Maxim I. In the acquisition of a new thought or the leaving off of  an old one we must take care to launch ourselves with as strong and  decided initiative as possible.    Maxim II. Never suffer an exception to occur until the new habit  is securely rooted in your life.    Each lapse is like letting fall a ball of string which one is carefully  winding up; a single slip means more than a great many turns will wind  again.    Continuity of training is the great means of making the nervous  system act infallibly right. It is necessary above all things never to  lose a battle. Every gain on the wrong side undoes the effect of many  conquests on the right.    The essential precaution is to so regulate the opposing powers that  the one may have a series of uninterrupted success, until repetition has  fortified it to such a degree as to enable it to cope with the opposition  under any circumstances.    The need of securing success at the outset is imperative. To be  habitually successful is the thing.    Be careful not to give the will such a task as to insure its defeat  at the outset, but provided one can stand it, a sharp period of  suffering, and then a free time is the best to aim at, whether in giving  up the opium habit or in simply changing one's hours of rising or of  work.    It is surprising how soon a desire will die of inanition if it be never  fed.    Without unbroken advance there is no such thing as accumulation  of the ethical forces possible, and to make this possible and to exercise  and habituate us in it is the sovereign blessing of regular work.  Maxim III. Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every  resolution you make and on every emotional prompting you may experience  in the direction of habits you aspire to gain.    It is not the moment of their forming but in the moment of their  producing motor effects, that resolves and aspirations communicate the  new 'set' to the brain.    The actual presence of the practical opportunity alone furnishes the  fulcrum upon which the lever can rest, by means of which the moral  will may multiply its strength and raise itself aloft. He who had no  solid ground to press against will never get beyond the stage of empty  gesture making.    When a resolve or a fine glow of feeling is allowed to evaporate  without bearing practical fruit, it is a waste and a chance lost; it  works so as positively to hinder future resolutions and emotions from  taking the normal path of discharge.    If we let our emotions evaporate, they get in a way of evaporating.      WORSHIP OF THE TERRIBLE.    The attitude of the soul which is not to be baffled by the lower nature  or the \"Personal Self\" should be to seek Death and not life, to hurl  oneself upon the sword's point and become one with the terrible. Those  who are commissioned by the Lord to bear aloft the torch of spirit are  fated to see every joy of the senses turn to ashes and crushing blows  upon their eyes to the unsubstantially of the relative life of Maya.    The lion when stricken to the heart gives out his loudest roar,  When smitten on the head the cobra lifts its hood  And the majesty of the Soul comes out only when a man is wounded to his  depths.    The Western ideal is to be doing: the Eastern to be suffering. The  perfect life would be a harmony between (selfless or non-attached) doing  and suffering. Worship the terrible. Worship Death, for its own sake;  despair for its own sake; pain for its own sake. Yet this is not the  coward's or the suicide's or the weakling's morbid love of Death, but it  is the cry of the philosopher who has sounded everything to its depths  and knows intensely the vanity of the desire for happiness on the  relative plane of limitations. Remember the triumphant cry of St. Francis  of Assisi: \"WELCOME, SISTER DEATH!\" \"Be witness\"--of all that goes on but  be not entangled. Reserve to yourself the power to remain unattached at  all times. Accept nothing however pleasant, if it conceals a fetter into  thy Soul. At a word stand ready to sever any connection that gives a hint  of soul-bondage. Keep thy mind clear. Keep thy will pure. Attain the  Impersonal Standpoint, O you man! there alone canst thou quench thy  thirst for happiness never on the plane of personal. Who and what dies  and is reborn?--Your lower self, your personality.    \"Sometimes naked, sometimes mad,  Now as a scholar, again as a fool  Here a rebel, there a saint,  Thus they appear on the earth  --the Perfect Ones. Paramhamsas\"--Viveka Chudamani.    If you accept the report of the senses as final, you will say \"soul  for nature\"--but if you can gain the spiritual point of view, you will  say \"no-nature for soul.\" Evolution, devolution and involution are all  in nature and will go on cyclically and eternally. All this is merely due  to the wish of the soul to manifest itself. But such expression can come  only when the soul lives on its plane. Say \"Money is my slave, not I.\"  Say \"Nature is my slave, not I\". Give up life, give up body, give up all  desire for enjoyment on the relative plane. So shall you transcend all  limitation. Your real nature is Infinite and Absolute. Only when you  lower your nature by limiting it to the \"particular self,\" do you become  bound and unhappy. On the relative plane, you are a slave to the pair  of opposites--life and death, pleasure and pain, and so on. Here is  limitation. Here you are a slave to competition, and \"Survival of the  Fittest\" is the law. Be not blinded by the flashing light of the glare  of modern civilization. Every morsel you eat is ground out of your  brother's blood. Slave to a breath of air, slave to food, slave to  life, slave to Death, slave to a word of praise, slave to a word of  blame--\"Slave--Slave--Slave\"--that is your condition. The Soul cannot  stoop to any compromise. It refuses to conquer nature by obedience. It  will conquer nature by renouncing the body and by knowing itself. Find  thyself bodiless. Power felt within is soul; without, nature. \"We must  crush Law (nature) and"]]]
