What was in dispute in the argument in this connection was principally  whether the order is so linked with the challenged findings in the  Report that if those findings are invalid for excess of jurisdiction or  breach of natural justice the order will fall with them. There was a  subsidiary argument about whether the order was in any event invalid  because the amount may greatly exceed the maximum allowed by the long  out-of-date but still apparently extant scale prescribed in 1903 (1904  Gazette 491). We propose to consider the main argument, however, and in  doing so to confine attention to whether there is a sufficient link  between the order and the main findings complained of in the Report,  those in paragraph 377.    At the beginning of his reasons for ordering costs the Commissioner  expressed the opinion that the power should be exercised whenever the  conduct of a party at the hearing has materially and unnecessarily  extended the duration of the hearing. His following reasons include  criticisms of the management of the airline for prolonging the hearing,  and it was contended before us by Mr Baragwanath that they go no  further. We are unable to accept that contention. In reciting the  circumstances leading to the orders for costs the Commissioner expressly  includes the chief executive's order for documents to be destroyed and  says, \"The cards were produced reluctantly, and at long intervals, and I  have little doubt that there are one or two which still lie hidden in  the pack\". We think that such language would naturally be understood by  a reasonable reader to refer back to the matters more fully developed in  the section of the Report headed \"The stance adopted by the airline  before the Commission of Inquiry\", a section culminating in paragraph  377 with its references to \"a pre-determined plan of deception ... an  attempt to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders ... an  orchestrated litany of lies\". The impression almost inevitably created  is that, to adapt words used by Williams J. delivering the judgment of  this Court in _Cock_ v. _Attorney-General_ (1909) 28 N.Z.L.R. 405, 421,  the judgment for costs was in fact, though not in name, a punishment.  The reasons given for the costs orders have definite echoes of  paragraph 377 and the immediately preceding paragraphs. The airline was  being required to pay costs, and not for delaying tactics simply. A  significant part of the reasons was that in the view of the Commissioner  its chief witnesses had been organized to conceal the truth.    It is true that, on purely verbal grounds, refined distinctions can be  drawn between the sections of the Report dealing with the airline's  stance at the inquiry and with costs; but we have no doubt that their  overall effect is that most readers would understand them as closely  associated. It follows, we think, that if the findings in paragraph 377  are invalid for excess of jurisdiction or breach of natural justice they  should be seen as playing a material part in the order for $150,000  costs and as requiring the Court to set aside that order. Irrespective  of the order for costs, we think that there are strong arguments to  support the view that there is jurisdiction to review the findings in  challenged paragraphs on grounds relating to jurisdiction and natural  justice. There is a good deal of support in the authorities for  excluding or strictly limiting judicial review of Commission findings  and Mr Baragwanath carefully put the arguments forward. But, as we say,  there are reasons why the Court ought not to adopt the facile approach  of saying that the function of the Commission was merely to inquire and  report and that as the Commission's findings bind no-one they can be  disregarded entirely as having no legal effect.      Scope of Royal Commission    As has been the practice in New Zealand when a Commission of Inquiry  consists only of or is chaired by a High Court Judge, the Erebus  Commission was a Royal Commission in that the warrant was expressed to  be issued under the authority of the Letters Patent of 1917 constituting  the office of Governor-General. One of the powers delegated by the  Letters Patent to the Governor-General is to \"constitute and appoint, in  Our name and on Our behalf, all such ... Commissioners ... as may be  lawfully constituted or appointed by Us\". The warrant was also expressed  to be issued under the authority of and subject to the provisions of the  Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908, and s. 15 of that Act extends and  applies not only to inquiries under statutory Commissions appointed by  the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council but also to  inquiries under the Letters Patent. This means inter alia that  statutory-powers of summoning witnesses and requiring the production of  documents apply, that a Judge of the High Court acting as Commissioner  has the ordinary judicial immunity, and that interested persons have  statutory rights to be heard under s. 4A, inserted by an amendment made  in 1980 shortly before the inquiry now in question began. Section 2 of  the 1908 Act empowers the Governor-General by Order-in-Council to  appoint any person to be a Commission to inquire into and report upon  any question arising out of or concerning a range of matters. The  relevant one is \"(e) Any disaster or accident (whether due to natural  causes or otherwise) in which members of the public were killed or  injured ...\" In giving statutory power to appoint Commissions and  listing permissible subjects the Act differs from the Evidence Acts  considered in Australian cases. The Australian Acts presuppose the  existence of Commissions appointed under prerogative or inherent  executive powers and merely confer ancillary powers of compelling  evidence and the like. Under Acts of that type the validity of the  Commission depends on the common law and the division of powers in the  Australian Constitution. Under the New Zealand Act a Commission can be  given a statutory source for its basic authority even if it is a Royal  Commission and has a prerogative source as well.    The Erebus Commission was appointed to inquire into the causes and  circumstances of the crash. Among the particular questions referred to  it was:         (g) Whether the crash of the aircraft or the death of the       passengers and crew was caused or contributed to by any person       (whether or not that person was on board the aircraft) by an act or       omission in respect of any function in relation to the operation,       maintenance, servicing, flying, navigation, manoeuvring, or air       traffic control of the aircraft, being a function which that person       had a duty to perform or which good aviation practice required that       person to perform?    All the terms of reference fall well within s. 2 (e). The Commission was  not appointed to inquire into allegations of crime so we are not now  called upon to go into the question whether a Royal Commission can be  appointed for such a purpose, on which New Zealand and Australian  authorities diverge (see _In re The Royal Commission on Licensing_  (1945) N.Z.L.R. 665, 679; and D.R. Mummery \"Due Process and  Inquisitions\", 97 L.Q.R. 287). Nevertheless paragraph 377 of the Royal  Commission Report contains findings of organized perjury. The judgment  in the leading New Zealand case, _Cock_ v. _Attorney-General_, while  denying that the prerogative can authorize a Commission with the main  object of inquiring into alleged crimes, recognizes at p. 425 that a  Commissioner may investigate an alleged crime if to do so would be  \"merely incidental to a legitimate inquiry and necessary for the purpose  of that inquiry\". We think that the test must be what is reasonably  incidental to valid terms of reference. In relation to paragraph 377 the  allegation of excess of jurisdiction turns accordingly on whether the  findings are reasonably incidental to an inquiry into the causes and  circumstances of the crash.    It is difficult to find reasons why the Court should refuse to entertain  that question. While Commissions of mere inquiry and report are largely  free from judicial control, there is strong authority indicating that  the Courts have at least a duty to see that they keep within their terms  of reference. We agree with the opinion of Myers C.J. in the _Royal  Commission on Licensing_ case at p. 680 that it is implicit in all the  judgments in the Privy Council and the High Court in _Attorney-General  for the Commonwealth of Australia_ v. _Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd_  (1914) A.C. 237, 15 C.L.R. 182, that if it can be said in advance that  proposed questions are clearly outside the scope of the inquiry they are  irrelevant and cannot be permitted. In the _Royal Commission on  Licensing_ case that very principle was applied in this Court, it being  held that certain matters were not within the ambit of the Commission's  inquiry. That decision was given on a case stated by the Royal  Commission under ss. 10 and 13 of the 1908 Act, but the _Sugar Company_  case was an action for declaration and injunctions and the procedure was  expressly approved in the judgment of their Lordships delivered by  Viscount Haldane L.C. ((1914) A.C. at 249-50). Similarly in _McGuinness_  v. _Attorney-General_ (1940) 63 C.L.R. 73 the High Court, on an appeal  from a conviction for refusing to answer a question touching the subject  matter of an inquiry by a Commissioner, accepted without any apparent  difficulty that the Court had authority to determine whether the  question was relevant.    We do not overlook that the cases just cited were concerned with the  scope of questions that might be put to witnesses under compulsory  powers given by statute. They were not directly concerned with the scope  of findings in reports."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#9)"],[1,"      RENSBURG.      Scarcely had I returned from posting my last letter when the camp was in a  commotion, caused by the news that the West Australians were in action at  Slingersfontein, distant about twelve miles from Rensburg. To saddle up and  get out as fast as horseflesh would carry a man was but the work of a very  short period of time, for the gallop across the open veldt was not a very  laborious undertaking. I soon found that the stalwart sons of the great  gold colony were in it, and enjoying it.    Slingersfontein is an important position on the right flank of French's  column. It is not only an important but a very hard position to hold on  account of the nature of the country. Here there is but very little open  veldt; mile after mile is covered by small kopjes that rise in countless  numbers, until the whole country looks as if it were covered with a  veritable forest of hills. Once inside that labyrinth of rocky  excrescences, an army might easily be lost, unless every individual man and  officer knew the place thoroughly. The Boers know the lay of the land, and,  consequently, shift from post to post by paths that are unknown to anyone  else with marvellous dexterity and incredible swiftness. Our forces hold a  small plain, which is like the palm of a giant's hand, with the surrounding  kopjes representing the digits. We hold those kopjes also. The shape of the  camp is in the form of a horseshoe, all around the little basin great hills  rise, and from those hills England's watch-dogs keep a sharp look-out on  the movements of the foe; and well they need to, for, in ground which suits  him, the African farmer is as 'cute and cunning as a Red Indian. Behind our  position, or, rather, outside of it, there is another small tract of open  country, but beyond that, lapping around our stronghold like a crescent, is  rough, hilly ground. None of those hills is worth dignifying with the title  of mountain, but all of them are big enough to shelter a hundred or two of  the enemy, and it is there that they play their game of hide and seek,  which is so trying to the nerves of young troops. The Boers hold that rough  country entirely, and the outer edge of their semi-circle is not, at any  given point, more than four miles from our centre at Slingersfontein.    The outer line of kopjes which skirt their stalking ground are bigger than  the hills on the inner side, so that they have an excellent opportunity to  conceal their movements from the observation of our most astute pickets,  and the only way in which our commanding officer can locate the enemy with  any degree of certainty is by making a reconnaissance in force, and, if  possible, drawing their fire. If the Boers fall into this trap they  invariably pay dearly for the slight advantage they gain over the  investigating force, for our guns soon make any known position untenable.  The Boer leaders know this, however, and are very loth to allow temptation  to overcome discretion; but at times, either through the impetuosity of  their troops or through errors in generalship, they give themselves away  entirely, and that is precisely what they did upon this occasion.    By means only known to those high up in authority, our people had become  acquainted with the fact that the enemy intended to try to extend their  line on our right flank, and so threaten us not only upon the left flank,  the direct front, and right flank, but also in the rear. Could they succeed  in doing this they would have us in a peculiarly tight place, as, once  posted in force well down on our right flank, they would then at least be  able to harass us badly in our communications with Rensburg, which is our  main base of operations. It is there that the General has his headquarters;  it is from there that we keep in touch, per medium of the railway and  telegraph lines, with the rest of the British Army in South Africa. It is  from there that we draw all our supplies of fodder and ammunition. It is  from there we should draw all our additional force if we needed  reinforcements in case of a general assault by the enemy upon our position  at Slingersfontein, and it is from there that we should be strengthened  should we decide to make a forward move on the Boers' position. Therefore  it behoved us to keep that line of communication intact, no matter what the  cost. All these things were as well known to the Boer leader as to us, and  that is why they were as keen to get the position as we were, and why we  are keen to stop them from accomplishing their object.    It was for the purpose of ascertaining just what the enemy intended to do,  and how many men they had to do it with, that Major Ethoran ordered out the  West Australian Mounted Infantry, consisting of about 75 men, under Captain  Moor, an Imperial soldier in the pay of the West Australian Government, and  a small body of Inniskilling Dragoons and Lancers, with a section of the  Royal Horse Artillery and two guns. The men moved out of Slingersfontein on  Tuesday about midday, and at once proceeded towards a farmhouse located  right under the very jowl of an ugly-looking kopje.    This farm was known as Pottsberg, and was well known as a regular haunt of  the most daring and dangerous rebels in the whole district. The farm  consisted of the usual white stone farmhouse of five or six rooms, a small  orchard, surrounded by rough stone walls from three feet six to four feet  in height, and about two feet thick, a small cluster of native huts, and a  kraal for cattle, made of rough, heavy stones, topped by cakes of sun-baked  manure, stored by the farmers for fuel. Some little distance from the back  of the farmhouse a stout stone wall ran down from the kopjes on to the  plain. This wall was between four and five feet in height and half a yard  across in its weakest place--an ugly barricade in itself--behind which a  few resolute men with quick-firing rifles, which they know how to use,  could make a good stand against vastly superior numbers advancing upon them  from the open veldt.    When our fellows trotted out from camp, Captain Moor received orders to  distribute his men in small bodies all along the edge of the kopjes between  Pottsberg farmhouse and Kruger's Hill, a small kopje lying almost in a line  with our camp, on the right. The men were ordered to go as close as  possible to the enemy's position, to see as much as they could possibly see  in regard to the numbers of troops in the hills held by the enemy. If they  succeeded in discovering the rebels in large bodies they were to draw their  fire and immediately retreat at full speed. In the meantime the two guns  belonging to the Royal Horse Artillery were beautifully placed in a dip in  the veldt, where they could play upon the Boers should they attempt to rush  the West Australians at any given point. The Lancers and Dragoons were  placed in charge of some kopjes behind the guns, in order to protect them  should a concerted onslaught be made upon them by the mounted Boers, who  were shrewdly suspected to be in hiding in strong force behind the first  row of hills, which screened the enemy's position.    The Australians rode out steadily, and took up their positions with an  amount of coolness that startled older soldiers. This was absolutely their  first trial on real fighting service, and everybody connected with them was  anxious to see how they would comport themselves in the face of the enemy.  Not only was it their first fighting effort, but it was their debut in the  saddle, as until a week previous they had been simply infantrymen, and not  a dozen of them had ever been in the hands of a mounted drill instructor.  It was a big task to set such green men, but they proved before the day was  out that they were worthy of the confidence reposed in them. Captain Moor,  Lieutenant Darling, and Lieutenant Parker each took a small section into  action; the others were under the immediate control of their sergeants.  They split up into small parties, and swept the very edge of the kopjes,  peering into gullies, climbing the outer hills, working along the ravines  with a courage and thoroughness that would have done credit to the oldest  scouts in all the Empire. Yet nothing came of their investigations for  quite a long time. The enemy did not mean to be drawn, and remained  passive, so that the West Australians at last became a little bit reckless,  and were consequently not so guarded as they might have been. All at once a  body of scouts ran upon a large body of the enemy near Pottsberg Farm, in a  deep and shady ravine. The enemy were trying to evade notice, but that was  now impossible. In a moment rifles were ringing on the air, and after that  first volley the little band of Australians wheeled and galloped for the  open country. To have remained there would have meant certain death to  every one of the half-dozen who comprised the picket, so they did their  duty--they fired and rode for the veldt. In a few seconds Boers were  dashing out of the kopjes on all sides, trying to cut the small band of  Australians off or shoot them down. But the Australians knew their game;  they opened out, so that each man was practically riding alone.    The Boers could do little with them. Those who stood by the guns noticed  that very large numbers of men in the Boer ranks were either niggers or  half-castes, and it was also very noticeable that they knew but little  about the use of the rifle. They fired high and wide, and notwithstanding  the fact that they poured their ammunition away in wholesale fashion, they  did little harm worth mentioning, although many of them fired at little  more than pistol range. They were simply crazed with excitement, and did  not succeed in cutting off a single member of that adventurous band.  Whenever an Australian found himself in a tight place he simply dug his  spurs into his horse's flanks, lifted his rifle, and blazed into the"]]]
