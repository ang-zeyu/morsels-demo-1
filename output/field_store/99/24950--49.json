Like many mothers of girls, she wanted a rich  marriage for her daughter. Manifestly now she had money. But had  happiness come with prosperity?    Then Mrs. Wrapp came down. Rising, he turned to see a large woman,  elaborately gowned. She had a heavy, rather good-natured face on which  was a smile of greeting.    \"Daren Lane!\" she exclaimed, with fervor, and to his surprise, she  kissed him. There was no doubt of her pleasure. Lane's thin armor  melted. He had not anticipated such welcome. \"Oh, I'm glad to see you,  soldier boy. But you're a man now. Daren, you're white and thin.  Handsomer, though!... Sit down and talk to me a little.\"    Her kindness made his task easy.    \"I've called to pay my respects to you--and to see Helen,\" he said.    \"Of course. But talk to me first,\" she returned, with a smile. \"You'll  find me better company than that crowd upstairs. Tell me about  yourself.... Oh, I know soldiers hate to talk about themselves and the  war. Never mind the war. Are you well? Did you get hurt? You look  so--so frail, Daren.\"    There was something simple and motherly about her, that became her,  and warmed Lane's cold heart. He remembered that she had always  preferred boys to girls, and regretted she had not been the mother of  boys. So Lane talked to her, glad to find that the most ordinary news  of the service and his comrades interested her very much. The instant  she espied his _Croix de Guerre_ he seemed lifted higher in her  estimation. Yet she had the delicacy not to question him about that.  In fact, after ten minutes with her, Lane had to reproach himself for  the hostility with which he had come. At length she rose with evident  reluctance.    \"You want to see Helen. Shall I send her down here or will you go up  to her studio?\"    \"I think I'd like to go up,\" replied Lane.    \"If I were you, I would,\" advised Mrs. Wrapp. \"I'd like your  opinion--of, well, what you'll see. Since you left home, Daren, we've  been turned topsy-turvy. I'm old-fashioned. I can't get used to these  goings-on. These young people 'get my goat,' as Helen expresses it.\"    \"I'm hopelessly behind the times, I've seen that already,\" rejoined  Lane.    \"Daren, I respect you for it. There was a time when I objected to your  courting Helen. But I couldn't see into the future. I'm sorry now she  broke her engagement to you.\"    \"I--thank you, Mrs. Wrapp,\" said Lane, with agitation. \"But of course  Helen was right. She was too young.... And even if she had been--been  true to me--I would have freed her upon my return.\"    \"Indeed. And why, Daren?\"    \"Because I'll never be well again,\" he replied sadly.    \"Boy, don't say that!\" she appealed, with a hand going to his  shoulder.    In the poignancy of the moment Lane lost his reserve and told her the  truth of his condition, even going so far as to place her hand so she  felt the great bayonet hole in his back. Her silence then was more  expressive than any speech. She had the look of a woman in whom  conscience was a reality. And Lane divined that she felt she and her  daughter, and all other women of this distraught land, owed him and  his comrades a debt which could never be paid. For once she expressed  dignity and sweetness and genuine sorrow.    \"You shock me, Daren. But words are useless. I hope and pray you're  wrong. But right or wrong--you're a real American--like our splendid  forefathers. Thank God _that_ spirit still survives. It is our only  hope.\"    Lane crossed to the window and looked out, slowly conscious of  resurging self-control. It was well that he had met Mrs. Wrapp first,  for she gave him what he needed. His bleeding vanity, his pride  trampled in the dirt, his betrayed faith, his unquenchable spirit of  hope for some far-future good--these were not secrets he could hide  from every one.    \"Daren,\" said Mrs. Wrapp, as he again turned to her, \"if I were in my  daughter's place I'd beg you to take me back. And if you would, I'd  never leave your side for an hour until you were well or--or gone....  But girls now are possessed of some infernal frenzy.... God only knows  how _far_ they go, but I'm one mother who is no fool. I see little  sign of real love in Helen or any of her friends.... And the men who  lounge around after her! Walk upstairs--back to the end of the long  hall--open the door and go in. You'll find Helen and some of her  associates. You'll find the men, young, sleek, soft, well-fed--without  any of the scars or ravages of war. They didn't go to war!... They  _live_ for their bodies. And I hate these slackers. So does Helen's  father. And for three years our house has been a rendezvous for them.  We've prospered, but _that_ has been bitter fruit.\"    Strong elemental passions Lane had seen and felt in people during the  short twenty-four hours since his return home. All of them had stung  and astounded him, flung into his face the hard brutal facts of the  materialism of the present. Surely it was an abnormal condition. And  yet from the last quarter where he might have expected to find uplift,  and the crystallizing of his attitude toward the world, and the  sharpening of his intelligence--from the hard, grim mother of the girl  who had jilted him, these had come. It was in keeping with all the  other mystery.    \"On second thought, I'll go up with you,\" continued Mrs. Wrapp, as he  moved in the direction she had indicated. \"Come.\"    The wide hall, the winding stairway with its soft carpet, the narrower  hallway above--these made a long journey for Lane. But at the end,  when Mrs. Wrapp stopped with hand on the farthest door, Lane felt knit  like cold steel.    The discordant music and the soft shuffling of feet ceased. Laughter  and murmur of voices began.    \"Come, Daren,\" whispered Mrs. Wrapp, as if thrilled. Certainly her  eyes gleamed. Then quickly she threw the door open wide and called  out:    \"Helen, here's Daren Lane home from the war, wearing the _Croix de  Guerre_.\"    Mrs. Wrapp pushed Lane forward, and stood there a moment in the sudden  silence, then stepping back, she went out and closed the door.    Lane saw a large well-lighted room, with colorful bizarre decorations  and a bare shiny floor. The first person his glance encountered was a  young girl, strikingly beautiful, facing him with red lips parted. She  had violet eyes that seemed to have a startled expression as they met  Lane's. Next Lane saw a slim young man standing close to this girl, in  the act of withdrawing his arm from around her waist. Apparently with  his free hand he had either been lowering a smoking cigarette from her  lips or had been raising it there. This hand, too, dropped down. Lane  did not recognize the fellow's smooth, smug face, with its tiny curled  mustache and its heated swollen lines.    \"Look who's here,\" shouted a gay, vibrant voice. \"If it isn't old Dare  Lane!\"    That voice drew Lane's fixed gaze, and he saw a group in the far  corner of the room. One man was standing, another was sitting beside a  lounge, upon which lay a young woman amid a pile of pillows. She rose  lazily, and as she slid off the lounge Lane saw her skirt come down  and cover her bare knees. Her red hair, bobbed and curly, marked her  for recognition. It was Helen. But Lane doubted if he would have at  once recognized any other feature. The handsome insolence of her face  was belied by a singularly eager and curious expression. Her eyes,  almost green in line, swept Lane up and down, and came back to his  face, while she extended her hands in greeting.    \"Helen, how are you?\" said Lane, with a cool intent mastery of  himself, bowing over her hands. \"Surprised to see me?\"    \"Well, I'll say so! Daren, you've changed,\" she replied, and the  latter part of her speech flashed swiftly.    \"Rather,\" he said, laconically. \"What would you expect? So have you  changed.\"    There came a moment's pause. Helen was not embarrassed or agitated,  but something about Lane or the situation apparently made her slow or  stiff.    \"Daren, you--of course you remember Hardy Mackay and Dick Swann,\" she  said.    Lane turned to greet one-time schoolmates and rivals of his. Mackay  was tall, homely, with a face that lacked force, light blue eyes and  thick sandy hair, brushed high. Swann was slight, elegant, faultlessly  groomed and he had a dark, sallow face, heavy lips, heavy eyelids,  eyes rather prominent and of a wine-dark hue. To Lane he did not have  a clean, virile look.    In their greetings Lane sensed some indefinable quality of surprise or  suspense. Swann rather awkwardly put out his hand, but Lane ignored  it. The blood stained Swann's sallow face and he drew himself up.    \"And Daren, here are other friends of mine,\" said Helen, and she  turned him round. \"Bessy, this is Daren Lane.... Miss Bessy Bell.\" As  Lane acknowledged the introduction he felt that he was looking at the  prettiest girl he had ever seen--the girl whose violet eyes had met  his when he entered the room.    \"Mr. Daren Lane, I'm very happy to meet some one from 'over there,'\"  she said, with the ease and self-possession of a woman of the world.  But when she smiled a beautiful, wonderful light seemed to shine from  eyes and face and lips--a smile of youth.    Helen introduced her companion as Roy Vancey. Then she led Lane to the  far corner, to another couple, manifestly disturbed from their rather  close and familiar position in a window seat. These also were  strangers to Lane. They did not get up, and they were not interested.  In fact, Lane was quick to catch an impression from all, possibly  excepting Miss Bell, that the courtesy of drawing rooms, such as he  had been familiar with as a young man, was wanting in this atmosphere.  Lane wondered if it was antagonism toward him. Helen drew Lane back  toward her other friends, to the lounge where she seated herself. If  the situation had disturbed her equilibrium in the least, the moment  had passed. She did not care what Lane"]]]
