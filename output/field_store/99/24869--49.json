We do not live in a world of dreams, but in an Universe which while  relative, is real so far as our lives and actions are concerned. Our  business in the Universe is not to deny its existence, but to LIVE,  using the Laws to rise from lower to higher--living on, doing the best  that we can under the circumstances arising each day, and living, so far  as is possible, to our biggest ideas and ideals. The true Meaning of  Life is not known to men on this plane .if, indeed, to any--but the  highest authorities, and our own intuitions, teach us that we will make  no mistake in living up to the best that is in us, so far as is  possible, and realising the Universal tendency in the same direction in  spite of apparent evidence to the contrary. We are all on The Path--and  the road leads upward ever, with frequent resting places.    Read the message of The Kybalion--and follow the example of \"the  wise\"--avoiding the mistake of \"the half-wise\" who perish by reason of  their folly.        CHAPTER VII    \"THE ALL\" IN ALL        \"While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE      ALL is in ALL.  To him who truly understands this      truth hath come great knowledge.\"--The Kybalion.    How often have the majority of people heard repeated the statement that  their Deity (called by many names) was \"All in All\" and how little have  they suspected the inner occult truth concealed by these carelessly  uttered words? The commonly used expression is a survival of the ancient  Hermetic Maxim quoted above. As the Kybalion says: \"To him who truly  understands this truth, hath come great knowledge.\" And, this being so,  let us seek this truth, the understanding of which means so much. In  this statement of truth--this Hermetic Maxim--is concealed one of the  greatest philosophical, scientific and religious truths.    We have given you the Hermetic Teaching regarding the Mental Nature of  the Universe--the truth that \"the Universe is Mental--held in the Mind  of THE ALL.\" As the Kybalion says, in the passage quoted above: \"All is  in THE ALL.\" But note also the co-related statement, that: \"It is  equally true that THE ALL is in ALL.\" This apparently contradictory  statement is reconcilable under the Law of Paradox. It is, moreover, an  exact Hermetic statement of the relations existing between THE ALL and  its Mental Universe. We have seen how \"All is in THE ALL\"--now let us  examine the other aspect of the subject.    The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that THE ALL is Imminent in  (\"remaining within; inherent; abiding within\") its Universe, and in  every part, particle, unit, or combination, within the Universe. This  statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the  Principle of Correspondence. The Teacher instructs the student to form a  Mental Image of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental  form, the favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming  an idea of his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of  an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student  will find that while the image has its existence, and being, solely  within his own mind, yet he, the student, author, dramatist, painter, or  sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in; remaining within; or abiding  within, the mental image also. In other words, the entire virtue, life,  spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the \"immanent  mind\" of the thinker. Consider this for a moment, until the idea is  grasped.    To take a modern example, let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear,  Richard III, existed merely in the mind of Shakespeare, at the time of  their conception or creation. And yet, Shakespeare also existed within  each of these characters, giving them their vitality, spirit, and  action. Whose is the \"spirit\" of the characters that we know as  Micawber, Oliver Twist, Uriah Heep--is it Dickens, or have each of these  characters a personal spirit, independent of their creator? Have the  Venus of Medici, the Sistine Madonna, the Apollo Belvidere, spirits and  reality of their own, or do they represent the spiritual and mental  power of their creators? The Law of Paradox explains that both  propositions are true, viewed from the proper viewpoints. Micawber is  both Micawber, and yet Dickens. And, again, while Micawber may be said  to be Dickens, yet Dickens is not identical with Micawber. Man, like  Micawber, may exclaim: \"The Spirit of my Creator is inherent within me--  and yet I am not HE!\" How different this from the shocking half-truth so  vociferously announced by certain of the half-wise, who fill the air  with their raucous cries of: \"I am God!\" Imagine poor Micawber, or the  sneaky Uriah Heep, crying: \"I Am Dickens\"; or some of the lowly clods in  one of Shakespeare's plays, eloquently announcing that: \"I Am  Shakespeare!\" THE ALL is in the earthworm, and yet the earth-worm is far  from being THE ALL. And still the wonder remains, that though the  earth-worm exists merely as a lowly thing, created and having its being  solely within the Mind of THE ALL--yet THE ALL is immanent in the  earthworm, and in the particles that go to make up the earth-worm. Can  there be any greater mystery than this of \"All in THE ALL; and THE ALL  in All?\"    The student will, of course, realize that the illustrations given above  are necessarily imperfect and inadequate, for they represent the  creation of mental images in finite minds, while the Universe is a  creation of Infinite Mind--and the difference between the two poles  separates them. And yet it is merely a matter of degree--the same  Principle is in operation--the Principle of Correspondence manifests in  each--\"As above, so Below; as Below, so above.\"    And, in the degree that Man realizes the existence of the Indwelling  Spirit immanent within his being, so will he rise in the spiritual scale  of life. This is what spiritual development means--the recognition,  realization, and manifestation of the Spirit within us. Try to remember  this last definition--that of spiritual development. It contains the  Truth of True Religion.    There are many planes of Being--many sub-planes of Life--many degrees of  existence in the Universe. And all depend upon the advancement of beings  in the scale, of which scale the lowest point is the grossest matter,  the highest being separated only by the thinnest division from the  SPIRIT of THE ALL. And, upward and onward along this Scale of Life,  everything is moving. All are on the Path, whose end is THE ALL. All  progress is a Returning Home. All is Upward and Onward, in spite of all  seemingly contradictory appearances. Such is the message of the  Illumined.    The Hermetic Teachings concerning the process of the Mental Creation of  the Universe, are that at the beginning of the Creative Cycle, THE ALL,  in its aspect of Being, projects its Will toward its aspect of  \"Becoming\" and the process of creation begins. It is taught that the  process consists of the lowering of Vibration until a very low degree of  vibratory energy is reached, at which point the grossest possible form  of Matter is manifested. This process is called the stage of Involution,  in which THE ALL becomes \"involved,\" or \"wrapped up,\" in its creation.  This process is believed by the Hermetists to have a Correspondence to  the mental process of an artist, writer, or inventor, who becomes so  wrapped up in his mental creation as to almost forget his own existence  and who, for the time being, almost \"lives in his creation,\" If instead  of \"wrapped\" we use the word \"rapt,\" perhaps we will give a better idea  of what is meant.    This Involuntary stage of Creation is sometimes called the \"Outpouring\"  of the Divine Energy, just as the Evolutionary state is called the  \"Indrawing.\" The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to  be the furthest removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the  Evolutionary stage is regarded as the beginning of the return swing of  the pendulum of Rhythm--a \"coming home\" idea being held in all of the  Hermetic Teachings.    The Teachings are that during the \"Outpouring,\" the vibrations become  lower and lower until finally the urge ceases, and the return swing  begins. But there is this difference, that while in the \"Outpouring\" the  creative forces manifest compactly and as a whole, yet from the  beginning of the Evolutionary or \"Indrawing\" stage, there is manifested  the Law of Individualization--that is, the tendency to separate into  Units of Force, so that finally that which left THE ALL as  unindividualized energy returns to its source as countless highly  developed Units of Life, having risen higher and higher in the scale by  means of Physical, Mental and Spiritual Evolution.    The ancient Hermetists use the word \"Meditation\" in describing the  process of the mental creation of the Universe in the Mind of THE ALL,  the word \"Contemplation\" also being frequently employed. But the idea  intended seems to be that of the employment of the Divine Attention.  \"Attention\" is a word derived from the Latin root, meaning \"to reach  out; to stretch out,\" and so the act of Attention is really a mental  \"reaching out; extension\" of mental energy, so that the underlying idea  is readily understood when we examine into the real meaning of  \"Attention.\"    The Hermetic Teachings regarding the process of Evolution are that, THE  ALL, having meditated upon the beginning of the Creation--having thus  established the material foundations of the Universe--having thought it  into existence--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#9)"],[1," so on. The    water does not change the '_places_,' but the several '_places_'    differentiate the water.[4] In the same way, the seed which is the    product of the four Elements is projected in all directions from    the earth-centre, and produces different things, according to the    quality of the different places. Thus, while the seed of all    things is one, it is made to generate a great variety of    things.... So long as Nature's seed remains in the centre it can    indifferently produce a tree or a metal, a herb or a stone, and in    like manner, according to the purity of the place, it will produce    what is less or more pure.\"       [4] The author I am quoting had said--\"Nature is divided into     four '_places_' in which she brings forth all things that     appear and that are in the shade; and according to the good or     bad quality of the '_place_,' she brings forth good or bad     things.... It is most important for us to know her '_places_'     ... in order that we may join things together according to     Nature.\"          CHAPTER V.    THE ALCHEMICAL ESSENCE.      In the last chapter I tried to describe the alchemical view of the  interdependence of different substances. Taking for granted the  tripartite nature of man, the co-existence in him of body, soul, and  spirit (no one of which was defined), the alchemists concluded that  all things are formed as man is formed; that in everything there is a  specific bodily form, some portion of soul, and a dash of spirit. I  considered the term _soul_ to be the alchemical name for the  properties common to a class of substances, and the term _spirit_ to  mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to  all things.    The alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in  four general classes, the marks whereof were expressed by the terms  hot, cold, moist, and dry; they thought of these properties as  typified by what they called the four Elements--fire, air, water, and  earth. Everything, they taught, was produced from the four Elements,  not immediately, but through the mediation of the three  Principles--mercury, sulphur, and salt. These Principles were regarded  as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the  transmutation of one substance into another. The Principles were not  thought of as definite substances, nor as properties of this or that  specified substance; they were considered to be the characteristic  properties of large classes of substances.    The chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because  all are acids, because all react similarly under similar conditions.  It used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of _the  principle of acidity_. Lavoisier changed the language whereby certain  facts concerning acids were expressed. He thought that experiments  proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen; and for many  years after Lavoisier, the alchemical expression _the principle of  acidity_ was superseded by the word _oxygen_. Although Lavoisier  recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid, he taught  that every acid is a compound of oxygen. We know now that many acids  are not compounds of oxygen, but we have not yet sufficient knowledge  to frame a complete definition of the term _acid_. Nevertheless it is  convenient, indeed it is necessary, to place together many compounds  which react similarly under certain defined conditions, and to give a  common name to them all. The alchemists also classified substances,  but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours; and  they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different  substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the  general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their  time.    The primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was  expressed by saying; these substances are rich in the principle  _sulphur_, those contain much of the principle _mercury_, and this  class is marked by the preponderance of the principle _salt_. The  secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying;  this class is characterised by dryness, that by moisture, another by  coldness, and a fourth by hotness; the dry substances contain much of  the element _Earth_, the moist substances are rich in the element  _Water_, in the cold substances the element _Air_ preponderates, and  the hot substances contain more of the element _Fire_ than of the  other elements.    The alchemists went a step further in their classification of things.  They asserted that there is One Thing present in all things; that  everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the  properties of the One Thing; that there is a Primal Element common to  all substances. The final aim of alchemy was to obtain the One Thing,  the Primal Element, the Soul of all Things, so purified, not only from  all specific substances, but also from all admixture of the four  Elements and the three Principles, as to make possible the  accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it.    If a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the Essence, he  might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion; it was necessary,  therefore, to know the conditions under which the potencies of the  Essence became active. Hence there was need of prolonged study of the  mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances, and of minute  and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs  her marvellous transmutations. The quest of the One Thing was fraught  with peril, and was to be attempted only by those who had served a  long and laborious apprenticeship.    In _The Chemical Treatise of Thomas Norton, the Englishman, called  Believe-me, or the Ordinal of Alchemy_ (15th century), the adept is  warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people.    \"You should carefully test and examine the life, character, and mental  aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this Art, and then  you should bind him, by a sacred oath, not to let our Magistery be  commonly or vulgarly known. Only when he begins to grow old and  feeble, he may reveal it to one person, but not to more, and that one  man must be virtuous.... If any wicked man should learn to practise  the Art, the event would be fraught with great danger to Christendom.  For such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation, and would  remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule  over the peoples of Christendom.\"    The results of the experimental examination of the compositions and  properties of substances, made since the time of the alchemists, have  led to the modern conception of the chemical element, and the  isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements. No substance  now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting  two, or more, distinct substances, nor has any been separated into  two, or more, unlike portions. The only decided change which a  chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it  with some other element or elements, or with a compound or compounds.    But it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations  of different quantities of one primal element. Certain facts make this  supposition tenable; and some chemists expect that the supposition  will be proved to be correct. If the hypothetical primal element  should be isolated, we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy, and  gained the One Thing; but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the  alchemists dreamed.    Inasmuch as the alchemical Essence was thought of as the Universal  Spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any  specific substance exhibits, it followed that the more perfect a  substance the greater is the quantity of the Essence in it. But even  in the most perfect substance found in nature--which substance, the  alchemists said, is gold--the Essence is hidden by wrappings of  specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising  it. Remove these wrappings from some special substance, and you have  the perfect form of that thing; you have some portion of the Universal  Spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things  whereof the particular substance is a member. Then remove the  class-property, often spoken of by the alchemists as _the life_, of  the substance, and you have the Essence itself.    The alchemists thought that to every thing, or at any rate to every  class of things, there corresponds a more perfect form than that which  we see and handle; they spoke of gold, and the _gold of the Sages_;  mercury, and the _mercury of the Philosophers_; sulphur, and the  _heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened_.    To remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present  themselves to the untrained senses, was regarded by the alchemists to  be a difficult task; to tear away the soul (the class-property) of a  substance, and yet retain the Essence which made that substance its  dwelling place, was possible only after vast labour, and by the use of  the proper agent working under the proper conditions. An exceedingly  powerful, delicate, and refined agent was needed; and the mastery of  the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience, and, probably,  after many disappointments.    \"Gold,\" an alchemist tells us, \"does not easily give up its nature,  and will fight for its life; but our agent is strong enough to  overcome and kill it, and then it also has the power to restore it to  life, and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body.\"    Thomas Norton, the author of _The Ordinal of Alchemy_, writing in the  15th century, says the worker in transmutations is often tempted to be  in a hurry, or to despair, and he is often deceived. His servants will  be either stupid and faithful, or quick-witted and false. He"]]]
