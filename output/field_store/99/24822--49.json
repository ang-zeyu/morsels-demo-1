The latter they call _par  excellence \"maha ledda_,\" the great \"sickness;\" they look upon it  as a special manifestation of _devidosay_, \"the displeasure of  the gods;\" and the attraction of the cheetahs to the bed of the  sufferer they attribute to the same indignant agency. A few years ago,  the capua, or demon-priest of a \"dewale,\" at Oggalbodda, a village  near Caltura, when suffering under small-pox, was devoured by a  cheetah, and his fate was regarded by those of an opposite faith as a  special judgment from heaven.    Such is the awe inspired by this belief in connection with the  small-pox, that a person afflicted with it is always approached as one  in immediate communication with the deity; his attendants, address him  as \"my lord,\" and \"your lordship,\" and exhaust on him the whole series  of honorific epithets in which their language abounds for approaching  personages of the most exalted rank. At evening and morning, a lamp is  lighted before him, and invoked with prayers to protect his family from  the dire calamity which has befallen himself. And after his recovery,  his former associates refrain from communication with him until a  ceremony shall have been performed by the capua, called  _awasara-pandema_, or \"the offering of lights for permission,\" the  object of which is to entreat permission of the deity to regard him as  freed from the divine displeasure, with liberty to his friends to renew  their intercourse as before.    Major SKINNER, who for upwards of forty years has had occasionally to  live for long periods in the interior, occupied in the prosecution of  surveys and the construction of roads, is strongly of opinion that the  disposition of the leopard towards man is essentially pacific, and  that, when discovered, its natural impulse is to effect its escape. In  illustration of this I insert an extract from one of his letters,  which describes an adventure highly characteristic of this instinctive  timidity:--    \"On the occasion of one of my visits to Adam's Peak, in the prosecution  of my military reconnoissances of the mountain zone, I fixed on a pretty  little patena (_i.e._, meadow) in the midst of an extensive and dense  forest in the southern segment of the Peak Range, as a favourable spot  for operations. It would have been difficult, after descending from the  cone of the peak, to have found one's way to this point, in the midst of  so vast a wilderness of trees, had not long experience assured me that  good game tracks would be found leading to it, and by one of them I  reached it. It was in the afternoon, just after one of those tropical  sunshowers that decorate every branch and blade with pendant brilliants,  and the little patena was covered with game, either driven to the open  space by the drippings from the leaves or tempted by the freshness of  the pasture: there were several pairs of elk, the bearded antlered male  contrasting finely with his mate; and other varieties of game in a  profusion not to be found in any place frequented by man. It was some  time before I would allow them to be disturbed by the rude fall of the  axe, in our necessity to establish our bivouac for the night, and they  were so unaccustomed to danger that it was long before they took alarm  at our noises.    \"The following morning, anxious to gain a height for my observations  in time to avail myself of the clear atmosphere of sunrise, I started  off by myself through the jungle, leaving orders for my men, with my  surveying instruments, to follow my track by the notches which I cut  in the bark of the trees. On leaving the plain, I availed myself of a  fine wide game track which lay in my direction, and had gone, perhaps,  half a mile from the camp, when I was startled by a slight rustling in  the nilloo[1] to my right, and in another instant, by the spring of a  magnificent leopard, which, in a bound of full eight feet in height  over the lower brushwood, lighted at my feet within eighteen inches of  the spot whereon I stood, and lay in a crouching position, his fiery  gleaming eyes fixed on me.    [Footnote 1: A species of one of the suffruticose _Acanthaccae_  (Strobilanthes), which grows, abundantly in the mountain ranges of  Ceylon.]    \"The predicament was not a pleasant one. I had no weapon of defence, and  with one spring or blow of his paw the beast could have annihilated me.  To move I knew would only encourage his attack. It occurred to me at the  moment that I had heard of the power of man's eye over wild animals, and  accordingly I fixed my gaze as intently as the agitation of such a  moment enabled me on his eyes: we stared at each other for some seconds,  when, to my inexpressible joy, the beast turned and bounded down the  straight open path before me. This scene occurred just at that period of  the morning when the grazing animals retired from the open patena to the  cool shade of the forest: doubtless, the leopard had taken my approach  for that of a deer, or some such animal. And if his spring had been at a  quadruped instead of a biped, his distance was so well measured, that it  must have landed him on the neck of a deer, an elk, or a buffalo; as it  was, one pace more would have done for me. A bear would not have let his  victim off so easily.\"    Notwithstanding the unequalled agility of the monkey, it falls a prey,  and not unfrequently, to the leopard. The latter, on approaching a tree  on which a troop of monkeys have taken shelter, causes an instant and  fearful excitement, which they manifest by loud and continued screams,  and incessant restless leaps from branch to branch. The leopard  meanwhile walks round and round the tree, with his eyes firmly fixed  upon his victims, till at last exhausted by terror, and prostrated by  vain exertions to escape, one or more falls a prey to his voracity. So  rivetted is the attention of both during the struggle, that a sportsman,  on one occasion, attracted by the noise, was enabled to approach within  an uncomfortable distance of the leopard, before he discovered the cause  of the unusual dismay amongst the monkeys overhead.    It is said, but I have never been able personally to verify the fact,  that the leopard of Ceylon exhibits a peculiarity in being unable  entirely to retract its claws within their sheaths.    There is another piece of curious folk lore, in connexion with the  leopard. The natives assert that it devours the _kaolin_ clay  called by them _kiri-mattie_[1] in a very peculiar way. They say  that the cheetah places it in lumps beside him, and then gazes  intently on the sun, till on turning his eyes on the clay, every piece  appears of a red colour like flesh, when he instantly devours it.    [Footnote 1: See Sir J.E. TENNENT'S _Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 31.]    They likewise allege that the female cheetah never produces more than  one litter of whelps.    Of the _lesser feline species_, the number and variety in Ceylon  is inferior to those of India. The Palm-cat[1] lurks by day among the  fronds of the coco-nut palms, and by night makes destructive forays on  the fowls of the villagers; and, in order to suck the blood of its  victim, inflicts a wound so small as to be almost imperceptible. The  glossy genette[2], the \"_Civet_\" of Europeans, is common in the  northern province, where the Tamils confine it in cages for the sake  of its musk, which they collect from the wooden bars on which it rubs  itself. Edrisi, the Moorish geographer, writing in the twelfth  century, enumerates musk as one of the productions then exported from  Ceylon.[3]    [Footnote 1: Paradoxurus typus, _F. Cuv._]    [Footnote 2: Viverra Indica, _Geoffr., Hodgs._]    [Footnote 3: EDRISI, _Geogr._ sec. vii. Jauberts's translation,  t. ii. p. 72. In connexion with cats, a Singhalese gentleman has  described to me a plant in Ceylon, called _Cuppa-mayniya_ by the  natives; by which he says cats are so enchanted, that they play with  it as they would with, a captured mouse; throwing if into the air,  watching it till it falls, and crouching to see if it will move. It  would be worth inquiring into the truth of this; and the explanation  of the attraction.]    _Dogs_.--There is no native wild dog in Ceylon, but every village  and town is haunted by mongrels of European descent, that are known by  the generic description of _Pariahs_. They are a miserable race,  lean, wretched, and mangy, acknowledged by no owners, living on the  garbage of the streets and sewers, and if spoken to unexpectedly they  shrink with an almost involuntary cry. Yet in these persecuted  outcasts there survives that germ of instinctive affection which binds  the dog to the human race, and a gentle word, even a look of  compassionate kindness, is sufficient foundation for a lasting  attachment.    The Singhalese, from their religious aversion to taking away life in any  form, permit the increase of these desolate creatures till in the hot  season they become so numerous as to be a nuisance; and the only  expedient hitherto devised by the civil government to reduce their  numbers, is once in each year to offer a reward for their destruction,  when the Tamils and Malays pursue them in the streets with clubs (guns  being forbidden by the police for fear of accidents), and the  unresisting dogs are beaten to death on the side-paths and door-steps  where they had been taught to resort for food. Lord Torrington, during  his government of Ceylon, attempted the more civilised experiment of  putting some check on their numbers, by imposing a dog-tax, the effect  of which would have been to lead to the drowning of puppies; whereas  there is reason to believe that dogs are at present _bred_ by the  horse-keepers to be killed for sake of the reward.    The Pariahs of Colombo exhibit something of the same instinct, by  which the dogs in other eastern cities "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#9)"],[1,"octagonal       masonry which surrounds it. The effect in a storm is       surprising and satisfactory. While the wind blows high       against the vane and spire, the pendulum floor touches on       the lee side, and its aperture is double on the windward: at       the cessation, it oscillates slightly, and terminates in a       perpendicular. The rest of the spire is quite clear of       scaffolding. This contrivance is doubtless one of the most       ingenious and appropriate of its great inventor's       applications.\"    About 1814 T. King made a plan of the whole building and several  drawings of the church as it then appeared. One of these [25] shows  some carefully copied specimens of the decorations on the vaults. The  engraving was published in 1831, and on it is the statement, \"Painted  1520. Erased 1817.\" Another drawing showed the interior of the choir  looking west. In this was represented in careful detail the design of  the eastern elevation of the organ-case and the \"return\" stalls  against the Arundel screen. It also shows the original iron gates in  the archway, which pierced the screen in the centre below the organ,  and formed the entrance to the choir. These gates were evidently  copied in design from the thirteenth-century iron screen that  protected the sanctuary, part of which is now in the Victoria and  Albert Museum. In the distance the decoration on the nave vaulting is  lightly indicated. There is also an original drawing by T. King in the  possession of the Chapter, which gives a view looking eastwards.  Another drawing [26] which was made some time after 1829 shows the  choir looking east towards the reredos. It is a careful study, and is  of peculiar interest, since it is a record of many features now  entirely removed. The early reredos appears still in its place, but  the upper portion of it is gone. This was a gallery which was  accessible from either triforium, across which boys early in the  century used to run races by starting up the staircase in one aisle  and down that in the other. The absence of the gallery in the drawing  shows that it was made after 1829, the year in which the gallery was  removed. The \"glory\" which was added to the reredos during the  eighteenth century appears just above the altar. On the south side of  the choir are some spectators in the gallery above the stalls. There  were also at this time other galleries on the north and south of the  sanctuary, and above the arch on the east side of the north arm of the  transept was a gallery too. To this last there was access from the  staircase that led to the chamber above the east chapel of the  transept close by. These drawings show what the interior of the church  was like up to the time when that extraordinary revival of activity in  matters ecclesiastical began in the nineteenth century.      [25] See illustrations, pp. 33 and 125.    [26] Supposed to be by Carter, an architect of Winchester.    Like other churches, that at Chichester felt the sting of controversy  in unnecessary vandalism. But it may be admitted that destruction,  like a storm, carried at least some virtue in its clouds. In  attempting to sweep away the accumulated refuse heaped within the  building, some precious things fell before the broom of zealous  furnishers, and were lost for ever in the dust raised by this new  cleansing dream.    [Illustration: THE NAVE, ABOUT 1836. _From Winkles's Cathedral  Churches_.]    The removal of the gallery above the old fifteenth-century reredos in  1829 was the beginning of a serious attempt to repair, restore, and  reanimate the fabric. This revival of faith began to try to do good  works--but not always with discretion, not always with knowledge,  wisdom, and taste. Here was rash ardour, often without the hesitation  of true reverence.    [Illustration: THE RETRO-CHOIR AND REREDOS, ABOUT 1836. _From  Winkles's Cathedral Churches_.]    It is certain the building was not all it should have been when these  works were begun; it is not what it might have been had some of them  been deferred. Consequently any illustrations which show its condition  before the middle of the nineteenth century are of interest and value  to those who would know what changes have been made.    In Winkles's essay on Chichester, in his \"Cathedrals of England,\"  published between 1830 and 1840, are many beautiful drawings of the  fabric. There is one which shows the Arundel screen still in its  original position with the organ above it; and in another the complete  design of the back of the reredos appears. These careful studies of  the building, which were made before it became so changed by the  removal of its best remaining treasures, help to convey some idea of  what the place was before it was so radically \"restored.\"    None of the drawings, however, show any of the beautiful decorations  of the vaults, for all this had been smeared over with a dirty yellow  wash about 1815, which earned for the church the name of \"the leather  breeches cathedral.\" And when, later, the plaster on the stone-filling  between the ribs was removed, the paintings were utterly obliterated  for ever, excepting only the small portion remaining in the  lady-chapel bearing the Wykeham motto upon a scroll. But this recital  is but a prelude to the changes that were to follow. The energy of  revival found expression in many ways, and English architecture  suffered sorely at the hands of ardent ignorance. But the very desire  to deal well with the fabrics of our churches that were to be repaired  taught men to study closely the facts of archaeology. The studies had  a practical end, and at Chichester they found their opportunity in the  cathedral.    But first a new church of S. Peter was built in West Street in 1853,  so that the north arm of the transept should no longer be used as it  had been for about four hundred years. Then not long afterwards Dean  Chandler, at his death, left a large sum to be used for the purpose of  decorating the cathedral. To this sum other funds were added. The need  that more space should be provided for the congregation arose, and to  satisfy this it was decided that the choir should be opened out to the  nave. Consequently, in 1859 the work of decoration was begun by the  removal of the Arundel screen with the eighteenth-century organ above  it--one of the most beautiful remnants of the art of earlier days that  remained in the cathedral. The object of this act was most admirable,  but it involved in addition the destruction of the fourteenth-century  \"return\" stalls which were on the eastern face of the doomed screen.  In taking down the screen, or shrine, all the stones composing it had  been carefully numbered, with the intention that it should be rebuilt  in a new position. But although these materials are still wantonly  distributed about the cathedral and precincts, no attempt has been  made to use them again, either as a screen or as an evidence to show  by contrast that the result has justified the change. Its removal was  the beginning of a series of alterations, both by accident and design.  The old reredos, that quiet and beautiful witness of things so sacred  and some so profane, was torn away. The whole of the choir was to be  rearranged. But when the piers of the central tower were exposed by  the removal of the screen, it was discovered that they were in a  precariously rotten condition at the core. Other indications of  weakness, which had been overlooked before, were now observed. Large  and deep cracks and various earlier signs of apprehended weakness both  in arches and piers were remarked. That the work now begun had given  impetus to the fall has been denied on excellent authority, and to  discuss such a question at this time is useless. The serious trouble  now was that the whole tower with the spire was rapidly settling on  its base. Every method that could be used was tried in order to save  the piers. They were propped up with shores, and the arches held up  with centres, while new masonry was bonded into the older work. But  the labour availed nothing, for towards the end of the year 1860  matters had developed seriously.         \"Old fissures extended themselves into the fresh masonry,       and new ones made their appearance.... But in the next       place, the walling began to bulge towards the end of January       1861, first in the north-west pier, and afterwards in the       south. Cracks and fissures, some opening and others closing,       and the gradual deformation of the arches in the transept       walls and elsewhere, indicated that fearful movements were       taking place throughout the parts of the wall connected with       the western piers.\"    On Sunday, February 17th,        \"the afternoon service was performed in the nave of the      cathedral, as usual, but ... was interrupted by the urgent      necessity for shoring up a part of the facing of the      south-west pier.... On Wednesday, crushed mortar began to      pour from the old fissures, flakes of the facing stone fell,      and the braces began to bend. Yet the workmen continued to      add shoring until three hours and a half past midnight.\"    Next day the effort was resumed before daybreak; but by noon         \"the continual failing of the shores showed, too plainly,       that the fall was inevitable.\"    Just before half-past one         \"the spire was seen to incline slightly to the south-west,       and then to descend perpendicularly into the church, as one       telescope tube slides into another, the mass of the tower       crumbling beneath it. The fall was an affair of a few       seconds, and was complete at half-past one.\"    Such, briefly, is the record of the fall, which so admirably has been  related by Professor Willis, from whose work these extracts have been  taken.    Sir Gilbert Scott, [27] after the central tower had collapsed, was  consulted concerning its reconstruction. He"]]]
