[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],[0,"Studies of Trees (#9)"],[1,"ry.]    Distinguishing characters: The *bud* is the largest among the      hickories--nearly half an inch long--is hard and oval and covered      with _yellowish brown_ downy _scales_ which _do not project_ like      those of the shagbark hickory, see Fig. 69. The twigs are extremely      coarse. The *bark* is very tight on the trunk and branches and has a      _close_, hard, _wavy_ appearance as in Fig. 70.    Leaf: The leaf consists of 5, 7 or 9 leaflets all of which are large and      pubescent and possess a distinct resinous odor.    Form and size: A tall tree with a broad spreading head.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: The mockernut hickory grows on a great variety of      soils, but prefers one which is rich and well-drained.    Enemies: The same as for the shagbark hickory.    Value for planting: It is not commonly planted.    Commercial value: The wood is similar to that of the shagbark hickory      and is put to the same uses.    Other characters: The fruit is a nut, larger and covered with a shell      thicker than that of the shagbark. The husk is also thicker and      separates into four segments nearly to the base. The kernel is small      and sweet.    Other common names: _Bigbud hickory_; _whiteheart hickory_.    Comparisons: The _pignut hickory_ (_Hicoria glabra_), sometimes called      broom hickory or brown hickory, often has a shaggy bark, but differs      from both the shagbark and the mockernut hickory in possessing buds      very much smaller, twigs more slender and leaflets fewer. The nut      has a thinner husk which does not separate into four or five      segments. The tree prefers drier ground than the other hickories.    [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Bud of the Mockernut Hickory.]        The _bitternut_ (_Hicoria minima_) can be told from the mockernut      and other species of hickory by its bud, which has no scales at all.      The color of its bud is a characteristic orange yellow. The bark is      of a lighter shade than the bark of the mockernut hickory and the      leaflets are more numerous than in any of the hickories, varying      from 7 to 11. Its nuts are bitter.      BLACK WALNUT (_Juglans nigra_)    Distinguishing characters: By cutting a twig lengthwise, it will be seen      that its *pith* is divided into little _chambers_ as shown in Fig.      71. The bud is dark gray and satiny. The bark is dark brown and      deeply ridged and the fruit is the familiar round walnut.    [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Bark of the Mockernut Hickory.]    Form and size: A tall tree with a spreading crown composed of stout      branches. In the open it grows very symmetrically.    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: The black walnut prefers a deep, rich, fertile soil      and requires a great deal of light.    Enemies: The tree is a favorite of many caterpillars.    Value for planting: It forms a beautiful spreading tree on open ground,      but is not planted to any extent because it is hard to transplant.      It grows slowly unless the soil is very deep and rich, develops its      leaves late in the spring and sheds them early in the fall and      produces its fruit in great profusion.    Commercial value: The wood is heavy, strong, of chocolate brown color      and capable of taking a fine polish. It is used for cabinet making      and interior finish of houses. The older the tree, usually, the      better the wood, and the consumption of the species in the past has      been so heavy that it is becoming rare. The European varieties which      are frequently planted in America as substitutes for the native      species yield better nuts, but the American species produces better      wood.    [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Twig of the Black Walnut. Note the large  chambers in the pith.]    [Illustration: FIG. 72.--Twig of the Butternut. Note the small chambers  in the pith.]    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large round nut about two inches in      diameter, covered with a smooth husk which at first is dull green      in color and later turns brown. The husk does not separate into      sections. The kernel is edible and produces an oil of commercial      value.        The _leaves_ are compound and alternate with 15 to 23 leaflets to      each.    Comparisons: The _butternut_ (_Juglans cinerea_) is another tree that      has the pith divided into little chambers, but the little chambers      here are shorter than in the black walnut, as may be seen from a      comparison of Figs. 71 and 72. The bark of the butternut is light      gray while that of the black walnut is dark. The buds in the      butternut are longer than those of the black walnut and are light      brown instead of gray in color. The form of the tree is low and      spreading as compared with the black walnut. The fruit in the      butternut is elongated while that of the black walnut is round. The      leaves of the butternut have fewer leaflets and these are lighter in      color.        GROUP X. TULIP TREE, SWEET GUM, LINDEN, MAGNOLIA, LOCUST, CATALPA,  DOGWOOD, MULBERRY AND OSAGE ORANGE      TULIP TREE (_Liriodendron tulipifera_)    Distinguishing characters: There are four characters that stand out      conspicuously in the tulip tree--the *bud*, the *trunk*, the      persistent *fruit cups* and the wedged *leaf*.        The bud, Fig. 74, about three-quarters of an inch long, is covered      by two purplish scales which lend special significance to its whole      appearance. The trunk is extremely individual because it rises stout      and shaft-like, away above the ground without a branch as shown in      Fig. 73. The tree flowers in the latter part of May but the cup that      holds the fruit persists throughout the winter. The leaf, Fig. 75,      has four lobes, is nearly as broad as it is long and so notched at      the upper end that it looks different from any other leaf.    [Illustration: FIG. 73.--The Tulip Tree.]    [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Bud of the Tulip Tree.]    Form and size: The tulip tree is one of the largest, stateliest and      tallest of our trees.    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: Requires a deep, moist soil.    Enemies: Comparatively free from insects and disease.    Value for planting: The tree has great value as a specimen on the lawn      but is undesirable as a street tree because it requires considerable      moisture and transplants with difficulty. It should be planted while      young and where it can obtain plenty of light. It grows rapidly.    Commercial value: The wood is commercially known as _whitewood_ and      _yellow poplar_. It is light, soft, not strong and easily worked. It      is used in construction, for interior finish of houses, woodenware      and shingles. It has a medicinal value.    Other characters: The _flower_, shown in Fig. 75, is greenish yellow in      color, appears in May and resembles a tulip; hence the name tulip      tree. The _fruit_ is a cone.    Other common names: _Whitewood_; _yellow poplar_; _poplar_ and _tulip      poplar_.      SWEET GUM (_Liquidambar styraciflua_)    [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Leaf and Flower of the Tulip Tree.]    Distinguishing characters: The _persistent, spiny_, long-stemmed round      *fruit*; _the corky growths on the_ *twigs*, the characteristic      _star-shaped_ *leaves* (Fig. 76) and the very shiny greenish brown      buds and the perfect symmetry of the tree are the chief characters      by which to identify the species.    Form and size: The sweet gum has a beautiful symmetrical shape, forming      a true monopodium.    [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Leaf and Fruit of the Sweet Gum. Note the corky  ridges along the twig.]    Range: From Connecticut to Florida and west to Missouri.    Soil and location: Grows in any good soil but prefers low wet ground. It      grows rapidly and needs plenty of light.    Enemies: Is very often a favorite of leaf-eating caterpillars.    Value for planting: The tree is sought for the brilliant color of its      foliage in the fall, and is suitable for planting both on the lawn      and street. In growing the tree for ornamental purposes it is      important that it should be frequently transplanted in the nursery      and that it be transported with burlap wrapping around its roots.    Commercial value: The wood is reddish brown in color, tends to splinter      and is inclined to warp in drying. It is used in cooperage, veneer      work and for interior finish.    Other characters: On the smaller branches there are irregular      developments of cork as shown in Fig. 76, projecting in some cases      to half an inch in thickness.    Other common names: _Red gum_.    Comparisons: The _cork elm_ is another tree that possesses corky ridges      along its twigs, but this differs from the sweet gum in wanting the      spiny fruit and its other distinctive traits.      AMERICAN LINDEN (_Tilia Americana_)    [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Bud of the Linden Tree.]    Distinguishing characters: The great distinguishing feature of any      linden is the *one-sided* character of its *bud* and *leaf*. The      bud, dark red and conical, carries a sort of protuberance which      makes it extremely one sided as shown in Fig. 77. The leaf, Fig. 78,      is heart-shaped with the side nearest the branch largest.    [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Leaves and Flowers of the European Linden.]    Form and size: The American Linden is a medium-sized tree with a broad      round head.    Range: Eastern North America and more common in the north than in the      south.    Soil and location: Requires a rich, moist soil.    [Illustration: FIG. 79.--European Linden Tree.]    [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Bud of the Umbrella Tree.]    Enemies: Its leaves are a favorite food of caterpillars and its wood is      frequently attacked by a boring insect known as the _linden borer_      (_Saperda vestita_).    Value for planting: The linden is easily transplanted and grows rapidly.  It is used for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#9)"],[1,"\"corrected by the religious of the orders\"--by these  two Dominicans. In their editorial work they may have been helped  by Juan de la Cruz, who, we have noted, was sent to Bataan in 1588,  there learned Tagalog, and \"succeeded so perfectly with it that Father  Fr. Francisco San Joseph, who was afterwards the best linguist there,  profited by the papers and labors of P. Fr. Juan de la Cruz.\" [119]  Juan de Oliver, the pioneer Franciscan Tagalist was still living and  available for consultation, and the polylingual Jesuit, Francisco  Almerique, also was in Manila at the time. A Chinese text had been  written by Juan Cobo, and both Nieva and San Pedro Martyr were capable  of preparing this for publication, again possibly aided by Almerique,  and also Diego Munoz, if as an Augustinian he had been willing to  cooperate with the Dominicans. Nothing remained to be done but have  the blocks cut and the impressions pulled.        THE PRINTING OF THE BOOKS      The stage was set for the production of the Doctrinas. That there  were Chinese xylographic models upon which the books could be based  is evidenced by the account of Mendoza of the considerable number of  Chinese books brought to Manila by Martin de Rada as early as 1575. A  more likely model was a bilingual text in Spanish and Chinese which  Cobo describes in his letter of July 13, 1589, where speaking of the  Jesuits in China he says:          \"Moreover the Father of the Company who was in China wrote and      printed in Chinese letters a whole book of the unity of God,      the creation of the world, and the commandments explained;      and in this book has gotten as far as the incarnation of      the Son of God. Concerning this I am not speaking of things      heard, for I have it, and am thus certain of it, as of all      the things that happened. How far I have progressed with the      Chinese letters I shall say later. This book was printed in      China in 1584. It circulates freely in China whence we have      our copy, and because of the writing, contrary to what others      have misleadingly said about the Chinese, they have done him      no ill: from which it may be inferred that the lion is not      so wild as they paint him.\" [120]      There is no direct evidence to support our belief that it was during  the brief period after Castro returned, probably late in 1590, and  relieved Cobo of his executive responsibilities, and June 1592 when he  left for Japan, that Cobo began intensive plans for the production of  bilingual texts. His recorded interest in such books, his influence  with the Chinese, his energy and his own linguistic aptitude would  naturally have stimulated him to undertake the task. Whether he  actually began work on the blocks from which the books were printed,  or merely suggested the feasibility of the idea, we do not know,  but we feel sure that Juan Cobo was the father of the production of  books in the Philippines.    There is no need here to go into the history of printing in China;  the method used there and its antiquity have been fully described  by others. [121] That there were Chinese in Manila who understood  this age-old process would seem obvious from the reports of skilled  craftsmen whose presence was noted by all the writers of the period. We  have already quoted a reference to Juan Cobo's teaching them European  trades, and Salazar in his already cited letter speaks of them further:          \"They are so skillful and clever, that, as soon as they see      any object made by a Spanish workman, they reproduce it with      exactness. What arouses my wonder most is, that when I arrived      no Sangley knew how to paint anything; but now they have      so perfected themselves in this art that they have produced      marvelous works with both the brush and the chisel.... What has      pleased all of us here has been the arrival of a bookbinder      from Mexico. He brought books with him, set up a bindery,      and hired a Sangley who had offered his services to him. The      Sangley secretly, and without his master noticing it, watched      how the latter bound books, and lo, in less than [lacuna in      MS.] he left the house, saying that he wished to serve him      no longer, and set up a similar shop.\" [122]      To turn over a manuscript copy of a book to a Chinaman who had already  some familiarity with the production of books in China, or who with a  given text could carve the blocks according to tradition, was then not  a matter of great difficulty. There were Chinese books which showed  what the result would be; there were Spanish books, definitely some  from Mexico, which provided samples of European characters and format.    Who cut the blocks--that is exactly what Chinaman--we do not know,  nor do we know who handled the presswork, but it is logical to assume  that the whole process took place under the supervision of the fathers  of San Gabriel, Juan Cobo if work had begun before 1592, and certainly  Nieva and San Pedro Martyr. One further aide may have been the lay  brother, Pedro Rodriguez, who had been sent to San Gabriel with Nieva,  and who was a handyman or skilled mechanic, for Aduarte credits him  with rebuilding and restoring the hospital.    In speaking of the book printed for Blancas de San Jose, Aduarte said  that the printing had been done by \"a Chinaman, a good Christian,\"  [123] but in this particular account he does not give the Chinaman's  name. Yet, where he describes the founding of a second church of San  Gabriel in Binondo, sometime after March 28, 1594 [124] and before  June 15, 1596 when it was admitted to the chapter, he tells in some  detail of printing done by Juan de Vera. [125]          \"There have been in this town [Binondo, then called Minondoc]      many Chinese of very exemplary lives. Juan de Vera was      not only a very devout man, and one much given to prayer,      but a man who caused all his household to be the same. He      always heard mass, and was very regular in his attendance at      church. He adorned the church most handsomely with hangings      and paintings, because he understood this art. He also,      thinking only of the great results to be attained by means      of holy and devout books, gave himself to the great labor      necessary to establish printing in this country, where there      was no journeyman who could show him the way, or give him an      account of the manner of printing in Europe, which is very      different from the manner of printing followed in his own      country of China. The Lord aided his pious intentions, and      he gave to this undertaking not only continued and excessive      labor, but all the forces of his mind, which were great. In      spite of the difficulties, he attained that which he desired,      and was the first printer in these islands; and this not from      avarice--for he gained much more in his business as a merchant,      and readily gave up his profit--but merely to do service to      the Lord and this good to the souls of the natives.\" [126]      It is interesting to note that this narrative, which is in substance  similar to that about the books of Blancas de San Jose, nowhere  mentions the name of the priest in connection with Vera. It is probable  that Juan de Vera was, as Retana believed, the first typographer, and  it may be that he also printed the Doctrinas of 1593. It is impossible  to say with certainty, but it is not too fanciful to suppose that  Juan de Vera tried xylographic printing under the supervision of  Nieva and San Pedro Martyr, and after some experimenting achieved  typography in the time of Blancas de San Jose.    Since we have here dealt with a volume printed entirely from  wood-blocks it does not seem necessary to discuss in detail the  subsequent typographical books. However, just as this goes to press,  a copy of the _Ordinationes Generales prouintiae Sanctissimi Rosarij  Philippinarum_, [127] printed at Binondo by Juan de Vera in 1604,  has been discovered, and also presented by Mr. Rosenwald to the  Library of Congress. This is the volume described by Remesal [128]  as being printed \"in as fine characters and as correctly as if in  Rome or Lyon.\" No copy of the book had been described since his day,  although Medina [129] and Retana [130] both listed it from references  which probably derived from Remesal. Its discovery--almost unbelievable  coming so close on the heels of that of the Doctrina--helps to close  the gap between the latter and the two Bataan imprints [131] of 1610,  the _Arte y Reglas de la Lengva Tagala_ and the _Librong Pagaaralan  nang manga Tagalog nang uicang Castilla_.    The full story of the early typographical products of the Philippines  must wait upon another occasion, for the questions posed by the scanty  records and the handful of surviving books are extremely knotty. Where  did the type come from? Medina suggested it was imported from Macao;  Retana believed it to have been cut in the Philippines. Fernandez  said that the first works of Blancas de San Jose were printed at  Bataan and the two 1610 books have that place of printing, yet in  1604 the _Ordinationes_ issued from Binondo. Remesal wrote that this  book was printed by Francisco de Vera, and the book itself bears the  name of Juan. Indeed, the history of the early typographers and the  output of their presses, as it has so far been written, presents many  problems, but they are problems which we feel are outside the scope  of this study.    To summarize what we have learned of the earliest printing in the  Philippines: we have the possibility, but not a likely one, that  an _Arte_ by Juan de Quinones was printed xylographically in 1581;  we know that in the first half of the year 1593 two Doctrinas were  printed xylographically--although we have no way of telling which  came first--one in Tagalog from the Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver text,  and one in Chinese written by Juan Cobo, both"]]]
