They  certainly are a conceited lot. Here comes the goose.\"      III      The goose waddled over to the mirror.    \"Well, well! If there isn't a new goose!\" she said, \"and she is walking  toward me. I must be friendly.\"    Snap! Her bill struck the mirror.    \"Oh, you are in a glass box!\" she said. \"Have you come to stay?\" And she  stretched out her neck.    \"My, but you have a long neck!\" she went on, \"and your feathers are nice  and smooth. I suppose you cannot hear in that box.\"    Then she walked away, nodding good-by. The other goose, of course,  nodded also, and goosey went away satisfied.    \"She is not so much of a goose as the others,\" the cat remarked.    \"The peacock is coming,\" said the dog. \"Keep quiet.\"    In walked the peacock. Seeing another bird, as he supposed, he spread  his beautiful tail to its full width. He walked about, but never a word  did he say.    \"Now, what do you make out of that?\" asked the dog. \"Did he know that he  was looking in a looking-glass, or wouldn't he speak to another bird?\"    \"I do not know,\" said the cat, \"but here comes the goat. Hide, quick!\"    Billy was clattering over the boards, when suddenly he saw the other  goat. He looked at him a minute. \"I'll show him,\" he said, running at  the mirror with head down.    [Illustration: The goat crashes into the mirror]    Bang! Smash! Crash! and Billy jumped back, a very much astonished goat.    \"Now you have done it,\" said the horse, who had been watching all the  time from his stall. \"All the animals will get out and run away.\"    \"What are you talking about?\" said the dog, who was laughing so hard he  could scarcely talk. \"There are no animals in there. That is a  looking-glass; you see yourself when you are in front of it.\"    \"Do you mean to tell me that those animals have all been looking at  themselves and finding fault with their own looks?\" asked the horse,  with his eyes nearly popping out of his head.    \"Of course,\" said the cat. \"Can't you see that Billy has smashed the  looking-glass?\"    \"Well, that is the best I ever heard,\" said the horse, laughing, \"but I  wish I had known that was a looking-glass before Billy broke it. I  should very much like to know how I look.\"    \"You might not have recognized yourself; the others didn't,\" said the  dog.    --F.A. WALKER.          THE BARBER OF BAGDAD    ACT I      PLACE: Ali's barber shop.    TIME: Morning.    WOODCUTTER: I have a load of wood which I have just brought in on my  donkey. Would you like to buy it, good barber?    ALI: Well, let me see. Is it good wood?    WOODCUTTER: The best in the country.    ALI: I'll give you five shekels for all the wood upon the donkey.    WOODCUTTER: Agreed. I'll put the wood here by your door.    (Lays wood at door.)    Now, good sir, give me the silver.    ALI: Not so fast, my good friend. I must have your wooden pack saddle,  too. That was the bargain. I said, \"All the wood upon your donkey.\"  Truly, the saddle is wood.    [Illustration: Ali and the woodcutter with the donkey]    WOODCUTTER: Who ever heard of such a bargain? Surely you cannot mean  what you say? You would not treat a poor woodcutter so. It is  impossible.    ALI: Give me the saddle, or I'll have you put in prison. And take  that--and that--and that!    (Ali strikes the woodcutter.)    WOODCUTTER: Ah, me, what shall I do? What shall I do? I know. I'll go to  the caliph himself.      ACT II      PLACE: Caliph's Palace.    TIME: Hour later.    COURTIER: My lord, a good woodcutter is at the door and begs leave to  come into your presence.    CALIPH: Bid him enter. There is none too poor to be received by me.    (Courtier goes out and returns with woodcutter, who kneels and kisses  the ground. Then he stands with arms folded.)    CALIPH: Tell me, good man, what brought you here? Has any one done you a  wrong?    WOODCUTTER: Great wrong, my lord. The rich barber Ali did buy a load of  wood from me. He offered me five shekels for all the wood on my donkey.  When I had put down the load, I asked for my money, but he refused to  pay me until I had given him my pack saddle. He said the bargain was  \"all the wood on the donkey,\" and that the saddle is wood. He said he  would put me in prison if I did not give up the saddle. Then he took it  and drove me away with blows.    CALIPH: A strange story, truly. The barber has law on his side, and yet  you have right on yours. The law must be obeyed, but--come here and let  me whisper something to you.    (The woodcutter listens smilingly and bowing low, leaves the room.)      ACT III      PLACE: The barber's shop.    TIME: A few days later.    ALI: Ah! here comes my stupid friend the woodcutter. I suppose he has  come to quarrel about the wood. No, he is smiling.    WOODCUTTER: Good day to you, friend Ali. I have come to ask if you will  be so kind as to shave me and a companion from the country.    ALI: Oh, yes, I suppose so.    WOODCUTTER: How much will you charge?    ALI: A shekel for the two.    (To himself.)    The poor fool cannot pay that sum.    WOODCUTTER. Very good. Shave me first.    (Ali shaves him.)    ALI: Now you are shaved. Where is your companion?    WOODCUTTER: He is standing outside. He will come in at once.    (He goes out and returns leading his donkey.)    This is my companion. Shave him.    ALI (_in a rage_): Shave him! Shave a donkey, indeed! Is it not enough  that I should lower myself by touching you? And then you insult me by  asking me to shave your donkey! Away with you!      ACT IV      PLACE: Caliph's Palace.    TIME: Half-hour later.    CALIPH: Well, my friend, did you do as I told you?    WOODCUTTER: Yes, and Ali refused to shave my donkey.    CALIPH (_to Courtier_): Bid Ali come to me at once and bring his razors  with him.    (Courtier leaves and returns with Ali.)    CALIPH: Why did you refuse to shave this man's companion? Was not that  your agreement?    ALI (_kissing the ground_): It is true, O caliph, such was the  agreement, but who ever made a companion of a donkey before?    CALIPH: True enough, but who ever thought of saying that a pack saddle  is a part of a load of wood? No, no, it is the woodcutter's turn now.  Shave his donkey instantly.    (Ali lathers the beast and shaves him in the presence of the whole  court, and then slips away amid the laughter of the bystanders.)    CALIPH: Now, my honest woodcutter, here is a purse of gold for you.  Always remember that the caliph gladly listens to the complaints of his  people, poor and rich, and will right their wrongs if he can.    WOODCUTTER: Long live the Caliph!    COURTIERS: Long live the Caliph!    --EASTERN TALE.          WINTER NIGHT          Blow, wind, blow!      Drift the flying snow!    Send it twirling, twirling overhead.      There's a bedroom in a tree      Where snug as snug can be,    The squirrel nests in his cozy bed.        Shriek, wind, shriek!      Make the branches creak!    Battle with the boughs till break of day!      In a snow cave warm and tight      Through the icy winter night    The rabbit sleeps the peaceful hour away.        Scold, wind, scold!      So bitter and so bold!    Shake the windows with your tap, tap, tap!      With half-shut, dreamy eyes      The drowsy baby lies    Cuddled closely in his mother's lap.    --MARY F. BUTTS.          HOPE'S DOLL      It was Saturday morning. Elizabeth Brown sat by a window in the big  kitchen making a pink dress for little Hope's doll.    On the chair beside her lay the doll, though you might not have thought  of calling it one. It did not have curly hair--nor eyes that open and  shut. In those days no child had toys like ours. Hope's doll was made of  a corncob; the face was painted on a piece of linen stretched over a  ball of wool on the end of the cob.    Little Hope was taking her morning nap. When Elizabeth had sewed the  last neat stitches, she dressed the doll and laid it on the bed by the  little girl. How happy Hope was when she awoke and saw it! She thought  it the most beautiful doll in the world.    \"What will you call your doll, Hope?\" asked Elizabeth.    \"I will name her for mother,\" said Hope. \"I will call her Mary Ellen.\"    [Illustration: Hope and her doll]    Hope played all the afternoon with her doll and was very happy. When the  sunset gun sounded, she had to stop playing. With the Puritans, the  Sabbath began at sunset, and no child could play after the gun was  heard.    The little maid kissed her baby and went into the bedroom to find a warm  place for it to stay until the next evening. There lay father's Sunday  coat; what warmer nest could she find for Mary Ellen than its big  pocket?    After breakfast the next day, every one got ready to go to meeting.  Master Brown filled the little tin foot stove with hot coals from the  hearth; then he took his gun from its hook. In those days no man went  anywhere without his gun--not even to church, for the Indians were  likely to come at any time.    Sometimes the firing of a gun was the call to worship. More often a big  drum, beaten on the steps of the meeting house, told the people it was  time to come together.    At the sound of the drum, Master Brown and his wife, with Elizabeth and  Hope, started to church. From every house in the village came men,  women, and children. They were always ready when the drum began to beat,  for no one was ever late to meeting in those days.    Master Brown led his family to their pew and opened a little door to let  them in. The pew was very much like a large box with seats around the  sides.    The church was cold, for there was no fire. The children warmed their  fingers and toes by the queer little foot stove their father had brought  from home.    When every one was seated, the minister climbed the steps to his high  pulpit. The sermon was always very long--three hours at least. The  children could not understand what it was all about, and it was very  hard for them to sit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15173"],[0,"Pictures of Jewish Home-Life Fifty Years Ago (#9)"],[1,"  done there, as the food is generally brought cooked from the patients'  homes.    \"I once went to visit the Bikkur-Cholem. One patient I saw had a jug of  cold water brought to her, and, though her own lips were very parched,  she would not take even one sip, but had the water given to those near  her, who, in a very high state of fever, were clamouring for water.  Other patients I saw were cheerfully and willingly sharing their food  with those who had none. Until I had visited that Bikkur-Cholem I had  never realized what real charity meant. For these sufferers, in their  love and thoughtfulness and genuine self-sacrifice towards  fellow-sufferers less fortunate than themselves, were obeying in spirit  as well as in the letter the time-honoured commandment given us 'to love  one's neighbour as oneself.'    \"The arrangements in the Bikkur-Cholem are most insanitary;  disinfectants are unheard of; and I greatly pitied the poor unfortunates  that have to go there.\"    Mr. Jacob was too overcome by his feelings to continue--so for a few  minutes there was a deep silence. Then one of the listeners said: \"One  is thankful to remember that this letter was written fifty years ago,  and conditions must have improved since our writer first went to  Palestine.\"    \"Yes, thank God!\" replied kind-hearted Mr Jacob; and then he continued  reading the letter.    \"Most of the patients die; but a few get cured and leave. If they do, it  is certainly more through faith in God's love and mercy than through the  remedies they receive while there.    \"Now, I want to tell you of a voluntary service which respectable,  well-to-do men and women, and even scholars, do, for the poor who die.  These kind folk are called 'the Chevra Kadisha.' No doubt because of the  heat, there is a strict law that no one who dies in Palestine is allowed  to remain unburied long; and it is believed here that the dead continue  to suffer until they are entombed. So the custom is to bury within  twelve hours every one who dies. The Chevra Kadisha look upon such a  deed as a Mitzvoth. If a poor woman dies, one of these kind women at  once goes to wash the corpse and lay it out ready to be put on the  bier--then when all the relatives and friends of the deceased have given  vent to their sorrow by weeping, some men and some scholars belonging to  the Chevra Kadisha voluntarily carry the bier on their shoulders to the  place of burial (which I think is the Mount of Olives), while others dig  the grave and a scholar or two read the Prayers over the Dead.    \"By the Chevra Kadisha beggars and tramps are thus washed and buried  when dead, free of expense, by these good, self-sacrificing people, at  all times and in all weathers, as a sign that in death all are equal.  The people who can afford it leave enough money to pay all their own  burial expenses or these are paid for by their relatives.    \"Acts of charity towards very poor girls who have no dowry or suitable  wedding-clothes are very touching and generous. It is considered a  disgrace to the community if a poor girl is not given the opportunity to  marry, and a community not only provides a dower, but also seeks for a  bridegroom for her. The housewives willingly and generously prepare the  wedding-feast, for everyone is willing to give something from their  store-room. No shame is attached to poor girls accepting such help; for  it is considered a duty by all our brethren to provide what is necessary  for a bride who has not the means to get things for herself.    \"I am sorry that I cannot write more by this mail.\"    One listener interrupted, saying: \"Most of what you have read Mr Jacob  happens in Russia and in other parts of the world where Jews live in  ghettos.\"    \"Quite true,\" said Mr Jacob, \"for wherever Jews live together they keep  up old customs, and all old customs are more or less alike in all  ghettos. It is only when we Jews live outside the ghettos, under  different surroundings, that we are tempted to throw over many religious  customs. The unfortunate thing is, that we are too often inclined to  throw off the really good customs rather than the useless ones, and more  inclined to adopt the bad traits and customs of our neighbours rather  than the good ones amongst whom we live, be it in England, France,  Germany, India, or elsewhere. This is a bad habit, and we must do our  utmost in the future to guard against it; for, if we all made an effort  to retain our own ancient customs that are really good and beneficial to  ourselves and others and adopt only the good and healthy customs of our  neighbours, then, indeed, we might feel we had a right to call ourselves  and be recognized by those we live amongst as 'God's Chosen People.'\"            FATHER FROST IN JERUSALEM      The next Friday evening Mr Jacob read the following letter.    \"My Dear Cousin Mill,--I have not yet written to tell you how we manage  during cold weather. Before we arrived, we were under the impression  that it was always warm in Palestine. Certainly the sun does shine more  in winter here than in England, and while it shines the weather is very  pleasant; but we get very cold weather, too, especially in Jerusalem. We  get very little snow, but a good deal of frost, which no one enjoys. No  doubt you wonder why, because we all enjoyed the cold and frost in  England, and loved the skating and the snowballing.    \"The reason is very clear, for here we have no cheery open fireplaces,  which give out so much heat in England; in fact there are not even any  steel or iron ovens, and the result is, the Palestinian houses are  intensely cold in frosty weather. The ceilings are all lofty and in the  shape of a dome, which, with the very thick stone walls is very pleasant  in summer but very cold in the winter. Then there is very little  firewood to be had here, as the Turks try to prevent much  tree-planting, so fire wood is a luxury which very few can afford.  Instead, we have all copper buckets pierced with holes standing on a  tripod and filled with burning charcoal, which is placed in the middle  of the room.    \"How we all eagerly cluster round it and watch the red hot charcoal,  hoping that by _looking at it_ the warmth will go into our bodies! Such  a small amount of charcoal as we can afford does not warm a room very  much, so all the windows are closed tightly to prevent any cold air  coming in. This also prevents the fumes of the burning charcoal from  escaping, so naturally the air gets very stuffy, and many suffer from  headaches or fall into a heavy sleep.    \"You will wonder why it is many people do not get frozen. Well, the old  proverb holds good here, that 'Necessity is the mother of invention,' so  even in the coldest weather we have a remedy; for we heat also our brass  samovar, which holds about thirty glasses of tea, and we drink a glass  of hot tea every now and then.    \"As the samovar boils all day the steam also sends out some warmth into  the room.    \"Then, again, the younger children are during the very cold weather kept  warm in bed with feather coverlets and pillows, which the elder people  try to keep warm in doing the necessary household duties. Very few go  out in the streets, except the men when they go to Shule, and the elder  boys when they go to the Yeshiba or Cheder, and even they are very often  kept at home.    \"One comfort is that 'Father Frost' does not stay long, so we can manage  to bear his icy breath: the greatest hardship is when he visits us on a  Sabbath, for of course on that day we cannot heat the samovar and so we  have to do with less tea.    \"We prepare our Sabbath meals in a small scullery, or porch, in which a  small brick oven is built to keep the food hot for the Sabbath. A few  pieces of wood are put in, and, when well lighted, the oven is  half-filled with charcoal-dust--this again is covered by pieces of tin  or lime, and, on top of all, the saucepans are put containing food for  the Sabbath meals: also bottles or jars of water are thus kept hot for  tea or coffee. Neighbours who are not lucky enough to have such an oven  bring in their food, and we let them put it in our ovens. In this way we  have enough for every one to drink who may come in. Sometimes twenty  poor people come in on a Sabbath day and say: 'Spare me, please, a  little hot water?' No one would think of refusing to give them some,  even if they had to share their last glass with them.    \"Generally on cold Sabbath afternoons our parents have a nap after  eating the nice hot cholent, and we girls and the young married women  go and spend a few hours with our old lady friend, who always entertains  us with stories and discussions on various interesting subjects. So the  time passes very quickly and so pleasantly that we forget how cold it  is. About twenty or thirty of us all sit close together on her divan  covered up with rugs, and this with the excitement over the tales she  tells us, helps to keep us warm.    \"Last Sabbath our old lady was not very well, and we were feeling very  miserable without her entertaining tales. Suddenly, one of my  girl-friends asked me to tell them about our life in London.    \"As they had never read or heard about life outside Jerusalem, it was  most amusing to hear their exclamations of wonder; for they could hardly  believe what I told them was true, till our old lady confirmed our  statements.    \"First, they wanted to know how young men and women behaved toward each  other.    \"I told them that every man and every woman, whether young or old,  either in the street or in-doors, always shook hands with friends--at  this they looked very surprised and some seemed even horrified,  exclaiming: 'What a sin to commit.' I asked them where it was written  that this was a sin? 'Well,' some replied, 'our parents or husbands say  it is a sin,' 'I don't think it is a sin, but only a custom,' said I.  'But it _is_ a sin,' insisted one little wife of fifteen 'to touch one "]]]
