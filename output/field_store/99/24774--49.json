The cows are pretty miserably  off for pasture, the banks and pathways of the dykes being their only  grazing ground, which the sheep perambulate also, in earnest search of a  nibble of fresh herbage; both the cows and sheep are fed with rice flour  in great abundance, and are pretty often carried down for change of air  and more sufficient grazing to Hampton, Mr. ----'s estate, on the island  of St. Simons, fifteen miles from this place, further down the river--or  rather, indeed, I should say in the sea, for 'tis salt water all round,  and one end of the island has a noble beach open to the vast Atlantic. The  pigs thrive admirably here, and attain very great perfection of size and  flavour; the rice flour, upon which they are chiefly fed, tending to make  them very delicate. As for the poultry, it being one of the few privileges  of the poor blacks to raise as many as they can, their abundance is  literally a nuisance--ducks, fowls, pigeons, turkeys (the two latter  species, by the bye, are exclusively the master's property), cluck,  scream, gabble, gobble, crow, cackle, fight, fly, and flutter in all  directions, and to their immense concourse, and the perfect freedom with  which they intrude themselves even into the piazza of the house, the  pantry, and kitchen, I partly attribute the swarms of fleas, and other  still less agreeable vermin, with which we are most horribly pestered.    My walk lay to-day along the bank of a canal, which has been dug through  nearly the whole length of the island, to render more direct and easy the  transportation of the rice from one end of the estate to another, or from  the various distant fields to the principal mill at Settlement No. 1. It  is of considerable width and depth, and opens by various locks into the  river. It has, unfortunately, no trees on its banks, but a good footpath  renders it, in spite of that deficiency, about the best walk on the  island. I passed again to-day one of those beautiful evergreen thickets,  which I described to you in my last letter; it is called a reserve, and is  kept uncleared and uncultivated in its natural swampy condition, to allow  of the people's procuring their firewood from it. I cannot get accustomed,  so as to be indifferent to this exquisite natural ornamental growth, and  think, as I contemplate the various and beautiful foliage of these watery  woods, how many of our finest English parks and gardens owe their chiefest  adornments to plantations of these shrubs, procured at immense cost,  reared with infinite pains and care, which are here basking in the  winter's sunshine, waiting to be cut down for firewood! These little  groves are peopled with wild pigeons and birds, which they designate here  as blackbirds. These sometimes rise from the rice fields with a whirr of  multitudinous wings, that is almost startling, and positively overshadow  the ground beneath like a cloud.    I had a conversation that interested me a good deal, during my walk  to-day, with my peculiar slave Jack. This lad, whom Mr. ---- has appointed  to attend me in my roamings about the island, and rowing expeditions on  the river, is the son of the last head driver, a man of very extraordinary  intelligence and faithfulness--such, at least, is the account given of him  by his employers (in the burial-ground of the negroes is a stone dedicated  to his memory, a mark of distinction accorded by his masters, which his  son never failed to point out to me, when we passed that way). Jack  appears to inherit his quickness of apprehension; his questions, like  those of an intelligent child, are absolutely inexhaustible; his curiosity  about all things beyond this island, the prison-house of his existence,  is perfectly intense; his countenance is very pleasing, mild, and not  otherwise than thoughtful; he is, in common with the rest of them, a  stupendous flatterer, and, like the rest of them, also seems devoid of  physical and moral courage. To-day, in the midst of his torrent of  enquiries about places and things, I suddenly asked him if he would like  to be free. A gleam of light absolutely shot over his whole countenance,  like the vivid and instantaneous lightning--he stammered, hesitated,  became excessively confused, and at length replied--'Free, missis? what  for me wish to be free? Oh! no, missis, me no wish to be free, if massa  only let we keep pig.' The fear of offending, by uttering that forbidden  wish--the dread of admitting, by its expression, the slightest discontent  with his present situation--the desire to conciliate my favour, even at  the expense of strangling the intense natural longing that absolutely  glowed in his every feature--it was a sad spectacle, and I repented my  question. As for the pitiful request which he reiterated several times  adding, 'No, missis, me no want to be free--me work till me die for missis  and massa,' with increased emphasis; it amounted only to this, that the  negroes once were, but no longer are, permitted to keep pigs. The increase  of filth and foul smells, consequent upon their being raised, is, of  course, very great; and, moreover, Mr. ---- told me, when I preferred poor  Jack's request to him, that their allowance was no more than would suffice  their own necessity, and that they had not the means of feeding the  animals. With a little good management they might very easily obtain them,  however; their little 'kail-yard' alone would suffice to it, and the pork  and bacon would prove a most welcome addition to their farinaceous diet.  You perceive at once (or if you could have seen the boy's face, you would  have perceived at once), that his situation was no mystery to him, that  his value to Mr. ----, and, as he supposed, to me, was perfectly well  known to him, and that he comprehended immediately that his expressing  even the desire to be free, might be construed by me into an offence, and  sought by eager protestations of his delighted acquiescence in slavery, to  conceal his soul's natural yearning, lest I should resent it. 'T was a sad  passage between us, and sent me home full of the most painful thoughts. I  told Mr. ----, with much indignation, of poor Harriet's flogging, and  represented that if the people were to be chastised for anything they said  to me, I must leave the place, as I could not but hear their complaints,  and endeavour, by all my miserable limited means, to better their  condition while I was here. He said he would ask Mr. O---- about it,  assuring me, at the same time, that it was impossible to believe a single  word any of these people said. At dinner, accordingly, the enquiry was  made as to the cause of her punishment, and Mr. O---- then said it was not  at all for what she had told me, that he had flogged her, but for having  answered him impertinently, that he had ordered her into the field,  whereupon she had said she was ill and could not work, that he retorted he  knew better, and bade her get up and go to work; she replied, 'Very well,  I'll go, but I shall just come back again!' meaning, that when in the  field, she would be unable to work, and obliged, to return to the  hospital. 'For this reply,' Mr. O---- said, 'I gave her a good lashing; it  was her business to have gone into the field without answering me, and  then we should have soon seen whether she could work or not; I gave it to  Chloe too, for some such impudence.' I give you the words of the  conversation, which was prolonged to a great length, the overseer  complaining of sham sicknesses of the slaves, and detailing the most  disgusting struggle which is going on the whole time, on the one hand to  inflict, and on the other, to evade oppression and injustice. With this  sauce I ate my dinner, and truly it tasted bitter.    Towards sunset I went on the river to take my rowing lesson. A darling  little canoe which carries two oars and a steersman, and rejoices in the  appropriate title of the 'Dolphin,' is my especial vessel; and with Jack's  help and instructions, I contrived this evening to row upwards of half a  mile, coasting the reed-crowned edge of the island to another very large  rice mill, the enormous wheel of which is turned by the tide. A small bank  of mud and sand covered with reedy coarse grass divides the river into two  arms on this side of the island; the deep channel is on the outside of  this bank, and as we rowed home this evening, the tide having fallen, we  scraped sand almost the whole way. Mr. ----'s domain, it seems to me, will  presently fill up this shallow stream, and join itself to the  above-mentioned mud-bank. The whole course of this most noble river is  full of shoals, banks, mud, and sand-bars, and the navigation, which is  difficult to those who know it well, is utterly baffling to the  inexperienced. The fact is, that the two elements are so fused hereabouts,  that there are hardly such things as earth or water proper; that which  styles itself the former, is a fat, muddy, slimy sponge, that, floating  half under the turbid river, looks yet saturated with the thick waves  which every now and then reclaim their late dominion, and cover it almost  entirely; the water, again, cloudy and yellow, like pea-soup, seems but a  solution of such islands, rolling turbid and thick with alluvium, which it  both gathers and deposits as it sweeps along with a swollen, smooth  rapidity, that almost deceives the eye. Amphibious creatures, alligators,  serpents, and wild fowl, haunt these yet but half-formed regions, where  land and water are of the consistency of hasty-pudding--the one seeming  too unstable to walk on, the other almost too thick to float in. But then,  the sky, if no human chisel ever yet cut breath, neither did any human pen  ever write light; if it did, mine should spread out before you the  unspeakable glories of these southern heavens, the saffron brightness of  morning, the blue intense brilliancy of noon, the golden splendour and the  rosy softness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12423"],[0,"A Short History of the United States for School Use (#9)"],[1,"  disputes with one another, so they asked Queen Anne to take charge of  the government of the province. This she did by telling the governor of  New York to govern New Jersey also. This was not what the Jersey people  had expected. But they had their own legislature. In time also they  secured a governor all to themselves and became a royal province  entirely separate from New York. Pennsylvania and New York protected the  Jersey people from the French and the Indians, and provided markets for  the products of the Jersey farms. The colonists were industrious and  their soil was fertile. They were very religious and paid great  attention to education. New Jersey became very prosperous and so  continued until the Revolution.    [Sidenote: Founding of Carolina, 1663. _Higginson_, 124-127.]    73. The Founding of Carolina.--The planting of New Jersey was not  the only colonial venture of Carteret and Berkeley. With Lord Chancellor  Clarendon and other noblemen they obtained from Charles land in southern  Virginia extending southward into Spanish Florida. This great territory  was named Carolina.    [Sidenote: Northern Carolina.]    [Sidenote: Southern Carolina.]    74. The Carolina Colonists.--In 1663, when the Carolina charter was  granted, there were a few settlers living in the northern part of the  colony. Other colonists came from outside mainly from the Barbadoes and  settled on the Cape Fear River. In this way was formed a colony in  northern Carolina. But the most important settlement was in the southern  part of the province at Charleston. Southern Carolina at once became  prosperous. This was due to the fact that the soil and climate of that  region were well suited to the cultivation of rice. The rice swamps  brought riches to the planters, they also compelled the employment of  large numbers of negro slaves. Before long, indeed, there were more  negroes than whites in southern Carolina. In this way there grew up two  distinct centers of colonial life in the province.    [Illustration: Southern Carolina.]    [Sidenote: Indian war.]    [Sidenote: Bacon's Rebellion, 1676.]    75. Bacon's Rebellion, 1676.--By this time the Virginians had  become very discontented. There had been no election to the colonial  assembly since 1660 and Governor Berkeley was very tyrannical. The  Virginians also wanted more churches and more schools. To add to these  causes of discontent the Indians now attacked the settlers, and Berkeley  seemed to take very little interest in protecting the Virginians. Led by  Nathaniel Bacon the colonists marched to Jamestown and demanded  authority to go against the Indians. Berkeley gave Bacon a commission.  But, as soon as Bacon left Jamestown on his expedition, Berkeley  declared that he was a rebel. Bacon returned, and Berkeley fled. Bacon  marched against the Indians again, and Berkeley came back, and so the  rebellion went on until Bacon died. Berkeley then captured the other  leaders one after another and hanged them. But when he returned to  England, Charles II turned his back to him, saying, \"The old fool has  killed more men in Virginia than I for the murder of my father.\"    [Illustration: THE HOUSE IN WHICH NATHANIEL BACON DIED. From an original  sketch.]    [Sidenote: Greedy Governors.]    [Sidenote: Founding of William and Mary College, 1691.]    76. Virginia after Bacon's Rebellion.--The Virginians were now  handed over to a set of greedy governors. Some of them came to America  to make their fortunes. But some of them were governors whom the people  of other colonies would not have. The only event of importance in the  history of the colony during the next twenty-five years was the founding  of William and Mary College (1691) at Williamsburg. It was the second  oldest college in the English colonies.    [Illustration: THE OPENING LINES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA CHARTER SHOWING  ORNAMENTAL BORDER AND PORTRAIT OF CHARLES II.]    [Sidenote: King Philip's War, 1675-76. _Higginson_, 137-138;  _Eggleston_, 81-89.]    77. King Philip's War, 1675-76.--It was not only in Virginia and  Maryland that the Indians were restless at this time. In New England  also they attacked the whites. They were led by Massasoit's son, King  Philip, an able and far-seeing man. He saw with dismay how rapidly the  whites were driving the Indians away from their hunting-grounds. The  Indians burned the English villages on the frontier and killed hundreds  of the settlers. The strongest chief to join Philip was Canonchet of  the Narragansetts. The colonial soldiers stormed his fort and killed a  thousand Indian warriors. Before long King Philip himself was killed,  and the war slowly came to an end.    [Sidenote: William Penn.]    [Sidenote: The Pennsylvania Charter, 1681.]    78. William Penn.--Among the greatest Englishmen of that time was  William Penn. He was a Quaker and was also a friend of Charles II and  James, Duke of York. He wished to found a colony in which he and the  Quakers could work out their ideas in religious and civil matters. It  chanced that Charles owed Penn a large sum of money. As Charles seldom  had any money, he was very glad to give Penn instead a large tract of  land in America. In this way Penn obtained Pennsylvania. James, for his  part, gave him Delaware.    [Sidenote: Settlement of Pennsylvania, 1682. _Higginson_, 101-105;  _Eggleston_, 57-60; _Source-Book_, 67-69.]    79. Founding of Pennsylvania, 1682.--William Penn had a great  reputation for honesty and fair dealing among the English Quakers and  among the Quakers on the continent of Europe as well. As soon as it was  known that he was to found a colony, great numbers of persons came to  Pennsylvania from England and from Germany. In a very short time the  colony became strong and prosperous. In the first place, the soil of  Pennsylvania was rich and productive while its climate was well suited  to the growth of grain. In the second place, Penn was very liberal to  his colonists. He gave them a large share in the government of the  province and he allowed no religious persecution. He also insisted on  fair and honest dealing with the Indians.    [Sidenote: Mason and Dixon's line.]    [Sidenote: Its importance in history.]    80. Mason and Dixon's Line.--In the seventeenth century the  geography of America was very little understood in Europe--and the  persons who drew up colonial charters understood it least of all.  Charter lines frequently overlapped and were often very indistinct. This  was particularly true of the Maryland and Pennsylvania boundaries. Penn  and Baltimore tried to come to an agreement; but they never could agree.  Years afterward, when they were both dead, their heirs agreed to have a  line drawn without much regard to the charters. This line was finally  surveyed by two English engineers, Mason and Dixon, and is always  called after their names. It is the present boundary line between  Pennsylvania and Maryland. In colonial days it separated the colonies  where slavery was the rule from those where labor was generally free. In  the first half of the nineteenth century it separated the free states  from the slave states. Mason and Dixon's line, therefore, has been a  famous line in the history of the United States.          CHAPTER 9    COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT, 1688-1760    [Sidenote: New policy of the Stuarts.]    [Sidenote: Reasons for the new policy.]    81. The Stuart Tyranny.--Instead of admiring the growth of the  colonies in strength and in liberty, Charles and James saw it with  dismay. The colonies were becoming too strong and too free. They  determined to reduce all the colonies to royal provinces, like  Virginia--with the exception of Pennsylvania which belonged to their  friend, William Penn. There was a good deal to be said in favor of this  plan, for the colonists were so jealous of each other that they would  not unite against the French or the Indians. If the governments were all  in the hands of the king, the whole strength of the British colonies  could be used against any enemy of England.    [Sidenote: End of the Massachusetts Company, 1684.]    [Sidenote: Governor Andros of New England, 1688.]    82. The Stuart Tyranny in New England.--The Massachusetts charter  was now taken away, and Sir Edmund Andros was sent over to govern the  colony. He was ordered to make laws and to tax the people without asking  their consent. He did as he was ordered to do. He set up the Church of  England. He taxed the people. He even took their lands from them, on the  ground that the grants from the old Massachusetts government were of no  value. When one man pointed to the magistrates' signatures to his grant,  Andros told him that their names were worth no more than a scratch with  a bear's paw. He also enforced the navigation laws and took possession  of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Plymouth. At the same time he was  also governor of New Hampshire and of New York.

The \"Glorious Revolution\" in America, 1689.--By this time  Charles was dead, and James was King of England. The English people did  not like James any better than the New Englanders liked Andros. In 1688  they rebelled and made William of Orange and his wife Mary, James's  eldest daughter, King and Queen of England. On their part, the  Massachusetts colonists seized Andros and his followers and shut them up  in prison (April 18, 1689). The people of Connecticut and Rhode Island  turned out Andros's agents and set up their old governments. In New  York also Andros's deputy governor was expelled, and the people took  control of affairs until the king and queen should send out a governor.  Indeed, all the colonies, except Maryland, declared for William  and Mary.    [Sidenote: Policy of William and Mary.]    [Sidenote: The Massachusetts"]]]
