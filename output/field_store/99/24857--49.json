He hed a rope an' he got to chasin' some  hosses over thar. One was Pronto, an' the son-of-a-gun somehow did git  the noose over Pronto's head. But he couldn't hold it, or didn't want  to, fer Pronto broke loose an' jumped the fence. This wasn't so bad as  far as it went. But one of them bad steers got after Pronto. He run an'  sure stepped on the rope, an' fell. The big steer nearly piled on him.  Pronto broke some records then. He shore was scared. Howsoever he picked  out rough ground an' run plumb into some dead brush. Reckon thar he got  cut up. We was all a good ways off. The steer went bawlin' an' plungin'  after Pronto. Wils yelled fer a rifle, but nobody hed one. Nor a  six-shooter, either.... I'm goin' back to packin' a gun. Wal, Wils did  some ridin' to git over thar in time to save Pronto.\"    \"Lem, that is not all,\" said Columbine, earnestly, as the cowboy  concluded. Her knowledge of the range told her that Lem had narrated  nothing so far which could have been cause for his cold, grim, evasive  manner; and her woman's intuition divined a catastrophe.    \"Nope.... Wils's hoss fell on him.\"    Lem broke that final news with all a cowboy's bluntness.    \"Was he hurt--_Lem_!\" cried Columbine.    \"Say, Miss Collie,\" remonstrated Lem, \"we're doctorin' up your hoss. You  needn't drop everythin' an' grab me like thet. An' you're white as a  sheet, too. It ain't nuthin' much fer a cowboy to hev a hoss fall  on him.\"    \"Lem Billings, I'll hate you if you don't tell me quick,\" flashed  Columbine, fiercely.    \"Ahuh! So thet's how the land lays,\" replied Lem, shrewdly. \"Wal, I'm  sorry to tell you thet Wils was bad hurt. Now, not _real_ bad!... The  hoss fell on his leg an' broke it. I cut off his boot. His foot was all  smashed. But thar wasn't any other hurt--honest! They're takin' him to  Kremmlin'.\"    \"Ah!\" Columbine's low cry sounded strangely in her ears, as if some one  else had uttered it.    \"Buster Jack made two bursts this hyar day,\" concluded Lem,  reflectively. \"Miss Collie, I ain't shore how you're regardin' thet  individool, but I'm tellin' you this, fer your own good. He's bad  medicine. He has his old man's temper thet riles up at nuthin' an' never  felt a halter. Wusser'n thet, he's spoiled an' he acts like a colt  thet'd tasted loco. The idee of his ropin' Pronto right thar near the  round-up! Any one would think he jest come West. Old Bill is no fool.  But he wears blinders when he looks at his son. I'm predictin' bad days  fer White Slides Ranch.\"        CHAPTER IV    Only one man at Meeker appeared to be attracted by the news that Rancher  Bill Belllounds was offering employment. This was a little  cadaverous-looking fellow, apparently neither young nor old, who said  his name was Bent Wade. He had drifted into Meeker with two poor horses  and a pack.    \"Whar you from?\" asked the innkeeper, observing how Wade cared for his  horses before he thought of himself. The query had to be repeated.    \"Cripple Creek. I was cook for some miners an' I panned gold between  times,\" was the reply.    \"Humph! Thet oughter been a better-payin' job than any to be hed  hereabouts.\"    \"Yes, got big pay there,\" said Wade, with a sigh.    \"What'd you leave fer?\"    \"We hed a fight over the diggin's an' I was the only one left. I'll tell  you....\" Whereupon Wade sat down on a box, removed his old sombrero, and  began to talk. An idler sauntered over, attracted by something. Then a  miner happened by to halt and join the group.    Next, old Kemp, the patriarch of the village, came and listened  attentively. Wade seemed to have a strange magnetism, a magic tongue.    He was small of stature, but wiry and muscular. His garments were old,  soiled, worn. When he removed the wide-brimmed sombrero he exposed a  remarkable face. It was smooth except for a drooping mustache, and  pallid, with drops of sweat standing out on the high, broad forehead;  gaunt and hollow-cheeked, with an enormous nose, and cavernous eyes set  deep under shaggy brows. These features, however, were not so striking  in themselves. Long, sloping, almost invisible lines of pain, the shadow  of mystery and gloom in the deep-set, dark eyes, a sad harmony between  features and expression, these marked the man's face with a record no  keen eye could miss.    Wade told a terrible tale of gold and blood and death. It seemed to  relieve him. His face changed, and lost what might have been called its  tragic light, its driven intensity.    His listeners shook their heads in awe. Hard tales were common in  Colorado, but this one was exceptional. Two of the group left without  comment. Old Kemp stared with narrow, half-recognizing eyes at the  new-comer.    \"Wal! Wal!\" ejaculated the innkeeper. \"It do beat hell what can  happen!... Stranger, will you put up your hosses an' stay?\"    \"I'm lookin' for work,\" replied Wade.    It was then that mention was made of Belllounds sending to Meeker for  hands.    \"Old Bill Belllounds thet settled Middle Park an' made friends with the  Utes,\" said Wade, as if certain of his facts.    \"Yep, you have Bill to rights. Do you know him?\"    \"I seen him once twenty years ago.\"    \"Ever been to Middle Park? Belllounds owns ranches there,\" said the  innkeeper.    \"He ain't livin' in the Park now,\" interposed Kemp. \"He's at White  Slides, I reckon, these last eight or ten years. Thet's over the  Gore Range.\"    \"Prospected all through that country,\" said Wade.    \"Wal, it's a fine part of Colorado. Hay an' stock country--too high fer  grain. Did you mean you'd been through the Park?\"    \"Once--long ago,\" replied Wade, staring with his great, cavernous eyes  into space. Some memory of Middle Park haunted him.    \"Wal, then, I won't be steerin' you wrong,\" said the innkeeper. \"I like  thet country. Some people don't. An' I say if you can cook or pack or  punch cows or 'most anythin' you'll find a bunk with Old Bill. I  understand he was needin' a hunter most of all. Lions an' wolves bad!  Can you hunt?\"    \"Hey?\" queried Wade, absently, as he inclined his ear. \"I'm deaf on one  side.\"    \"Are you a good man with dogs an' guns?\" shouted his questioner.    \"Tolerable,\" replied Wade.    \"Then you're sure of a job.\"    \"I'll go. Much obliged to you.\"    \"Not a-tall. I'm doin' Belllounds a favor. Reckon you'll put up here  to-night?\"    \"I always sleep out. But I'll buy feed an' supplies,\" replied Wade, as  he turned to his horses.    Old Kemp trudged down the road, wagging his gray head as if he was  contending with a memory sadly failing him. An hour later when Bent Wade  rode out of town he passed Kemp, and hailed him. The old-timer suddenly  slapped his leg: \"By Golly! I knowed I'd met him before!\"    Later, he said with a show of gossipy excitement to his friend the  innkeeper, \"Thet fellar was Bent Wade!\"    \"So he told me,\" returned the other.    \"But didn't you never hear of him? _Bent Wade?_\"    \"Now you tax me, thet name do 'pear familiar. But dash take it, I can't  remember. I knowed he was somebody, though. Hope I didn't wish a  gun-fighter or outlaw on Old Bill. Who was he, anyhow?\"    \"They call him Hell-Bent Wade. I seen him in Wyomin', whar he were a  stage-driver. But I never heerd who he was an' what he was till years  after. Thet was onct I dropped down into Boulder. Wade was thar, all  shot up, bein' nussed by Sam Coles. Sam's dead now. He was a friend of  Wade's an' knowed him fer long. Wal, I heerd all thet anybody ever heerd  about him, I reckon. Accordin' to Coles this hyar Hell-Bent Wade was a  strange, wonderful sort of fellar. He had the most amazin' ways. He  could do anythin' under the sun better'n any one else. Bad with guns!  He never stayed in one place fer long. He never hunted trouble, but  trouble follered him. As I remember Coles, thet was Wade's queer  idee--he couldn't shake trouble. No matter whar he went, always thar was  hell. Thet's what gave him the name Hell-Bent.... An' Coles swore thet  Wade was the whitest man he ever knew. Heart of gold, he said. Always  savin' somebody, helpin' somebody, givin' his money or time--never  thinkin' of himself a-tall.... When he began to tell thet story about  Cripple Creek then my ole head begun to ache with rememberin'. Fer I'd  heerd Bent Wade talk before. Jest the same kind of story he told hyar,  only wuss. Lordy! but thet fellar has seen times. An' queerest of all is  thet idee he has how hell's on his trail an' everywhere he roams it  ketches up with him, an' thar he meets the man who's got to hear  his tale!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Sunset found Bent Wade far up the valley of White River under the shadow  of the Flat Top Mountains. It was beautiful country. Grassy hills, with  colored aspen groves, swelled up on his left, and across the brawling  stream rose a league-long slope of black spruce, above which the bare  red-and-gray walls of the range towered, glorious with the blaze of  sinking sun. White patches of snow showed in the sheltered nooks. Wade's  gaze rested longest on the colored heights.    By and by the narrow valley opened into a park, at the upper end of  which stood a log cabin. A few cattle and horses grazed in an inclosed  pasture. The trail led by the cabin. As Wade rode up a bushy-haired man  came out of the door, rifle in hand. He might have been going out to  hunt, but his scrutiny of Wade was that of a lone settler in a  wild land.    \"Howdy, stranger!\" he said.    \"Good evenin',\" replied Wade. \"Reckon you're Blair an' I'm nigh the  headwaters of this river?\"    \"Yep, a matter of three miles to Trapper's Lake.\"    \"My name's Wade. I'm packin' over to take a job with Bill Belllounds.\"    \"Git down an' come in,\" returned Blair. \"Bill's man stopped with me some  time ago.\"    \"Obliged, I'm sure, but I'll be goin' on,\" responded Wade. \"Do you  happen to have a hunk of deer meat? Game powerful scarce comin' up  this valley.\"    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#9)"],[1,"over their brethren the  ministers, from the superiority of the apostles over presbyters.          CHAPTER V.    _Of a Divine Right by Divine Approbation._      III. By divine approbation of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in his word.  Whatsoever in matters of religion hath the divine approbation of the  Spirit of Christ in the Scriptures, that is of divine right, and by the  will and appointment of Jesus Christ. God's approving or allowing of any  thing, plainly implies that it is according to his will and pleasure,  and so is equivalent to a divine institution or appointment; for what is  a divine institution or law but the publishing of the divine will of the  legislator, touching things to be acted or omitted? and God cannot  approve any thing that is against his will. Contrariwise, God's  disallowing of any thing, plainly implies that it is against his will,  and so of divine right prohibited, and unlawful. God allows or disallows  things not because they are good or evil; but things are, therefore,  good or evil, because he approves or disallows them.    Now God approves or disallows things divers ways:    1. By commending or discommending. God commended king Josiah for his  zeal and impartiality in completing of the reformation of religion, 1  Kings xiii. 25. This is a rule for all princes and magistrates how they  should reform. The angel of the church of Ephesus is commended, for not  bearing of those that were evil, for trying and detecting the false  apostles, and for hating the works of the Nicolaitans, Rev. ii. 2, 3, 6.  The angel of the church of Pergamus is praised, for holding fast  Christ's name, and not denying his faith in places of danger, and days  of deepest persecution, Rev. ii. 13: a rule for all pastors and  churches, how in all such cases they should carry themselves. God's  commendings are divine commandings. On the contrary, God dispraises  Ephesus, for falling from her first love, Rev. ii. 4. Pergamus, for  holding the doctrine of Balaam, and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,  Rev. ii. 14, 15. Thyatira, for tolerating the false prophetess Jezebel,  to teach and seduce his servants, &c., Rev. ii. 20. Laodicea, because  she was neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm, Rev. iii. 15. The church of  Corinth, for coming together in public assemblies, not for better but  for worse, by reason of schisms, scandals, and other disorders about the  Lord's supper, 1 Cor. xi. 17, &c. In these and all such divine  discommendings of the churches for their corruptions, all succeeding  churches are strongly forbidden the like corruptions: God's dispraises  are divine prohibitions. Thus good church elders are commended in this  notion, that they are _elders ruling well_, 1 Tim. v. 17; therefore,  that elders in the church should rule, and rule well, is by this  commendation of divine right.    2. By promising and threatening. What promise did God ever make to any  act or performance, which was not a duty? or what threatening against  any act which was not a sin? He promises to them that forsake all for  Christ, a \"hundred-fold now in this time, and in the world to come  eternal life,\" Mark x. 29, 30; therefore it is our duty to forsake all  for Christ. He promised to ratify in heaven his disciples' sentences of  _building or loosing on earth_; and to _be with them_ whensoever _two or  three of them were met together_ for that end, Matt. xvi. 19, and xviii.  18-20, and John xx. 23. Therefore binding and loosing, remitting and  retaining of sins, and meeting together for that end, belong to them by  divine right. He promised to be with them that baptize, preach, remit,  and retain sins in his name, &c., _always, to the end of the world_,  John xx. 23; with Matt, xxviii. 18-20, which promise shows, that these  works and employments belong to all succeeding ministers to the world's  end, as well as to the apostles by divine right. On the contrary, the  Lord threatens Ephesus for decay of first love, Rev. ii. 4, 5; Pergamus,  for holding false doctrine, Rev. ii. 14, 15; Thyatira, for tolerating of  Jezebel and her false teaching, &c., Rev. ii. 21, 21, 23; and Laodicea,  for lukewarmness, Rev. iii. 15, 16. Therefore, all these were their  sins, and we are bound, even by this divine threatening, to avoid the  like by a divine warrant.    3. By remunerating or rewarding; whether he reward with blessings or  with judgments. With blessings God rewarded the Hebrew midwives, because  they preserved the male children of Israel, contrary to Pharaoh's bloody  command; _God made them houses_, Exod. i. 17, 20, 21. He will have the  elders that rule well _counted worthy of double honor_, &c.; i.e.  rewarded with a bountiful, plentiful maintenance, 1 Tim. v. 17.  Therefore, their ruling in the church is of divine right, for which God  appoints such a good reward. Contrariwise, with judgments God rewarded  king Saul, for offering a burnt-offering himself, 1 Sam. xiii. 12-14;  Uzzah, for touching the ark, though it was ready to fall, 2 Sam. vi. 6,  7; and king Uzziah, for going into the temple to burn incense, 2 Chron.  xxvi. 16. None of these being priests, yet presuming to meddle with the  priest's office. A rule for all persons, being not church officers, yea,  though they be princes or supreme magistrates, that they are hereby  warned by the divine law, not to usurp church authority or offices to  themselves. God rewarded the Corinthians with the judgments of  weakness, sickness, and death, for unworthy receiving of the Lord's  supper, 1 Cor. xi. 30. So that this is a divine warning for all after  churches against unworthy communicating.          CHAPTER VI.    IV. _Of a Divine Right by Divine Acts._      IV. By divine acts. Whatsoever matters of religion were erected in, or  conferred upon the Church of God, by God, or any person of the blessed  Trinity, and are left recorded in the Scripture, they are of divine  right, by the will and appointment of Jesus Christ. Shall divine  approbation, yea, shall the saints' binding example hold forth to us a  divine right, and shall not the divine actions of God, Christ, and the  Spirit, do it much more? Take some instances: the Lord's-day sabbath,  under the New Testament, was it not instituted (the seventh day being  changed to the first day of the week) by the acts of Christ, having now  perfected the spiritual creation of the new world? viz: by his  resurrection and apparitions to his disciples on that day, and  miraculous blessing and sanctifying of that day, by pouring forth the  gifts of the Holy Ghost, Acts ii., all which were seconded with the  apostolical practice in the primitive churches, Acts xx. 7, &c.; 1 Cor.  xvi. 1, 2. And do not the churches of Christ generally conclude upon  these grounds, that the Lord's-day sabbath is of divine warrant? Thus  circumcision is abrogated of divine right, by Christ's act, instituting  baptism instead thereof, Col. ii. 11, 12. The passover is abolished of  divine right, by Christ himself, our true passover, _being sacrificed  for us_, 1 Cor. v. 7; and the Lord's supper being instituted a memorial  of Christ's death instead of it, Matt, xxvi., Mark xiv., Luke xxii. And  the whole ceremonial law is antiquated and made void by Christ's death,  accomplishing all those dark types; therefore Christ, immediately before  his yielding up the ghost, cried, _It is finished_, John xix. 30. See  Col. ii. 14; Eph. ii. 14, 15; _abolishing the law of commandments in  ordinances_, Heb. viii. 13, and x. 4, 5, &c. Thus by Christ's act of  giving the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Peter and the apostles,  Matt. xvi. 19, and xviii. 18, 19, the keys belong to the officers of the  church by divine right. By God's act of _setting in the Church some,  first apostles_, &c., 1 Cor. xii. 28, all those officers belong to the  general visible Church by divine right. By Christ's act of bounty upon  his triumphant ascension into heaven, _in giving gifts to men_, Eph.  iv. 7, 11, 12; all those church officers being Christ's gifts, are of  divine right. Finally, by the Holy Ghost's act, in setting elders,  overseers over the flock, Acts xx. 28, elders are such overseers by  divine right.          CHAPTER VII.    V. _Of a Divine Right by Divine Precepts._      V. Finally, and primarily, by divine precepts, whatsoever in matters of  religion is commanded or forbidden by God in his word, that is  accordingly a duty or sin, by divine right: as, the duties of the whole  moral law, the ten words, commanded of God, Exod. xx.; Deut. v.  Believing in Christ, commanded of God, 1 John iii. 23. The plentiful and  honorable maintenance of ministers, commanded of God, 1 Tim. v. 17, 18;  1 Cor. ix. 9-11, 13, 14; Gal. vi. 6. The people's esteeming, loving, and  obeying their pastors and teachers, commanded of God, 1 Thess. v. 12;  Heb. xiii. 7, 17. Ministers' diligence and faithfulness, in feeding and  watching over their flocks, commanded of God, Acts xx. 28; 2 Tim. iv.  1-3; 1 Pet. iv. 1-3; with innumerable commands and precepts of all  sorts: now all things so commanded are evidently of divine right, and  without gainsaying, granted on all hands, even by Erastians themselves.  But the question will be, how far we shall extend this head of _divine  commands_. For clearness' sake, thus distinguish, thus resolve:    God's commands are either immediate or mediate.    1. Immediate divine commands: as those which God propounds and urges; as  the ten commandments, Exod. xx., Deut. v., and all other injunctions of  his in his word positively laid down. Of such commands, the apostle  saith, \"I command, yet not I, but the Lord,\" 1 Cor. vii. 10.    Now these immediate commands of God, in regard of their manner of  publishing and propounding, are either explicit or implicit.    1. Explicit: which are expressly and in plain terms laid down, as the  letter of the commandments of the decalogue, Exod. xx. The commands of  Christ, \"Feed my lambs, feed my sheep,\" John xxi.; \"Go, disciple"]]]
