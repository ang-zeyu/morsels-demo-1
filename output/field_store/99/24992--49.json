Or, do men desire the more substantial and  permanent grandeur of genius? Neither has this an immunity. He who by  force of will or of thought, is great, and overlooks[103] thousands,  has the charges of that eminence. With every influx of light comes new  danger. Has he light? he must bear witness to the light, and always  outrun that sympathy which gives him such keen satisfaction, by his  fidelity to new revelations of the incessant soul. He must hate father  and mother, wife and child. Has he all that the world loves and  admires and covets?--he must cast behind him their admiration, and  afflict them by faithfulness to his truth, and become a by-word and a  hissing.    This law writes the laws of cities and nations. It is in vain to build  or plot or combine against it. Things refuse to be mismanaged long.  _Res nolunt diu male administrari._[104] Though no checks to a new  evil appear, the checks exist, and will appear. If the government is  cruel, the governor's life is not safe. If you tax too high, the  revenue will yield nothing. If you make the criminal code sanguinary,  juries will not convict. If the law is too mild, private vengeance  comes in. If the government is a terrific democracy, the pressure is  resisted by an overcharge of energy in the citizen, and life glows  with a fiercer flame. The true life and satisfactions of man seem to  elude the utmost rigors or felicities of condition, and to establish  themselves with great indifferency under all varieties of  circumstances. Under all governments the influence of character  remains the same,--in Turkey and in New England about alike. Under the  primeval despots of Egypt, history honestly confesses that man must  have been as free as culture could make him.    These appearances indicate the fact that the universe is represented  in every one of its particles. Everything in nature contains all the  powers of nature. Everything is made of one hidden stuff; as the  naturalist sees one type under every metamorphosis, and regards a  horse as a running man, a fish as a swimming man, a bird as a flying  man, a tree as a rooted man. Each new form repeats not only the main  character of the type, but part for part all the details, all the  aims, furtherances, hindrances, energies, and whole system of every  other. Every occupation, trade, art, transaction, is a compend of the  world and a correlative of every other. Each one is an entire emblem  of human life; of its good and ill, its trials, its enemies, its  course and its end. And each one must somehow accommodate the whole  man, and recite all his destiny.    The world globes itself in a drop of dew.[105] The microscope cannot  find the animalcule which is less perfect for being little.[106] Eyes,  ears, taste, smell, motion, resistance, appetite, and organs of  reproduction that take hold on eternity,--all find room to consist in  the small creature. So do we put our life into every act. The true  doctrine of omnipresence is, that God reappears with all his parts in  every moss and cobweb.[107] The value of the universe contrives to  throw itself into every point. If the good is there, so is the evil;  if the affinity, so the repulsion; if the force, so the limitation.    Thus is the universe alive. All things are moral. That soul, which  within us is a sentiment, outside of us is a law. We feel its  inspiration; out there in history we can see its fatal strength. \"It  is in the world, and the world was made by it.\" Justice is not  postponed. A perfect equity adjusts its balance in all parts of life.  [Greek: Hoi  kyboi Dios aei eupiptousi],[108]--the dice of God are  always loaded. The world looks like a multiplication table, or a  mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself.  Take what figure you will, its exact value, nor more nor less, still  returns to you. Every secret is told, every crime is punished, every  virtue rewarded, every wrong redressed, in silence and certainty. What  we call retribution is the universal necessity by which the whole  appears wherever a part appears. If you see smoke, there must be fire.  If you see a hand or limb, you know that the trunk to which it belongs  is there behind.    Every act rewards itself, or, in other words, integrates itself, in a  twofold manner; first, in the thing, or in real nature; and secondly,  in the circumstance, or in apparent nature. Men call the circumstance  the retribution. The causal retribution is in the thing, and is seen  by the soul. The retribution in the circumstance is seen by the  understanding; it is inseparable from the thing, but is often spread  over a long time, and so does not become distinct until after many  years. The specific stripes may follow late after the offense, but  they follow because they accompany it. Crime and punishment grow out  of one stem. Punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the  flower of the pleasure which concealed it. Cause and effect, means and  ends, seed and fruit, cannot be severed; for the effect already blooms  in the cause, the end preexists in the means, the fruit in the seed.    Whilst thus the world will be whole, and refuses to be disparted, we  seek to act partially, to sunder, to appropriate; for example,--to  gratify the senses, we sever the pleasure of the senses from the needs  of the character. The ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to  the solution of one problem,--how to detach the sensual sweet, the  sensual strong, the sensual bright, etc., from the moral sweet, the  moral deep, the moral fair; that is, again, to contrive to cut clean  off this upper surface so thin as to leave it bottomless; to get a  _one end_, without an _other end_. The soul says, Eat; the body would  feast. The soul says, The man and woman shall be one flesh and one  soul; the body would join the flesh only. The soul says, Have dominion  over all things to the ends of virtue; the body would have the power  over things to its own ends.    The soul strives amain[109] to live and work through all things. It  would be the only fact. All things shall be added unto it,--power,  pleasure, knowledge, beauty. The particular man aims to be somebody;  to set up for himself; to truck and higgle for a private good; and, in  particulars, to ride, that he may ride; to dress, that he may be  dressed; to eat, that he may eat; and to govern, that he may be seen.  Men seek to be great; they would have offices, wealth, power, and  fame. They think that to be great is to possess one side of  nature,--the sweet, without the other side,--the bitter.    This dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted. Up to this day,  it must be owned, no projector has had the smallest success. The  parted water reunites behind our hand. Pleasure is taken out of  pleasant things, profit out of profitable things, power out of strong  things, as soon as we seek to separate them from the whole. We can no  more have things and get the sensual good, by itself, than we can get  an inside that shall have no outside, or a light without a shadow.  \"Drive out nature with a fork, she comes running back.\"[110]    Life invests itself with inevitable conditions, which the unwise seek  to dodge, which one and another brags that he does not know; that they  do not touch him;--but the brag is on his lips, the conditions are in  his soul. If he escapes them in one part, they attack him in another  more vital part. If he has escaped them in form, and in the  appearance, it is because he has resisted his life, and fled from  himself, and the retribution is so much death. So signal is the  failure of all attempts to make this separation of the good from the  tax, that the experiment would not be tried,--since to try it is to be  mad,--but for the circumstance, that when the disease began in the  will, of rebellion and separation, the intellect is at once infected,  so that the man ceases to see God whole in each object, but is able to  see the sensual allurement of an object, and not see the sensual hurt;  he sees the mermaid's head, but not the dragon's tail; and thinks he  can cut off that which he would have, from that which he would not  have. \"How secret art thou who dwellest in the highest heavens in  silence, O thou only great God, sprinkling with an unwearied  Providence certain penal blindnesses upon such as have unbridled  desires!\"[111]    The human soul is true to these facts in the painting of fable, of  history, of law, of proverbs, of conversation. It finds a tongue in  literature unawares. Thus the Greeks called Jupiter,[112] Supreme  Mind; but having traditionally ascribed to him many base actions, they  involuntarily made amends to reason, by tying up the hands[113] of so  bad a god. He is made as helpless as a king of England.[114]  Prometheus[115] knows one secret which Jove must bargain for;  Minerva,[116] another. He cannot get his own thunders; Minerva keeps  the key of them.       \"Of all the gods, I only know the keys      That ope the solid doors within whose vaults      His thunders sleep.\"    A plain confession of the in-working of the All, and of its moral aim.  The Indian mythology ends in the same ethics; and it would seem  impossible for any fable to be invented to get any currency which was  not moral. Aurora[117] forgot to ask youth for her lover, and though  Tithonus is immortal, he is old, Achilles[118] is not quite  invulnerable; the sacred waters did not wash the heel by which Thetis  held him. Siegfried,[119] in the Niebelungen, is not quite immortal,  for a leaf fell on his back whilst he was bathing in the dragon's  blood, and that spot which it covered is mortal. And so it must be.  There is a crack in everything God has made. It would seem, there is  always this vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares, even into  the wild poesy in which the human fancy attempted to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#9)"],[1,"joy?...

Ancient Babylonia was for over four thousand years the garden of  Western Asia. In the days of Hezekiah and Isaiah, when it had come  under the sway of the younger civilization of Assyria on the north, it  was \"a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of  oil olive and of honey[28]\". Herodotus found it still flourishing and  extremely fertile. \"This territory\", he wrote, \"is of all that we know  the best by far for producing grain; it is so good that it returns as  much as two hundredfold for the average, and, when it bears at its  best, it produces three hundredfold. The blades of the wheat and  barley there grow to be full four fingers broad; and from millet and  sesame seed, how large a tree grows, I know myself, but shall not  record, being well aware that even what has already been said relating  to the crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those who  have not visited Babylonia[29].\" To-day great tracts of undulating  moorland, which aforetime yielded two and three crops a year, are in  summer partly barren wastes and partly jungle and reedy swamp.  Bedouins camp beside sandy heaps which were once populous and thriving  cities, and here and there the shrunken remnants of a people once  great and influential eke out precarious livings under the oppression  of Turkish tax-gatherers who are scarcely less considerate than the  plundering nomads of the desert.    This historic country is bounded on the east by Persia and on the west  by the Arabian desert. In shape somewhat resembling a fish, it lies  between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, 100 miles  wide at its broadest part, and narrowing to 35 miles towards the  \"tail\" in the latitude of Baghdad; the \"head\" converges to a point  above Basra, where the rivers meet and form the Shatt-el-Arab, which  pours into the Persian Gulf after meeting the Karun and drawing away  the main volume of that double-mouthed river. The distance from  Baghdad to Basra is about 300 miles, and the area traversed by the  Shatt-el-Arab is slowly extending at the rate of a mile every thirty  years or so, as a result of the steady accumulation of silt and mud  carried down by the Tigris and Euphrates. When Sumeria was beginning  to flourish, these two rivers had separate outlets, and Eridu, the  seat of the cult of the sea god Ea, which now lies 125 miles inland,  was a seaport at the head of the Persian Gulf. A day's journey  separated the river mouths when Alexander the Great broke the power of  the Persian Empire.    In the days of Babylonia's prosperity the Euphrates was hailed as \"the  soul of the land\" and the Tigris as \"the bestower of blessings\".  Skilful engineers had solved the problem of water distribution by  irrigating sun-parched areas and preventing the excessive flooding of  those districts which are now rendered impassable swamps when the  rivers overflow. A network of canals was constructed throughout the  country, which restricted the destructive tendencies of the Tigris and  Euphrates and developed to a high degree their potentialities as  fertilizing agencies. The greatest of these canals appear to have been  anciently river beds. One, which is called Shatt en Nil to the north,  and Shatt el Kar to the south, curved eastward from Babylon, and  sweeping past Nippur, flowed like the letter S towards Larsa and then  rejoined the river. It is believed to mark the course followed in the  early Sumerian period by the Euphrates river, which has moved steadily  westward many miles beyond the sites of ancient cities that were  erected on its banks. Another important canal, the Shatt el Hai,  crossed the plain from the Tigris to its sister river, which lies  lower at this point, and does not run so fast. Where the artificial  canals were constructed on higher levels than the streams which fed  them, the water was raised by contrivances known as \"shaddufs\"; the  buckets or skin bags were roped to a weighted beam, with the aid of  which they were swung up by workmen and emptied into the canals. It is  possible that this toilsome mode of irrigation was substituted in  favourable parts by the primitive water wheels which are used in our  own day by the inhabitants of the country who cultivate strips of land  along the river banks.    In Babylonia there are two seasons--the rainy and the dry. Rain falls  from November till March, and the plain is carpeted in spring by  patches of vivid green verdure and brilliant wild flowers. Then the  period of drought ensues; the sun rapidly burns up all vegetation, and  everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches of brown and yellow  desert. Occasional sandstorms darken the heavens, sweeping over  sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless mounds which mark the sites  of ancient cities. Meanwhile the rivers are increasing in volume,  being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources far to the  north. The swift Tigris, which is 1146 miles long, begins to rise  early in March and reaches its highest level in May; before the end of  June it again subsides. More sluggish in movement, the Euphrates,  which is 1780 miles long, shows signs of rising a fortnight later than  the Tigris, and is in flood for a more extended period; it does not  shrink to its lowest level until early in September. By controlling  the flow of these mighty rivers, preventing disastrous floods, and  storing and distributing surplus water, the ancient Babylonians  developed to the full the natural resources of their country, and made  it--what it may once again become--one of the fairest and most  habitable areas in the world. Nature conferred upon them bountiful  rewards for their labour; trade and industries flourished, and the  cities increased in splendour and strength. Then as now the heat was  great during the long summer, but remarkably dry and unvarying, while  the air was ever wonderfully transparent under cloudless skies of  vivid blue. The nights were cool and of great beauty, whether in  brilliant moonlight or when ponds and canals were jewelled by the  lustrous displays of clear and numerous stars which glorified that  homeland of the earliest astronomers.    Babylonia is a treeless country, and timber had to be imported from  the earliest times. The date palm was probably introduced by man, as  were certainly the vine and the fig tree, which were widely  cultivated, especially in the north. Stone, suitable for building, was  very scarce, and limestone, alabaster, marble, and basalt had to be  taken from northern Mesopotamia, where the mountains also yield copper  and lead and iron. Except Eridu, where ancient workers quarried  sandstone from its sea-shaped ridge, all the cities were built of  brick, an excellent clay being found in abundance. When brick walls  were cemented with bitumen they were given great stability. This  resinous substance is found in the north and south. It bubbles up  through crevices of rocks on river banks and forms small ponds. Two  famous springs at modern Hit, on the Euphrates, have been drawn upon  from time immemorial. \"From one\", writes a traveller, \"flows hot water  black with bitumen, while the other discharges intermittently bitumen,  or, after a rainstorm, bitumen and cold water.... Where rocks crop out  in the plain above Hit, they are full of seams of bitumen.\"[30]  Present-day Arabs call it \"kiyara\", and export it for coating boats  and roofs; they also use it as an antiseptic, and apply it to cure the  skin diseases from which camels suffer.    Sumeria had many surplus products, including corn and figs, pottery,  fine wool and"]]]
