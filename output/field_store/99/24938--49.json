On the contrary, the most definite instructions have  repeatedly been issued to German war vessels to avoid attacks on such  ships under all circumstances. Even when such ships have contraband of  war on board they are dealt with by submarines solely according to the  rules of international law applying to prize warfare.    Second--Should a neutral ship nevertheless come to harm through German  submarines or aircraft on account of an unfortunate (X) [mistake?] in  the above-mentioned zone of naval warfare, the German Government will  unreservedly recognize its responsibility therefor. In such a case it  will express its regrets and afford damages without first instituting a  prize court action.    Third--It is the custom of the German Government as soon as the sinking  of a neutral ship in the above-mentioned zone of naval warfare is  ascribed to German war vessels to institute an immediate investigation  into the cause. If grounds appear thereby to be given for association of  such a hypothesis the German Navy places itself in communication with  the interested neutral Government so that the latter may also institute  an investigation. If the German Government is thereby convinced that the  ship has been destroyed by Germany's war vessels, it will not delay in  carrying out the provisions of Paragraph 2 above. In case the German  Government, contrary to the viewpoint of the neutral Government is not  convinced by the result of the investigation, the German Government has  already on several occasions declared itself ready to allow the question  to be decided by an international investigation commission, according to  Chapter 3 of The Hague Convention of Oct. 18, 1907, for the peaceful  solution of international disputes.    _This circular is understood to have been rather reassuring to high  officials of the United States Government, although it does not cover  the attitude of the German Government toward the treatment to be  accorded to Americans and other neutral noncombatants, men, women, and  children, on board vessels flying the flag of England, France, or  Russia. The absence of any allusion to the principle involved in the  Lusitania case is believed here to mean that the statement was prepared  and was ready for promulgation before the destruction of the Lusitania  on Friday. Several days usually have been required for messages to come  to Washington from Ambassador Gerard, by roundabout cable relay route,  and it is believed that this dispatch is no exception in this respect._      DR. DERNBURG'S DEFENSE.    _The sinking of the Lusitania as a man-of-war was justified by Dr.  Bernhard Dernburg, late German Colonial Secretary and recognized as  quasi-official spokesman of the German Imperial Government in the United  States, in a statement issued in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 8, 1915. The  statement reads:_    Great Britain declared the North Sea a war zone in the Winter. No  protest was made by the United States or any neutral. Great Britain held  up all neutral ships carrying non-contraband goods, detaining them,  buying or confiscating their cargoes.    Great Britain constantly changed the contraband lists, so no foodstuffs  of any kind have actually reached Germany since the war began.  International law says foodstuffs destined for the civil population must  pass. It does not recognize any right to starve out a whole people.    As a consequence, and in retaliation, Germany declared the waters around  England a war zone, and started a submarine warfare. It became known in  February that British ships were flying the American flag as a  protection.    Great Britain replied by officially declaring its purpose to starve  120,000,000 Germans and Austrians. The United States very thoughtfully  tried to mediate, proposing that foodstuffs should be passed and  submarine warfare be stopped.    Germany agreed; England turned the proposal down. Then, in order to  protect American passengers, they were warned by public advertisement of  the danger of sailing under the flag of a belligerent.    Vessels carrying contraband of war are liable to destruction unless they  can be taken to a port of the country that captures them. The right of  search need not be exercised if it is certain such ships carry  contraband.    Oil is contraband, like war ammunition and all metals. The master of the  Gulflight (an American oil tank steamer sunk recently) swore before  customs officials to his cargo of oil for France.    The master of the Lusitania similarly swore to his manifest of cargo of  metals and ammunition. Both the Gulflight and the Lusitania carried  contraband when attacked, it is obvious.    The Lusitania's manifest showed she carried for Liverpool 260,000 pounds  of brass; 60,000 pounds of copper; 189 cases of military goods; 1,271  cases of ammunition, and for London, 4,200 cases of cartridges.    Vessels of that kind can be seized and be destroyed under The Hague  rules without any respect to a war zone. The Lusitania was a British  auxiliary cruiser, a man-of-war. On the same day she sailed the  Cameronia, another Cunarder, was commandeered in New York Harbor for  military service.    The fact is that the Lusitania was a British war vessel under orders of  the Admiralty to carry a cargo of contraband of war. The passengers had  had full warning, first by the German note to England in February,  second by advertisement.    Germany wants to do anything reasonable so as not to make the United  States or its citizens suffer in any way. But she cannot do so unless  Americans will take necessary precautions to protect themselves from  dangers of which they are cognizant.    What Germany has done, she has done by way of retaliation after her  offer through President Wilson, regarding submarine warfare, was turned  down and after Britain declared the war was directed toward the  120,000,000 innocent noncombatants, women and children.    Americans can do their own thinking when the facts are laid before them.  I have really no authority to speak. But my mission in the United  States is to inform your people of the German attitude. The German  Ambassador, Count von Bernstorff, can speak only in official phrases. I  talk straight out, bluntly.    _Dr. Dernburg put much stress on the fact that the Cunard Line officials  did not warn American passengers that the ship carried a large store of  ammunition and other contraband of war. He continued:_    Did they issue a warning? I would like an answer. If that warning was  not given, American passengers were being used as a cloak for England's  war shipments.    It is not reasonable that such a vessel could not be sunk because there  were American passengers on board. They had been warned by Germany of  the danger.    England could hire one American to travel to and fro on each of her  ships, carry on shipments of arms, and place her men-of-war anywhere, if  American passengers can be used as shields.    _Asked whether he expected action by the United States because of the  Lusitania's sinking, Dr. Dernburg said:_    That is a question I cannot discuss. I can only say that any ship flying  the American flag and not carrying contraband of war is and will be as  safe as a cradle. But any other ship, not so exempt, is as unsafe as a  volcano--or as was the Lusitania.    _When he was told that the Transylvania, another Cunard liner, sailed  from New York on May 7, to cover the same route as the Lusitania, Dr.  Dernburg said:_    I can only say that the German warnings will reappear henceforth by  advertisement. That is significant.          German Press Opinion      _Contrasting with the attitude of the German-American press since the  issuance of President Wilson's note of May 13 to the German Imperial  Government, the comment of the press in Germany has been in accordance  with the German official statements put forth prior to the receipt of  the American note. Under date of May 9, 1915, the following dispatch by  The Associated Press was received from Berlin:_    _Commenting on the destruction Lusitania, the Berliner Tageblatt says:_    With deep emotion we learn of the destruction of the Lusitania, in  which countless men lost their lives. We lament with sincere hearts  their hard fate, but we know we are completely devoid of blame.    We may be sure that through the English telegrams communicated to the  world indignation will again be raised against Germany, but we must hope  that calm reflection will later pronounce the verdict of condemnation  against the British Admiralty.    The many who are now sorrowing may raise complaint against Winston  Spencer Churchill, First Lord of the British Admiralty, who, by  conscienceless instructions which must bring him the curse of mankind,  conjured up this cruel warfare....    The Lusitania was a warship on the list of English auxiliary cruisers  and carried armament of twelve strongly mounted guns. She was more  strongly mounted with guns than any German armored cruiser. As an  auxiliary cruiser she must have been prepared for attack.    _Count von Reventlow, the naval expert, says, in the Tages Zeitung:_    The American Government probably will make the case the basis for  diplomatic action, but it could have prevented the loss of American  lives by appropriate instructions. It is the American Government's  fault, therefore, if it did not take Germany's war zone declarations  seriously enough.    _The writer declares, further, that Germany had full and trustworthy  information that the Lusitania carried a cargo "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15483"],[0,"Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (#9)"],[1,"    16. The author's explanation is partly erroneous. The temple, which  is a very remarkable one, is dedicated to the sixty-four Joginis.  Only five temples in India are known to be dedicated to these demons.  For details see Cunningham, _A.S.R.,_ vol. ix, pp. 61-74, pl. xii-  xvi; vol. ii, p. 416; and vol. xxi, p. 57. The word _vahana_ means  'vehicle'. Each deity has his peculiar vehicle.    17. The heaven of Siva, as distinguished from Vaikuntha, the heaven  of Vishnu. It is supposed to be somewhere in the Himalaya mountains.  The wonderful excavated rock temple at Ellora is believed to be a  model of Kailas.    18. This 'notion' of the author's is not likely to find acceptance at  the present day.          CHAPTER 2      Hindoo System of Religion.    The Hindoo system is this. A great divine spirit or essence,  'Brahma', pervades the whole universe; and the soul of every human  being is a drop from this great ocean, to which, when it becomes  perfectly purified, it is reunited. The reunion is the eternal  beatitude to which all look forward with hope; and the soul of the  Brahman is nearest to it. If he has been a good man, his soul becomes  absorbed in the 'Brahma'; and, if a bad man, it goes to 'Narak',  hell; and after the expiration of its period there of _limited  imprisonment_, it returns to earth, and occupies the body of some  other animal. It again advances by degrees to the body of the  Brahman; and thence, when fitted for it, into the great 'Brahma'.[1]    From this great eternal essence emanate Brahma, the Creator, whose  consort is Sarasvati;[2] Vishnu, the Preserver, whose consort is  Lakshmi; and Siva, _alias_ Mahadeo, the Destroyer, whose consort is  Parvati. According to popular belief Jamraj (Yamaraja) is the  judicial deity who has been appointed by the greater powers to pass  the final judgement on the tenor of men's lives, according to  proceedings drawn up by his secretary Chitragupta. If men's actions  have been good, their souls are, as the next stage, advanced a step  towards the great essence, Brahma; and, if bad, they are thrown back,  and obliged to occupy the bodies of brutes or of people of inferior  caste, as the balance against them may be great or small. There is an  intermediate stage, a 'Narak', or hell, for bad men, and a  'Baikunth', or paradise, for the good, in which they find their  felicity in serving that god of the three to which they have  specially devoted themselves while on earth. But from this stage,  after the period of their sentence is expired, men go back to their  pilgrimage on earth again.    There are numerous Deos (Devas), or good spirits, of whom Indra is  the chief; [3] and Daityas, or bad spirits; and there have also been  a great number of incarnations from the three great gods, and their  consorts, who have made their appearance upon the earth when required  for particular purposes. All these incarnations are called 'Avatars',  or descents. Vishnu has been eleven times on the globe in different  shapes, and Siva seven times.[4] The avatars of Vishnu are celebrated  in many popular poems, such as the Ramayana, or history of the Rape  of Sita, the wife of Rama, the seventh incarnation;[5] the  Mahabharata, and the Bhagavata [Purana], which describe the wars and  amours of this god in his last human shape.[6] All these books are  believed to have been written either by the hand or by the  inspiration of the god himself thousands of years before the events  they describe actually took place. 'It was', they say, 'as easy for  the deity to write or dictate a battle, an amour, or any other  important event ten thousand years before as the day after it took  place'; and I believe nine-tenths, perhaps ninety-nine in a hundred,  of the Hindoo population believe implicitly that these accounts were  also written. It is now pretty clear that all these works are of  comparatively recent date, that the great poem of the Mahabharata  could not have been written before the year 786 of the Christian era,  and was probably written so late as A.D. 1157; that Krishna, _if born  at all_, must have been born on the 7th of August, A.D. 600, but was  most likely a mere creation of the imagination to serve the purpose  of the Brahmans of Ujain, in whom the fiction originated; that the  other incarnations were invented about the same time, and for the  same object, though the other persons described as incarnations were  real princes, Parasu Rama, before Christ 1176, and Rama, born before  Christ 961. In the Mahabharata Krishna is described as fighting in  the same army with Yudhishthira and his four brothers. Yudhishthira  was a real person, who ascended the throne at Delhi 575 B.C., or 1175  years before the birth of Krishna.[7] Bentley supposes that the  incarnations, particularly that of Krishna, were invented by the  Brahmans of Ujain with a view to check the progress of Christianity  in that part of the world (see his historical view of the Hindoo  astronomy). That we find in no history any account of the alarming  progress of Christianity about the time these fables were written is  no proof that Bentley was wrong.[8]    When Monsieur Thevenot was at Agra [in] 1666, the Christian  population was roughly estimated at twenty-five thousand families.  They had all passed away before it became one of our civil and  military stations in the beginning of the present century, and we  might search history in vain for any mention of them (see his  _Travels in India_, Part III). One single prince, well disposed to  give Christians encouragement and employment, might, in a few years,  get the same number around his capital; and it is probable that the  early Christians in India occasionally found such princes, and gave  just cause of alarm to the Brahman priests, who were then in the  infancy of their despotic power.[9]    During the war with Nepal, in 1814 and 1815,[10] the division with  which I served came upon an extremely interesting colony of about two  thousand Christian families at Betiya in the Tirhut District, on the  borders of the Tarai forest. This colony had been created by one man,  the Bishop, a Venetian by birth, under the protection of a small  Hindoo prince, the Raja, of Betiya.[11] This holy man had been some  fifty years among these people, with little or no support from Europe  or from any other quarter. The only aid he got from the Raja was a  pledge that no member of his Church should be subject to the  _Purveyance system_, under which the people everywhere suffered so  much,[12] and this pledge the Raja, though a Hindoo, had never  suffered to be violated. There were men of all trades among them, and  they formed one very large street remarkable for the superior style  of its buildings and the sober industry of its inhabitants. The  masons, carpenters, and blacksmiths of this little colony were  working in our camp every day, while we remained in the vicinity, and  better workmen I have never seen in India; but they would all insist  upon going to divine service at the prescribed hours. They had built  a splendid _pucka_[13] dwelling-house for their bishop, and a still  more splendid church, and formed for him the finest garden I have  seen in India, surrounded with a good wall, and provided with  admirable pucka wells. The native Christian servants who attended at  the old bishop's table, taught by himself, spoke Latin to him; but he  was become very feeble, and spoke himself a mixture of Latin,  Italian, his native tongue, and Hindustani. We used to have him at  our messes, and take as much care of him as of an infant, for he was  become almost as frail as one. The joy and the excitement of being  once more among Europeans, and treated by them with so much reverence  in the midst of his flock, were perhaps too much for him, for he  sickened and died soon after.    The Raja died soon after him, and in all probability the flock has  disappeared. No Europeans except a few indigo planters of the  neighbourhood had ever before known or heard of this colony; and they  seemed to consider them only as a set of great scoundrels, who had  better carts and bullocks than anybody else in the country, which  they refused to let out at the same rate as the others, and which  they (the indigo lords) were not permitted to seize and employ at  discretion. Roman Catholics have a greater facility in making  converts in India than Protestants, from having so much more in their  form of worship to win the affections through the medium of the  imagination.[14]      Notes:    1. Men are occasionally exempted from the necessity of becoming a  Brahman first. Men of low caste, if they die at particular places,  where it is the interest of the Brahmans to invite rich men to die,  are promised absorption into the great 'Brahma' at once. Immense  numbers of wealthy men go every year from the most distant parts of  India to die at Benares, where they spend large sums of money among  the Brahmans. It is by their means that this, the second city in  India, is supported. [W. H. S.] Bombay is now the second city in  India, so far as population is concerned.    2. Brahma, with the short vowel, is the eternal Essence or Spirit;  Brahma, with the long vowel, is 'the primaeval male god, the first  personal product of the purely spiritual Brahma, when overspread by  Maya, or illusory creative force', according to the Vedanta system  (Monier Williams, _Religious Thought and Life in India_, p. 44).    3. Indra was originally, in the Vedas, the Rain-god. The statement in  the text refers to modern Hinduism.    4. The incarnations of Vishnu are ordinarily reckoned as ten, namely,  (1) Fish, (2) Tortoise, (3) Boar, (4) Man-lion, (5) Dwarf, (6) Rama  with the axe, (7) Rama Chandra, (8) Krishna, (9) Buddha, (10) Kalki,  or Kalkin, who is yet to come. I do not know any authority for eleven  incarnations of Vishnu. The number is stated in some Puranas as  twenty-two, twenty-four, or even twenty-ei"]]]
