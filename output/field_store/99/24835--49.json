His letters to  male friends are full of the most passionate expressions of love. His  violent death also appears to have been due to a love-adventure with a  man. The murderer was a cook, a wholly uncultivated man, a criminal who  had already been condemned to death, and shortly before murdering  Winkelmann for the sake of plunder he was found to be on very intimate  terms with him.[67] It is noteworthy that sexual inversion should so often  be found associated with the study of antiquity. It must not, however, be  too hastily concluded that this is due to suggestion and that to abolish  the study of Greek literature and art would be largely to abolish sexual  inversion. What has really occurred in those recent cases that may be  studied, and therefore without doubt in the older cases, is that the  subject of congenital sexual inversion is attracted to the study of Greek  antiquity because he finds there the explanation and the apotheosis of his  own obscure impulses. Undoubtedly that study tends to develop these  impulses.    While it is peculiarly easy to name men of distinguished ability who,  either certainly or in all probability, have been affected by homosexual  tendencies, they are not isolated manifestations. They spring out of an  element of diffused homosexuality which is at least as marked in  civilization as it is in savagery. It is easy to find illustrations in  every country. Here it may suffice to refer to France, Germany, and  England.    In France in the thirteenth century the Church was so impressed by the  prevalence of homosexuality that it reasserted the death penalty for  sodomy at the Councils of Paris (1212) and Rouen (1214), while we are told  that even by rejecting a woman's advances (as illustrated in Marie de  France's _Lai de Lanval_) a man fell under suspicion as a sodomist, which  was also held to involve heresy.[68] At the end of this century (about  1294) Alain de Lille was impelled to write a book, _De Planctu Naturae_, in  order to call attention to the prevalence of homosexual feeling; he also  associated the neglect of women with sodomy. \"Man is made woman,\" he  writes; \"he blackens the honor of his sex, the craft of magic Venus makes  him of double gender\"; nobly beautiful youths have \"turned their hammers  of love to the office of anvils,\" and \"many kisses lie untouched on maiden  lips.\" The result is that \"the natural anvils,\" that is to say the  neglected maidens, \"bewail the absence of their hammers and are seen sadly  to demand them.\" Alain de Lille makes himself the voice of this  demand.[69]    A few years later, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, sodomy was  still regarded as very prevalent. At that time it was especially  associated with the Templars who, it has been supposed, brought it from  the East. Such a supposition, however, is not required to account for the  existence of homosexuality in France. Nor is it necessary, at a somewhat  later period, to invoke, as is frequently done, the Italian origin of  Catherine de Medici, in order to explain the prevalence of homosexual  practices at her court.    Notwithstanding its prevalence, sodomy was still severely punished from  time to time. Thus in 1586, Dadon, who had formerly been Rector of the  University of Paris, was hanged and then burned for injuring a child  through sodomy.[70] In the seventeenth century, homosexuality continued,  however, to flourish, and it is said that nearly all the numerous  omissions made in the published editions of Tallement des Reaux's  _Historiettes_ refer to sodomy.[71]    How prominent homosexuality was, in the early eighteenth century in  France, we learn from the frequent references to it in the letters of  Madame, the mother of the Regent, whose husband was himself effeminate and  probably inverted.[72] For the later years of the century the evidence  abounds on every hand. At this time the Bastille was performing a useful  function, until recently overlooked by historians, as an _asile de surete_  for abnormal persons whom it was considered unsafe to leave at large.  Inverts whose conduct became too offensive to be tolerated were frequently  placed in the Bastille which, indeed \"abounded in homosexual subjects,\" to  a greater extent than any other class of sexual perverts. Some of the  affairs which led to the Bastille have a modern air. One such case on a  large scale occurred in 1702, and reveals an organized system of  homosexual prostitution; one of the persons involved in this affair was a  handsome, well-made youth named Lebel, formerly a lackey, but passing  himself off as a man of quality. Seduced at the age of 10 by a famous  sodomist named Duplessis, he had since been at the disposition of a number  of homosexual persons, including officers, priests, and marquises. Some of  the persons involved in these affairs were burned alive; some cut their  own throats; others again were set at liberty or transferred to the  Bicetre.[73] During the latter part of the eighteenth century, also, we  find another modern homosexual practice recognized in France; the  rendezvous or center where homosexual persons could quietly meet each  other.[74]    Inversion has always been easy to trace in Germany. Ammianus Marcellinus  bears witness to its prevalence among some German tribes in later Roman  days.[75] In mediaeval times, as Schultz points out, references to sodomy  in Germany were far from uncommon. Various princes of the German Imperial  house, and of other princely families in the Middle Ages, were noted for  their intimate friendships. At a later date, attention has frequently been  called to the extreme emotional warmth which has often marked German  friendship, even when there has been no suspicion of any true homosexual  relationship.[76] The eighteenth century, in the full enjoyment of that  abandonment to sentiment initiated by Rousseau, proved peculiarly  favorable to the expansion of the tendency to sentimental friendship. On  this basis a really inverted tendency, when it existed, could easily come  to the surface and find expression. We find this well illustrated in the  poet Heinrich von Kleist who seems to have been of bisexual temperament,  and his feelings for the girl he wished to marry were, indeed, much cooler  than those for his friend. To this friend, Ernst von Pfuel (afterward  Prussian war minister), Kleist wrote in 1805 at the age of 28: \"You bring  the days of the Greeks back to me; I could sleep with you, dear youth, my  whole soul so embraces you. When you used to bathe in the Lake of Thun I  would gaze with the real feelings of a girl at your beautiful body. It  would serve an artist to study from.\" There follows an enthusiastic  account of his friend's beauty and of the Greek \"idea of the love of  youths,\" and Kleist concludes: \"Go with me to Anspach, and let us enjoy  the sweets of friendship.... I shall never marry; you must be wife and  children to me.\"[77]    In all social classes and in all fields of activity, Germany during the  nineteenth century produced a long series of famous or notorious  homosexual persons. At the one end we find people of the highest  intellectual distinction, such as Alexander von Humboldt, whom Naecke, a  cautious investigator, stated that he had good ground for regarding as an  invert.[78] At the other end we find prosperous commercial and  manufacturing people who leave Germany to find solace in the free and  congenial homosexual atmosphere of Capri; of these F.A. Krupp, the head of  the famous Essen factory, may be regarded as the type.[79]    In England (and the same is true today of the United States), although  homosexuality has been less openly manifest and less thoroughly explored,  it is doubtful whether it has been less prevalent than in Germany. At an  early period, indeed, the evidence may even seem to show that it was more  prevalent. In the Penitentials of the ninth and tenth centuries \"natural  fornication and sodomy\" were frequently put together and the same penance  assigned to both; it was recognized that priests and bishops, as well as  laymen, might fall into this sin, though to the bishop nearly three times  as much penance was assigned as to the layman. Among the Normans,  everywhere, homosexuality was markedly prevalent; the spread of sodomy in  France about the eleventh century is attributed to the Normans, and their  coming seems to have rendered it at times almost fashionable, at all  events at court. In England William Rufus was undoubtedly inverted, as  later on were Edward II, James I, and, perhaps, though not in so  conspicuous a degree, William III.[80]    Ordericus Vitalis, who was himself half Norman and half English, says that  the Normans had become very effeminate in his time, and that after the  death of William the Conqueror sodomy was common both in England and  Normandy. Guillaume de Nangis, in his chronicle for about 1120, speaking  of the two sons of Henry and the company of young nobles who went down  with them, in the _White Ship_, states that nearly all were considered to  be sodomists, and Henry of Huntingdon, in his _History_, looked upon the  loss of the _White Ship_ as a judgment of heaven upon sodomy. Anselm, in  writing to Archdeacon William to inform him concerning the recent Council  at London (1102), gives advice as to how to deal with people who have  committed the sin of sodomy, and instructs him not to be too harsh with  those who have not realized its gravity, for hitherto \"this sin has been  so public that hardly anyone has blushed for it, and many, therefore, have  plunged into it without realizing its gravity.\"[81] So temperate a remark  by a man of such unquestionably high character is more significant of the  prevalence of homosexuality than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#9)"],[1,"no relationship whatever to      mice. The birds that began earliest to practise their      accomplishments would probably have most chance of success when      the females arrived. Darwin himself said that nothing is commoner      than for animals to take pleasure in practising whatever instinct      they follow at other times for some real good. These      manifestations are primarily for the sake of producing sexual      tumescence, and could not well have been developed to the height      they have reached unless they were connected closely with      propagation. That they may incidentally serve to express      \"gladness\" one need not feel called upon to question.        Another observer of birds, Mr. E. Selous, has made observations      which are of interest in this connection. He finds that all      bird-dances are not nuptial, but that some birds--the      stone-curlew (or great plover), for example--have different kinds      of dances. Among these birds he has made the observation, very      significant from our present point of view, that the nuptial      dances, taken part in by both of the pair, are immediately      followed by intercourse. In spring \"all such runnings and      chasings are, at this time, but a part of the business of      pairing, and one divines at once that such attitudes are of a      sexual character.... Here we have a bird with distinct nuptial      (sexual) and social (non-sexual) forms of display or antics, and      the former as well as the latter are equally indulged in by both      sexes.\" (E. Selous, _Bird Watching_, pp. 15-20.)        The same author (ibid., pp. 79, 94) argues that in the fights of      two males for one female--with violent emotion on one side and      interested curiosity on the other--the attitude of the former      \"might gradually come to be a display made entirely for the      female, and of the latter a greater or less degree of pleasurable      excitement raised by it, with a choice in accordance.\" On this      view the interest of the female would first have been directed,      not to the plumage, but to the frenzied actions and antics of the      male. From these antics in undecorated birds would gradually      develop the interest in waving plumes and fluttering wings. Such      a dance might come to be of a quite formal and non-courting      nature.        Last, we owe to Professor Haecker what may fairly be regarded, in      all main outlines, as an almost final statement of the matter. In      his _Gesang der Voegel_ (1900) he gives a very clear account of      the evolution of bird-song, which he regards as the most      essential element in all this group of manifestations, furnishing      the key also to the dancing and other antics. Originally the song      consists only of call-cries and recognition-notes. Under the      parallel influence of natural selection and sexual selection they      become at the pairing season reflexes of excitement and thus      develop into methods of producing excitement, in the male by the      muscular energy required, and in the female through the ear;      finally they become play, though here also it is probable that      use is not excluded. Thus, so far as the male bird is concerned,      bird-song possesses a primary prenuptial significance in      attracting the female, a secondary nuptial significance in      producing excitement (p. 48). He holds also that the      less-developed voices of the females aid in attaining the same      end (p. 51). Finally, bird-song possesses a tertiary extranuptial      significance (including exercise play, expression of gladness).      Haecker points out, at the same time, that the maintenance of some      degree of sexual excitement beyond pairing time may be of value      for the preservation of the species, in case of disturbance      during breeding and consequent necessity for commencing breeding      over again.        Such a theory as this fairly coincides with the views brought      forward in the preceding pages,--views which are believed to be      in harmony with the general trend of thought today,--since it      emphasizes the importance of tumescence and all that favors      tumescence in the sexual process. The so-called esthetic element      in sexual selection is only indirectly of importance. The male's      beauty is really a symbol of his force.        It will be seen that this attitude toward the facts of tumescence      among birds and other animals includes the recognition of dances,      songs, etc., as expressions of \"gladness.\" As such they are      closely comparable to the art manifestations among human races.      Here, as Weismann in his _Gedanken ueber Musik_ has remarked, we      may regard the artistic faculty as a by-product: \"This [musical]      faculty is, as it were, the mental hand with which we play on our      own emotional nature, a hand not shaped for this purpose, not due      to the necessity for the enjoyment of music, but owing its origin      to entirely different requirements.\"    The psychological significance of these facts has been carefully studied  and admirably developed by Groos in his classic works on the play instinct  in animals and in men.[27] Going beyond Wallace, Groos denies _conscious_  sexual selection, but, as he points out, this by no means involves the  denial of unconscious selection in the sense that \"the female is most  easily won by the male who most strongly excites her sexual instincts.\"  Groos further quotes a pregnant generalization of Ziegler: \"In all animals  a high degree of excitement of the nervous system is _necessary to  procreation_, and thus we find an excited prelude to procreation widely  spread.\"[28] Such a stage, indeed, as Groos points out, is usually  necessary before any markedly passionate discharge of motor energy, as may  be observed in angry dogs and the Homeric heroes. While, however, in other  motor explosions the prelude may be reduced to a minimum, in courtship it  is found in a highly marked degree. The primary object of courtship, Groos  insists, is to produce sexual excitement.    It is true that Groos's main propositions were by no means novel. Thus, as  I have pointed out, he was at most points anticipated by Tillier. But  Groos developed the argument in so masterly a manner, and with so many  wide-ranging illustrations, that he has carried conviction where the mere  insight of others had passed unperceived. Since Darwin wrote the _Descent  of Man_ the chief step in the development of the theory of sexual  selection has been taken by Groos, who has at the same time made it clear  that sexual selection is largely a special case of natural selection.[29]  The conjunction of the sexes is seen to be an end only to be obtained with  much struggle; the difficulty of achieving sexual erethism in both sexes,  the difficulty of so stimulating such erethism in the female that her  instinctive coyness is overcome, these difficulties the best and most  vigorous males,[30] those most adapted in other respects to carry on the  race, may most easily overcome. In this connection we may note what Marro  has said in another connection, when attempting to answer the question why  it is that among savages courtship becomes so often a matter in which  persuasion takes the form of force. The explanation, he remarks, is yet  very simple. Force is the foundation of virility, and its psychic  manifestation is courage. In the struggle for life violence is the first  virtue. The modesty of women--in its primordial form consisting in  physical resistance, active or passive, to the assaults of the male--aided  selection by putting to the test man's most important quality, force. Thus  it is that when choosing among rivals for her favors a woman attributes  value to violence.[31] Marro thus independently confirms the result  reached by Groos.    The debate which has for so many years been proceeding concerning the  validity of the theory of sexual selection may now be said to be brought  to an end. Those who supported Darwin and those who opposed him were, both  alike, in part right and in part wrong, and it is now possible to combine  the elements of truth on either side into a coherent whole. This is now  beginning to be widely recognized; Lloyd Morgan,[32] for instance, has  readjusted his position as regards the \"pairing instinct\" in the light of  Groos's contribution to the subject. \"The hypothesis of sexual selection,\"  he concludes, \"suggests that the accepted male is the one which adequately  evokes the pairing impulse.... Courtship may thus be regarded from the  physiological point of view as a means of producing the requisite amount  of pairing hunger; of stimulating the whole system and facilitating  general and special vascular changes; of creating that state of profound  and explosive irritability which has for its psychological concomitant or  antecedent an imperious and irresistible craving.... Courtship is thus  the strong and steady bending of the bow that the arrow may find its mark  in a biological end of the highest importance in the survival of a healthy  and vigorous race.\"        Having thus viewed the matter broadly, we may consider in detail      a few examples of the process of tumescence among the lower      animals and man, for, as will be seen, the process in both is      identical. As regards animal courtship, the best treasury of      facts is Brehm's _Thierleben_, while Buechner's _Liebe und      Liebes-Leben in der Thierwelt_ is a useful summary; the admirable      discussion of bird-dancing and other forms of courtship in      Haecker's _Gesang der Voegel_, chapter iv, may also be consulted.      As regards man, Wallaschek's _Primitive Music_, chapter vii,      brings together much scattered material, and is all the more      valuable since the author rejects any form of sexual selection;      Hirn's _Origins of Art_, chapter xvii, is well worth"]]]
