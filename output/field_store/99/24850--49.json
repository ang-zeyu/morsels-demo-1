Captain Jones determined to hazard an attack;  and as the weather was boisterous, and the swell of the sea unusually  high, he ordered down top-gallant yards, closely reefed the top-sails,  and prepared for action. We cannot give a detail of this brilliant  engagement, which resulted in the capture of the Frolic. It was one of  the most daring and determined actions in our naval history. The force  of the Frolic consisted of sixteen thirty-two pound carronades, four  twelve-pounders on the maindeck, and two twelve-pound carronades.  Both vessels had more men than was essential to their efficiency; but  while there was an equality of strength in the crews, there was an  inequality in the number of guns and weight of metal--the Frolic  having four twelve-pounders more than the Wasp. The exact number of  killed and wounded on board the Frolic could not be ascertained with  any degree of precision; but, from the admissions of the British  officers, it was supposed that their loss in killed was about thirty,  including two officers, and in wounded, between forty and fifty. The  captain and every other officer on board were more or less severely  wounded. The Wasp sustained a loss of only five men killed, and five  wounded.    While erecting jurymasts on board the Frolic, soon after, a suspicious  sail was seen to windward, upon which Captain Jones directed  Lieutenant Biddle to shape her course for Charleston, or any other  port of the United States, while the Wasp should continue upon  her cruise. The sail coming down rapidly, both vessels prepared  for action, but it was soon discovered, to the mortification of  the victors in this well-fought action, that the new enemy was a  seventy-four, which proved to be the Poictiers, commanded by Admiral  Beresford. Firing a shot over the Frolic, she passed her, and soon  overhauled the Wasp, which, in her crippled state, was unable to  escape. Both vessels were thus captured, and carried into Bermuda.  After a few weeks, a cartel was proposed by which the officers  and crew of the Wasp were conveyed to New York. On the return of  Captain Jones to the United States, he was everywhere received with  demonstrations of respect for the skill and gallantry displayed in his  combat with the enemy. The legislature of Delaware gave him a vote  of thanks, and a piece of plate. On the motion of James A. Bayard,  of Delaware, Congress appropriated twenty-five thousand dollars, as  a compensation to the commander, his officers, and crew, for the loss  they had sustained by the recapture of the Frolic. They also voted  a gold medal to the Captain, and a silver medal to each of his  commissioned officers. As a farther evidence of the confidence of  government, Captain Jones was ordered to the command of the frigate  Macedonian, recently captured from the British by Decatur. She was  rapidly fitted out under his direction, in the harbor of New York,  and proposed for one of Decatur's squadron, which was about to sail on  another expedition. In May 1811, the squadron attempted to put to  sea, but, in sailing up Long Island Sound, encountered a large British  force, which compelled the United States vessels to retreat into  New London. In this situation the enemy continued an uninterrupted  blockade during the war. Finding it impossible to avoid the vigilance  of Sir Thomas Hardy, who commanded the blockading fleet, the  government ordered Captain Jones to proceed with his officers and crew  to Sackett's Harbor, and report to Commodore Chauncey, as commander of  the frigate Mohawk, on lake Ontario. There the Americans maintained  an ascendency, and continued to cruise until October, when the British  squadron, under Sir James Yeo, left Kingston, with a greatly superior  force, which caused the United States squadron to return to Sackett's  Harbor. It seemed, indeed, that the contest now depended on the  exertions of the ship carpenters. Two line of battle ships were placed  on the stocks, and were advancing rapidly to completion, when, in  February 1815, the news of peace arrived, with orders to suspend  further operations on these vessels. A few weeks after the peace was  announced, Captain Jones with his officers and crew was ordered to  repair to the seaboard, and again to take command of the Macedonian,  to form part of the force against the Algerines, then depredating on  our commerce in the Mediterranean. As soon as the Algerian Regency was  informed that war existed between the United States and Great Britain,  the Dey dispatched his cruisers to capture all American merchant  vessels. To punish these freebooters, nine or ten vessels were fitted  out and placed under Decatur. This armament sailed from New York in  May, 1815, and when off Cadiz was informed that the Algerines were  along the southern coast of Spain. Two days after reaching the  Mediterranean, the United States squadron fell in with and captured  the Algerine frigate Messuado, mounting forty-six guns, and the next  day captured a large brig of war, both of which were carried into the  port of Carthagena, in Spain. The American squadron then proceeded to  the bay of Algiers, where its sudden and unexpected appearance excited  no slight surprise and alarm in the Regency. The Dey reluctantly  yielded to every demand to him; he restored the value of the property  belonging to American merchants which he had seized, released all the  prisoners he had captured, and relinquished forever all claims on the  annual tribute which he had received. After having thus terminated  the war with Algiers, and formed an advantageous treaty, the  squadron proceeded to other Barbary capitals, and adjusted some minor  difficulties, which, however, were of importance to our merchants.  After touching at several of the islands in the Mediterranean, at  Naples, and at Malaga, the entire force came back to the United States  early in December. From this period till his death, no event of  much importance distinguished the career of Commodore Jones. He was,  however, almost constantly employed in various responsible positions,  his appointment to which evinced the confidence government placed  in his talents and discretion. In 1821, he took the command of a  squadron, for the protection of our trade in the Mediterranean, in  which he continued for three years. On his return he was offered a  seat in the Board of Navy Commissioners, but, finding bureau duties  irksome, he accepted, in 1826, the command of our navy in the  Pacific, where he also continued three years, Afterward he was placed  in command of the Baltimore station, where he remained, with the  exception of a short interval, until transferred to the harbor of  New York. Since 1847, he had held the place of Governor of the United  States Naval Asylum, on the Schuylkill, near Philadelphia.           *       *       *       *       *    JULIA BETTERTON GLOVER.    An actress who has been admired and respected by three generations of  play-goers has quitted the stage of life in the person of Mrs. Glover.  The final exit was somewhat sudden, as it seemed to the general  public; but it was anticipated by her friends. A friendly biographer  in the _Morning Chronicle_ explains the circumstances; first referring  to the extraordinary manifestations of public feeling which attended  Mrs. Glover's last farewell, at Drury-Lane Theater, on Friday, the  12th of July.    \"In our capacity of spectators we did not then see occasion to mention  what had otherwise come to our knowledge--that the evidences of  extreme suffering manifested by Mrs. Glover on that evening--her  inability to go through her part, except as a mere shadow of her  former self, and the substitution of an apologetic speech from Mr.  Leigh Murray for the address which had been written for her by a  well-known and talented amateur of the drama--arose not merely from  the emotion natural on a farewell night, after more than half a  century of active public service, but also from extreme physical  debility, the result of an attack of illness of a wasting character,  which had already confined that venerable lady to her bed for many  days. In fact, it was only the determination of Mrs. Glover herself  not to disappoint the audience, who had been invited and attracted for  many weeks before, that overruled the remonstrances of her friends  and family against her appearing at all. She was then utterly unfit  to appear on the stage in her professional character, and the most  serious alarm was felt lest there should be some sudden and fatal  catastrophe. The result of the struggle of feeling she then underwent,  superadded as it was to the physical causes which had undermined her  strength, was, that Mrs. Glover sunk under the disease which had been  consuming her, and quitted this life on Monday night.\"    Mrs. Glover, born Julia Betterton, was daughter of an actor named  Betterton, who held a good position on the London stage toward  the close of the last century. She is said to have been a lineal  descendant of the great actor of the same name. Her birthday was  the 8th January, 1781. Brought up, as most of our great actors and  actresses have been, \"at the wings,\" she was even in infancy sent on  the stage in children's parts. She became attached to the company of  Tate Wilkinson, for whom she played, at York, the part of the _Page_  in _The Orphan_; and she also exercised her juvenile talents in the  part of _Tom Thumb_, for the benefit of George Frederick Cooke, who on  the occasion doffed his tragic garb and appeared in the character of  _Glumdalcar_. Another character which she played successfully with  Cooke was that of the little _Duke of York_ in _Richard the Third_;  into which, it is recorded, she threw a degree of spirit and childish  roguishness that acted as a spur on the great tragedian himself, who  never performed better than when seconded by his childish associate.

A few months ago Wordsworth was taken from us at the ripe age of  fourscore, yet here we have him addressing the public, as for the  first time, with all the fervor, the unworn freshness, the hopeful  confidence of thirty. We are carried back to the period when  Coleridge, Byron, Scott, Rogers, and Moore were in their youthful  prime. We live again in the stirring days when the poets who divided  public attention and interest with the Fabian struggle in Portugal and  Spain, with the wild and terrible events of the Russian campaign, with  the uprising of the Teutonic nations and the overthrow of Napoleon,  were in a manner but commencing their cycle of songs. This is to  renew, to antedate, the youth of a majority of the living generation.  But only those whose memory still carries them so far back, can feel  within them any reflex of that eager excitement with which the news of  battles fought and won, or mailcoach copies of some new work of Scott,  or Byron, or the _Edinburgh Review_, were looked for and received in  those already old days.    [Footnote 3: The Prelude, or Growth of a Poet's Mind; an  Autobiographical Poem. By William Wordsworth. London, Moxon. [New  York, Appletons.]]    We need not remind the readers of the _Excursion_ that when Wordsworth  was enabled by the generous enthusiasm of Raisley Calvert to retire  with a slender independence to his native mountains, there to devote  himself exclusively to his art, his first step was to review and  record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers, as far  as he was acquainted with them. This was at once an exercise in  versification, and a test for the kind of poetry for which he was  by temperament fitted. The result was a determination to compose a  philosophical poem containing views of man, of nature, and of society.  This, ambitious conception has been doomed to share the fate of so  many other colossal undertakings. Of the three parts of his _Recluse_,  thus planned, only the second, (the _Excursion_, published in 1814,)  has been completed. Of the other two there exists only the first book  of the first, and the plan of the third. The _Recluse_ will remain in  fragmentary greatness, a poetical Cathedral of Cologne.    Matters standing thus, it has not been without a melancholy sense of  the uncertainty of human projects, and of the contrast between the  sanguine enterprise and its silent evaporation (so often the \"history  of an individual mind\"), that we have perused this _Prelude_ which no  completed strain was destined to follow. Yet in the poem itself there  is nothing to inspire depression. It is animated throughout with the  hopeful confidence in the poet's own powers, so natural to the time  of life at which it was composed; it evinces a power and soar of  imagination unsurpassed in any of his writings; and its images and  incidents have a freshness and distinctness which they not seldom  lost, when they came to be elaborated, as many of them were, in his  minor poems of a later date.    The _Prelude_, as the title-page indicates, is a poetical  autobiography, commencing with the earliest reminiscences of the  author, and continued to the time at which it was composed. We are  told that it was begun in 1799 and completed, in 1805. It consists  of fourteen books. Two are devoted to the infancy and school-time of  the poet; four to the period of his University life; two to a brief  residence in London immediately subsequent to his leaving Cambridge,  and a retrospect of the progress his mind had then made; and three  to a residence in France, chiefly in the Loire, but partly in Paris,  during the stormy period of Louis the Sixteenth's flight and capture,  and the fierce contest between the Girondins and Robespierre. Five  books are then occupied with an analysis of the internal struggle  occasioned by the contradictory influences of rural and secluded  nature in boyhood, and of society when the young man first mingles  with the world. The surcease of the strife is recorded in the  fourteenth book, entitled \"Conclusion.\"    The poem is addressed to Coleridge; and apart from its poetical  merits, is interesting as at once a counterpart and a supplement to  that author's philosophical and beautiful criticism of the _Lyrical  Ballads_ in his _Biographia Literaria_. It completes the explanation,  there given, of the peculiar constitution of Wordsworth's mind, and of  his poetical theory. It confirms and justifies our opinion that that  theory was essentially partial and erroneous; but at the same time it  establishes the fact that Wordsworth was a true and a great poet in  despite of his theory.    The great defect of Wordsworth, in our judgment, was want of sympathy  with and knowledge of men. From his birth till his entry at college,  he lived in a region where he met with none whose minds might awaken  his sympathies, and where life was altogether uneventful. On the  other hand, that region abounded with the inert, striking, and most  impressive objects of natural scenery. The elementary grandeur  and beauty of external nature came thus to fill up his mind to  the exclusion of human interests. To such a result his individual  constitution powerfully contributed. The sensuous element was  singularly deficient in his nature. He never seems to have passed  through that erotic period out of which some poets have never emerged.  A soaring, speculative imagination, and an impetuous, resistless  self-will, were his distinguishing characteristics. From first to last  he concentrated himself within himself; brooding over his own fancies  and imaginations to the comparative disregard of the incidents and  impressions which suggested them; and was little susceptible of ideas  originating in other minds. We behold the result. He lives alone in a  world of mountains, streams, and atmospheric phenomena, dealing with  moral abstractions, and rarely encountered by even shadowy specters  of beings outwardly resembling himself. There is measureless grandeur  and power in his moral speculations. There is intense reality in  his pictures of external nature. But though his human characters are  presented with great skill of metaphysical analysis, they have rarely  life or animation. He is always the prominent, often the exclusive,  object of his own song.    Upon a mind so constituted, with its psychological peculiarities  so cherished and confirmed, the fortunes and fates of others, and  the stirring events of his time, made vivid but very transient  impressions.
