Or the  relations and sons of many other excellent men, whose names there is no  occasion to mention? But what are we doing? Have we forgotten that our  purpose was, when we had sufficiently spoken on the subject of the  immortality of the soul, to prove that, even if the soul did perish,  there would be, even then, no evil in death?    _A._ I remembered it very well; but I had no dislike to your digressing  a little from your original design, while you were talking of the  soul's immortality.    _M._ I perceive you have sublime thoughts, and are eager to mount up to  heaven.    XXXIV. I am not without hopes myself that such may be our fate. But  admit what they assert--that the soul does not continue to exist after  death.    _A._ Should it be so, I see that we are then deprived of the hopes of a  happier life.    _M._ But what is there of evil in that opinion? For let the soul perish  as the body: is there any pain, or indeed any feeling at all, in the  body after death? No one, indeed asserts that; though Epicurus charges  Democritus with saying so; but the disciples of Democritus deny it. No  sense, therefore, remains in the soul; for the soul is nowhere. Where,  then, is the evil? for there is nothing but these two things. Is it  because the mere separation of the soul and body cannot be effected  without pain? But even should that be granted, how small a pain must  that be! Yet I think that it is false, and that it is very often  unaccompanied by any sensation at all, and sometimes even attended with  pleasure; but certainly the whole must be very trifling, whatever it  is, for it is instantaneous. What makes us uneasy, or rather gives us  pain, is the leaving all the good things of life. But just consider if  I might not more properly say, leaving the evils of life; only there is  no reason for my now occupying myself in bewailing the life of man, and  yet I might, with very good reason. But what occasion is there, when  what I am laboring to prove is that no one is miserable after death, to  make life more miserable by lamenting over it? I have done that in the  book which I wrote, in order to comfort myself as well as I could. If,  then, our inquiry is after truth, death withdraws us from evil, not  from good. This subject is indeed so copiously handled by Hegesias, the  Cyrenaic philosopher, that he is said to have been forbidden by Ptolemy  from delivering his lectures in the schools, because some who heard him  made away with themselves. There is, too, an epigram of Callimachus[20]  on Cleombrotus of Ambracia, who, without any misfortune having befallen  him, as he says, threw himself from a wall into the sea, after he had  read a book of Plato's. The book I mentioned of that Hegesias is called  [Greek: Apokarterteron], or \"A Man who starves himself,\" in which a man  is represented as killing himself by starvation, till he is prevented  by his friends, in reply to whom he reckons up all the miseries of  human life. I might do the same, though not so fully as he, who thinks  it not worth any man's while to live. I pass over others. Was it even  worth my while to live, for, had I died before I was deprived of the  comforts of my own family, and of the honors which I received for my  public services, would not death have taken me from the evils of life  rather than from its blessings?    XXXV. Mention, therefore, some one, who never knew distress; who never  received any blow from fortune. The great Metellus had four  distinguished sons; but Priam had fifty, seventeen of whom were born to  him by his lawful wife. Fortune had the same power over both, though  she exercised it but on one; for Metellus was laid on his funeral pile  by a great company of sons and daughters, grandsons, and  granddaughters; but Priam fell by the hand of an enemy, after having  fled to the altar, and having seen himself deprived of all his numerous  progeny. Had he died before the death of his sons and the ruin of his  kingdom,        With all his mighty wealth elate,      Under rich canopies of state;    would he then have been taken from good or from evil? It would indeed,  at that time, have appeared that he was being taken away from good; yet  surely it would have turned out advantageous for him; nor should we  have had these mournful verses,        Lo! these all perish'd in one flaming pile;      The foe old Priam did of life beguile,      And with his blood, thy altar, Jove, defile.    As if anything better could have happened to him at that time than to  lose his life in that manner; but yet, if it had befallen him sooner,  it would have prevented all those consequences; but even as it was, it  released him from any further sense of them. The case of our friend  Pompey[21] was something better: once, when he had been very ill at  Naples, the Neapolitans, on his recovery, put crowns on their heads, as  did those of Puteoli; the people flocked from the country to  congratulate him--it is a Grecian custom, and a foolish one; still it  is a sign of good fortune. But the question is, had he died, would he  have been taken from good, or from evil? Certainly from evil. He would  not have been engaged in a war with his father-in-law;[22] he would not  have taken up arms before he was prepared; he would not have left his  own house, nor fled from Italy; he would not, after the loss of his  army, have fallen unarmed into the hands of slaves, and been put to  death by them; his children would not have been destroyed; nor would  his whole fortune have come into the possession of the conquerors. Did  not he, then, who, if he had died at that time, would have died in all  his glory, owe all the great and terrible misfortunes into which he  subsequently fell to the prolongation of his life at that time?    XXXVI. These calamities are avoided by death, for even though they  should never happen, there is a possibility that they may; but it never  occurs to a man that such a disaster may befall him himself. Every one  hopes to be as happy as Metellus: as if the number of the happy  exceeded that of the miserable; or as if there were any certainty in  human affairs; or, again, as if there were more rational foundation for  hope than fear. But should we grant them even this, that men are by  death deprived of good things; would it follow that the dead are  therefore in need of the good things of life, and are miserable on that  account? Certainly they must necessarily say so. Can he who does not  exist be in need of anything? To be in need of has a melancholy sound,  because it in effect amounts to this--he had, but he has not; he  regrets, he looks back upon, he wants. Such are, I suppose, the  distresses of one who is in need of. Is he deprived of eyes? to be  blind is misery. Is he destitute of children? not to have them is  misery. These considerations apply to the living, but the dead are  neither in need of the blessings of life, nor of life itself. But when  I am speaking of the dead, I am speaking of those who have no  existence. But would any one say of us, who do exist, that we want  horns or wings? Certainly not. Should it be asked, why not? the answer  would be, that not to have what neither custom nor nature has fitted  you for would not imply a want of them, even though you were sensible  that you had them not. This argument should be pressed over and over  again, after that point has once been established, which, if souls are  mortal, there can be no dispute about--I mean, that the destruction of  them by death is so entire as to remove even the least suspicion of any  sense remaining. When, therefore, this point is once well grounded and  established, we must correctly define what the term to want means; that  there may be no mistake in the word. To want, then, signifies this: to  be without that which you would be glad to have; for inclination for a  thing is implied in the word want, excepting when we use the word in an  entirely different sense, as we do when we say that a fever is wanting  to any one. For it admits of a different interpretation, when you are  without a certain thing, and are sensible that you are without it, but  yet can easily dispense with having it. \"To want,\" then, is an  expression which you cannot apply to the dead; nor is the mere fact of  wanting something necessarily lamentable. The proper expression ought  to be, \"that they want a good,\" and that is an evil.    But a living man does not want a good, unless he is distressed without  it; and yet, we can easily understand how any man alive can be without  a kingdom. But this cannot be predicated of you with any accuracy: it  might have been asserted of Tarquin, when he was driven from his  kingdom. But when such an expression is used respecting the dead, it is  absolutely unintelligible. For to want implies to be sensible; but the  dead are insensible: therefore, the dead can be in no want.    XXXVII. But what occasion is there to philosophize here in a matter  with which we see that philosophy is but little concerned? How often  have not only our generals but whole armies, rushed on certain death!  But if it had been a thing to be feared, L. Brutus would never have  fallen in fight, to prevent the return of that tyrant whom he had  expelled; nor would Decius the father have been slain in fighting with  the Latins; nor would his son, when engaged with the Etruscans, nor his  grandson with Pyrrhus have exposed themselves to the enemy's darts.  Spain would never have seen, in one campaign, the Scipios fall fighting  for their country; nor would the plains of Cannae have witnessed the  death of Paulus and Geminus, or Venusia that of Marcellus; nor would  the Latins have beheld the death of Albinus, nor the Leucanians that of  Gracchus. But are any of these miserable now?

The metal simply rips up, making a report  at the moment of fracture as loud as a gun. The wonderful strength of  the metal employed may be gauged by the circumstance that the walls of  the cylinder designed to hold 100 feet of gas are only five-sixteenths  of an inch in thickness.    During the manufacture of the cylinder, as we have already indicated,  much oil is used, and, so far as steel can be saturated with that  fluid--in the popular sense--the metal is in that state. It is  essential that this oil should be completely got rid of, and this is  carefully done before the cylinder is charged with gas. Previous to  such charging, the vessel has to be fitted with its valve. Of these  valves there are three kinds, known respectively as the Brin, the  Birmingham, and the Manchester. Each has its admirers, but we cannot  here discuss their individual merits.    The charging of the cylinder is brought about by a powerful pump  having three cylinders so arranged that the compressed contents of the  first cylinder are still further compressed in the second, and still  more highly in the third. The filling of a 100 ft. cylinder occupies  about half an hour.--_Photographic News_.           *       *       *       *       *          HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HORSESHOE.

The horse appeared comparatively late in the group of domestic  animals. In searching the monuments of the ancients, which have  furnished the foundation for our present culture, that is, of the  littoral inhabitants of the Mediterranean, and of the people of  Mesopotamia, we find in Egypt the first traces of the horse. But even  here it appears late, on the monuments of the first ruling patricians  of human origin.[2] Especially during the period of Memphis (I-X  Dynasty), then under the rules of Thebes (XI-XVI Dynasty), there is no  trace of the horse.       [Footnote 2: Until the time Menes, with whom historical times     begin, ruled in Egypt among visionary heroes or mythological     gods.]    It is first in the transition period, from the late rule of Thebes  (XVII-XX Dynasty) to the so-called period of Sut (XXI-XXX Dynasty)  that there appears, in the wall pictures of the Pharaohs' tombs,  representations of the horse. The oldest, now known, picture of the  horse is found on the walls of the tombs of Seti I. (1458-1507 B.C.)  under whose reign the Israelite wandered from Egypt. The horses of the  mortuary pictures are very well drawn, and have an unmistakable  oriental type. There has therefore undoubtedly existed in Egypt high  culture, for over 4,000 years, without representation of the horse,  which was the next animal domesticated after the cat.    From this time on we find the horse frequently represented both by the  vainglorious despots of Mesopotamia and on the so-called Etruscan  vases, which appeared after the influence of Greek art, when, on  almost every urn, horses in lively action and in various forms of  bodily development, almost always of an oriental type, are to be  recognized. But neither here, nor in Homer, nor in the many later  representations of the horse on the Roman triumphal arches, etc., are  to be found horses whose hoofs have any trace of protection. Records,  which describe to us the misfortunes of armies, whose horses had run  their feet sore, we find on the contrary at a very early time, as in  Diodorus, regarding the cavalry of Alexander the Great, in Xenophon,  regarding the retreat of the ten thousand, in Polybius, regarding the  cavalry of Hannibal in Etruria, etc. It is also known that the cavalry  of the linguist King of Pontus, Mithridates the Great, at times and  specially at the siege of Cyzicus were delayed, in order to let the  hoofs of the horses grow.    On the contrary it seems strange that of the Huns alone, whose  horsemen swept over whole continents from the Asiatic highlands like a  thunderstorm, such trouble had not become known either through the  numerous authors of the eastern and western Roman empire or from  Gallia.    Horseshoeing, very likely, was invented by different nations at about  the same period during the migration of the nations, and the various  kinds of new inventions were brought together in Germany only, after  each had acquired a national stamp according to climate and  usefulness.    In this way come from the south the thin, plate-like horseshoes, with  staved rim, covering the whole hoof; from the Mongolian tribes of  middle Asia the \"Stolleneisen\" (calk shoe); while to our northern  ancestors, and indeed the Normans, must be ascribed with great  probability the invention of the \"Griffeneisen\" (gripe shoe),  especially for the protection of the toes.    All varieties of the horseshoe of southern Europe are easily  distinguished from the Roman so-called \"Kureisen\" (cure shoe), of  which several have been unearthed at various excavations and are  preserved at the Romo-Germanic Museum in Mentz (Mainz), Germany. The  shoes, Figs. 1 and 2, each represent thin iron plates, covering the  whole hoof, which in some cases have an opening in the middle, of  several centimeters in diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    These plates, apparently set forth to suit oriental and occidental  body conformation, are either directly provided with loops or have  around the outer margin a brim several centimeters high, in which  rings are fastened. Through the loops or rings small ropes were drawn,  and in this way the shoe was fastened to the crown of the hoof and to  the pastern. Sufficient securing of the toe was wanting in all these  shoes, and, on account of this, the movement of the animal with the  same must have been very clumsy, and we can see from this that the  ropes must have made the crown of the hoof and pastern sore in a short  time. One of these shoes[3] evidently was the object of improvement,  to prevent the animal from slipping as well as from friction, and we  therefore find on it three iron cubes 11/2 centimeters high, which were  fastened corresponding to our toes and calks of to-day, and offer a  very early ready proof, from our climatic and mountainous conditions,  which later occur, principally in southern Germany, that this style of  horseshoeing was not caused by error, but by a well founded local and  national interest or want.       [Footnote 3: Not illustrated.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Aside from the so-called \"Kureisen\" (cure shoe) for diseased hoofs, we  find very little from the Romans on horseshoeing or hoof protection,  and therefore we must observe special precautions with all their  literature on the subject. It is because of this that I excuse Prof.  Sittl's communication in the preface of Winckelmann's \"Geschichte der  Kunst in Alterthum\" (History of Ancient Art), which contains a notice  that Fabretti, in some raised work in Plazzo Matti, of a  representation of a hunt by the Emperor Gallienus (Bartoli Admirand  Ant. Tab. 24), showed that at that time horseshoes fastened by nails,  the same as to-day, were used (Fabretti de Column. Traj. C. 7 pag.  225; Conf. Montlanc. Antiq. Explic. T. 4, pag. 79). This statement  proves itself erroneous, because he was not aware that the foot of the  horse was repaired by an inexperienced sculptor.    How then did out of this Roman cure shoe develop the horseshoeing of  southern Europe?    It was to be expected, with the Roman horseshoe, that the mode of  fastening became unsatisfactory and necessitated a remedy or change.  An attempt of this kind has been preserved in the so-called  \"Asiatischen Koppeneisensole\" (Asiatic cap-iron-sole) (Fig. 3), which  the Hon. Mr. Lydtin at Karlsruhe had made according to a model of the  Circassian Horse Tribe Shaloks, and also according to the reverse of  Lycian coins (called Triguetra).    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    This horseshoe plate, likely originating in the twelfth century,  covers the whole surface of the sole, like the Roman shoes, with the  exception of the wall region, which contains a rim 1 centimeter high,  and above this rises at one side toward the heel three beak-like  projections, about 4 centimeters high and 1 centimeter wide at the  base, being pointed above and turned down, which were fastened in the  wall of the hoof, in the form of a hook.    This mode of fastening evidently was also insufficient, and so the  fastening of the shoe by nails was adopted. These iron plates used for  shoes were too thin to allow nails with sunken heads to be used, so  only nails with blades and cubical shaped heads were applicable. These  nail heads, 6 to 8 in number, which left the toe and the back part of  the heel free, served at the same time to secure the horse from  slipping, which the smooth plates, covering the whole hoof surface,  without doubt facilitated.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    Shoes of this kind, after the old Roman style, with a very strong rim  bent upward, likely proved very comfortable for the purpose of  protection, in the"]]]
