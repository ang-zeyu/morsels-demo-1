Hansel stooped down, and put as many into  his pocket as it would hold; and then going back he said to Grethel,  \"Be of good cheer, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will not  forsake us.\" And so saying, he went to bed again.    The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the  two children. \"Get up, you lazy things; we are going into the forest  to chop wood.\" Then she gave them each a piece of bread, saying,  \"There is something for your dinner; do not eat it before the time,  for you will get nothing else.\" Grethel took the bread in her apron,  for Hansel's pocket was full of pebbles; and so they all set out upon  their way. When they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still,  and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till  his father said, \"Hansel, what are you looking at, and why do you lag  behind? Take care, and remember your legs.\"    \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my white cat sitting upon  the roof of the house, and trying to say good-bye.\"    \"You simpleton!\" said the wife, \"that is not a cat; it is only the sun  shining on the white chimney.\" But in reality Hansel was not looking  at a cat; but every time he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his  pocket upon the path.    When they came to the middle of the forest, the father told the  children to collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so that they  should not be cold. So Hansel and Grethel gathered together quite a  little mount of twigs. Then they set fire to them; and as the flame  burnt up high, the wife said, \"Now, you children, lie down near the  fire, and rest yourselves, whilst we go into the forest and chop more  wood; when we are ready we will come and call you.\"    Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon, each  ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an  axe they thought their father was near; but it was not an axe, but a  branch which he had bound to an old tree, so as to be blown to and fro  by the wind. They waited so long, that at last their eyes closed from  weariness, and they fell fast asleep. When they awoke, it was quite  dark, and Grethel began to cry. \"How shall we get out of the wood?\"  But Hansel tried to comfort her by saying, \"Wait a little while till  the moon rises, and then we will quickly find the way.\" The moon shone  forth, and Hansel, taking his sister's hand, followed the pebbles,  which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and showed them the  way. All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came to  their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife  opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, \"You wicked  children! Why did you sleep so long in the wood? We thought you were  never coming home again.\" But their father was extremely glad, for it  had grieved his heart to leave them all alone.    [Illustration: \"HANSEL AND GRETHEL SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE.\"]    Not long afterwards there was again great scarcity in every corner of  the land; and one night the children overheard their mother saying to  their father, \"Everything is once more consumed; we have only half a  loaf left, and then the song is ended: the children must be sent away.  We will take them deeper into the wood, so that they may not find the  way out again; it is the only means of escape for us.\"    But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, \"It were better  to share the last crust with the children.\" His wife, however, would  listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and reproached him without  end.    He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first time must  also the second.    The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake,  and as soon as their parents went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to  pick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, so  that he could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying,  \"Do not weep; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us.\"    Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed,  and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than the  former piece. On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and stopping  every now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path. \"Hansel, why do  you stop and look about?\" said the father, \"keep in the path.\" \"I am  looking at my little dove,\" answered Hansel, \"nodding a good-bye to  me.\" \"Simpleton!\" said the wife, \"that is no dove, but only the sun  shining on the chimney.\" But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he  went along.    The mother led the children deep into the wood, where they had never  been before, and there making a gigantic fire, she said to them, \"Sit  down here and rest, and when you feel tired you can sleep for a little  while. We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening,  when we are ready, we will come and fetch you again.\"    When noon came, Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn  his on the path. They then went to sleep; but the evening arrived and  no one came to visit the poor children, and in the dark night they  awoke, and Hansel comforted his sister by saying, \"Only wait, Grethel,  till the moon comes out, then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I  have dropped, and they will show us the way home.\" The moon shone and  they got up, but they could not see any crumbs, for the thousands of  birds which had been flying about in the woods and fields had picked  them all up. Hansel kept saying to Grethel, \"We will soon find the  way;\" but they did not, and they walked the whole night long and the  next day, but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got  very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they  found upon the bushes. Soon they were so tired that they could not  drag themselves along, then they lay down under a tree and again went  to sleep.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  HANSEL AND GRETHEL]    It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house,  and they still walked on; but they only got deeper, and deeper, and  deeper into the wood, and Hansel felt that if help did not come  very soon they must die of hunger. As soon as it was noon they saw a  beautiful, snow-white bird sitting upon a bough, singing so sweetly  that they stood still and listened to it. It soon ceased, and  spreading its wings flew off; and they followed it until it arrived at  a cottage, upon the roof of which it perched; and when they went close  up to it they saw that the cottage was made of bread and cakes, and  the window-panes were of clear sugar.    \"We will go in here,\" said Hansel, \"and have a glorious feast. I will  eat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window. Will they not be  sweet?\" So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in order  to see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and  began to bite it. Then a sweet voice called out in the room, \"Tip-tap,  tip-tap, who knocks at my door?\" and the children answered, \"The  wind, the wind, the child of heaven;\" and they went on eating without  interruption. Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he tore  off a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of the  window, and sat down quite contentedly. Just then the door opened, and  a very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out. Hansel and Grethel  were so much frightened that they let fall what they had in their  hands; but the old woman nodding her head, said, \"Ah, you dear  children, what has brought you here? Come in and stop with me, and no  harm shall come to you;\" and so saying she took them both by the hand,  and led them into her cottage. A good meal of milk and pancakes, with  sugar, apples and nuts, was spread on the table, and in the back  room were two nice little beds, covered with white, where Hansel and  Grethel laid themselves down, and were happy as could be. The old  woman behaved very kindly to them, but in reality she was a wicked  old witch who way-laid children, and built the breadhouse in order to  entice them in; but as soon as they were in her power she killed them,  cooked and ate them, and made a great festival of the day. Witches  have red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of  smelling, like wild beasts, so that they know when children approach  them. When Hansel and Grethel came near the witch's house she laughed  wickedly, saying, \"Here come two who shall not escape me.\" And early  in the morning, before they awoke, she went up to them, and saw how  lovingly they lay sleeping, with their chubby red cheeks; and she  mumbled to herself, \"That will be a good bite.\" Then she took up  Hansel with her rough hand, and shut him up in a little cage with  a lattice-door; and although he screamed loudly it was of no use.  Grethel came next, and shaking her till she awoke, she said, \"Get up,  you lazy brat, and fetch some water to cook something good for your  brother, who must remain in that stall and get fat; and when he is fat  enough I shall eat him.\" Grethel began to cry, but it was all useless,  for the old witch made her do as she wanted. So a nice meal was cooked  for Hansel, but Grethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.    Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, \"Hansel,  stretch out your finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat.\"  But Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very  bad sight, thought it was his finger, and wondered very much why he  did not get fat. When four weeks had passed, and Hansel still kept  quite lean, she lost all her patience, and would not wait any longer.  \"Grethel,\" she cried in a passion, \"get some water quickly; be Hansel  fat or lean, this morning I will kill and cook him.\" Oh, how the poor  little sister "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15147"],[0,"Beeton's Book of Needlework (#9)"],[1,"similar  leaves, work one corner leaf, and continue the pattern in the same  manner until you come back to the first corner leaf, then fasten off,  and cut the cotton. Place the diamond pattern upon the point of the  collar, and cut away the material under it; fold back the edges, sew  them neatly, and cover them with the following crochet edging:--Make  alternately 2 chain, 1 purl (the latter composed of 3 chain joined  together by 1 slip stitch). It will be easy to work the circles in  tatting from our illustration; they form an elegant border round the  collar. We shall merely say that the centre circle is always worked  separately, and that the cotton is fastened on afresh to work the eight  outer leaves. The upper edge of this border is worked in crochet. It is  composed of two rows--one formed of chain stitches, and a few slip  stitches worked in the purl of the circles in tatting, the other worked  in open treble crochet.           *       *       *       *       *    50.--_Cravat in Cambric Muslin and Tatting._    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 100;  tatting-pin No. 3.    This cravat consists of a strip of cambric muslin 1 yard long, 6 inches  wide, hemmed on both sides. The ends of the cravat are ornamented with  patterns in tatting, worked with tatting cotton No. 100. A rosette in  tatting is sewn on in the middle of the end of the cravat. The end of  the cravat is pointed, lined on the wrong side with a strip of the same  material as the cravat, and edged with a tatted lace. Begin the rosette  in the centre with a circle worked in the following manner:--1 double, 1  purl, * twice 2 double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl,  twice 4 double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl, * 3 double, 1 purl; repeat  from * to * once more, 2 double. At the beginning of the 2nd round  fasten the cotton on the 1st purl of the 1st round, and    [Illustration: 50.--Cravat in Muslin and Tatting.]    work as follows:--* 1 circle consisting of 10 double, 1 purl, 2 double,  1 purl, 10 double; fasten the cotton on to the next purl, 1 circle like  the preceding one, fastened on to the next purl, 1 circle consisting of  9 double, 1 purl, 9 double fastened on to the next purl, 2 circles  consisting each of 7 double, 1 purl, 7 double; between the 2 fasten the  cotton on to the next purl; 2 similar circles fastened also on to the  next purl, 1 circle consisting of 8 double, 1 purl, 8 double, fastened  on to the next circle; repeat once more from *, and fasten off the  cotton. Fasten on the cotton afresh for the 3rd round, worked in the  following manner:--* 1 circle consisting of 6 double, 1 purl, 5 double,  1 purl, 6 times 2 double divided by 1 purl; 1 purl, 5 double, 1 purl, 6  double; fasten the cotton at a short distance on to the 1st purl of the  2nd round, 1 circle worked as follows:--5 double fastened on to the last  purl of the preceding circle of this round, 4 double, 1 purl, 4 times 2  double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 5 double fastened on  to the next purl of the 2nd circle of the 2nd round; 6 similar circles,  between each of which the cotton is to be fastened on to the nearest  purl of a circle of the 2nd round; repeat once more from *, and knot the  beginning and the end of the cotton together. When completed, the  rosette is sewn on the material of the cravat with button-hole stitches,  taking up one purl with each stitch; the muslin is cut away underneath  the rosette; then work a round of knotted stitches underneath the  button-hole stitch. For the lace, make a row of circles one-fifth of an  inch distant from each other, consisting each of 6 double, 1 purl, 2  double, 1 purl, 4 times 2 double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl, 2 double, 1  purl, 6 double, which are fastened together by the purl of each circle,  and are sewn on the cravat over the cotton between the circles in  overcast stitch.           *       *       *       *       *    51--_Cravat in Cambric Muslin and Tatting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 100;  tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 51.--Cravat in Muslin and Tatting.]    The end of this cravat is formed by a long rosette or _medaillon_ in  tatting. This rosette is likewise begun in the centre, and consists of 4  rounds, the 2 first of which are worked like those of the rosette in  illustration 50, with this difference only, that in the 2nd round each  of the circles nearest to the top and to the bottom of the rosette  consists of 8 double, 1 purl, 2 double, 1 purl, 8 double. 3rd round: * 1  circle, consisting of 6 double, 1 purl, 5 double, 1 purl, 6 times 2  double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl, 5 double, 1 purl, 6 double, fastened  on to the next purl of the 2nd circle of the preceding round; 1 circle  as follows:--5 double, the last of which is fastened on to the last purl  of the preceding round, 4 double, 1 purl, twice 2 double divided by 1  purl, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 5 double fastened on the next purl of  the preceding round; 8 more similar circles, between each of which the  cotton is fastened on to the next purl of the preceding round; repeat  from * once more, fasten the two ends of the cotton together. 4th round:  * Fasten on the cotton afresh with a circle consisting of 7 double, 1  purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 6 times 2 double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl, 4  double, 1 purl, 7 double, fastened on to the middle purl of the 1st  circle of the preceding round; a 2nd circle worked in the same way, only  instead of working the last purl, fasten the cotton on to the last purl  of the preceding circle, then on to the 1st circle of the preceding  round; 10 more similar circles, between each of which the cotton is  fastened on to the middle purl of a circle of the preceding round, and  then on to the 2nd purl of the larger circle at the bottom of the  medallion; repeat once more from *. The pattern is sewn on the cravat  with button-hole stitches, as can be seen in the illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    52.--_Border in Crochet and Tatting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Boar's Head cotton No. 26.    This border is formed of circles in tatting and crochet leaves, which  are joined together by rows of crochet work; a narrow    [Illustration: 52.--Border in Crochet and Tatting.]    border in tatting forms the lower edge. Omitting this edge, the border  forms a strip of insertion. Each of the rosettes or circles is begun in  the centre; work first 2 double (a double stitch is formed by passing  the thread over the back of the hand, and then passing the shuttle  upwards between the forefinger and second finger, and drawing it up,  then work a stitch of plain tatting; this completes the double stitch,  and whenever so many double stitches are directed it means the 2  stitches), 1 purl, repeat 9 times, join the stitch into a circle, work  at a small distance * a smaller ring consisting of 3 double, 5 purl,  divided each by 2 double stitches, 4 double, draw the cotton through the  purl of the first circle, and repeat 8 times more from *, only each  following circle must be fastened on to a purl of the preceding circle  after 3 double stitches, and having completed each circle the thread  must be drawn through the purl of the first circle, which forms the  centre of the rosette. The beginning and the end of the thread are  knotted together. For the tatted border, make at short distances 1 loop  with 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double; after having worked a sufficient number  of such loops, wind another thread round the thread between the loops,  turning always 1 loop on the right side and 1 on the left. Now begin the  crochet part with the leaves. Make for each of these a foundation chain  of 12 stitches, crochet back over this chain 2 double in the last stitch  but one, 1 double in the next stitch, 1 treble in each of the following  7 chain, 2 treble in the next stitch, 2 treble, 1 long treble, and 2  treble in the next following stitch of the foundation chain. Work on the  other side of the chain the same pattern, only the reverse way; then 3  double in the point of the leaf thus formed, and edge the whole leaf  with a round of double stitches, always working 2 double in each stitch  of the preceding row, and 3 in the long treble stitch. In working this  last round, the circles must be joined to the leaves by taking up the  purl stitch of the circle before casting off the corresponding double  stitch of the leaf; then work the stem which joins the 2 rows of circles  and leaves with a row of chain stitches, on which a row of double is  worked. Then comes the border which forms the upper edge. Make a row of  chain stitches, joining leaves and circles together, then work 3 rows of  treble, work 3 more rows over the tatted border, the first row entirely  in chain stitches, after every fourth stitch take up the purl of the  loops on one side. 2nd row: 1 treble in the middle stitch of the 3  chain, 2 treble, divided by 3 chain. 3rd row: 1 treble, 1 chain, miss 1  under the last. In the last row the leaves and circles must be fastened  on the border, as seen in illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    53.--_Diamond in Tatting_.    Materials: Messrs.
