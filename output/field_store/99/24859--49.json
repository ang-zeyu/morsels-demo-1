The design of  this invention is suggestive of one phase of Abraham Lincoln's early  life, when he went up and down the Mississippi as a flatboatman and  became familiar with some of the dangers and inconveniences attending  the navigation of the western rivers. It is an attempt to make it an  easy matter to transport vessels over shoals and snags and 'sawyers.'  The main idea is that of an apparatus resembling a noiseless bellows  placed on each side of the hull of the craft just below the water line  and worked by an odd but not complicated system of ropes, valves, and  pulleys. When the keel of the vessel grates against the sand or  obstruction these bellows are to be filled with air, and thus buoyed up  the ship is expected to float lightly and gayly over the shoal which  would otherwise have proved a serious interruption to her voyage. The  model, which is about eighteen or twenty inches long and has the  appearance of having been whittled with a knife out of a shingle and a  cigar-box, is built without any elaboration or ornament or any extra  apparatus beyond that necessary to show the operation of buoying the  steamer over the obstructions. It is carved as one might imagine a  retired railsplitter would whittle, strongly but not smoothly, and  evidently made with a view solely to convey to the minds of the patent  authorities, by the simplest possible means, an idea of the purpose and  plan of the invention. The label on the steamer's deck informs us that  the patent was obtained; but we do not learn that the navigation of the  western rivers was revolutionized by this quaint conception. The modest  little model has reposed here for many years, and the inventor has found  it his task to guide the ship of state over shoals more perilous and  obstructions more obstinate than any prophet dreamed of when Abraham  Lincoln wrote his bold autograph across the prow of his miniature  steamer.\"    At the conclusion of his trip to New Orleans, Lincoln's employer, Mr.  Offutt, entered into mercantile trade at New Salem, a settlement on the  Sangamon river, in Menard County, two miles from Petersburg, the county  seat. He opened a store of the class usually to be found in such small  towns, and also set up a flouring-mill. In the late expedition down the  Mississippi Mr. Offutt had learned Lincoln's valuable qualities, and was  anxious to secure his help in his new enterprise. Says Mr. Barrett: \"For  want of other immediate employment, and in the same spirit which had  heretofore actuated him, Abraham Lincoln entered upon the duties of a  clerk, having an eye to both branches of his employer's business. This  connection continued for nearly a year, all duties of his position being  faithfully performed.\" It was to this year's humble but honorable  service of young Lincoln that Mr. Douglas tauntingly alluded in one of  his speeches during the canvass of 1858 as 'keeping a groggery.'    While engaged in the duties of Offutt's store Lincoln began the study of  English grammar. There was not a text-book to be obtained in the  neighborhood; but hearing that there was a copy of Kirkham's Grammar in  the possession of a person seven or eight miles distant he walked to  his house and succeeded in borrowing it. L.M. Green, a lawyer of  Petersburg, in Menard County, says that every time he visited New Salem  at this period Lincoln took him out upon a hill and asked him to explain  some point in Kirkham that had given him trouble. After having mastered  the book he remarked to a friend that if that was what they called a  science he thought he could \"subdue another.\" Mr. Green says that  Lincoln's talk at this time showed that he was beginning to think of a  great life and a great destiny. Lincoln said to him on one occasion that  all his family seemed to have good sense but somehow none had ever  become distinguished. He thought perhaps he might become so. He had  talked, he said, with men who had the reputation of being great men, but  he could not see that they differed much from others. During this year  he was also much engaged with debating clubs, often walking six or seven  miles to attend them. One of these clubs held its meetings at an old  store-house in New Salem, and the first speech young Lincoln ever made  was made there. He used to call the exercising \"practicing polemics.\" As  these clubs were composed principally of men of no education whatever,  some of their \"polemics\" are remembered as the most laughable of farces.  Lincoln's favorite newspaper at this time was the \"Louisville Journal.\"  He received it regularly by mail, and paid for it during a number of  years when he had not money enough to dress decently. He liked its  politics, and was particularly delighted with its wit and humor, of  which he had the keenest appreciation.    At this era Lincoln was as famous for his skill in athletic sports as he  was for his love of books. Mr. Offutt, who had a strong regard for him,  according to Mr. Arnold, \"often declared that his clerk, or salesman,  knew more than any man in the United States, and that he could out-run,  whip, or throw any man in the county. These boasts came to the ears of  the 'Clary Grove Boys,' a set of rude, roystering, good-natured  fellows, who lived in and around Clary's Grove, a settlement near New  Salem. Their leader was Jack Armstrong, a great square-built fellow,  strong as an ox, who was believed by his followers to be able to whip  any man on the Sangamon river. The issue was thus made between Lincoln  and Armstrong as to which was the better man, and although Lincoln tried  to avoid such contests, nothing but an actual trial of strength would  satisfy their partisans. They met and wrestled for some time without any  decided advantage on either side. Finally Armstrong resorted to some  foul play, which roused Lincoln's indignation. Putting forth his whole  strength, he seized the great bully by the neck and holding him at arm's  length shook him like a boy. The Clary Grove Boys were ready to pitch in  on behalf of their champion; and as they were the greater part of the  lookers-on, a general onslaught upon Lincoln seemed imminent. Lincoln  backed up against Offutt's store and calmly awaited the attack; but his  coolness and courage made such an impression upon Armstrong that he  stepped forward, grasped Lincoln's hand and shook it heartily, saying:  'Boys, Abe Lincoln is the best fellow that ever broke into this  settlement. He shall be one of us.' From that day forth Armstrong was  Lincoln's friend and most willing servitor. His hand, his table, his  purse, his vote, and that of the Clary Grove Boys as well, belonged to  Lincoln. The latter's popularity among them was unbounded. They saw that  he would play fair. He could stop a fight and quell a disturbance among  these rude neighbors when all others failed.\"    Under whatever circumstances Lincoln was forced into a fight, the end  could be confidently predicted. He was sure to thrash his opponent and  gain the latter's friendship afterwards by a generous use of victory.  Innumerable instances could be cited in proof of this statement. It is  related that \"One day while showing goods to two or three women in  Offutt's store, a bully came in and began to talk in an offensive  manner, using much profanity and evidently wishing to provoke a quarrel.  Lincoln leaned over the counter and begged him, as ladies were present,  not to indulge in such talk. The bully retorted that the opportunity had  come for which he had long sought, and he would like to see the man who  could hinder him from saying anything he might choose to say. Lincoln,  still cool, told him that if he would wait until the ladies retired he  would hear what he had to say and give him any satisfaction he desired.  As soon as the women were gone the man became furious. Lincoln heard his  boasts and his abuse for a time, and finding that he was not to be put  off without a fight, said, 'Well, if you must be whipped, I suppose I  may as well whip you as any other man.' This was just what the bully had  been seeking, he said; so out of doors they went. Lincoln made short  work of him. He threw him upon the ground, and held him there as if he  had been a child, and gathering some 'smart-weed' which grew upon the  spot he rubbed it into his face and eyes until the fellow bellowed with  pain. Lincoln did all this without a particle of anger, and when the job  was finished went immediately for water, washed his victim's face and  did everything he could to alleviate his distress. The upshot of the  matter was that the man became his life-long friend and was a better man  from that day.\"    The chief repute of a sturdy frontiersman is built upon his deeds of  prowess, and the fame of the great, rough, strong-limbed, kind-hearted  Titan was spread over all the country around. Says Mr. Lamon: \"On one  occasion while he was clerking for Offutt a stranger came into the store  and soon disclosed the fact that his name was Smoot. Abe was behind the  counter at the moment, but hearing the name he sprang over and  introduced himself. Abe had often heard of Smoot and Smoot had often  heard of Abe. They had been as anxious to meet as ever two celebrities  were, but hitherto they had never been able to manage it. 'Smoot,' said  Lincoln, after a steady survey of his person, 'I am very much  disappointed in you; I expected to see an old Probst of a fellow.'  (Probst, it appears, was the most hideous specimen of humanity in all  that country). 'Yes,' replied Smoot, 'and I am equally disappointed, for  I expected to see a good-looking man when I saw you.' A few neat  compliments like the foregoing laid the foundation of a lasting intimacy  between the two men, and in his present distress Lincoln knew no one who  would be more likely than Smoot to respond favorably to an application  for money.\" After he was elected to"]]]
