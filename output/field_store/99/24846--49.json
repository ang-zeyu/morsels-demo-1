I pray you, my venerable brother, let  not this thing be! Suffer us to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect  as you go to your reward. Before the veil of eternity be lifted let me  cast aside this black veil from your face;\" and, thus speaking, the  Reverend Mr. Clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many  years.    But, exerting a sudden energy that made all the beholders stand  aghast, Father Hooper snatched both his hands from beneath the  bedclothes and pressed them strongly on the black veil, resolute to  struggle if the minister of Westbury would contend with a dying man.    \"Never!\" cried the veiled clergyman. \"On earth, never!\"    \"Dark old man,\" exclaimed the affrighted minister, \"with what horrible  crime upon your soul are you now passing to the judgment?\"    Father Hooper's breath heaved: it rattled in his throat; but, with a  mighty effort grasping forward with his hands, he caught hold of life  and held it back till he should speak. He even raised himself in bed,  and there he sat shivering with the arms of Death around him, while  the black veil hung down, awful at that last moment in the gathered  terrors of a lifetime. And yet the faint, sad smile so often there now  seemed to glimmer from its obscurity and linger on Father Hooper's  lips.    \"Why do you tremble at me alone?\" cried he, turning his veiled face  round the circle of pale spectators. \"Tremble also at each other. Have  men avoided me and women shown no pity and children screamed and fled  only for my black veil? What but the mystery which it obscurely  typifies has made this piece of crape so awful? When the friend shows  his inmost heart to his friend, the lover to his best-beloved; when  man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his Creator, loathsomely  treasuring up the secret of his sin,--then deem me a monster for the  symbol beneath which I have lived and die. I look around me, and, lo!  on every visage a black veil!\"    While his auditors shrank from one another in mutual affright, Father  Hooper fell back upon his pillow, a veiled corpse with a faint smile  lingering on the lips. Still veiled, they laid him in his coffin, and  a veiled corpse they bore him to the grave. The grass of many years  has sprung up and withered on that grave, the burial-stone is  moss-grown, and good Mr. Hooper's face is dust; but awful is still the  thought that it mouldered beneath the black veil.          THE MAYPOLE OF MERRY MOUNT.          There is an admirable foundation for a philosophic romance in      the curious history of the early settlement of Mount Wollaston,      or Merry Mount. In the slight sketch here attempted the facts      recorded on the grave pages of our New England annalists have      wrought themselves almost spontaneously into a sort of allegory.      The masques, mummeries and festive customs described in the text      are in accordance with the manners of the age. Authority on these      points may be found in Strutt's _Book of English Sports and      Pastimes_.    Bright were the days at Merry Mount when the Maypole was the  banner-staff of that gay colony. They who reared it, should their  banner be triumphant, were to pour sunshine over New England's rugged  hills and scatter flower-seeds throughout the soil. Jollity and gloom  were contending for an empire. Midsummer eve had come, bringing deep  verdure to the forest, and roses in her lap of a more vivid hue than  the tender buds of spring. But May, or her mirthful spirit, dwelt all  the year round at Merry Mount, sporting with the summer months and  revelling with autumn and basking in the glow of winter's fireside.  Through a world of toil and care she flitted with a dream-like smile,  and came hither to find a home among the lightsome hearts of Merry  Mount.    Never had the Maypole been so gayly decked as at sunset on Midsummer  eve. This venerated emblem was a pine tree which had preserved the  slender grace of youth, while it equalled the loftiest height of the  old wood-monarchs. From its top streamed a silken banner colored like  the rainbow. Down nearly to the ground the pole was dressed with  birchen boughs, and others of the liveliest green, and some with  silvery leaves fastened by ribbons that fluttered in fantastic knots  of twenty different colors, but no sad ones. Garden-flowers and  blossoms of the wilderness laughed gladly forth amid the verdure, so  fresh and dewy that they must have grown by magic on that happy pine  tree. Where this green and flowery splendor terminated the shaft of  the Maypole was stained with the seven brilliant hues of the banner at  its top. On the lowest green bough hung an abundant wreath of  roses--some that had been gathered in the sunniest spots of the  forest, and others, of still richer blush, which the colonists had  reared from English seed. O people of the Golden Age, the chief of  your husbandry was to raise flowers!    But what was the wild throng that stood hand in hand about the  Maypole? It could not be that the fauns and nymphs, when driven from  their classic groves and homes of ancient fable, had sought refuge, as  all the persecuted did, in the fresh woods of the West. These were  Gothic monsters, though perhaps of Grecian ancestry. On the shoulders  of a comely youth uprose the head and branching antlers of a stag; a  second, human in all other points, had the grim visage of a wolf; a  third, still with the trunk and limbs of a mortal man, showed the  beard and horns of a venerable he-goat. There was the likeness of a  bear erect, brute in all but his hind legs, which were adorned with  pink silk stockings. And here, again, almost as wondrous, stood a real  bear of the dark forest, lending each of his forepaws to the grasp of  a human hand and as ready for the dance as any in that circle. His  inferior nature rose halfway to meet his companions as they stooped.  Other faces wore the similitude of man or woman, but distorted or  extravagant, with red noses pendulous before their mouths, which  seemed of awful depth and stretched from ear to ear in an eternal fit  of laughter. Here might be seen the salvage man--well known in  heraldry--hairy as a baboon and girdled with green leaves. By his  side--a nobler figure, but still a counterfeit--appeared an Indian  hunter with feathery crest and wampum-belt. Many of this strange  company wore foolscaps and had little bells appended to their  garments, tinkling with a silvery sound responsive to the inaudible  music of their gleesome spirits. Some youths and maidens were of  soberer garb, yet well maintained their places in the irregular throng  by the expression of wild revelry upon their features.    Such were the colonists of Merry Mount as they stood in the broad  smile of sunset round their venerated Maypole. Had a wanderer  bewildered in the melancholy forest heard their mirth and stolen a  half-affrighted glance, he might have fancied them the crew of Comus,  some already transformed to brutes, some midway between man and beast,  and the others rioting in the flow of tipsy jollity that foreran the  change; but a band of Puritans who watched the scene, invisible  themselves, compared the masques to those devils and ruined souls with  whom their superstition peopled the black wilderness.    Within the ring of monsters appeared the two airiest forms that had  ever trodden on any more solid footing than a purple-and-golden cloud.  One was a youth in glistening apparel with a scarf of the rainbow  pattern crosswise on his breast. His right hand held a gilded  staff--the ensign of high dignity among the revellers--and his left  grasped the slender fingers of a fair maiden not less gayly decorated  than himself. Bright roses glowed in contrast with the dark and glossy  curls of each, and were scattered round their feet or had sprung up  spontaneously there. Behind this lightsome couple, so close to the  Maypole that its boughs shaded his jovial face, stood the figure of an  English priest, canonically dressed, yet decked with flowers, in  heathen fashion, and wearing a chaplet of the native vine leaves. By  the riot of his rolling eye and the pagan decorations of his holy  garb, he seemed the wildest monster there, and the very Comus of the  crew.    \"Votaries of the Maypole,\" cried the flower-decked priest, \"merrily  all day long have the woods echoed to your mirth. But be this your  merriest hour, my hearts! Lo! here stand the Lord and Lady of the May,  whom I, a clerk of Oxford and high priest of Merry Mount, am presently  to join in holy matrimony.--Up with your nimble spirits, ye  morrice-dancers, green men and glee-maidens, bears and wolves and  horned gentlemen! Come! a chorus now rich with the old mirth of Merry  England and the wilder glee of this fresh forest, and then a dance, to  show the youthful pair what life is made of and how airily they should  go through it!--All ye that love the Maypole, lend your voices to the  nuptial song of the Lord and Lady of the May!\"    This wedlock was more serious than most affairs of Merry Mount, where  jest and delusion, trick and fantasy, kept up a continual carnival.  The Lord and Lady of the May, though their titles must be laid down at  sunset, were really and truly to be partners for the dance of life,  beginning the measure that same bright eve. The wreath of roses that  hung "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#9)"],[1,"and  braggadocios, and was disposed to treat them accordingly. Mr. Astor was,  in his eyes, his only real employer, being the father of the enterprise,  who furnished all funds and bore all losses. The others were mere agents  and subordinates, who lived at his expense. He evidently had but a  narrow idea of the scope and nature of the enterprise, limiting his  views merely to his part of it; everything beyond the concerns of  his ship was out of his sphere; and anything that interfered with the  routine of his nautical duties put him in a passion.    The partners, on the other hand, had been brought up in the service  of the Northwest Company, and in a profound idea of the importance,  dignity, and authority of a partner. They already began to consider  themselves on a par with the M'Tavishes, the M'Gillivrays, the  Frobishers, and the other magnates of the Northwest, whom they had been  accustomed to look up to as the great ones of the earth; and they were  a little disposed, perhaps, to wear their suddenly-acquired honors with  some air of pretension. Mr. Astor, too, had put them on their mettle  with respect to the captain, describing him as a gunpowder fellow who  would command his ship in fine style, and, if there was any fighting to  do, would \"blow all out of the water.\"    Thus prepared to regard each other with no very cordial eye, it is not  to be wondered at that the parties soon came into collision. On the very  first night Captain Thorn began his man-of-war discipline by ordering  the lights in the cabin to be extinguished at eight o'clock.    The pride of the partners was immediately in arms. This was an invasion  of their rights and dignities not to be borne. They were on board  of their own ship, and entitled to consult their ease and enjoyment.  M'Dougal was the champion of their cause. He was an active, irritable,  fuming, vainglorious little man, and elevated in his own opinion, by  being the proxy of Mr. Astor. A violent altercation ensued, in the  course of which Thorn threatened to put the partners in irons should  they prove refractory; upon which M'Dougal seized a pistol and swore to  be the death of the captain should he ever offer such an indignity. It  was some time before the irritated parties could be pacified by the more  temperate bystanders.    Such was the captain's outset with the partners. Nor did the clerks  stand much higher in his good graces; indeed, he seems to have regarded  all the landsmen on board his ship as a kind of live lumber, continually  in the way. The poor voyageurs, too, continually irritated his spleen by  their \"lubberly\" and unseemly habits, so abhorrent to one accustomed  to the cleanliness of a man-of-war. These poor fresh-water sailors, so  vainglorious on shore, and almost amphibious when on lakes and rivers,  lost all heart and stomach the moment they were at sea. For days they  suffered the doleful rigors and retchings of sea-sickness, lurking below  in their berths in squalid state, or emerging now and then like spectres  from the hatchways, in capotes and blankets, with dirty nightcaps,  grizzly beard, lantern visage and unhappy eye, shivering about the deck,  and ever and anon crawling to the sides of the vessel, and offering up  their tributes to the windward, to infinite annoyance of the captain.    His letters to Mr. Astor, wherein he pours forth the bitterness of his  soul, and his seamanlike impatience of what he considers the \"lubberly\"  character and conduct of those around him, are before us, and are  amusingly characteristic. The honest captain is full of vexation on his  own account, and solicitude on account of Mr. Astor, whose property he  considers at the mercy of a most heterogeneous and wasteful crew.    As to the clerks, he pronounced them mere pretenders, not one of whom  had ever been among the Indians, nor farther to the northwest than  Montreal, nor of higher rank than barkeeper of a tavern or marker of a  billiard-table, excepting one, who had been a school-master, and whom he  emphatically sets down for \"as foolish a pedant as ever lived.\"    Then as to the artisans and laborers who had been brought from Canada  and shipped at such expense, the three most respectable, according  to the captain's account, were culprits, who had fled from Canada on  account of their misdeeds; the rest had figured in Montreal as draymen,  barbers, waiters, and carriole drivers, and were the most helpless,  worthless beings \"that ever broke sea-biscuit.\"    It may easily be imagined what a series of misunderstandings and  cross-purposes would be likely to take place between such a crew  and such a commander. The captain, in his zeal for the health and  cleanliness of his ship, would make sweeping visitations to the \"lubber  nests\" of the unlucky \"voyageurs\" and their companions in misery, ferret  them out of their berths, make them air and wash themselves and their  accoutrements, and oblige them to stir about briskly and take exercise.    Nor did his disgust and vexation cease when all hands had recovered from  sea-sickness, and become accustomed to the ship, for now broke out an  alarming keenness of appetite that threatened havoc to the provisions.  What especially irritated the captain was the daintiness of some of his  cabin passengers. They were loud in their complaints of the ship's fare,  though their table was served with fresh pork, hams, tongues, smoked  beef, and puddings. \"When thwarted in their cravings for delicacies,\"  Said he, \"they would exclaim it was d-d hard they could not live as  they pleased upon their own property, being on board of their own ship,  freighted with their own merchandise. And these,\" added he, \"are the  fine fellows who made such boast that they could 'eat dogs.'\"    In his indignation at what he termed their effeminacy, he would swear  that he would never take them to sea again \"without having Fly-market on  the forecastle, Covent-garden on the poop, and a cool spring from Canada  in the maintop.\"    As they proceeded on their voyage and got into the smooth seas and  pleasant weather of the tropics, other annoyances occurred to vex the  spirit of the captain. He had been crossed by the irritable mood of one  of the partners; he was now excessively annoyed by the good-humor of  another. This was the elder Stuart, who was an easy soul, and of a  social disposition. He had seen life in Canada, and on the coast of  Labrador; had been a fur trader in the former, and a fisherman on  the latter; and, in the course of his experience, had made various  expeditions with voyageurs. He was accustomed, therefore, to the  familiarity which prevails between that class and their superiors, and  the gossipings which take place among them when seated round a fire  at their encampments. Stuart was never so happy as when he could seat  himself on the deck with a number of these men round him, in camping  style, smoke together, passing the pipe from mouth to mouth, after the  manner of the Indians, sing old Canadian boat-songs, and tell stories  about their hardships and adventures, in the course of which he rivaled  Sinbad in his long tales of the sea, about his fishing exploits on the  coast of Labrador.    This gossiping familiarity shocked the captain's notions of rank and  subordination, and nothing was so abhorrent to him as the community  of pipe between master and man, and their mingling in chorus in the  outlandish boat-songs.    Then there was another whimsical source of annoyance to him. Some of the  young clerks, who were making their first voyage, and to whom everything  was new and strange, were, very rationally, in the habit of taking notes  and keeping journals. This was a sore abomination to the honest captain,  who held their literary pretensions in great contempt. \"The collecting  of materials for long histories of their voyages and travels,\" said  he, in his letter to Mr. Astor, \"appears to engross most of their  attention.\" We can conceive what must have been the crusty impatience of  the worthy navigator, when, on any trifling occurrence in the course of  the voyage, quite commonplace in his eyes, he saw these young landsmen  running to record it in their journals; and what indignant glances he  must have cast to right and left, as he worried about the deck, giving  out his orders for the management of the ship, surrounded by singing,  smoking, gossiping, scribbling groups, all, as he thought, intent upon  the amusement of the passing hour, instead of the great purposes and  interests of the voyage.    It is possible the captain was in some degree right in his notions.  Though some of the passengers had much to gain by the voyage, none of  them had anything positively to lose. They were mostly young men, in the  heyday of life; and having got into fine latitudes, upon smooth seas,  with a well-stored ship under them, and a fair wind in the shoulder  of the sail, they seemed to have got into a holiday world, and were  disposed to enjoy it. That craving desire, natural to untravelled men of  fresh and lively minds, to see strange lands, and to visit scenes famous  in history or fable, was expressed by some of the partners and clerks,  with respect to some of the storied coasts and islands that lay within  their route. The captain, however, who regarded every coast and island  with a matter-of-fact eye, and had no more associations connected  with them than those laid down in his sea-chart, considered all this  curiosity as exceedingly idle and childish. \"In the first part of the  voyage,\" says he in his letter, \"they were determined to have it said  they had been in Africa, and therefore insisted on stopping at the  Cape de Verdes. Next they said the ship should stop on the coast of  Patagonia, for they must see the large and uncommon inhabitants of that  place. Then they must go to the island where Robinson Crusoe had so long  lived. And lastly, they were determined to see the handsome"]]]
