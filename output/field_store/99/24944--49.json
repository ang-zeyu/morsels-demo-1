Its wealth was fabulous when it was looted and destroyed  by Altamsh and his Pathan Mahomedans in 1235. The present buildings are  for the most part barely 200 years old, and remarkable chiefly for the  insistency with which the _lingam_ and the bull, the favourite symbols  of Shiva, repeat themselves in shrine after shrine. But it attracts  immense numbers of pilgrims, especially in every twelfth year, when they  flock in hundreds of thousands to Ujjain and camp as near as possible to  the river. The peculiarity of the Ujjain festival is that, in memory of  the form which Shiva took on when he wooed Uma, it attracts a veritable  army of Sanyasis, or mendicants, sometimes as many as fifty thousand,  from all parts of India. Seldom, except at the great Jaganath festivals  at Puri, is a larger congregation seen of weird and almost inhuman  figures; some clothed solely with their long unkempt hair, some with  their bodies smeared all over with white ashes, and the symbol of their  favourite deity painted conspicuously on their foreheads; some  displaying ugly sores or withered limbs as evidence of lifelong  mortification of the flesh; some moving as if in a dream and entirely  lost to the world's realities; some with frenzied eyes shouting and  brandishing their instruments of self-torture; some with a repulsive  leer and heavy sensuous jowls affecting a certain coquetry in the  ritualistic adornment of their well-fed bodies.    Chandragupta I., the founder of the great dynasty which Hindus extol  above all others, was only a petty chieftain by birth, but he was  fortunate enough to wed a lady of high lineage, who could trace a  connection with the ancient Maurya house of Magadha, and, thanks to this  alliance and to his own prowess, he was able at his death to bequeath  real kingship to his son, Samadragupta, who, during a fifty years'  reign, A.D. 326-375, again welded almost the whole of India north of the  Nerbudda river into one empire, and once even spoiled Southern India  right down to Cape Comorin. His victories are recorded--with an irony  perhaps not wholly accidental--beneath the Asokan inscription on the  Allahabad pillar. Of his zeal for Hinduism we have a convincing proof in  gold coins of his reign that preserve on the obverse in the figure of  the sacrificial horse a record of the _Asvamedha_, which he again  revived. Strange to say, however, his fame has never been so popular as  that of his son, Chandragupta II., Vikramadytia, the Sun of Power, who  reigned in turn for nearly forty years, and has lived in Hindu legend as  the Raja Bikram, to whom India owes her golden age. It was his court at  Ujjain which is believed to have been adorned by the \"Nine Gems\" of  Sanskrit literature, amongst whom the favourite is Kalidasa, the poet  and dramatist. Amidst much that is speculative, one thing is certain.  The age of Vikramadytia was an age of Brahmanical ascendancy. As has so  often happened, and is still happening in India to-day in the struggle  between Urdu and Hindi, the battle of religious and political supremacy  was largely one of languages. During the centuries of Brahmanical  depression that preceded the Gupta dynasty, the more vulgar tongue  spoken of the people prevailed. Under the Guptas, Sanskrit, which was  the language of the Brahmans, resumed its pre-eminence and took  possession of the whole field of literature and art and science as well  as of theology. Oral traditions were reduced to writing and poetry was  adapted to both sacred and profane uses in the Puranas, in the metrical  code of Manu, in treatises on sacrificial ritual, in Kalidasa's plays,  and in many other works of which only fragments have survived.  Astronomy, logic, philosophy were all cultivated with equal fervour and  to the greater glory of Brahmanism. Local tradition is doubtless quite  wrong in assigning to Raja Bikram the noble gateway which is the only  monument of Hindu architecture at its best that Ujjain has to show  to-day. But to that period may, perhaps, be traced the graceful, if  highly ornate, style of architecture, of which the Bhuvaneshwar temples,  several centuries more recent, are the earliest examples that can be at  all accurately dated. To the credit of Brahmanism be it said that in its  hour of triumph it remained at least negatively tolerant, as all purely  Indian creeds generally have been. Fa-Hien, who visited India during the  reign of Vikramadytia, though dismayed at the desolation which had  already overtaken many of the sacred places of Buddhism, pays a generous  tribute to the tolerance and statesmanship of that great sovereign. The  country seems, indeed, to have enjoyed real prosperity under a paternal  and almost model administration.    Yet the Gupta dynasty endured only a little longer than had that of the  Mauryas. Its downfall was hastened by the long reign of terror which  India went through during the invasion of the White Huns. Europe had  undergone a like ordeal nearly a century earlier, for when the Huns  began to move out of the steppes of Eastern Asia they poured forth in  two separate streams, one of which swept into Eastern Europe, whilst the  other flowed more slowly towards Persia and India. What Attila had been  to Europe, Mihiragula was to India, and though the domination of the  Huns did not long outlive him, the anarchy they left behind them  continued for another century, until \"the land of Kuru,\" the cradle and  battle-field of so many legendary heroes, produced another heroic  figure, who, as King Harsha, filled for more than forty years (606-648)  the stage of Indian history with his exploits. He had inherited the  blood of the Gupta emperors from his mother, though his father was only  a small Raja of Thanesvar, to the north of Delhi. The tragic  circumstances in which he succeeded him made a man of him at the early  age of fourteen. By the time he was twenty he was \"master of the five  Indias\"--_i.e._ of nearly the whole of Northern India from Kathiawar to  the delta of the Ganges, and henceforth he proved himself as great in  peace as in war. In his case the knowledge we owe to Chinese sources is  supplemented by the valuable record left by the Brahman Bana, who lived  at his court and wrote the Harsha-Charita. Taxation, we are told, was  lightened, and the assessment of land revenue was equitable and  moderate. Security for life and property was enforced under severe but  effective penalties. Education received impartial encouragement whether  conducted by Brahmans or by Buddhist monks, and both as a patron of  literature, which he himself cultivated by composing dramas, and as a  philanthropic ruler King Harsha bestowed his favours with a fairly equal  hand on Hinduism and on Buddhism alike. For Buddhism still lingered in  the land, and Harsha, who was a mystic and a dreamer as well as a man of  action, certainly inclined during his later years towards Buddhism, or,  at least, included it in his own eclectic creed.    Hiuen-Tsang, who spent fifteen years in India during Harsha's reign,  searching for the relics of early Buddhism in a land from which it was  steadily disappearing, has given us a wonderful picture of a religious  state-pageant which makes Prayaga, at the triple confluence of the  Ganges and the Jumna with the sacred but invisible river, Saraswati,  near to the modern city of Allahabad, stand out as another striking  landmark in Indian history. Hindus attach great holiness to rivers and  their confluence, and this Triveni, or triple confluence, had been  specially consecrated by Brahma, who chose that spot for the first  _Asvamedha_. \"From ancient times,\" says the Chinese chronicler, \"the  kings used to go there to distribute alms, and hence it was known as the  Place of Almsgiving. According to tradition more merit is gained by  giving one piece of money there than one hundred thousand elsewhere.\" So  King Harsha having invited all alike, whether \"followers of the law or  heretics, the ascetics and the poor, the orphans and the helpless,\" the  kings of eighteen subordinate kingdoms assembled there with their people  to the number of 500,000, and found immense refectories laid out for  their refreshment, and long rows of warehouses to receive silk and  cotton garments and gold and silver coins for distribution to them. \"The  first day a statue of Buddha was placed in the shrine erected on the  Place of Almsgiving, and there was a distribution of the most precious  things and of the garments of greatest value, whilst exquisite viands  were served and flowers scattered to the sound of harmonious music. Then  all retired to their resting-places. On the second day a statue of the  Sun-god was placed in the shrine, and on the third day the statue of  Shiva,\" and the distribution of gifts continued on those days and day  after day for a period of over two months, ten thousand Brahmans  receiving the lion's share, until, having exhausted all his wealth, even  to the jewels and garments he was wearing, King Harsha borrowed a coarse  and much-worn garment, and having \"adored the Buddhas of the ten  countries,\" he gave vent to his pious delight, exclaiming: \"Whilst I was  amassing all this wealth I was always afraid lest I should find no safe  and secret place to stow it away. Now that I have deposited it by  alms-giving in the Field of Happiness I know that it is for ever in  safety. I pray that in my future lives I may amass in like manner great  treasures and give them away in alms so as to obtain the ten divine  faculties in all their plenitude.\"    Here one sees India as it was before the Mahomedan invasions, in the  days of the last of the great Indian rulers who succeeded for a time in  bending the whole of Northern India to his will.

The time has gone by when the  musician and composer was considered a sort of freak, knowing music and  nothing else. We know the great composers were men of the highest  intelligence and learning, men whose aim was to work out their genius  to the utmost perfection. Nothing less than the highest would satisfy  them. As George Eliot said, 'Genius is the capacity for taking infinite  pains.' Think of the care Beethoven took with every phrase, how many  times he did it over, never leaving it till he was satisfied.\"    In speaking of the great European teachers Mr. Roeder continued:    \"We hear much of the Leschetizky method; but with that master technic is  quite a secondary matter over which, when once the principles are  mastered, he troubles himself but little. It is the conception of the  work as a whole which concerns him, how to project it, so to say, most  effectively to an audience. He brings into prominence now this part, now  that, accenting here, slightly exaggerating there, in order to make the  picture more vivid to the listener. Harold Bauer is another illuminating  master for those who have a technical equipment adequate to the  performance of great works of piano literature. Some go to him who are  not ready for what he has to give, but to those who can direct attention  to the meaning of the music, he is a wonderful inspirational force.  First he will point out a phrase here, another there, and so on through  the piece, showing how the same idea takes on various aspects in the  composer's thought. Then he shows how to gather up these different  threads to form the perfect pattern which the author of the work had in  mind; and finally the master teacher reaches down below the surface of  form and design to the vital significance of the composition, and the  disciple feels the glow and power of the revelation.    \"There is no gainsaying the fact that this age is superficial, and the  great office of art is to cultivate that idealism which will uplift and  inspire. In an important sense the teacher must be a preacher of  righteousness. He knows that 'beautiful things are fashioned from clay,  but it has first to pass through the fire,' and only those who can  endure that scorching can hope to achieve success.      QUESTION OF PERSONALITY    \"If asked to what extent a player's personality enters into the  performance, my answer would be: Only in so far as the performance  remains true to the composer's intention. So long as personality  illumines the picture and adds charm, interest, and effectiveness to it,  it is to be applauded; but when it obstructs the view and calls  attention to itself it should not be tolerated. It is not art; it is  vanity.    \"Yes, I teach both high finger action and pressure touch, once the  principle of arm weight is thoroughly established, although I use high  finger action only to develop finger independence and precision, and for  passages where sharp delineation is required. I believe in freedom of  body, arm and wrist, a firm, solid arched hand and set fingers. That  freedom is best which insures such control of the various playing  members as to enable the player to produce at will any effect of power,  velocity or delicacy desired; thereby placing the entire mechanical  apparatus under complete subjection to the mind, which dominates the  performance. In other words, I am neither an anarchist who wants no  government, namely unrestrained devitalization, nor a socialist, whose  cry is for all government--that is, restriction and rigidity. In piano  playing, as in all else, 'Virtue is the happy mean between two vices.'\"          X    KATHARINE GOODSON    AN ARTIST AT HOME      When one has frequently listened to a favorite pianist in the concert  room, and has studied impersonally, so to speak, the effects of touch,  tone and interpretation produced during a recital, it is a satisfaction  and delight to come into personal touch with the artist in the inner  circle of the home; to be able to speak face to face with one who has  charmed thousands from the platform, and to discuss freely the points  which impress one when listening to a public performance.    [Illustration: Katharine Goodson]    It has been my recent privilege thus to come into intimate touch with  the artist pair, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Hinton, the latter being known all  over the world as Katharine Goodson. They have a quiet, beautiful home  in London--a true artist's home. One feels at once on entering and  enjoying its hospitality, that here at least is one instance where two  musicians have perfect harmony in the home life. Mr. Hinton, as is  widely known, is a composer and also a violinist and pianist. The  beautiful music-room, which has been added to one side of the house and  leads into the garden, contains two grand pianos on its raised platform.  This music-room is Miss Goodson's own sanctum and workroom, and here  piano concertos, with orchestral accompaniment supplied on the second  piano, can be studied _ad infinitum_. Mr. Hinton has his own studio at  the top of the house.    The garden music-room is lighted at one end by a great arched window, so  placed that the trees of the garden are seen through its panes. It is  easy to imagine one's self in some lovely sylvan retreat--which is  indeed true! All the appointments of this room, and indeed of the whole  house, every article of furniture and each touch of color, betoken the  artistic sense for fitness and harmony. Miss Goodson has a keen and  exquisite sense for harmony in colors as well as for color in the  harmonies she brings from her instrument.    \"My coming tour will be the fifth I have made in America,\" she said. \"I  enjoy playing in your country immensely; the cities of New York, Boston,  Chicago, and Philadelphia are the most appreciative in the world. It is  true we have masses of concerts in London, but few of them are really  well attended and people are not so thoroughly acquainted with piano  music as you are in America. And you are so appreciative of the  best--even in the smaller cities.    \"I can recall a recital which I gave in a city of not more than forty  thousand, in the West. The recital was arranged by a musical club; they  asked for the program some time in advance, studied it up and thus knew  every piece I was to play. There was an enormous audience, for people  came from all the country round. I remember three little elderly ladies  who greeted me after the recital; in parting they said, 'You will see us  to-morrow,' I thought it over afterward and wondered what they meant,  for I was to play at a place many miles from there the next night. What  was my surprise to be greeted by the same ladles the following evening.  'You see, we are here; we told you we would come.' Fancy taking a trip  from London to Edinburgh just to hear a concert! For it was a journey  like that. Such incidents show the enthusiasm in America for music--and  for piano music.    \"I hope to play both the Brahms and Paderewski concertos in America. To  me the latter is a beautiful work--the slow movement is exquisite. I  have as yet scarcely done anything with the composition, for I have been  on a long tour through Norway, Sweden, and Finland. It was most  inspiring to play for these people; they want me to come back to them  now, but I cannot do so, nor can I go next season, but after that I  shall go. I returned home greatly in need of rest. I shall now begin  work in earnest, however, as summer is really the only time I have for  study throughout the year. I shall have six full weeks now before we  take our usual holiday in the Grindelwald. On the way there we shall  stop at Morges and visit Paderewski, and then I will go over the  concerto with him and get his ideas as to interpretation.      MEMORIZING BY ANALYSIS    \"You ask how I memorize. First I go over the work several times to get a  general idea of the whole. Then I analyze it, for I feel it absolutely  necessary to know keys, chords, and construction. A work should be so  well understood along these lines that it can be played in another key  as well as in the one in which it is written. For the actual memorizing  of the piece I generally do it phrase by phrase, not always 'each hand  alone,' though occasionally I do this also. I remember learning the Bach  A minor Prelude and Fugue in this way. If I were now asked to play any  measure or passage in any part of it I could do so; it is mine forever,  never to be forgotten.\"    Asked about the different ways of teaching the Leschetizky method by  various teachers, Miss Goodson said:    \"As we all know, people claim to understand and teach the Leschetizky  principles who are not competent to do so. I do not recall, for  instance, that the professor requires the tips of the fingers to form a  straight line on the edge of the keys. I myself have never done this. I  believe in a perfectly easy and natural position of hand at the  keyboard. When this is the case the finger-tips form a curve, the middle  fingers being placed a little farther in on the keys than is natural for  the first and fifth. Of course the hand takes an arched position and the  joints nearest the tip of the fingers must be firm; there should be no  wavering nor giving in there. The whole arm, of course, is relaxed, and  swings easily from the shoulder.      A PIANO HAND    \"I have, as you say, a good hand for the piano; much depends on that; I  have always had a good deal of what is called a natural technic. Thus  when I am obliged to forego practising I do not lose my facility; an  hour's work puts the hand in condition again. What do I do to accomplish  this? Different things. First some finger movements, perhaps with  fingers in an extended chord position; then some scales and arpeggios;  then a Chopin etude, and so on. When practising regularly, I do not  generally work at the piano"]]]
