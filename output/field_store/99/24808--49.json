As he said nothing more, she bent over and kissed him on the forehead.  Then, once more bowing to the two visitors, she went out. A moment later  they heard the sound of the motor driving away.    Hippolyte Fauville at once rose and rang the bell. Then he said:    \"No one here has any idea of the danger hanging over me. I have confided  in nobody, not even in Silvestre, my own man, though he has been in my  service for years and is honesty itself.\"    The manservant entered.    \"I am going to bed, Silvestre,\" said M. Fauville. \"Get everything ready.\"    Silvestre opened the upper part of the great sofa, which made a  comfortable bed, and laid the sheets and blankets. Next, at his master's  orders, he brought a jug of water, a glass, a plate of biscuits, and a  dish of fruit.    M. Fauville ate a couple of biscuits and then cut a dessert-apple. It was  not ripe. He took two others, felt them, and, not thinking them good, put  them back as well. Then he peeled a pear and ate it.    \"You can leave the fruit dish,\" he said to his man. \"I shall be glad of  it, if I am hungry during the night.... Oh, I was forgetting! These two  gentlemen are staying. Don't mention it to anybody. And, in the morning,  don't come until I ring.\"    The man placed the fruit dish on the table before retiring. Perenna, who  was noticing everything, and who was afterward to remember every smallest  detail of that evening, which his memory recorded with a sort of  mechanical faithfulness, counted three pears and four apples in the dish.    Meanwhile, Fauville went up the winding staircase, and, going along the  gallery, reached the room where his son lay in bed.    \"He's fast asleep,\" he said to Perenna, who had joined him.    The bedroom was a small one. The air was admitted by a special system of  ventilation, for the dormer window was hermetically closed by a wooden  shutter tightly nailed down.    \"I took the precaution last year,\" Hippolyte Fauville explained. \"I used  to make my electrical experiments in this room and was afraid of being  spied upon, so I closed the aperture opening on the roof.\"    And he added in a low voice:    \"They have been prowling around me for a long time.\"    The two men went downstairs again.    Fauville looked at his watch.    \"A quarter past ten: bedtime, I am exceedingly tired, and you will  excuse me--\"    It was arranged that Perenna and Mazeroux should make themselves  comfortable in a couple of easy chairs which they carried into the  passage between the study and the entrance hall. But, before bidding them  good-night, Hippolyte Fauville, who, although greatly excited, had  appeared until then to retain his self-control, was seized with a sudden  attack of weakness. He uttered a faint cry. Don Luis turned round and saw  the sweat pouring like gleaming water down his face and neck, while he  shook with fever and anguish.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Perenna.    \"I'm frightened! I'm frightened!\" he said.    \"This is madness!\" cried Don Luis. \"Aren't we here, the two of us? We can  easily spend the night with you, if you prefer, by your bedside.\"    Fauville replied by shaking Perenna violently by the shoulder, and, with  distorted features, stammering:    \"If there were ten of you--if there were twenty of you with me, you need  not think that it would spoil their schemes! They can do anything they  please, do you hear, anything! They have already killed Inspector  Verot--they will kill me--and they will kill my son. Oh, the blackguards!  My God, take pity on me! The awful terror of it! The pain I suffer!\"    He had fallen on his knees and was striking his breast and repeating:    \"O God, have pity on me! I can't die! I can't let my son die! Have pity  on me, I beseech Thee!\"    He sprang to his feet and led Perenna to a glass-fronted case, which  he rolled back on its brass castors, revealing a small safe built  into the wall.    \"You will find my whole story here, written up day by day for the past  three years. If anything should happen to me, revenge will be easy.\"    He hurriedly turned the letters of the padlock and, with a key which he  took from his pocket, opened the safe.    It was three fourths empty; but on one of the shelves, between some piles  of papers, was a diary bound in drab cloth, with a rubber band round it.  He took the diary, and, emphasizing his words, said:    \"There, look, it's all in here. With this, the hideous business can  be reconstructed.... There are my suspicions first and then my  certainties.... Everything, everything ... how to trap them and how  to do for them.... You'll remember, won't you? A diary bound in drab  cloth.... I'm putting it back in the safe.\"    Gradually his calmness returned. He pushed back the glass case, tidied a  few papers, switched on the electric lamp above his bed, put out the  lights in the middle of the ceiling, and asked Don Luis and Mazeroux to  leave him.    Don Luis, who was walking round the room and examining the iron shutters  of the two windows, noticed a door opposite the entrance door and asked  the engineer about it.    \"I use it for my regular clients,\" said Fauville, \"and sometimes I go out  that way.\"    \"Does it open on the garden?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is it properly closed?\"    \"You can see for yourself; it's locked and bolted with a safety bolt.  Both keys are on my bunch; so is the key of the garden gate.\"    He placed the bunch of keys on the table with his pocket-book and, after  first winding it, his watch.    Don Luis, without troubling to ask permission, took the keys and  unfastened the lock and the bolt. A flight of three steps brought him to  the garden. He followed the length of the narrow border. Through the ivy  he saw and heard the two policemen pacing up and down the boulevard. He  tried the lock of the gate. It was fastened.    \"Everything's all right,\" he said when he returned, \"and you can be easy.  Good-night.\"    \"Good-night,\" said the engineer, seeing Perenna and Mazeroux out.    Between his study and the passage were two doors, one of which was padded  and covered with oilcloth. On the other side, the passage was separated  from the hall by a heavy curtain.    \"You can go to sleep,\" said Perenna to his companion. \"I'll sit up.\"    \"But surely, Chief, you don't think that anything's going to happen!\"    \"I don't think so, seeing the precautions which we've taken. But,  knowing Inspector Verot as you did, do you think he was the man to  imagine things?\"    \"No, Chief.\"    \"Well, you know what he prophesied. That means that he had his reasons  for doing so. And therefore I shall keep my eyes open.\"    \"We'll take it in turns, Chief; wake me when it's my time to watch.\"    Seated motionlessly, side by side, they exchanged an occasional remark.  Soon after, Mazeroux fell asleep. Don Luis remained in his chair without  moving, his ears pricked up. Everything was quiet in the house. Outside,  from time to time, the sound of a motor car or of a cab rolled by. He  could also hear the late trains on the Auteuil line.    He rose several times and went up to the door. Not a sound. Hippolyte  Fauville was evidently asleep.    \"Capital!\" said Perenna to himself. \"The boulevard is watched. No one can  enter the room except by this way. So there is nothing to fear.\"    At two o'clock in the morning a car stopped outside the house, and one of  the manservants, who must have been waiting in the kitchen, hastened to  the front door. Perenna switched off the light in the passage, and,  drawing the curtain slightly aside, saw Mme. Fauville enter, followed by  Silvestre.    She went up. The lights on the staircase were put out. For half an hour  or so there was a sound overhead of voices and of chairs moving. Then all  was silence.    And, amid this silence, Perenna felt an unspeakable anguish arise within  him, he could not tell why. But it was so violent, the impression became  so acute, that he muttered:    \"I shall go and see if he's asleep. I don't expect that he has bolted  the doors.\"    He had only to push both doors to open them; and, with his electric  lantern in his hand, he went up to the bed. Hippolyte Fauville was  sleeping with his face turned to the wall.    Perenna gave a smile of relief. He returned to the passage and,  shaking Mazeroux:    \"Your turn, Alexandre.\"    \"No news, Chief?\"    \"No, none; he's asleep.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"I've had a look at him.\"    \"That's funny; I never heard you. It's true, though, I've slept  like a pig.\"    He followed Perenna into the study, and Perenna said:    \"Sit down and don't wake him. I shall take forty winks.\"    He had one more turn at sentry duty. But, even while dozing, he remained  conscious of all that happened around him. A clock struck the hours with  a low chime; and each time Perenna counted the strokes. Then came the  life outside awakening, the rattle of the milk-carts, the whistle of the  early suburban trains.    People began to stir inside the house. The daylight trickled in  through the crannies of the shutters, and the room gradually became  filled with light.    \"Let's go away,\" said Sergeant Mazeroux. \"It would be better for him not  to find us here.\"    \"Hold your tongue!\" said Don Luis, with an imperious gesture.    \"Why?\"    \"You'll wake him up.\"    \"But you can see I'm not waking him,\" said Mazeroux, without  lowering his tone.    \"That's true, that's true,\" whispered Don Luis, astonished that the sound  of that voice had not disturbed the sleeper.    And he felt himself overcome with the same anguish that had seized upon  him in the middle of the night, a more clearly defined anguish, although  he would not, although he dared not, try to realize the reason of it.    \"What's the matter with you, Chief? You're looking like nothing on earth.  What is it?\"    \"Nothing--nothing. I'm frightened--\"    Mazeroux shuddered."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"en,--a sense which I once possessed in the highest  perfection, to an extent, indeed, that few of my profession ever enjoyed!  Alas, I cannot do this! Forgive me therefore when you see me withdraw from  you with whom I would so gladly mingle. My misfortune is doubly severe from  causing me to be misunderstood. No longer can I enjoy recreation in social  intercourse, refined conversation, or mutual outpourings of thought.  Completely isolated, I only enter society when compelled to do so. I must  live like an exile. In company I am assailed by the most painful  apprehensions, from the dread of being exposed to the risk of my condition  being observed. It was the same during the last six months I spent in the  country. My intelligent physician recommended me to spare my hearing as  much as possible, which was quite in accordance with my present  disposition, though sometimes, tempted by my natural inclination for  society, I allowed myself to be beguiled into it. But what humiliation when  any one beside me heard a flute in the far distance, while I heard  _nothing_, or when others heard _a shepherd singing_, and I still heard  _nothing_! Such things brought me to the verge of desperation, and wellnigh  caused me to put an end to my life. _Art! art_ alone, deterred me. Ah! how  could I possibly quit the world before bringing forth all that I felt it  was my vocation to produce?[2] And thus I spared this miserable life--so  utterly miserable that any sudden change may reduce me at any moment from  my best condition into the worst. It is decreed that I must now choose  _Patience_ for my guide! This I have done. I hope the resolve will not fail  me, steadfastly to persevere till it may please the inexorable Fates to cut  the thread of my life. Perhaps I may get better, perhaps not. I am prepared  for either. Constrained to become a philosopher in my twenty-eighth  year![3] This is no slight trial, and more severe on an artist than on any  one else. God looks into my heart, He searches it, and knows that love for  man and feelings of benevolence have their abode there! Oh! ye who may one  day read this, think that you have done me injustice, and let any one  similarly afflicted be consoled, by finding one like himself, who, in  defiance of all the obstacles of Nature, has done all in his power to be  included in the ranks of estimable artists and men. My brothers Carl and  Johann, as soon as I am no more, if Professor Schmidt [see Nos. 18 and 23]  be still alive, beg him in my name to describe my malady, and to add these  pages to the analysis of my disease, that at least, so far as possible, the  world may be reconciled to me after my death. I also hereby declare you  both heirs of my small fortune (if so it may be called). Share it fairly,  agree together and assist each other. You know that anything you did to  give me pain has been long forgiven. I thank you, my brother Carl in  particular, for the attachment you have shown me of late. My wish is that  you may enjoy a happier life, and one more free from care, than mine has  been. Recommend _Virtue_ to your children; that alone, and not wealth, can  ensure happiness. I speak from experience. It was _Virtue_ alone which  sustained me in my misery; I have to thank her and Art for not having ended  my life by suicide. Farewell! Love each other. I gratefully thank all my  friends, especially Prince Lichnowsky and Professor Schmidt. I wish one of  you to keep Prince L----'s instruments; but I trust this will give rise to  no dissension between you. If you think it more beneficial, however, you  have only to dispose of them. How much I shall rejoice if I can serve you  even in the grave! So be it then! I joyfully hasten to meet Death. If he  comes before I have had the opportunity of developing all my artistic  powers, then, notwithstanding my cruel fate, he will come too early for me,  and I should wish for him at a more distant period; but even then I shall  be content, for his advent will release me from a state of endless  suffering. Come when he may, I shall meet him with courage. Farewell! Do  not quite forget me, even in death; I deserve this from you, because during  my life I so often thought of you, and wished to make you happy. Amen!    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    (_Written on the Outside._)    Thus, then, I take leave of you, and with sadness too. The fond hope I  brought with me here, of being to a certain degree cured, now utterly  forsakes me. As autumn leaves fall and wither, so are my hopes blighted.  Almost as I came, I depart. Even the lofty courage that so often animated  me in the lovely days of summer is gone forever. O Providence! vouchsafe me  one day of pure felicity! How long have I been estranged from the glad echo  of true joy! When! O my God! when shall I again feel it in the temple of  Nature and of man?--never? Ah! that would be too hard!

[Footnote 1: This beautiful letter I regret not to have seen in the  original, it being in the possession of the violin _virtuoso_ Ernst, in  London. I have adhered to the version given in the Leipzig _Allgemeine  Musikalische Zeitung_, Oct. 1827.]    [Footnote 2: A large portion of the _Eroica_ was written in the course of  this summer, but not completed till August, 1804.]    [Footnote 3: Beethoven did not at that time know in what year he was born.  See the subsequent letter of May 2, 1810. He was then far advanced in his  thirty-third year.]      27.    NOTICE.    November, 1802.    I owe it to the public and to myself to state that the two quintets in C  and E flat major--one of these (arranged from a symphony of mine) published  by Herr Mollo in Vienna, and the other (taken from my Septet, Op. 20) by  Herr Hofmeister in Leipzig--are not original quintets, but only versions of  the aforesaid works given by the publishers. Arrangements in these days (so  fruitful in--arrangements) an author will find it vain to contend against;  but we may at least justly demand that the fact should be mentioned in the  title-page, neither to injure the reputation of the author nor to deceive  the public. This notice is given to prevent anything of the kind in future.  I also beg to announce that shortly a new original quintet of my  composition, in C major, Op. 29, will appear at Breitkopf & Haertel's in  Leipzig.    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      28.    TO FERDINAND RIES.    Summer of 1803.    You no doubt are aware that I am here. Go to Stein, and ask if he can send  me an instrument, on hire. I am afraid of bringing mine here. Come to me  this evening about seven o'clock. I lodge in Oberdoebling, on the left side  of the street, No. 4, going down the hill towards Heiligenstadt.      29.    TO HERR HOFMEISTER,--LEIPZIG.    Vienna, Sept. 22, 1803.    I hereby declare all the works you have ordered to be your property. The  list of these shall be made out and sent to you with my signature, as the  proof of their being your own. I also agree to accept the sum of fifty  ducats for them. Are you satisfied?    Perhaps, instead of the variations with violoncello and violin,[1] I may  send you variations for the piano, arranged as a duet on a song of mine;  but Goethe's poetry must also be engraved, as I wrote these variations in  an album, and consider them better than the others. Are you satisfied?    The arrangements are not by me, though I have revised and much improved  various passages; but I do not wish you to say that I have arranged them,  for it would be false, and I have neither time nor patience to do so. Are  you satisfied?    Now farewell! I sincerely wish that all may go well with you. I would  gladly make you a present of all my works, if I could do so and still get  on in the world; but--remember most people are provided for, and know what  they have to live on, while, good heavens! where can an appointment be  found at the Imperial Court for such a _parvum talentum com ego_?    Your friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: These are the six variations in D, on the air _Ich denke Dein_  written in 1800 in the album of the Countesses Josephine Deym and Therese  of Brunswick.]      30.    CAUTION.    November, 1803.    Herr Carl Zulehner, a piratical engraver in Mayence, has announced an  edition of my collected works for the pianoforte and also stringed  instruments. I consider it my duty publicly to inform all friends of music  that I have no share whatever in this edition.    I would never have in any way authorized any collection of my works (which,  moreover, I consider premature) without previously consulting the  publishers of single pieces, and ensuring that correctness in which  editions of my individual works are so deficient. I must also observe that  this illegal edition cannot be complete, as several new works of mine are  shortly to appear in Paris, and these Herr Zulehner, being a French  subject, dare not pirate. I intend to take another opportunity of  enumerating the details of the collection of my works to be brought out  under my own auspices and careful revision.    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      31.    TO HERR RIES.[1]    1804.    Be so good as to make out a list of the mistakes and send it at once to  Simrock, and say that the work must appear as soon as possible. I will send  him the Sonata [Op. 47] and the Concerto the day after to-morrow.    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Ries relates that the three following notes refer to the  pianoforte Sonata, Op. 31, No. 1, carefully engraved by Naegeli in Zurich,  which Beethoven consequently sent forthwith to Simrock in Bonn, desiring  him to bring out \"_une edition tres-correcte_\" of the work. He also states  that Beethoven was residing in Heiligenstadt at the time the work was first  sent [see No. 26]. In Nottebohm's _Skizzenbuch von Beethoven_, he says (p.  43) that the first notice of the appearance of this sonata was on May 21st,  1803; but Simrock"]]]
