Though this observation of an  individual is not received as an universal maxim, it is certain that some  of the most eminent characters which ever existed, accustomed themselves  to early rising. It seems, also, that people in general rose earlier in  former times than now. In the fourteenth century, the shops in Paris were  opened at four in the morning; at present, a shopkeeper is scarcely awake  at seven.[8] The King of France dined at eight in the morning, and retired  to his bedchamber at the same hour in the evening. During the reign of  Henry VIII. fashionable people in England breakfasted at seven in the  morning, and dined at ten in the forenoon. In Elizabeth's time, the  nobility, gentry, and students, dined at eleven in the forenoon, and  supped between five and six in the afternoon.    SWAINE.

M.           *       *       *       *       *    _Dick's Coffee-house, Temple Bar_.--The Rev. James Miller wrote a comedy,  in the year 1737, entitled \"_The Coffee House_.\" \"This piece met with no  kind of success, from a supposition, how just (says Baker,) I cannot  pretend to determine, that Mrs. Yarrow and her daughter, who kept Dick's  coffee-house, near Temple Bar, and were at that time celebrated toasts,  together with several persons who frequented that house, were intended to  be ridiculed by the author. This he absolutely denied as being his  intention; when the piece came out, however, the engraver who had been  employed to compose a frontispiece, having inadvertently fixed on that  very coffee-house for the scene of his drawing, the Templars, with whom  the abovementioned ladies were great favourites, became, by this accident,  so confirmed in their suspicions, that they united to damn the piece, and  even extended their resentment to every thing which was suspected to be  this author's, for a considerable time after.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *    _Heroic Women._--Browella _heide_ or _heath_, is a plain in the province  of Smaland, in Sweden, celebrated for being the place where the Danes were  totally routed by the heroine, Blenda, who commanded the Smaland women, in  defence of their husbands, who were engaged in another expedition. As a  recompense for their bravery, the women of Smaland were honoured with  extraordinary privileges, and wore a kind of martial head-dress; and they  have still an equal share of inheritance with the men.

The circumstances are grave and it will  be necessary to act promptly.\"    \"Still!\" said the queen. \"I thought that we were finally quit of  Monsieur de Beaufort.\"    \"Yes, you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything  and you gave no attention to the still water. There is, however, a  proverb current in France relating to water which is quiet.\"    \"Continue,\" said the queen.    \"Well, then, madame, not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts  from your princes and your lordly servants, all of them automata who do  not perceive that I wind up the spring that makes them move, nor do they  see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured,  irritated man, who has sworn to himself to master them one of these  days. We have arrested Monsieur de Beaufort, but he is the least  dangerous among them. There is the Prince de Conde----\"    \"The hero of Rocroy. Do you think of him?\"    \"Yes, madame, often and often, but pazienza, as we say in Italy; next,  after Monsieur de Conde, comes the Duke of Orleans.\"    \"What are you saying? The first prince of the blood, the king's uncle!\"    \"No! not the first prince of the blood, not the king's uncle, but the  base conspirator, the soul of every cabal, who pretends to lead the  brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of  the blood--not the prince nearest to the throne, not the king's uncle, I  repeat, but the murderer of Chalais, of Montmorency and of Cinq-Mars,  who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that  he will win the game because he has a new adversary--instead of a man  who threatened, a man who smiles. But he is mistaken; I shall not leave  so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased  cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling  point.\"    Anne blushed and buried her face in her hands.    \"What am I to do?\" she said, bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant.    \"Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed  the Channel, in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu, tracking the roads along  which they passed by their blood, to bring back to your majesty certain  jewels given by you to Buckingham.\"    Anne arose, full of majesty, and as if touched by a spring, and looking  at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth  had made her so powerful: \"You are insulting me!\" she said.    \"I wish,\" continued Mazarin, finishing, as it were, the speech this  sudden movement of the queen had cut; \"I wish, in fact, that you should  now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover.\"    \"Again that accusation!\" cried the queen. \"I thought that calumny was  stifled or extinct; you have spared me till now, but since you speak of  it, once for all, I tell you----\"    \"Madame, I do not ask you to tell me,\" said Mazarin, astounded by this  returning courage.    \"I will tell you all,\" replied Anne. \"Listen: there were in truth, at  that epoch, four devoted hearts, four loyal spirits, four faithful  swords, who saved more than my life--my honor----\"    \"Ah! you confess it!\" exclaimed Mazarin.    \"Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others, sir? and  cannot women be dishonored by appearances? Yes, appearances were against  me and I was about to suffer dishonor. However, I swear I was not  guilty, I swear it by----\"    The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could  swear, and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry, a small  coffer of rosewood set in silver, and laying it on the altar:    \"I swear,\" she said, \"by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my  lover.\"    \"What relics are those by which you swear?\" asked Mazarin, smiling. \"I  am incredulous.\"    The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung  there, and presented it to the cardinal.    \"Open, sir,\" she said, \"and look for yourself.\"    Mazarin opened the coffer; a knife, covered with rust, and two letters,  one of which was stained with blood, alone met his gaze.    \"What are these things?\" he asked.    \"What are these things?\" replied Anne, with queen-like dignity,  extending toward the open coffer an arm, despite the lapse of years,  still beautiful. \"These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to  him. This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed him. Read the  letters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth.\"    But Mazarin, notwithstanding this permission, instead of reading the  letters, took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of  the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen. The blade was red, for the  blood had become rust; after a momentary examination during which the  queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she  was leaning, he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder.    \"It is well, madame, I believe your oath.\"    \"No, no, read,\" exclaimed the queen, indignantly; \"read, I command you,  for I am resolved that everything shall be finished to-night and never  will I recur to this subject again. Do you think,\" she said, with a  ghastly smile, \"that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer  any future accusations?\"    Mazarin, overcome by this determination, read the two letters. In one  the queen asked for the ornaments back again. This letter had been  conveyed by D'Artagnan and had arrived in time. The other was that which  Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, warning him  that he was about to be assassinated; that communication had arrived too  late.    \"It is well, madame,\" said Mazarin; \"nothing can gainsay such  testimony.\"    \"Sir,\" replied the queen, closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon  it, \"if there is anything to be said, it is that I have always been  ungrateful to the brave men who saved me--that I have given nothing to  that gallant officer, D'Artagnan, you were speaking of just now, but my  hand to kiss and this diamond.\"    As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed  him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger.    \"It appears,\" she resumed, \"that he sold it---he sold it in order to  save me another time--to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn  him of his danger--he sold it to Monsieur des Essarts, on whose finger I  remarked it. I bought it from him, but it belongs to D'Artagnan. Give it  back to him, sir, and since you have such a man in your service, make  him useful.\"    \"Thank you, madame,\" said Mazarin. \"I will profit by the advice.\"    \"And now,\" added the queen, her voice broken by her emotion, \"have you  any other question to ask me?\"    \"Nothing,\"--the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner--\"except  to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions. I love you so tenderly  that I cannot help being jealous, even of the past.\"    A smile, which was indefinable, passed over the lips of the queen.    \"Since you have no further interrogations to make, leave me, I beseech  you,\" she said. \"I wish, after such a scene, to be alone.\"    Mazarin bent low before her.    \"I will retire, madame. Do you permit me to return?\"    \"Yes, to-morrow.\"    The cardinal took the queen's hand and pressed it with an air of  gallantry to his lips.    Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son's room, and  inquired from Laporte if the king was in bed. Laporte pointed to the  child, who was asleep.    Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid  forehead of her son; then she retired as silently as she had come,  merely saying to Laporte:    \"Try, my dear Laporte, to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le  Cardinal, to whom both he and I are under such important obligations.\"          5. The Gascon and the Italian.      Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room; and after asking  Bernouin, who stood at the door, whether anything had occurred during  his absence, and being answered in the negative, he desired that he  might be left alone.    When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of  the ante-chamber. There D'Artagnan was asleep upon a bench.    The cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder. D'Artagnan  started, awakened himself, and as he awoke, stood up exactly like a  soldier under arms.    \"Here I am,\" said he. \"Who calls me?\"    \"I,\" said Mazarin, with his most smiling expression.    \"I ask pardon of your eminence,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but I was so  fatigued----\"    \"Don't ask my pardon, monsieur,\" said Mazarin, \"for you fatigued  yourself in my service.\"    D'Artagnan admired Mazarin's gracious manner. \"Ah,\" said he, between his  teeth, \"is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one  sleeps?\"    \"Follow me, monsieur,\" said Mazarin.    \"Come, come,\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"Rochefort has kept his promise, but  where in the devil is he?\" And he searched the cabinet even to the  smallest recesses, but there was no sign of Rochefort.    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the cardinal, sitting down on a fauteuil,  \"you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man.\"    \"Possibly,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"but he has taken a long time to let me  know his thoughts;\" nevertheless, he bowed to the very ground in  gratitude for Mazarin's compliment.    \"Well,\" continued Mazarin, \"the time has come to put to use your talents  and your valor.\"    There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer's eyes, which vanished  immediately, for he knew nothing of Mazarin's purpose.    \"Order, my lord,\" he said; \"I am ready to obey your eminence.\"    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" continued the cardinal, \"you"]]]
