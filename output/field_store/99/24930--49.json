Then the old gentleman rabbit traveled on again, and when it came night he  slept under a haystack.    \"I am sure I'll find my fortune to-day,\" thought Uncle Wiggily as he got  up and brushed the hay seed out of his ears the next morning.    It was a bright, beautiful day, and he hadn't gone very far before he  heard some fine music.    \"My, there must be a hand-organ around here,\" he said to himself. \"And  perhaps there is another monkey. I'll watch out.\"    So he stood on his hind legs, Uncle Wiggily did, and the music played  louder, and all of a sudden the rabbit looked down the road, and there was  a nice circus, with the white tents, all covered with flags, and bands  playing, and elephants squirting water through their long noses over their  backs to wash the dust off. And lions and tigers were roaring, and the  horses were running, and the fat lady was drinking pink lemonade, and Oh!  it was fine!    \"I've got fifty cents, and I guess I'll go to the circus,\" thought Uncle  Wiggily, and he was just entering the big tent when he happened to see a  man with a lot of red and green and yellow and pink balloons. Now, you  would have thought that man would have been happy, having so many  balloons, but he wasn't. He looked very sad, that man did, and he was  almost crying.    \"Poor man!\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"Perhaps he has no money to go in the  circus. I'll give him mine. Here is fifty cents, Mr. Man,\" said the old  gentleman rabbit, kindly. \"Take it and go see the elephant eat peanuts.\"    \"Oh, that is very good of you,\" spoke the balloon man, \"but I don't want  to go to the circus. I want to sell my balloons, but no one will buy  them.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the rabbit.    \"Oh, because there are so many other things to buy,\" said the man, \"red  peanuts and lemonade in shells--oh, I've got that wrong, it is red  lemonade, isn't it? And peanuts in shells. But no matter. What I need,\"  said the man, \"is to get the people to listen to me--I need to make them  look at me, and when they see what fine balloons I have they'll buy some.  But there are so many other things to look at that they never look toward  me at all.\"    \"Ha! I know the very thing!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"You ought to have some  one go up in a balloon. That would surprise the people like anything.  They'd be sure to look at that, and they'd all run over here and buy all  your balloons.\"    \"Yes, but who can I get to go up in a balloon?\" asked the man.    \"I will!\" cried Uncle Wiggily bravely. \"Perhaps I may find my fortune up  in the sky, so I'll go in a balloon.\"    Well, the man thought that was fine. So he made a little basket for the  rabbit to sit in, and he fastened the basket to a big red balloon, and  then he took care of the rabbit's valise for him, while Uncle Wiggily got  ready to go toward the clouds, taking only his crutch with him.    When the man had everything fixed and when the rabbit was sitting in the  basket as easily as in a soft chair at home, the man cried:    \"Over here! Over here, everybody! Over here, people! A rabbit is going up  in a balloon! A most wonderful sight! Over here!\"    And then the man let go of the balloon, and Uncle Wiggily shot right up  toward the sky, only, of course, the man had a string fast to the balloon  to pull it down again. Up and up went the balloon carrying Uncle Wiggily.  Up and up!    And my! how surprised the people were. They rushed over and bought so many  balloons that the man couldn't take in the money fast enough. And Uncle  Wiggily stayed up there, high in the air, looking for his fortune.    And then, all of a sudden, a bad boy, with a bean shooter, shot at the  balloon, and \"bang!\" it burst, with a big hole in it. Down came Uncle  Wiggily, head over heels, bursted balloon, basket, crutch and all.    \"Oh, he'll be killed! He'll be killed!\" cried all the people.    \"No, he'll not! We'll save him!\" cried Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the  boy and girl sparrow, who happened to be at the circus. \"We'll save Uncle  Wiggily!\"    So up into the air they flew, and before Uncle Wiggily could fall to the  ground Dickie and Nellie grabbed the basket in their bills, and, by  fluttering their wings, they let it come very gently to earth just like a  feather falling, and the rabbit wasn't hurt a bit. But, of course, the  balloon was broken.    So that's how Uncle Wiggily went up in a balloon and came down again, but  he hadn't yet found his fortune. And now in the next story, if our fire  shovel doesn't go out to play in the sand pile, and get its ears full of  dirt, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in an automobile.          STORY XIII    UNCLE WIGGILY IN AN AUTO      Well, after Uncle Wiggily had been saved from the falling balloon by  Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the sparrow children, the people were so  excited that they wanted the bad boy arrested for making a hole in the  balloon with his bean-shooter.    \"No, let him go,\" said the rabbit gentleman, kindly. \"I'm sure he won't do  it again.\" And do you know, that boy never did. It was a good lesson to  him.    Then the people bought all the balloons, until the man had none left, and  I guess if he could have sent for forty-'leven more he would have sold  them also.    \"I will pay you good wages to stay with me, and go up in a balloon every  day,\" said the man to the rabbit. \"You would help me do lots of business.\"    \"No,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I must travel on and seek my fortune. I didn't  find it up in the air.\"    But before the old gentleman rabbit traveled on, he went into the circus  with Dickie and Nellie. For they had an extra ticket that Bully the frog  was going to use, only Bully went in swimming and caught cold, and had to  stay home. So Uncle Wiggily enjoyed the show very much in his place.    \"Give my love to Sammie and Susie Littletail and to all my friends,\" said  the rabbit, as he took his crutch and valise, after the circus was over,  and started to travel on, looking for his fortune.    Well, the first place he came to that day was an old hollow stump, and on  the door was a card which read:    COME IN.    \"Ha! Come in; eh?\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I guess not much! You can't fool  me again. There is a bad bear, or a savage owl inside that stump, and they  want to eat me. I'll just stay outside.\"    He was just hurrying past, when the door of the stump-house opened, and an  old grandfather fox stuck out his head. This fox was almost blind, and he  had no teeth, and he had no claws, and his tail was just like a last  year's dusting brush, that the moths have eaten most up, and altogether  that fox was so old and feeble that he couldn't have hurt a mosquito. So  Uncle Wiggily wasn't a bit afraid of him.    \"I say, is there anything good to eat out there?\" asked the fox, looking  over the tops of his spectacles at the rabbit. \"Anything nice and juicy to  eat?\"    \"Yes, I am good to eat,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"but you are not going to eat  me. Good-by!\"    \"Hold on!\" cried the old fox, \"don't be afraid. I can only eat soup, for I  have no teeth to chew with, so unless you are soup you are of no use to  me.\"    \"Well, I'm not soup, but I know how to make some,\" replied the rabbit, for  he felt sorry for the grandfather fox.    So what do you think our Uncle Wiggily did? Why, he went into the fox's  stump-house and made a big pot full of the finest kind of soup, and the  rabbit and the fox ate it all up, and, because the fox had no teeth or  claws, he couldn't hurt his visitor.    \"I wish you would stay with me forever,\" said the old fox, as he blinked  his eyes at Uncle Wiggily. \"I have a young and strong grandson coming home  soon, and you might show him how to make soup.\"    \"No, thank you,\" replied the rabbit. \"I'm afraid that young and strong  grandson of yours would want to eat me instead of the soup, I guess I'll  travel on.\" So the old gentleman rabbit took his crutch and valise and  traveled on.    Well, pretty soon, it began to get dark, and Uncle Wiggily knew night was  coming on. And he wondered where he could stay, for he didn't see any  haystacks to sleep under. He was thinking that he'd have to dig a burrow  in the ground for himself, and he was looking for a soft place to begin,  when, all at once, he heard a loud \"Honk-Honk!\" back of him in the road.    \"Ha, an automobile is coming!\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I must get out of the  way!\" So he hopped on ahead, going down the road quite fast, until he got  to a place where there were prickly briar bushes on both sides of the  highway.    \"My! I'll have to keep in the middle of the road if I don't want to get  scratched,\" said the rabbit. And then the automobile horn behind him  honked louder than ever.    \"They are certainly coming along fast,\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"If I don't  look out I'll be run over.\" So he hopped along quicker than before, until,  all of a sudden, as he looked down the road, he saw a savage dog standing  there.    \"Well, now! Isn't that just my bad luck!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"If I go on  the dog will catch me, and if I stand here the auto will run on top of me.  I just guess I'll run back and see if there is a hole where I can crawl  through the bushes.\"    So he started to run back, but, no sooner had he done so, than the dog saw  him, and came rushing at him with a loud, \"Bow-wow-wow! Bow-wow-wow!\"    \"My, but he's savage!\" thought the rabbit. \"I wonder if I can get away in  time?\"    And then the auto honked louder than before, and all of a sudden it came  whizzing down the road, right toward the rabbit.    \"Oh, dear; I'm going to be caught, sure!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, and indeed  it did look so, for there was the dog running from one direction, and the  auto coming in the other, and prickly briar bushes were on both sides of  the road, and Uncle Wiggily couldn't crawl through them without pulling  all the fur off his back, and his ears, too.    \"Honk-Honk!\" went the auto.    \"Bow-wow!\" went the dog.    \"Oh,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#9)"],[1,"active, each leaving its impress of which the  cities become, as it were, repositories.    [Sidenote: Effect of a previous habitat.]    The importance of this time element for a solution of  anthropo-geographic problems becomes plainer, where a certain locality  has received an entirely new population, or where a given people by  migration change their habitat. The result in either case is the same, a  new combination, new modifications superimposed on old modifications.  And it is with this sort of case that anthropo-geography most often has  to deal. So restless has mankind been, that the testimony of history and  ethnology is all against the assumption that a social group has ever  been subjected to but one type of environment during its long period of  development from a primitive to a civilized society. Therefore, if we  assert that a people is the product of the country which it inhabits at  a given time, we forget that many different countries which its forbears  occupied have left their mark on the present race in the form of  inherited aptitudes and traditional customs acquired in those remote  ancestral habitats. The Moors of Granada had passed through a wide range  of ancestral experiences; they bore the impress of Asia, Africa and  Europe, and on their expulsion from Spain carried back with them to  Morocco traces of their peninsula life.    A race or tribe develops certain characteristics in a certain region,  then moves on, leaving the old abode but not all the accretions of  custom, social organization and economic method there acquired. These  travel on with the migrant people; some are dropped, others are  preserved because of utility, sentiment or mere habit. For centuries  after the settlement of the Jews in Palestine, traces of their pastoral  life in the grasslands of Mesopotamia could be discerned in their social  and political organization, in their ritual and literature. Survivals of  their nomadic life in Asiatic steppes still persist among the Turks of  Europe, after six centuries of sedentary life in the best agricultural  land of the Balkan Peninsula. One of these appears in their choice of  meat. They eat chiefly sheep and goats, beef very rarely, and swine not  at all.[29] The first two thrive on poor pastures and travel well, so  that they are admirably adapted to nomadic life in arid lands; the last  two, far less so, but on the other hand are the regular concomitant of  agricultural life. The Turk's taste to-day, therefore, is determined by  the flocks and herds which he once pastured on the Trans-Caspian plains.  The finished terrace agriculture and methods of irrigation, which the  Saracens had learned on the mountain sides of Yemen through a schooling  of a thousand years or more, facilitated their economic conquest of  Spain. Their intelligent exploitation of the country's resources for the  support of their growing numbers in the favorable climatic conditions  which Spain offered was a light-hearted task, because of the severe  training which they had had in their Arabian home.    The origin of Roman political institutions is intimately connected with  conditions of the naturally small territory where arose the greatness of  Rome. But now, after two thousand years we see the political impress of  this narrow origin spreading to the governments of an area of Europe  immeasurably larger than the region that gave it birth. In the United  States, little New England has been the source of the strongest  influences modifying the political, religious and cultural life of half  a continent; and as far as Texas and California these influences bear  the stamp of that narrow, unproductive environment which gave to its  sons energy of character and ideals.    [Sidenote: Transplanted religions.]    Ideas especially are light baggage, and travel with migrant peoples  over many a long and rough road. They are wafted like winged seed by the  wind, and strike root in regions where they could never have originated.  Few classes of ideas bear so plainly the geographic stamp of their  origin as religious ones, yet none have spread more widely. The abstract  monotheism sprung from the bare grasslands of western Asia made slow but  final headway against the exuberant forest gods of the early Germans.  Religious ideas travel far from their seedbeds along established lines  of communication. We have the almost amusing episode of the brawny  Burgundians of the fifth century, who received the Arian form of  Christianity by way of the Danube highway from the schools of Athens and  Alexandria, valiantly supporting the niceties of Greek religious thought  against the Roman version of the faith which came up the Rhone Valley.    If the sacred literature of Judaism and Christianity take weak hold upon  the western mind, this is largely because it is written in the symbolism  of the pastoral nomad. Its figures of speech reflect life in deserts and  grasslands. For these figures the western mind has few or vague  corresponding ideas. It loses, therefore, half the import, for instance,  of the Twenty-third Psalm, that picture of the nomad shepherd guiding  his flock across parched and trackless plains, to bring them at evening,  weary, hungry, thirsty, to the fresh pastures and waving palms of some  oasis, whose green tints stand out in vivid contrast to the tawny wastes  of the encompassing sands. \"He leadeth me beside the still waters,\" not  the noisy rushing stream of the rainy lands, but the quiet desert pool  that reflects the stars. What real significance has the tropical  radiance of the lotus flower, the sacred symbol of Buddhism, for the  Mongolian lama in the cold and arid borders of Gobi or the wind-swept  highlands of sterile Tibet? And yet these exotic ideas live on, even if  they no longer bloom in the uncongenial soil. But to explain them in  terms of their present environment would be indeed impossible.    [Sidenote: Partial response to environment]    A people may present at any given time only a partial response to their  environment also for other reasons. This may be either because their  arrival has been too recent for the new habitat to make its influence  felt; or because, even after long residence, one overpowering  geographic factor has operated to the temporary exclusion of all others.  Under these circumstances, suddenly acquired geographic advantages of a  high order or such advantages, long possessed but tardily made available  by the release of national powers from more pressing tasks, may  institute a new trend of historical development, resulting more from  stimulating geographic conditions than from the natural capacities or  aptitudes of the people themselves. Such developments, though often  brilliant, are likely to be short-lived and to end suddenly or  disastrously, because not sustained by a deep-seated national impulse  animating the whole mass of the people. They cease when the first  enthusiasm spends itself, or when outside competition is intensified, or  the material rewards decrease.    [Sidenote: The case of Spain.]    An illustration is found in the mediaeval history of Spain. The  intercontinental location of the Iberian Peninsula exposed it to the  Saracen conquest and to the constant reinforcements to Islam power  furnished by the Mohammedanized Berbers of North Africa. For seven  centuries this location was the dominant geographic factor in Spain's  history. It made the expulsion of the Moors the sole object of all the  Iberian states, converted the country into an armed camp, made the  gentleman adventurer and Christian knight the national ideal. It placed  the center of political control high up on the barren plateau of  Castile, far from the centers of population and culture in the river  lowlands or along the coast. It excluded the industrial and commercial  development which was giving bone and sinew to the other European  states. The release of the national energies by the fall of Granada in  1492 and the now ingrained spirit of adventure enabled Spain and  Portugal to utilize the unparalleled advantage of their geographical  position at the junction of the Mediterranean and Atlantic highways, and  by their great maritime explorations in the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries, to become foremost among European colonial powers. But the  development was sporadic, not supported by any widespread national  movement. In a few decades the maritime preeminence of the Iberian  Peninsula began to yield to the competition of the Dutch and English,  who were, so to speak, saturated with their own maritime environment.  Then followed the rapid decay of the sea power of Spain, followed by  that of Portugal, till by 1648 even her coasting trade was in the hands  of the Dutch, and Dutch vessels were employed to maintain communication  with the West Indies.[30]    [Sidenote: Sporadic response to a new environment.]    We have a later instance of sporadic development under the stimulus of  new and favorable geographic conditions, a similar anti-climax. The  expansion of the Russians across the lowlands of Siberia was quite in  harmony with the genius of that land-bred people; but when they reached  Bering Sea, the enclosed basin, the proximity of the American continent,  the island stepping-stones between, and the lure of rich sealskins to  the fur-hunting Cossacks determined a sudden maritime expansion, for  which the Russian people were unfitted. Beginning in 1747, it swept the  coast of Alaska, located its American administrative center first on  Kadiak, then on Baranof Island, and by 1812 placed its southern outposts  on the California coast near San Francisco Bay and on the Farralone  Islands.[31] Russian convicts were employed to man the crazy boats built  of green lumber on the shores of Bering Sea, and Aleutian hunters with  their _bidarkas_ were impressed to catch the seal.[32] The movement was  productive only of countless shipwrecks, many seal skins,"]]]
