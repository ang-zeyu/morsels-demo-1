It was an opportunity not to miss--she had not the courage  to let it pass--and yet it required almost as much to ring the bell. And  even as she rang--but not until that moment--did Rachel recognize and  admit to herself the motive which had brought her to that door. It was  not to obtain the advice of a clever man; it was the sympathy of another  woman that she needed that night more than anything else in all the  world.    She was shown at once into the study behind the dining-room, and  immediately the voices in the latter ceased. This was ominous; it was  for Mrs. Carrington that Rachel had asked; and the omen was instantly  fulfilled. It was Mr. Carrington who came into the room, dark, dapper,  and duskily flushed with his own hospitality, but without the genial  front which Rachel had liked best in him. His voice also, when he had  carefully shut the door behind him, was unnaturally stiff.    \"I congratulate you,\" he said, with a bow but nothing more; and Rachel  saw there and then how it was to be; for with her at least this man had  never been stiff before, having indeed offended her with his familiarity  at the time when her husband and he were best friends.    \"I owe it very largely to you,\" faltered Rachel. \"How can I thank you?\"    Carrington said it was not necessary.    \"Then I only hope,\" said Rachel, on one of her impulses, \"that you don't  disagree with the verdict?\"    \"I didn't read the case,\" replied Carrington glibly, and with neither  more nor less of the contemptuous superiority with which he would have  referred to any other Old Bailey trial; but the man himself was quick to  see the brutality of such a statement, and quicker yet to tone it down.    \"It wasn't necessary,\" he added, with a touch of the early manner which  she had never liked; \"you see, I knew you.\"    The insincerity was so obvious that Rachel could scarcely bring herself  to confess that she had come to ask his advice. \"What was the point?\" he  said to that, so crisply that the only point which Rachel could think of  was the fresh, raw grievance of the empty house.    \"Didn't your solicitor tell you?\" asked Carrington. \"He came to me about  it; but I suppose--\"    Rachel knew well what he supposed.    \"He should have told you to-night,\" added Carrington, \"at any rate. The  rent was only paid for half the term--quite right--the usual way. The  permanent tenant wanted to be done with the house altogether, and that  entitled her to take her things out. No, I'm afraid you have no  grievance there, Mrs. Minchin.\"    \"And pray,\" demanded Rachel, \"where are my things?\"    \"Ah, your solicitor will tell you that--when you give him the chance! He  very properly would not care to bother you about trifles until the case  against you was satisfactorily disposed of. By the way, I hope you don't  mind my cigar? We were smoking in the next room.\"    \"I have taken you from your guests,\" said Rachel, miserably. \"I know I  ought not to have come at such an hour.\"    Carrington did not contradict her.    \"But there seemed so much to speak about,\" she went desperately on.  \"There are the money matters and--and--\"    \"If you will come to my chambers,\" said Carrington, \"I shall be  delighted to go into things with you, and to advise you to the best of  my ability. If you could manage to come at half-past nine on Monday  morning, I would be there early and could give you twenty minutes.\"    He wrote down the address, and, handing it to Rachel, rang the bell.  This drove her to despair; evidently it never occurred to him that she  was faint with weariness and hunger, that she had nowhere to go for the  night, and not the price of a decent meal, much less a bed, in her  purse. And even now her pride prevented her from telling the truth; but  it would not silence her supreme desire.    \"Oh!\" she cried; \"oh, may I not speak to your wife?\"    \"Not to-night, if you don't mind,\" replied Carrington, with his bow and  smile. \"We can't both desert our guests.\"    \"Only for a minute!\" pleaded Rachel. \"I wouldn't keep her more!\"    \"Not to-night,\" he repeated, with a broader smile, a clearer  enunciation, and a decision so obviously irrevocable that Rachel said no  more. But she would not see the hand that he could afford to hold out to  her now; and as for going near his chambers, never, never, though she  starved!    \"No, I wouldn't have kept her,\" she sobbed in the street; \"but she would  have kept me! I know her! I know her! She would have had pity on me, in  spite of him; but now I can never go near either of them again!\"    Then where was she to go? God knew! No respectable hotel would take her  in without luggage or a deposit. What was she to do?    But while she wondered her feet were carrying her once more in the old  direction, and as she walked an idea came. She was very near the fatal  little street at the time. She turned about, and then to the left. In a  few moments she was timorously knocking at the door of a house with a  card in the window.    \"It's you!\" cried the woman who came, almost shutting the door in  Rachel's face, leaving just space enough for her own.    \"You have a room to let,\" said Rachel, steadily.    \"But not to you,\" said the woman, quickly; and Rachel was not  surprised, the other was so pale, so strangely agitated.    \"But why?\" she asked. \"I have been acquitted--thanks partly to your own  evidence--and yet you of all women will not take me in! Do you mean to  tell me that you actually think I did it still?\"    Rachel fully expected an affirmative. She was prepared for that opinion  now from all the world; but for once a surprise was in store for her.  The pale woman shifted her eyes, then raised them doggedly, and the look  in them brought a sudden glow to Rachel's heart.    \"No, I don't think that, and never did,\" said the one independent  witness for the defence. \"But others do, and I am too near where it  happened; it might empty my house and keep it empty.\"    Rachel seized her hand.    \"Never mind, never mind,\" she whispered. \"It is better, ten thousand  times, that you should believe in me, that any woman should! Thank you,  and God bless you, for that!\"    She was turning away, when she faced about upon the steps, gazing past  the woman who believed in her, along the passage beyond, an unspoken  question beneath the tears in her eyes.    \"He is not here,\" said the landlady, quickly.    \"But he did get over it?\"    \"So we hope; but he was at death's door that morning, and for days and  weeks. Now he's abroad again--I'm sure I don't know where.\"    Rachel said good-night, and this time the door not only shut before she  had time to change her mind again, but she heard the bolts shot as she  reached the pavement. The fact did not strike her. She was thinking for  a moment of the innocent young foreigner who had brought matters to a  crisis between her husband and herself. On the whole she was glad that  he was not in England--yet there would have been one friend.    And now her own case was really desperate; it was late at night; she was  famished and worn out in body and mind, nor could she see the slightest  prospect of a lodging for the night.    And that she would have had in the condemned cell, with food and warmth  and rest, and the blessed certainty of a speedy issue out of all her  afflictions.    It was a bitter irony, after all, this acquittal!    There was but one place for her now. She would perish there of cold and  horror; but she might buy something to eat, and take it with her; and at  least she could rest, and would be alone, in the empty house, the house  of misery and murder, that was yet the one shelter that she knew of in  all London.    She crept to the King's road, and returned with a few sandwiches,  walking better in her eagerness to break a fast which she had only felt  since excitement had given place to despair. But now it was making her  faint and ill. And she hurried, weary though she was.    But in the little street itself she stood aghast. A crowd filled it; the  crowd stood before the empty house of sorrow and of crime; and in a  moment Rachel saw the cause.    It was her own fault. She had left the light burning in the upper room,  the bedroom on the second floor.    Rachel joined the skirts of the crowd--drawn by an irresistible  fascination--and listened to what was being said. All eyes were upon the  lighted window of the bedroom--watching for herself, as she soon  discovered--and this made her doubly safe where she stood behind the  press.    \"She's up there, I tell yer,\" said one.    \"Not her! It's a ghost.\"    \"Her 'usband's ghost, then.\"    \"But vere's a chap 'ere wot sore 'er fice to fice in the next street;  an' followed 'er and 'eard the door go; an' w'en 'e come back wiv 'is  pals, vere was vat light.\"    \"Let's 'ave 'er aht of it.\"    \"Yuss, she ain't no right there.\"    \"No; the condemned cell's the plice for 'er!\"    \"Give us a stone afore the copper comes!\"    And Rachel saw the first stone flung, and heard the first glass break;  and within a very few minutes there was not a whole pane left in the  front of the house; but that was all the damage which Rachel herself saw  done.    A hand touched her lightly on the shoulder.    \"Do you still pin your faith to the man in the street?\" said a voice.    And, though she had heard it for the first time that very evening, it  was a voice that Rachel seemed to have known all her life.          CHAPTER VI    A PERIPATETIC PROVIDENCE      \"Do you still pin your faith to the man in the street?\"    It was Mr. Steel who stood at Rachel's elbow, repeating his question  word for word; but he did not repeat it in the same tone. There was an  earnest note in the lowered voice, an unspoken appeal to her to admit  the truth and be done with proud pretence. And indeed the pride had gone  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#9)"],[1,"voice, and those  dark eyes which were raised shyly, yet bravely, to his. But he had  been deeply hurt. He pretended not to see the friendly hand held out  to him, and his voice was cold when he answered her.    \"I am glad to have been of some service,\" he said, \"but I think you  overrate my action. Your brother would not have drowned, I am sure.  You owe me nothing. Good-night.\"    Betty stood still one moment staring at the door through which he  had gone before she realized that her overtures of friendship had  been politely, but coldly, ignored. She had actually been snubbed.  The impossible had happened to Elizabeth Zane. Her first sensation  after she recovered from her momentary bewilderment was one of  amusement, and she laughed in a constrained manner; but, presently,  two bright red spots appeared in her cheeks, and she looked quickly  around to see if any of the others had noticed the incident. None of  them had been paying any attention to her and she breathed a sigh of  relief. It was bad enough to be snubbed without having others see  it. That would have been too humiliating. Her eyes flashed fire as  she remembered the disdain in Clarke's face, and that she had not  been clever enough to see it in time.    \"Tige, come here!\" called Colonel Zane. \"What ails the dog?\"    The dog had jumped to his feet and ran to the door, where he sniffed  at the crack over the threshold. His aspect was fierce and  threatening. He uttered low growls and then two short barks. Those  in the room heard a soft moccasined footfall outside. The next  instant the door opened wide and a tall figure stood disclosed.    \"Wetzel!\" exclaimed Colonel Zane. A hush fell on the little company  after that exclamation, and all eyes were fastened on the new comer.    Well did the stranger merit close attention. He stalked into the  room, leaned his long rifle against the mantelpiece and spread out  his hands to the fire. He was clad from head to foot in fringed and  beaded buckskin, which showed evidence of a long and arduous tramp.  It was torn and wet and covered with mud. He was a magnificently  made man, six feet in height, and stood straight as an arrow. His  wide shoulders, and his muscular, though not heavy, limbs denoted  wonderful strength and activity. His long hair, black as a raven's  wing, hung far down his shoulders. Presently he turned and the light  shone on a remarkable face. So calm and cold and stern it was that  it seemed chiselled out of marble. The most striking features were  its unusual pallor, and the eyes, which were coal black, and  piercing as the dagger's point.    \"If you have any bad news out with it,\" cried Colonel Zane,  impatiently.    \"No need fer alarm,\" said Wetzel. He smiled slightly as he saw  Betty's apprehensive face. \"Don't look scared, Betty. The redskins  are miles away and goin' fer the Kanawha settlement.\"        CHAPTER III.    Many weeks of quiet followed the events of the last chapter. The  settlers planted their corn, harvested their wheat and labored in  the fields during the whole of one spring and summer without hearing  the dreaded war cry of the Indians. Colonel Zane, who had been a  disbursing officer in the army of Lord Dunmore, where he had  attained the rank of Colonel, visited Fort Pitt during the summer in  the hope of increasing the number of soldiers in his garrison. His  efforts proved fruitless. He returned to Fort Henry by way of the  river with several pioneers, who with their families were bound for  Fort Henry. One of these pioneers was a minister who worked in the  fields every week day and on Sundays preached the Gospel to those  who gathered in the meeting house.    Alfred Clarke had taken up his permanent abode at the fort, where he  had been installed as one of the regular garrison. His duties, as  well as those of the nine other members of the garrison, were light.  For two hours out of the twenty-four he was on guard. Thus he had  ample time to acquaint himself with the settlers and their families.    Alfred and Isaac had now become firm friends. They spent many hours  fishing in the river, and roaming the woods in the vicinity, as  Colonel Zane would not allow Isaac to stray far from the fort.  Alfred became a regular visitor at Colonel Zane's house. He saw  Betty every day, but as yet, nothing had mended the breach between  them. They were civil to each other when chance threw them together,  but Betty usually left the room on some pretext soon after he  entered. Alfred regretted his hasty exhibition of resentment and  would have been glad to establish friendly relations with her. But  she would not give him an opportunity. She avoided him on all  possible occasions. Though Alfred was fast succumbing to the charm  of Betty's beautiful face, though his desire to be near her had  grown well nigh resistless, his pride had not yet broken down. Many  of the summer evenings found him on the Colonel's doorstep, smoking  a pipe, or playing with the children. He was that rare and best  company--a good listener. Although he laughed at Colonel Zane's  stories, and never tired of hearing of Isaac's experiences among the  Indians, it is probable he would not have partaken of the Colonel's  hospitality nearly so often had it not been that he usually saw  Betty, and if he got only a glimpse of her he went away satisfied.  On Sundays he attended the services at the little church and  listened to Betty's sweet voice as she led the singing.    There were a number of girls at the fort near Betty's age. With all  of these Alfred was popular. He appeared so entirely different from  the usual young man on the frontier that he was more than welcome  everywhere. Girls in the backwoods are much the same as girls in  thickly populated and civilized districts. They liked his manly  ways; his frank and pleasant manners; and when to these virtues he  added a certain deferential regard, a courtliness to which they were  unaccustomed, they were all the better pleased. He paid the young  women little attentions, such as calling on them, taking them to  parties and out driving, but there was not one of them who could  think that she, in particular, interested him.    The girls noticed, however, that he never approached Betty after  service, or on any occasion, and while it caused some wonder and  gossip among them, for Betty enjoyed the distinction of being the  belle of the border, they were secretly pleased. Little hints and  knowing smiles, with which girls are so skillful, made known to  Betty all of this, and, although she was apparently indifferent, it  hurt her sensitive feelings. It had the effect of making her believe  she hated the cause of it more than ever.    What would have happened had things gone on in this way, I am not  prepared to say; probably had not a meddling Fate decided to take a  hand in the game, Betty would have continued to think she hated  Alfred, and I would never have had occasion to write his story; but  Fate did interfere, and, one day in the early fall, brought about an  incident which changed the whole world for the two young people.    It was the afternoon of an Indian summer day--in that most beautiful  time of all the year--and Betty, accompanied by her dog, had  wandered up the hillside into the woods. From the hilltop the broad  river could be seen winding away in the distance, and a soft,  bluish, smoky haze hung over the water. The forest seemed to be on  fire. The yellow leaves of the poplars, the brown of the white and  black oaks, the red and purple of the maples, and the green of the  pines and hemlocks flamed in a glorious blaze of color. A stillness,  which was only broken now and then by the twittering of birds  uttering the plaintive notes peculiar to them in the autumn as they  band together before their pilgrimage to the far south, pervaded the  forest.    Betty loved the woods, and she knew all the trees. She could tell  their names by the bark or the shape of the leaves. The giant black  oak, with its smooth shiny bark and sturdy limbs, the chestnut with  its rugged, seamed sides and bristling burrs, the hickory with its  lofty height and curled shelling bark, were all well known and well  loved by Betty. Many times had she wondered at the trembling,  quivering leaves of the aspen, and the foliage of the silver-leaf as  it glinted in the sun. To-day, especially, as she walked through the  woods, did their beauty appeal to her. In the little sunny patches  of clearing which were scattered here and there in the grove, great  clusters of goldenrod grew profusely. The golden heads swayed  gracefully on the long stems Betty gathered a few sprigs and added  to them a bunch of warmly tinted maple leaves.    The chestnuts burrs were opening. As Betty mounted a little rocky  eminence and reached out for a limb of a chestnut tree, she lost her  footing and fell. Her right foot had twisted under her as she went  down, and when a sharp pain shot through it she was unable to  repress a cry. She got up, tenderly placed the foot on the ground  and tried her weight on it, which caused acute pain. She unlaced and  removed her moccasin to find that her ankle had commenced to swell.  Assured that she had sprained it, and aware of the serious  consequences of an injury of that nature, she felt greatly  distressed. Another effort to place her foot on the ground and bear  her weight on it caused such severe pain that she was compelled to  give up the attempt. Sinking down by the trunk of the tree and  leaning her head against it she tried to think of a way out of her  difficulty.    The fort, which she could plainly see, seemed a long distance off,  although it was only a little way down the grassy slope. She looked  and looked, but not a person was to be seen. She called to Tige. She  remembered that he had been chasing a squirrel a short while ago,  but now there was no sign of him. He did not come at her call. How  annoying! If Tige were only there "]]]
