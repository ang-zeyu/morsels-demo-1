They halted upon the pass and prayed, and waited for any sign.  For a man's totem may be in the likeness perhaps of an otter, and a  man may pray, and if his totem be placable and watching over his man a  noise may be heard at once like the noise that the otter makes, though  it be but a stone that falls on another stone; and the noise is a  sign. The four men's totems that stood so far away were in the  likeness of the coney, the bear, the heron, and the lizard. They  waited, and no sign came. With all the noises of the wind in the  abyss, no noise was like the thump that the coney makes, nor the  bear's growl, nor the heron's screech, nor the rustle of the lizard in  the reeds.    It seemed that the wind was saying something over and over again, and  that that thing was evil. They prayed again to their totems, and no  sign came. And then they knew that there was some power that night  that was prevailing against the pleasant carvings on painted poles of  wood with the firelight on their faces so far away. Now it was clear  that the wind was saying something, some very, very dreadful thing in  a tongue that they did not know. They listened, but they could not  tell what it said. Nobody could have said from seeing their faces how  much the four tall men desired the wigwams again, desired the  camp-fire and the tales of war and the benignant totems that listened  and smiled in the dusk: nobody could have seen how well they knew that  this was no common night or wholesome mist.    When at last no answer came nor any sign from their totems, they  pulled out of the bag those golden gods that Loma gave not up except  in flames and when all her men were dead. They had large ruby eyes and  emerald tongues. They set them down upon that mountain pass, the  cross-legged idols with their emerald tongues; and having placed  between them a few decent yards, as it seemed meet there should be  between gods and men, they bowed them down and prayed in their  desperate straits in that dank, ominous night to the gods they had  wronged, for it seemed that there was a vengeance upon the hills and  that they would scarce escape, as the wind knew well. And the gods  laughed, all four, and wagged their emerald tongues; the Indians saw  them, though the night had fallen and though the mist was low. The  four tall men leaped up at once from their knees and would have left  the gods upon the pass but that they feared some hunter of their tribe  might one day find them and say of Laughing Face, \"He fled and left  behind his golden gods,\" and sell the gold and come with his wealth to  the wigwams and be greater than Laughing Face and his three men. And  then they would have cast the gods away, down the abyss, with their  eyes and their emerald tongues, but they knew that enough already they  had wronged Loma's gods, and feared that vengeance enough was waiting  them on the hills. So they packed them back in the bag on the  frightened mule, the bag that held the curse they knew nothing of, and  so pushed on into the menacing night. Till midnight they plodded on  and would not sleep; grimmer and grimmer grew the look of the night,  and the wind more full of meaning, and the mule knew and trembled, and  it seemed that the wind knew, too, as did the instincts of those four  tall men, though they could not reason it out, try how they would.    And though the squaws waited long where the pass winds out of the  mountains, near where the wigwams are upon the plains, the wigwams and  the totems and the fire, and though they watched by day, and for many  nights uttered familiar calls, still did they never see those four  tall men emerge out of the mountains any more, even though they prayed  to their totems upon their painted poles; but the curse in the  mystical writing that they had unknown in their bag worked there on  that lonely pass six leagues from the ruins of Loma, and nobody can  tell us what it was.            The Secret of the Sea    In an ill-lit ancient tavern that I know, are many tales of the sea;  but not without the wine of Gorgondy, that I had of a private bargain  from the gnomes, was the tale laid bare for which I had waited of an  evening for the greater part of a year.    I knew my man and listened to his stories, sitting amid the bluster of  his oaths; I plied him with rum and whiskey and mixed drinks, but  there never came the tale for which I sought, and as a last resort I  went to the Huthneth Mountains and bargained there all night with the  chiefs of the gnomes.    When I came to the ancient tavern and entered the low-roofed room,  bringing the hoard of the gnomes in a bottle of hammered iron, my man  had not yet arrived. The sailors laughed at my old iron bottle, but I  sat down and waited; had I opened it then they would have wept and  sung. I was well content to wait, for I knew my man had the story, and  it was such a one as had profoundly stirred the incredulity of the  faithless.    He entered and greeted me, and sat down and called for brandy. He was  a hard man to turn from his purpose, and, uncorking my iron bottle, I  sought to dissuade him from brandy for fear that when the brandy, bit  his throat he should refuse to leave it for any other wine. He lifted  his head and said deep and dreadful things of any man that should dare  to speak against brandy.    I swore that I said nothing against brandy but added that it was often  given to children, while Gorgondy was only drunk by men of such  depravity that they had abandoned sin because all the usual vices had  come to seem genteel. When he asked if Gorgondy was a bad wine to  drink I said that it was so bad that if a man sipped it that was the  one touch that made damnation certain. Then he asked me what I had in  the iron bottle, and I said it was Gorgondy; and then he shouted for  the largest tumbler in that ill-lit ancient tavern, and stood up and  shook his fist at me when it came, and swore, and told me to fill it  with the wine that I got on that bitter night from the treasure house  of the gnomes.    As he drank it he told me that he had met men who had spoken against  wine, and that they had mentioned Heaven; and therefore he would not  go there--no, not he; and that once he had sent one of them to Hell,  but when he got there he would turn him out, and he had no use for  milksops.    Over the second tumbler he was thoughtful, but still he said no word  of the tale he knew, until I feared that it would never be heard. But  when the third glass of that terrific wine had burned its way down his  gullet, and vindicated the wickedness of the gnomes, his reticence  withered like a leaf in the fire, and he bellowed out the secret.    I had long known that there is in ships a will or way of their own,  and had even suspected that when sailors die or abandon their ships at  sea, a derelict, being left to her own devices, may seek her own ends;  but I had never dreamed by night, or fancied during the day, that the  ships had a god that they worshipped, or that they secretly slipped  away to a temple in the sea.    Over the fourth glass of the wine that the gnomes so sinfully brew but  have kept so wisely from man, until the bargain that I had with their  elders all through that autumn night, the sailor told me the story. I  do not tell it as he told it to me because of the oaths that were in  it; nor is it from delicacy that I refrain from writing these oaths  verbatim, but merely because the horror they caused in me at the time  troubles me still whenever I put them on paper, and I continue to  shudder until I have blotted them out. Therefore, I tell the story in  my own words, which, if they possess a certain decency that was not in  the mouth of that sailor, unfortunately do not smack, as his did, of  rum and blood and the sea.    You would take a ship to be a dead thing like a table, as dead as bits  of iron and canvas and wood. That is because you always live on shore,  and have never seen the sea, and drink milk. Milk is a more accursed  drink than water.    What with the captain and what with the man at the wheel, and what  with the crew, a ship has no fair chance of showing a will of her own.    There is only one moment in the history of ships, that carry crews on  board, when they act by their own free will. This moment comes when  all the crew are drunk. As the last man falls drunk on to the deck,  the ship is free of man, and immediately slips away. She slips away at  once on a new course and is never one yard out in a hundred miles.    It was like this one night with the Sea-Fancy. Bill Smiles was there  himself, and can vouch for it. Bill Smiles has never told this tale  before for fear that anyone should call him a liar. Nobody dislikes  being hung as much as Bill Smiles would, but he won't be called a  liar. I tell the tale as I heard it, relevancies and irrelevancies,  though in my more decent words; and as I made no doubts of the truth  of it then, I hardly like to now; others can please themselves.    It is not often that the whole of a crew is drunk. The crew of  the Sea-Fancy was no drunkener than others. It happened like this.    The captain was always drunk. One day a fancy he had that some spiders  were plotting against him, or a sudden bleeding he had from both his  ears, made him think that drinking might be bad for his health. Next  day he signed the pledge. He was sober all that morning and all the  afternoon, but at evening he saw a sailor drinking a a glass of beer,  and a fit of madness seized him, and he said things that seemed bad to  Bill Smiles. And next morning he made all of them take the pledge.    For two days nobody had a drop to drink, unless you count water, and  on the third morning the captain was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#9)"],[1," thousand years it lost  all self-consciousness. Indeed the modern clear demarcation between  the native and the imported religions is a matter of only a few  decades, due to the researches of native scholars during the latter  part of the last and the early part of this century. Even now,  multitudes of the common people know no difference between the various  elements of the composite religion of which they are the heirs.    Moreover, early contact with China and her enormous literature checked  the development of the native language and the growth of the native  literature. The language suffered arrest because of the rapid  introduction of Chinese terms for all the growing needs of thought and  civilization. Modern Japanese is a compound of the original tongue and  Japonicized Chinese. Native speculative thought likewise found little  encouragement or stimulus to independent activity in the presence of  the elaborate and in many respects profound philosophies brought from  India and China.    From earliest times the government of Japan was essentially feudal.  Powerful families and clans disputed and fought for leadership, and  the political history of Japan revolves around the varying fortunes of  these families. While the Imperial line is never lost to sight, it  seldom rises to real power.    When, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Japan's conquering arm  reached across the waters, to ravage the coast of China, to extend her  influence as far south as Siam, and even to invade Korea with a large  army in 1592, it looked as if she were well started on her career as a  world-power. But that was not yet to be. The hegemony of her clans  passed into the powerful and shrewd Tokugawa family, the policy of  which was peace and national self-sufficiency.    The representatives of the Occidental nations (chiefly of Spain and  Portugal) were banished. The Christian religion (Roman Catholic),  which for over fifty years had enjoyed free access and had made great  progress, was forbidden and stamped out, not without much bloodshed.  Foreign travel and commerce were strictly interdicted. A particular  school of Confucian ethics was adopted and taught as the state  religion. Feudalism was systematically established and intentionally  developed. Each and every man had his assigned and recognized place in  the social fabric, and change was not easy. It is doubtful if any  European country has ever given feudalism so long and thorough a  trial. Never has feudalism attained so complete a development as it  did in Japan under the Tokugawa regime of over 250 years.    During this period no influences came from other lands to disturb the  natural development. With the exception of three ships a year from  Holland, an occasional stray ship from other lands, and from fifteen  to twenty Dutchmen isolated in a little island in the harbor of  Nagasaki, Japan had no communication with foreign lands or alien  peoples.    Of this period, extending to the middle of the present century, the  ordinary visitor and even the resident have but a superficial  knowledge. All the changes that have taken place in Japan, since the  coming of Perry in 1854, are attributed by the easy-going tourist to  the external pressure of foreign nations. But such travelers know  nothing of the internal preparations that had been making for  generations previous to the arrival of Perry. The tourist is quite  ignorant of the line of Japanese scholars that had been undermining  the authority of the military rulers, \"the Tokugawa,\" in favor of the  Imperial line which they had practically supplanted.    The casual student of Japan has been equally ignorant of the real  mental and moral caliber of the Japanese. Dressed in clothing that  appeared to us fantastic, and armed with cumbersome armor and  old-fashioned guns, it was easy to jump to the conclusion that the  people were essentially uncivilized. We did not know the intellectual  discipline demanded of one, whether native or foreign, who would  master the native language or the native systems of thought. We forgot  that we appeared as grotesque and as barbarous to them as they to us,  and that mental ability and moral worth are qualities that do not show  on the surface of a nation's civilization. While they thought us to be  \"unclean,\" \"dogs,\" \"red-haired devils,\" we perhaps thought them to be  clever savages, or at best half-civilized heathen, without moral  perceptions or intellectual ability.    Of Old Japan little more needs to be said. Without external commerce,  there was little need for internal trade; ships were small; roads were  footpaths; education was limited to the samurai, or military class,  retainers of the daimyo, \"feudal lords\"; inter-clan travel was limited  and discouraged; Confucian ethics was the moral standard. From the  beginning of the seventeenth century Christianity was forbidden by  edict, and was popularly known as the \"evil way\"; Japan was thought to  be especially sacred, and the coming of foreigners was supposed to  pollute the land and to be the cause of physical evils. Education, as  in China, was limited to the Chinese classics. Mathematics, general  history, and science, in the modern sense, were of course wholly  unknown. Guns and powder were brought from the West in the sixteenth  century by Spaniards and Portuguese, but were never improved.  Ship-building was the same in the middle of the nineteenth century as  in the middle of the sixteenth, perhaps even less advanced.  Architecture had received its great impulse from the introduction of  Buddhism in the ninth and tenth centuries and had made no material  improvement thereafter.    But while there was little progress in the external and mechanical  elements of civilization, there was progress in other respects. During  the \"great peace,\" first arose great scholars. Culture became more  general throughout the nation. Education was esteemed. The corrupt  lives of the priests were condemned and an effort was made to reform  life through the revival of a certain school of Confucian teachers  known as \"Shin-Gaku\"--\"Heart-Knowledge.\" Art also made progress, both  pictorial and manual. It would almost seem as if modern artificers and  painters had lost the skill of their forefathers of one or two hundred  years ago.    Many reasons explain the continuance of the old political and social  order: the lack of a foreign foe to compel abandonment of the tribal  organisation; the mountainous nature of the country with its slow,  primitive means of intercommunication; the absence of all idea of a  completely centralized nation. Furthermore, the principle of complete  subordination to superiors and ancestors had become so strong that  individual innovations were practically impossible. Japan thus lacked  the indispensable key to further progress, the principle of  individualism. The final step in the development of her nationality  has been taken, therefore, only in our own time.    Old Japan seemed absolutely committed to a thorough-going antagonism  to everything foreign. New Japan seems committed to the opposite  policy. What are the steps by which she has effected this apparent  national reversal of attitude?    We should first note that the absolutism of the Tokugawa Shogunate  served to arouse ever-growing opposition because of its stern  repression of individual opinion. It not only forbade the Christian  religion, but also all independent thought in religious philosophy and  in politics. The particular form of Confucian moral philosophy which  it held was forced on all public teachers of Confucianism. Dissent was  not only heretical, but treasonable. Although, by its military  absolutism, the Tokugawa rule secured the great blessing of peace,  lasting over two hundred years, and although the curse of Japan for  well-nigh a thousand preceding years had been fierce inter-tribal and  inter-family wars and feuds, yet it secured that peace at the expense  of individual liberty of thought and act. It thus gradually aroused  against itself the opposition of many able minds. The enforced peace  rendered it possible for these men to devote themselves to problems of  thought and of history. Indeed, they had no other outlet for their  energies. As they studied the history of the past and compared their  results with the facts of the present, it gradually dawned on the  minds of the scholars of the eighteenth century, that the Tokugawa  family were exercising functions of government which had never been  delegated to them; and that the Emperor was a poverty-stricken puppet  in the hands of a family that had seized the military power and had  gradually absorbed all the active functions of government, together  with its revenues.    It is possible for us to see now that these early Japanese scholars  idealized their ancient history, and assigned to the Emperor a place  in ancient times which in all probability he has seldom held. But,  however that may be, they thought their view correct, and held that  the Emperor was being deprived of his rightful rule by the Tokugawa  family.    These ideas, first formulated in secret by scholars, gradually  filtered down, still in secrecy, and were accepted by a large number  of the samurai, the military literati of the land. Their opposition to  the actual rulers of the land, aroused by the individual-crushing  absolutism of the Tokugawa rule, naturally allied itself to the  religious sentiment of loyalty to the Emperor. Few Westerners can  appreciate the full significance of this fact. Throughout the  centuries loyalty to the Emperor has been considered a cardinal  virtue. With one exception, according to the popular histories, no one  ever acknowledged himself opposed to the Emperor. Every rebellion  against the powers in actual possession made it the first aim to gain  possession of the Emperor, and proclaim itself as fighting for him.  When, therefore, the scholars announced that the"]]]
