'No wealth will stand such waste, your Majesty--        'He who thinks a minute little, like a fool misuses more;      He who counts a cowry nothing, being wealthy, will be poor.'    'A king's treasury, my liege, is the king's life.'    'Good brother,' observed Stiff-ears, who had heard what the Bull said,  'these Jackals are your Ministers of Home and Foreign Affairs--they  should not have direction of the Treasury. They are old servants, too,  and you know the saying--        'Brahmans, soldiers, these and kinsmen--of the three set none in              charge:      For the Brahman, tho' you rack him, yields no treasure small or large;      And the soldier, being trusted, writes his quittance with his sword,      And the kinsman cheats his kindred by the charter of the word;      But a servant old in service, worse than any one is thought,      Who, by long-tried license fearless, knows his master's anger nought.'    Ministers, my royal brother, are often like obstinate swellings that  want squeezing, and yours must be kept in order.'    'They are not particularly obedient, I confess,' said Tawny-hide.    'It is very wrong,' replied Stiff-ears; 'and if you will be advised by  me--as we have banqueted enough to-day--you will appoint this  grain-eating and sagacious Bull your Superintendent of Stores.'    'It shall be so,' exclaimed the King.    'Lusty-life was accordingly appointed to serve out the provisions, and  for many days Tawny-hide showed him favor beyond all others in the  Court.    \"Now the Jackals soon found that food was no longer so freely provided  by this arrangement as before, and they met to consult about it.    'It is all our own fault,' said Damanaka, 'and people must suffer for  their own mistakes. You know who said--        \"I that could not leave alone      'Streak-o'-Gold,' must therefore moan.      She that took the House-wife's place      Lost the nose from off her face.      Take this lesson to thy heart--      Fools for folly suffer smart.\"    'No!' said Karataka, 'how was it?' Damanaka related:--      THE STORY OF THE PRINCE AND THE PROCURESS    \"In the city of 'Golden-Streets' there reigned a valorous King, named  Vira-vikrama, whose officer of justice was one day taking away to  punishment a certain Barber, when he was stopped by a strolling  mendicant, who held him by the skirts, and cried out, 'Punish not this  man--punish them that do wrong of their own knowledge.' Being asked his  meaning, he recited the foregoing verses, and, being still further  questioned, he told this story--    \"I am Prince Kandarpa-ketu, son of the King of Ceylon. Walking one day  in my summer-garden, I heard a merchant-captain narrating how that out  at sea, deep under water, on the fourteenth day of the moon, he had seen  what was like nothing but the famous tree of Paradise, and sitting under  it a lady of most lustrous beauty, bedecked with strings of pearls like  Lukshmi herself, reclining, with a lute in her hands, on what appeared  to be a golden couch crusted all over with precious stones. At once I  engaged the captain and his ship, and steered to the spot of which he  told me. On reaching it I beheld the beautiful apparition as he had  described it, and, transported with the exquisite beauty of the lady, I  leapt after her into the sea. In a moment I found myself in a city of  gold; and in an apartment of a golden palace, surrounded by young and  beautiful girls, I found the Sea-queen. She perceived my approach, and  sent an attendant with a courteous message to meet me. In reply to my  questions, I learned that the lady was the Princess Ratnamanjari,  daughter of the King of All the Spirits--and how she had made a vow that  whoever should first come to see her golden city, with his own eyes,  should marry her. So I married her by the form called Gundharva, or  'Union by mutual consent,' and spent many and happy days in her  delightful society. One day she took me aside, and said, 'Dear Prince!  all these delights, and I myself, are thine to enjoy; only that picture  yonder, of the Fairy Streak-o'-Gold, that thou must never touch!' For a  long time I observed this injunction; at last, impelled by resistless  curiosity, I laid my hand on the picture of 'Streak-o'-Gold,' In one  instant her little foot, lovely as the lotus-blossom, advanced from out  of the painting, and launched me through sea and air into my own  country. Since that I have been a miserable wanderer; and passing  through this city, I chanced to lodge at a Cowkeeper's hut, and saw the  truth of this Barber's affair. The herdsman returned at night with his  cattle, and found his wife talking with the wife of the Barber, who is  no better than a bawd. Enraged at this, the man beat his wife, tied her  to the milking-post, and fell asleep. In the dead of the night the  Barber's wife came back, and said to the woman, 'He, whom thou knowest,  is burnt with the cruel fire of thine absence, and lies nigh to death;  go therefore and console him, and I will tie myself to the post until  thou returnest.' This was done, and the Cowkeeper presently awoke. 'Ah!  thou light thing!' he said jeeringly, 'why dost not thou keep promise,  and meet thy gallant?' The Barber's wife could make no reply; whereat  becoming incensed, the man cried out, 'What! dost thou scorn to speak to  me? I will cut thy nose off!' And so he did, and then lay down to sleep  again. Very soon the Cowkeeper's wife came back and asked if 'all was  well.' 'Look at my face!' said the Barber's wife, 'and you will see if  all is well.' The woman could do nothing but take her place again,  while the Barber's wife, picking up the severed nose, and at a sad loss  how to account for it, went to her house. In the morning, before it was  light, the Barber called to her to bring his box of razors, and she  bringing one only, he flung it away in a passion. 'Oh, the knave!' she  cried out, directly, aloud, 'Neighbors, neighbors! he has cut my nose  off!' and so she took him before the officers. The Cowkeeper, meantime,  wondering at his wife's patience, made some inquiry about her nose;  whereto she replied, 'Cruel wretch! thou canst not harm a virtuous  woman. If Yama and the seven guardians of the world know me chaste, then  be my face unmaimed!' The herdsman hastened to fetch a light, and  finding her features unaltered, he flung himself at her feet, and begged  forgiveness. For,        'Never tires the fire of burning, never wearies death of slaying,      Nor the sea of drinking rivers, nor the bright-eyed of betraying,'    Thereupon the King's officer dismissed Kandarpa-ketu, and did justice by  setting the Barber free, shaving the head of the Barber's wife, and  punishing the Cowkeeper's.    'That is my story,' concluded Damanaka, 'and thence I said that we had  no reason to complain.'    'Well, but we must do something,' said Karataka.    'Yes! How shall we break the friendship of the King with the Bull?'  asked the other.    'It is very strong,' observed Karataka.    'But we can do it,' replied the other.        'What force would fail to win, fraud can attain:--      The Crow despatched the Serpent by a chain.'    'How did that occur?' asked Karataka.    Damanaka related:--      THE STORY OF THE BLACK SNAKE AND THE GOLDEN CHAIN    \"A pair of Crows had their abode in a certain tree, the hollow of which  was occupied by a black snake, who had often devoured their young. The  Hen-bird, finding herself breeding again, thus addressed her mate:  'Husband, we must leave this tree; we shall never rear young ones while  this black snake lives here! You know the saw--        'From false friends that breed thee strife,      From a house with serpents rife,      Saucy slaves and brawling wife--      Get thee out, to save thy life.'    'My dear,' replied the Crow, 'you need not fear; I have put up with him  till I am tired. Now I will put an end to him.'    'How can you fight with a great black snake like that?' said the  Hen-bird.    'Doubt nothing,' answered the other--        'He that hath sense hath strength; the fool is weak:--      The Lion proud died by the Hare so meek,'    'How came that about?' asked the Hen-Crow.    'Thus,' replied her mate:--      THE STORY OF THE LION AND THE OLD HARE    \"On the Mandara mountain there lived a Lion named Fierce-of-heart, and  he was perpetually making massacre of all the wild animals. The thing  grew so bad that the beasts held a public meeting, and drew up a  respectful remonstrance to the Lion in these words:--    \"Wherefore should your Majesty thus make carnage of us all? If it may  please you, we ourselves will daily furnish a beast for your Majesty's  meal.\" The Lion responded, \"If that arrangement is more agreeable to  you, be it so.\"; and from that time a beast was allotted to him daily,  and daily devoured. One day it came to the turn of an old hare to supply  the royal table, who reflected to himself as he walked along, \"I can but  die, and I will go to my death leisurely.\"    \"Now Fierce-of-heart, the lion, was pinched with hunger, and seeing the  Hare so approaching he roared out, \"How darest thou thus delay in  coming?\"    'Sire,' replied the Hare, 'I am not to blame. I was detained on the road  by another lion, who exacted an oath from me to return when I should  have informed your Majesty.'    'Go,' exclaimed King Fierce-of-heart in a rage; 'show me, instantly,  where this insolent villain of a lion lives.'    \"The Hare led the way accordingly till he came to a deep well, whereat  he stopped, and said, 'Let my lord the King come hither and behold him.'  The Lion approached, and beheld his own reflection in the water of the  well, upon which, in his passion, he directly flung himself, and so  perished.\"    \"I have heard your story,\" said the Hen-Crow, \"but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"for me. I beg you will request the leader of the choir  (the devil alone knows what the office is!) to be so good as to give us  Carl's _certificate of birth_ on the afternoon of the same day if possible.  He might do so at seven o'clock in the morning, at the time we arrive; but  he ought to be punctual, for Carl is to appear at the examination at  half-past seven o'clock. So it must be _either to-morrow at_ seven, or _at  all events in the afternoon_. We shall call on you to-morrow before seven  o'clock to inquire about this, with the proviso of a visit later in the  day. In haste, and asking your pardon,    Your    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.      281.    PETITION TO THE MAGISTRACY.[1]    Oct. 30, 1819.    GENTLEMEN,--    My brother, Carl van Beethoven, died on November 5, 1815, leaving a boy  twelve years old,--his son Carl. In his will, by clause 5, he bequeathed to  me the guardianship of the boy, and in the codicil B he expressed a wish  that his widow, Johanna, should have a share in this duty, adding that, for  the sake of his child, he recommended her to submit to my guidance. This  explicit declaration of the father, added to my legal claim, I being the  nearest relative (clause 198), entitles me clearly to the guardianship of  my nephew, Carl van Beethoven; and the Court of Justice, by their Decree E,  committed to me, under existing circumstances, the guardianship, to the  exclusion moreover of Beethoven's widow. A journey on business having  compelled me to be for some time absent, I did not object to an official  guardian supplying my place for the time, which was effected by the  nomination of the Town Sequestrator, Herr Nussboeck.    Being now, however, finally settled here, and the welfare of the boy very  precious to me, both love and duty demand that I should resume my rights;  especially as this talented lad is coming to an age when greater care and  expense must be bestowed on his education, on which his whole future  prospects depend. This duty ought not to be confided to any woman, far less  to his mother, who possesses neither the will nor the power to adopt those  measures indispensable to a manly and suitable education.    I am the more anxious to reclaim my guardianship of Carl, as I understand  that, in consequence of want of means to defray the expenses of the school  where I placed him, he is to be removed, and his mother wishes him to live  with her, in order herself to spend his trifling provision, and thus save  the one half of her pension, which, according to the decree, she is bound  to apply to his use.    I have hitherto taken a paternal charge of my nephew, and I intend to do  the same in future at my own expense, being resolved that the hopes of his  deceased father, and the expectations I have formed for this clever boy,  shall be fulfilled by his becoming an able man and a good citizen.    With this view I accordingly request that the highly respected magistrates  whom I now address will be pleased to annul the Town Sequestrator  Nussboeck's interim office, and forthwith transfer to me the sole  guardianship of my nephew Carl van Beethoven.[2]    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Evidently drawn up by his advocate, Dr. Bach, from Beethoven's  notes.]    [Footnote 2: The magisterial decree of Nov. 4, 1819, was adverse to  Beethoven.]      282.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Vienna, Nov. 10, 1819.    DEAR RIES,--    I write to let you know that the Sonata is already out, though only a  fortnight ago, and it is nearly six months since I sent you both the  Quintet and the Sonata. In the course of a few days I will send them both  to you engraved, and from them you can correct the two works.    Having received no letter from you on the subject, I thought the thing was  at an end. I have indeed made shipwreck already with Neate this year! I  only wish you could contrive to get me the fifty ducats which I have yet to  receive, as I calculated on them, and really am in great want of money. I  shall say no more to-day, but must inform you that I have nearly completed  a _new Grand Mass_. Write to me whether you could do anything with this in  London; but soon, very soon, and send the money soon also for both works. I  will write more fully next time. In haste,    Your true and faithful friend,    BEETHOVEN.      283.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Dec. 14, 1819.    Immediately on last leaving Y.R.H. I was taken ill, of which I apprised  Y.R.H., but owing to a change in my household, neither the letter in  question nor another to Y.R.H. was ever sent. In it I begged Y.R.H.'s  indulgence, having some works on hand that I was obliged to dispatch with  all speed, owing to which I was, alas! compelled to lay aside the Mass  also.[1] I hope Y.R.H. will ascribe the delay solely to the pressure of  circumstances. This is not the time to enter fully into the subject, but I  must do so as soon as the right moment arrives, that Y.R.H. may not form  too severe or undeserved a judgment of me. My heart is always with Y.R.H.,  and I trust at length circumstances may in so far change, that I may be  able to contribute more than I have hitherto done, to perfecting your great  talent. I think, however, Y.R.H. is already aware of my good-will in this  respect, and is fully convinced that insurmountable obstacles alone can  ever detain me from the most excellent of all princes, so revered by me,  and so entwined with every feeling of my heart. I did not till yesterday  hear of the mistake about the two letters, and I now intend to bring them  myself, for I have no one in my service on whom I can depend. I will  present myself at your house this afternoon at half-past four o'clock. My  warmest thanks for Y.R.H.'s kind letter to me. When Y.R.H. thus vouchsafes  to declare your esteem for me, it only heightens and increases my impulse  to all that is good.    [Footnote 1: Another allusion to the Grand Mass in D, which seemed likely  never to be completed.]      284.    MEMORANDUM.    1822.    The Mass[1] will soon be all in Y.R.H.'s hands; it ought to have been, and  would have been so long ago, but--but--but--when Y.R.H. becomes acquainted  with my circumstances, you will be surprised that I have even now been able  to finish it.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The circumstances which prevented the completion of this work  were undoubtedly his perpetual state of strife with his nephew and his  sister-in-law.]      285.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    I heard with heartfelt sorrow of Y.R.H.'s indisposition, but hope soon to  hear of your recovery. Why am I also ill? for I might possibly discover the  best mode of restoring Y.R.H. I will call again to inquire after Y.R.H.,  and hope to hear good news.    [K.]      286.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    I have been rather an invalid all this time, though I try to think myself  tolerably well. I deeply regret to hear of Y.R.H.'s attack, especially as I  knew nothing of it, or I certainly should have hastened to inquire whether  it was in my power in any way to alleviate your sufferings. To-morrow, in  compliance with Y.R.H.'s wish, I shall certainly enjoy the pleasure of  seeing my own most dear and illustrious master.    [K.]      287.    TO THE ROYAL AND IMPERIAL HIGH COURT OF APPEAL.    Jan. 7, 1820.    GENTLEMEN,--    On the plea of the Decree A, I sought to have transferred to myself the  guardianship of my nephew, Carl v. Beethoven, but was referred by the  magistracy to the previous decision. On my consequent remonstrance the same  result ensued.    I find myself the more aggrieved by this, inasmuch as not only are my own  rights set at naught, but even the welfare of my nephew is thus utterly  disregarded. I am therefore compelled to have recourse to the highest Court  of Appeal to lay before them my well-founded claim, and rightfully to  demand that the guardianship of my nephew should be restored to me.    My reasons are the following:--    1st. I am entitled to the guardianship of my nephew, not only by his  father's will, but by law, and this the Court of Justice confirmed to the  exclusion of the mother. When business called me away from Vienna, I  conceded that Herr Nussboeck should act for me _ad interim_. Having now,  however, taken up my residence here, the welfare of my nephew demands that  I should again undertake the office of his guardian.    2d. My nephew has arrived at an age when he requires to be trained to a  higher degree of cultivation. Neither his mother nor his present guardian  are calculated to guide the boy in the pursuit of his studies. The former,  in the first place, because she is a woman; and as to her conduct, it has  been legally proved that, to say the least of it, she has no creditable  testimonials to bring forward,[1] on which account she was expressly  prohibited from acting by the Court of Justice. How the Honorable  Magistracy could nevertheless again appoint her is quite incomprehensible.  The latter is unfit; because, on the one hand, his office as sequestrator  and administrator of houses and lands, occupies his time too much to enable  him properly to undertake the duties of guardian to the boy; and, on the  other, because his previous occupation as a paper manufacturer, does not  inspire me with any confidence that he possesses the intelligence or  judgment indispensable to conduct a scientific education.    3d. The welfare of my nephew is dearer to my heart than it can be to any  one else. I am myself childless, and have no relations except this boy, who  is full of talent, and I have good grounds to hope the best for him, if  properly trained. Now I am compelled to hear that he has been delayed a  whole year by remaining in his previous class, from want of means to defray  the expense, and that his mother intends to remove him from his present  school, and wishes him to live with her. What a misfortune to the boy, were  he to become a victim to the mismanagement of his mother, who would fain  squander on herself that"]]]
