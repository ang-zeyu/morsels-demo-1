If the person at  whom it is aimed happens to be busy or already engaged in some definite  train of thought, the particles of his mental body are already swinging at  a certain determinate rate, and cannot for the moment be affected from  without. In that case the thought-form bides its time, hanging about its  object until he is sufficiently at rest to permit its entrance; then it  discharges itself upon him, and in the act ceases to exist.    The self-centred thought behaves in exactly the same way with regard to its  generator, and discharges itself upon him when opportunity offers. If it be  an evil thought, he generally regards it as the suggestion of a tempting  demon, whereas in truth he tempts himself. Usually each definite thought  creates a new thought-form; but if a thought-form of the same nature is  already hovering round the thinker, under certain circumstances a new  thought on the same subject, instead of creating a new form, coalesces with  and strengthens, the old one, so that by long brooding over the same  subject a man may sometimes create a thought-form of tremendous power. If  the thought be a wicked one, such a thought-form may become a veritable  evil influence, lasting perhaps for many years, and having for a time all  the appearance and powers of a real living entity.    All these which have been described are the ordinary unpremeditated  thoughts of man. A man can make a thought-form intentionally, and aim it at  another with the object of helping him. This is one of the lines of  activity adopted by those who desire to serve humanity. A steady stream of  powerful thought directed intelligently upon another person may be of the  greatest assistance to him. A strong thought-form may be a real guardian  angel, and protect its object from impurity, from irritability or from  fear.    An interesting branch of the subject is the study of the various shapes and  colours taken by thought-forms of different kinds. The colours indicate the  nature of the thought, and are in agreement with those which we have  already described as existing in the bodies. The shapes are of infinite  variety, but are often in some way typical of the kind of thought which  they express.    Every thought of definite character, such as a thought of affection or  hatred, of devotion or suspicion, of anger or fear, of pride or jealousy,  not only creates a form but also radiates an undulation. The fact that,  each one of these thoughts is expressed by a certain colour indicates that  the thought expresses itself as an oscillation of the matter of a certain  part of the mental body. This rate of oscillation communicates itself to  the surrounding mental matter precisely in the same way as the vibration of  a bell communicates itself to the surrounding air.    This radiation travels out in all directions, and whenever it impinges upon  another mental body in a passive or receptive condition it communicates to  it something of its own vibration. This does not convey a definite complete  idea, as does the thought-form, but it tends to produce a thought of the  same character as itself. For example, if the thought be devotional its  undulations will excite devotion, but the object of the worship may be  different in the case of each person upon whose mental body they impinge.  The thought-form, on the other hand, can reach only one person, but will  convey to that person (if receptive) not only a general devotional feeling,  but also a precise image of the Being for whom the adoration was originally  felt.    Any person who habitually thinks pure, good and strong thoughts is  utilizing for that purpose the higher part of his mental body--a part which  is not used at all by the ordinary man, and is entirely undeveloped in him.  Such an one is therefore a power for good in the world, and is being of  great use to all those of his neighbours who are capable of any sort of  response. For the vibration which he sends out tends to arouse a new and  higher part of their mental bodies, and consequently to open before them  altogether new fields of thought.    It may not be exactly the same thought as that sent out, but it is of the  same nature. The undulations generated by a man thinking of Theosophy do  not necessarily communicate Theosophical ideas to all those around him; but  they do awaken in them more liberal and higher thought than that to which  they have before been accustomed. On the other hand, the thought-forms  generated under such circumstances, though more limited in their action  than the radiation, are also more precise; they can affect only those who  are to some extent open to them, but to them they will convey definite  Theosophical ideas.    The colours of the astral body bear the same meaning as those of the higher  vehicles, but are several octaves of colours below them, and much more  nearly approaching to such hues as we see in the physical world. It is the  vehicle of passion and emotion, and consequently it may exhibit additional  colours, expressing man's less desirable feelings, which cannot show  themselves at higher levels; for example, a lurid brownish-red indicates  the presence of sensuality, while black clouds show malice and hatred. A  curious livid grey betokens the presence of fear, and a much darker grey,  usually arranged in heavy rings around the ovoid, indicates a condition of  depression. Irritability is shown by the presence of a number of small  scarlet flecks in the astral body, each representing a small angry impulse.  Jealousy is shown by a peculiar brownish-green, generally studded with the  same scarlet flecks. The astral body is in size and shape like those just  described, and in the ordinary man its outline is usually clearly marked;  but in the case of primitive man it is often exceedingly irregular, and  resembles a rolling cloud composed of all the more unpleasant colours.    When the astral body is comparatively quiet (it is never actually at rest)  the colours which are to be seen in it indicate those emotions to which the  man is most in the habit of yielding himself. When the man experiences a  rush of any particular feeling, the rate of vibration which expresses that  feeling dominates for a time the entire astral body. If, for example, it be  devotion, the whole of his astral body is flushed with, blue, and while the  emotion remains at its strongest the normal colours do little more than  modify the blue, or appear faintly through a veil of it; but presently the  vehemence of the sentiment dies away, and the normal colours re-assert  themselves. But because of that spasm of emotion the part of the astral  body which is normally blue has been increased in size. Thus a man who  frequently feels high devotion soon comes to have a large area of the blue  permanently existing in his astral body.    When the rush of devotional _feeling_ comes over him, it is usually  accompanied by _thoughts_ of devotion. Although primarily formed in the  mental body, these draw round themselves a large amount of astral matter as  well, so that their action is in both worlds. In both worlds also is the  radiation which was previously described, so that the devotional man is a  centre of devotion, and will influence other people to share both his  thoughts and his feelings. The same is true in the case of affection,  anger, depression--and, indeed, of all other feelings.    The flood of emotion does not itself greatly affect the mental body,  although for a time it may render it almost impossible for any activity  from that mental body to come through into the physical brain. That is not  because that body itself is affected, but because the astral body, which  acts as a bridge between it and the physical brain, is vibrating so  entirely at one rate as to be incapable of conveying any undulation which  is not in harmony with that.    The permanent colours of the astral body react upon, the mental. They  produce in it their correspondences, several octaves higher, in the same  manner as a musical note produces overtones. The mental body in its turn  reacts upon the causal in the same way, and thus all the good qualities  expressed in the lower vehicles by degrees establish themselves permanently  in the ego. The evil qualities cannot do so, as the rates of vibrations  which express them are impossible for the higher mental matter of which the  causal body is constructed.    So far, we have described vehicles which are the expression of the ego in  their respective worlds--vehicles, which he provides for himself; in the  physical world we come to a vehicle which is provided for him by Nature  under laws which will be later explained--which though also in some sense  an expression of him, is by no means a perfect manifestation. In ordinary  life we see only a small part of this physical body--only that which is  built of the solid and liquid subdivisions of physical matter. The body  contains matter of all the seven subdivisions, and all of them play their  part in its life and are of equal importance, to it.    We usually speak of the invisible part of the physical body as the etheric  double; \"double\" because it exactly reproduces the size and shape of the  part of the body that we can see, and \"etheric\" because it is built--of  that finer kind of matter by the vibrations of which light is conveyed to  the retina of the eye. (This must not be confused with the true aether of  space--that of which matter is the negation.) This invisible part of the  physical body is of great importance to us, since it is the vehicle through  which flow the streams of vitality which keep the body alive, and without  it, as a bridge to convey undulations of thought and feeling from the  astral to the visible denser physical matter, the ego could make no use of  the cells of his brain.

Thin  blue smoke ascends from rents and cracks, the breadth of the widest  measuring about a yard. Red heat appears at the depth of about four  fathoms. No marks of any extensive change appear on the surface, near  these burning fissures, although the growth of large trees in old cracks  on the opposite slope, where ignition has ceased, shows that this fire  has continued for a very considerable time, or that the same thing had  occurred at a much earlier period. In the form of the adjacent hills I  observed nothing peculiar, unless it be a contraction not very common of  the lower parts of ravines. The geological structure is, as might be  expected, more remarkable. Other summits of the range are porphyritic,**  but the hills of Wingen present a variety of rocks, within a small space.  In the adjacent gullies to the south of the hill, we find clay of a grey  mottled appearance, and shale containing apparently a small quantity of  decomposed vegetable matter; and near the fissure then on fire, occurred  a coarse sandstone with an argillaceous basis. To the north-west, in a  hollow containing water which drains from beneath the part ignited, is a  coarse sandstone, in some places highly charged with decomposed felspar,  and containing impressions of spirifers. The hill nearest to the part on  fire, on the south-west (b) consists of basalt with grains apparently of  olivine; and on a still higher hill, on the east (a) I found ironstone. A  small hill (c) connecting these two, and nearest to the part actually  burning, appears to consist of trap-rock, and is thickly strewed with  agates. The hills on the opposite or south side of the valley are  composed of compact felspar, with acicular crystals of glassy or common  felspar and grains of hornblende, crevices of the stone being coated with  films of serpentine or green earth.    (*Footnote. Volume 4 part 1 Second Series Geological Transactions,  Professor Buckland and Mr. De la Beche on the Geology of the  neighbourhood of Weymouth.)    (**Footnote. The porphyry of a hill three miles south of Wingen, consists  of a base of reddish-brown compact felspar, with embedded crystals of  common felspar and disseminated carbonate of lime.)    APPROACH LIVERPOOL RANGE.    December 3.    The party in proceeding crossed several deep gullies in the neighbourhood  of the burning hill; and the road continued to be well marked. At length  we began to ascend the chain of hills, which connects Wingen with Mount  Murulla and the Liverpool range. On gaining the summit of this range we  overlooked Wingen, whose situation was faintly discernible by the light  blue smoke. Three years had elapsed since my first visit to these  slumbering fires. The ridge we were crossing was strewed with fallen  trees; and broken branches with the leaves still upon them marked the  effects of some violent and recent storm. We descended to a beautiful  valley of considerable extent, watered by Page's river, which rises in  the main range. We reached the banks of this stream at four P.M. and  encamped on a fine flat. The extremities from the mountains on the north  descend in long and gradual slopes, and are well covered with grass. This  was already eaten short by sheep. Two babbling brooks water the flat at  the part where we pitched our tents, and which is opposite to Whalan's  station; one of these being the river Page, or Macqueen's River; the  other known only as The Creek. The space between them is flat, and  apparently consists of a soil of excellent quality. The heat of the day  was excessive, the thermometer 80 degrees at sunset.    MOUNT MURULLA.    December 4.    Mount Murulla is a remarkable cone of the Liverpool range, and being  visible from Warrawolong, is consequently an important point in the  general survey of the colony.    From Murulla, the range we had crossed extends eastward, enclosing the  valley in which we were encamped, and which gives birth to the river  Page. Our way now lay westward, towards the head of this valley, in order  to cross by the usual route, the higher and principal range, which still  lay to the north. We traversed, this day, six miles of the valley, and  encamped beside a remarkable rock, near to which the track turned  northward. I rode a little beyond our bivouac, and chanced to fall in  with a tribe of natives from Pewen Bewen on Dart Brook, one of whom  afterwards visited our camp, but he could tell us little about the  interior country. The whole of the valley appears to consist of good  land, and the adjacent mountains afford excellent sheep pasture. In the  evening, a native of Liverpool plains came to our tents; I gave him a  tobacco-pipe, and he promised to show me the best road across them.  Thermometer at sunset 84 degrees.    CROSS LIVERPOOL RANGE.    December 5.    This morning we ascended Liverpool range, which divides the colony from  the unexplored country. Having heard much of this difficult pass, we  proceeded cautiously, by attaching thirteen bullocks to each cart, and  ascending with one at a time. The pass is a low neck, named by the  natives Hecknaduey, but we left the beaten track (which was so very steep  that it was usual to unload carts in order to pass) and took a new route,  which afforded an easier ascent. All had got up safely, and were  proceeding along a level portion, on the opposite side of the range, when  the axle of one of the carts broke, and it became necessary to leave it,  and place the load on the spare packhorses, and such of the bullocks,  taken out of the shafts, as had been broken in to carry packsaddles.    A SICK TRIBE.    We reached at length, a watercourse called Currungai, and encamped upon  its bank, beside the natives from Dart Brook, who had crossed the range  before us, apparently to join some of their tribe, who lay at this place  extremely ill, being affected with a virulent kind of smallpox. We found  the helpless creatures, stretched on their backs, beside the water, under  the shade of the wattle or mimosa trees, to avoid the intense heat of the  sun. We gave them from our stock some medicine; and the wretched  sufferers seemed to place the utmost confidence in its efficacy. I had  often indeed occasion to observe, that however obtuse in some things, the  aborigines seemed to entertain a sort of superstitious belief, in the  virtues of all kinds of physic. I found that this distressed tribe were  also strangers in the land, to which they had resorted. Their meekness,  as aliens, and their utter ignorance of the country they were in, were  very unusual in natives, and excited our sympathy, especially when their  demeanour was contrasted with the prouder bearing and intelligence of the  native of the plains, who had undertaken to be my guide.    INTERIOR WATERS.    Here I at length drank the water of a stream, which flowed into the  unexplored interior; and from a hill near our route I beheld, this day,  for the first time, a distant blue horizon, exactly resembling that of  the ocean.    December 6.    LIVERPOOL PLAINS.    At an early hour we continued the journey towards the plains, guided by  the natives, and along a cart track, which led towards some cattle  stations. We crossed a low ridge of rich earth, in which were embedded  nodules of limestone, and fragments of trap-rock. After passing several  extremities of ridges, of a similar description, all being branches from  high ranges on our left, we came upon a portion of the plains. This  expanse of open level country, extended in a northerly direction, as far  as human vision could reach; and being clear of trees, presented a  remarkable contrast to the settled districts of the colony. The soil of  these plains looked rich, the grass was good, and herds of cattle  browsing at a distance, added pastoral beauty, to that which had been  recently a desert.    PROPOSED ROUTE.    We now turned from the track, we had thus far followed in a  west-south-west direction, and parting from our friends, the natives, who  insisted on our keeping the track, we again entered the woods, by turning  a little to the north. My object, in proceeding in this direction, was to  reach the bank of Peel's river at Wallawoul; that stream having been laid  down as holding a northerly course, and consequently I had reason to  believe that it would lead to any greater river flowing to the  north-west, as reported by The Barber. But independently of this  consideration, it was expedient to travel along its right bank, which  commanded access to the high ranges on the east, and would therefore  secure the party from any danger of obstruction from floods. I soon came  on another path, and a line of marked trees, which a native, whom I met,  said was the road from Palmer's to Loder's station. We next arrived at a  deep dry bed, which in wet seasons must be filled by a very considerable  stream, but in that time of drought, it was not until after riding up and  down a considerable distance in search of water, that I at length found  some ponds. The native name of this channel is Nuzabella. We crossed its  bed, in order to encamp at a shady spot, where the long grass had been  burnt a short while before. In other parts the grass reached to the heads  of the horses, and at this time was so liable to catch fire, and was so  frequently set on fire by the natives, that with our stock of ammunition,  the situation of the camp required particular attention. The bullocks  were much fatigued with this day's journey, the thermometer having stood  at 96 degrees in the shade, and at sunset, and even during part of the  night, it was as high as 90 degrees.    HORSES ASTRAY.    At twilight, on enquiring, as usual, if the horses had been tethered and  spancelled, I was informed that seven had"]]]
