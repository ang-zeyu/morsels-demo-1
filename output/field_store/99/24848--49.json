[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#9)"],[1," this expedition,\" answered the Knight,  \"and honoured in the service; but not born his subject, although a  native of the island in which he reigns.\"    \"How mean you? \" said the Eastern soldier; \"have you then two kings in  one poor island?\"    \"As thou sayest,\" said the Scot, for such was Sir Kenneth by birth. \"It  is even so; and yet, although the inhabitants of the two extremities of  that island are engaged in frequent war, the country can, as thou seest,  furnish forth such a body of men-at-arms as may go far to shake the  unholy hold which your master hath laid on the cities of Zion.\"    \"By the beard of Saladin, Nazarene, but that it is a thoughtless and  boyish folly, I could laugh at the simplicity of your great Sultan, who  comes hither to make conquests of deserts and rocks, and dispute the  possession of them with those who have tenfold numbers at command, while  he leaves a part of his narrow islet, in which he was born a sovereign,  to the dominion of another sceptre than his. Surely, Sir Kenneth, you  and the other good men of your country should have submitted yourselves  to the dominion of this King Richard ere you left your native land,  divided against itself, to set forth on this expedition?\"    Hasty and fierce was Kenneth's answer. \"No, by the bright light of  Heaven! If the King of England had not set forth to the Crusade till  he was sovereign of Scotland, the Crescent might, for me, and all  true-hearted Scots, glimmer for ever on the walls of Zion.\"    Thus far he had proceeded, when, suddenly recollecting himself, he  muttered, \"MEA CULPA! MEA CULPA! what have I, a soldier of the Cross, to  do with recollection of war betwixt Christian nations!\"    The rapid expression of feeling corrected by the dictates of duty did  not escape the Moslem, who, if he did not entirely understand all  which it conveyed, saw enough to convince him with the assurance that  Christians, as well as Moslemah, had private feelings of personal pique,  and national quarrels, which were not entirely reconcilable. But the  Saracens were a race, polished, perhaps, to the utmost extent which  their religion permitted, and particularly capable of entertaining high  ideas of courtesy and politeness; and such sentiments prevented his  taking any notice of the inconsistency of Sir Kenneth's feelings in the  opposite characters of a Scot and a Crusader.    Meanwhile, as they advanced, the scene began to change around them. They  were now turning to the eastward, and had reached the range of steep and  barren hills which binds in that quarter the naked plain, and varies the  surface of the country, without changing its sterile character. Sharp,  rocky eminences began to rise around them, and, in a short time, deep  declivities and ascents, both formidable in height and difficult from  the narrowness of the path, offered to the travellers obstacles of a  different kind from those with which they had recently contended.    Dark caverns and chasms amongst the rocks--those grottoes so often  alluded to in Scripture--yawned fearfully on either side as they  proceeded, and the Scottish knight was informed by the Emir that these  were often the refuge of beasts of prey, or of men still more ferocious,  who, driven to desperation by the constant war, and the oppression  exercised by the soldiery, as well of the Cross as of the Crescent, had  become robbers, and spared neither rank nor religion, neither sex nor  age, in their depredations.    The Scottish knight listened with indifference to the accounts of  ravages committed by wild beasts or wicked men, secure as he felt  himself in his own valour and personal strength; but he was struck  with mysterious dread when he recollected that he was now in the awful  wilderness of the forty days' fast, and the scene of the actual personal  temptation, wherewith the Evil Principle was permitted to assail the Son  of Man. He withdrew his attention gradually from the light and worldly  conversation of the infidel warrior beside him, and, however acceptable  his gay and gallant bravery would have rendered him as a companion  elsewhere, Sir Kenneth felt as if, in those wildernesses the waste and  dry places in which the foul spirits were wont to wander when expelled  the mortals whose forms they possessed, a bare-footed friar would have  been a better associate than the gay but unbelieving paynim.    These feelings embarrassed him the rather that the Saracen's spirits  appeared to rise with the journey, and because the farther he penetrated  into the gloomy recesses of the mountains, the lighter became his  conversation, and when he found that unanswered, the louder grew his  song. Sir Kenneth knew enough of the Eastern languages to be assured  that he chanted sonnets of love, containing all the glowing praises  of beauty in which the Oriental poets are so fond of luxuriating, and  which, therefore, were peculiarly unfitted for a serious or devotional  strain of thought, the feeling best becoming the Wilderness of the  Temptation. With inconsistency enough, the Saracen also sung lays in  praise of wine, the liquid ruby of the Persian poets; and his gaiety at  length became so unsuitable to the Christian knight's contrary train of  sentiments, as, but for the promise of amity which they had exchanged,  would most likely have made Sir Kenneth take measures to change his  note. As it was, the Crusader felt as if he had by his side some gay,  licentious fiend, who endeavoured to ensnare his soul, and endanger his  immortal salvation, by inspiring loose thoughts of earthly pleasure, and  thus polluting his devotion, at a time when his faith as a Christian and  his vow as a pilgrim called on him for a serious and penitential state  of mind. He was thus greatly perplexed, and undecided how to act; and it  was in a tone of hasty displeasure that, at length breaking silence, he  interrupted the lay of the celebrated Rudpiki, in which he prefers the  mole on his mistress's bosom to all the wealth of Bokhara and Samarcand.    \"Saracen,\" said the Crusader sternly, \"blinded as thou art, and plunged  amidst the errors of a false law, thou shouldst yet comprehend that  there are some places more holy than others, and that there are some  scenes also in which the Evil One hath more than ordinary power  over sinful mortals. I will not tell thee for what awful reason this  place--these rocks--these caverns with their gloomy arches, leading as  it were to the central abyss--are held an especial haunt of Satan and  his angels. It is enough that I have been long warned to beware of this  place by wise and holy men, to whom the qualities of the unholy region  are well known. Wherefore, Saracen, forbear thy foolish and  ill-timed levity, and turn thy thoughts to things more suited to the  spot--although, alas for thee! thy best prayers are but as blasphemy and  sin.\"    The Saracen listened with some surprise, and then replied, with  good-humour and gaiety, only so far repressed as courtesy required,  \"Good Sir Kenneth, methinks you deal unequally by your companion, or  else ceremony is but indifferently taught amongst your Western tribes.  I took no offence when I saw you gorge hog's flesh and drink wine, and  permitted you to enjoy a treat which you called your Christian liberty,  only pitying in my heart your foul pastimes. Wherefore, then, shouldst  thou take scandal, because I cheer, to the best of my power, a gloomy  road with a cheerful verse? What saith the poet, 'Song is like the  dews of heaven on the bosom of the desert; it cools the path of the  traveller.'\"    \"Friend Saracen,\" said the Christian, \"I blame not the love of  minstrelsy and of the GAI SCIENCE; albeit, we yield unto it even too  much room in our thoughts when they should be bent on better things.  But prayers and holy psalms are better fitting than LAIS of love, or of  wine-cups, when men walk in this Valley of the Shadow of Death, full of  fiends and demons, whom the prayers of holy men have driven forth  from the haunts of humanity to wander amidst scenes as accursed as  themselves.\"    \"Speak not thus of the Genii, Christian,\" answered the Saracen, \"for  know thou speakest to one whose line and nation drew their origin from  the immortal race which your sect fear and blaspheme.\"    \"I well thought,\" answered the Crusader, \"that your blinded race had  their descent from the foul fiend, without whose aid you would never  have been able to maintain this blessed land of Palestine against so  many valiant soldiers of God. I speak not thus of thee in particular,  Saracen, but generally of thy people and religion. Strange is it to me,  however, not that you should have the descent from the Evil One, but  that you should boast of it.\"    \"From whom should the bravest boast of descending, saving from him that  is bravest?\" said the Saracen; \"from whom should the proudest trace  their line so well as from the Dark Spirit, which would rather fall  headlong by force than bend the knee by his will? Eblis may be hated,  stranger, but he must be feared; and such as Eblis are his descendants  of Kurdistan.\"    Tales of magic and of necromancy were the learning of the period, and  Sir Kenneth heard his companion's confession of diabolical descent  without any disbelief, and without much wonder; yet not without a secret  shudder at finding himself in this fearful place, in the company of  one who avouched himself to belong to such a lineage. Naturally  insusceptible, however, of fear, he crossed himself, and stoutly  demanded of the Saracen an account of the pedigree which he had boasted.  The latter readily complied.    \"Know, brave stranger,\" he said, \"that when the cruel Zohauk, one of the  descendants of Giamschid, held the throne of Persia, he formed a league  with the Powers of Darkness, amidst the secret vaults of Istakhar,  vaults which the hands of the elementary spirits had hewn out of the  living rock long before Adam himself had an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#9)"],[1," that  broken peas were not removed before packing.
