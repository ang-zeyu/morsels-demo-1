[Sidenote: _Three persons of pronouns._]    76. Pronouns naturally are of three persons:--    (1) First person, representing the person speaking.    (2) Second person, representing a person or thing spoken to.    (3) Third person, standing for a person or thing spoken of.        FORMS OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.    77. Personal pronouns are inflected thus:--                              FIRST PERSON.                            _Singular._  _Nom._                         I  _Poss._                    mine, my  _Obj._                         me                               _Plural._  _Nom._                        we  _Poss._                    our, ours  _Obj._                        us                               SECOND PERSON.                            _Singular._                     _Old Form_   _Common Form._  _Nom._              thou               you  _Poss._          thine, thy        your, yours  _Obj._              thee               you                              _Plural._  _Nom._              ye                 you  _Poss._          your, yours        your, yours  _Obj._              you                you                             THIRD PERSON.                             _Singular._                     _Masc._   _Fem._   _Neut._.  _Nom._            he          she       it  _Poss._           his      her, hers    its  _Obj._            him         her       it                          _Plur. of all Three_.  _Nom._                       they  _Poss._                 their, theirs  _Obj._                       them      Remarks on These Forms.      [Sidenote: _First and second persons without gender._]    78. It will be noticed that the pronouns of the first and second  persons have no forms to distinguish gender. The speaker may be either  male or female, or, by personification, neuter; so also with the  person or thing spoken to.    [Sidenote: _Third person_ singular _has gender_.]    But the third person has, in the singular, a separate form for each  gender, and also for the neuter.    [Sidenote: _Old forms_.]    In Old English these three were formed from the same root; namely,  masculine _he_, feminine _heo_, neuter _hit_.    The form _hit_ (for _it_) is still heard in vulgar English, and _hoo_  (for _heo_) in some dialects of England.    The plurals were _hi_, _heora_, _heom_, in Old English; the forms  _they_, _their_, _them_, perhaps being from the English demonstrative,  though influenced by the cognate Norse forms.      [Sidenote: _Second person always plural in ordinary English._]    79. _Thou_, _thee_, etc., are old forms which are now out of use in  ordinary speech. The consequence is, that we have no singular pronoun  of the second person in ordinary speech or prose, but make the plural  _you_ do duty for the singular. We use it with a plural verb always,  even when referring to a single object.    [Sidenote: _Two uses of the old singulars._]      80. There are, however, two modern uses of _thou, thy_, etc.:--    (1) _In elevated style_, especially in poetry; as,--            With _thy_ clear keen joyance            Languor cannot be;          Shadow of annoyance            Never came near _thee_;       _Thou_ lovest; but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.--SHELLEY.    (2) _In addressing the Deity_, as in prayers, etc.; for example,--         Oh, _thou_ Shepherd of Israel, that didst comfort _thy_ people of       old, to _thy_ care we commit the helpless.--BEECHER.      [Sidenote: _The form_ its.]    81. It is worth while to consider the possessive _its_. This is of  comparatively recent growth. The old form was _his_ (from the  nominative _hit_), and this continued in use till the sixteenth  century. The transition from the old _his_ to the modern _its_ is  shown in these sentences:--         1 He anointed the altar and all _his_ vessels.--_Bible_    Here _his_ refers to _altar_, which is a neuter noun. The quotation  represents the usage of the early sixteenth century.         2 It's had _it_ head bit off by _it_ young--SHAKESPEARE    Shakespeare uses _his_, _it_, and sometimes _its_, as possessive of  _it_.    In Milton's poetry (seventeenth century) _its_ occurs only three  times.         3 See heaven _its_ sparkling portals wide display--POPE      [Sidenote: _A relic of the olden time._]    82. We have an interesting relic in such sentences as this from  Thackeray: \"One of the ways to know '_em_ is to watch the scared looks  of the ogres' wives and children.\"    As shown above, the Old English objective was _hem_ (or _heom_), which  was often sounded with the _h_ silent, just as we now say, \"I saw  '_im_ yesterday\" when the word _him_ is not emphatic. In spoken  English, this form '_em_ has survived side by side with the literary  _them_.      [Sidenote: _Use of the pronouns in personification._]    83. The pronouns _he_ and _she_ are often used in poetry, and  sometimes in ordinary speech, to personify objects (Sec. 34).        CASES OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.      I The Nominative.      [Sidenote: _Nominative forms._]    84. The nominative forms of personal pronouns have the same uses as  the nominative of nouns (see Sec. 58). The case of most of these  pronouns can be determined more easily than the case of nouns, for,  besides a nominative _use_, they have a nominative form. The words  _I_, _thou_, _he_, _she_, _we_, _ye_, _they_, are very rarely anything  but nominative in literary English, though _ye_ is occasionally used  as objective.      [Sidenote: _Additional nominatives in spoken English._]    85. In spoken English, however, there are some others that are added  to the list of nominatives: they are, _me_, _him_, _her_, _us_,  _them_, when they occur in the _predicate position_. That is, in such  a sentence as, \"I am sure it was _him_,\" the literary language would  require _he_ after _was_; but colloquial English regularly uses as  predicate nominatives the forms _me_, _him_, _her_, _us_, _them_,  though those named in Sec. 84 are always subjects. Yet careful  speakers avoid this, and follow the usage of literary English.      II. The Possessive.      [Sidenote: _Not a separate class._]    86. The forms _my_, _thy_, _his_, _her_, _its_, _our_, _your_,  _their_, are sometimes grouped separately as POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS, but  it is better to speak of them as the possessive case of personal  pronouns, just as we speak of the possessive case of nouns, and not  make more classes.    [Sidenote: Absolute _personal pronouns._]    The forms _mine_, _thine_, _yours_, _hers_, _theirs_, sometimes _his_  and _its_, have a peculiar use, standing apart from the words they  modify instead of immediately before them. From this use they are  called ABSOLUTE PERSONAL PRONOUNS, or, some say, ABSOLUTE POSSESSIVES.    As instances of the use of absolute pronouns, note the following:--         'Twas _mine_, 'tis _his_, and has been slave to thousands.       --SHAKESPEARE.         And since thou own'st that praise, I spare thee _mine_.--COWPER.         My arm better than _theirs_ can ward it off.--LANDOR.         _Thine_ are the city and the people of Granada.--BULWER.    [Sidenote: _Old use of_ mine _and_ thine.]    Formerly _mine_ and _thine_ stood before their nouns, if the nouns  began with a vowel or _h_ silent; thus,--         Shall I not take _mine_ ease in _mine_ inn?--SHAKESPEARE.         Give every man _thine_ ear, but few thy voice.--_Id._         If _thine_ eye offend thee, pluck it out.--_Bible._         My greatest apprehension was for _mine_ eyes.--SWIFT.    This usage is still preserved in poetry.      [Sidenote: _Double and triple possessives._]    87. The forms _hers_, _ours_, _yours_, _theirs_, are really double  possessives, since they add the possessive _s_ to what is already a  regular possessive inflection.    Besides this, we have, as in nouns, a possessive phrase made up of the  preposition _of_ with these double possessives, _hers_, _ours_,  _yours_, _theirs_, and with _mine_, _thine_, _his_, sometimes _its_.    [Sidenote: _Their uses._]    Like the noun possessives, they have several uses:--    (1) _To prevent ambiguity_, as in the following:--         I have often contrasted the habitual qualities of that gloomy       friend _of theirs_ with the astounding spirits of Thackeray and       Dickens.--J.T. FIELDS.         No words _of ours_ can describe the fury of the conflict.--J.F.       COOPER.    (2) _To bring emphasis_, as in these sentences:--         This thing _of yours_ that you call a Pardon of Sins, it is a bit       of rag-paper with ink.--CARLYLE.         This ancient silver bowl _of mine_, it tells of good old times.       --HOLMES.    (3) _To express contempt, anger, or satire_; for example,--         \"Do you know the charges that unhappy sister _of mine_ and her       family have put me to already?\" says the Master.--THACKERAY.         He [John Knox] had his pipe of Bordeaux too, we find, in that old       Edinburgh house _of his_.--CARLYLE.         \"Hold thy peace, Long Allen,\" said Henry Woodstall, \"I tell thee       that tongue _of thine_ is not the shortest limb about       _thee_.\"--SCOTT.    (4) _To make a noun less limited in application_; thus,--         A favorite liar and servant _of mine_ was a man I once had to       drive a brougham.--THACKERAY.         In New York I read a newspaper criticism one day, commenting upon       a letter _of mine_.--_Id._    What would the last two sentences mean if the word _my_ were written  instead of _of mine_, and preceded the nouns?      [Sidenote: _About the case of absolute pronouns._]    88. In their function, or use in a sentence, the absolute possessive  forms of the personal pronouns are very much like adjectives used as  nouns.    In such sentences as, \"_The good_ alone are great,\" \"None but _the  brave_ deserves _the fair_,\" the words italicized have an adjective  force and also a noun force, as shown in Sec. 20.    So in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#9)"],[1,", than he had fitted and shot another bolt.  Instantly the pigs were in turmoil, not knowing from whence the  danger threatened. They stood stupidly at first and then commenced  milling around until six of their number lay dead or dying about  them; then with a chorus of grunts and squeals they started off at  a wild run, disappearing quickly in the dense underbrush.    Tarzan then descended from the tree, dispatched those that were not  already dead and proceeded to skin the carcasses.  As he worked,  rapidly and with great skill, he neither hummed nor whistled as  does the average man of civilization. It was in numerous little  ways such as these that he differed from other men, due, probably,  to his early jungle training. The beasts of the jungle that he had  been reared among were playful to maturity but seldom thereafter.  His fellow-apes, especially the bulls, became fierce and surly as  they grew older. Life was a serious matter during lean seasons--one  had to fight to secure one's share of food then, and the habit once  formed became lifelong. Hunting for food was the life labor of the  jungle bred, and a life labor is a thing not to be approached with  levity nor prosecuted lightly. So all work found Tarzan serious,  though he still retained what the other beasts lost as they grew  older--a sense of humor, which he gave play to when the mood suited  him. It was a grim humor and sometimes ghastly; but it satisfied  Tarzan.    Then, too, were one to sing and whistle while working on the ground,  concentration would be impossible. Tarzan possessed the ability to  concentrate each of his five senses upon its particular business.  Now he worked at skinning the six pigs and his eyes and his fingers  worked as though there was naught else in all the world than these  six carcasses; but his ears and his nose were as busily engaged  elsewhere--the former ranging the forest all about and the latter  assaying each passing zephyr. It was his nose that first discovered  the approach of Sabor, the lioness, when the wind shifted for a  moment.    As clearly as though he had seen her with his eyes, Tarzan knew  that the lioness had caught the scent of the freshly killed pigs  and immediately had moved down wind in their direction. He knew  from the strength of the scent spoor and the rate of the wind about  how far away she was and that she was approaching from behind him.  He was finishing the last pig and he did not hurry. The five pelts  lay close at hand--he had been careful to keep them thus together  and near him--an ample tree waved its low branches above him.    He did not even turn his head for he knew she was not yet in sight;  but he bent his ears just a bit more sharply for the first sound  of her nearer approach. When the final skin had been removed he  rose. Now he heard Sabor in the bushes to his rear, but not yet  too close. Leisurely he gathered up the six pelts and one of the  carcasses, and as the lioness appeared between the boles of two  trees he swung upward into the branches above him. Here he hung  the hides over a limb, seated himself comfortably upon another with  his back against the bole of the tree, cut a hind quarter from  the carcass he had carried with him and proceeded to satisfy his  hunger. Sabor slunk, growling, from the brush, cast a wary eye  upward toward the ape-man and then fell upon the nearest carcass.    Tarzan looked down upon her and grinned, recalling an argument he  had once had with a famous big-game hunter who had declared that  the king of beasts ate only what he himself had killed. Tarzan knew  better for he had seen Numa and Sabor stoop even to carrion.    Having filled his belly, the ape-man fell to work upon the hides--all  large and strong. First he cut strips from them about half an inch  wide. When he had sufficient number of these strips he sewed two of  the hides together, afterwards piercing holes every three or four  inches around the edges.  Running another strip through these  holes gave him a large bag with a drawstring. In similar fashion he  produced four other like bags, but smaller, from the four remaining  hides and had several strips left over.    All this done he threw a large, juicy fruit at Sabor, cached the  remainder of the pig in a crotch of the tree and swung off toward  the southwest through the middle terraces of the forest, carrying  his five bags with him. Straight he went to the rim of the gulch  where he had imprisoned Numa, the lion.  Very stealthily he approached  the edge and peered over.  Numa was not in sight. Tarzan sniffed  and listened. He could hear nothing, yet he knew that Numa must be  within the cave.  He hoped that he slept--much depended upon Numa  not discovering him.    Cautiously he lowered himself over the edge of the cliff, and with  utter noiselessness commenced the descent toward the bottom of the  gulch. He stopped often and turned his keen eyes and ears in the  direction of the cave's mouth at the far end of the gulch, some  hundred feet away. As he neared the foot of the cliff his danger  increased greatly. If he could reach the bottom and cover half  the distance to the tree that stood in the center of the gulch he  would feel comparatively safe for then, even if Numa appeared, he  felt that he could beat him either to the cliff or to the tree,  but to scale the first thirty feet of the cliff rapidly enough to  elude the leaping beast would require a running start of at least  twenty feet as there were no very good hand- or footholds close  to the bottom--he had had to run up the first twenty feet like  a squirrel running up a tree that other time he had beaten an  infuriated Numa to it. He had no desire to attempt it again unless  the conditions were equally favorable at least, for he had escaped  Numa's raking talons by only a matter of inches on the former  occasion.    At last he stood upon the floor of the gulch. Silent as a disembodied  spirit he advanced toward the tree. He was half way there and no  sign of Numa. He reached the scarred bole from which the famished  lion had devoured the bark and even torn pieces of the wood itself  and yet Numa had not appeared.  As he drew himself up to the lower  branches he commenced to wonder if Numa were in the cave after  all. Could it be possible that he had forced the barrier of rocks  with which Tarzan had plugged the other end of the passage where  it opened into the outer world of freedom? Or was Numa dead?  The  ape-man doubted the verity of the latter suggestion as he had fed  the lion the entire carcasses of a deer and a hyena only a few  days since--he could not have starved in so short a time, while the  little rivulet running across the gulch furnished him with water  a-plenty.    Tarzan started to descend and investigate the cavern when it occurred  to him that it would save effort were he to lure Numa out instead.  Acting upon the thought he uttered a low growl. Immediately he was  rewarded by the sound of a movement within the cave and an instant  later a wild-eyed, haggard lion rushed forth ready to face the  devil himself were he edible.  When Numa saw Tarzan, fat and sleek,  perched in the tree he became suddenly the embodiment of frightful  rage. His eyes and his nose told him that this was the creature  responsible for his predicament and also that this creature was  good to eat. Frantically the lion sought to scramble up the bole of  the tree. Twice he leaped high enough to catch the lowest branches  with his paws, but both times he fell backward to the earth. Each  time he became more furious. His growls and roars were incessant  and horrible and all the time Tarzan sat grinning down upon him,  taunting him in jungle billingsgate for his inability to reach  him and mentally exulting that always Numa was wasting his already  waning strength.    Finally the ape-man rose and un-slung his rope. He arranged the  coils carefully in his left hand and the noose in his right, and  then he took a position with each foot on one of two branches that  lay in about the same horizontal plane and with his back pressed  firmly against the stem of the tree. There he stood hurling insults  at Numa until the beast was again goaded into leaping upward at  him, and as Numa rose the noose dropped quickly over his head and  about his neck. A quick movement of Tarzan's rope hand tightened  the coil and when Numa slipped backward to the ground only his hind  feet touched, for the ape-man held him swinging by the neck.    Moving slowly outward upon the two branches Tarzan swung Numa out  so that he could not reach the bole of the tree with his raking  talons, then he made the rope fast after drawing the lion clear  of the ground, dropped his five pigskin sacks to earth and leaped  down himself. Numa was striking frantically at the grass rope with  his fore claws. At any moment he might sever it and Tarzan must,  therefore, work rapidly.    First he drew the larger bag over Numa's head and secured it about  his neck with the draw string, then he managed, after considerable  effort, during which he barely escaped being torn to ribbons by  the mighty talons, to hog-tie Numa--drawing his four legs together  and securing them in that position with the strips trimmed from  the pigskins.    By this time the lion's efforts had almost ceased--it was evident  that he was being rapidly strangled and as that did not at all  suit the purpose of the Tarmangani the latter swung again into the  tree, unfastened the rope from above and lowered the lion to the  ground where he immediately followed it and loosed the noose about  Numa's neck. Then he drew his hunting knife and cut two round holes  in the front of the head bag opposite the lion's eyes for the double  purpose of permitting him to see and giving him sufficient air to  breathe.    This done Tarzan busied himself fitting the other bags, one over  each of Numa's formidably armed paws. Those on the hind feet he  secured not "]]]
