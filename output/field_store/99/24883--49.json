[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#9)"],[1," For from what we  could see from our window we immediately voted tropical vegetation quite  up to advertisement: whole trees of gaudy red or yellow or bright orange  blossoms, flowering vines, flowering shrubs, peered over the walls or  through the fences; and behind them rose great mangoes or the slenderer  shafts of bananas and cocoanut palms.    Up and down wandered groups of various sorts of natives. A month later  we would have been able to identify their different tribes and to know  more about them; but now we wondered at them, as strange and  picturesque peoples. They impressed us in general as being a fine lot of  men, for they were of good physique, carried themselves well, and looked  about them with a certain dignity and independence, a fine free pride of  carriage and of step. This fact alone differentiated them from our own  negroes; but, further, their features were in general much finer, and  their skins of a clear mahogany beautiful in its satiny texture.  Most--and these were the blackest--wore long white robes and fine  openwork skull caps. They were the local race, the Swahili, had we but  known it; the original \"Zanzibari\" who furnished Livingstone, Stanley,  Speke, and the other early explorers with their men. Others, however,  were much less \"civilized.\" We saw one \"Cook's tour from the jungle\"  consisting of six savages, their hair twisted into innumerable points,  their ear lobes stretched to hang fairly to their shoulders, wearing  only a rather neglectful blanket, adorned with polished wire, carrying  war clubs and bright spears. They followed, with eyes and mouths open, a  very sophisticated-looking city cousin in the usual white garments,  swinging a jaunty, light bamboo cane. The cane seems to be a  distinguishing mark of the leisured class. It not only means that you  are not working, but also that you have no earthly desire to work.    About this time one of the hotel boys brought the inevitable  chota-hazri--the tea and biscuits of early morning. For this once it was  very welcome.    Our hotel proved to be on the direct line of freighting. There are no  horses or draught animals in Mombasa; the fly is too deadly. Therefore  all hauling is done by hand. The tiny tracks of the unique street car  system run everywhere any one would wish to go; branching off even into  private grounds and to the very front doors of bungalows situated far  out of town. Each resident owns his own street car, just as elsewhere a  man has his own carriage. There are, of course, public cars also, each  with its pair of boys to push it; and also a number of rather decrepit  rickshaws. As a natural corollary to the passenger traffic, the  freighting also is handled by the blacks on large flat trucks with short  guiding poles. These men are quite naked save for a small loin cloth;  are beautifully shaped; and glisten all over with perspiration shining  in the sun. So fine is the texture of their skins, the softness of their  colour--so rippling the play of muscles--that this shining perspiration  is like a beautiful polish. They rush from behind, slowly and steadily,  and patiently and unwaveringly, the most tremendous loads of the  heaviest stuffs. When the hill becomes too steep for them, they turn  their backs against the truck; and by placing one foot behind the other,  a few inches at a time, they edge their burden up the slope.    The steering is done by one man at the pole or tongue in front. This  individual also sets the key to the song by which in Africa all heavy  labour is carried forward. He cries his wavering shrill-voiced chant;  the toilers utter antiphony in low gruff tones. At a distance one hears  only the wild high syncopated chanting; but as the affair draws slowly  nearer, he catches the undertone of the responses. These latter are cast  in the regular swing and rhythm of effort; but the steersman throws in  his bit at odd and irregular intervals. Thus:    Headman (shrill): \"Hay, ah mon!\"    Pushers (gruff in rhythm): \"Tunk!--tunk!--tunk!--\" or:    Headman (and wavering minor chant): \"Ah--nah--nee--e-e-e!\"    Pushers (undertone): \"Umbwa--jo-e! Um-bwa--jo--e!\"    These wild and barbaric chantings--in the distance; near at hand; dying  into distance again--slow, dogged, toilsome, came to be to us one of the  typical features of the place.    After breakfast we put on our sun helmets and went forth curiously to  view the town. We found it roughly divided into four quarters--the old  Portuguese, the Arabic, the European, and the native. The Portuguese  comprises the outer fringe next the water-front of the inner bay. It is  very narrow of street, with whitewashed walls, balconies, and wonderful  carven and studded doors. The business of the town is done here. The  Arabic quarter lies back of it--a maze of narrow alleys winding  aimlessly here and there between high white buildings, with occasionally  the minarets and towers of a mosque. This district harboured, besides  the upper-class Swahilis and Arabs, a large number of East Indians.  Still back of this are thousands of the low grass, or mud and wattle  huts of the natives, their roofs thatched with straw or palm. These are  apparently arranged on little system. The small European population  lives atop the sea bluffs beyond the old fort in the most attractive  bungalows. This, the most desirable location of all, has remained open  to them because heretofore the fierce wars with which Mombasa, \"the  Island of Blood,\" has been swept have made the exposed seaward lands  impossible.    No idle occupation can be more fascinating than to wander about the  mazes of this ancient town. The variety of race and occupation is  something astounding. Probably the one human note that, everywhere  persisting, draws the whole together is furnished by the water-carriers.  Mombasa has no water system whatever. The entire supply is drawn from  numberless picturesque wells scattered everywhere in the crowded centre,  and distributed mainly in Standard Oil cans suspended at either end of a  short pole. By dint of constant daily exercise, hauling water up from a  depth and carrying it various distances, these men have developed the  most beautifully powerful figures. They proceed at a half trot, the  slender poles, with forty pounds at either end, seeming fairly to cut  into their naked shoulders, muttering a word of warning to the loiterers  at every other breath--semeelay! semeelay! No matter in what part of  Mombasa you may happen to be, or at what hour of the day or night, you  will meet these industrious little men trotting along under their  burdens.    Everywhere also are the women, carrying themselves proudly erect, with a  free swing of the hips. They wear invariably a single sheet of cotton  cloth printed in blue or black with the most astonishing borders and  spotty designs. This is drawn tight just above the breasts, leaving the  shoulders and arms bare. Their hair is divided into perhaps a dozen  parts running lengthwise of the head from the forehead to the nape of  the neck, after the manner of the stripes on a watermelon. Each part  then ends in a tiny twisted pigtail not over an inch long. The lobes of  their ears have been stretched until they hold thick round disks about  three inches in diameter, ornamented by concentric circles of different  colours, with a red bull's eye for a centre. The outer edges of the ears  are then further decorated with gold clasps set closely together. Many  bracelets, necklaces, and armlets complete the get-up. They are big  women, with soft velvety skins and a proud and haughty carriage--the  counterparts of the men in the white robes and caps.    By the way, it may be a good place here to remark that these garments,  and the patterned squares of cloth worn by the women, are invariably  most spotlessly clean.    These, we learned, were the Swahilis, the ruling class, the descendants  of the slave traders. Beside them are all sorts and conditions. Your  true savage pleased his own fancy as to dress and personal adornment.  The bushmen generally shaved the edges of their wool to leave a nice  close-fitting natural skull cap, wore a single blanket draped from one  shoulder, and carried a war club. The ear lobe seemed always to be  stretched; sometimes sufficiently to have carried a pint bottle. Indeed,  white marmalade jars seemed to be very popular wear. One ingenious  person had acquired a dozen of the sort of safety pins used to fasten  curtains to their rings. These he had snapped into the lobes, six on a  side.    We explored for some time. One of the Swahilis attached himself to us so  unobtrusively that before we knew it we had accepted him as guide. In  that capacity he realized an ideal, for he never addressed a word to us,  nor did he even stay in sight. We wandered along at our sweet will,  dawdling as slowly as we pleased. The guide had apparently quite  disappeared. Look where we would we could in no manner discover him. At  the next corner we would pause, undecided as to what to do; there, in  the middle distance, would stand our friend, smiling. When he was sure  we had seen him, and were about to take the turn properly, he would  disappear again. Convoyed in this pleasant fashion we wound and twisted  up and down and round and about through the most appalling maze. We saw  the native markets with their vociferating sellers seated cross-legged  on tables behind piles of fruit or vegetables, while an equally  vociferating crowd surged up and down the aisles. Gray parrots and  little monkeys perched everywhere about. Billy gave one of the monkeys a  banana. He peeled it exactly as a man would have done, smelt it  critically, and threw it back at her in the most insulting fashion. We  saw also the rows of Hindu shops open to the street, with their gaudily  dressed children of blackened eyelids, their stolid dirty proprietors,  and their women marvellous in bright silks and massive bangles.

I lay the wager!    _Mephistopheles_. Done!    _Faust_. And heartily!  Whenever to the passing hour  I cry: O stay! thou art so fair!  To chain me down I give thee power  To the black bottom of despair!  Then let my knell no longer linger,  Then from my service thou art free,  Fall from the clock the index-finger,  Be time all over, then, for me!    _Mephistopheles_. Think well, for we shall hold you to the letter.    _Faust_. Full right to that just now I gave;  I spoke not as an idle braggart better.  Henceforward I remain a slave,  What care I who puts on the setter?    _Mephistopheles_. I shall this very day, at Doctor's-feast,[16]  My bounden service duly pay thee.  But one thing!--For insurance' sake, I pray thee,  Grant me a line or two, at least.    _Faust_. Pedant! will writing gain thy faith, alone?  In all thy life, no man, nor man's word hast thou known?  Is't not enough that I the fatal word  That passes on my future days have spoken?  The world-stream raves and rushes (hast not heard?)  And shall a promise hold, unbroken?  Yet this delusion haunts the human breast,  Who from his soul its roots would sever?  Thrice happy in whose heart pure truth finds rest.  No sacrifice shall he repent of ever!  But from a formal, written, sealed attest,  As from a spectre, all men shrink forever.  The word and spirit die together,  Killed by the sight of wax and leather.  What wilt thou, evil sprite, from me?  Brass, marble, parchment, paper, shall it be?  Shall I subscribe with pencil, pen or graver?  Among them all thy choice is free.    _Mephistopheles_. This rhetoric of thine to me  Hath a somewhat bombastic savor.  Any small scrap of paper's good.  Thy signature will need a single drop of blood.[17]    _Faust_. If this will satisfy thy mood,  I will consent thy whim to favor.    _Mephistopheles._ Quite a peculiar juice is blood.    _Faust_. Fear not that I shall break this bond; O, never!  My promise, rightly understood,  Fulfils my nature's whole endeavor.  I've puffed myself too high, I see;  To _thy_ rank only I belong.  The Lord of Spirits scorneth me,  Nature, shut up, resents the wrong.  The thread of thought is snapt asunder,  All science to me is a stupid blunder.  Let us in sensuality's deep  Quench the passions within us blazing!  And, the veil of sorcery raising,  Wake each miracle from its long sleep!  Plunge we into the billowy dance,  The rush and roll of time and chance!  Then may pleasure and distress,  Disappointment and success,  Follow each other as fast as they will;  Man's restless activity flourishes still.    _Mephistopheles_. No bound or goal is set to you;  Where'er you like to wander sipping,  And catch a tit-bit in your skipping,  Eschew all coyness, just fall to,  And may you find a good digestion!    _Faust_. Now, once for all, pleasure is not the question.  I'm sworn to passion's whirl, the agony of bliss,  The lover's hate, the sweets of bitterness.  My heart, no more by pride of science driven,  Shall open wide to let each sorrow enter,  And all the good that to man's race is given,  I will enjoy it to my being's centre,  Through life's whole range, upward and downward sweeping,  Their weal and woe upon my bosom heaping,  Thus in my single self their selves all comprehending  And with them in a common shipwreck ending.    _Mephistopheles_. O trust me, who since first I fell from heaven,  Have chewed this tough meat many a thousand year,  No man digests the ancient leaven,  No mortal, from the cradle to the bier.  Trust one of _us_--the _whole_ creation  To God alone belongs by right;  _He_ has in endless day his habitation,  _Us_ He hath made for utter night,  _You_ for alternate dark and light.    _Faust_. But then I _will!_    _Mephistopheles_. Now that's worth hearing!  But one thing haunts me, the old song,  That time is short and art is long.  You need some slight advice, I'm fearing.  Take to you one of the poet-feather,  Let the gentleman's thought, far-sweeping,  Bring all the noblest traits together,  On your one crown their honors heaping,  The lion's mood  The stag's rapidity,  The fiery blood of Italy,  The Northman's hardihood.  Bid him teach thee the art of combining  Greatness of soul with fly designing,  And how, with warm and youthful passion,  To fall in love by plan and fashion.  Should like, myself, to come across 'm,  Would name him Mr. Microcosm.    _Faust_. What am I then? if that for which my heart  Yearns with invincible endeavor,  The crown of man, must hang unreached forever?    _Mephistopheles_. Thou art at last--just what thou art.  Pile perukes on thy head whose curls cannot be counted,  On yard-high buskins let thy feet be mounted,  Still thou art only what thou art.    _Faust_. Yes, I have vainly, let me not deny it,  Of human learning ransacked all the stores,  And when, at last, I set me down in quiet,  There gushes up within no new-born force;  I am not by a hair's-breadth higher,  Am to the Infinite no nigher.    _Mephistopheles_. My worthy sir, you see the matter  As people generally see;  But we must learn to take things better,  Before life pleasures wholly flee.  The deuce! thy head and all that's in it,  Hands, feet and ------ are thine;  What I enjoy with zest each minute,  Is surely not the less mine?  If I've six horses in my span,  Is it not mine, their every power?  I fly along as an undoubted man,  On four and twenty legs the road I scour.  Cheer up, then! let all thinking be,  And out into the world with me!  I tell thee, friend, a speculating churl  Is like a beast, some evil spirit chases  Along a barren heath in one perpetual whirl,  While round about lie fair, green pasturing places.    _Faust_. But how shall we begin?    _Mephistopheles_. We sally forth e'en now.  What martyrdom endurest thou!  What kind of life is this to be living,  Ennui to thyself and youngsters giving?  Let Neighbor Belly that way go!  To stay here threshing straw why car'st thou?  The best that thou canst think and know  To tell the boys not for the whole world dar'st thou.  E'en now I hear one in the entry.    _Faust_. I have no heart the youth to see.    _Mephistopheles_. The poor boy waits there like a sentry,  He shall not want a word from me.  Come, give me, now, thy robe and bonnet;  This mask will suit me charmingly.             [_He puts them on_.]  Now for my wit--rely upon it!  'Twill take but fifteen minutes, I am sure.  Meanwhile prepare thyself to make the pleasant tour!               [_Exit_ FAUST.]    _Mephistopheles [in_ FAUST'S _long gown_].  Only despise all human wit and lore,  The highest flights that thought can soar--  Let but the lying spirit blind thee,  And with his spells of witchcraft bind thee,  Into my snare the victim creeps.--  To him has destiny a spirit given,  That unrestrainedly still onward sweeps,  To scale the skies long since hath striven,  And all earth's pleasures overleaps.  He shall through life's wild scenes be driven,  And through its flat unmeaningness,  I'll make him writhe and stare and stiffen,  And midst all sensual excess,  His fevered lips, with thirst all parched and riven,  Insatiably shall haunt refreshment's brink;  And had he not, himself, his soul to Satan given,  Still must he to perdition sink!              [_Enter_ A SCHOLAR.]    _Scholar_. I have but lately left my home,  And with profound submission come,  To hold with one some conversation  Whom all men name with veneration.    _Mephistopheles._ Your courtesy greatly flatters me  A man like many another you see.  Have you made any applications elsewhere?    _Scholar_. Let me, I pray, your teachings share!  With all good dispositions I come,  A fresh young blood and money some;  My mother would hardly hear of my going;  But I long to learn here something worth knowing.    _Mephistopheles_. You've come to the very place for it, then.    _Scholar_. Sincerely, could wish I were off again:  My soul already has grown quite weary  Of walls and halls, so dark and dreary,  The narrowness oppresses me.  One sees no green thing, not a tree.  On the lecture-seats, I know not what ails me,  Sight, hearing, thinking, every thing fails me.    _Mephistopheles_. 'Tis all in use, we daily see.  The child takes not the mother's breast  In the first instance willingly,  But soon it feeds itself with zest.  So you at wisdom's breast your pleasure  Will daily find in growing measure.    _Scholar_. I'll hang upon her neck, a raptured wooer,  But only tell me, who shall lead me to her?    _Mephistopheles_. Ere you go further, give your views  As to which faculty you choose?    _Scholar_. To be right learn'd I've long desired,  And of the natural world aspired  To have a perfect comprehension  In this and in the heavenly sphere.    _Mephistopheles_. I see you're on the right track here;  But you'll have to give undivided attention.    _Scholar_. My heart and soul in the work'll be found;  Only, of course, it would give me pleasure,  When summer holidays come round,  To have for amusement a little leisure.    _Mephistopheles_. Use well the precious time, it flips away so,  Yet method gains you time, if I may say so.  I counsel you therefore, my worthy friend,  The logical leisures first to attend.  Then is your mind well trained and cased  In Spanish boots,[18] all snugly laced,  So that henceforth it can creep ahead  On the road of thought with a cautious tread.  And not at random shoot and strike,  Zig-zagging Jack-o'-lanthorn-like.  Then will you many a day be taught  That what you once to do had thought  Like eating and drinking, extempore,  Requires the rule of one, two, three.  It is, to be sure, with the fabric of thought,  As with the _chef d'oeuvre_ by weavers wrought,  Where a thousand threads one treadle plies,  Backward and forward the shuttles keep going,  Invisibly the threads keep flowing,  One stroke a thousand"]]]
