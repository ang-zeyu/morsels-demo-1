Vague notions about ancestral  and familiar spirits that emanate from the grave in the guise of snakes  or other animals are accepted in the same spirit or traditional mood in  which the doctrines and dogmas of the various religions of Europe are  accepted by the bulk of white believers.    I have found among the Bantu the same child-like faith in all that is  proclaimed by traditional authority about things supernatural, and I  have found also among them the same hesitation or inability to believe  without questioning in all that is laid down in the name of tradition  that we see among ourselves. The will to believe is temperamental and  general, but the unbeliever is found among the Bantu as well as  everywhere else.    I remember that I asked a raw Native once what he thought about the  after-life in which so many white and black people professed to believe.  He answered: \"The white people are a clever race; they see many things  in their books; perhaps they can see even beyond death. I do not say  that they are liars, as some of our people sometimes say. They may know  these things, I do not. All I know is that when I die this breath that  is now in me so that I am able to think and speak will leave my body  which then must be put away in the ground: I think that will be the end  of me--but, not quite, for there,\"--here he pointed to his infant son  who was toddling about in the strong sunlight--\"there in him, my son,\"  and his voice grew tender as he spoke, \"I shall live on because he is  part of me, my life is in him; I cannot die altogether so long as he  lives, but if he should die and not leave a son to carry on my life,  then should I die the death utterly.\"    I recollect that when I wrote these clear words of an honest doubter  there came to mind the old Arab saying: \"Whosoever leaveth no male hath  no memory,\" which is but a confession of that sense of doubt that has  haunted the minds of men of all races and at all times while the people  as a whole have professed their hope and belief in a life everlasting.    I discussed the matter of polygamy with a Native youth one day, and made  a note of his argument. He said:    \"In our district the young women are beginning to go against the man who  wants more than one wife. I have a young wife, and when I talk to her  about taking a second wife she says that she will not suffer it. She  says that the white people do well in that the man and his wife grow old  together, whereas we Natives, as she says, we are like the cattle in the  kraal; we do not behave like human beings. But to this I answered that  our fathers and mothers taught us that one wife by herself cannot be  happy and comfortable because when she falls sick, as women often do,  there is no one to help her, whereas when a man has two or more wives  they can help and nurse one another, they need not be sad or unhappy. I  think our fathers way is the good way and I shall follow it, but I know  there will be trouble because of the new thoughts my wife has taken from  the white people.\"    Now I do not say that these instances show any remarkable intelligence  or power of thinking, but I do say that they show sound level-headed  reasoning just like the common sense reasoning from cause and effect  which we find in the average European, and that they show, moreover,  that the same types of mental disposition and capacity are found in  black and white alike.    It would indeed be easy for me to continue giving instances like these  to show the essential sameness of the nature of the minds of the black  and white people, but I must consider the weight of my book and the  readers patience. I have refrained from pointing to those Natives who  have proved their scholastic capabilities at various universities and  colleges because it is generally surmised that these men are exceptional  or that their success is due to a highly developed imitative faculty  coupled with a strong memory, with which it is fashionable to credit the  successful Native student, and I have advisedly confined myself to  instances drawn from the everyday life and thought of the normal and  uneducated Native people.    I have lived amongst the Bantu for nearly thirty years and I have  studied them closely, and I have come to the conclusion that there is no  Native mind distinct from the common human mind. The mind of the Native  is the mind of all mankind; it is not separate or different from the  mind of the European or the Asiatic any more than the mind of the  English is different from that of the Scotch or Irish people. The  English way of speaking differs from that of the French, but there is no  reason for thinking that the mind of the two people differs in any way  whatever. The languages of the world are many but the mind of the world  is one.    There are, I know, some white men who talk knowingly about a Native mind  which they allege to be unlike their own, a mind of whose strange  anfractuosities they profess a special knowledge, but these people must  not be taken seriously. They are always half-educated men, suffering,  as Cardinal Newman said, from that haziness of intellectual vision which  is so common among all those who have not had a really good education.  These people pretend to a knowledge which is impossible, seeing that we  can only know and understand the minds of other people by assuming that  they are like our own so that if we postulate a Native mind different  from our own it must of necessity remain unknowable by us, for what is  psychology but the power of understanding others from our understanding  of ourselves?    The judge on the bench and the priest in the confessional follow the  thoughts and feelings of the minds they have to deal with, not by virtue  of any special power of divination, but simply by judging their  fellow-men's way of thinking and feeling to be even as their own.    The truth of the matter is that all men think in the same way, but not  always about the same things. There is no such thing as an inherent  racial mind but there are different national and racial cultures lasting  sometimes for centuries, like that of China, and some times only for a  generation, like that of modern Germany. But these differences are  temporary and outward and not inwardly heritable. The difference between  the mind of the philosopher and the plough-boy is one not of kind, not  even of degree, but of content. The things that occupy the mind of the  peasant farmer are not the same that fill the mind of the university  don, but if the respective environments of the two types had been  reversed the professor might have thought about manure and the farmer  about metaphysics. And this holds good also of nations and races.  Consider, for instance, the German people who before the rise of  Bismarck were looked upon as a nation of peaceful peasants and  _Gelerhten_, \"_ces bons Allemands_,\" in contemporary French parlance,  and how they became within a few years through being made to think  constantly about their own national supremacy, a race of ruthless  warriors that terrorised and nearly conquered Europe in the Great World  War. The mind of the German race had not been changed, but the main  business of that mind had been changed through the imposition on the  growing masses of a new ideal, the ideal of dominion in the hands of the  German people.    The difference between the mental status of the white man and the Native  is the same as that which we notice between the man who has had a  liberal education and the man who has not, and it lies mainly in the  fact that the one is given to introspection, analysis and criticism  whereas the other, whether he be a European peasant or a Bantu herdsman,  looks outward, takes things for granted and asks no questions, so that  with the Bantu as with the illiterate European, the primitive thoughts  and ways of their forefathers are held good enough by their sons, but  this does not preclude the latent potentiality in both for the  understanding and acquisition of new thoughts and ways once the shackles  of conservatism have been loosened and cast aside.    In his thinking about the things he knows the black man comes to the  same conclusion as the white man when he thinks about the same things.  The black man does not think about electricity or the differential  calculus because he knows nothing about these matters, neither, and for  the same reason, does the European peasant wherever he may still be  found in his primitive state. It has been alleged in America and in  South Africa that Negro and Bantu children, when compared with European  children in both countries, show not only comparative slowness in the  study of arithmetic, but that they are on the whole less accurate in  their work, and this I readily believe, for the reason that the home  surroundings of the black children are seldom as favourable to the  development of speed and exactness as they are among Europeans. It is  not considered \"good form\" among Natives to do things in a hurry,  slowness is regarded as essential to good manners; moreover the craving  for speed and exactitude is everywhere a feature of high-pressure city  life rather than of life in the country. The town artisan of to-day must  be quick and accurate, whereas the agricultural labourer is found  satisfactory so long as he is a steady worker, and the home atmosphere  of the two types is bound to be affected by these considerations. The  home atmosphere of the ordinary Bantu family in process of acquiring the  ways of Western civilisation will be more like that of the agricultural  labourer than of the town artisan or shopkeeper, and it is conceded on  every hand that the home influence has a direct and important bearing on  the children's progress in school.

Lulu was standing a little apart from the rest, gazing out of the window  upon the moonlit lawn, when a step drew near; then some one took her by  the arm, and in a twinkling she found herself seated upon a gentleman's  knee.    Looking up into his face, she saw that it was Mr. Horace Dinsmore who had  thus taken possession of her.    \"Well, my little dark-eyed lassie,\" he said, \"no one has thought it worth  while to introduce us, but we won't let that hinder our making  acquaintance. Do you know who I am?\"    \"I heard Rosie call you Uncle Horace.\"    \"Then suppose you follow Rosie's example. If you are as good as you are  bonny, I shall be proud to claim you as my niece.\"    \"But I'm not,\" she said frankly. Then hastily correcting herself, \"I don't  mean to say I'm bonny, but I'm not good. Aunt Beulah used to say I was the  worst child she ever saw.\"    \"Indeed! you are honest, at all events,\" he said, with a look of  amusement. \"And who is Aunt Beulah?\"    \"The person Gracie and I lived with before papa got married to Mamma Vi.\"    \"Ah! well I shall not regard her opinion, but wait and form one for  myself, and I shall certainly be much surprised if you don't turn out a  pattern good girl, now that you are to live with my sweet sister Elsie. In  the mean while, will it please you to call me Uncle Horace?\"    \"Yes, sir, since you ask me to,\" Lulu replied, looking much gratified.    At this moment the door opened, and Mr. Lacey walked in. He had come for  his wife, and when he and the others had exchanged greetings, she rose to  make ready for departure.    Calhoun Conly rose also, saying to his brother, \"Well, Art, perhaps it  would be as well for us to go, too; our friends must be tired after their  long journey, and will want to get to bed early.\"    \"Suppose you all delay a little and unite with us in evening family  worship,\" said Mr. Dinsmore. \"It is a good while since I have had all  three of my children present with me at such a service.\"    All complied with his request, and immediately afterward took leave. Then  with an exchange of affectionate good-nights the family separated and  scattered to their rooms.    Lulu was not quite ready for bed when Violet came in, and putting her arm  around her, asked, with a gentle kiss, \"Do you feel strange and lonely in  this new place, little girl?\"    \"Oh, no, Mamma Vi! it seems such a nice home that I am very glad to be in  it.\"    \"That is right,\" Violet said, repeating her caress. \"I hope you will sleep  well and wake refreshed. I shall leave the door open between your room and  mine, so that you need not feel timid, and can run right in to me whenever  you wish. Good-night, dear.\"    \"Good-night, Mamma Vi. Thank you for being so good to me, and to Gracie  and Max,\" Lulu said, clinging to her in an affectionate way.    \"My child,\" returned Violet, \"how could I be anything else to the children  of my dear husband? Ah, I must go! Mamma calls me,\" she added, hurrying  away as a soft, sweet voice was heard coming from the adjoining room.    Lulu finished undressing, said her prayers, and had just laid her head on  her pillow, when some one glided noiselessly to the bedside and a soft  hand passed caressingly over her hair.    The child opened her eyes, which had already closed in sleep, and saw by  the moonlight a sweet and beautiful face bending lovingly over her.    \"Grandma Elsie,\" she murmured sleepily.    \"Yes, dear. Rosie and Walter never like to go to sleep without a  good-night kiss from mamma, and you must have the same now, as you are to  be one of my dear children.\"    Lulu, now wide awake, started up to put both arms round the neck of her  visitor. \"Oh, I do love you!\" she said, \"and I'll try hard to be a good  child to you.\"    \"I believe it, dear,\" Elsie said, pressing the child to her heart. \"Will  you join my children in their half-hour with mamma in her dressing-room  before breakfast? I shall be glad to have you, but you must do just as you  please about it.\"    \"Thank you, ma'am; I'll come,\" said Lulu.    \"That is right. Now lie down and go to sleep. You need a long night's  rest.\"          CHAPTER VII.        \"Her fancy followed him through foaming wares       To distant shores.\"                                  --Cowper.      Violet in her night-dress and with her beautiful hair unbound and hanging  about her like a golden cloud, stood before her dressing-table, gazing  through a mist of unshed tears upon a miniature which she held in her  hand.    \"Ah, where are you now, love?\" she sighed half aloud.    Her mother's voice answered close at her side, in gentle, tender accents,  \"In God's keeping, my darling. He is the God of the sea as well as of the  land.\"    \"Yes, mamma, and his God as well as mine,\" Violet responded, looking up  and smiling through her tears. \"Ah, what comfort in both assurances, and  in the precious promise, 'Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in  all places whither thou goest.' It is his and it is mine.\"    \"Yes, dearest. I feel for you in your loneliness,\" her mother said,  putting her arms around her. \"Elsie is very happy in her husband and  baby, Edward in his wife; they need me but little, comparatively, but you  and I must draw close together and be a comfort and support to each other;  shall we not, my love?\"    \"Yes, indeed, dearest mamma. Oh, what a comfort and blessing you are to  me, and always have been! And I am happier and less lonely for having my  husband's children with me, especially my darling little Gracie. I feel  that in caring for her and nursing her back to health I shall be adding to  his happiness.\"    \"As no doubt you will,\" her mother said. \"It will be a pleasure to me to  help you care for her, and the others also. Now, good-night, daughter; we  both ought to be in bed.\"    Violet presently stretched herself beside the sleeping Gracie with a  murmured word of endearment drew the child closer to her, and in another  moment was sharing her slumbers.    When she awoke the sun was shining, and the first object her eyes rested  upon was the little face by her side. The pallor and look of exhaustion it  had worn the night before were quite gone, a faint tinge of pink had even  stolen into the cheeks.    Violet noted the change with a feeling of relief and thankfulness, and  raising herself upon her elbow, touched her lips lightly to the white  forehead.    The child's eyes flew open and with a sweet engaging smile, she asked,  \"Have you been lying beside me all night, mamma?\"    \"Yes, Gracie. You have had a long sleep, dear; do you feel quite rested?\"    \"Yes, mamma, I feel very well. This is such a nice soft bed, and I like to  sleep with you. May I always?\"    \"For all winter, I think, dear. I like to have your papa's baby girl by my  side.\"    \"I'm very much obliged to him for finding me such a sweet, pretty new  mamma. I told him so one day,\" remarked the child innocently, putting an  arm about Vi's neck.    \"Did you?\" Violet asked with an amused smile; \"and what did he say?\"    \"Nothing; he just smiled and hugged me tight and kissed me ever so many  times. Do you know what made him do that, mamma?\"    \"Because he likes to have us love one another. And so we will, won't we,  dear?\"    \"Yes, indeed! Mamma, I feel a little hungry.\"    \"I'm glad to hear it, for here comes Agnes with a glass of nice rich milk  for you. And when you have drunk it she will wash and dress you. We will  all have to hurry a little to be ready in good time for breakfast,\" she  added, springing from the bed and beginning her toilet. \"Grandpa Dinsmore  never likes to have us late.\"    \"Miss Rosie and Miss Lulu's up and dressed and gone into Miss Elsie's  room, Miss Wilet,\" remarked Agnes, holding the tumbler she had brought to  Gracie's lips.    \"Ah, that is well,\" said Violet, with a pleased look. \"Lulu has stolen a  march on us, Gracie.\"    The week that followed their arrival at Ion was a delightful one to all,  especially the children, who had scarce anything to do but enjoy  themselves. The weather was all that could be desired, and they walked,  rode, drove, boated, fished, and went nutting.    Mr. Dinsmore and Edward were every day more or less busied with the  affairs of the plantation, but some one of the older people could always  find time to be with the children, while Zoe never failed to make one of  the party, and seemed almost as much a child as any of the younger ones.    Every nook on the plantation and in its neighborhood was explored, and  visits were paid to Fairview, the Laurels, the Pines, the Oaks, Roselands  and Ashlands; the dwellers at each place having first called upon the  family at Ion.    Both Max and Lulu had long desired to learn to ride on horseback, and  great was their delight on learning that now this wish could be gratified.    A pony was always at the service of each, and lessons in the art of  sitting and managing it were given them, now by Mr. Dinsmore and now by  Edward, who was a great admirer of his brother-in-law, Captain Raymond,  had become much attached to him, and took a very kindly interest in his  children.    Gracie was given a share in all the pleasures for which she was considered  strong enough, and when not able to go with the others on their  expeditions, was well entertained at home with toys and books filled with  pictures and stories suited to her age.    Both Elsie and Violet watched over the little girl with true motherly love  and care; she warmly returning the affection of both, but clinging  especially to Violet, her \"pretty new mamma.\"    Gracie was a docile little creature, and seemed very happy in her new  life. She was deeply interested in the riding lessons of her brother and  sister, and when, near the end of the week, Dr. Arthur, to whom she was  becoming much attached, set her on the back of a Shetland pony and led it  about the grounds for a few"]]]
