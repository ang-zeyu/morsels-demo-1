Now if this same charge of powder be collected and  reloaded into a new cartridge case and well confined behind wads and a  charge of shot, as above explained, it will all burn, giving the same  results as black powder.    Attempts have been made to use this powder in pistols and revolvers, but  here it has proved a failure, as the pressure is not great enough to  cause the powder to be consumed, unless it be in the form of very fine  grains or dust, in which case the pressure mounts too high. However,  this might be overcome to a degree by making the powder porous. The  chemical conditions of the powder might be the same, but the physical  conditions must be different. A powder suitable for shot guns and  pistols would not be suitable for rifles.    One not familiar with the characteristics of smokeless powder would be  almost certain to fail in his first attempt to fire it. Many persons  have been convinced by their first experiments that this powder would  not burn at all in a gun, any more than so much sand.    Smokeless powder is consumed with a rapidity which accords with the  conditions of its confinement. Therefore, the bullets which have been  experimented with by different governments have been the cause of much  of the varying pressures attributed to the smokeless powders.    The Austrians use the Mannlicher steel jacketed bullet. The steel casing  or jacket is first tinned on the inside and then the lead is cast in,  thus melting the tin and adhering firmly to the jacket. This projectile  sets up enormous friction in the barrel of the gun when used with  smokeless powder; as the smokeless powder leaves the gun barrel  perfectly clean and the two steel surfaces being in absolute contact  cause tremendous friction; and as the coefficient of friction varies  with every shot, the pressure in the gun constantly varies greatly.    The German silver covered bullet used by the French has the disadvantage  that when firing rapidly the chamber of the barrel becomes nickel plated  and great friction is caused, mounting up the pressures and causing the  muzzle velocities to fall off.    The Austrians, in order to prevent their steel cased bullets from  rusting and to lessen the friction in the barrel of the gun, cover them  with a heavy lubricant, which gives the cartridges an unsightly  appearance and causes them to gather dust and sand. The French employ a  lubricant at the base of the projectile, with a small copper disk  between the same and the powder.    Col. A.R. Buffington, commander of the National Armory at Springfield,  Mass., has made a steel covered projectile which he prevents from  rusting by blackening by a niter process. Several grooves are pressed in  the base of the bullet which carry a lubricant, and when the bullet is  inserted in the cartridge case the grooves are covered by it.  Furthermore, these grooves prevent the lead filling from bursting  through the steel casing, leaving the latter in the barrel, as often  occurs with the Austrian and French projectiles when using smokeless  powder.    A new projectile has lately come out, the invention of Captain Edward  Palliser, of the British army. This bullet consists of a jacket made of  very soft Swedish wrought iron, coated with zinc and filled with lead,  the lead being pressed into this jacket. The bullet is corrugated at its  base, after the manner of the one made by Colonel Buffington. This  projectile has been experimented with very extensively by the British  government, and at the works of the Maxim-Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition  Company, in England. The zinc coating of the bullet is too soft to stick  to the barrel of the gun, and also in a measure acts as a lubricant.  This projectile has given better results than any other that has been  experimented with. The great velocities and the most uniform pressures  by the use of smokeless powder have been attained with this Palliser  bullet.      NOISELESSNESS.    A great many stories have been told about the noiselessness of smokeless  powder. But there is no such thing as a noiseless gunpowder. The report  of a gun charged with smokeless powder is very sharp, and is as loud as  when black powder is used, yet the volume of sound is much less, so that  the report cannot be heard at so great a distance.    The report of a gun using smokeless powder is a sound of much higher  pitch than when black powder is used, and consequently cannot be heard  at so great a distance as the lower notes given by black powder.    As smokeless powder exerts a much greater pressure than common black  powder when burned in a gun, one would naturally think that the recoil  of the barrel would be greater, owing to the greater pressure exerted by  the smokeless powder on the base of the cartridge case and the breech  mechanism. However, such is not the fact; for the barrel actually  recoils very much less when smokeless powder is used. This is due to the  suddenness with which the pressure is exerted by smokeless powder, it  acting more like a very sharp blow on the metal, whereby more of the  energy is converted into heat instead of being spent in overcoming the  inertia of the barrel to give recoil. Similarly when smokeless powder is  fired in a gun, the displacement of the air is so sudden that the sound  waves do not possess the same amplitude of recoil or vibration as is  given by black powder.           *       *       *       *       *          THE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF UNDERGROUND CIRCUITS.    BY S.B. FOWLER.      The numerous disastrous storms of the last winter have brought out very  vividly the advantages of having all wires placed underground, and many  inquiries have been addressed to the companies operating underground  circuits as to their success. It is not probable that all of the answers  to these inquiries have been of the most favorable character. To many  central station managers an underground system means frequent  break-downs and interruptions of service, with, perhaps, slow and  expensive repairs, which bring in their turn numerous complaints, loss  of customers, and reduced profits. In many installations burn-outs both  underground and in the station are frequent, with the natural result  that the operating of circuits underground is not there considered an  unqualified success. The writer has in mind two very different  experiences with underground cables. Several miles of cable were bought  by a certain company, carefully laid, and up to to-day not a single  burn-out or interruption of service can be attributed to failure of  cables; at about the same time another company bought about an equal  amount of the same kind of cable, and in a comparatively short time the  current had to be shut off the lines and the whole installation repaired  and parts of it replaced. Both of these experiences have been repeated  many times and will be again, although it is simply a distinction  between a good cable properly laid and a good cable ruined by careless  and incompetent workmanship.    Every failure can be traced to poor work in the original installation or  to the use of a cheap cable, both causes being due, generally, to that  false economy which looks for too quick returns. A poorly insulated line  wire and a poorly insulated cable are two very different things.  However, it is a fact that by the use of a good cable it is not  difficult to construct an underground system for light, power, telegraph  or telephone uses that will be superior to overhead lines in its service  and in cost of maintenance. The ideal underground system must have as a  starting point a system of subways admitting of the easy drawing in and  out of cables and affording means of making subsidiary connections  readily and with the minimum of expense and interruption of service.  This is practically accomplished by a subway consisting of lines of pipe  terminating at convenient intervals, say at street intersections, in  manholes, for convenience in jointing and in running out house  connections. These pipes, or ducts, as they are called, should be for  two kinds of service; the lower or deeper laid lines for the main or  trunk circuits, and a second series of ducts laid nearer the surface,  running into service boxes placed near together for lines to \"house to  house\" connections. In some cities where it is allowed to run overhead  lines, the plan of running but one service connection in a block is  followed, all customers in the block being supplied from a line run over  the housetops or strung on the rear walls.    This makes unnecessary all subsidiary ducts except a short one from the  manhole to the nearest building in the block, and effects a considerable  saving in pipe, service boxes, cables and labor. The manholes should  have their walls built up of brick, the floors should be of concrete,  and there should be an inside lid which can be fastened down and the  manhole thus made water-tight.    For ducts wood, iron or cement lined pipe may be used. To preserve the  wood it is generally treated with creosote, which, in contact with the  lead cover of the cable, sets up a chemical action, resulting in the  destruction of the lead. Wood offers but little protection for the  cable, as it is too easily damaged and broken through in the frequent  street openings made by companies operating lines of pipe in the  streets, and as one of the main purposes of a subway is that of a  protection to cables, wooden ducts have little to recommend them except  their cheapness.    Iron pipes are either laid in trenches filled in with earth or are laid  in cement. Iron pipe will of course rust out in time, and if absolute  permanence in construction is desired, should be laid in cement, for  after the pipe rusts out, the duct of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#9)"],[1,"ivory and plumes, fine plaited willow ware, weapons of superior  workmanship. Justly can it be demanded 'What sort of civilization is this?  Whence does it come?'\"    It is also pointed out that one of the most important contributions to the  civilization of mankind was very probably made by the Negro race. This was  the invention of the smelting of iron. The facts brought forward to  support this view are: that no iron was smelted in Europe before 900 B.C.;  that about 3000 B.C., there began to appear on the Egyptian monuments  pictures of Africans bringing iron from the South to Egypt; that at a time  considerably later than this iron implements began to appear in Asia; that  there is no iron ore in Egypt; and that in Negro Africa iron ore is  abundant. In many places it is found on top of the ground and in some  parts it can be melted by simply placing a piece of ore in the fire very  much as you would a potato to be roasted.    Studies in the fields of ancient and medieval history are also showing  that in the past there were in Negro Africa civilizations of probable  indigenous origin which attained importance enough to be mentioned in the  writings of the historians and poets of those periods. The seat of one of  the highest of these civilizations was Ethiopia. Here the Negro nation  attained the greatest fame. As early as 2,500 years before the birth of  Christ the Ethiopians appeared to have had a considerable civilization. It  was well known to the writers of the Bible and is referred to therein some  forty-nine times. In Genesis we read of Cush, the eldest son of Ham. Cush  is the Hebrew word for black and means the same as Ethiopia. One of the  most famous sons of Cush was Nimrod, whom the Bible mentions as being \"a  mighty hunter before the Lord; whereof it is said, like Nimrod, a mighty  hunter before the Lord.\" The Bible refers to Ethiopia as being far distant  from Palestine. In the book of Isaiah we read \"the land of the rustling of  wings which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia that sendeth ambassadors by  the sea.\" The rivers of Ethiopia mentioned in Isaiah are the upper  tributaries of the Nile, the Atbara, the Blue Nile and the Sobat.    The later capital of Ethiopia was Meroe. Recent excavations have shown  Meroe to have been a city larger than Memphis. The Temple of Ammon, where  kings were crowned, was one of the largest in the valley of the Nile. The  great walls of cut stones were 15 feet thick and 30 feet high. Heaps of  iron-slag and furnaces for smelting iron were discovered, and there were  magnificent quays and landing places on the river side, for the export of  iron. Excavations have also shown that for 150 years Egypt was a dependency  of Ethiopia. The kings of the twenty-third and twenty-fourth Egyptian  dynasties were really governors appointed by Ethiopian overlords, while the  twenty-fifth dynasty was founded by the Ethiopian king, Sabako, in order to  check Assyrian aggression. Palestine was enabled to hold out against  Assyria by Ethiopian help. Sennacherib's attempt to capture Jerusalem and  carry the Jews into captivity, was frustrated by the army of the Ethiopian  king, Taharka. The nation and religion of Judah were thus preserved from  being absorbed in heathen lands like the lost Ten Tribes. The Negro  soldiers of the Sudan saved the Jewish religion.    The old Greek writers were well acquainted with Ethiopia. According to them  in the most ancient times there existed to the South of Egypt a nation and  a land designated as Ethiopia. This was the land where the people with the  sunburnt faces dwelt. The Greek poet, Homer, mentions the Ethiopians as  dwelling at the uttermost limits of the earth, where they enjoyed personal  intercourse with the gods. In one place Homer said that Neptune, the god of  the sea, \"had gone to feast with the Ethiopians who dwell afar off, the  Ethiopians who are divided into two parts, the most distant of men, some  at the setting of the sun, others at the rising.\" Herodotus, the Greek  historian, described the Ethiopians as long lived and their country as  extending to the Southern Sea.    The great fame of the Ethiopians is thus sketched by the eminent historian,  Heeren, who in his historical researches says: \"In the earliest traditions  of nearly all the more civilized nations of antiquity, the name of this  distant people is found. The annals of the Egyptian priests were full  of them; the nations of inner Asia, on the Euphrates and Tigris, have  interwoven the fictions of the Ethiopians with their own traditions of the  conquests and wars of their heroes; and, at a period equally remote, they  glimmer in Greek mythology. When the Greeks scarcely knew Italy and Sicily  by name, the Ethiopians were celebrated in the verses of their poets; they  spoke of them as the 'remotest nation,' the 'most just of men,' the  'favorites of the gods,' The lofty inhabitants of Olympus journey to them  and take part in their feasts; their sacrifices are the most agreeable  of all that mortals can offer them. And when the faint gleam of tradition  and fable gives way to the clear light of history, the luster of the  Ethiopians is not diminished. They still continue the object of curiosity  and admiration; and the pens of cautious, clear-sighted historians often  place them in the highest rank of knowledge and civilization.\"    Of these facts most modern historians know but little and Negroes in  general almost nothing. For example, how many have ever heard of Al-Bekri,  the Arab writer, who in the eleventh century wrote a description of the  Western Sudan of such importance that it gained him the title of \"The  Historian of Negro Land\"? How much, by means of research, might be learned  of the town of Ghana situate on the banks of the Niger, which the historian  Al-Bekri described as a meeting place for commercial caravans from all  parts of the world? This town, he said, contained schools and centers of  learning. It was the resort of the learned, the rich, and the pious of all  nations. Likewise, most of us have never heard perhaps of another Arab  writer, Iben Khaldun, who in writing about the middle of the fourteenth  century of Melle, another of the kingdoms of the Sudan, reported that  caravans from Egypt consisting of twelve thousand laden camels passed every  year through one town on the eastern border of the empire on their way to  the capital of the nation. The load of a camel was three hundred pounds.  12,000 camel loads amounted, therefore, to something like 1,600 tons of  merchandise. At this time we are told that there was probably not a ship in  any of the merchant navies of the world which could carry one hundred tons.  250 years later the average tonnage of the vessels of Spain was 300 tons  and that of the English much less. The largest ship which Queen Elizabeth  had in her navy, the _Great Mary_, had a capacity of a thousand tons; but  it was considered an exception and the marvel of the age.    Another thing that is not generally known is the importance to which some  of these Negro kingdoms of the Western Sudan attained during the middle  ages and the first centuries of the modern era. In size and permanency  they compared favorably with the most advanced nations of Europe. The  kingdom of Melle of which the historian, Iben Khaldun, wrote, had an area  of over 1,000 miles in extent and existed for 250 years. It was the first  of the kingdoms of the Western Sudan to be received on equal terms with  the contemporary white nations. The greatest of all the Sudan states was  the kingdom of Songhay which, in its golden age, had an area almost equal  to that of the United States and existed from about 750 A.D. to 1591.  There is a record of the kings of Songhay in regular succession for almost  900 years. The length of the life of the Songhay empire coincides almost  exactly with the life of Rome from its foundation as a republic to its  downfall as an empire.    The greatest evidences of the high state of civilization which the Sudan  had in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were the attention that was  paid to education and the unusual amount of learning that existed there.  The university of Sankore at Timbuctu was a very active center of learning.  It was in correspondence with the universities of North Africa and Egypt.  It was in touch with the universities of Spain. In the sixteenth century  Timbuctu had a large learned class living at ease and busily occupied with  the elucidation of intellectual and religious problems. The town swarmed  with students. Law, literature, grammar, theology and the natural sciences  were studied. The city of Melle had a regular school of science. One  distinguished geographer is mentioned, and allusions to surgical science  show that the old maxim of the Arabian schools, \"He who studies anatomy  pleases God,\" was not forgotten. One of these writers mentions that his  brother came from Jenne to Timbuctu to undergo an operation for cataract of  the eyes at the hands of a celebrated surgeon there. It is said that the  operation was wholly successful. The appearance of comets, so amazing to  Europe of the Middle Ages and at the present time to the ignorant, was by  these learned blacks noted calmly as a matter of scientific interest.  Earthquakes and eclipses excited no great surprise.    The renowned writer of the Sudan was Abdurrahman Essadi. He was born in  Timbuctu in 1596. He came of learned and distinguished ancestors. He is  chief author of the history of Sudan. The book is said to be a wonderful  document. The narrative deals mainly with the modern history of the  Songhay Empire, and relates the rise of this black civilization through  the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and its decadence up to the middle  of the seventeenth century. The noted traveller, Barth, was of the opinion  that the book forms one of the most important additions that the present  age has made to the history of"]]]
