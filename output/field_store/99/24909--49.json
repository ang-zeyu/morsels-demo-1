A sudden thought gave Grethel unusual strength; she started forward,  gave the old woman a push which sent her right into the oven, then she  shut the iron door and fastened the bolt.    Oh! how the old witch did howl, it was quite horrible to hear her. But  Grethel ran away, and therefore she was left to burn, just as she had  left many poor little children to burn. And how quickly Grethel ran to  Hansel, opened the door of his cage, and cried, \"Hansel, Hansel, we are  free; the old witch is dead.\" He flew like a bird out of his cage at  these words as soon as the door was opened, and the children were so  overjoyed that they ran into each other's arms, and kissed each other  with the greatest love.    And now that there was nothing to be afraid of, they went back into the  house, and while looking round the old witch's room, they saw an old oak  chest, which they opened, and found it full of pearls and precious  stones. \"These are better than pebbles,\" said Hansel; and he filled his  pockets as full as they would hold.    \"I will carry some home too,\" said Grethel, and she held out her apron,  which held quite as much as Hansel's pockets.    \"We will go now,\" he said, \"and get away as soon as we can from this  enchanted forest.\"    They had been walking for nearly two hours when they came to a large  sheet of water.    \"What shall we do now?\" said the boy. \"We cannot get across, and there  is no bridge of any sort.\"    \"Oh! here comes a boat,\" cried Grethel, but she was mistaken; it was  only a white duck which came swimming towards the children. \"Perhaps she  will help us across if we ask her,\" said the child; and she sung,  \"Little duck, do help poor Hansel and Grethel; there is not a bridge,  nor a boat--will you let us sail across on your white back?\"    The good-natured duck came near the bank as Grethel spoke, so close  indeed that Hansel could seat himself and wanted to take his little  sister on his lap, but she said, \"No, we shall be too heavy for the kind  duck; let her take us over one at a time.\"    The good creature did as the children wished; she carried Grethel over  first, and then came back for Hansel. And then how happy the children  were to find themselves in a part of the wood which they remembered  quite well, and as they walked on, the more familiar it became, till at  last they caught sight of their father's house. Then they began to run,  and, bursting into the room, threw themselves into their father's arms.    Poor man, he had not had a moment's peace since the children had been  left alone in the forest; he was full of joy at finding them safe and  well again, and now they had nothing to fear, for their wicked  stepmother was dead.    But how surprised the poor wood-cutter was when Grethel opened and shook  her little apron to see the glittering pearls and precious stones  scattered about the room, while Hansel drew handful after handful from  his pockets. From this moment all his care and sorrow was at an end, and  the father lived in happiness with his children till his death.          CHAPTER V    THE STORY OF ALADDIN; OR, THE WONDERFUL LAMP      In one of the large and rich cities of China, there once lived a tailor  named Mustapha. He was very poor. He could hardly, by his daily labour,  maintain himself and his family, which consisted only of his wife and a  son.    His son, who was called Aladdin, was a very careless and idle fellow. He  was disobedient to his father and mother, and would go out early in the  morning and stay out all day, playing in the streets and public places  with idle children of his own age.    When he was old enough to learn a trade, his father took him into his  own shop, and taught him how to use his needle; but all his father's  endeavours to keep him to his work were vain, for no sooner was his back  turned, than he was gone for that day, Mustapha chastised him, but  Aladdin was incorrigible, and his father, to his great grief, was forced  to abandon him to his idleness; and was so much troubled about him, that  he fell sick and died in a few months.    Aladdin, who was now no longer restrained by the fear of a father, gave  himself entirely over to his idle habits, and was never out of the  streets from his companions. This course he followed till he was fifteen  years old, without giving his mind to any useful pursuit, or the least  reflection on what would become of him. As he was one day playing,  according to custom, in the street, with his evil associates, a stranger  passing by stood to observe him.    This stranger was a sorcerer, known as the African magician, as he had  been but two days arrived from Africa, his native country.    The African magician, observing in Aladdin's countenance something which  assured him that he was a fit boy for his purpose, inquired his name and  history of some of his companions, and when he had learnt all he desired  to know, went up to him, and taking him aside from his comrades, said,  \"Child, was not your father called Mustapha the tailor?\" \"Yes, sir,\"  answered the boy, \"but he has been dead a long time.\"    At these words the African magician threw his arms about Aladdin's neck,  and kissed him several times, with tears in his eyes, and said, \"I am  your uncle. Your worthy father was my own brother. I knew you at first  sight, you are so like him.\" Then he gave Aladdin a handful of small  money, saying, \"Go, my son, to your mother, give my love to her, and  tell her that I will visit her to-morrow, that I may see where my good  brother lived so long, and ended his days.\"    Aladdin ran to his mother, overjoyed at the money his uncle had given  him. \"Mother,\" said he, \"have I an uncle?\" \"No, child,\" replied his  mother, \"you have no uncle by your father's side or mine.\" \"I am just  now come,\" said Aladdin, \"from a man who says he is my uncle and my  father's brother. He cried and kissed me when I told him my father was  dead, and gave me money, sending his love to you, and promising to come  and pay you a visit, that he may see the house my father lived and died  in.\" \"Indeed, child,\" replied the mother, \"your father had no brother,  nor have you an uncle.\"    The next day the magician found Aladdin playing in another part of the  town, and embracing him as before, put two pieces of gold into his hand,  and said to him, \"Carry this, child, to your mother; tell her that I  will come and see her to-night, and bid her get us something for supper;  but first show ms the house where you live.\"    Aladdin showed the African magician the house, and carried the two  pieces of gold to his mother, who went out and bought provisions; and  considering she wanted various utensils, borrowed them of her  neighbours. She spent the whole day in preparing the supper; and at  night, when it was ready, said to her son, \"Perhaps the stranger knows  not how to find our house; go and bring him, if you meet with him.\"    Aladdin was just ready to go, when the magician knocked at the door, and  came in loaded with wine and all sorts of fruits, which he brought for a  dessert. After he had given what he brought into Aladdin's hands, he  saluted his mother, and desired her to show him the place where his  brother Mustapha used to sit on the sofa; and when she had so done, he  fell down and kissed it several times, crying out, with tears in his  eyes, \"My poor brother! how unhappy am I, not to have come soon enough  to give you one last embrace.\" Aladdin's mother desired him to sit down  in the same place, but he declined. \"No,\" said he, \"I shall not do that;  but give me leave to sit opposite to it, that although I see not the  master of a family so dear to me, I may at least behold the place where  he used to sit.\"    When the magician had made choice of a place, and sat down, he began to  enter into discourse with Aladdin's mother. \"My good sister,\" said he,  \"do not be surprised at your never having seen me all the time you have  been married to my brother Mustapha of happy memory. I have been forty  years absent from this country, which is my native place, as well as my  late brother's; and during that time have travelled into the Indies,  Persia, Arabia, Syria, and Egypt, and afterward crossed over into  Africa, where I took up my abode. At last, as it is natural for a man, I  was desirous to see my native country again, and to embrace my dear  brother; and finding I had strength enough to undertake so long a  journey, I made the necessary preparations, and set out. Nothing ever  afflicted me so much as hearing of my brother's death. But God be  praised for all things! It is a comfort for me to find, as it were, my  brother in a son, who has his most remarkable features.\"    The African magician perceiving that the widow wept at the remembrance  of her husband, changed the conversation, and turning toward her son,  asked him, \"What business do you follow? Are you of any trade?\"    At this question the youth hung down his head, and was not a little  abashed when his mother answered \"Aladdin is an idle fellow. His father,  when alive, strove all he could to teach him his trade, but could not  succeed; and since his death, notwithstanding all I can say to him, he  does nothing but idle away his time in the streets, as you saw him,  without considering he is no longer a child; and if you do not make him  ashamed of it, I despair of his ever coming to any good. For my part, I  am resolved, one of these days, to turn him out of doors, and let him  provide for himself.\"    After these words, Aladdin's mother burst into tears; and the magician  said, \"This is not well, nephew; you must think of helping yourself, and  getting your livelihood. There are many sorts of trades; perhaps you do  not like your father's, and would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"Noah cursed the raven thus: \"May thy  mouth, which has spoken evil against me, be accursed, and thy  intercourse with thy wife be only through it.\"[177] All the  animals in the ark said Amen. And this is the reason why a mass  of spittle runs from the mouth of the male raven into the mouth  of the female during the act of copulation, and only thus the  female is impregnated.[178] Altogether the raven is an  unattractive animal. He is unkind toward his own young so long as  their bodies are not covered with black feathers,[179] though as  a rule ravens love one another.[180] God therefore takes the  young ravens under His special protection. From their own  excrement maggots come forth,[181] which serve as their food  during the three days that elapse after their birth, until their  white feathers turn black and their parents recognize them as  their offspring and care for them.[182]    The raven has himself to blame also for the awkward hop in his  gait. He observed the graceful step of the dove, and envious of  her tried to enmulate it. The outcome was that he almost broke  his bones without in the least succeeding in making himself  resemble the dove, not to mention that he brought the scorn of  the other animals down upon himself. His failure excited their  ridicule. Then he decided to return to his own original gait, but  in the interval he had unlearnt it, and he could walk neither the  one way nor the other properly. His step had become a hop betwixt  and between. Thus we see how true it is, that he who is  dissatisfied with his small portion loses the little he has in  striving for more and better things.[163]    The steer is also one of the animals that have suffered a change  in the course of time. Originally his face was entirely overgrown  with hair, but now there is none on his nose, and that is because  Joshua kissed him on his nose during the siege of Jericho. Joshua  was an exceedingly heavy man. Horses, donkeys, and mules, none  could bear him, they all broke down under his weight. What they  could not do, the steer accomplished. On his back Joshua rode to  the siege of Jericho, and in gratitude he bestowed a kiss upon  his nose.[134]    The serpent, too, is other than it was at first. Before the fall  of man it was the cleverest of all animals created, and in form  it resembled man closely. It stood upright, and was of  extraordinary size.[185] Afterward, it lost the mental advantages  it had possessed as compared with other animals, and it  degenerated physically, too; it was deprived of its feet, so that  it could not pursue other animals and kill them. The mole and the  frog had to be made harmless in similar ways; the former has no  eyes, else it were irresistible, and the frog has no teeth, else  no animal in the water were sure of its life.[186]    While the cunning of the serpent wrought its own undoing, the  cunning of the fox stood him in good stead in many an  embarrassing situation. After Adam had committed the sin of  disobedience, God delivered the whole of the animal world into  the power of the Angel of Death, and He ordered him to cast one  pair of each kind into the water. He and leviathan together thus  have dominion over all that has life. When the Angel of Death was  in the act of executing the Divine command upon the fox, he began  to weep bitterly. The Angel of Death asked him the reason of his  tears, and the fox replied that he was mourning the sad fate of  his friend. At the same time he pointed to the figure of a fox in  the sea, which was nothing but his own reflection. The Angel of  Death, persuaded that a representative of the fox family had been  cast into the water, let him go free. The fox told his trick to  the cat, and she in turn played it on the Angel of Death.[187] So  it happened that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the  water, while all other animals are.[188]    When leviathan passed the animals in review, and missing the fox  was informed of the sly way in which he had eluded his authority,  he dispatched great and powerful fish on the errand of enticing  the truant into the water. The fox walking along the shore espied  the large number of fish, and he exclaimed, \"How happy he who may  always satisfy his hunger with the flesh of such as these.\" The  fish told him, if he would but follow them, his appetite could  easily be appeased. At the same time they informed him that a  great honor awaited him. Leviathan, they said, was at death's  door, and he had commissioned them to install the fox as his  successor. They were ready to carry him on their backs, so that  he had no need to fear the water, and thus they would convey him  to the throne, which stood upon a huge rock. The fox yielded to  these persuasions, and descended into the water. Presently an  uncomfortable feeling took possession of him. He began to suspect  that the tables were turned; he was being made game of instead of  making game of others as usual. He urged the fish to tell him the  truth, and they admitted that they had been sent out to secure  his person for leviathan, who wanted his heart,[189] that he  might become as knowing as the fox, whose wisdom he had heard  many extol. The fox said reproachfully: \"Why did you not tell me  the truth at once? Then I could have brought my heart along with  me for King Leviathan, who would have showered honors upon me. As  it is, you will surely suffer punishment for bringing me without  my heart. The foxes, you see,\" he continued, \"do not carry their  hearts around with them. They keep them in a safe place, and when  they have need of them, they fetch them thence.\" The fish quickly  swam to shore, and landed the fox, so that he might go for his  heart. No sooner did he feel dry land under his feet than he  began to jump and shout, and when they urged him to go in search  of his heart, and follow them, he said: \"O ye fools, could I have  followed you into the water, if I had not had my heart with me?  Or exists there a creature able to go abroad without his heart?\"  The fish replied: \"Come, come, thou art fooling us.\" Whereupon  the fox: \"O ye fools, if I could play a trick on the Angel of  Death, how much easier was it to make game of you?\" So they had  to return, their errand undone, and leviathan could not but  confirm the taunting judgment of the fox: \"In very truth, the fox  is wise of heart, and ye are fools.\"[190]      ALL THINGS PRAISE THE LORD    \"Whatever God created has value.\" Even the animals and the  insects that seem useless and noxious at first sight have a  vocation to fulfil. The snail trailing a moist streak after it as  it crawls, and so using up its vitality, serves as a remedy for  boils. The sting of a hornet is healed by the house-fly crushed  and applied to the wound. The gnat, feeble creature, taking in  food but never secreting it, is a specific against the poison of  a viper, and this venomous reptile itself cures eruptions, while  the lizard is the antidote to the scorpion.[191] Not only do all  creatures serve man, and contribute to his comfort, but also God  \"teacheth us through the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wise  through the fowls of heaven.\" He endowed many animals with  admirable moral qualities as a pattern for man. If the Torah had  not been revealed to us, we might have learnt regard for the  decencies of life from the cat, who covers her excrement with  earth; regard for the property of others from the ants, who never  encroach upon one another's stores; and regard for decorous  conduct from the cock, who, when he desires to unite with the  hen, promises to buy her a cloak long enough to reach to the  ground, and when the hen reminds him of his promise, he shakes  his comb and says, \"May I be deprived of my comb, if I do not buy  it when I have the means.\" The grasshopper also has a lesson to  teach to man. All the summer through it sings, until its belly  bursts, and death claims it. Though it knows the fate that awaits  it, yet it sings on. So man should do his duty toward God, no  matter what the consequences. The stork should be taken as a  model in two respects. He guards the purity of his family life  zealously, and toward his fellows he is compassionate and  merciful. Even the frog can be the teacher of man. By the side of  the water there lives a species of animals which subsist off  aquatic creatures alone. When the frog notices that one of them  is hungry, he goes to it of his own accord, and offers himself as  food, thus fulfilling the injunction, \"If thine enemy be hungry,  give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to  drink.\"[192]    The whole of creation was called into existence by God unto His  glory,[193] and each creature has its own hymn of praise  wherewith to extol the Creator. Heaven and earth, Paradise and  hell, desert and field, rivers and seas--all have their own way  of paying homage to God. The hymn of the earth is, \"From the  uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, glory to the  Righteous.\" The sea exclaims, \"Above the voices of many waters,  the mighty breakers of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty.\"    Also the celestial bodies and the elements proclaim the praise of  their Creator--the sun, moon, and stars, the clouds and the  winds, lightning and dew. The sun says, \"The sun and moon stood  still in their habitation, at the light of Thine arrows as they  went, at the shining of Thy glittering spear\"; and the stars  sing, \"Thou art the Lord, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven,  the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all  things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and  Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth  Thee.\"    Every plant, furthermore, has a song of praise. The fruitful tree  sings, \"Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy, before  the Lord, for He cometh; for He cometh to judge the earth\"; and  the ears of grain on the field sing, \"The pastures "]]]
