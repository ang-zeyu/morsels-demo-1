They were astonished at the sight of  the elegant books printed rapidly upon a pliant, silky paper by means of  wooden blocks. The first edition of the classical works printed in China  appeared in 958, five hundred years before the invention of Gutenberg. The  missionaries had, doubtless, often been busied in their convents with the  laborious work of copying manuscript books, and the simple Chinese method  of printing must have particularly attracted their attention. Many other  marvellous productions were noticed, such as silk, porcelain,  playing-cards, spectacles, and other products of art and industry unknown  in Europe. They brought back these new ideas to Europe; 'and from that  time,' says Abel Remusat, 'the West began to hold in due esteem the most  beautiful, the most populous, and the most anciently civilized of all the  four quarters of the world. The arts, the religious faith, and the  languages of its people were studied, and it was even proposed to  establish a professorship for the Tartar language in the University of  Paris. The world seemed to open towards the East; geography made immense  strides, and ardor for discovery opened a new vent for the adventurous  spirit of the Europeans. As our own hemisphere became better known, the  idea of another ceased to appear a wholly improbable paradox; and in  seeking the Zipangon of Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus discovered the  New World.'\"    The first aspect of China produces that impression on the mind which we  call the grotesque. This is merely because the customs of this singular  nation are so opposite to our own. They seem morally, no less than  physically, our antipodes. Their habits are as opposite to ours as the  direction of their bodies. We stand feet to feet in everything. In boxing  the compass they say \"westnorth\" instead of northwest, \"eastsouth\" instead  of southeast, and their compass-needle points south instead of north.  Their soldiers wear quilted petticoats, satin boots, and bead necklaces,  carry umbrellas and fans, and go to a night attack with lanterns in their  hands, being more afraid of the dark than of exposing themselves to the  enemy. The people are very fond of fireworks, but prefer to have them in  the daytime. Ladies' ride in wheelbarrows, and cows are driven in  carriages. While in Europe the feet are put in the stocks, in China the  stocks are hung round the neck. In China the family name comes first, and  the personal name afterward. Instead of saying Benjamin Franklin or Walter  Scott they would say Franklin Benjamin, Scott Walter. Thus the Chinese  name of Confucius, Kung-fu-tsee, means the Holy Master Kung;--Kung is the  family name. In the recent wars with the English the mandarins or soldiers  would sometimes run away, and then commit suicide to avoid punishment. In  getting on a horse, the Chinese mount on the right side. Their old men fly  kites, while the little boys look on. The left hand is the seat of honor,  and to keep on your hat is a sign of respect. Visiting cards are painted  red, and are four feet long. In the opinion of the Chinese, the seat of  the understanding is the stomach. They have villages which contain a  million of inhabitants. Their boats are drawn by men, but their carriages  are moved by sails. A married woman while young and pretty is a slave, but  when she becomes old and withered is the most powerful, respected, and  beloved person in the family. The emperor is regarded with the most  profound reverence, but the empress mother is a greater person than he.  When a man furnishes his house, instead of laying stress, as we do, on  rosewood pianos and carved mahogany, his first ambition is for a handsome  camphor-wood coffin, which he keeps in the best place in his room. The  interest of money is thirty-six per cent, which, to be sure, we also give  in hard times to stave off a stoppage, while with them it is the legal  rate. We once heard a bad dinner described thus: \"The meat was cold, the  wine was hot, and everything was sour but the vinegar.\" This would not so  much displease the Chinese, who carefully warm their wine, while we ice  ours. They understand good living, however, very well, are great epicures,  and somewhat gourmands, for, after dining on thirty dishes, they will  sometimes eat a duck by way of a finish. They toss their meat into their  mouths to a tune, every man keeping time with his chop-sticks, while we,  on the contrary, make anything but harmony with the clatter of our knives  and forks. A Chinaman will not drink a drop of milk, but he will devour  birds'-nests, snails, and the fins of sharks with a great relish. Our  mourning color is black and theirs is white; they mourn for their parents  three years, we a much shorter time. The principal room in their houses is  called \"the hall of ancestors,\" the pictures or tablets of whom, set up  against the wall, are worshipped by them; we, on the other hand, are only  too apt to send our grandfather's portrait to the garret.[10]        Sec. 2. Chinese Government based on Education. Civil-Service Examinations.      Such are a few of the external differences between the Chinese customs and  ours. But the most essential peculiarity of this nation is the high value  which they attribute to knowledge, and the distinctions and rewards which  they bestow on scholarship. All the civil offices in the Empire are given  as rewards of literary merit. The government, indeed, is called a complete  despotism, and the emperor is said to have absolute authority. He is not  bound by any written constitution, indeed; but the public opinion of the  land holds him, nevertheless, to a strict responsibility. He, no less than  his people, is bound by a law higher than that of any private will,--the  authority of custom. For, in China, more than anywhere else, \"what is gray  with age becomes religion.\" The authority of the emperor is simply  authority to govern according to the ancient usages of the country, and  whenever these are persistently violated, a revolution takes place and the  dynasty is changed. But a revolution in China changes nothing but the  person of the monarch; the unwritten constitution of old usages remains in  full force. \"A principle as old as the monarchy,\" says Du Halde, \"is this,  that the state is a large family, and the emperor is in the place of both  father and mother. He must govern his people with affection and goodness;  he must attend to the smallest matters which concern their happiness. When  he is not supposed to have this sentiment, he soon loses his hold on the  reverence of the people, and his throne becomes insecure.\" The emperor,  therefore, is always studying how to preserve this reputation. When a  province is afflicted by famine, inundation, or any other calamity, he  shuts himself in his palace, fasts, and publishes decrees to relieve it of  taxes and afford it aid.    The true power of the government is in the literary class. The government,  though nominally a monarchy, is really an aristocracy. But it is not an  aristocracy of birth, like that of England, for the humblest man's son can  obtain a place in it; neither is it an aristocracy of wealth, like ours  in the United States, nor a military aristocracy, like that of Russia, nor  an aristocracy of priests, like that of ancient Egypt, and of some modern  countries,--as, for instance, that of Paraguay under the Jesuits, or that  of the Sandwich Islands under the Protestant missionaries; but it is a  literary aristocracy.    The civil officers in China are called mandarins. They are chosen from the  three degrees of learned men, who may be called the bachelors,  licentiates, and doctors. All persons may be candidates for the first  degree, except three excluded classes,--boatmen, barbers, and actors. The  candidates are examined by the governors of their own towns. Of those  approved, a few are selected after another examination. These again are  examined by an officer who makes a circuit once in three years for that  purpose. They are placed alone in little rooms or closets, with pencils,  ink, and paper, and a subject is given them to write upon. Out of some  four hundred candidates fifteen may be selected, who receive the lowest  degree. There is another triennial examination for the second degree, at  which a small number of the bachelors are promoted. The examination for  the highest degree, that of doctor, is held at Pekin only, when some three  hundred are taken out of five thousand. These are capable of receiving the  highest offices. Whenever a vacancy occurs, one of those who have received  a degree is taken by lot from the few senior names. But a few years since,  there were five thousand of the highest rank, and twenty-seven thousand of  the second rank, who had not received employment.    The subjects upon which the candidates are examined, and the methods of  these examinations, are thus described in the Shanghae Almanac (1852).[11]    The examinations for the degree of Keujin (or licentiate) takes place at  the principal city of each province once in three years. The average  number of bachelors in the large province of Keang-Nan (which contains  seventy millions of inhabitants) is twenty thousand, out of whom only  about two hundred succeed. Sixty-five mandarins are deputed for this  examination, besides subordinate officials. The two chief examiners are  sent from Pekin. When the candidates enter the examination hall they are  searched for books or manuscripts, which might assist them in writing  their essays. This precaution is not superfluous, for many plans have been  invented to enable mediocre people to pass. Sometimes a thin book, printed  on very small type from copperplates, is slipped into a hole in the sole  of the shoe. But persons detected in such practices are ruined for life.  In a list of one hundred and forty-four successful candidates,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"ernment, it is evidently our  wisdom to keep all the constitutional checks on misgovernment in the  highest state of efficiency, to watch with jealousy the first beginnings  of encroachment, and never to suffer irregularities, even when harmless  in themselves, to pass unchallenged, lest they acquire the force of  precedents. Four hundred years ago such minute vigilance might well seem  unnecessary. A nation of hardy archers and spearmen might, with small  risk to its liberties, connive at some illegal acts on the part of a  prince whose general administration was good, and whose throne was not  defended by a single company of regular soldiers.    Under this system, rude as it may appear when compared with those  elaborate constitutions of which the last seventy years have been  fruitful, the English long enjoyed a large measure of freedom and  happiness. Though, during the feeble reign of Henry the Sixth, the state  was torn, first by factions, and at length by civil war; though Edward  the Fourth was a prince of dissolute and imperious character; though  Richard the Third has generally been represented as a monster of  depravity; though the exactions of Henry the Seventh caused great  repining; it is certain that our ancestors, under those Kings, were far  better governed than the Belgians under Philip, surnamed the Good, or  the French under that Lewis who was styled the Father of his people.  Even while the wars of the Roses were actually raging, our country  appears to have been in a happier condition than the neighbouring realms  during years of profound peace. Comines was one of the most enlightened  statesmen of his time. He had seen all the richest and most highly  civilised parts of the Continent. He had lived in the opulent towns of  Flanders, the Manchesters and Liverpools of the fifteenth century. He  had visited Florence, recently adorned by the magnificence of Lorenzo,  and Venice, not yet bumbled by the Confederates of Cambray. This eminent  man deliberately pronounced England to be the best governed country of  which he had any knowledge. Her constitution he emphatically designated  as a just and holy thing, which, while it protected the people, really  strengthened the hands of a prince who respected it. In no other country  were men so effectually secured from wrong. The calamities produced by  our intestine wars seemed to him to be confined to the nobles and the  fighting men, and to leave no traces such as he had been accustomed to  see elsewhere, no ruined dwellings, no depopulated cities.    It was not only by the efficiency of the restraints imposed on the royal  prerogative that England was advantageously distinguished from most of  the neighbouring countries. A: peculiarity equally important, though  less noticed, was the relation in which the nobility stood here to the  commonalty. There was a strong hereditary aristocracy: but it was of all  hereditary aristocracies the least insolent and exclusive. It had none  of the invidious character of a caste. It was constantly receiving  members from the people, and constantly sending down members to mingle  with the people. Any gentleman might become a peer. The younger son of a  peer was but a gentleman. Grandsons of peers yielded precedence to newly  made knights. The dignity of knighthood was not beyond the reach of  any man who could by diligence and thrift realise a good estate, or  who could attract notice by his valour in a battle or a siege. It was  regarded as no disparagement for the daughter of a Duke, nay of a royal  Duke, to espouse a distinguished commoner. Thus, Sir John Howard married  the daughter of Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk. Sir Richard Pole married  the Countess of Salisbury, daughter of George, Duke of Clarence. Good  blood was indeed held in high respect: but between good blood and the  privileges of peerage there was, most fortunately for our country, no  necessary connection. Pedigrees as long, and scutcheons as old, were to  be found out of the House of Lords as in it. There were new men who bore  the highest titles. There were untitled men well known to be descended  from knights who had broken the Saxon ranks at Hastings, and scaled the  walls of Jerusalem. There were Bohuns, Mowbrays, DeVeres, nay, kinsmen  of the House of Plantagenet, with no higher addition than that of  Esquire, and with no civil privileges beyond those enjoyed by every  farmer and shopkeeper. There was therefore here no line like that which  in some other countries divided the patrician from the plebeian. The  yeoman was not inclined to murmur at dignities to which his own children  might rise. The grandee was not inclined to insult a class into which  his own children must descend.    After the wars of York and Lancaster, the links which connected the  nobility and commonalty became closer and more numerous than ever. The  extent of destruction which had fallen on the old aristocracy may be  inferred from a single circumstance. In the year 1451 Henry the Sixth  summoned fifty-three temporal Lords to parliament. The temporal Lords  summoned by Henry the Seventh to the parliament of 1485 were only  twenty-nine, and of these several had recently been elevated to the  peerage. During the following century the ranks of the nobility were  largely recruited from among the gentry. The constitution of the House  of Commons tended greatly to promote the salutary intermixture of  classes. The knight of the shire was the connecting link between  the baron and the shopkeeper. On the same benches on which sate the  goldsmiths, drapers, and grocers, who had been returned to parliament by  the commercial towns, sate also members who, in any other country, would  have been called noblemen, hereditary lords of manors, entitled to hold  courts and to bear coat armour, and able to trace back an honourable  descent through many generations. Some of them were younger sons and  brothers of lords. Others could boast of even royal blood. At length the  eldest son of an Earl of Bedford, called in courtesy by the second title  of his father, offered himself as candidate for a seat in the House of  Commons, and his example was followed by others. Seated in that house,  the heirs of the great peers naturally became as zealous for its  privileges as any of the humble burgesses with whom they were mingled.  Thus our democracy was, from an early period, the most aristocratic, and  our aristocracy the most democratic in the world; a peculiarity  which has lasted down to the present day, and which has produced many  important moral and political effects.    The government of Henry the Seventh, of his son, and of his  grandchildren was, on the whole, more arbitrary than that of the  Plantagenets. Personal character may in some degree explain the  difference; for courage and force of will were common to all the men and  women of the House of Tudor. They exercised their power during a period  of a hundred and twenty years, always with vigour, often with violence,  sometimes with cruelty. They, in imitation of the dynasty which  had preceded them, occasionally invaded the rights of the subject,  occasionally exacted taxes under the name of loans and gifts, and  occasionally dispensed with penal statutes: nay, though they never  presumed to enact any permanent law by their own authority, they  occasionally took upon themselves, when Parliament was not sitting,  to meet temporary exigencies by temporary edicts. It was, however,  impossible for the Tudors to carry oppression beyond a certain point:  for they had no armed force, and they were surrounded by an armed  people. Their palace was guarded by a few domestics, whom the array of  a single shire, or of a single ward of London, could with ease have  overpowered. These haughty princes were therefore under a restraint  stronger than any that mere law can impose, under a restraint which did  not, indeed, prevent them from sometimes treating an individual in an  arbitrary and even in a barbarous manner, but which effectually secured  the nation against general and long continued oppression. They might  safely be tyrants, within the precinct of the court: but it was  necessary for them to watch with constant anxiety the temper of the  country. Henry the Eighth, for example, encountered no opposition when  he wished to send Buckingham and Surrey, Anne Boleyn and Lady Salisbury,  to the scaffold. But when, without the consent of Parliament, he  demanded of his subjects a contribution amounting to one sixth of their  goods, he soon found it necessary to retract. The cry of hundreds of  thousands was that they were English and not French, freemen and not  slaves. In Kent the royal commissioners fled for their lives. In Suffolk  four thousand men appeared in arms. The King's lieutenants in that  county vainly exerted themselves to raise an army. Those who did not  join in the insurrection declared that they would not fight against  their brethren in such a quarrel. Henry, proud and selfwilled as he was,  shrank, not without reason from a conflict with the roused spirit of  the nation. He had before his eyes the fate of his predecessors who  had perished at Berkeley and Pomfret. He not only cancelled his  illegal commissions; he not only granted a general pardon to all the  malecontents; but he publicly and solemnly apologised for his infraction  of the laws.    His conduct, on this occasion, well illustrates the whole policy of his  house. The temper of the princes of that line was hot, and their  spirits high, but they understood the character of the nation that they  governed, and never once, like some of their predecessors, and some of  their successors, carried obstinacy to a fatal point. The discretion of  the Tudors was such, that their power, though it was often resisted,  was never subverted. The reign of every one of them was disturbed by  formidable discontents: but the government was always able either to  soothe the"]]]
