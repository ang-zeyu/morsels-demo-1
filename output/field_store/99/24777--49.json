The gear wheels are, as shown, efficiently guarded,  and provision is made to start or stop the machine from any position  on both sides. The machine is adapted for building 10 in. X 5 in.  bobbins, i.e. 10 in. between the flanges and 5 in. outside diameter,  and provided with either 56 or 64 spindles, the illustration showing  part of a machine and approximately 48 spindles.    The machines for rove (roving frames) are designated by the size of  the bobbin upon which the rove is wound, e.g. 10 in. x 5 in. frame,  and so on; this means that the flanges of the bobbin are 10 in.  apart and 5 in. in diameter, and hence the traverse of the builder  would be 10 in. The 10 in. x 5 in. bobbin is the standard size for  the ordinary run of yarns, but 9 in. x 4-1/2 in. bobbins are  used for the roves from which finer yarns are spun. When the  finished yarn appears in the form of rove (often termed spinning  direct), as is the case for heavier sizes or thick yarns, 8 in. x 4  in. bobbins are largely used.    Provision is made on each roving frame for changing the size of rove  so as to accommodate it for the subsequent process of spinning and  according to the count of the required yarn; the parts involved in  these changes are those which affect the draft gearing, the twist  gearing, and the builder gearing in conjunction with the automatic  index wheel which acts on the whole of the regulating motion.          CHAPTER X.  SPINNING    The final machine used in the conversion of rove to the size of yarn  required is termed the spinning frame. The actual process of  spinning is performed in this machine, and, although the whole  routine of the conversion of fibre into yarn often goes under the  name of spinning, it is obvious that a considerable number of  processes are involved, and an immense amount of work has to be done  before the actual process of spinning is attempted. The nomenclature  is due to custom dating back to prehistoric times when the  conversion of fibre to yarn was conducted by much simpler apparatus  than it is at present; the established name to denote this  conversion of fibre to yarn now refers only to one of a large number  of important processes, each one of which is as important and  necessary as the actual operation of spinning.    A photographical reproduction of a large spinning flat in one of the  Indian jute mills appears in Fig. 20, showing particularly the wide  \"pass\" between two long rows of spinning frames, and the method  adopted of driving all the frames from a long line shaft. Spinning  frames are usually double-sided, and each side may contain any  practicable number of spindles; 64 to 80 spindles per side are  common numbers.    [Illustration: FIG 20. AN INDIAN SPINNING FLAT]    The rove bobbins, several of which are clearly seen in Fig. 20, are  brought from the roving frame and placed on the iron pegs of a creel  (often called a hake) near the top of the spinning frame-actually  above all moving parts of the machine. Each rove bobbin is free to  rotate on its own peg as the rove from it is drawn downwards by the  retaining rollers. The final drafting of the material takes place in  this frame, and a considerable amount of twist is imparted to the  drawn out material; the latter, now in the desired form and size of  yarn, is wound simultaneously on to a suitable size and form of  spinning bobbin.    When the rove emerges from the retaining rollers it is passed over a  \"breast-plate,\" and then is entered into the wide part of the  conductor; it then leaves by the narrow part of the conductor by  means of which part the rove is guided to the nip of the drawing  rollers, The rove is, of course, drafted or drawn out between the  retaining and drawing rollers according to the draft required, and  the fibrous material, now in thread size is placed in a slot of the  \"thread-plate,\" then round the top of the flyer, round one of the  arms of the flyer, through the eye or palm at the end of the flyer  arm and on to the spinning bobbin. The latter is raised and lowered  as in the roving frame by a builder motion, so that the yarn may be  distributed over the full range between the ends or flanges.    Each spindle is driven separately by means of a tape or band which  passes partially round the driving cylinder and the driven whorl of  the spindle, and a constant relation obtains between the delivery of  the yarn and the speed of the spindle during the operation of  spinning any fixed count or type of yarn. In this connection, the  parts resemble those in the roving frame, but from this point the  functions of the two frames differ. The yarn has certainly to be  wound upon the bobbin and at the same rate as it is delivered from  the drawing or delivery rollers, but in the spinning frame the bobbin,  which rotates on the spindle, is not driven positively, as in the  roving frame, by wheel gearing; each spinning bobbin is actually  driven by the yarn being pulled round by the arm of the flyer and  just sufficient resistance is offered by the pressure or tension of  the \"temper band\" and weight. The temper band is simply a piece of  leather or hemp twine to which is attached a weight, and the other  end of the leather or twine is attached to the builder rail.    [Illustration: FIG. 21 A LINE OF SPINNING FRAMES]    The front part of the builder rail is provided with grooves into one  of which the temper-band is placed so that the band itself is in  contact with a groove near the base of the bobbin flange. A varying  amount of resistance or tension on the bobbin is required in virtue  of the varying size of the partially-filled bobbin, and this is  obtained by placing the temper-band successively in different groves  in the builder so that it will embrace a gradually increasing arc of  the spinning bobbin, and thus impart a heavier drag or tension.    The spinning frames in Fig. 20 are arranged with the ends of the  frame parallel to the pass, whereas the end frames in Fig. 21 are at  right angles to the pass, and hence an excellent view of the chief  parts is presented. The full rove bobbins are seen distinctly on the  pegs of the creel in the upper part of the figure, and the rove  yarns from these bobbins pass downwards, as already described, until  they ultimately enter the eyes of the flyer arms to be directed to  and wound upon the spinning bobbins. The flyers--at one time termed  throstles--are clearly visible a little above the row of temper  weights. The chief parts for raising the builder--cam lever,  adjustable rod, chain and wheel--are illustrated at the end of the  frame nearest the observer.          CHAPTER XI.  TWISTING AND REELING    In regard to cloth manufacture, most yarns are utilized in the form  they leave the spinning frame, that is, as single yarns. On the  other hand, for certain branches of the trade, weaving included, it  is necessary to take two, three, or more of these single yarns and to  combine them by a process technically termed twisting, and sometimes  \"doubling\" when two single yarns only are combined.    Although the commonest method, so far as weaving requirements go, is  to twist two single yarns together to make a compound yarn, it is  not uncommon to combine a much higher number, indeed, sixteen or  more single yarns are often united for special purposes, but, when  this number is exceeded, the operation comes under the heading of  twines, ropes and the like. The twist or twine thus formed will have  the number of yarns regulated by the levelness and strength required  for the finished product. The same operation is conducted in the  making of strands for cordage, but when a number of these twines are  laid-up or twisted together, the name cord or rope is used to  distinguish them.[1]    [Footnote 1: See _Cordage and Cordage Hemp and Fibres_, by T.  Woodhouse and P. Kilgour.]    When two or three threads are united by twisting, the operation can  be conducted in a twisting frame which differs little from a  ordinary spinning frame, and hence need not be described. There may  be, however, appliances embodying some system of automatic stop  motion to bring the individual spindles to rest if one thread out of  any group which are being combined happens to break. When several  threads have to be twisted together, special types of twisting  frames are employed; these special machines are termed \"tube twisters,\"  and the individual threads pass through holes suitably placed in a  plate or disc before they reach the tube.    More or less elaborate methods of combining yarns are occasionally  adopted, but the reader is advised to consult the above-mentioned  work on Cordage and similar literature for detailed information.    When the yarn leaves the spinning frame, or the twisting frame, it  is made up according to requirements, and the general operations  which follow spinning and twisting are,--reeling, cop-winding, roll  or spool winding, mill warping or link warping. The type or class of  yarn, the purpose for which the yarn is to be used, or the equipment  of the manufacturer, determines which of these methods should be  used previous to despatching the yarn.    _Reeling_. Reeling is a comparatively simple operation, consisting  solely of winding the yarns from the spinning or twisting bobbins on  to a wide swift or reel of a suitable width and of a fixed diameter,  or rather circumference. Indeed, the circumference of the reel was  fixed by an Act of Convention of Estates, dating as far back as 1665  and as under:    \"That no linen yarn be exported under the pain of confiscation, half  to the King and half to the attacher.\"    \"That linen yarn be sold by weight and that no reel be shorter than  _ten quarters_.\"    The same size of reel has been adopted for all jute yarns.

I watched both day and night; I could not sleep      Like my well-tented comrades far behind,    Though near enough to let their snoring keep      A friend awake, if e'er to doze inclined.

Asgod and Ailrik, two of his monks,      On the mission drear he sped    To search for the corse on the battle-plain      Among the bloody dead.      The monks arose and went sadly forth,      And returned as heavy-hearted.    \"O Father, the world's a bitter world,      And evil days have started.      \"For fallen, alack! is the better man;      The Bastard has won, and knaves    And scutcheoned thieves divide the land,      And make the freemen slaves.      \"The veriest rascals from Normandy,      In Britain are lords and sirs.    I saw a tailor from Bayeux ride      With a pair of golden spurs.      \"O woe to all who are Saxon born!      Ye Saxon saints, beware!    For high in heaven though ye dwell,      Shame yet may be your share.      \"Ah, now we know what the comet meant      That rode, blood-red and dire,    Across the midnight firmament      This year on a broom of fire.      \"'Twas an evil star, and Hastings' field      Has fulfilled the omen dread.    We went upon the battle-plain,      And sought among the dead.      \"While still there lingered any hope      We sought, but sought in vain;    King Harold's corse we could not find      Among the bloody slain.\"      Asgod and Ailrik spake and ceased.      The Abbot wrung his hands.    Awhile he pondered, then he sighed,      \"Now mark ye my commands.      \"By the stone of the bard at Grendelfield,      Just midway through the wood,    One, Edith of the Swan's Neck, dwells      In a hovel poor and rude.      \"They named her thus, because her neck      Was once as slim and white    As any swan's--when, long ago,      She was the king's delight.      \"He loved and kissed, forsook, forgot,      For such is the way of men.    Time runs his course with a rapid foot;      It is sixteen years since then.      \"To this woman, brethren, ye shall go,      And she will follow you fain    To the battle-field; the woman's eye      Will not seek the king in vain.      \"Thereafter to Waltham Abbey here      His body ye shall bring,    That Christian burial he may have,      While for his soul we sing.\"      The messengers reached the hut in the wood      At the hour of midnight drear.    \"Wake, Edith of the Swan's Neck, rise      And follow without fear.      \"The Duke of Normandy has won      The battle, to our bane.    On the field of Hastings, where he fought,      The king is lying slain.      \"Arise and come with us; we seek      His body among the dead.    To Waltham Abbey it shall be borne.      'Twas thus our Abbot said.\"      The woman arose and girded her gown,      And silently went behind    The hurrying monks. Her grizzly hair      Streamed wildly on the wind.      Barefoot through bog and bush and briar      She followed and did not stay,    Till Hastings and the cliffs of chalk      They saw at dawn of day.      The mist, that like a sheet of white      The field of battle cloaked,    Melted anon; with hideous din      The daws flew up and croaked.      In thousands on the bloody plain      Lay strewn the piteous corses,    Wounded and torn and maimed and stripped,      Among the fallen horses.      The woman stopped not for the blood;      She waded barefoot through,    And from her fixed and staring eyes      The arrowy glances flew.      Long, with the panting monks behind,      And pausing but to scare    The greedy ravens from their food,      She searched with eager care.      She searched and toiled the livelong day,      Until the night was nigh;    Then sudden from her breast there burst      A shrill and awful cry.      For on the battle-field at last      His body she had found.    She kissed, without a tear or word,      The wan face on the ground.      She kissed his brow, she kissed his mouth,      She clasped him close, and pressed    Her poor lips to the bloody wounds      That gaped upon his breast.      His shoulder stark she kisses too,      When, searching, she discovers    Three little scars her teeth had made      When they were happy lovers.      The monks had been and gotten boughs,      And of these boughs they made    A simple bier, whereon the corse      Of the fallen king was laid.      To Waltham Abbey to his tomb      The king was thus removed;    And Edith of the Swan's Neck walked      By the body that she loved.      She chanted litanies for his soul      With a childish, weird lament    That shuddered through the night. The monks      Prayed softly as they went.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ASRA[47] (1855)      Every evening in the twilight,    To and fro beside the fountain    Where the waters whitely murmured,    Walked the Sultan's lovely daughter.      And a youth, a slave, was standing    Every evening by the fountain    Where the waters whitely murmured;    And his cheek grew pale and paler.      Till one eve the lovely princess    Paused and asked him on a sudden:    \"I would know thy name and country;    I would know thy home and kindred.\"      And the slave replied, \"Mohammed    Is my name; my home is Yemen;    And my people are the Asras;    When they love, they love and die.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE PASSION FLOWER[48] (1856)      I dreamt that once upon a summer night      Beneath the pallid moonlight's eerie glimmer    I saw where, wrought in marble dimly bright,      A ruin of the Renaissance did shimmer.      Yet here and there, in simple Doric form,      A pillar like some solitary giant    Rose from the mass, and, fearless of the storm,      Reared toward the firmament its head defiant.      O'er all that place a heap of wreckage lay,      Triglyphs and pediments and carven portals,    With centaur, sphinx, chimera, satyrs gay--      Figures of fabled monsters and of mortals.      A marble-wrought sarcophagus reposed      Unharmed 'mid fragments of these fabled creatures;    Its lidless depth a dead man's form inclosed,      The pain-wrung face now calm with softened features.      A group of straining caryatides      With steadfast neck the casket's weight supported,    Along both sides whereof there ran a frieze      Of chiseled figures, wondrous ill-assorted.      First one might see where, decked in bright array,      A train of lewd Olympians proudly glided,    Then Adam and Dame Eve, not far away,      With fig-leaf aprons modestly provided.      Next came the people of the Trojan war--      Paris, Achilles, Helen, aged Nestor;    Moses and Aaron, too, with many more--      As Judith, Holofernes, Haman, Esther.      Such forms as Cupid's one could likewise see,      Phoebus Apollo, Vulcan, Lady Venus,    Pluto and Proserpine and Mercury,      God Bacchus and Priapus and Silenus.      Among the rest of these stood Balaam's ass--      A speaking likeness (if you will, a braying)--    And Abraham's sacrifice, and there, alas!      Lot's daughters, too, their drunken sire betraying.      Near by them danced the wanton Salome,      To whom John's head was carried in a charger;    Then followed Satan, writhing horribly,      And Peter with his keys--none e'er seemed larger      Changing once more, the sculptor's cunning skill      Showed lustful Jove misusing his high power,    When as a swan he won fair Leda's will,      And conquered Danae in a golden shower.      Here was Diana, leading to the chase      Her kilted nymphs, her hounds with eyeballs burning;    And here was Hercules in woman's dress,      His warlike hand the peaceful distaff turning.      Not far from them frowned Sinai, bleak and wild,      Along whose slope lay Israel's nomad nation;    Next, one might see our Savior as a child      Amid the elders holding disputation.      Thus were these opposites absurdly blent--      The Grecian joy of living with the godly    Judean cast of thought!--while round them bent      The ivy's tendrils, intertwining oddly.      But--wonderful to say!--while dreamily "]]]
