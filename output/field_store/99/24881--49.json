The more you think about it the more you will agree with me that sleep,  the Father's loving provision for tired people, is a most blessed gift.    Now God gives sleep not only to girls and boys but to all of his  creatures. Do you know how some of those creatures sleep? I will tell  you. Elephants and horses commonly sleep standing up. How would you like  to hear your mother say to you, \"Robert, it's time to go to bed, stand  in the corner there and sleep.\" Most birds sleep with the head turned  toward the tail and the beak poked in under the feathers. Storks, gulls  and all other long-legged birds sleep standing on one leg. It would be  more difficult to sleep that way than just standing in the corner,  wouldn't it? The fox and the wolf sleep with the tip of the nose and the  soles of the feet close together, and the big, bushy tail covering all  to keep them warm. Owls sleep in the daytime. They have eyelids, and  over the eyelids, curtains. These curtains are drawn across the eyes,  sideways, and keep out the strong light of the day. Hares, snakes and  fish sleep with their eyes open.    Why does God give us sleep? Is it for the pleasure of sleeping? No. He  gives us sleep that our bodies and minds may be refreshed. The strength  we have expended during the day is repaid us in the sleep of the night.  Be grateful to your heavenly Father when to-night you kneel to pray:    \"Now I lay me down to sleep.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 127: 2      \"So he giveth his beloved sleep.\"    MEMORY HYMN [541]        _\"Of all the thoughts of God.\"_          ON TIME      I once lived in a town of some five thousand population. In the center  of the town was a public square, and at the most prominent corner of the  square was a jeweler's store. In the window of the store was a clock  which regulated the coming and going of nearly all the inhabitants. You  see the children on their way to school had to pass this store, and they  always glanced in the window to see if they were on time. People going  away had to pass this store to get to the depot; they too looked at the  jeweler's clock to see if they had plenty of time to make their train.  The men who worked in the main factory of the town went by this corner;  each man as he passed would pull out his watch and set it by the  jeweler's clock.    Now one morning, for some reason or other, the clock was fifteen minutes  slow. Children, hurrying to school, looked in at the window, and, seeing  how much time they had they loitered and were late. Men and women, going  to the train or work, glanced at the clock, as was their custom, and,  finding that they did not have to hurry some missed their train, while  others were behind time at work.    We are all human clocks. We set the time for others. Your example, girls  and boys, has much to do with the way other young people, your  companions, act. If you, Mary, fail to get your lessons, some of your  friends are going to say, \"Mary doesn't study much and I'm not going to  either.\" Robert, if you indulge in some bad habit your chum is going to  say, \"Robert does this and I guess I can too.\" Is your life clock  running true? Are you on time?    MEMORY VERSE, _I Peter_ 2: 21        \"For hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us,      leaving us an example, that ye should follow in his steps.\"    MEMORY HYMN [420]        _\"True-hearted, whole-hearted.\"_          DOORS      This morning, after you were awake, you passed through your bedroom  door. Then you went through the bathroom door. Later you entered,  through a door, the dining room. After a time, with your father and  mother, you left the house through the outside door. You walked down the  street and here you are in church, having entered through yonder door.  Every day you are passing through various doors. What wonderful things  doors are! I wonder who invented doors. What would we do without doors?    There are doors to houses and there are doors to life. Let me tell you  about them. A door is made of wood. What beautiful wood is in these  church doors! The doors of life are made of our will. By the exercise of  our will we open and close whatsoever doors of life we choose.    The doors of our houses swing on hinges. Heavy doors seem as light as a  feather because they are so delicately hung upon hinges. The hinges of  the doors of life are made not of brass or iron, but of love.    When, in a little while, you leave this church you will take hold of a  knob and pull open the door. The doors of life have knobs. Those knobs  are called courtesy. You can open well nigh any door you choose if only  you will use the knob courtesy.    What about the lock? Yes, doors have locks. So also have the doors of  life. Can you guess what locks the door of life? It is faith. If you  have faith, faith in God, faith in the Saviour, faith in things that are  true and pure, you need never fear that your house of life will be  broken into by burglars. You are secure if you have the lock of faith.  Now here is a strange paradox, namely--you lock your door only by  opening it. Open your door to the Master.    MEMORY VERSE, _Revelations_ 3: 20        \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice      and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him      and he with me.\"    MEMORY HYMN [282]        _\"O Jesus, thou art standing.\"_          CHEAPEST AND BEST      A business man would not consider this subject a very good  advertisement. He believes that the best things are never cheapest.  There are a few instances however in which that is not the case.    First, the air we breathe. It does not cost us anything, it isn't  metered out to us, so we have a saying, \"as free as air.\" You go down to  the drug store and buy a bottle of perfume. A good perfume will cost not  less than a dollar a bottle. The air we breathe is infinitely purer and  better than the costliest perfume.    Second, the water we drink. Do you like ice cream soda? I am sure you  do. If you do not you are not a normal girl or boy. How much do you have  to pay for a good ice cream soda? That depends; some places it is ten  cents and some fifteen cents. You think you might like to have ice cream  soda every meal, but you would soon tire of it. The water you drink is  necessary, and it costs you nothing.    Third, a book, that is this book, the Bible. If you wish to buy an  up-to-date book of fiction it will cost you anywhere from $1.00 to  $3.00. But here is a book, the most popular, the most wonderful book  that was ever written. You can buy a Bible for a few pennies, and if you  do not have the pennies there is a great Bible Society that will give  you a copy, that none may be without the Word of Life.    Finally, the things that are cheapest and best are the things of the  soul, the spiritual ministries and influences of life. They are worship,  communion, faith, hope, prayer and love. No one stands at yonder door  and demands a dollar of you as you enter. The seats in this church are  free to rich and poor, aged and young. These free seats typify the  salvation that is here proclaimed.    MEMORY VERSE, _Isaiah_ 55: 1        \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that      hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk      without money and without price.\"    MEMORY HYMN [304]        _\"I heard the voice of Jesus.\"_          IN THE DARK      I have here what are commonly known as Chinese lilies. Two weeks ago  they were only two or three inches high. Now they are between two and  three feet. How rapidly they have grown! I How can we account for it? I  can give one reason. It is because they had adequate preparation. The  bulbs from which these lilies grew were kept in the dark for ten days.  There, in the dark, they stored up strength and energy for the work that  was before them.    Many years of our Saviour's life were spent in obscurity. They were  years when, as far as the world is concerned, he was in the dark,  preparing for the great work of his public ministry. My dear young  people, do not be fretful over the days and years you have to go to  school. They are not simply days of waiting, they are days of  preparation.    Again, these lilies come from dark and humble surroundings. Here is a  very plain dish. In the dish are a few ordinary stones; picked up in  our yard. Water is poured upon the stones. Among these stones the lily  bulbs take root. Girls and boys, it does not matter a great deal what  sort of a home you have, if only it is a good home. John Wesley's youth  was hid away in a poor Methodist parsonage. Abraham Lincoln was born and  grew up in the dark and humble surroundings of a log cabin. Our Saviour  himself was born in a manger, and his boyhood home was far from being a  palace. Make the best of what you have and all will be well. God will  take care of you and bring you out of the darkness.    How fragrant these lilies are! Faith, hope, love, patience, strength and  truth, these fragrant qualities of life often grow best in the dark. May  our good Father make your life fragrant is my prayer.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 139: 12        \"Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as      the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.\"    MEMORY HYMN [460]        _\"Lead, kindly light.\"_          THE STILL SMALL VOICE      What is the loudest noise you ever heard? Did you ever hear an immense  cannon fired? Of course you have heard thunder. The loudest, most  terrifying noise I ever heard was a boiler explosion. The town heating  plant was only three doors from my home. The whole plant blew up one  prayer meeting evening. The church building was plunged into darkness,  the walls shook, windows were broken on every side. In terror people got  down on their knees and crept toward the door. That was the loudest  noise I ever heard.    Now I have here a hammer. I will drop it to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#9)"],[1,"me to this last dismay....  'Tis not the altar-stone where men did slay  My father; 'tis a block, a block with gore  Yet hot, that waits me, of one slain before.    Yet not of God unheeded shall we lie.  There cometh after, one who lifteth high  The downfallen; a branch where blossometh  A sire's avenging and a mother's death.  Exiled and wandering, from this land outcast,  One day He shall return, and set the last  Crown on these sins that have his house downtrod.  For, lo, there is a great oath sworn of God,  His father's upturned face shall guide him home.    Why should I grieve? Why pity these men's doom?  I who have seen the City of Ilion  Pass as she passed; and they who cast her down  Have thus their end, as God gives judgement sure....    I go to drink my cup. I will endure  To die. O Gates, Death-Gates, all hail to you!  Only, pray God the blow be stricken true!  Pray God, unagonized, with blood that flows  Quick unto friendly death, these eyes may close!    LEADER.    O full of sorrows, full of wisdom great,  Woman, thy speech is a long anguish; yet,  Knowing thy doom, why walkst thou with clear eyes,  Like some god-blinded beast, to sacrifice?    CASSANDRA.    There is no escape, friends; only vain delay.    LEADER.    Is not the later still the sweeter day?    CASSANDRA.    The day is come. Small profit now to fly.    LEADER.    Through all thy griefs, Woman, thy heart is high.    CASSANDRA.    Alas! None that is happy hears that praise.    LEADER.    Are not the brave dead blest in after days?    CASSANDRA.    O Father! O my brethren brave, I come!      [_She moves towards the House, but recoils shuddering._    LEADER.    What frights thee? What is that thou startest from?    CASSANDRA.    Ah, faugh! Faugh!    LEADER.        What turns thee in that blind  Horror? Unless some loathing of the mind ...    CASSANDRA.    Death drifting from the doors, and blood like rain!    LEADER.    'Tis but the dumb beasts at the altar slain.    CASSANDRA.    And vapours from a charnel-house ... See there!    LEADER.    'Tis Tyrian incense clouding in the air.    CASSANDRA (_recovering herself again_).    So be it!--I will go, in yonder room  To weep mine own and Agamemnon's doom.  May death be all! Strangers, I am no bird  That pipeth trembling at a thicket stirred  By the empty wind. Bear witness on that day  When woman for this woman's life shall pay,  And man for man ill-mated low shall lie:  I ask this boon, as being about to die.    LEADER.    Alas, I pity thee thy mystic fate!    CASSANDRA.    One word, one dirge-song would I utter yet  O'er mine own corpse. To this last shining Sun  I pray that, when the Avenger's work is done,  His enemies may remember this thing too,  This little thing, the woman slave they slew!      O world of men, farewell! A painted show  Is all thy glory; and when life is low  The touch of a wet sponge out-blotteth all.  Oh, sadder this than any proud man's fall!    [_She goes into the House._    CHORUS.    Great Fortune is an hungry thing,    And filleth no heart anywhere,  Though men with fingers menacing    Point at the great house, none will dare,  When Fortune knocks, to bar the door  Proclaiming: \"Come thou here no more!\"  Lo, to this man the Gods have given    Great Ilion in the dust to tread  And home return, emblazed of heaven;  If it is writ, he too shall go  Through blood for blood spilt long ago;  If he too, dying for the dead,    Should crown the deaths of alien years,    What mortal afar off, who hears,  Shall boast him Fortune's Child, and led    Above the eternal tide of tears?            [_A sudden Cry from within._    VOICE.    Ho! Treason in the house! I am wounded: slain.    LEADER.    Hush! In the castle! 'Twas a cry  Of some man wounded mortally.    VOICE.    Ah God, another! I am stricken again.    LEADER.    I think the deed is done. It was the King  Who groaned.... Stand close, and think if anything....      [_The Old Men gather together under the shock, and debate confusedly._    ELDER B.    I give you straight my judgement. Summon all  The citizens to rescue. Sound a call!    ELDER C.    No, no! Burst in at once without a word!  In, and convict them by their dripping sword!    ELDER D.    Yes; that or something like it. Quick, I say,  Be doing! 'Tis a time for no delay.    ELDER E.    We have time to think. This opening ... They have planned  Some scheme to make enslavement of the land.    ELDER F.    Yes, while we linger here! They take no thought  Of lingering, and their sword-arm sleepeth not!    ELDER G.    I have no counsel. I can speak not. Oh,  Let him give counsel who can strike a blow!    ELDER H.    I say as this man says. I have no trust  In words to raise a dead man from the dust.    ELDER I.    How mean you?  Drag out our poor lives, and stand  Cowering to these defilers of the land?    ELDER J.    Nay, 'tis too much! Better to strive and die!  Death is an easier doom than slavery.    ELDER K.    We heard a sound of groaning, nothing plain,  How know we--are we seers?--that one is slain?    ELDER L.    Oh, let us find the truth out, ere we grow  Thus passionate! To surmise is not to know.    LEADER.    Break in, then! 'Tis the counsel ye all bring,  And learn for sure, how is it with the King.      [_They cluster up towards the Palace Door, as though to force an  entrance, when the great Door swings open, revealing_ CLYTEMNESTRA, _who  stands, axe in hand, over the dead bodies of_ AGAMEMNON _and_ CASSANDRA.  _The body of_  AGAMEMNON _is wrapped in a rich crimson web. There is blood  on_ CLYTEMNESTRA'S_ brow, and she speaks in wild triumph._    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Oh, lies enough and more have I this day  Spoken, which now I shame not to unsay.  How should a woman work, to the utter end,  Hate on a damned hater, feigned a friend;  How pile perdition round him, hunter-wise,  Too high for overleaping, save by lies?  To me this hour was dreamed of long ago;  A thing of ancient hate. 'Twas very slow  In coming, but it came. And here I stand  Even where I struck, with all the deed I planned  Done! 'Twas so wrought--what boots it to deny?--  The man could neither guard himself nor fly.  An endless web, as by some fisher strung,  A deadly plenteousness of robe, I flung  All round him, and struck twice; and with two cries  His limbs turned water and broke; and as he lies  I cast my third stroke in, a prayer well-sped  To Zeus of Hell, who guardeth safe his dead!  So there he gasped his life out as he lay;  And, gasping, the blood spouted ... Like dark spray  That splashed, it came, a salt and deathly dew;  Sweet, sweet as God's dear rain-drops ever blew  O'er a parched field, the day the buds are born! ...    Which things being so, ye Councillors high-born,  Depart in joy, if joy ye will. For me,  I glory. Oh, if such a thing might be  As o'er the dead thank-offering to outpour,  On this dead it were just, aye, just and more,  Who filled the cup of the House with treacheries  Curse-fraught, and here hath drunk it to the lees!    LEADER.    We are astonied at thy speech. To fling,  Wild mouth! such vaunt over thy murdered King!    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Wouldst fright me, like a witless woman? Lo,  This bosom shakes not.  And, though well ye know,  I tell you ... Curse me as ye will, or bless,  'Tis all one ... This is Agamemnon; this,  My husband, dead by my right hand, a blow  Struck by a righteous craftsman. Aye, 'tis so.    CHORUS.    Woman, what evil tree,    What poison grown of the ground  Or draught of the drifting sea    Way to thy lips hath found,  Making thee clothe thy heart    In rage, yea, in curses burning  When thine own people pray?  Thou hast hewn, thou hast cast away;  And a thing cast away thou art,    A thing of hate and a spurning!    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Aye, now, for me, thou hast thy words of fate;  Exile from Argos and the people's hate  For ever! Against him no word was cried,  When, recking not, as 'twere a beast that died,  With flocks abounding o'er his wide domain,  He slew his child, my love, my flower of pain, ...  Great God, as magic for the winds of Thrace!  Why was not he man-hunted from his place,  To purge the blood that stained him? ... When the deed  Is mine, oh, then thou art a judge indeed!  But threat thy fill. I am ready, and I stand  Content; if thy hand beateth down my hand,  Thou rulest. If aught else be God's decree,  Thy lesson shall be learned, though late it be.    CHORUS.    Thy thought, it is very proud;    Thy breath is the scorner's breath;  Is not the madness loud    In thy heart, being drunk with death?  Yea, and above thy brow    A star of the wet blood burneth!  Oh, doom shall have yet her day,  The last friend cast away,  When lie doth answer lie    And a stab for a stab returneth!    CLYTEMNESTRA.    And heark what Oath-gods gather to my side!  By my dead child's Revenge, now satisfied,  By Mortal Blindness, by all Powers of Hell  Which Hate, to whom in sacrifice he fell,  My Hope shall walk not in the house of Fear,  While on my hearth one fire yet burneth clear,  One lover, one Aigisthos, as of old!    What should I fear, when fallen here I hold  This foe, this scorner of his wife, this toy  And fool of each Chryseis under Troy;  And there withal his soothsayer and slave,  His chanting bed-fellow, his leman brave,  Who rubbed the galleys' benches at his side.  But, oh, they had their guerdon as they died!  For he lies thus, and she, the wild swan's way,  Hath trod her last long weeping roundelay,  And lies, his lover, ravisht o'er the main  For his bed's comfort and my deep disdain.    CHORUS. (_Some Elders_.)    Would God that suddenly  With no great agony,    No long sick-watch to keep,  My hour would come to me,  My hour, and presently  Bring the eternal, the    Unwaking Sleep,  Now that my Shepherd, he  Whose love watched over me,    Lies in the deep!    ANOTHER.    For woman's sake he endured and battled well,    And by a woman's hand he fell.    OTHERS.    What hast thou done, O Helen blind of"]]]
