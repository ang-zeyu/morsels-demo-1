Then  the herald recited the rewards which the great and free city offered  to the most successful competitors: they were worthy of the great  League of which Dantzic was the head:--A house to be kept up at the  expense of the State, to be styled the \"most honorable,\" a ring  of honor, but above all, a laurel wreath, and to have precedence  immediately after the Supreme Council itself. Such was the attachment  of the inhabitants of Dantzic to their town and its glories that  its embellishment was dearer to them than any personal or material  advantages. But it is probable that these honors would not have been  so great on the present occasion had the Grand Master not been fully  impressed with the belief that his own son would succeed in the  contest, and add another and the greatest to the honors which belonged  to his house. Marguerite and Dumiger pressed forward through the crowd  to hear the proclamation read, and the blood flowed in their cheeks  as they listened. Dumiger turned to look at Marguerite, her eyes were  moist with love and admiration; he pressed her arm fondly, and said in  a low voice,--    \"Now, Marguerite, will you forgive me the hours passed in solitude, in  selfish silence, when you know how highly the city estimates this work  to which my nights and days have been devoted?\"    Her only answer was a glance of affection which thrilled through his  frame.    It was night, they were tired of wandering about, and entered one of  the numerous _cafes_ which had been temporarily erected in celebration  of the day. In the center of the Grande Place a stage was built for  dancing, and when the band played its liveliest tunes the bright-eyed  dancers swept round in admirable time; the variegated lamps which hung  around the square checkered the pavement with every variety of hue,  cast such a glory on the fountain that its outline was worked as it  were with threads of gold. All these different colors and shapes were  reflected in the rippling waves of the ever-rolling waters. Youths in  the gayest dresses strutted away their proud hour of triumph with that  graceful vanity of pretension which youth so well becomes, or flirted  with the tender maidens, who in silver-laced bodice and scarlet skirt,  with their brows encircled with interwoven wild flowers, sat round the  brink of the fountain, where the murmurs of the ever-falling waters  could best conceal the murmurs of love. And above all this gorgeous  tumult and bright excitement the moon from her throne of silver clouds  rose like a virgin queen; the bold architecture of the Dom stood in  clear relief, some parts as though sculptured out of heaven's light,  while the depths of the arches were buried in mysterious shade,  emblematic of the faith to which it was dedicated,--in part clear to  the fresh comprehension of the youngest child, and again full of deep  and fathomless mysteries. Athwart the flood of light which filled the  square, the deep shade of this noble Dom was thrown, like the dark  visions of the future which sometimes fall upon the heart in its hours  of brightest enjoyment. If one had stood that night on the lofty tower  and looked forth on the vast multitude, he need not, Asmodeus-like,  have unroofed the houses to read the history of human life or the  passions of the human heart, for life and passion had gone forth  that night from many a tranquil abode to revel in publicity. One so  standing above the wild hum of tumultuous enjoyment would in silent  thought have marveled at the strange drama performing as it were at  his feet,--the sad and fearful mixture of the shadows and lights of  life and death, the market-place, and close at hand the burial-ground.  Talk of contemplation in the wild solitudes of the country, how much  more is there room for contemplation in the crowded mart and the  bustling thoroughfare! Where is the river whose current is so rapid as  the current of life, or at time so dangerous and treacherous? Where  is the tide whose ebb and flow is so uncertain as the ebb and flow of  existence? Where are to be found winds and waves more boisterous than  those which agitate the human heart? Where is the shore so strewn with  wrecks as the heart with the broken memorials of passion which may  have long since swept over it? If Nature in its solitude affords  calm enjoyment, in its human development it affords matter for deeper  thought; if the view from the mountain-top, extending over hill  and dale, expand the mind, to stand above the wild tumult of a town  equally exalts the imagination and conveys knowledge, even while it  compels the gazer to pass out of himself.    As they approached a coffee-house on the same side of the street as  the Dom, Marguerite proposed to Dumiger to remain there, where they  could best see the dancing, and she drew a chair toward her.    \"No, no, not here!\" exclaimed Dumiger; and he took her across the  square to another house of greater reputation.    But it was not on this account that Dumiger preferred it, but because  it had a view of the Dom; he could there contemplate the space which  was left for the clock, of which he fondly believed he was making the  model. He pictured to himself that tower, the wonder and admiration  of the town; that on the spot where he was then sitting numbers would  crowd to view the wonderful machinery fashioned by his genius.    The history of the _cafe_ to which he took Marguerite was curious;  it had been opened not less than one hundred and twenty years without  being once entirely closed. It was, in point of fact, formed by two  houses, which were used alternately to allow of the necessary repairs  and cleansings. On such an occasion as the present they were both  thrown open,--the one part was for persons of the second rank, amongst  which Dumiger and Marguerite now classed themselves; the other was  reserved for the people of the higher order, for in this city of  popular institutions and liberal opinions the distinction of classes  was very strictly preserved.    Marguerite and Dumiger ordered some slight refreshment. Marguerite  was enjoying that repose which is so agreeable to the mind after the  sensation of strong happiness; Dumiger, with his head resting on his  hand, was gazing on the lofty tower of the Dom, and the light fleecy  clouds, which appeared to be almost attracted by the glittering vane.  At that moment a rude hand slapped his shoulder.    \"You here, Dumiger!\" said Carl. \"Why, Confound it, man. I thought you  were poring over dull tomes of the University library, or worshiping  a saint\" and he took off his hat to Marguerite. \"Here is Krantz, your  old friend Krantz, whom you have not seen since we were all at Bonn  together: so I will drink with you as well as he did three years  since, when we reveled in Rhenish.\"    Dumiger seized the extended hand, a gleam shot across his mind: the  three years of abstraction and thought appeared to be swept away; he  only beheld his two boon companions; his countenance was lightened of  a dozen years.    \"Marguerite, these are two friends of mine,\" he said; \"it is getting  late and cold. See, the lights on the fountains are burning very dim,  and the benches are deserted. You will not grudge me this one night  for acquaintance sake, dear Marguerite? I shall not he late, but I  must grant myself one bottle to-night to drink to my success. What,  angry, my Marguerite!\"    She was not angry, but she thought that love in life is of rare  fulfillment. Again another night of loneliness: yesterday it was a  disagreeable necessity, now an agreeable excitement, but both alike  led to a lonely room and a lonely heart. But in the shade Dumiger  pressed her hand, and assured her with many kisses that he would  return within two hours, and she tried to feel satisfied and assured.  The three friends sat down; a larger table replaced the small stand  which had been exclusively devoted to ices; three bottles of huge  dimensions were brought from the cellar; pledge after pledge was  received and given. Dumiger became a different man, save that at  moments, in the midst of some burst of louder hilarity, the cloud of  ambition would cross his brow and seem to furrow it, and then he would  fold his arms across his breast, as if to repress the outbreak of  his soul. It was during one of these moments of abstraction that Carl  turned suddenly round.    \"Why, Dumiger,\" he exclaimed, \"you do not fill your glass! In former  days, man, you were of a very different mood. Has marriage so tamed  you? Won't Marguerite allow it!\"    Krantz and the two friends made the place ring with their rude  students' laugh. \"Ha! ha! I, why I am in excellent spirits,\" said  Dumiger, filling a bumper with the strongest of the wines upon the  table. \"I ought to be in good spirits, for I have everything to make  me so.\"    \"Ay, the most beautiful girl in Dantzic for a wife,\" said Carl.    \"With a large fortune?\" said Krantz, laughing.    \"That will come,\" replied Dumiger, heated by wine.    \"Large fortune!\" they both exclaimed; \"where are you to get it,  student? Have you found an old cave in the Grime Thor, Dumiger, with a  fortune buried, as the old romances have it?\"    \"Yes, I shall soon discover a fortune,\" exclaimed the boy, now fairly  excited, and his cheeks glowing with animation; \"and more than a  fortune. Fame and honors shall be heaped upon us. Do you imagine that  I have been wasting the last three years of my life? do you believe  that the ambition which was the subject of your illusive aim at  college is dead? No! look here, Carl and Krantz, this day week will  see me famous, and ennoble my family till it vies even with the Grand  Master's.\"    \"You are mad,\" said Carl.    \"No, I am speaking words of soberness,\" said he, with an earnestness  which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#9)"],[1,"four I was drinking coffee and shivering. The horse, Buck, was hard to  catch this second morning. Whether some hills that we were now in  had excited him, or whether the better water up here had caused an  effervescence in his spirits, I cannot say. But I was as hot as July by  the time we had him safe in harness, or, rather, unsafe in harness. For  Buck, in the mysterious language of horses, now taught wickedness to  his side partner, and about eleven o'clock they laid their evil heads  together and decided to break our necks.    We were passing, I have said, through a range of demi-mountains. It was  a little country where trees grew, water ran, and the plains were shut  out for a while. The road had steep places in it, and places here and  there where you could fall off and go bounding to the bottom among  stones. But Buck, for some reason, did not think these opportunities  good enough for him. He selected a more theatrical moment. We emerged  from a narrow canyon suddenly upon five hundred cattle and some cow-boys  branding calves by a fire in a corral. It was a sight that Buck knew by  heart. He instantly treated it like an appalling phenomenon. I saw  him kick seven ways; I saw Muggins kick five ways; our furious motion  snapped my spine like a whip. I grasped the seat. Something gave a  forlorn jingle. It was the brake.    \"Don't jump!\" commanded the trustworthy man.    \"No,\" I said, as my hat flew off.    Help was too far away to do anything for us. We passed scatheless through  a part of the cattle, I saw their horns and backs go by. Some earth  crumbled, and we plunged downward into water rocking among stones, and  upward again through some more crumbling earth. I heard a crash, and saw  my trunk landing in the stream.    \"She's safer there,\" said the trustworthy man.    \"True,\" I said.    \"We'll go back for her,\" said he, with his eye on the horses and his  foot on the crippled brake. A dry gully was coming, and no room to turn.  The farther side of it was terraced with rock. We should simply fall  backward, if we did not fall forward first. He steered the horses  straight over, and just at the bottom swung them, with astonishing  skill, to the right along the hard-baked mud. They took us along the bed  up to the head of the gully, and through a thicket of quaking asps. The  light trees bent beneath our charge and bastinadoed the wagon as it went  over them. But their branches enmeshed the horses' legs, and we came to  a harmless standstill among a bower of leaves.    I looked at the trustworthy man, and smiled vaguely. He considered me  for a moment.    \"I reckon,\" said he, \"you're feelin' about halfway between 'Oh, Lord!'  and 'Thank God!'\"    \"That's quite it,\" said I, as he got down on the ground.    \"Nothing's broke,\" said he, after a searching examination. And he  indulged in a true Virginian expletive. \"Gentlemen, hush!\" he murmured  gently, looking at me with his grave eyes; \"one time I got pretty near  scared. You, Buck,\" he continued, \"some folks would beat you now till  yu'd be uncertain whether yu' was a hawss or a railroad accident. I'd do  it myself, only it wouldn't cure yu'.\"    I now told him that I supposed he had saved both our lives. But he  detested words of direct praise. He made some grumbling rejoinder, and  led the horses out of the thicket. Buck, he explained to me, was a good  horse, and so was Muggins. Both of them generally meant well, and that  was the Judge's reason for sending them to meet me. But these broncos  had their off days. Off days might not come very often; but when the  humor seized a bronco, he had to have his spree. Buck would now behave  himself as a horse should for probably two months. \"They are just like  humans,\" the Virginian concluded.    Several cow-boys arrived on a gallop to find how many pieces of us were  left. We returned down the hill; and when we reached my trunk, it was  surprising to see the distance that our runaway had covered. My hat was  also found, and we continued on our way.    Buck and Muggins were patterns of discretion through the rest of the  mountains. I thought when we camped this night that it was strange Buck  should be again allowed to graze at large, instead of being tied to a  rope while we slept. But this was my ignorance. With the hard work that  he was gallantly doing, the horse needed more pasture than a rope's  length would permit him to find. Therefore he went free, and in the  morning gave us but little trouble in catching him.    We crossed a river in the forenoon, and far to the north of us we saw  the Bow Leg Mountains, pale in the bright sun. Sunk Creek flowed from  their western side, and our two hundred and sixty-three miles began to  grow a small thing in my eyes. Buck and Muggins, I think, knew perfectly  that to-morrow would see them home. They recognized this region; and  once they turned off at a fork in the road. The Virginian pulled them  back rather sharply.    \"Want to go back to Balaam's?\" he inquired of them. \"I thought you had  more sense.\"    I asked, \"Who was Balaam?\"    \"A maltreater of hawsses,\" replied the cow-puncher. \"His ranch is on  Butte Creek oveh yondeh.\" And he pointed to where the diverging road  melted into space. \"The Judge bought Buck and Muggins from him in the  spring.\"    \"So he maltreats horses?\" I repeated.    \"That's the word all through this country. A man that will do what  they claim Balaam does to a hawss when he's mad, ain't fit to be called  human.\" The Virginian told me some particulars.    \"Oh!\" I almost screamed at the horror of it, and again, \"Oh!\"    \"He'd have prob'ly done that to Buck as soon as he stopped runnin' away.  If I caught a man doin' that--\"    We were interrupted by a sedate-looking traveller riding upon an equally  sober horse.    \"Mawnin', Taylor,\" said the Virginian, pulling up for gossip. \"Ain't you  strayed off your range pretty far?\"    \"You're a nice one!\" replied Mr. Taylor, stopping his horse and smiling  amiably.    \"Tell me something I don't know,\" retorted the Virginian.    \"Hold up a man at cards and rob him,\" pursued Mr. Taylor. \"Oh, the news  has got ahead of you!\"    \"Trampas has been hyeh explainin', has he?\" said the Virginian with a  grin.    \"Was that your victim's name?\" said Mr. Taylor, facetiously. \"No, it  wasn't him that brought the news. Say, what did you do, anyway?\"    \"So that thing has got around,\" murmured the Virginian. \"Well, it wasn't  worth such wide repawtin'.\" And he gave the simple facts to Taylor,  while I sat wondering at the contagious powers of Rumor. Here, through  this voiceless land, this desert, this vacuum, it had spread like a  change of weather. \"Any news up your way?\" the Virginian concluded.    Importance came into Mr. Taylor's countenance. \"Bear Creek is going to  build a schoolhouse,\" said he.    \"Goodness gracious!\" drawled the Virginian. \"What's that for?\"    Now Mr. Taylor had been married for some years. \"To educate the  offspring of Bear Creek,\" he answered with pride.    \"Offspring of Bear Creek,\" the Virginian meditatively repeated. \"I don't  remember noticin' much offspring. There was some white tail deer, and a  right smart o' jack rabbits.\"    \"The Swintons have moved up from Drybone,\" said Mr. Taylor, always  seriously. \"They found it no place for young children. And there's Uncle  Carmody with six, and Ben Dow. And Westfall has become a family man,  and--\"    \"Jim Westfall!\" exclaimed the Virginian. \"Him a fam'ly man! Well, if  this hyeh Territory is goin' to get full o' fam'ly men and empty o'  game, I believe I'll--\"    \"Get married yourself,\" suggested Mr. Taylor.    \"Me! I ain't near reached the marriageable age. No, seh! But Uncle  Hughey has got there at last, yu' know.\"    \"Uncle Hughey!\" shouted Mr. Taylor. He had not heard this. Rumor is very  capricious. Therefore the Virginian told him, and the family man rocked  in his saddle.    \"Build your schoolhouse,\" said the Virginian. \"Uncle Hughey has  qualified himself to subscribe to all such propositions. Got your eye on  a schoolmarm?\"          V. ENTER THE WOMAN      \"We are taking steps,\" said Mr. Taylor. \"Bear Creek ain't going to be  hasty about a schoolmarm.\"    \"Sure,\" assented the Virginian. \"The children wouldn't want yu' to  hurry.\"    But Mr. Taylor was, as I have indicated, a serious family man. The  problem of educating his children could appear to him in no light except  a sober one. \"Bear Creek,\" he said, \"don't want the experience they had  over at Calef. We must not hire an ignoramus.\"    \"Sure!\" assented the Virginian again.    \"Nor we don't want no gad-a-way flirt,\" said Mr. Taylor.    \"She must keep her eyes on the blackboa'd,\" said the Virginian, gently.    \"Well, we can wait till we get a guaranteed article,\" said Mr. Taylor.  \"And that's what we're going to do. It can't be this year, and it  needn't to be. None of the kids is very old, and the schoolhouse has got  to be built.\" He now drew a letter from his pocket, and looked at me.  \"Are you acquainted with Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington, Vermont?\"  he inquired.    I was not acquainted with her at this time.    \"She's one we are thinking of. She's a correspondent with Mrs. Balaam.\"  Taylor handed me the letter. \"She wrote that to Mrs. Balaam, and Mrs.  Balaam said the best thing was for to let me see it and judge for  myself. I'm taking it back to Mrs. Balaam. Maybe you can give me your  opinion how it sizes up with the letters they write back East?\"    The communication was mainly of a business kind, but also personal,  and freely written. I do not think that its writer expected it to be  exhibited as a document. The writer wished very much that she could see  the West. But she could not gratify this desire merely for pleasure,  or she would long ago have accepted the kind invitation to visit Mrs.  Balaam's ranch. Teaching school was something she would like to do, if  she were fitted for it. \"Since the mills failed\" (the writer said) \"we"]]]
