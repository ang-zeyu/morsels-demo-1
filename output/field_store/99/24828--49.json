Cobs, walnut-bark, or walnut-chips, are the best to use  for smoking, on account of the sweet taste they give the meat. The  smallest pieces should be smoked forty-eight hours, and large legs  four or five days. Some people prefer the mutton boiled as soon as it  is taken from the pickle, before it is smoked; others hang it up till  it gets dry thoroughly, and eat it in thin slices, like hung beef.  When legs of meat are put in pickle, the thickest part of the leg  should be placed uppermost, that is, standing upright, the same as the  creature stood when living. The same rule should be observed when they  are hung up to dry; it is essential in order to keep in the juices of  the meat. Meat should be turned over once or twice during the process  of smoking.    The old-fashioned way for curing hams is to rub them with salt very  thoroughly, and let them lay twenty-four hours. To each ham allow  two ounces of salt-petre, one quart of common salt and one quart of  molasses. First baste them with molasses; next rub in the salt-petre;  and, last of all, the common salt. They must be carefully turned  and rubbed every day for six weeks; then hang them in a chimney, or  smoke-house, four weeks.    They should be well covered up in paper bags, and put in a chest, or  barrel, with layers of ashes, or charcoal, between. When you take out  a ham to cut for use, be sure and put it away in a dark place, well  covered up; especially in summer.    Some very experienced epicures and cooks, think the old-fashioned way  of preparing bacon is troublesome and useless. They say that legs of  pork placed upright in pickle, for four or five weeks, are just as  nice as those rubbed with so much care. The pickle for pork and hung  beef, should be stronger than for legs of mutton. Eight pounds of  salt, ten ounces of salt-petre and five pints of molasses is enough  for one hundred weight of meat; water enough to cover the meat  well--probably, four or five gallons. Any one can prepare bacon, or  dried beef, very easily, in a common oven, according to the above  directions. The same pickle that answers for bacon is proper for  neat's tongues. Pigs' tongues are very nice, prepared in the same  way as neat's tongues; an abundance of them are sold for rein-deer's  tongues, and, under that name, considered a wonderful luxury.    Neat's tongue should be boiled full three hours. If it has been in  salt long, it is well to soak it over night in cold water. Put it in  to boil when the water is cold. If you boil it in a small pot, it is  well to change the water, when it has boiled an hour and a half; the  fresh water should boil before the half-cooked tongue is put in again.  It is nicer for being kept in a cool place a day or two after being  boiled. Nearly the same rules apply to salt beef. A six pound piece  of corned beef should boil full three hours; and salt beef should be  boiled four hours.    The saltier meat is, the longer it should be boiled. If very salt, it  is well to put it in soak over night; change the water while cooking;  and observe the same rules as in boiling tongue. If it is intended to  be eaten when cold, it is a good plan to put it between clean boards,  and press it down with heavy weights for a day or two. A small leg  of bacon should be boiled three hours; ten pounds four hours; twelve  pounds five hours. All meat should boil moderately; furious boiling  injures the flavor.    Buffalo's tongue should soak a day and a night, and boil as much as  six hours.           *       *       *       *       *          CHOICE OF MEAT.      If people wish to be economical, they should take some pains to  ascertain what are the cheapest pieces of meat to buy; not merely  those which are cheapest in price, but those which go farthest when  cooked. That part of mutton called the rack, which consists of the  neck, and a few of the rib bones below, is cheap food. It is not more  than four or five cents a pound; and four pounds will make a dinner  for six people. The neck, cut into pieces, and boiled slowly an hour  and a quarter, in little more than water enough to cover it, makes  very nice broth. A great spoonful of rice should be washed and  thrown in with the meat. About twenty minutes before it is done, put  in a little thickening, and season with salt, pepper, and sifted  summer-savory, or sage. The bones below the neck, broiled, make a good  mutton chop. If your family be small, a rack of mutton will make you  two dinners,--broth once, and mutton chop with a few slices of salt  pork, for another; if your family consist of six or seven, you can  have two dishes for a dinner. If you boil the whole rack for broth,  there will be some left for mince meat.    Liver is usually much despised; but when well cooked, it is very  palatable; and it is the cheapest of all animal food. Veal liver is  by some considered the best. Veal liver is usually two cents a pound;  beef liver is one cent. After you have fried a few slices of salt  pork, put the liver in while the fat is very hot, and cook it through  thoroughly. If you doubt whether it be done, cut into a slice, and see  whether it has turned entirely brown, without any red stripe in the  middle. Season it with pepper and salt, and butter, if you live on a  farm, and have butter in plenty. It should not be cooked on furiously  hot coals, as it is very apt to scorch. Sprinkle in a little flour,  stir it, and pour in boiling water to make gravy, just as you would  for fried meat. Some think liver is better dipped in sifted Indian  meal before it is fried. It is good broiled and buttered like a steak.  It should be cut into slices about as thick as are cut for steaks.    The heart, liver, &c. of a pig is good fried; so is that of a lamb.  The latter is commonly called lamb-fry; and a dinner may be bought for  six or eight cents. Be sure and ask for the sweet-bread; for butchers  are extremely apt to reserve it for their own use; and therefore  lamb-fry is almost always sold without it. Fry five or six slices of  salt pork; after it is taken out, put in your lamb-fry while the fat  is hot. Do it thoroughly; but be careful the fire is not too furious,  as it is apt to scorch. Take a large handful of parsley, see that it  is washed clean, cut it up pretty fine; then pour a little boiling  water into the fat in which your dinner has been fried, and let the  parsley cook in it a minute or two; then take it out in a spoon, and  lay it over your slices of meat. Some people, who like thick gravies,  shake in a little flour into the spider, before pouring in the boiling  water.    Bones from which roasting pieces have been cut, may be bought in the  market for ten or twelve cents, from which a very rich soup may be  made, besides skimming off fat for shortening. If the bones left from  the rump be bought, they will be found full of marrow, and will give  more than a pint of good shortening, without injuring the richness of  the soup. The richest piece of beef for a soup is the leg and the shin  of beef; the leg is on the hind quarter, and the shin is on the fore  quarter. The leg rand, that is, the thick part of the leg above the  bony parts, is very nice for mince pies. Some people have an objection  to these parts of beef, thinking they must be stringy; but, if boiled  _very tender_, the sinews are not perceived, and add, in fact, to the  richness of a soup.    The thick part of a thin flank is the most profitable part in the  whole ox to buy. It is not so handsome in appearance as some other  pieces, but it is thick meat, with very little bone, and is usually  two cents less in the pound than more fashionable pieces. It is good  for roasting, and particularly for corning and salting. The navel end  of the brisket is one of the best pieces for salting or corning, and  is very good for roasting.    The rattle rand is the very best piece for corning, or salting.    A bullock's heart is very profitable to use as a steak. Broiled just  like beef. There are usually five pounds in a heart, and it can be  bought for twenty-five cents. Some people stuff and roast it.    The chuck, between the neck and the shoulder, is a very good piece for  roasting,--for steaks, or for salting. Indeed, it is good for almost  anything; and it is cheap, being from four to five cents a pound.    The richest, tenderest, and most delicate piece of beef for roasting,  or for steak, is the rump and the last cut of the sirloin. It is  peculiarly appropriate for an invalid, as it is lighter food than any  other beef.    But if economy be consulted instead of luxury, the round will be  bought in preference to the rump. It is heartier food, and, of course,  less can be eaten; and it is cheaper in price.    The shoulder of veal is the most economical for roasting or boiling.  It is always cheap, let veal bear what price it may. Two dinners may  be made from it; the shoulder roasted, and the knuckle cut off to be  boiled with a bit of pork and greens, or to be made into soup.    The breast of veal is a favorite piece, and is sold high.    The hind-quarter of veal and the loin make two good roasting pieces.  The leg is usually stuffed. The line has the kidney upon it; the  fore-quarter has the brisket on it. This is a sweet and delicate  morsel; for this reason some people prefer the fore-quarter to any  other part.    Always buy a shoulder of pork for economy, for roasting, or coming to  boil. Cut off the leg to be boiled. Many people buy the upper part of  the spare-rib of pork thinking it the most genteel; but the lower part  of the spare-rib toward the neck is much more sweet and juicy, and  there is more meat in proportion to the bone.    The breast, or shoulder, of mutton are both nice, either for roasting,  boiling or broth. The breast is richer than the shoulder. It is more  economical to buy a fore-quarter of mutton than a hind-quarter;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#9)"],[1,"home, leaving Yan to his fate. There was no  longer any question that it was a Lynx. Yan had felt nervous before  and the abject flight of the dog reacted on him. He realized how  defenseless he was, still weak from his illness, and he turned and  went after the dog. At first he walked. But having given in to his  fears, they increased; and as the yowling continued he finally ran his  fastest. The sounds were left behind, but Yan never stopped until he  had left the Glen and was once more in the open valley of the river.  Here he found the valiant retriever trembling all over. Yan received  him with a contemptuous kick, and, boylike, as soon as he could find  some stones, he used them till Grip was driven home.           *       *       *       *       *    Most lads have some sporting instinct, and his elder brother, though  not of Yan's tastes, was not averse to going gunning when there was a  prospect of sport.    Yan decided to reveal to Rad the secret of his glen. He had never been  allowed to use a gun, but Rad had one, and Yan's vivid account of his  adventure had the desired effect. His method was characteristic.    [Illustration: \"It surely was a Lynx.\"]    \"Rad, would you go huntin' if there was lots to hunt?\"    \"Course I would.\"    \"Well, I know a place not ten miles away where there are all kinds of  wild animals--hundreds of them.\"    \"Yes, you do, I don't think. Humph!\"    \"Yes, I do; and I'll tell you, if you will promise never to tell a  soul.\"    \"Ba-ah!\"    \"Well, I just had an adventure with a Lynx up there now, and if you  will come with your gun we can get him.\"    Then Yan related all that had passed, and it lost nothing in his  telling. His brother was impressed enough to set out under Yan's  guidance on the following Saturday.    Yan hated to reveal to his sneering, earthy-minded brother all the  joys and sorrows he had found in the Glen, but now that it seemed  compulsory he found keen pleasure in playing the part of the crafty  guide. With unnecessary caution he first led in a wrong direction,  then trying, but failing, to extort another promise of secrecy, he  turned at an angle, pointed to a distant tree, saying with all the  meaning he could put into it: \"Ten paces beyond that tree is a trail  that shall lead us into the secret valley.\" After sundry other  ceremonies of the sort, they were near the inway, when a man came  walking through the bushes. On his shoulders he carried something.  When he came close, Yan saw to his deep disgust that that something  was the Lynx--yes, it surely was _his_ Lynx.    They eagerly plied the man with questions. He told them that he had  killed it the day before, really. It had been prowling for the last  week or more about Kernore's bush; probably it was a straggler from up  north.    This was all intensely fascinating to Yan, but in it was a jarring  note. Evidently this man considered the Glen--his Glen--as an  ordinary, well-known bit of bush, possibly part of his farm--not by  any means the profound mystery that Yan would have had it.    The Lynx was a fine large one. The stripes on its face and the wide  open yellow eyes gave a peculiarly wild, tiger-like expression that  was deeply gratifying to Yan's romantic soul.    It was not so much of an adventure as a might-have-been adventure;  but it left a deep impress on the boy, and it also illustrated the  accuracy of his instincts in identifying creatures that he had never  before seen, but knew only through the slight descriptions of very  unsatisfactory books.          XIV    Froth      From now on to the spring Yan was daily gaining in strength, and he  and his mother came closer together. She tried to take an interest in  the pursuits that were his whole nature. But she also strove hard to  make him take an interest in her world. She was a morbidly religious  woman. Her conversation was bristling with Scripture texts. She had  a vast store of them--indeed, she had them all; and she used them on  every occasion possible and impossible, with bewildering efficiency.    If ever she saw a group of young people dancing, romping, playing any  game, or even laughing heartily, she would interrupt them to say,  \"Children, are you sure you can ask God's blessing on all this? Do you  think that beings with immortal souls to save should give rein to such  frivolity! I fear you are sinning, and be sure your sin will find  you out. Remember, that for every idle word and deed we must give an  account to the Great Judge of Heaven and earth.\"    She was perfectly sincere in all this, but she never ceased, except  during the time of her son's illness, when, under orders from the  doctor, she avoided the painful topic of eternal happiness and tried  to simulate an interest in his pursuits. This was the blessed truce  that brought them together.    He found a confidante for the first time since he met the collarless  stranger, and used to tell all his loves and fears among the woodfolk  and things. He would talk about this or that bird or flower, and hoped  to find out its name, till the mother would suddenly feel shocked that  any being with an immortal soul to save could talk so seriously  about anything outside of the Bible; then gently reprove her son and  herself, too, with a number of texts.    He might reply with others, for he was well equipped. But her  unanswerable answer would be: \"There is but one thing needful. What  profiteth it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\"    These fencing bouts grew more frequent as Yan grew stronger and the  doctor's inhibition was removed.    After one of unusual warmth, Yan realized with a chill that all her  interest in his pursuits had been an affected one. He was silent a  long time, then said: \"Mother! you like to talk about your Bible. It  tells you the things that you long to know, that you love to learn.  You would be unhappy if you went a day without reading a chapter or  two. That is your nature; God made you so.    \"I have been obliged to read the Bible all my life. Every day I read a  chapter; but I do not love it. I read it because I am forced to do it.  It tells me nothing I want to know. It does not teach me to love God,  which you say is the one thing needful. But I go out into the woods,  and every bird and flower I see stirs me to the heart with something,  I do not know what it is; only I love them: I love them with all my  strength, and they make me feel like praying when your Bible does not.  They are my Bible. This is my nature. God made me so.\"    The mother was silent after this, but Yan could see that she was  praying for him as for a lost soul.    A few days later they were out walking in the early spring morning.  A Shore-lark on a clod whistled prettily as it felt the growing  sunshine.    Yan strained his eyes and attention to take it in. He crept up near  it. It took wing, and as it went he threw after it a short stick he  was carrying. The stick whirled over and struck the bird. It fell  fluttering. Yan rushed wildly after it and caught it in spite of his  mother's calling him back.    He came with the bird in his hand, but it did not live many minutes.  His mother was grieved and disgusted. She said. \"So this is the great  love you have for the wild things; the very first spring bird to sing  you must club to death. I do not understand your affections. Are not  two sparrows sold for one farthing, and yet not one of them falls to  the ground without the knowledge of your heavenly Father.\"    Yan was crushed. He held the dead bird in his hand and said,  contradictorily, as the tears stood in his eyes, \"I wish I hadn't; but  oh, it was so beautiful.\"    He could not explain, because he did not understand, and yet was no  hypocrite.    Weeks later a cheap trip gave him the chance for the first time in his  life to see Niagara. As he stood with his mother watching the racing  flood, in the gorge below the cataract, he noticed straws, bubbles and  froth, that seemed to be actually moving upstream. He said:    \"Mother, you see the froth how it seems to go up-stream.\"    \"Well!\"    \"Yet we know it is a trifle and means nothing. We know that just below  the froth is the deep, wide, terrible, irresistible, arrowy flood,  surging all the other way.\"    \"Yes, my son.\"    \"Well, Mother, when I killed the Shore-lark, that was froth going the  wrong way, I did love the little bird. I know now why I killed it.  Because it was going away from me. If I could have seen it near and  could have touched it, or even have heard it every day, I should never  have wished to harm it. I didn't mean _to kill it_, only _to  get it_. You gather flowers because you love to keep them near you,  not because you want to destroy them. They die and you are sorry. I  only tried to gather the Shore-lark as you would a flower. It died,  and I was very, very sorry.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" the mother replied, \"the merciful man is merciful unto  his beast. He who hearkens when the young Ravens cry, surely took note  of it, and in His great Book of Remembrance it is written down against  you.\"    And from that time they surely drifted apart.              PART II    SANGER & SAM          I    The New Home      Yan was now fourteen years old long-legged, thin, and growing fast The  doctor marked this combination and said: \"Send him on a farm for a  year.\"    Thus it was that an arrangement was made for Yan to work for his board  at the farmhouse of William Raften of Sanger.    Sanger was a settlement just emerging from the early or backwoods  period.    The recognized steps are, first, the frontier or woods where all  is unbroken forest and Deer abound; next the backwoods where small  clearings appear; then a settlement where the forest and clearings are  about equal and the Deer gone; last, an agricultural district, with  mere shreds of forest remaining.    Thirty years before, Sanger had been \"taken up\" by a population  chiefly from Ireland, sturdy peasantry for "]]]
