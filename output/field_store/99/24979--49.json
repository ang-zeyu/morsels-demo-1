Where there is an active and painful inflammation of the prescapular  lymph glands and contiguous structures, in some cases of \"levator-humeri  abscess,\" the scapulohumeral joint is extended. This is brought about by  flexion of the elbow and carpal joints.    There are some cases of bi-lateral affections which occasion such pain  during weight-bearing that the subject shifts its weight from one  affected leg to the other; an example of this condition may be observed  in any acute case of gonitis which affects both patellar regions, making  it equally painful to bear the weight on either member.    A peculiar characteristic position is assumed in acute laminitis of the  fore feet. In such instances, the hind feet are brought forward under  the body sufficiently to relieve the front feet of the weight, insofar  as is possible by the abnormal position taken in cases of acute  laminitis.    So in each position that is abnormal to any degree, assumed by a  suffering animal, there may be deduced, the fact that the subject is  attempting to relieve the affected structures, and in each clinical  picture of this kind, the trained diagnostician sees some index to the  nature and source of the trouble. Further examination is rendered more  effective because of this preliminary visual examination which has  precluded the unnecessary annoyance of the animal by manipulating  unaffected structures.    It has been presupposed in the foregoing, that the one making visual  examination of a lame animal for diagnostic purposes, will remember that  with the normal animal the weight is borne equally well with both fore  legs; and that this is done without shifting from one to the other; and  that the pelvic limbs do not support the body in this manner. Normal  subjects shift their weight from one hind leg to the other and the one  relaxed, rests in a state of flexion with the toe on the ground and the  heel raised.      Examination by Palpation.    In nearly every case where lameness exists an examination of the  affected parts, by palpation or by digital manipulation, is necessary  before an accurate conclusion may be drawn; but in making this kind of  an examination one needs to exercise good judgment lest he fail to  acquire a correct impression of the actual existent conditions. There is  need for the diagnostician, here, as well as in other conditions where  physical examination is made, to approach the subject in a manner that  will not excite or disturb to the extent that the animal will, in one  way or another, resist or object to the approach of the diagnostician,  thereby masking the symptoms sought. The practitioner would best acquire  skill as a horseman--if he is not possessed of such--and handle each  individual subject in the manner calculated to best suit the temperament  of the animal examined. The unbroken subject is not handled as  satisfactorily as is the intelligent family horse; in the former, in  some cases, little dependence is placed upon digital examination.    By palpation one is enabled to recognize hyperthermia and this, _in  lieu_ of dependable history, is at times sufficient evidence upon which  to determine the duration of any given inflammatory affection.    By comparison of different parts of the same member or with an analogous  portion of another member any marked increase in the apparently normal  temperature of a part at once signalizes inflammation. In this manner,  in examining a case where laminitis or other inflammation of the feet is  suspected, one may arrive at a fairly accurate conclusion without the  employment of other means. Throbbing vessels are not always easily  recognized if the subject is a victim of chronic lymphangitis.    In some instances, where a moderate degree of lameness exists and cause  is apparently obscure, the recognition of hyperthermia may be the  deciding factor in establishing a diagnosis. In cases of sprained  ligaments in the phalangeal region, because of the dense character of  the structures involved, little if any evidence of the cause of  lameness, other than local heat, may be found twenty-four hours after  the injury has been inflicted.    In order to determine the amount or extent of hyperthermia with a fair  degree of accuracy in any given case, one must make due allowance for  external conditions affecting temperature; also the effect of a  considerable amount of hair covering an area, as well as any possible  dirt contacting the surface of the skin must be taken into account. All  dirt should be removed if practicable, so that the diagnostician's palms  may come as nearly in contact with the inflamed structures as possible.  Then, too, the sense of touch if the operator's hands are chilled, is  not dependable. In such instances the novice will need to be deliberate  as to his findings--whether or not hyperthermia really exists. Such an  examination is of little value where the subject's feet are wet and an  examination is hurriedly made, as in cases of suspected laminitis.    Often, before being able to distinguish the presence of a hyperthermic  condition, one is impressed with the fact that an animal manifests  evidence of being supersensitive. In fact, some animals in the  anticipation of pain at the touch of an injured part, will instinctively  withdraw--in self-protection--such an ailing member or resist the  approach of the practitioner. This sensitiveness is more apparent in  animals that have been subjected to previous manipulation or treatment  which has occasioned pain, and consequently, allowance must be made for  this exhibition of fear. No better example of this condition can be  imagined than is present in cases of \"shoe boil,\" where there exists an  extensive area of acute inflammation of the elbow. There is always more  or less surface disturbance wherever vesication has been produced, and  in cases where irritants of any kind have been employed for several days  or a week previous to an examination, more or less supersensitiveness is  to be expected.    One must not lose sight of the fact that unscrupulous  dealers,--\"traders\"--make use of their knowledge of this principle in  various way usually for the purpose of attracting attention to a part,  which, presumably might have been blistered in order to intentionally  produce inflammation of tissues, in this way, causing lameness which is  not manifested until an animal has been kept by its new owner for  twenty-four hours or more. This, to be sure, usually makes a  dissatisfied purchaser who is willing to dispose of his newly acquired  animal at a sacrifice, thus enabling the original owner or his agent to  regain possession of the victimized animal at less than its real value.    Some nervous animals, because of the manner of approach of the  practitioner, are wont to flinch, and there is manifested a  pseudo-supersensitiveness. Young animals not accustomed to being handled  are likely to be timorous, and one must not hastily conclude that a part  is painful to the touch because the subject resents even gentle digital  manipulation of such parts. In instances of this kind, one needs to  compare sensibility by manipulation of different parts of the subject's  body in a careful and gentle manner; and by exercising patience and good  judgment in such work, it is possible to actually distinguish between  normal sensibility and abnormal sensitiveness, in most cases. Here,  again, the diagnostician needs to possess skill as a horseman and good  judgment as to individual temperament of different animals, under any  condition which may exist at the time he makes his examination.    By palpation alone, one can recognize the presence of fluctuating  enlargements; one may not only recognize such conditions, but  distinguish between a fluctuating mass such as exists in  non-strangulated hernia and a large fibrous tumor. By palpation, for the  recognition of density and for determining the presence or absence of  hyperthermia, one may decide that there exists an abscess and not a  tumor. Edematous swellings are recognized by palpation,--the  characteristic indentations which may be made in dropsical swellings are  pathognomonic indicators. In this manner it is easy to differentiate  post-operative or post-traumatic edemas which may or may not cause  lameness. At any rate, it is essential to take into account all  determinate conditions that may assist in the prognosis of any given  case, for the purpose of being able to outline rational remedial  measures. To be able to distinguish between the generalization of a  septic infection in its incipiency, and a more or less benign edema, is  largely possible by digital manipulation alone. An extremity may be  greatly swollen because of the existence of chronic lymphangitis,  influenza, or an acute septic infection occasioned by the introduction  of pathogenic and aerogenic organisms. Since the effect produced by  these dissimilar ailments are productive of conditions that may  terminate favorably or unfavorably, it becomes necessary for the  diagnostician to develop a trained, discriminating, tactile-digital  sense, in order to correctly interpret existing conditions, and handle  cases in a rational and skillful manner.    In order to ascertain the extent and exact location of a tumor, an  exostosis, or other enlargements, the diagnostician, here also, needs to  be in possession of a trained tactile sense and in addition if he be  fortified with an accurate knowledge of normal anatomy and pathology, he  is able to arrive at proper conclusions, when digital manipulations have  been employed. Fibrous tumors are sometimes located in the inferior part  of the medial side of the tarsus--exactly over the seat of bone-spavin.  Such tumors, when the affected member is supporting weight, are not to  be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#9)"],[1,"proof),      5 pints.  Rose-water,                             1 pint.    Mix and distil five pints for sale. Such essence of lavender is  expensive, but at 10_s._ a pint of 14 oz! there _is_ a margin for  profit. It not being convenient to the general dealer to sell distilled  lavender essence, the following form, by mixture, will produce a  first-rate article, and nearly as white as the above.    ESSENCE OF LAVENDER.    Otto of lavender,          3-1/2 oz.  Rectified spirit,          2 quarts.    The perfumer's retail price for such quality is 8_s._ per pint of 14 oz.    Many perfumers and druggists in making lavender water or essence, use a  small portion of bergamot, with an idea of improving its quality--a very  erroneous opinion; moreover, such lavender quickly discolors.    LAVENDER WATER.--Take:    English oil of lavender,      4 oz.  Spirit,                   3 quarts.  Rose-water,                 1 pint.    Filter as above, and it is ready for sale.    COMMON LAVENDER WATER.--Same form as the above, substituting  French lavender for the British.    Recipes for Rondeletia, Lavender Bouquet, and other lavender compounds,  will be given when we come to speak of compound perfumes, which will be  reserved until we have finished explaining the method of making the  simple essences.    LEMON.--This fine perfume is abstracted from the _Citrus  limonum_, by expression, from the rind of the fruit. The otto of lemons  in the market is principally from Messina, where there are hundreds of  acres of \"lemon groves.\" Otto of lemons, like all the ottos of the  Citrus family, is rapidly prone to oxidation when in contact with air  and exposure to light; a high temperature is also detrimental, and as  such is the case it should be preserved in a cool cellar. Most of the  samples from the gas-heated shelves of the druggists' shops, are as much  like essence of turpentine, to the smell, as that of lemons; rancid oil  of lemons may, in a great measure, be purified by agitation with warm  water and final decantation. When new and good, lemon otto may be freely  used in combination with rosemary, cloves, and caraway, for perfuming  powders for the nursery. From its rapid oxidation, it should not be used  for perfuming grease, as it assists rather than otherwise all fats to  turn rancid; hence pomatums so perfumed will not keep well. In the  manufacture of other compound perfumes, it should be dissolved in  spirit, in the proportion of six to eight ounces of oil to one gallon of  spirit. There is a large consumption of otto of lemons in the  manufacture of Eau de Cologne; that Farina uses it is easily discovered  by adding a few drops of Liq. Ammoniae fort. to half an ounce of his Eau  de Cologne, the smell of the lemon is thereby brought out in a  remarkable manner.    Perhaps it is not out of place here to remark, that in attempts to  discover the composition of certain perfumes, we are greatly assisted by  the use of strong Liq. Ammoniae. Certain of the essential oils combining  with the Ammonia, allow those which do not do so, if present in the  compound, to be smelt.    LEMON GRASS.--According to Pereira, the otto in the market  under this name is derived from the _Andropogon schoenanthus_ a  species of grass which grows abundantly in India. It is cultivated to a  large extent in Ceylon and in the Moluccas purposely for the otto, which  from the plant is easily procured by distillation. Lemon grass otto, or,  as it is sometimes called, oil of verbena, on account of its similarity  of odor to that favorite plant, is imported into this country in old  English porter and stout bottles. It is very powerful, well adapted for  perfuming soaps and greases, but its principal consumption is in the  manufacture of artificial essence of verbena. From its comparatively low  price, great strength, and fine perfume (when diluted), the lemon grass  otto may be much more used than at present, with considerable advantage  to the retail shopkeeper.    LILAC.--The fragrance of the flowers of this ornamental shrub  is well known. The essence of lilac is obtained either by the process of  maceration, or enfleurage with grease, and afterwards treating the  pomatum thus formed with rectified spirit, in the same manner as  previously described for cassie; the odor so much resembles tubereuse,  as to be frequently used to adulterate the latter, the demand for  tubereuse being at all times greater than the supply. A beautiful  IMITATION OF ESSENCE OF WHITE LILAC may be compounded thus:--    Spirituous extract from tubereuse pomade,            1 pint.            \"        of orange-flower pomade,        1/4 \"  Otto of almonds,                                    3 drops.  Extract of civet,                                    1/2 oz.    The civet is only used to give permanence to the perfume of the  handkerchief.    LILY.--The manufacturing perfumer rejects the advice of the  inspired writer, to \"consider the lilies of the field.\" Rich as they are  in odor, they are not cultivated for their perfume. If lilies are thrown  into oil of sweet almonds, or ben oil, they impart to it their sweet  smell; but to obtain anything like fragrance, the infusion must be  repeated a dozen times with the same oil, using fresh flowers for each  infusion, after standing a day or so. The oil being shaken with an equal  quantity of spirit for a week, gives up its odor to the alcohol, and  thus extract of lilies _may_ be made. But how it _is_ made is thus:--    IMITATION \"LILY OF THE VALLEY.\"    Extract of tubereuse,        1/2 pint.     \"       jasmine,              1 oz.     \"       fleur d'orange,       2 oz.     \"       vanilla,              3 oz.     \"       cassie,           1/4 pint.     \"       rose,             1/4  \"  Otto of almonds,              3 drops.    Keep this mixture together for a month, and then bottle it for sale. It  is a perfume that is very much admired.    MACE.--Ground mace is used in the manufacture of some of those  scented powders called Sachets. A strong-smelling essential oil may be  procured from it by distillation, but it is rarely used.    MAGNOLIA.--The perfume of this flower is superb; practically,  however, it is of little use to the manufacturer, the large size of the  blossoms and their comparative scarcity prevents their being used, but a  very excellent imitation of its odor is made as under, and is that which  is found in the perfumers' shops of London and Paris.    IMITATION \"ESSENCE OF MAGNOLIA.\"    Spirituous extract of orange-flower pomatum,      1 pint.        \"       \"       rose pomatum,              2 pints.        \"       \"       tubereuse pomatum,        1/2 pint.        \"       \"       violet pomatum,           1/2 \"  Essential oil of citron,                           3 drs.        \"       \"  almonds,                       10 drops.    MARJORAM.--The otto procured by distilling _Origanum majorana_,  commonly called oil of oringeat by the French, is exceedingly powerful,  and in this respect resembles all the ottos from the different species  of thyme, of which the marjoram is one. One hundred weight of the dry  herb yields about ten ounces of the otto. Oringeat oil is extensively  used for perfuming soap, but more in France than in England. It is the  chief ingredient used by Gelle Freres, of Paris, for scenting their  \"Tablet Monstre Soap,\" so common in the London shops.    MEADOW SWEET.--A sweet-smelling otto can be produced by  distilling the _Spiraea ulmaria_, but it is not used by perfumers.    MELISSA. See BALM.    MIGNONETTE.--But for the exquisite odor of this little flower,  it would scarcely be known otherwise than as a weed. Sweet as it is in  its natural state, and prolific in odor, we are not able to maintain its  characteristic smell as an essence. Like many others, during separation  from the plant, the fragrance is more or less modified; though not  perfect, it still reminds the sense of the odor of the flowers. To give  it that sweetness which it appears to want, a certain quantity of  violet is added to bring it up to the market odor.    As this plant is so very prolific in odor, we think something might be  done with it in England, especially as it flourishes as well in this  country as in France; and we desire to see Flower Farms and organized  Perfumatories established in the British Isles, for the extraction of  essences and the manufacture of pomade and oils, of such flowers as are  indigenous, or that thrive in the open fields of our country. Besides  opening up a new field of enterprise and good investment for capital, it  would give healthy employment to many women and children. Open air  employment for the young is of no little consideration to maintain the  stamina of the future generation; for it cannot be denied that our  factory system and confined cities are prejudicial to the physical  condition of the human family.    To return from our digression. The essence of mignonette, or, as it is  more often sold under the name of Extrait de Rezeda, is prepared by  infusing the rezeda pomade in rectified spirit, in the proportion of one  pound of pomade to one pint of spirit, allowing them to digest together  for a fortnight, when the essence is filtered off the pomade. One ounce  of extrait d'ambre is added to every pint. This is done to give  permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief, and does not in any way  alter its odor.    MIRIBANE.--The French name for artificial essence of almond  (see ALMOND).    MINT.--All the _Menthidae_ yield fragrant ottos by  distillation. The otto of the spear-mint (_M. viridis_) is exceedingly  powerful, and very valuable for perfuming soap, in conjunction with  other perfumes. Perfumers use the ottos of the mint in the manufacture  of mouth-washes and dental liquids. The leading ingredient in the  celebrated \"eau Botot\" is oil of peppermint in alcohol. A good imitation  may be made thus:--    EAU DE BOTOT.    Tincture of cedar wood,      1 pint.    "]]]
