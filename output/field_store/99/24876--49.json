The true art of using words is to put full and  clear meaning into a few of them; to say as much as possible with as  few words as you may select.    Tones may be treated in the same manner as words. One can write tones  in such a manner as to say quite as senseless a thing as \"Well day are  to you!\" Many do. This teaches you that true and simple  tone-sentences, like similar word-sentences, must have for their  object to say the fullest and clearest meaning in as little space as  possible.    For many hundreds of years thoughtful composers have studied about  this. They have tried in every way to discover the secrets underlying  tone-writing so that the utmost meaning should come out when they are  united. Tones thus arranged according to the laws of music-writing  make sense. To learn this art all great composers have studied  untiringly. They have recognized the difficulty of putting much  meaning in little space, and to gain this ability they have found no  labor to be too severe.    We must remember that there is no end of music in the world which was  not written by the few men whom we usually call the great composers.  Perhaps you will be interested to know about these works. Many of them  are really good--your favorite pieces, no doubt. When we think of it,  it is with composers as with trees of the forest. Great and small,  strong and weak, grow together for the many purposes for which they  are created. They could not all be either great or small. There must  be many kinds; then the young in time take the place of the old, and  the strong survive the weak. Together beneath the same sky,  deep-rooted in the beautiful, bountiful earth, they grow side by side.  The same sun shines upon them all, the same wind and the same rain  come to them, selecting no one before another. What are they all  doing? Each living its true life, as best it can. It is true they may  not come and go, they may not choose, but as we see them, beautiful in  their leaves and branches we feel the good purpose to which they live  and, unconsciously, perhaps, we love them.    Among us it is quite the same. Some are more skilful than others. But  be our skill great or small, we are not truly using it until we have  devoted it to a worthy purpose. And as with us, so it is with the  musicians. There are the great and small. The great ones--leaders of  thought--we call the great masters. The lesser are earnest men, who  have not as much power as the masters, but they are faithful in small  things.    They sing lesser songs it is true, but not less beautiful ones. Often  these lesser ones think more as we do. They think simply and about the  things which we have often in our minds. It is such thoughts as these  which we have in our best moments that we love so much when we see  them well expressed by one who is a good and delicate writer, either  of tones or words. Particularly do we understand these thoughts well  in the first years of our music when nearly all the works of the  greater composers are above us.    Thus are the many composers (who yet are not great masters) of value  to us because they write well a kind of thought which is pure and full  of meaning, and which we can understand. They give us true pleasure  day after day in the beginning and seem at the same time to help us  onward to the ability of understanding the great masters. This they do  by giving our thought training in the right direction.    Now, we know that the very best music for a young musician to learn in  the first days is that of the lesser tone masters, together with those  simpler pieces of the great composers which come within his power to  comprehend--within the power of a child's hands and voice. Let us see,  once again, if it is not clear:    True composers, great and small, sing from the heart. If one having a  little skill turn it unworthily away from the good and true work he  might do, then he does not use rightly his one talent. He does not  give us true thought in tone. He writes for vanity or a low purpose,  and is not a lesser master but he is untrue.    It is not our right to play anything. We may rightly play only that  which is full of such good thought as we in our power may understand.  It is to supply us with just this that the lesser masters write. In  simple, yet clear and beautiful pictures, they tell us many and many a  secret of the world of tone into which we shall some day be welcomed  by the greater ones if we are faithful unto the lesser.          CHAPTER XIV.    HARMONY AND COUNTERPOINT.        \"Whilst I was in Florence, I did my utmost to learn the exquisite     manner of Michaelangelo, and never once lost sight of     it.\"--_Benvenuto Cellini._[43]    On any important music subject Schumann has something to say. So with  this:    \"Learn betimes the fundamental principles of harmony.\" \"Do not be  afraid of the words theory, thorough-bass, and the like, they will  meet you as friends if you will meet them so.\"    We now begin to feel how definitely these rules treat everything. They  pick out the important subjects and tell the simplest truth about  them. The meaning of these two rules is this: From the beginning we  must try to understand the grammar of music. Some of the great  composers could in childhood write down music with the greatest  fluency. Handel, even as a boy, wrote a new church composition for  every Sunday. Mozart began to write music when less than five years  old, and when he was yet a boy, in Rome, he wrote down a  composition,[44] sung by the choir of the Sistine Chapel, which was  forbidden to the public.    Harmony and counterpoint stand to music very much as spelling and  grammar stand to language. They are the fundamentals of good writing  and of good--that is, of correct--thinking in music. Harmony is the  art of putting tones together so as correctly to make chords.  Counterpoint has to do with composing and joining together simple  melodies. A modern writer[45] on counterpoint has said: \"The essence  of true counterpoint lies in the equal interest which should belong to  ever part.\" By examining a few pieces of good counterpoint you will  readily see just what this means. The composer has not tried to get  merely a correct chord succession, such as we find in a choral. Let us  play a choral; any good one of a German master will do.[46] We notice  that the soprano is the principal part, and that the other voices,  while somewhat melodic, tend rather to support and follow the melody  than to be independent. If, now, we play a piece of counterpoint like  the G-Minor Prelude by Bach,[47] we shall have quite a good piece of  counterpoint, as far as separate melodies being combined is concerned.  Let us play the voice-parts separately. We shall find equal melodic  interest in each. The chords grow out of the music. Comparing this  with the choral, the main difference between harmony and counterpoint  should be clear to us. We shall observe that the three voices do _not_  proceed in the same way. If one part moves quickly, as in the bass of  the first two measures, the other parts are quieter; if the bass  ceases to move rapidly some other voice will take up the motion, as we  see in the third and following measures. As a general thing no two  voices in contrapuntal writing move in the same way, each voice-part  being contrasted with different note-values. This gives greater  interest and makes each voice stand forth independently.    At first contrapuntal music may not seem interesting to us. If that is  so, it is because we are not in the least degree conscious of the  wonderful interest which has been put into every part. The truth is,  that in the beginning we cannot fully understand the thought that has  been put into the music, but by perseverance it will come to us little  by little. This is what makes great music lasting. It is so deftly  made, yet so delicately, that we have to go patiently in search of it.  We must remember that gems have to be cut and polished from a bit of  rock.    In this case the gem is the rich mind-picture which comes to us if we  faithfully seek the under-thought. And the seeking is polishing the  gem.    Music written entirely by the rules of counterpoint is called  contrapuntal music; that written otherwise is known as free harmonic  music. In the one case the composer desired to have a beautiful  weaving of the parts--clear as the lines in a line-engraving. In the  other, the intention is to get effects from tones united into chords,  such as is obtained from masses of color in a painting. Neither form  may be said to be the superior of the other. Each is valuable in its  place, and each has possibilities peculiarly its own, which the other  could not give. Pure counterpoint could not give us such a charming  effect as Chopin obtains in the first study of Opus 10; nor could the  plainer and more free harmonic style give us such delicate bits of  tracery as Bach has in his fugues.    If now you will take the trouble to learn two long words, later in  your study of music they will be of use to you. The first is  Polyphonic; the other is Monophonic. Both, like many other words in  our language, are made up of two shorter words, and come from another  language--Greek. In both we have \"phonic,\" evidently meaning the same  in each case, limited or modified by the preceding part--_poly_ and  _mono_. Phonic is the Anglicized Greek for _sound_. We use it in the  English word _telephonic_. Now if we define mono and poly we shall  understand these two long words.    Mono means one, poly means many. We say _mono_tone, meaning one tone;  also _poly_gon, meaning many sides.    In the musical reference monophonic music means music of one voice,  rather than of one tone, and polyphonic music is that _for many  voices_. Simple melodies with or without accompanying chords are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#9)"],[1,", his eye, though faded, mild,    And childhood's sweet expression on his face.    The prince stopped short before him, bending low,    And gently asked: \"What would my father have?    Speak freely--what I can, I freely give.\"    \"Most noble prince, I need no charity,    For my kind neighbors give me all unasked,    And my poor cottage where my fathers dwelt,    And where my children and their mother died,    Is kept as clean as when sweet Gunga lived;    And young and old cheer up my lonely hours,    And ask me much of other times and men.    For when your father's father was a child,    I was a man, as young and strong as you,    And my sweet Gunga your companion's age.    But O the mystery of life explain!    Why are we born to tread this little round,    To live, to love, to suffer, sorrow, die?    Why do the young like field-flowers bloom to fade?    Why are the strong like the mown grass cut down?    Why am I left as if by death forgot,    Left here alone, a leafless, fruitless trunk?    Is death the end, or what comes after death?    Often when deepest sleep shuts out the world,    The dead still seem to live, while life fades out;    And when I sit alone and long for light    The veil seems lifted, and I seem to see    A world of life and light and peace and rest,    No sickness, sin or sorrow, pain or death,    No helpless infancy or hopeless age.    But we poor Sudras cannot understand--    Yet from my earliest memory I've heard    That from this hill one day should burst a light,    Not for the Brahmans only, but for all.    And when you were a child I saw a sage    Bow down before you, calling you that light.    O noble, mighty prince! let your light shine,    That men no longer grope in dark despair!\"      He spoke, and sank exhausted on the ground.    They gently raised him, but his life was fled.    The prince gave one a well-filled purse and said:    \"Let his pile neither lack for sandal-wood    Or any emblem of a life well spent.\"    And when fit time had passed they bore him thence    And laid him on that couch where all sleep well,    Half hid in flowers by loving children brought,    A smile still lingering on his still, cold lips,    As if they just had tasted Gunga's kiss,    Soon to be kissed by eager whirling flames.      Just then two stately Brahmans proudly passed--    Passed on the other side, gathering their robes    To shun pollution from the common touch,    And passing said: \"The prince with Sudras talks    As friend to friend--but wisdom comes with years.\"      Silent and thoughtful then they homeward turned,    The prince deep musing on the old man's words;    \"'The veil is lifted, and I seem to see    A world of life and light and peace and rest.'    O if that veil would only lift for me    The mystery of life would be explained.\"    As they passed on through unfrequented streets,    Seeking to shun the busy, thoughtless throng,    Those other words like duty's bugle-call    Still ringing in his ears: \"Let your light shine,    That men no longer grope in dark despair\"--    The old sad thoughts, long checked by passing joys,    Rolling and surging, swept his troubled soul--    As pent-up waters, having burst their dams,    Sweep down the valleys and o'erwhelm the plains.      Just then an aged, angry voice cried out:    \"O help! they've stolen my jewels and my gold!\"    And from a wretched hovel by the way    An old man came, hated and shunned by all,    Whose life was spent in hoarding unused gold,    Grinding the poor, devouring widows' homes;    Ill fed, ill clad, from eagerness to save,    His sunken eyes glittering with rage and greed.    And when the prince enquired what troubled him:    \"Trouble enough,\" he said, \"my sons have fled    Because I would not waste in dainty fare    And rich apparel all my life has saved,    And taken all my jewels, all my gold.    Would that they both lay dead before my face!    O precious jewels!  O beloved gold!\"    The prince, helpless to soothe, hopeless to cure    This rust and canker of the soul, passed on,    His heart with all-embracing pity filled.    \"O deepening mystery of life!\" he cried,    \"Why do such souls in human bodies dwell--    Fitter for ravening wolves or greedy swine!    Just at death's door cursing his flesh and blood    For thievish greed inherited from him.    Is this old age, or swinish greed grown old?    O how unlike that other life just fled!    His youth's companions, wife and children, dead,    Yet filled with love for all, by all beloved,    With his whole heart yearning for others' good,    With his last breath bewailing others' woes.\"    \"My best beloved,\" said sweet Yasodhara,    Her bright eyes filled with sympathetic tears,    Her whole soul yearning for his inward peace,    \"Brood not too much on life's dark mystery--    Behind the darkest clouds the sun still shines.\"    \"But,\" said the prince, \"the many blindly grope    In sorrow, fear and ignorance profound,    While their proud teachers, with their heads erect,    Stalk boldly on, blind leaders of the blind.    Come care, come fasting, woe and pain for me,    And even exile from my own sweet home,    All would I welcome could I give them light.\"    \"But would you leave your home, leave me, leave all,    And even leave our unborn pledge of love,    The living blending of our inmost souls,    That now within me stirs to bid you pause?\"    \"Only for love of you and him and all!    O hard necessity!  O bitter cup!    But would you have me like a coward shun    The path of duty, though beset with thorns--    Thorns that must pierce your tender feet and mine?\"    Piercing the question as the sharpest sword;    Their love, their joys, tempted to say him nay.    But soon she conquered all and calmly said:    \"My love, my life, where duty plainly calls    I bid you go, though my poor heart must bleed,    And though my eyes weep bitter scalding tears.\"      Their hearts too full for words, too full for tears,    Gently he pressed her hand and they passed home;    And in the presence of this dark unknown    A deep and all-pervading tenderness    Guides every act and tempers every tone--    As in the chamber of the sick and loved    The step is light, the voice is soft and low.    But soon their days with varied duties filled,    Their nights with sweet repose, glide smoothly on,    Until this shadow seems to lift and fade--    As when the sun bursts through the passing storm,    Gilding the glittering raindrops as they fall,    And paints the bow of hope on passing clouds.    Yet still the old sad thoughts sometimes return,    The burden of a duty unperformed,    The earnest yearning for a clearer light.    The thought that hour by hour and day by day    The helpless multitudes grope blindly on,    Clouded his joys and often banished sleep.      One day in this sad mood he thought to see    His people as they are in daily life,    And not in holiday attire to meet their prince.    In merchant's dress, his charioteer his clerk,    The prince and Channa passed unknown, and saw    The crowded streets alive with busy hum,    Traders cross-legged, with their varied wares,    The wordy war to cheapen or enhance,    One rushing on to clear the streets for wains    With huge stone wheels, by slow strong oxen drawn;    Palanquin-bearers droning out \"Hu, hu, ho, ho,\"    While keeping step and praising him they bear;    The housewives from the fountain water bring    In balanced water-jars, their black-eyed babes    Athwart their hips, their busy tongues meanwhile    Engaged in gossip of the little things    That make the daily round of life to them;    The skillful weaver at his clumsy loom;    The miller at his millstones grinding meal;    The armorer, linking his shirts of mail;    The money-changer at his heartless trade;    The gaping, eager crowd gathered to watch    Snake-charmers, that can make their deadly charge    Dance harmless to the drone of beaded gourds;    Sword-players, keeping many knives in air;    Jugglers, and those that dance on ropes swung high:    And all this varied work and busy idleness    As in a panorama passing by.      While they were passing through these varied scenes,    The prince, whose ears were tuned to life's sad notes,    Whose eyes were quick to catch its deepest shades,    Found sorrow, pain and want, disease and death,    Were woven in its very warp and woof.    A tiger, springing from a sheltering bush,    Had snatched a merchant's comrade from his side;    A deadly cobra, hidden by the path,    Had stung to death a widow's only son;    A breath of jungle-wind a youth's blood chilled,    Or filled a strong man's bones with piercing pain;    A household widowed by a careless step;    The quick cross-lightning from an angry cloud    Struck down a bridegroom bringing home his bride--    All this and more he heard, and much he saw:    A young man, stricken in life's early prime,    Shuffled along, dragging one palsied limb,    While one limp arm hung useless by his side;    A dwarf sold little knickknacks by the way,    His body scarcely in the human form,    To which long arms and legs seemed loosely hung,    His noble head thrust forward on his breast,    Whose pale, sad face as plainly told as words    That life had neither health nor hope for him;    An old man tottering from a hovel came,    Frail, haggard, palsied, leaning on a staff,    Whose eyes, dull, glazed and meaningless, proclaim    The body lingers when the mind has fled;    One seized with sudden hot distemper of the blood,    Writhing with anguish, by the wayside sunk.    The purple plague-spot on his pallid cheek,    Cold drops of perspiration on his brow,    With wildly rolling eyes and livid lips,    Gasping for breath and feebly asking help--    But ere the prince could aid, death gave relief.      At length they passed the city's outer gate    And down a stream, now spread in shining pools,    Now leaping in cascades, now dashing on,    A line of foam"]]]
