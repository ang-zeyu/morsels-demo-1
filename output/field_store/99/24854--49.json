But the crime as well as the penalty belonged to the age, and  crimes legally said to be against the State mean morally very different  things, according to the state of society and opinion. It is an  unfairness verging on the ridiculous, when the ground is elaborately  laid for keeping up the impression that Essex was preparing a real  treason against the Queen like that of Norfolk. It was a treason of the  same sort and order as that for which Northumberland sent Somerset to  the block: the treason of being an unsuccessful rival.    Meanwhile Bacon had been getting gradually into the unofficial employ of  the Government. He had become one of the \"Learned Counsel\"--lawyers with  subordinate and intermittent work, used when wanted, but without patent  or salary, and not ranking with the regular law officers. The Government  had found him useful in affairs of the revenue, in framing  interrogatories for prisoners in the Tower, in drawing up reports of  plots against the Queen. He did not in this way earn enough to support  himself; but he had thus come to have some degree of access to the  Queen, which he represents as being familiar and confidential, though he  still perceived, as he says himself, that she did not like him. At the  first news of Essex's return to England, Bacon greeted him--         \"MY LORD,--Conceiving that your Lordship came now up in the person       of a good servant to see your sovereign mistress, which kind of       compliments are many times _instar magnorum meritorum_, and       therefore it would be hard for me to find you, I have committed to       this poor paper the humble salutations of him _that is more yours       than any man's, and more yours than any man_. To these salutations       I add a due and joyful gratulation, confessing that your Lordship,       in your last conference with me before your journey, spake not in       vain, God making it good, That you trusted we should say _Quis       putasset_! Which as it is found true in a happy sense, so I wish       you do not find another _Quis putasset_ in the manner of taking       this so great a service. But I hope it is, as he said, _Nubecula       est, cito transibit_, and that your Lordship's wisdom and       obsequious circumspection and patience will turn all to the best.       So referring all to some time that I may attend you, I commit you       to God's best preservation.\"    But when Essex's conduct in Ireland had to be dealt with, Bacon's  services were called for; and from this time his relations towards Essex  were altered. Every one, no one better than the Queen herself, knew all  that he owed to Essex. It is strangely illustrative of the time, that  especially as Bacon held so subordinate a position, he should have been  required, and should have been trusted, to act against his only and most  generous benefactor. It is strange, too, that however great his loyalty  to the Queen, however much and sincerely he might condemn his friend's  conduct, he should think it possible to accept the task. He says that he  made some remonstrance; and he says, no doubt truly, that during the  first stage of the business he used the ambiguous position in which he  was placed to soften Essex's inevitable punishment, and to bring about a  reconciliation between him and the Queen. But he was required, as the  Queen's lawyer, to set forth in public Essex's offences; and he admits  that he did so \"not over tenderly.\" Yet all this, even if we have  misgivings about it, is intelligible. If he had declined, he could not,  perhaps, have done the service which he assures us that he tried to do  for Essex; and it is certain that he would have had to reckon with the  terrible lady who in her old age still ruled England from the throne of  Henry VIII., and who had certainly no great love for Bacon himself. She  had already shown him in a much smaller matter what was the forfeit to  be paid for any resistance to her will. All the hopes of his life must  perish; all the grudging and suspicious favours which he had won with  such unremitting toil and patient waiting would be sacrificed, and he  would henceforth live under the wrath of those who never forgave. And  whatever he did for himself, he believed that he was serving Essex. His  scheming imagination and his indefatigable pen were at work. He tried  strange indirect methods; he invented a correspondence between his  brother and Essex, which was to fall into the Queen's hands in order to  soften her wrath and show her Essex's most secret feelings. When the  Queen proposed to dine with him at his lodge in Twickenham Park, \"though  I profess not to be a poet,\" he \"prepared a sonnet tending and alluding  to draw on her Majesty's reconcilement to my Lord.\" It was an awkward  thing for one who had been so intimate with Essex to be so deep in the  counsels of those who hated him. He complains that many people thought  him ungrateful and disloyal to his friend, and that stories circulated  to his disadvantage, as if he were poisoning the Queen's ear against  Essex. But he might argue fairly enough that, wilful and wrong-headed as  Essex had been, it was the best that he could now do for him; and as  long as it was only a question of Essex's disgrace and enforced absence  from Court, Bacon could not be bound to give up the prospects of his  life--indeed, his public duty as a subordinate servant of government--on  account of his friend's inexcusable and dangerous follies. Essex did not  see it so, and in the subjoined correspondence had the advantage; but  Bacon's position, though a higher one might be imagined, where men had  been such friends as these two men had been, is quite a defensible one:         \"MY LORD,--No man can better expound my doings than your Lordship,       which maketh me need to say the less. Only I humbly pray you to       believe that I aspire to the conscience and commendation first of       _bonus civis_, which with us is a good and true servant to the       Queen, and next of _bonus vir_, that is an honest man. I desire       your Lordship also to think that though I confess I love some       things much better than I love your Lordship--as the Queen's       service, her quiet and contentment, her honour, her favour, the       good of my country, and the like--yet I love few persons better       than yourself, both for gratitude's sake and for your own virtues,       which cannot hurt but by accident or abuse. Of which my good       affection I was ever ready and am ready to yield testimony by any       good offices, but with such reservations as yourself cannot but       allow; for as I was ever sorry that your Lordship should fly with       waxen wings, doubting Icarus's fortune, so for the growing up of       your own feathers, specially ostrich's, or any other save of a bird       of prey, no man shall be more glad. And this is the axletree       whereupon I have turned and shall turn, which to signify to you,       though I think you are of yourself persuaded as much, is the cause       of my writing; and so I commend your Lordship to God's goodness.       From Gray's Inn, this 20th day of July, 1600.         \"Your Lordship's most humbly,       \"FR. BACON.\"    To this letter Essex returned an answer of dignified reserve, such as  Bacon might himself have dictated--         \"MR. BACON,--I can neither expound nor censure your late actions,       being ignorant of all of them, save one, and having directed my       sight inward only, to examine myself. You do pray me to believe       that you only aspire to the conscience and commendation of _bonus       civis_ and _bonus vir_; and I do faithfully assure you, that while       that is your ambition (though your course be active and mine       contemplative), yet we shall both _convenire in codem tertio_ and       _convenire inter nosipsos_. Your profession of affection and offer       of good offices are welcome to me. For answer to them I will say       but this, that you have believed I have been kind to you, and you       may believe that I cannot be other, either upon humour or my own       election. I am a stranger to all poetical conceits, or else I       should say somewhat of your poetical example. But this I must say,       that I never flew with other wings than desire to merit and       confidence in my Sovereign's favour; and when one of these wings       failed me I would light nowhere but at my Sovereign's feet, though       she suffered me to be bruised with my fall. And till her Majesty,       that knows I was never bird of prey, finds it to agree with her       will and her service that my wings should be imped again, I have       committed myself to the mire. No power but my God's and my       Sovereign's can alter this resolution of         \"Your retired friend,       \"ESSEX.\"    But after Essex's mad attempt in the city a new state of things arose.  The inevitable result was a trial for high treason, a trial of which no  one could doubt the purpose and end. The examination of accomplices  revealed speeches, proposals, projects, not very intelligible to us in  the still imperfectly understood game of intrigue that was going on  among all parties at the end of Elizabeth's reign, but quite enough to  place Essex at the mercy of the Government and the offended Queen. \"The  new information,\" says Mr. Spedding, \"had been immediately communicated  to Coke and Bacon.\" Coke, as Attorney-General, of course conducted the  prosecution; and the next prominent person on the side of the Crown was  not the Solicitor, or any other regular law officer, but Bacon, though  holding the very subordinate place of one of the \"Learned Counsel.\"    It does not appear that he thought it strange, that he showed any pain  or reluctance, that he sought to be excused. He took it as a matter of  course. The part assigned to Bacon in the prosecution was as important  as that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#9)"],[1,"purposes.    And in the interest of humanity and to aid in preserving the lives of  the starving people of the island I recommend that the distribution of  food and supplies be continued and that an appropriation be made out of  the public Treasury to supplement the charity of our citizens.    The issue is now with the Congress. It is a solemn responsibility.  I have exhausted every effort to relieve the intolerable condition of  affairs which is at our doors. Prepared to execute every obligation  imposed upon me by the Constitution and the law, I await your action.    Yesterday, and since the preparation of the foregoing message, official  information was received by me that the latest decree of the Queen  Regent of Spain directs General Blanco, in order to prepare and  facilitate peace, to proclaim a suspension of hostilities, the duration  and details of which have not yet been communicated to me.    This fact, with every other pertinent consideration, will, I am sure,  have your just and careful attention in the solemn deliberations upon  which you are about to enter. If this measure attains a successful  result, then our aspirations as a Christian, peace-loving people will be  realized. If it fails, it will be only another justification for our  contemplated action.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.

WILLIAM McKINLEY.        DEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington_, _April 11, 1898_.    The PRESIDENT:    The Secretary of State has had the honor to receive, by reference from  the President, a resolution adopted in the Senate of the United States  on the 14th of February last, reading as follows:    \"_Resolved,_ That the President is requested, if in his opinion it  is not incompatible with the public service, to send to the Senate  copies of the reports of the consul-general and of the consuls of the  United States in Cuba written or received since March 4, 1897, which  relate to the state of war in that island and the condition of the  people there, or that he will send such parts of said reports as will  inform the Senate as to these facts.    \"Second. That the President inform the Senate whether any agent of a  government in Cuba has been accredited to this Government or the  President of the United States with authority to negotiate a treaty of  reciprocity with the United States, or any other diplomatic or  commercial agreement with the United States, and whether such person has  been recognized and received as the representative of such government in  Cuba.\"    This resolution contemplates answer being made to two separable  inquiries: First, in relation to the present condition of affairs in  Cuba, and, secondly, with regard to the action had in view of the  overtures of the Government of Spain for a reciprocal commercial  agreement covering particularly the trade between the United States and  the island of Cuba.    The conduct of commercial negotiations under the authority and in  accordance with the conditions found in sections 3, 4, and 5 of the  existing tariff act, approved July 24, 1897, having been intrusted to a  special commissioner plenipotentiary duly empowered by the President to  that end, it has been deemed convenient to leave to the commissioner the  preparation of a report in answer to the second part of the Senate  resolution, the undersigned reserving to himself the response to the  first part thereof, which concerns the political and consular functions  of the Department of State. The separate report of the Hon. John A.  Kasson, special commissioner plenipotentiary, is therefore herewith  independently submitted to the President with a view to its transmission  to the Senate, should such a course be, in the President's judgment, not  incompatible with the public service.    The Senate resolution, while in terms calling for the submission to that  honorable body of all or of a practical selection of the reports of the  consul-general and consuls of the United States in Cuba written or  received since March 4, 1897, which relate to the state of war in that  island and the condition of the people there, appears to leave it to the  discretion of the President to direct the scope of the information to be  so reported and the manner of its communication. The undersigned, having  taken the President's direction on both these points, has the honor to  lay before him a selection of the correspondence received by the  Department of State from the various consular representatives in Cuba,  aiming thereby to show the present situation in the island rather than  to give a historical account of all the reported incidents since the  date assigned by the resolution.    Respectfully submitted.    JOHN SHERMAN.        DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON,    _Office of Special Commissioner Plenipotentiary_.    The PRESIDENT:    In response to the following resolution of the Senate, passed under date  of February 14, 1898, and which was referred to the undersigned for  report, viz--    \"Second. That the President inform the Senate whether any agent of  a government in Cuba has been accredited to this Government or the  President of the United States with authority to negotiate a treaty  of reciprocity with the United States, or any other diplomatic or  commercial agreement with the United States, and whether such person has  been recognized and received as the representative of such government  in Cuba\"--    I have the honor to submit the following report:    In October, 1897, the minister of Spain at this capital verbally advised  the undersigned that so soon as the new government in Spain had leisure  to take up the question he would probably be authorized to enter into  negotiations with the undersigned for reciprocal trade arrangements with  Spain, and that a representative of Cuba would probably be associated  for the interests of that island.    Under date of December 9, 1897, the minister of the United States at  Madrid was instructed to ascertain the disposition of the Spanish  Government in respect to these negotiations.    Under date of January 24, 1898, a dispatch from Mr. Woodford (referred  to this office) advised the Secretary of State that arrangements were  made for the negotiation of a commercial treaty between Spain and the  United States; that separate provisions would be made for Cuba, and that  the Cuban insular government would appoint a delegate to represent that  island in the negotiations. This was accompanied by a memorandum from  the Spanish minister of colonies, stating that the same rules as for  Cuba might be applied to Puerto Rico, and suggesting a basis for the  negotiations. This communication was referred to this office on the 4th  of February.    On the 6th of February the Spanish minister, Mr. Dupuy de Lome, called  on the undersigned and announced that he was authorized to represent  Spain in the pending negotiations and that a special representative  would arrive from Cuba, under appointment of the insular government, to  act as far as the interests of that island were involved. He mentioned  the name of Senor Angulo as the gentleman who had been suggested in Cuba  for that appointment; but the delegate was not officially notified to  this office.    On March 17 a note from the Spanish minister, Senor Polo y Bernabe,  addressed, under date of the 16th instant, to the Secretary of State,  was referred to this office. In that note his excellency advised this  Government of his appointment by Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain  to conduct these negotiations, assisted by Senor Manuel Rafael Angulo as  special delegate of the insular government of Cuba, who would be aided  by two technical assistants, also appointed by the Cuban government;  and, further, that an officer from the treasury department would be  added in the same character.    His excellency announced his readiness to commence the labors of the  commission so soon as the Government of the United States should  formulate the general plan for carrying on the work.    Respectfully submitted, March 17, 1898.    JOHN A KASSON,    _Special Commissioner Plenipotenitary_.        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 12, 1898_.    _To the Senate of the United States:_    In response to a resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant, I inclose  herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, inclosing a copy of a  report from the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.        NAVY DEPARTMENT, _Washington, April 9, 1898_.    The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.    SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Senate resolution of  April 4, directing that the Senate be informed \"of the total number of  human lives that were lost by the sinking of the United States battle  ship _Maine_ in Havana Harbor, Cuba, on the 15th day of February,  1898, the total number of dead bodies rescued from said ship, the total  number remaining unrescued, and what effort, if any, is being made to  rescue them,\" and in reply thereto inclose a copy of a report from the  Chief of the Bureau of Navigation covering the above inquiry. I have the  honor to be, sir, very respectfully,    JOHN D. LONG, _Secretary_.        MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY.   "]]]
