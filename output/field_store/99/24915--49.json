He recoiled from materialism, finding that it offered no explanation  of the universe. Faith in God he had never entirely lost, and on  that he founded his henceforth unshaken belief in the providential  government of the world. Whatever might be the origin of the  Christian religion, it furnished the best guide of life; and  spiritual truth, as Bunsen said, was independent of history. He had  no sort of sympathy with those who rejected belief in Christianity  altogether, still less with those who abandoned Theism. Although he  could not be a minister of the Church, he was content to be a  member, understanding the Church to be what he was brought up to  think it, the national organ of religion, a Protestant, evangelical  establishment under the authority of the law and the supremacy of  the Crown.    Froude returned to Manchester immediately after his marriage, but  his wife did not like the place nor the people. They looked about  for a country home, and were fortunate enough to find the most  enchanting spot in North Wales. Plas Gwynant, the shining place,  stands on a rising ground surrounded by woods, at the foot of  Snowdon, between Capel Curig and Beddgelert. Beyond the lawn and  meadow is Dinas Lake. A cherry orchard stood close to the house  door, and a torrent poured through a rocky ravine in the grounds,  falling into a pool below. A mile up the valley was the glittering  lake, Lyn Gwynant, with a boat and plenty of fishing. Good shooting  was also within reach.    To this ideal home Froude came with his wife in the summer of 1850.  Here began a new life of cloudless happiness and perfect peace. His  spiritual difficulties fell away from him, and he found that the  Church in which he had been born was comprehensive enough for him,  as for others. He was not called upon to solve problems which had  baffled the subtlest intellects, and would baffle them till the end  of time. Religion could be made practical, and not until its  practical lessons had been exhausted was it necessary to go farther  afield. \"Do the duty that lies nearest you,\" said Goethe, who knew  art and science, literature and life, as few men have known them.  Froude was never idle, and never at a loss for amusement. Although  he wrote regularly, and his love of reading was a passion, he had  the keenest enjoyment of sport and expeditions, of country air and  sights and sounds, of natural beauty and physical exercise. It was  impossible to be dull in his company, for he was the prince of  conversers, drawing out as much as he gave. No wonder that there  were numerous visitors at Plas Gwynant. He was the best and warmest  of friends. In London he would always lay aside his work for the day  to entertain one of his contemporaries at Oxford, and at Plas  Gwynant they found a hospitable welcome. He would fish with them, or  shoot with them, or boat with them, or walk with them, discussing  every subject under heaven. Perhaps the most valued of his guests  was Clough, who had then written most of his poetry, and projected  new enterprises, not knowing how short his life would be.    Besides Clough, Matthew Arnold came to Plas Gwynant, and Charles  Kingsley, and John Conington, the Oxford Professor of Latin, and Max  Muller, the great philologist. A letter to Max Muller, dated the  25th of June, 1851, gives a pleasant picture of existence there.    \"I shall be so glad to see you in July. Come and stay as long as  work will let you, and you can endure our hospitality. We are poor,  and so are not living at a high rate. I can't give you any wine,  because I haven't a drop in the house, and you must bring your own  cigars, as I am come down to pipes. But to set against that, you  shall have the best dinner in Wales every day--fresh trout, Welsh  mutton, as much bitter ale as you can drink; a bedroom and a little  sitting-room joining it all for your own self, and the most  beautiful look-out from the window that I have ever seen. You may  vary your retirement. You may change your rooms for the flower-  garden, which is an island in the river, or for the edge of the  waterfall, the music of which will every night lull you to sleep.  Last of all, you will have the society of myself, and of my wife,  and, what ought to weigh with you too, you will give us the great  pleasure of yours.\"    Clough neither fished, nor shot, nor boated, but as a walking  companion there was no one, in Froude's opinion, to be put above  him. For fishing he gave pre-eminence to Kingsley, and together they  carried up their coracles to waters higher than ordinary boats could  reach. Kingsley was ardent in all forms of sport, and an enthusiast  for Maurician theology, holding, as he said, that it had pleased God  to show him and Maurice things which He had concealed from Carlyle.  He had concealed them also from Froude, who regarded Carlyle as his  teacher, feeling that he owed him his emancipation from clerical  bonds.    Froude and Kingsley did not agree either in theology or in politics.  \"I meant to say,\" Froude wrote to his wife's brother-in-law in 1851,  \"that the philosophical necessity of the Incarnation as a fact must  have been as cogent to the earliest thinkers as to ourselves. If we  may say it must have been, they might say so. And they might, and  indeed must, have concluded, each at their several date, that the  highest historical person known to them must have been the Incarnate  God; so that unless the Incarnation was the first fact in human  history, there must have been a time when they would have used the  argument and it would have led them wrong.\"    Concerning Kingsley's Socialism, especially as shown in Hypatia,  Froude was cold and critical. \"It is by no means as yet clear to  me,\" he wrote about this time, \"that all good people are Socialists,  and that therefore whoever sticks to the old thing is a bad fellow.  Whatever is has no end of claims on us. I have no doubt that we  could not get on without the devil. If it had not been so, he would  not have been. The ideas must be content to fight a long time before  they assimilate all the wholesome flesh in the universe, and we  cannot leave what works somehow for what only promises to work, and  has yet by no means largely realised that promise. I consider it a  bad sign in the thinkers among the Christian Socialists if they set  to cursing those who don't agree with them. The multitudes must, but  the thinkers should not. I cannot believe that if Clement of  Alexandria had been asked whether he candidly believed Tacitus was  damned because he was a heathen he would have said 'Yes.' Indeed, on  indifferent matters (supposing he had been alive in Tacitus's time),  I don't think he would have minded writing a leader in the Acta  Diurna, even though Tacitus followed on the other side!\"    Oxford, and its old clothes, Froude had cast behind him. He had  never taken priest's orders, and the clerical disabilities imposed  upon him were not only cruel, but ridiculous. Shut out from the law,  he turned to literature, and became a regular reviewer. There was  not so much reviewing then as there is now, but it was better paid.  His services were soon in great request, for he wrote an  incomparable style.    The origin of Froude's style is not obscure. Too original to be an  imitator, he was in his handling of English an apt pupil of Newman.  There is the same ease, the same grace, the same lightness of  elastic strength. Froude, like Newman, can pass from racy,  colloquial vernacular, the talk of educated men who understand each  other, to heights of genuine eloquence, where the resources of our  grand old English tongue are drawn out to the full. His vocabulary  was large and various. He was familiar with every device of  rhetoric. He could play with every pipe in the language, and sound  what stop he pleased. Oxford men used to talk very much in those  days, and have talked more or less ever since, about the Oriel  style. Perhaps the best example of it is Church, the accomplished  Dean of St. Paul's. Church does not rival Newman and Froude at their  best. But he never, as they sometimes do, falls into loose and  slipshod writing. He was the fine flower of the old Oxford  education, growing in hedged gardens, sheltered from the winds of  heaven, such as Catullus painted in everlasting colours long  centuries ago. Froude was a man of the world, who knew the classics,  and the minds of men, and cities, and governments, and the various  races which make up the medley of the universe. He wrote for the  multitude who read books for relaxation, who want to have their  facts clearly stated, and their thinking done for them. He satisfied  all their requirements, and yet he expressed himself with the  natural eloquence of a fastidious scholar. Lucky indeed were the  editors who could obtain the services of such a reviewer, and he was  fortunate in being able to recommend with power the poetry of his  friend, Matthew Arnold.*    --  * His recommendation was entirely sincere. \"Matt. A.'s Sohrab and  Rustum,\" he wrote to Clough, \"is to my taste all but perfect.\"  --    Although Froude enjoyed with avidity the conversation of his chosen  friends, he was not satisfied with intellectual epicureanism. He was  resolved to make for himself a name, to leave behind him some not  unworthy memorial. The history of the Reformation attracted him  strongly. If an historian is a man of science, or a mere chronicler,  then certainly Froude was not an historian. He made no claim to be  impartial. He held that the Oxford Movement was not only endangering  the National Church, but injuring the national character and  corrupting men's knowledge of the past. He believed in the  Reformation first as an historic fact, and secondly as a beneficent  revolt of the laity against clerical dominion. He denied that since  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14993"],[0,"Rig Veda Americanus (#9)"],[1,", to die, and _yecaui_, to                cease; \"to cease dying.\"  Mitoaya, I, 3.
