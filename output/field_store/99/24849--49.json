And thus in every contingency from which       there can be danger, there is also found the element of       safety.\" Yet, he added, \"All attempts to strengthen this       federal government at the expense of the States' governments       must be futile.... The federal government exists on       sufferance only. Any State may at any time constitutionally       withdraw from the Union, and thus virtually dissolve it[32].\"    Even more emphatically, though with less authority, wrote one Charles  Mackay, styled by the American press as a \"distinguished British poet,\"  who made the usual rapid tour of the principal cities of America in  1857-58, and as rapidly penned his impressions:         \"Many persons in the United States talk of a dissolution of       the Union, but few believe in it.... All this is mere bravado       and empty talk. It means nothing. The Union is dear to all       Americans, whatever they may say to the contrary.... There is       no present danger to the Union, and the violent expressions       to which over-ardent politicians of the North and South       sometimes give vent have no real meaning. The 'Great West,'       as it is fondly called, is in the position even now to       arbitrate between North and South, should the quarrel stretch       beyond words, or should anti-slavery or any other question       succeed in throwing any difference between them which it       would take revolvers and rifles rather than speeches and       votes to put an end to[33].\"    The slavery controversy in America had, in short, come to be regarded in  England as a constant quarrel between North and South, but of no  immediate danger to the Union. Each outbreak of violent American  controversy produced a British comment sympathetic with the North. The  turmoil preceding and following the election of Lincoln in 1860, on the  platform of \"no extension of slavery,\" was very generally noted by the  British press and public, as a sign favourable to the cause of  anti-slavery, but with no understanding that Southern threat would at  last be realized in definite action. Herbert Spencer, in a letter of May  15, 1862, to his American friend, Yeomans, wrote, \"As far as I had the  means of judging, the feeling here was at first _very decidedly_ on the  side of the North[34] ...\" The British metropolitan press, in nearly  every issue of which for at least two years after December, 1860, there  appeared news items and editorial comment on the American crisis, was at  first nearly unanimous in condemning the South[35]. The _Times_, with  accustomed vigour, led the field. On November 21, 1860, it stated:         \"When we read the speech of Mr. Lincoln on the subject of       Slavery and consider the extreme moderation of the sentiments       it expresses, the allowance that is made for the situation,       for the feelings, for the prejudices, of the South; when we       see how entirely he narrows his opposition to the single       point of the admission of Slavery into the Territories, we       cannot help being forcibly struck by the absurdity of       breaking up a vast and glorious confederacy like that of the       United States from the dread and anger inspired by the       election of such a man to the office of Chief Magistrate....       We rejoice, on higher and surer grounds, that it [the       election] has ended in the return of Mr. Lincoln. We are glad       to think that the march of Slavery, and the domineering tone       which its advocates were beginning to assume over Freedom,       has been at length arrested and silenced. We rejoice that a       vast community of our own race has at length given an       authoritative expression to sentiments which are entertained       by everyone in this country. We trust to see the American       Government employed in tasks more worthy of a State founded       on the doctrines of liberty and equality than the invention       of shifts and devices to perpetuate servitude; and we hear in       this great protest of American freedom the tardy echo of       those humane doctrines to which England has so long become a       convert.\"    Other leading journals, though with less of patronizing  self-complacency, struck the same note as the _Times_. The _Economist_  attributed Lincoln's election to a shift in the sympathies of the \"lower  orders\" in the electorate who had now deserted their former leaders, the  slave-owning aristocracy of the South, and allied themselves with the  refined and wise leaders of the North. Lincoln, it argued, was not an  extremist in any sense. His plan of action lay within the limits of  statesmanlike moderation[36]. The _Saturday Review_ was less sure that  England should rejoice with the North. British self-esteem had suffered  some hard blows at the hands of the Democratic party in America, but at  least England knew where Democrats stood, and could count on no more  discourtesy or injustice than that inflicted in the past. The Republican  party, however, had no policy, except that of its leader, Seward, and  from him might be expected extreme insolence[37]. This was a very early  judgment of Seward, and one upon which the _Saturday Review_ preened  itself later, as wholly justified. The _Spectator_, the only one of the  four journals thus far considered which ultimately remained constant in  advocacy of the Northern cause, was at first lukewarm in comment,  regarding the 1860 election, while fought on the slavery issue, as in  reality a mere contest between parties for political power[38].    Such was the initial attitude of the English press. Each press issue  for several weeks harped on the same chord, though sounding varying  notes. If the South really means forcible resistance, said the _Times_,  it is doomed to quick suppression. \"A few hundred thousand slave-owners,  trembling nightly with visions of murder and pillage, backed by a  dissolute population of 'poor whites,' are no match for the hardy and  resolute populations of the Free States[39],\" and if the South hoped for  foreign aid it should be undeceived promptly: \"Can any sane man believe  that England and France will consent, as is now suggested, to stultify  the policy of half a century for the sake of an extended cotton trade,  and to purchase the favours of Charleston and Milledgeville by  recognizing what has been called 'the isothermal law, which impels  African labour toward the tropics' on the other side of the  Atlantic[40]?\" Moreover all Americans ought to understand clearly that  British respect for the United States \"was not due to the attitude of  the South with its ruffian demonstrations in Congress.... All that is  noble and venerable in the United States is associated with its Federal  Constitution[41].\"    Did the British public hold these same opinions? There is no direct  evidence available in sufficient quantity in autobiography or letters  upon which to base a conclusion. Such works are silent on the struggle  in America for the first few months and presumably public opinion, less  informed even than the press, received its impressions from the journals  customarily read. Both at this period and all through the war, also, it  should be remembered, clearly, that most newspapers, all the reviews, in  fact nearly all vehicles of British expression, were in the early  'sixties \"in the hands of the educated classes, and these educated  classes corresponded closely with the privileged classes.\" The more  democratic element of British Society lacked any adequate press  representation of its opinions. \"This body could express itself by such  comparatively crude methods as public meetings and demonstrations, but  it was hampered in literary and political expression[42].\" The opinion  of the press was then, presumably, the opinion of the majority of the  educated British public.    Thus British comment on America took the form, at first of  moralizations, now severe toward the South, now indifferent, yet very  generally asserting the essential justice of the Northern position. But  it was early evident that the newspapers, one and all, were quite  unprepared for the determined front soon put up by South Carolina and  other Southern States. Surprised by the violence of Southern  declarations, the only explanation found by the British press was that  political control had been seized by the uneducated and lawless element.  The _Times_ characterized this element of the South as in a state of  deplorable ignorance comparable with that of the Irish peasantry, a  \"poor, proud, lazy, excitable and violent class, ever ready with knife  and revolver[43].\" The fate of the Union, according to the _Saturday  Review_, was in the hands of the \"most ignorant, most unscrupulous, and  most lawless [class] in the world--the poor or mean whites of the Slave  States[44].\" Like judgments were expressed by the _Economist_ and, more  mildly, by the _Spectator_[45]. Subsequently some of these journals  found difficulty in this connection, in swinging round the circle to  expressions of admiration for the wise and powerful aristocracy of the  South; but all, especially the _Times_, were skilled by long practice  in the journalistic art of facing about while claiming perfect  consistency. In denial of a Southern right of secession, also, they were  nearly a unit[46], though the _Saturday Review_ argued the case for the  South, making a pointed parallel between the present situation and that  of the American Colonies in seceding from England[47].    The quotations thus far made exhibit for the leading papers an initial  confusion and ignorance difficult to harmonize with the theory of an  \"enlightened press.\" The Reviews, by the conditions of publication, came  into action more slowly and during 1860 there appeared but one article,  in the _Edinburgh Review_, giving any adequate idea of what was really  taking place in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13791"],[0,"Psychology and Achievement (#9)"],[1," to you.
