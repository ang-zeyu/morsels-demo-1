That was the one serious blot  upon this measure.    He could see no justification, except that the hon. Minister,  yielding to pressure from a certain section on that side of the House,  had hastily brought on this measure.  He thought from the speeches  made in the House it was the consensus of opinion that Natives  should not have farms in areas that were essentially white,  just as it was desirable that white men should not be found in areas  essentially native.  And especially when they told the native population  that they were taking away from them a right they had to-day,  and they were going to substitute that right by appointing a Commission,  they were giving them very little justification for being satisfied  with this measure.  He did not think they were going to gain anything  by putting the cart before the horse.  He did not know  if Mr. Schreiner was accurate, but he told them that, roughly,  in the Transvaal, where the matter was most acute, the Native population  had bought something like 12,000 or 15,000 morgen of land in twelve years.  That, he thought, showed there was no extreme urgency for the measure.  To that extent he agreed entirely with the hon. member, and he believed  the Minister would be well advised to send the Bill to a Select Committee,  so that many of the details, which were extremely complicated and difficult,  might be thrashed out in that atmosphere, rather than on  the floor of the House.  (Opposition cheers.)    MR. E. N. GROBLER (Edenburg) said:  The present was one of the best measures  that the Government had so far brought forward, and it appeared clear  that they had a Government which truly represented the wishes of the public.  It was impossible to delay the solution of the Native problem,  and legislation on the subject had for a long time past been asked for.*  At the same time, he did not entirely agree with the methods,  proposed to be applied, and he did not like the system of allocating reserves  for Natives.  When once those reserves had been allocated, would it not result  in injury to agriculture and cattle breeding?  The farmers would suffer  from lack of labour, and that deficiency would be a growing one.  Neither could he agree to the principle of expropriation of land  belonging to whites in order to increase the size of the native reserves.  He considered the Bill was a complicated one.  The matter should be settled  by way of taxation, in the following way.  All Natives who  were in the service of whites should be exempted from taxation,  and treated as well as possible, and other Natives should be encouraged  to take similar service.  There were enormous reserves where the Natives  could go and live,** and if they refused to go there they should be required  to pay a stiff tax.  Then they would go and work for white people.  The hon. member for Tembuland had offered many objections to the Bill.  They should make that hon. member king of Tembuland.  In a country of the blind a man with one eye would be king.    --  * By a \"solution of the Native problem\", \"Free\" State farmers generally mean    the re-establishment of slavery.  ** It will be observed that these and similar mythological disquisitions     subsequently formed General Botha's assurances to Mr. Harcourt.     See Chapter XVI.  But some light is thrown on the subject     of these visionary Native Reserves by Mr. Fawcus' speech     based on official statistics (page 36 [above -- last Fawcus quote]).  --    MR. P. DUNCAN (Fordsburg) said he hoped the Minister would not take  the view of the last speaker.  Under the Bill it would be possible  for farmers to accumulate on their land as many Natives as they could get,  so long as they could use them as servants.  (Labour cheers.)  So far as he could see, even if it were carried out to the extent  that it was proposed to go, it would not very much reduce the social contact  which at present existed between whites and natives.    SIR W. B. BERRY (Queenstown) said he would like to know why the Minister  had run away from the Bill that had passed the second reading,  and now tabled another Bill in the shape of many amendments.  One would naturally complain that, seeing that they had in that House  a Native Affairs Committee, a non-party committee, specially chosen  to consider all matters relating to native affairs, that Bill,  which was a most important matter and dealt with native affairs from A to Z,  should have been referred to that committee.  The same thing  happened last session in reference to a Bill the Minister of Native Affairs  kept on the paper until nearly the end of the session, and the House  had to take the very unusual step almost on the last day of moving  that committee proceedings on that Bill be taken that day six months.  He (Sir W. B. Berry) proposed to move a similar amendment  to the motion now before the House.  In the remarks he addressed  when the Bill came up for second reading he had ventured to say  that there was no call for a bill of that nature at all;  there was no need for a Bill revolutionizing the attitude of the Union  with respect to the natives generally.  The only clue they could get  to the reason why the Bill was introduced was that a few die-hards  on the other side of the House had given the Minister to understand that  unless he brought in a Bill of that kind, or of a similarly drastic nature,  the position of the Government was in danger.  He hoped  some of these die-hards would come forward that evening  and tell them plainly and bluntly why they wanted that Bill,  why they were going to thrust it on the country without any notice,  and why they were calling on the House to revolutionize  the whole tenour and the whole order of things in regard to land matters  as far as the Natives were concerned.  Proceeding, the hon. member said  the only justification that had been offered for this Bill was that  a large amount of land had been transferred from Europeans to Natives.  An analysis of the return, however, showed that only sixteen farms  in the Transvaal had been so transferred during the last three years.  Surely that was not any justification why the European people of the Union  should get into a panic and why the administration of the day  were seeking to place on the Statute Book this most drastic legislation.  Another reason why he objected to this Bill was that it purported to appoint  a Commission to investigate to what extent and in what parts and in what time  land should be selected by the Commission for the purpose of being reserved  as additional native areas within the Union.  They were not given  any guarantee that the Commission was going to be appointed  nor any guarantee that it would ever report, but at the same time  whilst these indefinite assurances were attempted to be given to the House  there was no getting over this fact, that there was no time limit in the Bill  by which the real enacting clause in the Bill was to have any cessation.  When he spoke on this Bill before he supported it only on the understanding  that a time limit was to be put in, or that it should be an annual Bill.  He said unhesitatingly that the whole tendency of the Bill,  as it stood at the second reading, and more especially as it stood  with the amendments by the Minister on the notice paper,  was to drive the Native peasant off the land.  The only refuge  that that Native had was the town.    The country had not been prepared in any way for a Bill of this kind.  A cry had been heard throughout the land against the iniquities  proposed in the Bill.  If it had been found absolutely necessary  that legislation of this kind should be introduced, the least  that could be expected was that ample time should be given to the Natives  to thoroughly acquire a knowledge of the contents of the measure.  That opportunity had not been given them, and in this respect  there was a very serious grievance.  For the good order and peace of the Union  there was a very great danger ahead.  He had understood from those  well versed in native affairs that one of the greatest dangers  that could threaten us was to give the Natives anything  in the shape of a common grievance.  Divide and rule had been  a wise precaution in the government of the Natives.  When a common grievance  was found by four or five million people one could understand how great  that grievance must be.  One amendment the Minister had put on the paper  must give serious pause.  The late Minister of Native Affairs  issued to members last session a Squatters Bill.  The greatest objection  to that measure, and one which he thought led to its withdrawal,  was that it proposed to remove thousands upon thousands of natives  from land which they had been in the occupation of for scores of years.  It was in consequence of the disturbance which that Bill caused  throughout the Union that it was withdrawn.  In one of the amendments  on the paper the present Minister of Native Affairs brought back  in a somewhat clandestine manner the most objectionable feature of the Bill  that was withdrawn.    Mr. Speaker:  The amendment is not yet before the House.    SIR W. B. BERRY:  What Bill is it then that is to go into Committee?  (Hear, hear.)  Is it the Bill which was read a second time  or the Bill comprised in the Minister's amendments?  He moved that the House  go into committee on the Bill this day six months.    MR. T. L. SCHREINER (Tembuland), in seconding the amendment,  said that sufficient notice had not been given of the provisions of the Bill,  although the Natives, thanks to the time which had elapsed  since the second reading, were better acquainted with the measure  than they were a little while ago.    Mr. Schreiner proceeded to quote opinions"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#9)"],[1," be over a root which forces its way through the rocks,  or on a slippery path which the waterfall has drenched with its  spray--and besides all this, a disconsolate waste in the heart, no  memory to cheer us, no hope to which we may cling--let any one attempt  this, and he will feel the cold chill of night both outwardly and  inwardly.  The first fear of the human heart arises from God forsaking  us; but life dissipates it, and mankind, created after the image of  God, consoles us in our solitariness.  When even this consolation and  love, however, forsake us, then we feel what it means to be deserted by  God and man, and nature with her silent face terrifies rather than  consoles us.  Even when we firmly plant our feet upon the solid rocks,  they seem to tremble like the mists of the sea from which they once  slowly emerged.  When the eye longs for the light, and the moon rises  behind the firs, reflecting their tapering tops against the bright rock  opposite, it appears to us like the dead hand of a clock which was once  wound up, and will some day cease to strike.  There is no retreat for  the soul, which feels itself alone and forsaken even among the stars,  or in the heavenly world itself.  One thought brings us a little  consolation: the repose, the regularity, the immensity, and the  unavoidableness of nature.  Here, where the waterfall has clothed the  gray rocks on either side with green moss, the eye suddenly recognizes  a blue forget-me-not in the cool shade.  It is one of millions of  sisters now blossoming along all the rivulets and in all the meadows of  earth, and which have blossomed ever since the first morning of  creation shed its entire inexhaustible wealth over the world.  Every  vein in its leaves, every stamen in its cup, every fibre of its roots,  is numbered, and no power on earth can make the number more or less.  Still more, when we strain our weak eyes and, with superhuman power,  cast a more searching glance into the secrets of nature, when the  microscope discloses to us the silent laboratory of the seed, the bud  and the blossom, do we recognize the infinite, ever-recurring form in  the most minute tissues and cells, and the eternal unchangeableness of  Nature's plans in the most delicate fibre.  Could we pierce still  deeper, the same form-world would reveal itself, and the vision would  lose itself as in a hall hung with mirrors.  Such an infinity as this  lies hidden in this little flower.  If we look up to the sky, we see  again the same system--the moon revolving around the planets, the  planets around suns, and the suns around new suns, while to the  straining eye the distant star-nebulae themselves seem to be a new and  beautiful world.  Reflect then how these majestic constellations  periodically revolve, that the seasons may change, that the seed of  this forget-me-not may shed itself again and again, the cells open, the  leaves shoot out, and the blossoms decorate the carpet of the meadow;  and look upon the lady-bug which rocks itself in the blue cup of the  flower, and whose awakening into life, whose consciousness of  existence, whose living breath, are a thousand-fold more wonderful than  the tissue of the flower, or the dead mechanism of the heavenly bodies.  Consider that thou also belongest to this infinite warp and woof, and  that thou art permitted to comfort thyself with the infinite creatures  which revolve and live and disappear with thee.  But if this All, with  its smallest and its greatest, with its wisdom and its power, with the  wonders of its existence, and the existence of its wonders, is the work  of a Being in whose presence thy soul does not shrink back, before whom  thou fallest prostrate in a feeling of weakness and nothingness, and to  whom thou risest again in the feeling of His love and mercy--if thou  really feelest that something dwells in thee more endless and eternal  than the cells of the flowers, the spheres of the planets, and the life  of the insect--if thou recognizest in thyself as in a shadow the  reflection of the Eternal which illuminates thee--if thou feelest in  thyself, and under and above thyself, the omnipresence of the Real, in  which thy seeming becomes being, thy trouble, rest, thy solitude,  universality--then thou knowest the One to Whom thou criest in the dark  night of life: \"Creator and Father, Thy will be done in Heaven as upon  earth, and as on earth so also in me.\"  Then it grows bright in and  about thee.  The daybreak disappears with its cold mists, and a new  warmth streams through shivering nature.  Thou hast found a hand which  never again leaves thee, which holds thee when the mountains tremble  and moons are extinguished.  Wherever thou may'st be, thou art with  Him, and He with thee.  He is the eternally near, and His is the world  with its flowers and thorns, His is man with his joys and sorrows.  \"The least important thing does not happen except as God wills it.\"    With such thoughts I went on my way.  At one time, all was well with  me; at another, troubled; for even when we have found rest and peace in  the lowest depths of the soul, it is still hard to remain undisturbed  in this holy solitude.  Yes, many forget it after they find it and  scarcely know the way which leads back to it.    Weeks had flown, and not a syllable had reached me from her.  \"Perhaps  she is dead and lies in quiet rest,\" was another song forever on my  tongue, and always returning as often as I drove it from me.  It was  not impossible, for the Hofrath had told me she suffered with heart  troubles, and that he expected to find her no more among the living  every morning he visited her.  Could I ever forgive myself if she had  left this world and I had not taken farewell of her, nor told her at  the last moment how I loved her?  Must I not follow until I found her  again in another life, and heard from her that she loved me and that I  was forgiven?  How mankind defers from day to day the best it can do,  and the most beautiful things it can enjoy, without thinking that every  day may be the last one, and that lost time is lost eternity!  Then all  the words of the Hofrath, the last time I saw him, recurred to me, and  I felt that I had only resolved to make my sudden journey to show my  strength to him, and that it would have been a still more difficult  task to have confessed my weakness and remained.  It was clear to me  that it was my simple duty to return to her immediately and to bear  everything which Heaven ordained.  But as soon as I had laid the plan  for my return journey, I suddenly remembered the words of the Hofrath:  \"As soon as possible she must go away and be taken into the country.\"  She had herself told me that she spent the most of her time, in summer,  at her castle.  Perhaps she was there, in my immediate vicinity; in one  day I could be with her.  Thinking was doing; at daybreak I was off,  and at evening I stood at the gate of the castle.    The night was clear and bright.  The mountain peaks glistened in the  full gold of the sunset and the lower ridges were bathed in a rosy  blue.  A gray mist rose from the valleys which suddenly glistened when  it swept up into the higher regions, and then like a cloud-sea rolled  heavenwards.  The whole color-play reflected itself in the gently  agitated breast of the dark lake from whose shores the mountains seemed  to rise and fall, so that only the tops of the trees and the peaks of  the church steeples and the rising smoke from the houses defined the  limits which separated the reality of the world from its reflection.  My glance, however, rested upon only one spot--the old castle--where a  presentiment told me I should find her again.  No light could be seen  in the windows, no footstep broke the silence of the night.  Had my  presentiment deceived me?  I passed slowly through the outer gateway  and up the steps until I stood at the fore-court of the castle.  Here I  saw a sentinel pacing back and forwards, and I hastened to the soldier  to inquire who was in the castle.  \"The Countess and her attendants are  here,\" was the brief reply, and in an instant I stood at the main  portal and had even pulled the bell.  Then, for the first time, my  action occurred to me.  No one knew me.  I neither could nor dare say  who I was.  I had wandered for weeks about the mountains, and looked  like a beggar.  What should I say?  For whom should I ask?  There was  little time for consideration, however, for the door opened and a  servant in princely livery stood before me, and regarded me with  amazement.    I asked if the English lady, who I knew would never forsake the  Countess, was in the castle, and when the servant replied in the  affirmative, I begged for paper and ink and wrote her I was present to  inquire after the health of the Countess.    The servant called an attendant, who took the letter away.  I heard  every step in the long halls, and every moment I waited, my position  became more unendurable.  The old family portraits of the princely  house hung upon the walls--knights in full armor, ladies in antique  costume, and in the center a lady in the white robes of a nun with a  red cross upon her breast.  At any other time I might have looked upon  these pictures and never thought that a human heart once beat in their  breasts.  But now it seemed to me I could suddenly read whole volumes  in their features, and that all of them said to me: \"We also have once  lived and suffered.\"  Under these iron armors secrets were once hidden  as even now in my own breast.  These white robes and the red cross are  real proofs that a battle was fought here like that now raging in my  own heart.  Then I fancied all of them regarded me with pity, and a  loftier haughtiness rested on their features as if they would say, Thou  dost not belong to us.  I was growing uneasy every moment, when  suddenly a light step dissipated my dream.  The English lady came down  the stairs and asked "]]]
