[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#9)"],[1,"nor with discretion.\"    The Yogi Philosophy teaches of the existence of a Universal Creative  Will, emanating from the Absolute--infilled with the power of the  Absolute and acting under established natural laws, which performs the  active work of creation in the world, similar to that performed by  \"Cudsworth's Plastic Nature,\" just mentioned. This Creative Will is not  Schopenhauer's Will-to-Live. It is not a Thing-in-itself, but a vehicle  or instrument of the Absolute. It is an emanation of the mind of the  Absolute--a manifestation in action of its Will--a mental product  rather than a physical, and, of course, saturated with the life-energy  of its projector.    This Creative Will is not a mere blind, mechanical energy or force--it  is far more than this. We can explain it only by referring you to the  manifestation of the Will in yourself. You wish to move your arm, and  it moves. The immediate force may seem to be a mechanical force, but  what is back of that force--what is the essence of the force? The Will!  All manifestations of energy--all the causes of motion--all forces--are  forms of the action of the Will of the One--the Creative Will--acting  under natural laws established by the One, ever moving, acting,  forcing, urging, driving, leading. We do not mean that every little act  is a thought of the moment on the part of the Absolute, and a reaching  out of the Will in obedience to that thought. On the contrary, we mean  that the One set the Will into operation as a whole, conceiving of laws  and limitations in its action, the Will constantly operating in  obedience to that conception, the results manifesting in what we call  natural law; natural forces, etc. Besides this, the Absolute is  believed to manifest its Will specially upon occasions; and moreover  permits its Will to be applied and used by the individual wills of  individual Egos, under the general Law and laws, and plan of the One.    But you must not suppose that the Will is manifested only in the form  of mechanical forces, cohesion, chemical attraction, electricity,  gravitation, etc.    It does more than this. It is in full operation in all forms of life,  and living things. It is present everywhere. Back of all forms of  movement and action, we find a moving cause--usually a _Pressure_. This  is true of that which we have been calling mechanical forces, and of  all forms of that which we call Life Energy. Now, note this, this great  Pressure that you will observe in all Life Action, is the Creative  Will--the Will Principle of the One--bending toward the carrying out of  the Great Plan of Life.    Look where we will, on living forms, and we may begin to recognize the  presence of a certain creative energy at work--building up; moulding,  directing; tearing down; replacing, etc.--always active in its efforts  to create, preserve and conserve life. This visible creative energy is  what the Yogi Philosophy calls \"the Creative Will,\" and which forms the  subject of this lesson. The Creative Will is that striving, longing,  pressing forward, unfolding, progressing evolutionary effort, that all  thoughtful people see in operation in all forms of life--throughout all  Nature. From the lowest to the highest forms of life, the Effort,  Energy, Pressure, may be recognized in action, creating, preserving,  nourishing, and improving its forms. It is that Something that we  recognize when we speak of \"Nature's Forces\" at work in plant growth  and animal functioning. If you will but keep the word and  idea--\"NATURE\"--before you, you will be able to more clearly form the  mental concept of the Creative Will. The Creative Will is that which  you have been calling \"Nature at Work\" in the growth of the plant; the  sprouting of the seed; the curling and reaching of the tendril; the  fertilization of the blossoms, etc. You have seen this Will at work, if  you have watched growing things.    We call this energy \"the Creative Will,\" because it is the objective  manifestation of the Creative Energy of the Absolute--Its visible Will  manifested in the direction of physical life. It is as much Will in  action, as the Will that causes your arm to move in response to its  power. It is no mere chance thing, or mechanical law--it is life action  in operation.    This Creative Will not only causes movement in completed life, but all  movement and action in life independent of the personal will of its  individual forms. All the phenomena of the so-called Unconscious belong  to it. It causes the body to grow; attends to the details of  nourishment, assimilation, digestion, elimination, and all of the rest.  It builds up bodies, organs, and parts, and keeps them in operation and  function.    The Creative Will is directed to the outward expression of Life--to the  objectification of Life. You may call this energy the \"Universal Life  Energy\" if you wish, but, to those who know it, it is a Will--an  active, living Will, in full operation and power, pressing forward  toward the manifestation of objective life.    The Creative Will seems to be filled with a strong Desire to manifest.  It longs to express itself, and to give birth to forms of activity.  Desire lies under and in all forms of its manifestations. The ever  present Desire of the Creative Will causes lower forms to be succeeded  by higher forms--and is the moving cause of evolution--it is the  Evolutionary Urge itself, which ever cries to its manifestations, \"Move  on; move upward.\"    In the Hindu classic, the \"Mahabarata,\" Brahma created the most  beautiful female being ever known, and called her Tillotama. He  presented her in turn to all the gods, in order to witness their wonder  and admiration. Siva's desire to behold her was so great that it  developed in him four faces, in succession, as she made the tour of the  assembly; and Indra's longing was so intense that his body became all  eyes. In this myth may be seen exemplified the effect of Desire and  Will in the forms of life, function and shape--all following Desire and  Need, as in the case of the long neck of the giraffe which enables him  to reach for the high branches of the trees in his native land; and in  the long neck and high legs of the fisher birds, the crane, stork,  ibis, etc.    The Creative Will finds within itself a desire to create suns, and they  are formed. It desired planets to revolve around the suns, and they  were thrown off in obedience to the law. It desired plant life, and  plant life appeared, working from higher to lower form. Then came  animal life, from nomad to man. Some of the animal forms yielded to the  desire to fly, and wings appeared gradually, and we called it  bird-life. Some felt a desire to burrow in the ground, and lo! came the  moles, gophers, etc. It wanted a thinking creature, and Man with his  wonderful brain was evolved. Evolution is more than a mere survival of  the fittest; natural selection, etc. Although it uses these laws as  tools and instruments, still back of them is that insistent urge--that  ever-impelling desire--that ever-active Creative Will. Lamark was  nearer right than Darwin when he claimed that Desire was back of it  all, and preceded function and form. Desire wanted form and function,  and produced them by the activity of the Creative Will.    This Creative Will acts like a living force--and so it is indeed--but  it does not act as a reasoning, intellectual Something, in one  sense--instead it manifests rather the \"feeling,\" wanting, longing,  instinctive phase of mind, akin to those \"feelings\" and resulting  actions that we find within our natures. The Will acts on the  Instinctive Plane.    Evolution shows us Life constantly pressing forward toward higher and  still higher forms of expression. The urge is constantly upward and  onward. It is true that some species sink out of sight their work in  the world having been done, but they are succeeded by other species  more in harmony with their environment and the needs of their times.  Some races of men decay, but others build on their foundations, and  reach still greater heights.    The Creative Will is something different from Reason or Intellect. But  it underlies these. In the lower forms of life, in which mind is in but  small evidence, the Will is in active operation, manifesting in  Instinct and Automatic Life Action, so called. It does not depend upon  brains for manifestation--for these lowly forms of life have no  brains--but is in operation through every part of the body of the  living thing.    Evidences of the existence of the Creative Will acting independently of  the brains of animal and plant life may be had in overwhelming quantity  if we will but examine the life action in the lower forms of life.    The testimony of the investigators along the lines of the Evolutionary  school of thought, show us that the Life Principle was in active  operation in lowly animal and plant life millions of years before  brains capable of manifesting Thought were produced. Haekel informs us  that during more than half of the enormous time that has elapsed since  organic life first became evident, no animal sufficiently advanced to  have a brain was in existence. Brains were evolved according to the law  of desire or necessity, in accordance with the Great Plan, but they  were not needed for carrying on the wonderful work of the creation and  preservation of the living forms. And they are not today. The tiny  infant, and the senseless idiot are not able to think intelligently,  but still their life functions go on regularly and according to law, in  spite of the absence of thinking brains. And the life work of the  plants, and of the lowly forms of animal life, is carried on likewise.  This wonderful thing that we call Instinct is but another name for the  manifestation of the Creative Will which flows from the One Life, or  the Absolute.    Even as far down the scale of life as the Monera, we may see the  Creative Will in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#9)"],[1,"  that it should stay away, as for a bit of steel to rush from a      magnet. The simile is eminently correct for you, my dear girl,      are a magnet, and my heart is as true to you as steel. I shall      make my absence as brief as possible. Not a day, not an hour,      not a minute, shall I waste either in going or returning. Oh,      this business; but I wont complain, for we must have something      for our hive besides honey--something that rhymes with it--and      that we must have it, I must bestir myself. You will find me      a faithful correspondent. Like the spider, I shall drop a line      by (almost) every post; and mind, you must give me letter for      letter. I can't give you credit. Your returns must be prompt      and punctual.        Passionately yours,      LEWIS SHUMAN.        To Miss Nellie Carter,      No. -- Fifth Avenue, New York.      _14.--From an Absent Lover._        Chicago, Ill., Sept. 10, 1915        My Dearest Kate: This sheet of paper, though I should cover      it with loving words, could never tell you truly how I long      to see you again. Time does not run on with me now at the      same pace as with other people; the hours seem days, the days      weeks, while I am absent from you, and I have no faith in the      accuracy of clocks and almanacs. Ah! if there were truth in      clairvoyance, wouldn't I be with you at this moment! I wonder      if you are as impatient to see me as I am to fly to you?      Sometimes it seems as if I must leave business and every      thing else to the Fates, and take the first train to Dawson.      However, the hours do move, though they don't appear to, and      in a few more weeks we shall meet again. Let me hear from you      as frequently as possible in the meantime. Tell me of your      health, your amusements and your affections.        Remember that every word you write will be a comfort to me.        Unchangeably yours,      WILLIAM MILLER.        To Miss Kate Martin,      Dawson, N.D.      _15.--A Declaration of Love at First Sight._        Waterford, Maine, May 8th, 1915        Dear Miss Searles:        Although I have been in your society but once the impression      you have made upon me is so deep and powerful that I cannot      forbear writing to you, in defiance of all rules of etiquette.      Affection is sometimes of slow growth but sometimes it springs      up in a moment. In half an hour after I was introduced to you      my heart was no longer my own, I have not the assurance      to suppose that I have been fortunate enough to create any      interest in yours; but will you allow me to cultivate your      acquaintance in the hope or being able to win your regard in      the course of time? Petitioning for a few lines in reply.        I remain, dear Miss Searles,      Yours devotedly,      E.C. NICKS.        Miss E. Searles,      Waterford, Maine.      _16.--Proposing Marriage._        Wednesday, October 20th, 1894        Dearest Etta:        The delightful hours I have passed in your society have left      an impression on my mind that is altogether indelible,      and cannot be effaced even by time itself. The frequent      opportunities I have possessed, of observing the thousand acts      of amiability and kindness which mark the daily tenor of your      life, have ripened my feelings of affectionate regard into      a passion at once ardent and sincere until I have at length      associated my hopes of future happiness with the idea of you      as a life partner, in them. Believe me, dearest Etta, this is      no puerile fancy, but the matured results of a long and warmly      cherished admiration of your many charms of person and mind.      It is love--pure devoted love, and I feel confident that your      knowledge of my character will lead you to ascribe my motives      to their true source.        May I then implore you to consult your own heart, and should      this avowal of my fervent and honorable passion for you      be crowned with your acceptance and approval, to grant me      permission to refer the matter to your parents. Anxiously      awaiting your answer,        I am, dearest Etta,      Your sincere and faithful lover,      GEO. COURTRIGHT.        To Miss Etta Jay,      Malden, Ill.      _17.--From a Gentleman to a Widow._        Philadelphia, May 10th, 1915        My Dear Mrs. Freeman:        I am sure you are too clear-sighted not to have observed the      profound impression which your amiable qualities, intelligence      and personal attractions have made upon my heart, and as you      nave not repelled my attentions nor manifested displeasure      when I ventured to hint at the deep interest I felt in your      welfare and happiness, I cannot help hoping that you will      receive an explicit expression of my attachments, kindly and      favorably. I wish it were in my power to clothe the feelings      I entertain for you in such words as should make my pleadings      irresistible; but, after all, what could I say, more than you      are very dear to me, and that the most earnest desire of my      soul is to have the privilege of calling you my wife? Do      you, can you love me? You will not, I am certain, keep me in      suspense, for you are too good and kind to trifle for a moment      with sincerity like mine. Awaiting your answer,        I remain with respectful affection,      Ever yours,      HENRY MURRAY.        Mrs. Julia Freeman,      Philadelphia.      _18.--From a Lady to an Inconstant Lover._        Dear Harry:        It is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which      has given me great pain, and upon which silence has become      impossible if I would preserve my self-respects. You cannot      but be aware that I have just reason for saying that you have      much displeased me. You have apparently forgotten what is due      to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least. You cannot      suppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by      conduct toward other ladies from which I should naturally      have the right to expect you to abstain. I am not so vulgar a      person as to be jealous. When there is cause to infer changed      feelings, or unfaithfulness to promises of constancy, jealousy      is not the remedy. What the remedy is I need not say--we both      of us have it in our hands. I am sure you will agree with me      that we must come to some understanding by which the future      shall be governed. Neither you nor I can bear a divided      allegiance. Believe me that I write more in sorrow than      in anger. You have made me very unhappy, and perhaps      thoughtlessly. But it will take much to reassure me of your      unaltered regard.        Yours truly,      EMMA.    [Illustration: HEALTHFUL OUTDOOR EXERCISE.]    [Illustration: THE HUMAN FACE, LIKE A FLOWER, SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.]             *       *       *       *       *    HINTS AND HELPS ON GOOD BEHAVIOR AT ALL TIMES AND AT ALL PLACES.      1. It takes acquaintance to found a noble esteem, but politeness  prepares the way. Indeed, as ontaigne [Transcriber's note: Montaigne?]  says, Courtesy begets esteem at sight. Urbanity is half of affability,  and affability is a charm worth possessing.    2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs  the Christian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are  circumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under  the little yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul  standard.    3. Matthew Arnold says, \"Conduct is three-fourths of character,\"  and Christian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of  rectitude, a lowly soul, with a pure and kind heart are elements  of nobility which will work out in the life of a human being at  home--everywhere. \"Private refinement makes public gentility.\"    4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment.  Remember that if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you  are ruined.    5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine  spirit begets cheer and hope.    6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.    7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and  good expression; they will yield perpetual interest.    8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local  occurrences, but abhor gossip, and above all scandal.    9. Banish a self-conscience spirit--the source of much  awkwardness--with a constant aim to make others happy. Remember that  it is incumbent upon gentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.    10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking: Head  erect--not too rigid--chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary  motion about the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking,  standing or sitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is  deforming and therefore unhealthful.    11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs.    12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the are should be  limited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they  almost touch the clothing.    13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost  say, forget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails,  cordial and helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study  repose of attitude here as well as in the rest of the body.    14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point  elsewhere, as a rule.    15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and  smile, as you speak.    16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any  circumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.    17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in  mind your own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws of society,  and bow politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand  before all woman-kind as you do at her bar."]]]
