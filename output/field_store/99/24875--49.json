We want  blood for this test and for the next.\"    \"I wish the brute had bitten you!\" Curtis snarled; \"then, perhaps, you  wouldn't be so precious keen on economics. You did right to name it  Satan! and if it doesn't attract devils nothing will. I'm not going to  touch it again. See if you can hold the beast by yourself, Matt! It  seems to be less afraid of you than of either of us.\"    Kelson called out: \"Puss!\", and the cat at once came to him.    As it was now striking twelve, Hamar carefully shook three drops of  Curtis's blood from the cup on to Satan's back, while he instructed  Kelson to rub the animal's coat with the palm of the hand. Kelson  cautiously obeyed. There was a loud crackling and a shower of sparks,  of the same lurid red colour as the reflection in the mirror on the  previous night, flew out into the enveloping darkness.    \"That will do!\" Hamar observed quietly. \"Test two is satisfactorily  accomplished. We must be riper for Hell than we imagined. There is no  need for you fellows to stay any longer. I can manage the third test  alone.\"    As soon as his colleagues had gone and he felt assured they were no  longer within hearing, Hamar took a saucer from the mantelshelf,  filled it half full of milk, and poured into it some colourless liquid  out of a tiny phial labelled poison.    \"Here pussy,\" he called out, softly. \"Pretty pussy, come and have your  supper! Pussy!\"    And Satan, unable to resist the tempting sight of the milk, crept out  of his hiding-place and quite unsuspiciously dipped his tongue into  the saucer and lapped. Hamar, in the meanwhile went to a box at the  foot of the bed and produced a sack. Then he slipped on his boots and  coat, and opening the door of a cupboard near the head of the bed  fetched out a small spade.    He was now ready; and--so was pussy.    \"That paves the way for test six,\" Hamar observed; \"no one can say I  am a waster--I make use of everything--and every one;\" and so saying  he tumbled the cat into the sack and hurried out.    Some half-hour later he had returned to his room, and was busily  engaged making preparations for test three. Letting a drop of Curtis's  blood fall on the skull, he put the latter under his pillow, and  retired to rest. He had slept for little over an hour, when he awoke  with a start. The muffled sound of hammering--as of nails in a  coffin--was going on all around him, and occasionally it seemed to him  that something big and heavy stalked across the floor; but in spite of  the fact that the room was illuminated with a red glow--the same lurid  red as had appeared in tests one and two--nothing was to be seen. The  phenomena lasted five or six minutes and then everything was again  normal. Hamar was so terrified that he lay with his head under the  bedclothes till morning, and vowed nothing on earth would persuade him  to sleep in that room again. But sunlight soon restored his courage,  and by the evening he was quite eager to go on with the next test. He  had some difficulty in persuading any one to allow him the use of an  oven for so pernicious a mixture as nightshade and hemlock; but at  last he over-ruled the objections of some good-natured woman--the  mother of one of the office boys at his former employer's--and test  four proved as successful as the previous three. The preliminary part  of test five was also successfully accomplished; but in carrying out  the second part of it, Hamar all but met with disaster. He was walking  along Kearney Street with the specially prepared hazel twig carefully  concealed beneath his coat, when just opposite Saddler's jewelry  store, he came across a child standing by itself. The nearest person  being some fifty yards away, and no policeman within sight, Hamar  concluded this was too good an opportunity to be lost. He whipped out  the twig, and held it, in the manner prescribed, in front of the  child. The effect was instantaneous. The child turned white as death,  its eyes bulged with terror, and opening its mouth to its full extent  it commenced to shriek and yell. Then it fell on the pavement; and  clutching and clawing the air, and foaming at the mouth rolled over  and over. People from every quarter flocked to the spot, and judging  Hamar, from his proximity to the child, to be responsible for its  condition, shouted for the police. The latter, however, arrived too  late. Hamar, whose presence of mind had only left him for the moment  seeing a bicycle leaning against a store door, jumped on it and soon  put a respectable distance between himself and the crowd.    That night the trio met once more in Hamar's room for test six. There  was a wood fire in the grate, and on it a tin vessel containing the  prescribed ingredients. Somewhat unpleasantly conspicuous amongst  these ingredients were the death's-head moth, and the soil from  Satan's grave. As soon as the mixture had been heated three hours, the  vessel was removed, the fire extinguished, and the room made  absolutely dark. Then the three sat close together and waited.    On the stroke of two every article in the room began to rattle, whilst  out of the tin vessel flew a blood red moth. After circling three  times round each of the sitter's heads, the moth flew back again into  the vessel, and the silence that ensued was followed by a soft tapping  at the window, and the appearance of something, that resembled a big  tube filled with a thick, pale blue fluid, made up of a mass of  distinct veins. This tube floated into the room, and passing close to  the three sitters, who involuntarily shrank away from it, disappeared  in the wall, behind them. A loud crack as if the branch of a tree had  broken, terminated the phenomena--the room again becoming pitch dark.  But the three sitters, although they knew there would be no further  manifestation that night, were too terrified to move. They remained  huddled together in the same spot till the morning was well advanced.          CHAPTER V    THE INITIATION      San Francisco possesses one great advantage--you can easily get out of  it. Leaving the pan-handle of the Park behind one, and following the  turn of the cars, one passes through a pretty valley, green and fair  as any garden, and dotted with small houses. An old cemetery lies to  one side of it; where unconventional inscriptions and queer epitaphs  can be traced on the half-buried stones, covered with a tangle of  vines and weeds. Still moving forward one reaches Olympus, and  climbing to its heights, one sees away below, in the far distance, the  Coast Range--like a rampart of strength; the blue waters of the bay,  sparkling and dancing in the sunlight--steamers flashing their path on  its bosom; and tiny white specks scudding in the breeze. Below is the  city, its houses, small, and closed in, like toy villages in Christmas  boxes; whilst the slopes around are green with fresh grass; and here  and there are thick clusters of eucalyptus and pines. The ocean is  partly hidden from view by a peak, which rises directly to the west,  and is separated from that on which one is standing by a deep and  thickly wooded valley. Descending, by means of a narrow winding path,  one passes through dense clumps of hickory, chestnut, mountain ash,  and walnut trees, whose strong lateral branches afford ample  protection from the sun, and at the same time furnish playgrounds to  innumerable bright-eyed squirrels. Further down one comes upon gentle  elms, succeeded by sassafras and locust--these, in their turn,  succeeded by the softer linden, red bud, catalpa, and maple; and at  the foot of the declivity, and in the bottom of the valley, wild  shrubbery, interspersed with silver willows, and white poplars. Still  following the path down the vale, in a southerly direction, one, at  length, finds oneself in an amphitheatre, shut in on all sides by  trees and bushes of a still greater variety; here and there, a  gigantic and much begnarled oak; here, a triple-stemmed tulip tree of  some eighty feet in height, its glossy, vivid green leaves and profuse  blossoms presenting a picture of unsurpassed beauty and splendour;  there, equally beautiful, though in marked contrast, a tall and  slender silver birch. The floor of the amphitheatre is, for the most  part, grass--soft, thick, velvety and miraculously green. The silence  is such as makes it wholly inconceivable, that so vast a city as San  Francisco can be little over six miles distant. Though one may strain  one's ears to the utmost, nothing is to be heard but the occasional  tinkling of a cow-bell, the lowing of cattle and the desultory note of  birds. It is the perfect quiet which Nature alone can give; and it so  impressed Hamar that he at once decided that this was the very spot  essential for the ceremony of initiation into the Black Art.    The locality selected, the night had next to be chosen--and the  conditions demanding that on the night of the initiation there must be  a new moon, cusp of seventh house, and conjoined with Saturn, in  opposition to Jupiter,[16] Hamar and his confederates had to wait  exactly three weeks, from the date of the conclusion of the tests,  before they could proceed.    Shortly before midnight, on the spot already described, Hamar, Curtis  and Kelson met; and, after searching thoroughly amongst the trees and  bushes in the vicinity of the amphitheatre to make sure no one was in  hiding, they commenced operations.    On a perfectly level piece of ground a circle of seven feet radius was  clearly defined. This circle was cut into seven sectors; and an inner  circle from the same centre and with a radius of six feet was next  drawn. In each part of the sectors, between the circumferences of the  first and second circle, were inscribed, in chalk, the names of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#9)"],[1,"of those  parts. Seest thou, then, how narrow, how confined, is the glory ye take  pains to spread abroad and extend! Can the fame of a single Roman  penetrate where the glory of the Roman name fails to pass? Moreover, the  customs and institutions of different races agree not together, so that  what is deemed praise worthy in one country is thought punishable in  another. Wherefore, if any love the applause of fame, it shall not  profit him to publish his name among many peoples. Then, each must be  content to have the range of his glory limited to his own people; the  splendid immortality of fame must be confined within the bounds of a  single race.    'Once more, how many of high renown in their own times have been lost in  oblivion for want of a record! Indeed, of what avail are written records  even, which, with their authors, are overtaken by the dimness of age  after a somewhat longer time? But ye, when ye think on future fame,  fancy it an immortality that ye are begetting for yourselves. Why, if  thou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity, what room hast thou left  for rejoicing in the durability of thy name? Verily, if a single  moment's space be compared with ten thousand years, it has a certain  relative duration, however little, since each period is definite. But  this same number of years--ay, and a number many times as great--cannot  even be compared with endless duration; for, indeed, finite periods may  in a sort be compared one with another, but a finite and an infinite  never. So it comes to pass that fame, though it extend to ever so wide a  space of years, if it be compared to never-lessening eternity, seems not  short-lived merely, but altogether nothing. But as for you, ye know not  how to act aright, unless it be to court the popular breeze, and win the  empty applause of the multitude--nay, ye abandon the superlative worth  of conscience and virtue, and ask a recompense from the poor words of  others. Let me tell thee how wittily one did mock the shallowness of  this sort of arrogance. A certain man assailed one who had put on the  name of philosopher as a cloak to pride and vain-glory, not for the  practice of real virtue, and added: \"Now shall I know if thou art a  philosopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly and patiently.\" The other  for awhile affected to be patient, and, having endured to be abused,  cried out derisively: \"_Now_, do you see that I am a philosopher?\" The  other, with biting sarcasm, retorted: \"I should have hadst thou held thy  peace.\" Moreover, what concern have choice spirits--for it is of such  men we speak, men who seek glory by virtue--what concern, I say, have  these with fame after the dissolution of the body in death's last hour?  For if men die wholly--which our reasonings forbid us to believe--there  is no such thing as glory at all, since he to whom the glory is said to  belong is altogether non-existent. But if the mind, conscious of its own  rectitude, is released from its earthly prison, and seeks heaven in free  flight, doth it not despise all earthly things when it rejoices in its  deliverance from earthly bonds, and enters upon the joys of heaven?'        SONG VII.    GLORY MAY NOT LAST.          Oh, let him, who pants for glory's guerdon,        Deeming glory all in all,      Look and see how wide the heaven expandeth,        Earth's enclosing bounds how small!        Shame it is, if your proud-swelling glory        May not fill this narrow room!      Why, then, strive so vainly, oh, ye proud ones!        To escape your mortal doom?        Though your name, to distant regions bruited,        O'er the earth be widely spread,      Though full many a lofty-sounding title        On your house its lustre shed,        Death at all this pomp and glory spurneth        When his hour draweth nigh,      Shrouds alike th' exalted and the humble,        Levels lowest and most high.        Where are now the bones of stanch Fabricius?        Brutus, Cato--where are they?      Lingering fame, with a few graven letters,        Doth their empty name display.        But to know the great dead is not given        From a gilded name alone;      Nay, ye all alike must lie forgotten,        'Tis not _you_ that fame makes known.        Fondly do ye deem life's little hour        Lengthened by fame's mortal breath;      There but waits you--when this, too, is taken--        At the last a second death.        VIII.      'But that thou mayst not think that I wage implacable warfare against  Fortune, I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men  well--I mean when she reveals herself, uncovers her face, and confesses  her true character. Perhaps thou dost not yet grasp my meaning. Strange  is the thing I am trying to express, and for this cause I can scarce  find words to make clear my thought. For truly I believe that Ill  Fortune is of more use to men than Good Fortune. For Good Fortune, when  she wears the guise of happiness, and most seems to caress, is always  lying; Ill Fortune is always truthful, since, in changing, she shows her  inconstancy. The one deceives, the other teaches; the one enchains the  minds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive good,  the other delivers them by the knowledge of the frail nature of  happiness. Accordingly, thou mayst see the one fickle, shifting as the  breeze, and ever self-deceived; the other sober-minded, alert, and wary,  by reason of the very discipline of adversity. Finally, Good Fortune, by  her allurements, draws men far from the true good; Ill Fortune ofttimes  draws men back to true good with grappling-irons. Again, should it be  esteemed a trifling boon, thinkest thou, that this cruel, this odious  Fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends--that  other hid from thee alike the faces of the true friends and of the  false, but in departing she hath taken away _her_ friends, and left thee  _thine_? What price wouldst thou not have given for this service in the  fulness of thy prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate?  Cease, then, to seek the wealth thou hast lost, since in true friends  thou hast found the most precious of all riches.'        SONG VIII.    LOVE IS LORD OF ALL.          Why are Nature's changes bound      To a fixed and ordered round?      What to leagued peace hath bent      Every warring element?      Wherefore doth the rosy morn      Rise on Phoebus' car upborne?      Why should Phoebe rule the night,      Led by Hesper's guiding light?      What the power that doth restrain      In his place the restless main,      That within fixed bounds he keeps,      Nor o'er earth in deluge sweeps?      Love it is that holds the chains,      Love o'er sea and earth that reigns;      Love--whom else but sovereign Love?--      Love, high lord in heaven above!      Yet should he his care remit,      All that now so close is knit      In sweet love and holy peace,      Would no more from conflict cease,      But with strife's rude shock and jar      All the world's fair fabric mar.        Tribes and nations Love unites      By just treaty's sacred rites;      Wedlock's bonds he sanctifies      By affection's softest ties.      Love appointeth, as is due,      Faithful laws to comrades true--      Love, all-sovereign Love!--oh, then,      Ye are blest, ye sons of men,      If the love that rules the sky      In your hearts is throned on high!          BOOK III.    TRUE HAPPINESS AND FALSE.           SUMMARY         CH. I. Boethius beseeches Philosophy to continue. She promises to       lead him to true happiness.--CH. II. Happiness is the one end which       all created beings seek. They aim variously at (_a_) wealth, or       (_b_) rank, or (_c_) sovereignty, or (_d_) glory, or (_e_)       pleasure, because they think thereby to attain either (_a_)       contentment, (_b_) reverence, (_c_) power, (_d_) renown, or (_e_)       gladness of heart, in one or other of which they severally imagine       happiness to consist.--CH. III. Philosophy proceeds to consider       whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways, (_a_)       So far from bringing contentment, riches only add to men's       wants.--CH. IV. (_b_) High position cannot of itself win respect.       Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands. They       even fall into contempt through lapse of time.--CH. V. (_c_)       Sovereignty cannot even bestow safety. History tells of the       downfall of kings and their ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their       lives. --CH. VI. (_d_) Fame conferred on the unworthy is but       disgrace. The splendour of noble birth is not a man's own, but his       ancestors'.--CH. VII. (_e_) Pleasure begins in the restlessness of       desire, and ends in repentance. Even the pure pleasures of home may       turn to gall and bitterness.--CH. VIII. All fail, then, to give       what they promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying evil       involved in each of these aims. Beauty and bodily strength are       likewise of little worth. In strength man is surpassed by the       brutes; beauty is but outward show.--CH. IX. The source of men's       error in following these phantoms of good is that _they break up       and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible_.       Contentment, power, reverence, renown, and joy are essentially       bound up one with the other, and, if they are to be attained at       all, must be attained _together_. True happiness, if it can be       found, will include them all. But it cannot be found among the       perishable things hitherto considered.--CH. X. Such a happiness       necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very happiness,       and in a manner, therefore, the happy man partakes also of the       Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since they       are all pursued only for the sake of good; it is _good_ which is       the sole ultimate end. "]]]
