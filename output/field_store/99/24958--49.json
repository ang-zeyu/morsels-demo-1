You see, I don't want to make  trouble for anybody.\"    \"Are they in town yet?\"    \"I presume they are. But don't say I mentioned it, please,\" pleaded the  bookseller.    No more was said, and having paid for the book Powell walked out, with  Dick behind him.    \"If those fellows are drinking it's a jolly shame,\" declared Dick, when  they were out of hearing. \"What do you think about it, Songbird?\"    \"Exactly as you do, Dick.\"    \"Shall we hunt them up?\"    \"What good will it do? Lew Flapp won't listen to what you say, and I'm  sure I don't want to play the spy and report him.\"    \"But what if he is leading some innocent students astray? He has had  half a dozen young chaps dangling at his heels lately.\"    \"I know that.\" There was a pause. \"We might look into some of the  places as we pass them.\"    Very slowly they walked up and down the main street of Cedarville, a  thing easy to do, since the stores extended only a distance of two  blocks. Then they passed to a side street, upon which two new places  had recently been built.    One of the new places was a butcher shop, and this was dark and  deserted. Next to it was a new resort known as Mike Sherry's Palace,  and this was well lit up and evidently in full blast.    \"If Flapp is drinking he is evidently in this place,\" remarked Dick.  \"But I don't see anything of him,\" he added, after peering through the  swinging doors.    \"They tell me this Sherry has a room upstairs, also for drinking  purposes,\" returned Powell. \"Maybe Flapp and his friends are up there.  They wouldn't want to be seen in public, you must remember.\"    \"That is true. But how do they get upstairs--through the saloon?\"    \"There may be a back way. Let us look.\"    They walked around to the rear of the building and here found a door  leading into a back hall. But the door was locked.    \"This is the way up, I feel sure,\" said Dick. \"Somebody has locked the  door as a safeguard.\"    \"Then, I'm afraid, we'll have to give it up.\"    \"Not yet, Songbird.\" Dick had been looking over toward the rear of the  butcher shop. \"See, the painters are at work here and have left one of  their ladders. Wonder if we can't move it over and put it up under one  of those windows?\"    The matter was talked over for a minute, and then the two boys took  hold of the long ladder and did as Dick desired.    \"This may be a wild goose chase,\" was Powell's comment. \"And if it is,  and Mike Sherry discovers us, he'll want us to explain. Maybe he'll  take us for burglars.\"    \"You can keep shady if you want to, Songbird. I'm going up,\" and so  speaking Dick began to mount the ladder.    The window under which the ladder had been placed was open from the top  only, and a half curtain over the lower portion hid what was beyond  from view. So, in order to look over the curtain, Dick had to climb to  the very top of the ladder and then brace his feet on the window sill.    He could now hear voices quite plainly, and presently heard Lew Flapp  speak.    \"I'm on the right track,\" he called softly to Powell. \"They are in the  room next to this one, but the door between is wide open.\"    \"Shall I come up?\"    \"Suit yourself. I'm going inside.\"    As good as his word, Dick slipped over the top of the lowered window  sash, and an instant later stood in the room, which was but dimly lit.  Then he tiptoed his way behind a door and peeped into the room beyond.    Seven cadets were present, including Lew Flapp, Ben Hurdy, and their  particular cronies Jackson, Pender, and Rockley. The others were two  young cadets named Joe Davis and Harry Moss.    On the table in the center of the room stood a platter of chicken  sandwiches and also several bottles containing beer and wine, and a box  of cigars. Evidently all of the crowd had been eating and drinking, and  now several were filling the apartment with tobacco smoke.    \"Come, smoke up, Moss,\" cried Lew Flapp, shoving the box of cigars  toward one of the younger cadets. \"Don't be afraid. It won't kill you.\"    \"Thank you, Flapp, but I--I guess I won't to-night,\" pleaded Harry Moss,  whose face was strangely flushed.    \"Why not?\"    \"I--I--don't feel well. The drinking has made me feel sick.\"    \"Oh, nonsense! Here, take this cigar and smoke up. It will brace your  nerves. And you, Davis, have another glass of something to drink,\" went  on Lew Flapp, pouring out a glassful and handing it to the one  addressed.    \"Thank you, Flapp, but I don't want any more,\" answered Joe Davis. He  looked as ill at ease as did Harry Moss.    \"Don't you want to be sociable?\" demanded the tall boy.    \"It isn't that, Flapp. I--I guess I've had enough already.\"    \"Oh, don't be a sissy, Davis. Here, I'll drink with you, and then I'll  smoke a cigar with Moss. If you are going to be men you want to start  right in. Eh, Rockley?\"    \"That's right, Lew,\" answered Rockley, as he lit a fresh cigar.    \"What you need is another glass, Davis,\" came from Pender. \"It will act  as a bracer. Just try it and see.\"    \"I--I don't want to get--get--\" faltered Davis.    \"Get what?\"    \"Intoxicated--really I don't--\"    \"Who said anything about that?\" demanded Lew Flapp in apparent anger.  \"Don't be a fool. One more glass won't hurt you. Here, take it,\" and he  almost forced the liquor to Joe Davis's lips.    But before he could accomplish his wicked design Dick Rover leaped  quickly into the apartment and hurled the glass from the big boy's  hand.    \"For shame, Flapp!\" he cried. \"For shame!\"    \"And that's what I say, too,\" came from Powell, who was close behind Dick.    Every cadet in the room was astonished, and all leaped to their feet.    \"What's up?\" cried Rockley.    \"They have been spying on us!\" came from Jackson.    \"Talk about meanness! This is the limit!\" added Pender.    \"I want you to leave Joe Davis and Harry Moss alone,\" went on Dick, as  calmly as he could. \"It's an outrage to get them to drink and smoke  against their will.\"    \"Are you two alone?\" asked Lew Flapp, glancing nervously over the  newcomers' shoulders.    \"We are.\"    \"What right had you to come here?\"    \"Well, we took the right.\"    \"Then you enjoy playing the spy?\"    \"No, Flapp,\" said Dick boldly, \"but I do enjoy doing Davis and Moss a  favor.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"I mean that I am going to stand by them, so you shall not get them to  drink any more or smoke.\"    \"Humph! What right have you to interfere?\"    \"Maybe he's going to squeal to the captain,\" put in Jackson.    \"If he does that I'll punch his head for him!\" roared Lew Flapp, who  had been drinking just enough to make him ugly and unreasonable.    \"I did not come here to squeal on anybody,\" answered Dick.    \"I know you did--and I'm going to pound you well for it!\" howled Lew  Flapp, and on the instant he leaped forward and aimed a savage blow  with his fist at Dick's head.          CHAPTER XI    A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT      Had the blow landed as intended Dick Rover would have received a bloody  nose and might perhaps have lost one or two teeth.    But Dick was on the alert and he dodged to one side, so the blow landed  on Songbird Powell's shoulder.    \"See here, what do you mean by that, Flapp?\" demanded Powell, who was  no weakling.    \"I meant to hit Rover,\" was the answer.    \"Hands off, Flapp!\" cried Dick. \"I didn't come here to fight, but I can  defend myself.\"    \"We'll see!\" roared the unreasonable tall boy, and made another rush at  Dick. But in a twinkling he found himself flat on the floor, where he  had been thrown with a suddenness that took away his breath.    \"Hi! that ain't fair,\" put in Rockley. \"You let Lew alone.\"    \"I will, when he leaves me alone,\" retorted Dick. He turned to Harry  Moss and Joe Davis. \"Do you want to stay here any longer?\"    \"No,\" answered both of the small cadets promptly.    \"I didn't wish to come at all, but Ben Hurdy urged it,\" continued Harry  Moss.    \"And Pender said it would do no harm,\" added Joe Davis. \"He said we  were going to have nothing but sandwiches, root beer, and soda.\"    \"Look here, Davis, you keep your mouth shut!\" cried Pender. \"You knew  exactly what to expect. You know Mike Sherry don't run a temperance  hotel,\" he continued, with a sneer.    At these words Joe Davis grew pale.    \"Yes, I know it--now, and if I ever get out of it, I shan't come again.\"    \"Oh, you're too good to live!\" broke in Jackson. \"You ought to be laid  away in a glass case for safe keeping.\"    \"Davis is all right, and he has more brains than you, Jackson,\" came  from Dick. \"If you want to make a fool of yourself by drinking and  smoking, I shan't stop you. But you shan't drag Joe and Harry into it  against their will.\"    \"That's the way to talk, Dick,\" said Powell. \"Let us clear out, and  take the youngsters with us.\"    By this time Lew Flap had recovered from the flooring received and now  he approached Dick once more.    \"Do you want me to hammer you good, Rover?\" he panted.    \"As I said before, Flapp, I didn't come here to fight, but I can defend  myself. I propose to leave quietly, and take Harry and Joe with me.\"    \"Supposing I won't let you leave?\"    \"I don't think you'll stop me.\"    \"Come, Flapp, don't make a fool of yourself,\" put in Powell. \"We didn't  come here to quarrel, but to urge all of the crowd to quit drinking.  You know it's against the Hall rules and regulations.\"    \"And you intend to blab on us?\"    \"Not at all. I'm not that kind. And Dick Rover isn't either.\"    \"I know how to fix 'em,\" came from Pender, with a cunning look in his  eye.    \"How?\" asked Flapp and Rockley, in concert.    \"Our word is as good as anybody's. If they say they found us at Mike  Sherry's we can say that we found them there,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#9)"],[1," of Homicide.       | over Ten. |      |    Reported.

In order to appreciate the full importance of this  difference it has to be remembered that in England a great number of  cases of homicide are reported to the police, for which no one is  apprehended or brought to trial. In the case of the notorious  Whitechapel murders which horrified the country a year or two ago no  one was ever brought to trial, hardly any one was arrested or  seriously suspected. These crimes and many others like them materially  augment the number of homicides reported to the police, but they never  figure among the cases annually brought for trial before assizes. As a  matter of fact, no one is ever tried in more than one half of the  cases of homicide reported to the police in the course of the year. In  the year 1888, for instance, 403 cases of homicide were reported to  the police in England and Wales; but in connection with all these  cases only 196 persons were committed for trial. In short, double the  number of homicides are committed as compared with the number of  persons tried; and if a comparison is established between India and  England on the basis of homicides reported to the police, the outcome  of such a comparison will be to show that there are annually more than  twice as many murders committed per one hundred thousand inhabitants  over the age of ten in England than there are in India.    An objection may be taken to these figures on the ground that the  crime of infanticide is much more prevalent to India than it is in  England, and that the perpetrators of this crime are much less  frequently brought to justice in the former country than with us. That  objection is to some extent valid; at the same time it is well to  remember that infanticide in India is an offence of a very special and  peculiar character; the motives from which it springs are not what is  usually understood as criminal; these motives arise from religious  usage and immemorial custom; in short, it is English law and not the  Indian conscience which makes infanticide a crime. Of course, the  practice of infanticide is a proof that the Hindu mind has not the  same high conception of the value of infant life as one finds in the  western world, and in that respect India stands on an inferior moral  level to ourselves. But with the exception of infanticide (and it is  necessary to except it for the reasons I have just alleged) India has  not half as many homicides annually as England.[17]        [17] For the high percentage of infanticide in England see the      evidence given before the House of Lords last July (1890) by      Judges Day and Wills.    To what cause is this vast difference in favour of India to be  attributed? It is hardly probable that the difference is produced to  any appreciable extent, if at all, by the nature of the food used by  the people of India. If it were correct that a vegetable diet, such as  is almost exclusively used by the inhabitants of India, had a salutary  effect on the conduct of the population, we should witness the results  of it, not only in the Indian peninsula, but also in other quarters of  the world. The nature of the food consumed by the Italians bears a  very close resemblance in its essential constituents to the dietary of  the inhabitants of India; in both cases it is almost entirely composed  of vegetable products. If vegetable, as contrasted with animal food,  exercised a beneficial influence on human conduct; if it tended, for  example, to restrain the passions, to minimise the brute instincts,  some indisputable proof of this would be certain to show itself in the  criminal statistics of Italy. As a matter of fact, no such proof  exists. On the contrary, Italy is, of all countries within the pale of  civilisation, the one most notorious for crimes of blood. In the face  of this truth, it is impossible to believe that a vegetable diet has  anything to do either with producing or preventing crime, and the  contention that the wonderful immunity of India from offences against  the person is owing to the food used by the inhabitants must be looked  upon as without foundation.    The peculiar structure of society is unquestionably the most satisfactory  explanation of the high position occupied by the inhabitants of India  with respect to crime. The social edifice which a people builds for  itself is among all civilised communities a highly complex product, and  consists of a great agglomeration of diverse materials. These materials  are partly drawn from the primitive characteristics of the race; they  are partly borrowings from other and contiguous races; they are to a  considerable extent derived from natural surroundings of all kinds;  and in all circumstances they are supplemented by the genius of  individuals. In short, all social structures, when looked at minutely,  are found to be composed of two main ingredients--race and environment;  but these two ingredients are so indissolubly interfused that it is  impossible to say how much is to be attributed to the one, and how much  to the other, in the building up of a society. But if, it is impossible  to estimate the value of the several elements composing the fabric  of society, it is easy to ascertain the dominating idea on which all  forms of society are based. That dominating idea, if it may for the  moment be called such, is the instinct of self-preservation, and it  exercises just as great a power in determining the formation and play  of the social organism as it exercises in determining the attitude of  the individual to the world around him. In working out the idea of  self-preservation into practical forms, the social system of most  peoples has hitherto been built up with a view to protection against  external enemies in the shape of hostile tribes and nations; the  internal enemies of the commonwealth--the thieves, the housebreakers,  the disturbers of public order, the shedders of blood, the perpetrators  of violence--have been treated as only worthy of secondary consideration.  Such are the lines on which social structure has, in most cases,  proceeded, with the result that while external security was for long  periods assured, internal security remained as imperfect and defective  as ever.    The structure of society in India is, however, an exception to the  general rule. External security, or, in other words, the desire for  political freedom has, to a great extent, become extinct wherever the  principles of Brahmanism have succeeded in taking root.    These principles have been operating upon the Indian mind for thousands  of years; their effect in the sphere of politics excited the wonder of  the ancient Greeks, who tell us that the Indian peasant might be seen  tilling his field in peace between hostile armies preparing for battle.  A similar spectacle has been seen on the plains of India in modern  times. But Brahmanism, while extinguishing the principle of liberty in  all its branches, and exposing its adherents to the mercy of every  conqueror, has succeeded, through the caste system, in bringing  internal order, security, and peace to a high pitch of excellence. This  end, the caste system, like most other religious institutions, did not  and does not have directly in view; but the human race often takes  circuitous routes to attain its ends, and while apparently aiming at  one object, is in reality securing another. The permanent forces  operating in society often possess a very different character from  those on the surface, and when the complicated network in which they  are always wrapped up is stripped from off them, we find that they are  some fundamental human instincts at work in disguise.    These observations are applicable to the caste system. This system,  when divested of its externals, besides being an attempt to satisfy  the mystic and emotional elements in the Indian heart, also represents  the genius of the race engaged in the task of self-preservation. The  manner in which caste exercises this function in thus described by Sir  William Hunter in His volume on the Indian Empire. \"Caste or guild,\"  he says, \"exercises a surveillance over each of its members from the  close of childhood until death. If a man behaves well, he will rise to  an honoured place in his caste; and the desire for such local  distinctions exercises an important influence in the life of a Hindu.  But the caste has its punishments as well as its rewards. Those  punishments consist of fine and excommunication. The fine usually  takes the form of a compulsory feast to the male members of the caste.  This is the ordinary means of purification, or of making amends for  breaches of the caste code. Excommunication inflicts three penalties:  First, an interdict against eating with the fellow members of the  caste; second, an interdict against marriage within the caste. This  practically amounts to debarring the delinquent and his family from  respectable marriages of any sort; third, cutting off the delinquent  from the general community by forbidding him the use of the village  barber and washerman, and of the priestly adviser. Except in very  serious cases, excommunication is withdrawn upon the submission of the  offender, and his"]]]
