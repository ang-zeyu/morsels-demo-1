According to Bragi, Hild has a  necklace, which has caused comparison of this story with that of the  Greek Eriphyle. Irish legendary history describes a similar battle  in which the slain revive each night and renew the fight daily, as  occurring in the wanderings of the Tuatha De Danann before they reached  Ireland. According to Keating, they learnt the art of necromancy in  the East, and taught it to the Danes.    The latest edition of the _Gudrun_ is by Ernst Martin (second edition,  Halle, 1902).

The poems of this cycle are four in number--(1) _Hjalmar's  Death-song_: (2) _Angantyr and Hervoer_; (3) _Heidrek's Riddle-Poem_:  (4) _Angantyr the Younger and Hlod_. All are given in the first volume  of the _Corpus_, with translations.    _Herrarar Saga_ was published by Rafn (Copenhagen, 1829-30) in  _Fornaldar Soegur_, vol. i., now out of print. It has been more recently  edited by Dr. Bugge, together with _Voelsunga_ and others. Petersen  (Copenhagen, 1847) edited it with a Danish translation. Munch's  _Nordmuendenes Gudelaere_ (out of print) contains a short abstract.    _Death of Angantyr_. (Page 43.)

The eating of the dragon's heart (see p. 19) may possibly be a survival  of the custom of eating a slain enemy's heart to obtain courage,  of which Dr. Frazer gives examples in the _Golden Bough_.    _Alien Wives_.

See Mr. Gummere's article in the _English Miscellany_; and Professor  Rhys' Presidential Address to the Anthropological Section of the  British Association, 1900. The double relationship between Sigmund  and Sinfjoetli (not uncommon in heroic tales; compare Conchobhar and  Cuchulainn, Arthur and Mordred) seems in this case due to the same  cause as the custom which prevailed in the dynasty of the Ptolemies,  where the king often married his sister, that his heir might be of  the pure royal blood.    _Swanmaids_.  (Page 51.)    See Hartland, _Science of Fairy-Tales._    _The Waverlowe_. (Page 51.)    Dr. Frazer (_Golden Bough_) gives instances of ritual marriages  connected with the midsummer fires. For _Svipdag and Menglad_, see  Study No. 12 of this series. If Rydberg, as seems very probable, is  right in identifying Menglad and Svipdag with Freyja and the mortal  lover who wins her and whom she afterwards loses, the story would  be a parallel to those of Venus and Adonis, Ishtar and Tammuz, &c.,  which Frazer derives from the ritual marriage of human sacrifices to  the Goddess of fertility. The reason given in the Edda for Brynhild's  sleep, and her connexion with Odin, are secondary, arising from the  Valhalla myth.

When the old folks saw  their daughter whom they had lost restored to them, they were beside  themselves with joy, and shed tears for very happiness; and, in their  gratitude, they pressed Gompachi to remain with them, and they  prepared feasts for him, and entertained him hospitably: but their  daughter, who had fallen in love with him for his beauty and knightly  valour, spent her days in thinking of him, and of him alone. The young  man, however, in spite of the kindness of the old merchant, who  wished to adopt him as his son, and tried hard to persuade him to  consent to this, was fretting to go to Yedo and take service as an  officer in the household of some noble lord; so he resisted the  entreaties of the father and the soft speeches of the daughter, and  made ready to start on his journey; and the old merchant, seeing that  he would not be turned from his purpose, gave him a parting gift of  two hundred ounces of silver, and sorrowfully bade him farewell.    [Illustration: GOMPACHI AWAKENED BY THE MAIDEN IN THE ROBBERS' DEN.]    But alas for the grief of the maiden, who sat sobbing her heart out  and mourning over her lover's departure! He, all the while thinking  more of ambition than of love, went to her and comforted her, and  said: \"Dry your eyes, sweetheart, and weep no more, for I shall soon  come back to you. Do you, in the meanwhile, be faithful and true to  me, and tend your parents with filial piety.\"    So she wiped away her tears and smiled again, when she heard him  promise that he would soon return to her. And Gompachi went his way,  and in due time came near to Yedo.    But his dangers were not yet over; for late one night, arriving at a  place called Suzugamori, in the neighbourhood of Yedo, he fell in with  six highwaymen, who attacked him, thinking to make short work of  killing and robbing him. Nothing daunted, he drew his sword, and  dispatched two out of the six; but, being weary and worn out with his  long journey, he was sorely pressed, and the struggle was going hard  with him, when a wardsman,[12] who happened to pass that way riding in  a chair, seeing the affray, jumped down from his chair and drawing his  dirk came to the rescue, and between them they put the robbers to  flight.    [Footnote 12: Japanese cities are divided into wards, and every  tradesman and artisan is under the authority of the chief of the ward  in which he resides. The word _chonin_, or wardsman, is generally used  in contradistinction to the word _samurai_, which has already been  explained as denoting a man belonging to the military class.]    Now it turned out that this kind tradesman, who had so happily come to  the assistance of Gompachi, was no other than Chobei of Bandzuin, the  chief of the _Otokodate_, or Friendly Society of the wardsmen of  Yedo--a man famous in the annals of the city, whose life, exploits,  and adventures are recited to this day, and form the subject of  another tale.    When the highwaymen had disappeared, Gompachi, turning to his  deliverer, said--    \"I know not who you may be, sir, but I have to thank you for rescuing  me from a great danger.\"    And as he proceeded to express his gratitude, Chobei replied--    \"I am but a poor wardsman, a humble man in my way, sir; and if the  robbers ran away, it was more by good luck than owing to any merit of  mine. But I am filled with admiration at the way you fought; you  displayed a courage and a skill that were beyond your years, sir.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the young man, smiling with pleasure at hearing  himself praised; \"I am still young and inexperienced, and am quite  ashamed of my bungling style of fencing.\"    \"And now may I ask you, sir, whither you are bound?\"    \"That is almost more than I know myself, for I am a _ronin,_ and have  no fixed purpose in view.\"    \"That is a bad job,\" said Chobei, who felt pity for the lad. \"However,  if you will excuse my boldness in making such an offer, being but a  wardsman, until you shall have taken service I would fain place my  poor house at your disposal.\"    Gompachi accepted the offer of his new but trusty friend with thanks;  so Chobei led him to his house, where he lodged him and hospitably  entertained him for some months. And now Gompachi, being idle and  having nothing to care for, fell into bad ways, and began to lead a  dissolute life, thinking of nothing but gratifying his whims and  passions; he took to frequenting the Yoshiwara, the quarter of the  town which is set aside for tea-houses and other haunts of wild young  men, where his handsome face and figure attracted attention, and soon  made him a great favourite with all the beauties of the neighbourhood.    About this time men began to speak loud in praise of the charms of  Komurasaki, or \"Little Purple,\" a young girl who had recently come to  the Yoshiwara, and who in beauty and accomplishments outshone all her  rivals. Gompachi, like the rest of the world, heard so much of her  fame that he determined to go to the house where she dwelt, at the  sign of \"The Three Sea-coasts,\" and judge for himself whether she  deserved all that men said of her. Accordingly he set out one day, and  having arrived at \"The Three Sea-coasts,\" asked to see Komurasaki; and  being shown into the room where she was sitting, advanced towards her;  but when their eyes met, they both started back with a cry of  astonishment, for this Komurasaki, the famous beauty of the Yoshiwara,  proved to be the very girl whom several months before Gompachi had  rescued from the robbers' den, and restored to her parents in Mikawa.  He had left her in prosperity and affluence, the darling child of a  rich father, when they had exchanged vows of love and fidelity; and  now they met in a common stew in Yedo. What a change! what a contrast!  How had the riches turned to rust, the vows to lies!    \"What is this?\" cried Gompachi, when he had recovered from his  surprise. \"How is it that I find you here pursuing this vile calling,  in the Yoshiwara? Pray explain this to me, for there is some mystery  beneath all this which I do not understand.\"    But Komurasaki--who, having thus unexpectedly fallen in with her lover  that she had yearned for, was divided between joy and shame--answered,  weeping--    \"Alas! my tale is a sad one, and would be long to tell. After you left  us last year, calamity and reverses fell upon our house; and when my  parents became poverty-stricken, I was at my wits' end to know how to  support them: so I sold this wretched body of mine to the master of  this house, and sent the money to my father and mother; but, in spite  of this, troubles and misfortunes multiplied upon them, and now, at  last, they have died of misery and grief. And, oh! lives there in this  wide world so unhappy a wretch as I! But now that I have met you  again--you who are so strong--help me who am weak. You saved me  once--do not, I implore you, desert me now!!\" and as she told her  piteous tale the tears streamed from her eyes.    \"This is, indeed, a sad story,\" replied Gompachi, much affected by the  recital. \"There must have been a wonderful run of bad luck to bring  such misfortune upon your house, which but a little while ago I  recollect so prosperous. However, mourn no more, for I will not  forsake you. It is true that I am too poor to redeem you from your  servitude, but at any rate I will contrive so that you shall be  tormented no more. Love me, therefore, and put your trust in me.\" When  she heard him speak so kindly she was comforted, and wept no more, but  poured out her whole heart to him, and forgot her past sorrows in the  great joy of meeting him again.    When it became time for them to separate, he embraced her tenderly and  returned to Chobei's house; but he could not banish Komurasaki from  his mind, and all day long he thought of her alone; and so it came  about that he went daily to the Yoshiwara to see her, and if any  accident detained him, she, missing the accustomed visit, would become  anxious and write to him to inquire the cause of his absence. At last,  pursuing this course of life, his stock of money ran short, and as,  being a _ronin_ and without any fixed employment, he had no means of  renewing his supplies, he was ashamed of showing himself penniless at  \"The Three Sea-coasts.\" Then it was that a wicked spirit arose within  him, and he went out and murdered a man, and having robbed him of his  money carried it to the Yoshiwara.    From bad to worse is an easy step, and the tiger that has once tasted  blood is dangerous. Blinded and infatuated by his excessive love,  Gompachi kept on slaying and robbing, so that, while his outer man was  fair to look upon, the heart within him was that of a hideous devil.  At last his friend Chobei could no longer endure the sight of him, and  turned him out of his house; and as, sooner or later, virtue and vice  meet with their reward, it came to pass that Gompachi's crimes became  notorious, and the Government having set spies upon his track, he was  caught red-handed and arrested; and his evil deeds having been fully  proved against him, he was carried off to the execution ground at  Suzugamori, the \"Bell Grove,\" and beheaded as a common male-factor.    Now when Gompachi was dead, Chobei's old affection for the young man  returned, and, being a kind and pious man, he went and claimed his  body and head, and buried him at Meguro, in the grounds of the Temple  called Boronji.    When Komurasaki heard the people at Yoshiwara gossiping about her  lover's end, her grief knew no bounds, so she fled secretly from \"The  Three Sea-coasts,\" and came to Meguro and threw herself upon the  newly-made grave. Long she prayed and bitterly she wept over the tomb  of him whom, with all his faults, she had loved so well, and then,"]]]
