[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1216"],[0,"Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes (#9)"],[1,"of becoming a member of the Royal  Society. I should conjecture, from some of these applications, that it  is not very unusual for gentlemen in the country to order their agents  in London to take measures for putting them up at the Royal Society.          SECTION 2. OF THE PRESIDENCY AND VICE-PRESIDENCIES.    Why Mr. Davies Gilbert became President of the Royal Society I cannot  precisely say. Let him who penned, and those who supported this  resolution solve the enigma:    \"It was Resolved,    \"That it is the opinion of the Council that Davies Gilbert, Esq. is by  far the most fit person to be proposed to the Society at the approaching  anniversary as President, and that he be recommended accordingly.\"    To resolve that he was a FIT person might have been sufficiently  flattering: to state that he was the most fit, was a little hard upon  the rest of the Society; but to resolve that he was \"BY FAR THE MOST  FIT\" was only consistent with that strain of compliment in which his  supporters indulge, and was a eulogy, by no means unique in its kind, I  believe, even at that very Council.    That Mr. Gilbert is a most amiable and kind-hearted man will be  instantly admitted by all who are, in the least degree, acquainted with  him: that he is fit for the chair of the Royal Society, will be allowed  by few, except those who have committed themselves to the above-quoted  resolution.    Possessed of knowledge and of fortune more than sufficient for it, he  might have been the restorer of its lustre. He might have called round  him, at the council board, those most actively engaged in the pursuits  of science, most anxious for the improvement of the Royal Society.  Instead of himself proposing resolutions, he might have been, what a  chairman ought to be, the organ of the body over which he presides. By  the firmness of his own conduct he might have taught the subordinate  officers of the Society the duties of their station. Instead of paying  compliments to Ministers, who must have smiled at his simplicity, he  might have maintained the dignity of his Council by the dignity of  knowledge.    But he has chosen a different path; with no motives of interest  to allure, or of ambition to betray him, instead of making himself  respected as the powerful chief of a united republic,--that of  science,--he has grasped at despotic power, and stands the feeble  occupant of its desolated kingdom, trembling at the force of opinions  he might have directed, and refused even the patronage of their names by  those whose energies he might have commanded.    Mr. Gilbert told the Society he accepted the situation for a year; and  this circumstance caused a difficulty in finding a Treasurer: an office  which he had long held, and to which he wished to return.    Another difficulty might have arisen, from the fact of the late Board  of Longitude comprising amongst its Members the PRESIDENT of the Royal  Society, and three of its Fellows, appointed by the President and  Council. Of course, when Mr. Gilbert accepted the higher situation, he  became, EX OFFICIO, a Member of the Board of Longitude; and a vacancy  occurred, which ought to have been filled up by the President and  Council. But when this subject was brought before them, in defiance of  common sense, and the plain meaning of the act of parliament, which had  enacted that the Board of Longitude should have the assistance of four  persons belonging to the Royal Society, Mr. Gilbert refused to allow  it to be filled up, on the ground that he should not be President next  year, and had made no vacancy.    Next year Mr. Gilbert wished again to be President one other year; but  the Board of Longitude was dissolved, otherwise we might have had some  LOCUM TENENS to retire at Mr. Gilbert's pleasure.    These circumstances are in themselves of trifling importance, but they  illustrate the character of the proceedings: and it is not becoming  the dignity of science or of the Society that its officers should be so  circumstanced as to have an apparent and direct interest in supporting  the existing President, in order to retain their own places; and if  such a system is once discovered, doubt immediately arises as to the  frequency of such arrangements.          SECTION 3. OF THE SECRETARISHIPS.    Whether the present Secretaries are the best qualified to aid in  reforming the Society, is a question I shall not discuss. With regard  to the senior Secretary, the time of his holding office is perhaps more  unfortunate than the circumstance. If I might be permitted to allude  for a moment to his personal character, I should say that the mild  excellencies of his heart have prevented the Royal Society from deriving  the whole of that advantage from his varied knowledge and liberal  sentiments which some might perhaps have anticipated; and many will  agree with me in regretting that his judgment has not directed a larger  portion of the past deeds of the Councils of the Royal Society. Of the  junior Secretary I shall only observe, that whilst I admit his industry,  his perseverance, and his talents, I regret to see such valuable  qualities exerted at a disadvantage, and that I sincerely wish them  all the success they merit in situations more adapted for their  developement.    There are, however, some general principles which it may be important to  investigate, which relate to the future as well as to the past state of  the office of Secretary of the Royal Society. Inconvenience has already  arisen from having had at a former period one of our Secretaries the  conductor of a scientific journal; and this is one of the points in  which I can agree with those who now manage the affairs of the Society.  [These observations were written previous to the late appointment, to  which I now devote Section 6. Experience seems to be lost on the Council  of the Royal Society.] Perhaps it might be advantageous to extend the  same understanding to the other officers of the Society at least, if not  to the members of its Council.    Another circumstance worthy of the attention of the Society is, to  consider whether it is desirable, except in special cases, to have  military persons appointed to any of its offices. There are several  peculiarities in the military character, which, though they do not  absolutely unfit their possessors for the individual prosecution of  science, may in some degree disqualify such persons from holding offices  in scientific institutions. The habits both of obedience and command,  which are essential in military life, are little fitted for that perfect  freedom which should reign in the councils of science. If a military  chief commit an oversight or an error, it is necessary, in order to  retain the confidence of those he commands, to conceal or mask it as  much as possible. If an experimentalist make a mistake, his only course  to win the confidence of his fellow-labourers in science, and to render  his future observations of any use, is to acknowledge it in the most  full and explicit manner. The very qualifications which contribute to  the professional excellence of the soldier, constitute his defects when  he enters the paths of science; and it is only in those rare cases where  the force of genius is able to control and surmount these habits,  that his admission to the offices of science can be attended with any  advantage to it.    Another objection deserving notice, although not applying exclusively to  the military profession, is, that persons not imbued with the feelings  of men of science, when they have published their observations, are too  apt to view every criticism upon them as a personal question, and  to consider that it is as offensive to doubt the accuracy of their  observations as it is to doubt their word. Nothing can be more injurious  to science than that such an opinion should be tolerated. The most  unreserved criticism is necessary for truth; and those suspicions  respecting his own accuracy, which every philosophical experimenter will  entertain concerning his own researches, ought never to be considered as  a reproach, when they are kept in view in examining the experiments of  others. The minute circumstances and apparently trivial causes which  lend their influence towards error, even in persons of the most candid  judgment, are amongst the most curious phenomena of the human mind.    The importance of affording every aid to enable others to try the merits  of observations, has been so well expressed by Mayer, that I shall  conclude these remarks with an extract from the Preface to his  Observations:    \"Officii enim cujusque observatoris ease reor, de habitu instrumenti  sui, de cura ac precautione, qua usus est, ad illud recte tractandum,  deque mediis in errores ejus inquirendi rationem reddere publice, ut  aliis quoque copia sit judicandi, quanta fides habenda conclusionibus ex  nostris observationibus deductis aut deducendis. Hoc cum minus fecissent  precedentis saeculi astronomi, praxin nimis secure, nimisque theoretice  tractantes, factum inde potissimum est, ut illorum observationes tot  vigiliis tantoque labore comparatae tam cito obsoleverint.\" P. viii.    There are certain duties which the Royal Society owes to its own  character as well as to the public, which, having been on some occasions  apparently neglected, it may be here the proper place to mention,  since it is reasonable to suppose that attention to them is within the  province of its Secretaries.    The first to which I shall allude is the singular circumstances  attending the fact of the Royal Society having printed a volume  of Astronomical Observations which were made at the Observatory of  Paramatta (New South Wales), bearing the title of \"The Third Part of the  Philosophical Transactions for the Year 1829.\"    Now this Observatory was founded at the private expense of a British  officer; the instruments were paid for out of his purse; two observers  were brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#9)"],[1,"himself; judging of the state of  his loved one's feelings by his own desires. But yet,      The stolen glance with half-averted eye,    The hesitating gait, the quick rebuke    Addressed to her companion, who would fain    Have stayed her counterfeit departure; these    Are signs not unpropitious to my suit.    So eagerly the lover feeds his hopes,    Claiming each trivial gesture for his own.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                       [_Still in the same attitude_.    Ah, friends, my hands cannot move to greet you with the usual  salutation. I can only just command my lips to wish your Majesty  victory.    KING.    Why, what has paralysed your limbs?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    You might as well ask me how my eye comes to water after you have  poked your finger into it.    KING.    I don't understand you; speak more intelligibly.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Ah, my dear friend, is yonder upright reed transformed into a  crooked plant by its own act, or by the force of the current?    KING.    The current of the river causes it, I suppose.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Ay; just as you are the cause of my crippled limbs.    KING.    How so?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Here are you living the life of a wild man of the woods in a  savage unfrequented region, while your State-affairs are left to  shift for themselves; and as for poor me, I am no longer master  of my own limbs, but have to follow you about day after day in  your chases after wild animals, till my bones are all crippled  and out of joint. Do, my dear friend, let me have one day's rest.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    This fellow little knows, while he talks in this manner, that my  mind is wholly engrossed by recollections of the hermit's  daughter, and quite as disinclined to the chase as his own.      No longer can I bend my well-braced bow    Against the timid deer; nor e'er again    With well-aimed arrows can I think to harm    These her beloved associates, who enjoy    The privilege of her companionship;    Teaching her tender glances in return.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                         [_Looking in the King's face_.    I may as well speak to the winds, for any attention you pay to my  requests. I suppose you have something on your mind, and are  talking it over to yourself.    KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.    I was only thinking that I ought not to disregard a friend's  request.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Then may the King live for ever!                                                        [_Moves off_.    KING.    Stay a moment, my dear friend. I have something else to say to  you.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Say on, then.    KING.    When you have rested, you must assist me in another business  which will give you no fatigue.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    In eating something nice, I hope.    KING.    You shall know at some future time.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    No time better than the present.    KING.    What ho, there!    WARDER.                                              [_Entering_.    What are your Majesty's commands?    KING.    O Raivatika, bid the General of the forces attend.    WARDER.    I will, Sire.    [_Exit and re-enters with the_ GENERAL.]    Come forward, General; his Majesty is looking towards you, and  has some order to give you.    GENERAL.                                  [_Looking at the_ KING.    Though hunting is known to produce ill effects, my royal master  has derived only benefit from it. For      Like the majestic elephant that roams    O'er mountain wilds, so does the King display    A stalwart frame, instinct with vigorous life.    His brawny arms and manly chest are scored    By frequent passage of the sounding string;    Unharmed he bears the midday sun; no toil    His mighty spirit daunts; his sturdy limbs,    Stripped of redundant flesh, relinquish nought    Of their robust proportions, but appear    In muscle, nerve, and sinewy fibre cased.                                             [_Approaching the_ KING.    Victory to the King! We have tracked the wild beasts to their  lairs in the forest. Why delay, when everything is ready?    KING.    My friend Ma[T.]Havya here has been disparaging the  chase, till he has taken away all my relish for it.    GENERAL.                                   [_Aside to_ MA[T.]HAVYA.    Persevere in your opposition, my good fellow; I will sound the  King's real feelings, and humour him accordingly.                                                            [_Aloud_.    The blockhead talks nonsense, and your Majesty in your own person  furnishes the best proof of it. Observe, Sire, the advantage and  pleasure the hunter derives from the chase.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                            [_Angrily_.    Away! tempter, away! The King has recovered his senses, and is  himself again. As for you, you may, if you choose, wander about  from forest to forest, till some old bear seizes you by the nose,  and makes a mouthful of you.    KING.    My good General, as we are just now in the neighbourhood of a  consecrated grove, your panegyric upon hunting is somewhat  ill-timed, and I cannot assent to all you have said. For the  present,      All undisturbed the buffaloes shall sport    In yonder pool, and with their ponderous horns    Scatter its tranquil waters, while the deer,    Couched here and there in groups beneath the shade    Of spreading branches, ruminate in peace.    And all securely shall the herd of boars    Feed on the marshy sedge; and thou, my bow,    With slackened string, enjoy a long repose.    GENERAL.    So please your Majesty, it shall be as you desire.    KING.    Recall, then, the beaters who were sent in advance to surround  the forest. My troops must not be allowed to disturb this sacred  retreat, and irritate its pious inhabitants.      Know that within the calm and cold recluse    Lurks unperceived a germ of smothered flame,    All-potent to destroy; a latent fire    That rashly kindled bursts with fury forth;    As in the disc of crystal[35] that remains    Cool to the touch, until the solar ray    Falls on its polished surface, and excites    The burning heat that lies within concealed.    GENERAL.    Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Off with you, you son of a slave! Your nonsense won't go down  here, my fine fellow.                                                     [_Exit_ GENERAL.    KING.                               [_Looking at his attendants_.    Here, women, take my hunting-dress; and you, Raivatika, keep  guard carefully outside.    ATTENDANTS.    We will, Sire.                                                           [_Exeunt_.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Now that you have got rid of these plagues, who have been buzzing  about us like so many flies, sit down, do, on that stone slab,  with the shade of the tree as your canopy, and I will seat myself  by you quite comfortably.    KING.    Go you, and sit down first.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Come along, then.                   [_Both walk on a little way, and seat themselves_.    KING.    Ma[T.]Havya, it may be said of you that you have never beheld  anything worth seeing; for your eyes have not yet looked upon the  loveliest object in creation.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    How can you say so, when I see your Majesty before me at this  moment?    KING.    It is very natural that every one should consider his own friend  perfect; but I was alluding to [S']akoontala, the brightest  ornament of these hallowed groves.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                              [_Aside_.    I understand well enough, but I am not going to humour him.                                                            [_Aloud_.    If, as you intimate, she is a hermit's daughter, you cannot  lawfully ask her in marriage. You may as well then dismiss her  from your mind, for any good the mere sight of her can do.    KING.    Think you that a descendant of the mighty Puru could fix his  affections on an unlawful object?      Though, as men say, the offspring of the sage,    The maiden to a nymph celestial owes    Her being, and by her mother left on earth,    Was found and nurtured by the holy man    As his own daughter, in this hermitage.    So, when dissevered from its parent stalk,    Some falling blossom of the jasmine[36], wafted    Upon the sturdy sun-flower, is preserved    By its support from premature decay.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                            [_Smiling_.    This passion of yours for a rustic maiden, when you have so many  gems of women at home in your palace, seems to me very like the  fancy of a man who is tired of sweet dates, and longs for sour  tamarinds as a variety.    KING.    You have not seen her, or you would not talk in this fashion.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    I can quite understand it must require something surpassingly  attractive to excite the admiration of such a great man as you.    KING.    I will describe her, my dear friend, in a few words,      Man's all-wise Maker, wishing to create    A faultless form, whose matchless symmetry    Should far transcend Creation's choicest works,    Did call together by his mighty will,    And garner up in his eternal mind,    A bright assemblage of all lovely things;    And then, as in a picture, fashion them    Into one perfect and ideal form--    Such the divine, the wondrous prototype,    Whence her fair shape was moulded into being.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    If that's the case, she must indeed throw all other beauties into  the shade.    KING.    To my mind she really does.      This peerless maid is like a fragrant flower,    Whose perfumed breath has never been diffused;    A tender bud, that no profaning hand    Has dared to sever from its parent stalk;    A gem of priceless water, just released    Pure and unblemished from its glittering bed.    Or may the maiden haply be compared    To sweetest honey, that no mortal lip    Has sipped; or, rather, to the mellowed fruit    Of virtuous actions in some"]]]
