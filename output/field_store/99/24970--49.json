What a very pleasant thing that was for Solomon, to be sure! And how  glad one would be nowadays to have such knowledge!    Solomon was especially fond of birds, and loved to talk with them  because their voices were so sweet and they spoke such beautiful words.  One day the wise King was chatting pleasantly with the birds who lived  in his wonderful garden, and these are some of the things which he heard  them say. The Nightingale, the sweetest singer of all, chanted,--    \"Contentment is the greatest happiness.\"    \"It would be better for most people never to have been born,\" crooned  the melancholy Turtle-Dove.    The happy little Swallow gave her opinion,--\"Do good and you will be  rewarded hereafter.\"    The harsh cry of the Peacock meant, \"As thou judgest so shalt thou be  judged.\"    The Hoopoe said, \"He who has no pity for others will find none for  himself.\"    The cynical old Crow croaked disagreeably, \"The further away from men I  am, the better I am pleased.\"    Last of all the Cock who sings in the morning chanted his joyous  song,--\"Think of your Creator, O foolish creatures!\"    When they had finished talking King Solomon softly stroked the head of  the pretty little Dove and bade her cheer up, for life was not so  dreadful a thing, after all. And he gave her permission to build her  nest under the walls of the great Temple which he was building, the most  beautiful, golden house in the whole world. Some years afterward the  Doves had so increased in numbers that with their extended wings they  formed a veil over the numberless pilgrims who came to Jerusalem to  visit the wonderful Temple.    But of all the winged singers who spoke that day in the garden, the wise  King chose to have ever near him the Cock, because he had spoken words  of piety, and the nimble Hoopoe, because he was able to plunge his  clear gaze into the depths of the earth as if it were made of  transparent glass and discover the places where springs of living water  were hidden under the soil. It was very convenient for Solomon, when he  was traveling, to have some one with him who was able to find water in  whatsoever place he might be resting.    Thus the Cock and the Hoopoe became Solomon's closest companions; but of  the two the Hoopoe was his favorite. The Hoopoe is an Eastern bird and  we do not see him in America. He is about as big as a Jay, colored a  beautiful reddish gray, with feathers of purple, brown, and white, and  his black wings are banded with white. But the peculiar thing about a  Hoopoe is his crown of tawny feathers, a tall crown for so small a bird.  And this is the story of the Hoopoe's crown.           *       *       *       *       *    One day when Solomon was journeying across the desert, he was sorely  distressed by the heat of the sun, until he came near to fainting. Just  then he spied a flock of his friends the Hoopoes flying past, and  calling to them feebly he begged them to shelter him from the burning  rays.    The King of the Hoopoes gathered together his whole nation and caused  them to fly in a thick cloud over the head of Solomon while he  continued his journey. In gratitude the wise King offered to give his  feathered friends whatever reward they might ask.    For a whole day the Hoopoes talked the matter over among themselves,  then their King came to Solomon and said to him,--    \"We have considered your offer, O generous King, and we have decided  that what we most desire is to have, each of us, a golden crown on his  head.\"    King Solomon smiled and answered, \"Crowns of gold shall you have. But  you are foolish birds, my Hoopoes; and when the evil days shall come  upon you and you see the folly of your desire, return here to me and I  will help you yet again.\"    So the King of the Hoopoes left King Solomon with a beautiful golden  crown upon his head. And soon all the Hoopoes were wearing golden  crowns. Thereupon they grew very proud and haughty. They went down by  the lakes and pools and strutted there that they might admire themselves  in the water mirrors. And the Queen of the Hoopoes became very airy, and  refused to speak to her own cousin and to the other birds who had once  been her friends.    There was a certain fowler who used to set traps for birds. He put a  piece of broken mirror into his trap, and a Hoopoe spying it went in to  admire herself, and was caught. The fowler looked at the shining crown  upon her head and said, \"What have we here! I never saw a crown like  this upon any bird. I must ask about this.\"    So he took the crown to Issachar, the worker in metal, and asked him  what it was. Issachar examined it carefully, and his eyes stuck out of  his head. But he said carelessly, \"It is a crown of brass, my friend. I  will give you a quarter of a shekel for it; and if you find any more  bring them to me. But be sure to tell no other man of the matter.\" (A  shekel was about sixty-two cents.)    After this the fowler caught many Hoopoes in the same way, and sold  their crowns to Issachar. But one day as he was on his way to the  metalworker's shop he met a jeweler, and to him he showed one of the  Hoopoes' crowns.    \"What is this, and where did you find it?\" exclaimed the jeweler. \"It is  pure gold. I will give you a golden talent for every four you bring me.\"  (A talent was worth three hundred shekels.)    Now when the value of the Hoopoes' crowns was known, every one turned  fowler and began to hunt the precious birds. In all the land of Israel  was heard the twang of bows and the whirling of slings. Bird lime was  made in every town, and the price of traps rose in the market so that  the trap-makers became rich men. Not a Hoopoe could show his unlucky  head without being slain or taken captive, and the days of the Hoopoes  were numbered. It seemed that soon there would be no more Hoopoes left  to bewail their sad fate.    At last the few who still lived gathered together and held a meeting to  consider what should be done, for their minds were filled with sorrow  and dismay. And they decided to appeal once more to King Solomon, who  had granted their foolish prayer.    Flying by stealth through the loneliest ways, the unhappy King of the  Hoopoes came at last to the court of the King, and stood once more  before the steps of his golden throne. With tears and groans he related  the sad fortune which had befallen his golden-crowned race.    King Solomon looked kindly upon the King of the Hoopoes and said,  \"Behold, did I not warn you of your folly in desiring to have crowns of  gold? Vanity and pride have been your ruin. But now, that there may be a  memorial of the service which once you did me, your crowns of gold shall  be changed into crowns of feathers, and with them you may walk unharmed  upon the earth.\"    In this way the remaining Hoopoes were saved. For when the fowlers saw  that they no longer wore crowns of gold upon their heads, they ceased to  hunt them as they had been doing. And from that time forth the family of  the Hoopoes have flourished and increased in peace, even to the present  day.           *       *       *       *       *    Solomon was ever seeking to grow even wiser. The better to know the  wonders of God's world and the ways of all creatures, he undertook many  journeys,--not as we ordinary poor mortals travel, in heavy wagons or  clumsy boats, by dusty roads or stormy waves. It was in no such  troublous ways that Solomon the all-powerful traversed space and reached  the uttermost corners of the earth. Thanks to his great knowledge, he  had discovered a means of locomotion compared to which the most  magnificent railway coaches and the richest palanquins of Indian princes  would seem poor indeed. He had caused his Genii to make a silken carpet  of four leagues in extent. In the midst of this carpet was placed a  magnificent throne for the royal traveler himself; and around it were  seats of gold, of silver, of wood, for the multitude of persons of  different rank whom he took with him. There was also no lack of the most  gorgeous furniture and the necessary provisions for a king's traveling  banquet.    When all was ready Solomon was wont to seat himself upon his throne, and  would command the winds to do their duty. Immediately they gently lifted  the carpet and bore it rapidly through the air to the appointed spot.  During the journey, above the aerial caravan fluttered a cloud of birds,  who with their wings formed a splendid canopy to shield their beloved  lord from the sun's heat, as the Hoopoes had first done.    One day, while on such a journey, Solomon was shocked to feel a ray of  sunlight piercing through this plumy dais which overhung his head.  Shading his eyes, the King glanced up and perceived that there was an  opening in the canopy. One bird was missing from its post. In great  displeasure Solomon demanded of the Eagle the name of the truant.  Anxiously the Eagle called the roll of all the birds in his company; and  he was horrified to find that it was Solomon's favorite, the Hoopoe, who  was missing. With terror he announced the bird's desertion to the most  wise King.    \"Soar aloft,\" commanded Solomon sternly, \"and find the Hoopoe that I may  punish him. I will pluck off his feathers that he may feel the  scorching heat of the sun as his carelessness has caused me to do.\"    The Eagle soared heavenward, until the earth beneath him looked like a  bowl turned upside down. Then he poised on level wings and looked around  in every direction to discover the truant. Soon he espied the Hoopoe  flying swiftly from the south. The Eagle swooped down and would have  seized the culprit roughly in his strong talons, but the Hoopoe begged  him for Solomon's sake to be gentle.    \"For Solomon's sake!\" cried the Eagle. \"Do you dare to name"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#9)"],[1,"th,  whence assistance could be sent out to the remainder. For this purpose it  was necessary that all those who accompanied me should be good walkers  and resolute men; for if any accident happened to the portion of the  party I took with me, arising either from want of energy, want of  discipline, or any other causes, that portion of the party which remained  behind would have been reduced to the last extremity.    DIVIDE THE PARTY, AND PROCEED WITH THE STRONGEST TO PERTH FOR ASSISTANCE.  ARRANGEMENTS AT STARTING.    Having formed this resolution, it became necessary to make a selection of  those who were to accompany me. In determining however upon this point I  had but little difficulty; for it was evident that those men who during  our late toils had shown themselves the most capable of enduring  hardships, privations, and the fatigue of long and rapid marches, were  those who were the best suited for the service I now destined them for.  The following was the division I made of the party: I named:    Corporal Auger,  Corporal Coles,  H. Woods,  W. Hackney,  Kaiber, the native,    as those who were to accompany me, and left the remainder under the  command of Mr. Walker.    EMBARRASSMENT REGARDING THE CHART.    In making my arrangements with Mr. Walker a very serious difficulty arose  upon his part, and one from which I immediately augured the worst of  consequences. On quitting the boats I brought away with me Captain King's  chart of the coast between North-west Cape and Cape Leeuwin, and had  hitherto carried it along with my papers and sketches. I wished Mr.  Walker to take this chart with him for the purpose of recognising his  position by means of the islands and headlands as he advanced along the  coast. No inducements upon my part could however persuade him to take  charge of it. It was in vain that I urged on him the well known fact that  nothing encourages men in a long journey so much as knowing the exact  distance they have travelled and what extent of country they have still  left to traverse. It was in vain that I assured him he would, from his  inexperience in calculating distances in the bush, soon get confused in  his reckoning; and that the men, finding out his error, would lose all  trust and confidence in him, whence would spring want of discipline and  disorders of various kinds; he knew that I much valued this chart and had  apparently taken it into his head that I wished to disencumber myself of  it and to entail the duty of carrying it on him.    He at length proposed to me to allow him to cut the chart up, in which  case he said he would carry on the part he wanted and leave the rest. I  would not however part with so valuable a document, for it contained my  route up to that point, and the public utility of the expedition mainly  depended on the preservation of it. He next requested me to make a copy  of it for him; this I assured him under existing circumstances it was  utterly impossible for me to do with sufficient accuracy to answer the  intended purpose, and I therefore would not attempt it. He then applied  to Mr. Smith, who coincided in my opinion; but ever willing to oblige he  made as accurate a copy as he could, which I in vain represented to Mr.  Walker he would find utterly useless. His unreasonable reluctance however  I could not overcome.    POINT OF RENDEZVOUS FIXED.    The next matter to arrange was what place should be fixed on as the point  of rendezvous to which assistance was to be sent to those who were left  to follow with Mr. Walker. This was soon arranged. Mr. Smith had  previously been with me to a place called Goonmarrarup, on the Moore  River about fifty-five miles to the north of Perth; and it was agreed  that the party should proceed along the coast as they best could until  they made the Moore River, where I would have another party stationed  with provisions to meet them; and in order that they might not pass this  river it was settled that the party who went out to meet them should  separate into two, one of which would remain at this point on the Moore  River, about twelve miles from the sea, whilst the other was to proceed  down to it, leaving, besides their tracks, marks to show where they had  passed; and then, in the event of not finding those they were in search  of, this last detachment was to push still further northward to look for  them.    As soon as the arrangements were concluded I assembled the men and  publicly repeated these directions to them; and to such as Clotworthy I  addressed strong admonitions as to their future conduct. Many of them did  not appear to be in the least aware of the critical situation they were  placed in; I however entertained great fears for the safety of some of  them. Poor Smith was at this time in a very delicate state of health, and  his courage and gentleness had so endeared him to me that the sight of  his sickly face made me long to be on the march to send out help to him.  For Mr. Walker I had no fear; I have never known anyone endowed with a  greater degree of patient endurance; indeed had he not, from a mistaken  good nature, been too familiar with the men, no one could have been more  admirably adapted for the trying position in which he was placed; and  even as events turned out I doubt if anyone could have been found who  would have endured more, or would have gone through greater exertions to  save those under his command.    The party I left, and who were not required to proceed by forced marches,  consisted of:    Mr. Walker,  Mr. Smith,  Thomas Ruston,  C. Woods,  T. Stiles,  A. Clotworthy.    SEPARATION OF THE PARTY. ADVICE TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND.    Before parting with Mr. Walker and Mr. Smith I again urged them to push  steadily onwards and never to idle for an instant; but I do not think  that either of them were fully aware of the dangers they had to contend  with. Poor Smith, as he squeezed my hand, begged me to send out a horse  for him, if one could be procured, and also some tobacco; he said the  only thing he dreaded was want of water.    Mr. Walker smiled and told me to look out for myself that he was not in  Perth before me, and several others seemed to participate in his feeling  and to regard my plan of proceeding as the height of folly.    I left with Mr. Walker's party everything that was really useful, such as  the cooking saucepan and the only hatchet we had. These were very  valuable to them, for had they come into a grass-tree country they might  have subsisted for a long time upon the tops of these trees, as Mr.  Elliott did upon a former occasion; for he together with two men lived  upon them for fourteen days. This very useful implement they however  threw away the second day after we parted. We also left them all the  fishing-hooks.    Mr. Walker's party instantly commenced on the system of halting, and  instead of moving on in the afternoon remained where they were that day  for the purpose of resting themselves.    The country we travelled over for the first two miles was pretty good,  being a series of grassy plains. At this point we came to a belt of thick  wood which we found exceedingly difficult to traverse. We then continued  our south by east course for four miles further over undulating sandy  downs, and halted for the night in a small clump of Banksia trees which  afforded plenty of wood for our fires.    April 11.    About an hour before daylight I roused the party, and as soon as it was  light enough to distinguish the surrounding objects we started. Our route  lay along a series of undulating sandy hills which sloped down to a  fertile plain, four or five miles in width, on the western side of which  rose a low range of dunes, and beyond these was the sea. We found the  walking along these hills very difficult on account of the prickly scrub  with which they were covered, and the general appearance of the country  to the eastward was barren and unpromising.    COURSE IMPEDED BY A THICK WOOD.    The course I pursued was about south by east, but we soon found ourselves  embarrassed in thick woods through which it was almost impossible to  force a way: the trees were not large but so matted together that it  required my utmost exertions to prevail upon the men to persist in  pushing through them, indeed it will afterwards be found that these woods  had a most disastrous effect upon the spirits of that portion of the  party which followed me. It was however absolutely necessary to make our  way through one of these which formed a belt of nearly a mile in width,  running almost east and west as far as the eye could see in each  direction.    I therefore gave a bold plunge into the bushes, followed by the native  and slowly by the other men, who kept alternately groaning from fatigue  and pain and uttering imprecations against the country they were in.  Having cleared this wood I turned rather more inland, and we pursued our  route over barren scrubby plains, and, after having travelled about  fifteen miles over this uninteresting description of country, we suddenly  found ourselves on the top of a low range which overlooked a most  luxuriant valley of about three miles in width, its general direction  appearing to be from the east-south-east.    THE ARROWSMITH RIVER.    I immediately knew from the appearance of the country that we were near  some large river; and whilst descending into the valley I indulged in  speculations as to the size of that we were about to discover, and as to  whether Providence would grant me once again to drink a draught of cool  river water.    I soon however began to fear that my expectations were to be  disappointed. We had already proceeded more than two miles of the  distance across the valley; and although the soil was rich and good we  had yet seen nothing but dry watercourses, inconsiderable in themselves  yet apparently when united forming a large river. I still however  entertained hopes of finding water, for I saw numerous "]]]
