The first is free to us; we're governed by the second.    FAUST    In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned?  That's well! So might a compact be  Made with you gentlemen--and binding,--surely?    MEPHISTOPHELES    All that is promised shall delight thee purely;  No skinflint bargain shalt thou see.  But this is not of swift conclusion;  We'll talk about the matter soon.  And now, I do entreat this boon--  Leave to withdraw from my intrusion.    FAUST    One moment more I ask thee to remain,  Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Release me, now! I soon shall come again;  Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me.    FAUST    I have not snares around thee cast;  Thyself hast led thyself into the meshes.  Who traps the Devil, hold him fast!  Not soon a second time he'll catch a prey so precious.    MEPHISTOPHELES    An't please thee, also I'm content to stay,  And serve thee in a social station;  But stipulating, that I may  With arts of mine afford thee recreation.    FAUST    Thereto I willingly agree,  If the diversion pleasant be.    MEPHISTOPHELES    My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences,  More in this hour to soothe thy senses,  Than in the year's monotony.  That which the dainty spirits sing thee,  The lovely pictures they shall bring thee,  Are more than magic's empty show.  Thy scent will be to bliss invited;  Thy palate then with taste delighted,  Thy nerves of touch ecstatic glow!  All unprepared, the charm I spin:  We're here together, so begin!    SPIRITS         Vanish, ye darking       Arches above him!       Loveliest weather,       Born of blue ether,       Break from the sky!       O that the darkling       Clouds had departed!       Starlight is sparkling,       Tranquiller-hearted       Suns are on high.       Heaven's own children       In beauty bewildering,       Waveringly bending,       Pass as they hover;       Longing unending       Follows them over.       They, with their glowing       Garments, out-flowing,       Cover, in going,       Landscape and bower,       Where, in seclusion,       Lovers are plighted,       Lost in illusion.       Bower on bower!       Tendrils unblighted!       Lo! in a shower       Grapes that o'ercluster       Gush into must, or       Flow into rivers       Of foaming and flashing       Wine, that is dashing       Gems, as it boundeth       Down the high places,       And spreading, surroundeth       With crystalline spaces,       In happy embraces,       Blossoming forelands,       Emerald shore-lands!       And the winged races       Drink, and fly onward--       Fly ever sunward       To the enticing       Islands, that flatter,       Dipping and rising       Light on the water!       Hark, the inspiring       Sound of their quiring!       See, the entrancing       Whirl of their dancing!       All in the air are       Freer and fairer.       Some of them scaling       Boldly the highlands,       Others are sailing,       Circling the islands;       Others are flying;       Life-ward all hieing,--       All for the distant       Star of existent       Rapture and Love!    MEPHISTOPHELES    He sleeps! Enough, ye fays! your airy number  Have sung him truly into slumber:  For this performance I your debtor prove.--  Not yet art thou the man, to catch the Fiend and hold him!--  With fairest images of dreams infold him,  Plunge him in seas of sweet untruth!  Yet, for the threshold's magic which controlled him,  The Devil needs a rat's quick tooth.  I use no lengthened invocation:  Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation.    The lord of rats and eke of mice,  Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice,  Summons thee hither to the door-sill,  To gnaw it where, with just a morsel  Of oil, he paints the spot for thee:--  There com'st thou, hopping on to me!  To work, at once! The point which made me craven  Is forward, on the ledge, engraven.  Another bite makes free the door:  So, dream thy dreams, O Faust, until we meet once more!    FAUST _(awaking)_    Am I again so foully cheated?  Remains there naught of lofty spirit-sway,  But that a dream the Devil counterfeited,  And that a poodle ran away?    [Illustration]          IV      THE STUDY    FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES    FAUST    A knock? Come in! Again my quiet broken?    MEPHISTOPHELES    'Tis I!    FAUST             Come in!    MEPHISTOPHELES                      Thrice must the words be spoken.    FAUST    Come in, then!      MEPHISTOPHELES                       Thus thou pleasest me.  I hope we'll suit each other well;  For now, thy vapors to dispel,  I come, a squire of high degree,  In scarlet coat, with golden trimming,  A cloak in silken lustre swimming,  A tall cock's-feather in my hat,  A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,--  And I advise thee, brief and flat,  To don the self-same gay apparel,  That, from this den released, and free,  Life be at last revealed to thee!    FAUST    This life of earth, whatever my attire,  Would pain me in its wonted fashion.  Too old am I to play with passion;  Too young, to be without desire.  What from the world have I to gain?  Thou shalt abstain--renounce--refrain!  Such is the everlasting song  That in the ears of all men rings,--  That unrelieved, our whole life long,  Each hour, in passing, hoarsely sings.  In very terror I at morn awake,  Upon the verge of bitter weeping,  To see the day of disappointment break,  To no one hope of mine--not one--its promise keeping:--  That even each joy's presentiment  With wilful cavil would diminish,  With grinning masks of life prevent  My mind its fairest work to finish!  Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously  Upon my couch of sleep I lay me:  There, also, comes no rest to me,  But some wild dream is sent to fray me.  The God that in my breast is owned  Can deeply stir the inner sources;  The God, above my powers enthroned,  He cannot change external forces.  So, by the burden of my days oppressed,  Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest!    MEPHISTOPHELES    And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest.    FAUST    O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances,  The bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth!  Whom, after rapid, maddening dances,  In clasping maiden-arms he findeth!  O would that I, before that spirit-power,  Ravished and rapt from life, had sunken!    MEPHISTOPHELES    And yet, by some one, in that nightly hour,  A certain liquid was not drunken.    FAUST    Eavesdropping, ha! thy pleasure seems to be.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me.    FAUST    Though some familiar tone, retrieving  My thoughts from torment, led me on,  And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving  A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn,  Yet now I curse whate'er entices  And snares the soul with visions vain;  With dazzling cheats and dear devices  Confines it in this cave of pain!  Cursed be, at once, the high ambition  Wherewith the mind itself deludes!  Cursed be the glare of apparition  That on the finer sense intrudes!  Cursed be the lying dream's impression  Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow!  Cursed, all that flatters as possession,  As wife and child, as knave and plow!  Cursed Mammon be, when he with treasures  To restless action spurs our fate!  Cursed when, for soft, indulgent leisures,  He lays for us the pillows straight!  Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar,--  The highest favor Love lets fall!  Cursed, also, Hope!--cursed Faith, the spectre!  And cursed be Patience most of all!    CHORUS OF SPIRITS (_invisible_)         Woe! woe!       Thou hast it destroyed,       The beautiful world,       With powerful fist:       In ruin 'tis hurled,       By the blow of a demigod shattered!       The scattered       Fragments into the Void we carry,       Deploring       The beauty perished beyond restoring.       Mightier       For the children of men,       Brightlier       Build it again,       In thine own bosom build it anew!       Bid the new career       Commence,       With clearer sense,       And the new songs of cheer       Be sung thereto!    MEPHISTOPHELES    These are the small dependants  Who give me attendance.  Hear them, to deeds and passion  Counsel in shrewd old-fashion!  Into the world of strife,  Out of this lonely life  That of senses and sap has betrayed thee,  They would persuade thee.  This nursing of the pain forego thee,  That, like a vulture, feeds upon thy breast!  The worst society thou find'st will show thee  Thou art a man among the rest.  But 'tis not meant to thrust  Thee into the mob thou hatest!  I am not one of the greatest,  Yet, wilt thou to me entrust  Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,--  Will willingly walk beside thee,--  Will serve thee at once and forever  With best endeavor,  And, if thou art satisfied,  Will as servant, slave, with thee abide.    FAUST    And what shall be my counter-service therefor?    MEPHISTOPHELES    The time is long: thou need'st not now insist.    FAUST    No--no! The Devil is an egotist,  And is not apt, without a why or wherefore,  \"For God's sake,\" others to assist.  Speak thy conditions plain and clear!  With such a servant danger comes, I fear.    MEPHISTOPHELES    _Here_, an unwearied slave, I'll wear thy tether,  And to thine every nod obedient be:  When _There_ again we come together,  Then shalt thou do the same for me.    FAUST    The _There_ my scruples naught increases.  When thou hast dashed this world to pieces,  The other, then, its place may fill.  Here, on this earth, my pleasures have their sources;  Yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses;  And when from these my life itself divorces,  Let happen all that can or will!  I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder  If there we cherish love or hate,  Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder,  A High and Low our souls await.

Ermengarde delighted in the  story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening.  Lavinia was very spiteful about it, and told Jessie that she didn't  believe such things as diamond mines existed.    \"My mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds,\" she said.  \"And  it is not a big one, either.  If there were mines full of diamonds,  people would be so rich it would be ridiculous.\"    \"Perhaps Sara will be so rich that she will be ridiculous,\" giggled  Jessie.    \"She's ridiculous without being rich,\" Lavinia sniffed.    \"I believe you hate her,\" said Jessie.    \"No, I don't,\" snapped Lavinia.  \"But I don't believe in mines full of  diamonds.\"    \"Well, people have to get them from somewhere,\" said Jessie.  \"Lavinia,\" with a new giggle, \"what do you think Gertrude says?\"    \"I don't know, I'm sure; and I don't care if it's something more about  that everlasting Sara.\"    \"Well, it is.  One of her 'pretends' is that she is a princess.  She  plays it all the time--even in school.  She says it makes her learn her  lessons better.  She wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde  says she is too fat.\"    \"She IS too fat,\" said Lavinia.  \"And Sara is too thin.\"    Naturally, Jessie giggled again.    \"She says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what you  have.  It has only to do with what you THINK of, and what you DO.\"    \"I suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar,\"  said Lavinia.  \"Let us begin to call her Your Royal Highness.\"    Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the  schoolroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best.  It was the time  when Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia were taking their tea in the sitting  room sacred to themselves.  At this hour a great deal of talking was  done, and a great many secrets changed hands, particularly if the  younger pupils behaved themselves well, and did not squabble or run  about noisily, which it must be confessed they usually did.  When they  made an uproar the older girls usually interfered with scolding and  shakes.  They were expected to keep order, and there was danger that if  they did not, Miss Minchin or Miss Amelia would appear and put an end  to festivities. Even as Lavinia spoke the door opened and Sara entered  with Lottie, whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little  dog.    \"There she is, with that horrid child!\" exclaimed Lavinia in a whisper.  \"If she's so fond of her, why doesn't she keep her in her own room? She  will begin howling about something in five minutes.\"    It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in  the schoolroom, and had begged her adopted parent to come with her. She  joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner. Sara curled  herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to read.  It  was a book about the French Revolution, and she was soon lost in a  harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille--men who had spent  so many years in dungeons that when they were dragged out by those who  rescued them, their long, gray hair and beards almost hid their faces,  and they had forgotten that an outside world existed at all, and were  like beings in a dream.    She was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable to be  dragged back suddenly by a howl from Lottie.  Never did she find  anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when  she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are  fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at  such a moment.  The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one  not easy to manage.    \"It makes me feel as if someone had hit me,\" Sara had told Ermengarde  once in confidence.  \"And as if I want to hit back.  I have to remember  things quickly to keep from saying something ill-tempered.\"    She had to remember things quickly when she laid her book on the  window-seat and jumped down from her comfortable corner.    Lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor, and, having first  irritated Lavinia and Jessie by making a noise, had ended by falling  down and hurting her fat knee.  She was screaming and dancing up and  down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies, who were  alternately coaxing and scolding her.    \"Stop this minute, you cry-baby!  Stop this minute!\"  Lavinia commanded.    \"I'm not a cry-baby ... I'm not!\" wailed Lottie.  \"Sara, Sa--ra!\"    \"If she doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her,\" cried Jessie.  \"Lottie darling, I'll give you a penny!\"    \"I don't want your penny,\" sobbed Lottie; and she looked down at the  fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it, burst forth again.    Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her arms round her.    \"Now, Lottie,\" she said.  \"Now, Lottie, you PROMISED Sara.\"    \"She said I was a cry-baby,\" wept Lottie.    Sara patted her, but spoke in the steady voice Lottie knew.    \"But if you cry, you will be one, Lottie pet.  You PROMISED.\" Lottie  remembered that she had promised, but she preferred to lift up her  voice.    \"I haven't any mamma,\" she proclaimed.  \"I haven't--a bit--of mamma.\"    \"Yes, you have,\" said Sara, cheerfully.  \"Have you forgotten?  Don't  you know that Sara is your mamma?  Don't you want Sara for your mamma?\"    Lottie cuddled up to her with a consoled sniff.    \"Come and sit in the window-seat with me,\" Sara went on, \"and I'll  whisper a story to you.\"    \"Will you?\" whimpered Lottie.  \"Will you--tell me--about the diamond  mines?\"    \"The diamond mines?\" broke out Lavinia.  \"Nasty, little spoiled thing,  I should like to SLAP her!\"    Sara got up quickly on her feet.  It must be remembered that she had  been very deeply absorbed in the book about the Bastille, and she had  had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must go  and take care of her adopted child.  She was not an angel, and she was  not fond of Lavinia.    \"Well,\" she said, with some fire, \"I should like to slap YOU--but I  don't want to slap you!\" restraining herself.  \"At least I both want to  slap you--and I should LIKE to slap you--but I WON'T slap you.  We are  not little gutter children.  We are both old enough to know better.\"    Here was Lavinia's opportunity.    \"Ah, yes, your royal highness,\" she said.  \"We are princesses, I  believe.  At least one of us is.  The school ought to be very  fashionable now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil.\"    Sara started toward her.  She looked as if she were going to box her  ears.  Perhaps she was.  Her trick of pretending things was the joy of  her life.  She never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of. Her new  \"pretend\" about being a princess was very near to her heart, and she  was shy and sensitive about it.  She had meant it to be rather a  secret, and here was Lavinia deriding it before nearly all the school.  She felt the blood rush up into her face and tingle in her ears. She  only just saved herself.  If you were a princess, you did not fly into  rages.  Her hand dropped, and she stood quite still a moment. When she  spoke it was in a quiet, steady voice; she held her head up, and  everybody listened to her.    \"It's true,\" she said.  \"Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess.  I  pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one.\"    Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say.  Several  times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply  when she was dealing with Sara.  The reason for this was that, somehow,  the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent. She  saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly. The truth  was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear  something more definite about this one, and drew nearer Sara  accordingly.    Lavinia could only invent one remark, and it fell rather flat.    \"Dear me,\" she said, \"I hope, when you ascend the throne, you won't  forget us!\"    \"I won't,\" said Sara, and she did not utter another word, but stood  quite still, and stared at her steadily as she saw her take Jessie's  arm and turn away.    After this, the girls who were jealous of her used to speak of her as  \"Princess Sara\" whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful, and  those who were fond of her gave her the name among themselves as a term  of affection.  No one called her \"princess\" instead of \"Sara,\" but her  adorers were much pleased with the picturesqueness and grandeur of the  title, and Miss Minchin, hearing of it, mentioned it more than once to  visiting parents, feeling that it rather suggested a sort of royal  boarding school.    To Becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world. The  acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she had jumped up  terrified from her sleep in the comfortable chair, had ripened and  grown, though it must be confessed that Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia  knew very little about it.  They were aware that Sara was \"kind\" to the  scullery maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments  snatched perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with  lightning rapidity, Sara's sitting room was reached, and the heavy coal  box set down with a sigh of joy. At such times stories were told by  installments, things of a satisfying nature were either produced and  eaten or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night, when  Becky went upstairs to her attic to bed.    \"But I has to eat 'em careful, miss,\" she said once; \"'cos if I leaves  crumbs the rats come out to get 'em.\"    \"Rats!\" exclaimed Sara, in horror.  \"Are there RATS there?\"    \"Lots of 'em, miss,\" Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact manner.  \"There mostly is rats an' mice in attics.  You gets used to the noise  they makes scuttling about.  I've got so I don't mind 'em s' long as  they don'"]]]
