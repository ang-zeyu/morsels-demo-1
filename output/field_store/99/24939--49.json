In the _Journal_ of George Fox  (1672) we come across this statement: \"We had a Mens-Meeting and a  Womens-Meeting.... On the First of these Days the Men and Women had  their Meetings for Business, wherein the Affairs of the Church of God  were taken care of.\" Moreover, what must have seemed an abomination to  the Puritan Fathers, these Quakers allowed their wives and mothers to  serve in official capacities in the church, and permitted them to take  part in the quarterly business sessions. Thus, John Woolman in his  _Diary_ says: \"We attended the Quarterly meeting with Ann Gaunt and  Mercy Redman.\" \"After the quarterly meeting of worship ended I felt  drawings to go to the Women's meeting of business which was very  full.\" What was especially shocking to their Puritan neighbors was the  fact that these Quakers allowed their women to go forth as missionary  speakers, and, as in the case of Mary Dyer, to invade the sacred  precincts of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to proselyte to Quakerism.      _VII. Female Rebellion_    But those Puritan colonists had far greater troubles to harass them than  the few quiet Quaker women who were moved by Inner Light to speak in the  village streets. One of these troubles we have touched upon--the Rise of  the Antinomians, or the disturbance caused by Anne Hutchinson. The other  was the Salem Witchcraft proceedings. In both of these women were  directly concerned, and indeed were at the root of the disturbances. Let  us examine in some detail the influence of Puritan womanhood in these  social upheavals that shook the foundations of church rule in New  England.    While most of the women of the Puritan colonies seem to have been too  busy with their household duties and their numerous children to concern  themselves extensively with public affairs, there was this one woman,  Anne Hutchinson, who has gained lasting fame as the cause of the  greatest religious and political disturbance occurring in Massachusetts  before the days of the Revolution. Many are the references in the early  writers to this radical leader and her followers. Some of the most  prominent men and women in the colony were inclined to follow her, and  for a time it appeared that hers was to be the real power of the day;  great was the excitement. Thomas Hutchinson in his _History of  Massachusetts Bay Colony_, told of her trial and banishment:  \"Countenanced and encouraged by Mr. Vane and Mr. Cotton, she advanced  doctrines and opinions which involved the colony in disputes and  contensions; and being improved to civil as well as religious purposes,  had like to have produced ruin both to church and state.\"    Anne Hutchinson was the daughter of Francis Marbury, a prominent  clergyman of Lincolnshire, England. Intensely religious as a child, she  was deeply influenced when a young woman by the preaching of John  Cotton. The latter, not being able to worship as he wished in England,  moved to the Puritan colony in the New World, and Anne Hutchinson, upon  her arrival at Boston, frankly confessed that she had crossed the sea  solely to be under his preaching in his new home.    Many of the prominent men of the community soon became her followers:  Sir Harry Vane, Governor of the colony; her brother-in-law, the Rev.  John Wheelwright; William Coddington, a magistrate of Boston; and even  Cotton himself, leader of the church and supposedly orthodox of the  orthodox. That this was enough to turn the head of any woman may well be  surmised, especially when we remember that she was presumed to be the  silent and weaker vessel,--to find suddenly learned men and even the  greatest clergymen of the community sitting at her feet and hearing her  doctrines. It is difficult to determine the real state of affairs  concerning this woman and her teachings. Nothing unless, possibly the  witchcraft delusion at Salem, excited the colony as did this  disturbance in both church and state. While much has been written, so  much of partisanship is displayed in all the statements that it is with  great difficulty that we are able really to separate the facts from  jealousy and bitterness. During the first few months of her stay she  seems to have been commended for her faithful attendance at church, her  care of the sick, and her benevolent attitude toward the community. Even  her meetings for the sisters were praised by the pastors. But, not  content with holding meetings for her neighbors, she criticised the  preachers and their teachings. This was especially irritating to the  good Elders, because woman was supposed to be the silent member in the  household and meeting-house, and not capable of offering worthy  criticism. But even then the matter might have been passed in silence if  the church and state had not been one, and the pastors politicians.  Hutchinson, a kinsman of the rebellious leader, says in his _History of  Massachusetts Bay_:    \"It is highly probable that if Mr. Vane had remained in England, or had  not craftily made use of the party which maintained these peculiar  opinions in religion, to bring him into civil power and authority and  draw the affections of the people from those who were their leaders into  the wilderness, these, like many other errors, might have prevailed a  short time without any disturbance to the state, and as the absurdity of  them appeared, silently subsided, and posterity would not have known that  such a woman as Mrs. Hutchinson ever existed.... It is difficult to  discover, from Mr. Cotton's own account of his principles published ten  years afterwards, in his answer to Bailey, wherein he differed from  her.... He seems to have been in danger when she was upon trial. The ...  ministers treated him coldly, but Mr. Winthrop, whose influence was now  greater than ever, protected him.\"    Just what were Anne Hutchinson's doctrines no one has ever been able to  determine; even Winthrop, a very able, clear-headed man who was well  versed in Puritan theology, and who was one of her most powerful  opponents, said he was unable to define them. \"The two capital errors  with which she was charged were these: That the Holy Ghost dwells  personally in a justified person; and that nothing of sanctification can  help to evidence to believers their justification.\"[16]    Her teachings were not unlike those of the Quietists and that of the  \"Inner Light,\" set forth by the Quakers--a doctrine that has always held  a charm for people who enjoy the mystical. But it was not so much the  doctrines probably as the fact that she and her followers were a  disturbing element that caused her expulsion from a colony where it was  vital and necessary to the existence of the settlement that harmony  should prevail. There had been great hardships and sacrifices; even yet  the colony was merely a handful of people surrounded by thousands of  active enemies. If these colonists were to live there must be uniformity  and conformity. \"When the Pequots threatened Massachusetts colony a few  men in Boston refused to serve. These were Antinomians, followers of  Anne Hutchinson, who suspected their chaplain of being under a 'Covenant  of works,' whereas their doctrine was one should live under a 'Covenant  of grace.' This is one of the great reasons why they were banished. It  was the very life of the colony that they should have conformity, and  all of them as one man could scarcely withstand the Indians. Therefore  this religious doctrine was working rebellion and sedition, and  endangering the very existence of the state.\"[17]    Mistress Hutchinson was given a church trial, and after long days of  discussion was banished. Her sentence as recorded stands as follows:  \"Mrs. Hutchinson, the wife of Mr. William Hutchinson, being convented  for traducing the ministers and their ministry in the country, she  declared voluntarily her revelation, and that she should be delivered,  and the court ruined with her posterity, and thereupon was  banished.\"[18] The facts prove that she must have been a woman of  shrewdness, force, personality, intelligence, and endowed with the  ability to lead. At her trial she was certainly the equal of the  ministers in her sharp and puzzling replies. The theological discussion  was exciting and many were the fine-spun, hair-splitting doctrines  brought forward on either side; but to-day the mere reading of them is a  weariness to the flesh.    Anne Hutchinson's efforts, according to some viewpoints, may have been a  failure, but they revealed in unmistakable manner the emotional  starvation of Puritan womanhood. Women, saddened by their hardships,  depressed by their religion, denied an open love for beauty, with none  of the usual food for imagination or the common outlets for emotions,  such as the modern woman has in her magazines, books, theatre and social  functions, flocked with eagerness to hear this feminine radical. They  seemed to realize that their souls were starving for something--they may  not have known exactly what. At first they may have gone to the  assemblies simply because such an unusual occurrence offered at least a  change or a diversion; but a very little listening seems to have  convinced them that this woman understood the female heart far better  than did John Cotton or any other male pastor of the settlements.  Moreover, the theory of \"inner light\" or the \"covenant of grace\"  undoubtedly appealed as something novel and refreshing after the  prolonged soul fast under the harshness and intolerance of the  Calvinistic creed. The women told their women friends of the new  theories, and wives and mothers talked of the matter to husbands and  fathers until gradually a great number of men became interested. The  churches of Massachusetts Bay Colony were in imminent danger of losing  their grasp upon the people and the government.

The situation resulting in this phantasy is,  however, nothing but a new edition of one that actually took place.    2. A dream apparently meaningless relates to figures. _\"She wants to pay  something; her daughter takes three florins sixty-five kreuzers out of  her purse; but she says: 'What are you doing? It only cost twenty-one  kreuzers.'\"_    The dreamer was a stranger who had placed her child at school in Vienna,  and who was able to continue under my treatment so long as her daughter  remained at Vienna. The day before the dream the directress of the  school had recommended her to keep the child another year at school. In  this case she would have been able to prolong her treatment by one year.  The figures in the dream become important if it be remembered that time  is money. One year equals 365 days, or, expressed in kreuzers, 365  kreuzers, which is three florins sixty-five kreuzers. The twenty-one  kreuzers correspond with the three weeks which remained from the day of  the dream to the end of the school term, and thus to the end of the  treatment. It was obviously financial considerations which had moved the  lady to refuse the proposal of the directress, and which were answerable  for the triviality of the amount in the dream.    3. A lady, young, but already ten years married, heard that a friend of  hers, Miss Elise L----, of about the same age, had become engaged. This  gave rise to the following dream:    _She was sitting with her husband in the theater; the one side of the  stalls was quite empty. Her husband tells her, Elise L---- and her  fiance had intended coming, but could only get some cheap seats, three  for one florin fifty kreuzers, and these they would not take. In her  opinion, that would not have mattered very much._    The origin of the figures from the matter of the dream thoughts and the  changes the figures underwent are of interest. Whence came the one  florin fifty kreuzers? From a trifling occurrence of the previous day.  Her sister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her  husband, and had quickly got rid of it by buying some ornament. Note  that 150 florins is one hundred times one florin fifty kreuzers. For the  _three_ concerned with the tickets, the only link is that Elise L---- is  exactly three months younger than the dreamer. The scene in the dream is  the repetition of a little adventure for which she has often been teased  by her husband. She was once in a great hurry to get tickets in time for  a piece, and when she came to the theater _one side of the stalls was  almost empty_. It was therefore quite unnecessary for her to have been  in _such a hurry_. Nor must we overlook the absurdity of the dream that  two persons should take three tickets for the theater.    Now for the dream ideas. It was _stupid_ to have married so early; I  _need not_ have been _in so great a hurry_. Elise L----'s example shows  me that I should have been able to get a husband later; indeed, one a  _hundred times better_ if I had but waited. I could have bought _three_  such men with the money (dowry).

A dream is as a rule untranslatable into other  languages.\"--TRANSLATOR.

Abel's essay, \"Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworter\"  (1884, the following examples of such words in England are given:  \"gleam--gloom\"; \"to lock--loch\"; \"down--The Downs\"; \"to step--to stop.\"  In his essay on \"The Origin of Language\" (\"Linguistic Essays,\" p. 240),  Abel says: \"When the Englishman says 'without,' is not his judgment  based upon the comparative juxtaposition of two opposites, 'with' and  'out'; 'with' itself originally meant 'without,' as may still be seen in  'withdraw.' 'Bid' includes the opposite sense of giving and of  proffering.\" Abel, \"The English Verbs of Command,\" \"Linguistic Essays,\"  p. 104; see also Freud, \"Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworte\"; _Jahrbuch fuer  Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen_, Band II., part  i., p. 179).--TRANSLATOR.          III    WHY THE DREAM DISGUISES THE DESIRES      In the foregoing exposition we have now learnt something of the dream  work; we must regard it as a quite special psychical process, which, so  far as we are aware, resembles nothing else. To the dream work has been  transferred that bewilderment which its product, the dream, has aroused  in us. In truth, the dream work is only the first recognition of a group  of psychical processes to which must be referred the origin of  hysterical symptoms, the ideas of morbid dread, obsession, and illusion.  Condensation, and especially displacement, are never-failing features in  these other processes. The regard for appearance remains, on the other  hand, peculiar to the dream work. If this explanation brings the dream  into line with the formation of psychical disease, it becomes the more  important to fathom the essential conditions of processes like dream  building. It will be probably a surprise to hear that neither the state  of sleep nor illness is among the indispensable conditions. A whole  number of phenomena of the everyday life of healthy persons,  forgetfulness, slips in speaking and in holding things, together with a  certain class of mistakes, are due to a psychical mechanism analogous to  that of the dream and the other members of this group.    Displacement is the core of the problem, and the most striking of all  the dream performances. A thorough investigation of the subject shows  that the essential condition of displacement is purely psychological; it  is in the nature of a motive. We get on the track by thrashing out  experiences which one cannot avoid in the analysis of dreams. I had to  break off the relations of my dream thoughts in the analysis of my dream  on p. 8 because I found some experiences which I do not wish strangers  to know, and which I could not relate without serious damage to  important considerations. I added, it would be no use were I to select  another instead of that particular dream; in every dream where the  content is obscure or intricate, I should hit upon dream thoughts which  call for secrecy. If, however, I continue the analysis for myself,  without regard to those others, for whom, indeed, so personal an event  as my dream cannot matter, I arrive finally at ideas which surprise me,  which I have not known to be mine, which not only appear _foreign_ to  me, but which are _unpleasant_, and which I would like to oppose  vehemently, whilst the chain of ideas running through the analysis  intrudes upon me inexorably. I can only take these circumstances into  account by admitting that these thoughts are actually part of my  psychical life, possessing a certain psychical intensity or energy.  However, by virtue of a particular psychological condition, the  _thoughts could not become conscious to me_. I call this particular  condition \"_Repression_.\" It is therefore impossible for me not to  recognize some casual relationship between the obscurity of the dream  content and this state of repression--this _incapacity of  consciousness_. Whence I conclude that the cause of the obscurity is  _the desire to conceal these thoughts_. Thus I arrive at the conception  of the _dream distortion_ as the deed of the dream work, and of  _displacement_ serving to disguise this object.    I will test this in my own dream, and ask myself, What is the thought  which, quite innocuous in its distorted form, provokes my liveliest  opposition in its real form? I remember that the free drive reminded me  of the last expensive drive with a member of my family, the  interpretation of the dream being: I should for once like to experience  affection for which I should not have to pay, and that shortly before  the dream I had to make a heavy disbursement for this very person. In  this connection, I cannot get away from the thought _that I regret this  disbursement_. It is only when I acknowledge this feeling that there is  any sense in my wishing in the dream for an affection that should entail  no outlay. And yet I can state on my honor that I did not hesitate for a  moment when it became necessary to expend that sum. The regret, the  counter-current, was unconscious to me. Why it was unconscious is quite  another question which would lead us far away from the answer which,  though within my knowledge, belongs elsewhere.    If I subject the dream of another person instead of one of my own to  analysis, the result is the same; the motives for convincing others is,  however, changed. In the dream of a healthy person the only way for me  to enable him to accept this repressed idea is the coherence of the  dream thoughts. He is at liberty to reject this explanation. But if we  are dealing with a person suffering from any neurosis--say from  hysteria--the recognition of these repressed ideas is compulsory by  reason of their connection with the symptoms of his illness and of the  improvement resulting from exchanging the symptoms for the repressed  ideas. Take the patient from whom I got the last dream about the three  tickets for one florin fifty kreuzers. Analysis shows that she does not  think highly of her husband, that she regrets having married him, that  she would be glad to change him for some one else. "]]]
