THE FOURTH BOOK OF WORDSWORTH'S UNPUBLISHED POEM.[3]        Bright was the summer's noon when quickening steps    Followed each other till a dreary moor    Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top    Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,    I overlooked the bed of Windermere,    Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.    With exultation at my feet I saw    Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,    A universe of Nature's fairest forms    Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,    Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.    I bounded down the hill shouting amain    For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks    Replied, and when the Charon of the flood    Had stayed his oars, and touched the jutting pier,    I did not step into the well-known boat    Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed    Up the familiar hill I took my way    Toward that sweet Valley where I had been reared;    'Twas but a shore hour's walk, ere veering round    I saw the snow-white church upon her hill    Sit like a throned Lady, sending out    A gracious look all over her domain.    You azure smoke betrays the lurking town;    With eager footsteps I advance and reach    The cottage threshold where my journey closed.    Glad welcome had I, with some tear, perhaps,    From my old Dame, so kind and motherly,    While she perused me with a parent's pride.    The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew    Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart    Can beat never will I forget they name.    Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest    After thy innocent and busy stir    In narrow cares, thy little daily growth    Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,    And more than eighty, of untroubled life,    Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood    Honored with little less than filial love.    What joy was mine to see thee once again,    Thee and they dwelling, and a crowd of things    About its narrow precincts all beloved,    And many of them seeming yet my own!    Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts    Have felt, and every man alive can guess?    The rooms, the court, the garden were not left    Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat    Round the stone table under the dark pine,    Friendly to studious or to festive hours;    Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,    The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed    Within our garden, found himself at once,    As if by trick insidious and unkind,    Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down    (Without an effort and without a will)    A channel paved by man's officious care.    I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,    And in the press of twenty thousand thought,    \"Ha,\" quoth I, \"pretty prisoner, are you there!\"    Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,    \"An emblem here behold of they own life;    In its late course of even days with all    Their smooth enthralment;\" but the heart was full,    Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame    Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;    I willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.    --The face of every neighbor whom I met    Was like a volume to me; some were hailed    Upon the road, some busy at their work,    Unceremonious greetings interchanged    With half the length of a long field between.    Among my schoolfellows I scattered round    Like recognitions, but with some constraint    Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,    But with more shame, for my habiliments,    The transformation wrought by gay attire.    Not less delighted did I take my place    At our domestic table: and, dear Friend!    In this endeavor simply to relate    A Poet's history, may I leave untold    The thankfulness with which I laid me down    In my accustomed bed, more welcome now    Perhaps than if it had been more desired    Or been more often thought of with regret;    That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind    Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft    Had lain awake on summer nights to watch    The moon in splendor couched among the leaves    Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood;    Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro    In the dark summit of the waving tree    She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.      Among the favorites whom it pleased me well    To see again, was one by ancient right    Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;    By birth and call of nature pre-ordained    To hunt the badger and unearth the fox    Among the impervious crags, but having been    From youth our own adopted, he had passed    Into a gentler service. And when first    The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day    Along my veins I kindled with the stir,    The fermentation, and the vernal heat    Of poesy, affecting private shades    Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used    To watch me, an attendant and a friend,    Obsequious to my steps early and late,    Though often of such dilatory walk    Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.    A hundred times when, roving high and low,    I have been harassed with the toil of verse,    Much pains and little progress, and at once    Some lovely Image in the song rose up    Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;    Then have I darted forward to let loose    My hand upon his back with stormy joy,    Caressing him again and yet again.    And when at evening on the public way    I sauntered, like a river murmuring    And talking to itself when all things else    Are still, the creature trotted on before;    Such was his custom; but whene'er he met    A passenger approaching, he would turn    To give me timely notice, and straightway,    Grateful for that admonishment, I hushed    My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air    And mein of one whose thoughts are free, advanced    To give and take a greeting that might save    My name from piteous rumors, such as wait    On men suspected to be crazed in brain.      Those walks well worth to be prized and loved--    Regretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,    But they were richly laden with all good,    And cannot be remembered but with thanks    And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart--    Those walks in all their freshness now came back    Like a returning Spring. When first I made    Once more the circuit of our little lake,    If ever happiness hath lodged with man,    That day consummate happiness was mine,    Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.    The sun was set, or setting, when I left    Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on    A sober hour, not winning or serene,    For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;    But as a face we love is sweetest then    When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look    It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart    Have fullness in herself; even so with me    It fared that evening. Gently did my soul    Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood    Naked, as in the presence of her God.    While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch    A heart that had not been disconsolate:    Strength came where weakness was not known to be,    At least not felt; and restoration came    Like an intruder knocking at the door    Of unacknowledged weariness. I took    The balance, and with firm hand weighted myself.    --Of that external scene which round me lay,    Little, in this abstraction, did I see;    Remembered less; but I had inward hopes    And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,    Conversed with promises, had glimmering views    How life pervades the undecaying mind;    How the immortal soul with God-like power    Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep    That time can lay upon her; how on earth,    Man, if he do but live within the light    Of high endeavors, daily spreads abroad    His being armed with strength that cannot fail    Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love    Of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13722"],[0,"Youth and Sex: Dangers and Safeguards for Girls and Boys (#9)"],[1,"this system has been based are  unreasonable and incapable of proof.    Since conclusive evidence of the prevalence of impurity among boys is  available, I will not at present invite the reader to examine the  assumptions which lead most people to a contrary belief. When I do  so, I shall hope to demonstrate that we might reasonably expect to  find things precisely as they are. In the first and second chapters we  shall see to what conclusions teachers who have actual experience in  the matter have been led.    There are several teachers whose authority in most matters stands so  very much above my own that it might seem presumptuous to begin by  laying my own experiences before the reader; but I venture to take  this course because no other teacher, as far as I know, has published  quite such definite evidence as I have done; and I think that the more  general statements of such eminent men as Canon Lyttelton, Mr. A.C.  Benson, and Dr. Clement Dukes will appeal to the reader more  powerfully when he has some idea of the manner in which conclusions on  this subject may be reached. I have some reason, also, for the belief  that the paper I read in 1908 at the London University before the  International Congress on Moral Education has been considered of great  significance by very competent judges. By a special decision of the  Executive of the Congress it--alone of all sectional papers--was  printed _in extenso_ in the official report. Later on, it came under  the notice of Sir R. Baden-Powell, at whose request it was republished  in the _Headquarters Gazette_--the official organ of the Boy Scout  movement.    It certainly did require some courage at the time to put my results  before the public, for I was not then aware that men of great eminence  in the educational world had already made equally sweeping, if less  definite, statements. Emboldened by this fact and by the commendations  above referred to, I venture to quote the greater part of this short  paper.    \"The opinions I am about to put forward are based almost entirely on  my own twenty years' experience as a housemaster. My house contains  forty-eight boys, who vary in age from ten to nineteen and come from  comfortable middle-class homes.    \"Private interviews with individual boys in my study have been the  chief vehicle of my teaching and the chief source of my information.  My objects in these interviews have been to warn boys against the  evils of private impurity, to supply them with a certain amount of  knowledge on sexual subjects in order to prevent a prurient curiosity,  and to induce them to confide to me the history of their own knowledge  and difficulties. In my early days I interviewed those only who  appeared to me to be obviously suffering from the effects of impurity,  and, of late years, the extreme pressure of my work has forced me very  reluctantly to recur to this plan.    \"For several years, however, I was accustomed to interview every boy  under my care during his first term with me. Very rarely have I failed  in these interviews so to secure a boy's confidence as to learn the  salient facts of the history of his inner life. Sunday afternoon  addresses to the Sixth Form on the sexual dangers of late youth and  early manhood have resulted at times in elder boys themselves seeking  an interview with me. Such spontaneous confidences have naturally  been fuller, and therefore more instructive, than the confidences I  have invited.    \"Many people are inclined to look upon the instruction of boys in  relation to adolescence as needless and harmful; needless because few  boys, they imagine, awake to the consciousness and problems of sex  until manhood; harmful because the pristine innocence of the mind is,  they think, destroyed, and evils are suggested of which a boy might  otherwise remain unconscious. To one who knows what boys really are  such ideas are nothing less than ludicrous.    \"Boys come to our school from many different classes of preparatory  and secondary schools. Almost every such school seems to possess a few  boys who delight to initiate younger boys into sexual knowledge, and  usually into knowledge of solitary vice. The very few boys who have  come to me quite ignorant of these matters have come either straight  from home at ten or eleven, or from a school in which a few young boys  are educated with girls. Of boys who have come under my care as late  as twelve I have known but two who even professed total ignorance on  sexual subjects, and in one of these cases I am quite sure that no  such ignorance existed.    \"In a large majority of cases solitary vice has been learned and  practised before a boy has got into his teens. The lack of insight  parents display in relation to these questions is quite phenomenal.  The few who mention the subject to me are always quite satisfied of  the complete 'innocence' of their boys. Some of the most precocious  and unclean boys I have known have been thus confidently commended to  me. Boys are wholly unsuspicious of the extent to which their inner  life lies open to the practised eye, and they feel secure that nothing  can betray their secrets if they themselves do not.    \"In no department of our life are George Eliot's words truer than in  this department: 'Our daily familiar life is but a hiding of ourselves  from each other behind a screen of trivial words and deeds, and those  who sit with us at the same hearth are often the farthest off from the  deep human soul within us--full of unspoken evil and unacted good.' We  cannot prevent a boy's obtaining information on sexual questions. Our  choice lies between leaving him to pick it up from unclean and vulgar  minds, which will make it guilty and impure, and giving it ourselves  in such a way as to invest it from the first with a sacred character.    \"Another idea which my experience proves to be an entire delusion is  the idea that a boy's natural refinement is a sufficient protection  against defilement. Some of the most refined boys I have had the  pleasure of caring for have been pronounced victims of solitary sin.  That it is a sin at all, that it has, indeed, any significance, either  ethical or spiritual, has not so much as occurred to most of them. On  what great moral question dare we leave the young to find their own  way absolutely without guidance? In this most difficult and dangerous  of all questions we leave the young soul, stirred by novel and blind  impulses, to grope in the darkness. Is it any wonder if it fails to  see things in their true relations?    \"Again, it is sometimes thought that the consequences of secret sin  are so patent as to deter a boy from the sin itself. So far is this  from being the case that I have never yet found a single boy (even  among those who have, through it, made almost complete wrecks  physically and mentally) who has of himself connected these  consequences with the sin itself. I have, on the other hand, known  many sad cases in which, through the weakening of will power, which  this habit causes, boys of high ideals have fallen again and again  after their eyes have been fully opened. This sin is rarely a  conscious moral transgression. The boy is a victim to be sympathised  with and helped, not an offender to be reproved and punished.\"    I desire to call the attention of the reader to two points in the  foregoing extract. I was particular in giving my credentials to state  the character and limitations of my experience. Everywhere in life one  finds confident and sweeping generalisations made by men who have  little or no experience to appeal to. This is specially the case in  the educational world, and perhaps most of all in discussions on this  very subject. Some men, at least, are willing to instruct the public  with nothing better to guide them than the light of Nature. It would  greatly assist the quest of truth if everyone who ventures to address  the public on this question would first present his credentials.    There is danger lest the reader should discount the significance of  the statements I make in the foregoing paper by falling into the error  of supposing that the facts stated apply, after all, to one school  only. This is not by any means so. The facts have been collected _at_  one school; but those which refer to the prevalence of sex knowledge  and of masturbation have reference solely to the condition of boys  when they first entered, and are significant of the conditions which  obtain at some scores of schools and in many homes. I venture here to  quote and to warmly endorse Canon Lyttelton's opinion: \"It is,  however, so easy to be misunderstood in this matter that I must insert  a caution against an inference which may be drawn from these words,  viz. that school life is the _origin_ of immorality among boys. The  real origin is to be found in the common predisposition to vicious  conceptions, which is the result of neglect. Nature provides in almost  every case an active curiosity on this subject; and that curiosity  must be somehow allayed; and if it were not allayed at school, false  and depraved ideas would be picked up at home.... So readily does an  ignorant mind at an early age take in teaching about these subjects  that there are no conceivable conditions of modern social life not  fraught with grave peril to a young boy, if once he has been allowed  to face them quite unprepared, either by instruction or by warning.  And this manifestly applies to life at home, or in a day-school, or  in a boarding-school to an almost equal degree.\"[A]    [Footnote A: _Training of the Young in Relation to Sex, p. 1 et  seq_.]    One of the facts which I always tried to elicit from boys was the  source of their information, or rather the character of that source,  for I was naturally anxious not to ask a boy to incriminate any  individual known to me. In many cases, information came first to the  boy at _home_ from a brother, or cousin, or casual"]]]
