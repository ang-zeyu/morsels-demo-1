And all  these motions are performed with strength and velocity in proportion to the  energy of the sensation that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial  power.    2. Many of the motions of our organs of sense, or ideas, that were  originally excited into action by irritation, become in like manner more  frequently causable by our sensations of pleasure or pain. These motions  are then termed the ideas of imagination, and make up all the scenery and  transactions of our dreams. Thus when any painful or pleasurable sensations  possess us, as of love, anger, fear; whether in our sleep or waking hours,  the ideas, that have been formerly excited by the objects of these  sensations, now vividly recur before us by their connection with these  sensations themselves. So the fair smiling virgin, that excited your love  by her presence, whenever that sensation recurs, rises before you in  imagination; and that with all the pleasing circumstances, that had before  engaged your attention. And in sleep, when you dream under the influence of  fear, all the robbers, fires, and precipices, that you formerly have seen  or heard of, arise before you with terrible vivacity. All these sensual  motions, like the muscular ones above mentioned, are performed with  strength and velocity in proportion to the energy of the sensation of  pleasure or pain, which excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power.    II. 1. Many of these muscular motions above described, that are most  frequently excited by our sensations, are nevertheless occasionally  causable by volition; for we can smile or frown spontaneously, can make  water before the quantity or acrimony of the urine produces a disagreeable  sensation, and can voluntarily masticate a nauseous drug, or swallow a  bitter draught, though our sensation would strongly dissuade us.    2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are most frequently  excited by our sensations, are nevertheless occasionally causeable by  volition, as we can spontaneously call up our last night's dream before us,  tracing it industriously step by step through all its variety of scenery  and transaction; or can voluntarily examine or repeat the ideas, that have  been excited by out disgust or admiration.    III. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of motions are associated with these  sensitive muscular motions above mentioned; as when a drop of water falling  into the wind-pipe disagreeably affects the air-vessels of the lungs, they  are excited into violent action; and with these sensitive motions are  associated the actions of the pectoral and intercostal muscles, and the  diaphragm; till by their united and repeated succussions the drop is  returned through the larinx. The same occurs when any thing disagreeably  affects the nostrils, or the stomach, or the uterus; variety of muscles are  excited by association into forcible action, not to be suppressed by the  utmost efforts of the will; as in sneezing, vomiting, and parturition.    2. In like manner with these sensitive sensual motions, or ideas of  imagination, are associated many other trains or tribes of ideas, which by  some writers of metaphysics have been classed under the terms of  resemblance, causation, and contiguity; and will be more fully treated of  hereafter.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. IX.    OF VOLUNTARY MOTIONS.        I. 1. _Voluntary muscular motions are originally excited by      irritations._ 2. _And voluntary ideas. Of reason._ II. 1. _Voluntary      muscular motions are occasionally causable by sensations._ 2. _And      voluntary ideas._ III. 1. _Voluntary muscular motions are occasionally      obedient to irritations._ 2. _And voluntary ideas._ IV. 1. _Voluntary      muscular motions are associated with other muscular motions._ 2. _And      voluntary ideas._    When pleasure or pain affect the animal system, many of its motions both  muscular and sensual are brought into action; as was shewn in the preceding  section, and were called sensitive motions. The general tendency of these  motions is to arrest and to possess the pleasure, or to dislodge or avoid  the pain: but if this cannot immediately be accomplished, desire or  aversion are produced, and the motions in consequence of this new faculty  of the sensorium are called voluntary.    I. 1. Those muscles of the body that are attached to bones, have in general  their principal connections with volition, as I move my pen or raise my  body. These motions were originally excited by irritation, as was explained  in the section on that subject, afterwards the sensations of pleasure or  pain, that accompanied the motions thus excited, induced a repetition of  them; and at length many of them were voluntarily practised in succession  or in combination for the common purposes of life, as in learning to walk,  or to speak; and are performed with strength and velocity in proportion to  the energy of the volition, that excites them, and the quantity of  sensorial power.    2. Another great class of voluntary motions consists of the ideas of  recollection. We will to repeat a certain train of ideas, as of the  alphabet backwards; and if any ideas, that do not belong to this intended  train, intrude themselves by other connections, we will to reject them, and  voluntarily persist in the determined train. So at my approach to a house  which I have but once visited, and that at the distance of many months, I  will to recollect the names of the numerous family I expect to see there,  and I do recollect them.    On this voluntary recollection of ideas our faculty of reason depends, as  it enables us to acquire an idea of the dissimilitude of any two ideas.  Thus if you voluntarily produce the idea of a right-angled triangle, and  then of a square; and after having excited these ideas repeatedly, you  excite the idea of their difference, which is that of another right-angled  triangle inverted over the former; you are said to reason upon this  subject, or to compare your ideas.    These ideas of recollection, like the muscular motions above mentioned,  were originally excited by the irritation of external bodies, and were  termed ideas of perception: afterwards the pleasure or pain, that  accompanied these motions, induced a repetition of them in the absence of  the external body, by which they were first excited; and then they were  termed ideas of imagination. At length they become voluntarily practised in  succession or in combination for the common purposes of life; as when we  make ourselves masters of the history of mankind, or of the sciences they  have investigated; and are then called ideas of recollection; and are  performed with strength and velocity in proportion to the energy of the  volition that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power.    II. 1. The muscular motions above described, that are most frequently  obedient to the will are nevertheless occasionally causable by painful or  pleasurable sensation, as in the starting from fear, and the contraction of  the calf of the leg in the cramp.    2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are most frequently  connected with volition, are nevertheless occasionally causable by painful  or pleasurable sensation. As the histories of men, or the description of  places, which we have voluntarily taken pains to remember, sometimes occur  to us in our dreams.    III. 1. The muscular motions that are generally subservient to volition,  are also occasionally causable by irritation, as in stretching the limbs  after sleep, and yawning. In this manner a contraction of the arm is  produced by passing the electric fluid from the Leyden phial along its  muscles; and that even though the limb is paralytic. The sudden motion of  the arm produces a disagreeable sensation in the joint, but the muscles  seem to be brought into action simply by irritation.    2. The ideas, that are generally subservient to the will, are in like  manner occasionally excited by irritation; as when we view again an object,  we have before well studied, and often recollected.    IV. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of motions are associated with these  voluntary muscular motions above mentioned; as when I will to extend my arm  to a distant object, some other muscles are brought into action, and  preserve the balance of my body. And when I wish to perform any steady  exertion, as in threading a needle, or chopping with an ax, the pectoral  muscles are at the same time brought into action to preserve the trunk of  the body motionless, and we cease to respire for a time.    2. In like manner the voluntary sensual motions, or ideas of recollection,  are associated with many other trains or tribes of ideas. As when I  voluntarily recollect a gothic window, that I saw some time ago, the whole  front of the cathedral occurs to me at the same time.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. X.    OF ASSOCIATE MOTIONS.        I. 1. _Many muscular motions excited by irritations in trains or tribes      become associated._ 2. _And many ideas._ II. 1. _Many sensitive      muscular motions become associated._ 2. _And many sensitive ideas._      III. 1. _Many voluntary muscular motions become associated._ 2. _And      then become obedient to sensation or irritation._ 3. _And many      voluntary ideas become associated._    All the fibrous motions, whether muscular or sensual, which are frequently  brought into action together, either in combined tribes, or in successive  trains, become so connected by habit, that when one of them is reproduced  the others have a tendency to succeed or accompany it.    I. 1. Many of our muscular motions were originally excited in successive  trains, as the contractions of the auricles and of the ventricles of the  heart; and others in combined tribes, as the various divisions of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15709"],[0,"The Christmas Angel (#9)"],[1,"aps, like a schoolboy, he crossed the street and ran up  the steps of Number 87. The Christmas Angel seemed to smile with ineffable  sweetness as he gave the bell a vigorous pull.          CHAPTER XIV    TOM      Miss Terry was leaning on the mantel-shelf looking into the fire, when the  bell pealed furiously. She started and turned pale.    \"Lord 'a' mercy!\" ejaculated Norah, who was still admiring the effect of  the window-decoration. \"What's that? Who can be calling here to-night,  making such a noise?\"    \"Go to the door, Norah,\" said Miss Terry with a strange note in her voice.  \"It may be some one to see me. It is not too late.\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Norah, obedient but bewildered.    Presently the library door opened and a figure strode in; a tall,  broad-shouldered man in a fur overcoat. For a moment he stood just inside  the door, hesitating. Miss Terry took two steps forward from the  fire-place.    \"Tom!\" she said faintly. \"You came,--after all!\"    \"After all, Angelina,\" he said. \"Yes, because I saw _that_,\" he waved his  hand toward the window. \"That gave me courage to come in. It is our  Christmas Angel. I remember all about it. Does it mean anything, Angelina?\"    Miss Terry held out a moment longer. Then she faltered forward. \"O Tom!\"  she sobbed, as she felt his brotherly, strong arms about her. \"O Tom! And  so he has brought you back to me, and me to you!\"    \"He? Angelina girl, who?\" He smoothed her silver hair with rough, kind  fingers.    \"Why, the Christmas Angel; our Guardian Angel, Tom. All these years I kept  him in the play box, and I was going to burn him up. But I couldn't do it,  Tom. How wonderful it is!\"    They sat down before the fire and she began to tell him the whole story.  But she interrupted herself to send for Norah, who came to her, mystified  and half scandalized by the greeting which she had seen those two oldsters  exchange.    \"This is my brother Tom, Norah, who has come back,\" she said. \"I believe it  is not too late to make some preparation for Christmas Day. The stores will  still be open. Run out and order things for a grand occasion, Norah. And--O  Norah!\" a sudden remembrance came to her. \"If you have time, will you  please get some toys and pretty things such as a little girl would like; a  little girl of about ten, with my complexion,--I mean, with yellow hair and  blue eyes. We may have a little guest to-morrow.\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Norah, moving like one in a dream.    \"A guest?\" exclaimed Tom. And Miss Terry told him about Mary.    \"I love little girls,\" said Tom, \"especially little girls with yellow hair  and blue eyes, such as you used to have, Angelina.\"    \"You will like Mary, then,\" said Miss Terry, with a pretty pink flush of  pleasure in her cheeks.    \"I shall like her, _if_ she comes,\" amended Tom, who, man-like, received  with reservations the account of a vision vouchsafed not unto him.    \"She will come,\" said Miss Terry with her old positiveness, glancing  towards the window where the Christmas Angel hung.    Then arose the sound of singing outside the house. The passing choristers  had spied the quaint window, now the only one in the street which remained  lighted:--        \"When Christ was born of Mary free,      In Bethlehem, in that fair citye,      Angels sang with mirth and glee,        _In Excelsis Gloria!_\"          CHAPTER XV    CHRISTMAS DAY      And Mary came. The brother and sister were at breakfast,--the happiest  which either of them had known for years,--when there came a timid pull at  the front-door bell. Miss Angelina laid down her knife and fork and looked  across the table at Tom.    \"She has come. Mary has come,\" she said. \"Norah, if it is a little girl  with a package under her arm, bring her in here.\"    \"Yes'm!\" gasped Norah, who believed she was living in a dream where  everything was topsy-turvy. When had a child entered Miss Terry's  dining-room!    Norah disappeared and presently returned ushering in a little girl of ten,  with blue eyes and yellow hair. Under her arm she carried a white-paper  package, very badly wrapped.    Miss Terry exchanged with her brother a glance which said, \"I told you so!\"    The child seemed bashful and afraid to speak; no wonder!    Tom's kind heart yearned to her. \"Good morning! Wish you a merry  Christmas, Mary!\" he said smiling.    The child gave a start. \"Why, how did you know my name?\" she cried.    Tom looked confused. How indeed did he know? But Miss Angelina, with a  readiness that surprised herself, came to his rescue.    \"We were talking of a little girl named Mary,\" she said. \"And you look just  like her. What did you come for, dear?\"    The little girl hung her head and turned crimson.    \"I--I came to see Angelina Terry,\" she whispered. \"I--I've got a doll that  belongs to her.\"    There was a pause, then Miss Terry said, \"Well, go on.\"    \"I--I found her on the steps of this house last night, and I ought to  have brought her right here then. But I didn't. I took her home. I hope  Angelina was not very unhappy last night.\"    Miss Terry smiled upon Tom, who gave a kind, low laugh.    \"No,\" said Miss Terry. \"Angelina did not worry about her lost doll. She was  thinking about something else,--the nicest Christmas present that ever  anybody had. But you were a good girl to bring back the doll.\"    \"No, I'm not a good girl,\" said Mary, and her voice trembled. \"I was a  wicked girl. I meant to keep Miranda for myself, because I thought she  would be a lovely big doll. And when I found she was old and homely,  somehow I still wanted to keep her. But it was stealing, and I couldn't.  Please, will you give her to Angelina, and tell her I am so sorry?\" She  took Miranda out of the wrapping and held her toward Miss Terry without  looking at the doll. It was as if she were afraid of being tempted once  more.    [Illustration: MARY RETURNS THE DOLL]    Miss Terry did not take the doll.    \"I am Angelina,\" she said. \"The doll was mine.\"    \"You! Angelina!\" the child's face was full of bewilderment. Mechanically  she drew Miranda to her and clasped her close.    \"Yes, I am Angelina, and that was my doll Miranda,\" said Miss Terry gently.  \"Thank you for returning her. But Mary,--your name is Mary?\" The child  nodded.--\"Suppose I wanted you to keep her for me, what would you say?\"    Mary's eyes still dwelt upon Miss Terry with a puzzled look. This  gray-haired Angelina was so different from the one she had pictured. She  did not answer the question. Miss Terry drew the child to a chair beside  her.    \"Tell me all about yourself, Mary,\" she said.    After some coaxing and prompting from what they already guessed, Mary told  the story of her sad little life.    She was an orphan recently left to the care of her uncle and aunt, who had  received her grudgingly. They were her sole relatives; and the shame of  their degraded lives was plain through the outlines of the vague picture  which Mary sketched of them.    \"You do not love them, Mary?\" asked Miss Terry kindly.    \"No,\" answered the child. \"They always speak crossly to me. When they have  been drinking they beat me.\"    Tom rose from the table with a muttered word and began to pace the floor.  His blue eyes were full of tears.    \"Mary,\" said Miss Terry, \"will the people at home be worried if you do not  come back to dinner?\"    Mary shook her head wonderingly. \"No,\" she said. \"They will not care. I am  often away on holidays. I go to the Museums.\"    \"Then I want you to stay with us to-day,\" said Miss Terry. \"We are going  to have a Christmas celebration, and we need you for a guest. Will you  stay, you and Miranda?\"    Mary looked down at the doll in her arms, and up at the two kind faces bent  toward her. \"Yes,\" she said impulsively, \"I will stay. How good you are! I  don't want to go home.\"    \"Don't go home!\" burst out Tom. \"Stay with us always and be our little  girl.\"    Mary looked from one to the other, half frightened at the new idea. Miss  Terry bent and pecked at her cheek, with a thrill at the new sensation.    \"Yes, we mean it,\" she said, and her voice was almost sweet. \"We believe  that the Christmas Angel has brought you to us, Mary. You have the  Christmas name. But you seem to us like the little girl we both knew best,  little Angelina with blue eyes and yellow hair, who was Miranda's mother.  Will you stay with us, Mary Angelina? Would you like to stay?\"    Mary looked up with a wistful smile. \"You are so good!\" she said again. \"I  wish I could stay. But Uncle and Aunt are so--I am afraid of what they  might do to us all. If they thought you wanted me, they would not let me  go.\"    \"I will fix Uncle and Aunt,\" said Tom, going for his coat. \"Leave them to  me. I know an argument that settles uncles and aunts of that sort. You need  not go back to their house, I promise you, Mary, my dear.\"    Mary gave a great sigh of relief. \"Oh, I am so glad!\" she said. \"It was  such a wicked house. And here it is so good!\"    \"Good!\" Miss Terry echoed the word with a sigh. \"Come with me, Mary,\" she  said.    She led her little guest through the hall to the library, where a great  fire was blazing, with sundry mysterious packages in white paper piled on  the table beside it. But Miss Terry did not stop at the fire-place. She  drew Mary to the window which looked out on the sidewalk. Above the lower  sash Mary saw the remains of a burned-out Christmas candle; and over it  hung a pink papier-mache Angel stretching out open arms towards her.    \"This is the Christmas Angel, Mary,\" said Miss Terry. \"He is as old as  Miranda--\"    \"He is as old as Christmas,\" interrupted Tom, looking in from the hall.    \"When we were children, Tom and I, we hung him on our Christmas tree,\" went  on Miss Terry. \"We think he brought you to us. We believe he has changed  the world for us,--has brought us peace, good-will, and happiness. He is  going to be the guardian angel of our house. You must love him, Mary.\"    \"How beautiful he is!\" said Mary reverently. "]]]
