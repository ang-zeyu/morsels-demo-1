Like the majority of the musicians of the ruder  tribes, the excellence of their music depends on the noise which is  made, and if it be so obstreperous, as almost to deafen the auditors,  the greater is the pleasure which is shown.    These wandering minstrels are frequently attended by the Greegree  men, or sorcerers, who, on account of the fantastic dress which they  wear, form a most motley group; the Greegree men, trying to outvie  each other in the hideous and fantastic style of their dress, and the  more frightful they make themselves appear, the greater they believe  is the effect of their sorcery. The principal festivals are those of  circumcision and of funeral. Whenever former ceremony is performed, a  vast concourse of people are attracted, from every part of the  country, the operator being generally a Greegree man, who pretends to  determine the future fate of the individual, in the manner by which  the operation is performed, but which is always declared to be highly  prosperous, if a liberal present has been made. During the  performance of the ceremony, the forests appear in a blaze, the most  discordant shouts rending the air, intermixed with the sounds of  their instruments, composing altogether a tumult, which is heard at  the distance of many leagues. The dancing is described as of the most  ludicrous kind, marked by those indecencies, which generally  distinguish the amusements of the savage tribes. In these sports, the  women are always the foremost in the violence of their gestures; the  young ones selecting the objects of their affection, to bestow upon  them some token of their attachment.    The funeral of their chiefs is a ceremony of great solemnity, and in  some of its forms has a strong resemblance to an Irish wake. Flowers  of the most odorous scent are buried with the corpse, which is also  supplied with a considerable quantity of gold, to assist him on his  entrance into the other world, where it is believed, that the degree  of happiness, is proportionate to the quantity of gold which the  deceased has in his possession. It must, however, be mentioned, that  the natives of this part of Africa, appear to be wholly exempt from  the stigma, which belongs to some of the other tribes of Africa,  in the human victims which are sacrificed at the funerals of their  kings or chiefs, and which in some cases amount to three or four  hundred. The funerals of the kings of Tenda are conducted with a  decorum highly creditable to the people, considering their  uncivilised state; and the graves are frequently visited by the  relatives of the deceased, to repair any injury, which they may have  sustained from the violence of the rains, or the attacks of  carnivorous animals.    At all the festivals, a personage called Horey, or which Jobson calls  the devil, acts a most conspicuous part, at the same time, that he  generally carries on his operations in secret, impressing thereby on  the minds of the natives, an idea of his invisibility. The Horey  generally takes his station in the adjoining woods, whence he sends  forth the most tremendous sounds, supposed to have a very malignant  influence on all those who happen to be within hearing. It is,  however, a fortunate circumstance for the native, who is so  unfortunate as to be within hearing of the Horey's cries, that the  method is known, of appeasing the vindictive spirit of the Horey,  which is, by placing a quantity of provisions, in the immediate  vicinity of the place where his roaring is heard; and if on the  following day the provisions have disappeared, which is sure to be  the case, the natives are then satisfied that the Horey has been  appeased, which, however, lasts only for a short time, for as the  appetite of the Horey is certain to return, his cries are again  heard, and the provisions are again deposited for his satisfaction.    In regard to this Horey or devil, rather a ludicrous story is told by  Jobson, who, being in company with a Marabout, and hearing the Horey  in full cry in a neighbouring thicket, seized a loaded musket,  declaring his resolution aloud, to discharge the contents without any  further ceremony, at his infernal majesty. Dreading the consequences,  which might befal the whole nation, were the devil to be killed, the  Marabout implored Jobson to desist from his murderous design; on a  sudden, the hoarse roar of the Horey was changed into a low and  plaintive sound, expressive of an individual imploring mercy from his  destroyer;--again Jobson levelled his gun at the spot whence the  sound issued, when on a sudden, his infernal majesty presented  himself in the shape of a huge negro, bloated with fat, and who now  lay on the ground, his devilish spirit quelled, and apparently in  such an agony of fear, as to be unable to sue for the mercy of the  avenging Englishman, who stood laughing over him, at the idea of  having so easily vanquished an African devil.    The dissensions, which took place amongst the company, on the return  of Jobson, put an end for a time to all further discoveries. It was  evident that these divisions in the company, arose from a spirit of  jealousy amongst certain members of it, who had formed amongst  themselves certain schemes of personal aggrandizement, and were  therefore unwilling to despatch any one into those quarters, in which  such abundant sources presented themselves, of amassing inexhaustible  riches.    The next attempt was made by Vermuyden, an opulent merchant, on the  Gambia, about the year 1660 or 1665, who equipped a boat abundantly  stored with bacon, beef, biscuit, rice, strong waters, and other  comfortable supplies, the weight of which, however, was so great,  that on arriving at the flats and shallows, the vessel could not  proceed on her voyage without the greatest danger. After navigating  the shallows for some time, he arrived at a broad expanse of water,  which he compared to Windermere Lake, and he now found himself on a  sudden entangled in a great difficulty, owing to a number of streams  flowing into this lake, and the consequent uncertainty which existed,  of choosing that particular one, which might be considered the main  branch or stream; and were he to ascend any other, he might find that  all his labours had been spent in vain, as it might lead him to a  quarter, at a great distance from those stations and towns, where the  Europeans had established their commercial settlements. \"Up the  buffing stream,\" says Vermuyden, \"with sad labour we wrought,\" and  when he had ascended further up the stream, the sailors were often  obliged to strip themselves naked, and get into the water. This was  found, however, to be a most dangerous experiment, for the crocodiles  and river horses showed themselves in fearful numbers, and fully  inclined to treat the intruders on their rightful domain, with the  most marked hostility. Vermuyden says, they were ill pleased, or  unacquainted with any companions in these watery regions, and at all  events, he was convinced that his men were not very proper companions  for them. So daring were the river horses, that one of them struck a  hole in the boat with his teeth, an accident which was rather of a  serious nature, as there was no one on board possessing any skill in  carpentry; and as one attack had been made, great apprehension was  entertained that it might be renewed, and the consequences prove of  the most fatal kind. They, however, fell upon the expedient of fixing  a lantern at the stern of the vessel, which kept the monsters at a  respectful distance; they showing great alarm at any light shining in  the dark. On one occasion, when they landed for the purpose of  searching for gold, they found the territory guarded by an incredible  number of huge baboons, who seemed determined to enter into open  conflict with them, and to set at defiance every attempt that was  made to penetrate into the territory. If the sailors shouted to them;  the baboons set up a loud scream, showing their white teeth, and  making known the reception which the intruders would meet with, if  they made any further advances.    Finding that neither their oratory nor their menaces had any effect  upon the baboon army, a few guns were discharged at them, which  seemed rather to astonish them, for it was something which they had  never seen nor heard before; but as no immediate effect was visible  amongst their army, they began to consider the firing as a sort of  joke, and prepared to drive the invaders back to their boats. A  volley, however, from the human assailants, by which three of the  baboon army were laid prostrate, soon convinced the latter, that the  firing was no joke, and after making some slight show of resistance,  they carried away the dead, and retreated to the woods.    The discovery of gold being the principal object of the adventure of  Vermuyden, he landed frequently in different places, and proceeded to  wash the sand, and examine the rocks. Vermuyden had acquired, in his  native country, some slight knowledge of alchymy, and he carried out  with him not only mercury, aqua regia, and large melting pots, but  also a divining rod, which, however, as was most likely the case, was  not found to exhibit any virtue. Vermuyden, however, was not to be  laughed out of his superstitious notions, although his companions  took every opportunity of turning his expectations into ridicule, but  he found a very plausible excuse for the impotency of his divining  rod in the discovery, that its qualities had all been dried up by the  heat of the climate, and that, under every circumstance, it was not  an instrument adapted to the country in which it was to be carried  into use. On one occasion, however, the virtue of the divining rod  appeared suddenly to have returned, for his eyes were gladdened with  the sight of a large mass of apparent gold; the delusion, however,  soon vanished, for, on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1," Lord Howe Island, which they had seen the day  before, north 27 degrees 40 minutes east, distant 39 leagues. This was  supposed to be the same shoal that had been formerly seen by Lieutenant  Shortland* in the _Alexander_, and by the master of the _Golden  Grove_ transport in the year 1786.    [* Vide Vol I Ch. VII, viz: 'Lieutenant Shortland, in his  letter, noticed some discoveries which he had made; particularly one of  an extensive and dangerous shoal, which obtained the name of Middleton  Shoal, and was reckoned to be in the latitude of 29 degrees 20 minutes  South, and in the longitude of 158 degrees 40 minutes East. He had also  discovered an island, which he placed in the latitude of 28 degrees 10  minutes South, and in the longitude of 159 degrees 50 minutes East, and  named Sir Charles Middleton Island: his other discoveries, not being so  immediately in the vicinity of this territory, were not likely to be of  any advantage to the settlement; but it was of some importance to it to  learn that an extensive reef was so near, and to find its situation  ascertained to be in the track of ships bound from hence to the  northward; for if Sir Charles Middleton Island should hereafter be found  to possess a safe and convenient harbour, it might prove an interesting  discovery for this colony.']    In the beginning of this month, the settlers at the Hawkesbury sent round  some grain, in part payment of the debts which were due from them to  government for the seed which had been lent them last year to crop their  grounds.    In consequence of complaints which were laid before the governor,  relative to some exorbitant demands made by the public bakers upon those  who had occasion to employ them, and of the impositions practised as well  in the quality as in the quantity of the bread returned in lieu of the  flour or grain delivered to them, the judge-advocate and two other  magistrates were directed to hold a meeting for the purpose of enquiring  into the business, as well as for examining and regulating the weights  and measures which were at present in use in the colony. An order was at  the same time issued, recommending to the settlers of every district,  that, as much pains had been taken to establish, agreeably to their  wishes, the rate of wages to be paid for all kinds of labour, they should  now attend strictly to this regulation, and no longer suffer themselves  to be imposed upon. There were strong reasons for suspecting that,  notwithstanding the bond which they had entered into, rigidly to adhere  to the regulations which had been established for their benefit, some  among them were so very deficient of even honest principles as to attempt  by various means to evade the regulation, to the great injury of other  more industrious and more deserving men. In order the more readily to  detect a practice so shameful and iniquitous, the governor judged it  requisite to hold out a reward to those who would come forward and give  such information as should be sufficient to prove the offence, by  offering one-third of the sum forfeited to the informer. The settlers were  also called upon to give information of any labouring man who, on  offering himself for hire, should refuse to accept the regulated wages.  As such person must be incapable of living in this country without work,  he was immediately to be apprehended as a vagrant, who, having no visible  means of providing honestly for his support, must have recourse to  robbery.    The natives at the Hawkesbury were at this time very troublesome, burning  a dwelling-house and a stack of wheat belonging to a settler there, after  having plundered him of all his other possessions.    On the 21st, as much wheat as the public granaries at Sydney, Parramatta,  and the Hawkesbury could contain, having been received, they were closed  until the month of August next.    Towards the latter end of the month, the governor, accompanied by some  gentlemen of the settlement, set off from Parramatta, on an excursion, in  which he meant to obtain some knowledge of the ground between Duck river  and George's river, with respect both to its quality and quantity. This  tract was walked over, and much excellent land was found well provided  with fresh water in chains of large deep ponds. On this ground some of  the marine soldiers, who had enlisted for three years in the New South  Wales corps, having completed their service, were desirous of being  settled.    This party, on their arrival at the banks of George's river, whither a  boat had been previously sent with some provisions and a tent, found that  at low water it was as fresh as that in the Hawkesbury, where the  settlement stood.    Having proceeded down the river, they stopped at a point near Botany Bay,  where they met with several parties of natives, among whom was Pe-mul-wy,  who, having perfectly recovered from his wounds, had escaped from the  hospital with an iron about his leg. He saw and spoke with one of the  gentlemen of the party; enquiring of him whether the governor was angry,  and seemed pleased at being told that he was not: notwithstanding which,  there could be but little doubt that his savage brutal disposition would  manifest itself whenever excited by the appearance of an unarmed man.    Some time in this month a tree was for the first time observed growing on  the banks of the Hawkesbury, the bark of which, when soaked in water, and  beaten, was found to be as good as hemp for cordage, spinning easily, and  being remarkably strong. The tree grew from 50 to 70 feet high; its  diameter was from the smallest size to a foot, and it appeared to be of  quick growth. This was rather a fortunate discovery; for every kind of  cordage belonging to the settlement was almost wholly expended.    The court of criminal judicature was assembled once in this month, and  three persons who had served their period of transportation were a second  time transported; one for 14 years, for receiving stolen goods knowing  them to be such; and two others for seven years. These two last were  vagabonds who had taken up their abode in the woods, where they lived at  the expense of the industrious, by committing every kind of depredation  on their property.    The public works continued the same as at the end of the last month. The  foundation of the building for the reception of the assistant surgeons  was laid, and the lower floor of the large granary at Sydney was nearly  completed.    Much rain fell during this month. On the morning of the 27th, a heavy  squall of wind came on, which, for want of proper care and attention on  the part of those employed at the wind-mill, set it going in such a  violent manner, that while flying round with great velocity, one of the  running stones was broken to pieces; one of which so severely wounded  Davis the millwright in the head, that his life was despaired of. A gang  of carpenters was immediately ordered to repair the damage it had  sustained, and in a few days it was again at work.    May.] Notwithstanding the example which had lately been made of the  natives, they were exceedingly troublesome to the settlers in Lane Cove,  burning a house and killing some hogs belonging to one of them. This was  certainly committing a wanton injury; for neither the burnt house, nor  the slaughtered animals, which they left on the spot, could be of any  benefit to them. At Kissing Point, another district, they dangerously  wounded a settler and his wife, first burning every article belonging to  them. The settlers in Lane Cove were so much and so perpetually alarmed  by these people, that they collected their whole force, and, a few  soldiers being sent to their assistance, went out in the night; and,  being directed by their fires to the place where they lay, they  discovered a large body of natives, collected, no doubt, for the purpose  of attacking and plundering the settlers. Being unwilling to take any of  their lives, a volley of musketry was fired over their heads, which so  alarmed and terrified them, that they instantly fled, leaving behind them  their spears, etc. and about 20 bushels of Indian corn which they had  stolen.    It was distressing to observe, that every endeavour to civilise these  people proved fruitless. Although they lived among the inhabitants of the  different settlements, were kindly treated, fed, and often clothed, yet  they were never found to possess the smallest degree of gratitude for  such favours. Even Bennillong was as destitute of this quality as the  most ignorant of his countrymen. It is an extraordinary fact, that even  their children, who had been bred up among the white people, and who,  from being accustomed to follow their manner of living, might have been  supposed to ill relish the life of their parents, when grown up, have  quitted their comfortable abodes, females as well as males, and taken to  the same savage mode of living, where the supply of food was often  precarious, their comforts not to be called such, and their lives  perpetually in danger. As a proof of the little personal safety which  they enjoyed, a young woman, the wife of a man named Ye-ra-ni-be, both of  whom had been brought up in the settlement from their childhood, was  cruelly murdered at the brick-fields by her husband, assisted by another  native, Cole-be, who first beat her dreadfully about the head (the common  mode of chastising their women), and then put an end to her existence by  driving a spear through her heart.    When spoken to or censured for robbing the maize-grounds, these people,  to be revenged, were accustomed to assemble in large bodies, burn the  houses of the settlers if they stood in lonely situations, and frequently  attempted to take their lives; yet they were seldom refused a little corn  when they would ask for it. It was imagined that they were stimulated to  this destructive conduct by some run-away convicts who were known to be  among them at "]]]
