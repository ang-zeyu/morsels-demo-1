They were encouraged in  their wrong attitude by the false apostles. The result was that the  people were up in arms against Paul and his doctrine.    Paul did not condemn circumcision as if it were a sin to receive it.  But he insisted, and the conference upheld him, that circumcision had  no bearing upon salvation and was therefore not to be forced upon the  Gentiles. The conference agreed that the Jews should be permitted to  keep their ancient customs for the time being, so long as they did not  regard those customs as conveying God's justification of the sinner.    The false apostles were dissatisfied with the verdict of the conference.  They did not want to rest circumcision and the practice of the Law in  Christian liberty. They insisted that circumcision was obligatory unto  salvation.    As the opponents of Paul, so our own adversaries [Luther's, the enemies  of the Reformation] contend that the traditions of the Fathers dare not  be neglected without loss of salvation. Our opponents will not agree  with us on anything. They defend their blasphemies. They go as far to  enforce them with the sword.    Paul's victory was complete. Titus, who was with Paul, was not compelled  to be circumcised, although he stood in the midst of the apostles when  this question of circumcision was debated. This was a blow to the  false apostles. With the living fact that Titus was not compelled to be  circumcised Paul was able to squelch his adversaries.        VERSES 4,5. And that because of false brethren unawares brought in,    who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ    Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: To whom we gave place by    subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might    continue with you.    Paul here explains his motive for going up to Jerusalem. He did not go  to Jerusalem to be instructed or confirmed in his Gospel by the other  apostles. He went to Jerusalem in order to preserve the true Gospel for  the Galatian churches and for all the churches of the Gentiles.    When Paul speaks of the truth of the Gospel he implies by contrast a  false gospel. The false apostles also had a gospel, but it was an untrue  gospel. \"In holding out against them,\" says Paul, \"I conserved the truth  of the pure Gospel.\"    Now the true Gospel has it that we are justified by faith alone, without  the deeds of the Law. The false gospel has it that we are justified by  faith, but not without the deeds of the Law. The false apostles preached  a conditional gospel.    So do the papists. They admit that faith is the foundation of salvation.  But they add the conditional clause that faith can save only when it is  furnished with good works. This is wrong. The true Gospel declares that  good works are the embellishment of faith, but that faith itself is the  gift and work of God in our hearts. Faith is able to justify, because it  apprehends Christ, the Redeemer.    Human reason can think only in terms of the Law. It mumbles: \"This I  have done, this I have not done.\" But faith looks to Jesus Christ, the  Son of God, given into death for the sins of the whole world. To turn  one's eyes away from Jesus means to turn them to the Law.    True faith lays hold of Christ and leans on Him alone. Our opponents  cannot understand this. In their blindness they cast away the precious  pearl, Christ, and hang onto their stubborn works. They have no idea  what faith is. How can they teach faith to others?    Not satisfied with teaching an untrue gospel, the false apostles tried  to entangle Paul. \"They went about,\" says Paul, \"to spy out our liberty  which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.\"    When Paul saw through their scheme, he attacked the false apostles. He  says, \"We did not let go of the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus.  We routed them by the judgment of the apostles, and we would not give in  to them, no, not an inch.\"    We too were willing to make all kinds of concessions to the papists.  Yes, we are willing to offer them more than we should. But we will not  give up the liberty of conscience which we have in Christ Jesus. We  refuse to have our conscience bound by any work or law, so that by doing  this or that we should be righteous, or leaving this or that undone we  should be damned.    Since our opponents will not let it stand that only faith in Christ  justifies, we will not yield to them. On the question of justification  we must remain adamant, or else we shall lose the truth of the Gospel.  It is a matter of life and death. It involves the death of the Son  of God, who died for the sins of the world. If we surrender faith  in Christ, as the only thing that can justify us, the death and  resurrection of Jesus are without meaning; that Christ is the Savior  of the world would be a myth. God would be a liar, because He would not  have fulfilled His promises. Our stubbornness is right, because we want  to preserve the liberty which we have in Christ. Only by preserving our  liberty shall we be able to retain the truth of the Gospel inviolate.    Some will object that the Law is divine and holy. Let it be divine and  holy. The Law has no right to tell me that I must be justified by it.  The Law has the right to tell me that I should love God and my neighbor,  that I should live in chastity, temperance, patience, etc. The Law has  no right to tell me how I may be delivered from sin, death, and hell. It  is the Gospel's business to tell me that. I must listen to the Gospel.  It tells me, not what I must do, but what Jesus Christ, the Son of God,  has done for me.    To conclude, Paul refused to circumcise Titus for the reason that the  false apostles wanted to compel him to circumcise Titus. Paul refused to  accede to their demands. If they had asked it on the plea of brotherly  love, Paul would not have denied them. But because they demanded it on  the ground that it was necessary for salvation, Paul defied them, and  prevailed. Titus was not circumcised.        VERSE 6. But of those who seemed to be somewhat, whatsoever they    were, it maketh no matter to me.    This is a good point in Paul's refutation. Paul disparages the authority  and dignity of the true apostles. He says of them, \"Which seemed to be  somewhat.\" The authority of the apostles was indeed great in all the  churches. Paul did not want to detract from their authority, but he had  to speak disparagingly of their authority in order to conserve the truth  of the Gospel, and the liberty of conscience.    The false apostles used this argument against Paul: \"The apostles lived  with Christ for three years. They heard His sermons. They witnessed His  miracles. They themselves preached and performed miracles while Christ  was on earth. Paul never saw Jesus in the flesh. Now, whom ought you to  believe: Paul, who stands alone, a mere disciple of the apostles, one  of the last and least; or will you believe those grand apostles who were  sent and confirmed by Christ Himself long before Paul?\"    What could Paul say to that? He answered: \"What they say has no bearing  on the argument. If the apostles were angels from heaven, that would not  impress me. We are not now discussing the excellency of the apostles. We  are talking about the Word of God now, and the truth of the Gospel. That  Gospel is more excellent than all apostles.\"        VERSE 6. God accepteth no man's person.    Paul is quoting Moses: \"Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor,  nor honor the person of the mighty.\" (Lev. 19:15) This quotation from  Moses ought to shut the mouths of the false apostles. \"Don't you  know that God is no respecter of persons?\" cries Paul. The dignity  or authority of men means nothing to God. The fact is that God often  rejects just such who stand in the odor of sanctity and in the aura  of importance. In doing so God seems unjust and harsh. But men need  deterring examples. For it is a vice with us to esteem personality more  highly than the Word of God. God wants us to exalt His Word and not men.    There must be people in high office, of course. But we are not to deify  them. The governor, the mayor, the preacher, the teacher, the scholar,  father, mother, are persons whom we are to love and revere, but not to  the extent that we forget God. Least we attach too much importance  to the person, God leaves with important persons offenses and sins,  sometimes astounding shortcomings, to show us that there is a lot of  difference between any person and God. David was a good king. But when  the people began to think too well of him, down he fell into horrible  sins, adultery and murder. Peter, excellent apostle that he was, denied  Christ. Such examples of which the Scriptures are full, ought to warn  us not to repose our trust in men. In the papacy appearance counts for  everything. Indeed, the whole papacy amounts to nothing more than a mere  kowtowing of persons and outward mummery. But God alone is to be feared  and honored.    I would honor the Pope, I would love his person, if he would leave my  conscience alone, and not compel me to sin against God. But the Pope  wants to be adored himself, and that cannot be done without offending  God. Since we must choose between one or the other, let us choose God.  The truth is we are commissioned by God to resist the Pope, for it is  written, \"We ought to obey God rather than men.\" (Acts 5:29)    We have seen how Paul refutes the argument of the false apostles  concerning the authority of the apostles. In order that the truth of the  Gospel may continue; in order that the Word of God and the righteousness  of faith may be kept pure and undefiled, let the apostles, let an angel  from heaven, let Peter, let Paul, let them all perish.        VERSE 6. For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added    nothing to me.    The Apostle repeats: \"I did not so confer with the apostles that they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535"],[0,"Violin Mastery: Talks with Master Violinists and Teachers (#9)"],[1,"which  is so largely made up of personalities. He is a composer--not only of  violin pieces, but of symphonic and choral works, chamber music, songs  and piano numbers. His critical analysis of Bach's _Chaconne_,  translated into well-nigh every tongue, is probably the most complete  and exhaustive study of \"that triumph of genius over matter\" written.  And besides being a master of his own instrument he plays the _viola  d'amore_, that sweet-toned survival, with sympathetic strings, of the  17th century viol family, and the Hungarian _czimbalom_. Nor is his  mastery of the last-named instrument \"out of drawing,\" for we must  remember that Mr. Hartmann was born in Mate Szalka, in Southern Hungary.  Then, too, Mr. Hartmann is a genial and original thinker, a  _litterateur_ of no mean ability, a bibliophile, the intimate of the  late Claude Debussy, and of many of the great men of musical Europe. Yet  from the reader's standpoint the interest he inspires is, no doubt,  mainly due to the fact that not only is he a great interpreting  artist--but a great artist doubled by a great teacher, an unusual  combination.         [Illustration: _Photo by E.F. Foley, N.Y._ ARTHUR HARTMANN,                          with hand-written note]    Characteristic of Mr. Hartmann's hospitality (the writer had passed a  pleasant hour with him some years before, but had not seen him since),  was the fact that he insisted in brewing Turkish coffee, and making his  caller feel quite at home before even allowing him to broach the subject  of his visit. And when he learned that its purpose was to draw on his  knowledge and experience for information which would be of value to the  serious student and lover of his art, he did not refuse to respond.                           WHAT VIOLIN PLAYING REALLY IS    \"Violin playing is really no abstract mystery. It's as clear as  geography in a way: one might say the whole art is bounded on the South  by the G string, on the North by the E string, on the West by the  string hand--and that's about as far as the comparison may be carried  out. The point is, there are definite boundaries, whose technical and  esthetic limits may be extended, and territorial annexations made  through brain power, mental control. To me 'Violin Mastery' means taking  this little fiddle-box in hand [and Mr. Hartmann suited action to word  by raising the lid of his violin-case and drawing forth his beautiful  1711 Strad], and doing just what I want with it. And that means having  the right finger on the right place at the right time--but don't forget  that to be able to do this you must have forgotten to think of your  fingers as fingers. They should be simply unconscious slaves of the  artist's psychic expression, absolutely subservient to his ideal. Too  many people reverse the process and become slaves to their fingers.                               THE PROBLEM OF TECHNIC    \"Technic, for instance, in its mechanical sense, is a much exaggerated  microbe of _Materia musica_. All technic must conform to its  instrument.[A] The violin was made to suit the hand, not the hand to  suit the violin, hence its technic must be based on a natural logic of  hand movement. The whole problem of technical control is encountered in  the first change of position on the violin. If we violinists could play  in but one position there would be no technical problem. The solution of  this problem means, speaking broadly, the ability to play the  violin--for there is only one way of playing it--with a real, full,  singing 'violin' tone. It's not a question of a method, but just a  process based on pure reason, the working out of rational principles.    [Footnote A: This is the idea which underlies my system for ear-training  and absolute pitch, \"Arthur Hartmann's System,\" as I call it, which I  have published. A.H.]    \"What is the secret of this singing tone? Well, you may call it a  secret, for many of my pupils have no inkling of it when they first come  here, though it seems very much of an 'open secret' to me. The finished  beauty of the violin 'voice' is a round, sustained, absolutely smooth  _cantabile_ tone. Now [Mr. Hartmann took up his Strad], I'll play you  the scale of G as the average violin student plays it. You see--each  slide from one tone to the next, a break--a rosary of lurches! How can  there be a round, harmonious tone when the fingers progress by jerks?  Shifting position must not be a continuous movement of effort, but a  continuous movement in which effort and relaxation--that of dead  weight--alternate. As an illustration, when we walk we do not  consciously set down one foot, and then swing forward the other foot and  leg with a jerk. The forward movement is smooth, unconscious,  coordinated: in putting the foot forward it carries the weight of the  entire body, the movement becomes a matter of instinct. And the same  applies to the progression of the fingers in shifting the position of  the hand. Now, playing the scale as I now do--only two fingers should be  used--                       [Illustration: Musical Notation]    I prepare every shift. Absolute accuracy of intonation and a singing  legato is the result. These guiding notes indicated are merely a test to  prove the scientific spacing of the violin; they are not sounded once  control of the hand has been obtained. _They serve only to accustom the  fingers to keep moving in the direction in which they are going_.    \"The tone is produced by the left hand, by the weight of the fingers  plus an undercurrent of sustained effort. Now, you see, _if in the  moment of sliding you prepare the bow for the next string, the slide  itself is lost in the crossing of the bow_. To carry out consistently  this idea of effort and relaxation in the downward progression of the  scale, you will find that when you are in the third position, the  position of the hand is practically the same as in the first position.  Hence, in order to go down from third to first position with the hand in  what might be called a 'block' position, another movement is called for  to bridge over this space (between third and first position), and this  movement is the function of the thumb. The thumb, preceding the hand,  relaxes the wrist and helps draw the hand back to first position. But  great care must be taken that the thumb is not moved until the first  finger will have been played; otherwise there will be a tendency to  flatten. In the illustration the indication for the thumb is placed  after the note played by the first finger.    \"The inviolable law of beautiful playing is that there must be no  angles. As I have shown you, right and left hand cooerdinate. The fiddle  hand is preparing the change of position, while the change of strings is  prepared by the right hand. And always the slides in the left hand are  prepared by the last played finger--_the last played finger is the true  guide to smooth progression_--just as the bow hand prepares the slides  in the last played bowing. There should be no such thing as jumping and  trusting in Providence to land right, and a curse ought to be laid on  those who let their fingers leave the fingerboard. None who develop this  fundamental aspect of all good playing lose the perfect control of  position.    \"Of course there are a hundred _nuances_ of technic (into which the  quality of good taste enters largely) that one could talk of at length:  phrasing, and the subtle things happening in the bow arm that influence  it; _spiccato_, whose whole secret is finding the right point of balance  in the bow and, with light finger control, never allowing it to leave  the string. I've never been able to see the virtue of octaves or the  logic of double-stops. Like tenths, one plays or does not play them. But  do they add one iota of beauty to violin music? I doubt it! And, after  all, it is the poetry of playing that counts. All violin playing in its  essence is the quest for color; its perfection, that subtle art which  hides art, and which is so rarely understood.\"    \"Could you give me a few guiding rules, a few Beatitudes, as it were,  for the serious student to follow?\" I asked Mr. Hartmann. Though the  artist smiled at the idea of Beatitudes for the violinist, yet he was  finally amiable enough to give me the following, telling me I would have  to take them for what they were worth:                         NINE BEATITUDES FOR VIOLINISTS    \"Blessed are they who early in life approach Bach, for their love and  veneration for music will multiply with the years.    \"Blessed are they who remember their own early struggles, for their  merciful criticism will help others to a greater achievement and  furtherance of the Divine Art.    \"Blessed are they who know their own limitations, for they shall have  joy in the accomplishment of others.    \"Blessed are they who revere the teachers--their own or those of  others--and who remember them with credit.    \"Blessed are they who, revering the old masters, seek out the newer ones  and do not begrudge them a hearing or two.    \"Blessed are they who work in obscurity, nor sound the trumpet, for Art  has ever been for the few, and shuns the vulgar blare of ignorance.    \"Blessed are they whom men revile as futurists and modernists, for Art  can evolve only through the medium of iconoclastic spirits.    \"Blessed are they who unflinchingly serve their Art, for thus only is  their happiness to be gained.    \"Blessed are they who have many enemies, for square pegs will never fit  into round holes.\"                            ARRANGING VERSUS TRANSCRIBING    Arthur Hartmann, like Kreisler, Elman, Maud Powell and others of his  colleagues, has enriched the literature of the violin with some notably  fine transcriptions.
