Put butter into granite saucepan; when melted add sugar and milk. Heat  to boiling point; then add chocolate, and stir constantly until  chocolate is melted. Boil thirteen minutes, remove from fire, add  vanilla, and beat until creamy and mixture begins to sugar slightly  around edge of saucepan. Pour at once into a buttered pan, cool slightly  and mark in squares. Omit vanilla, and add, while cooking, one-fourth of  a teaspoonful of cinnamon.--_Boston Cooking School Cook Book--Fannie  Merritt Farmer._      MRS. SALZBACHER'S CHOCOLATE HEARTS    Melt, by standing over hot water, three ounces of unsweetened chocolate;  add a pound of sifted powdered sugar and mix thoroughly; work to a stiff  yet pliable paste with the unbeaten whites of three eggs (or less),  adding vanilla to flavor. If the paste seems too soft, add more sugar.  Break off in small pieces and roll out about one-fourth of an inch  thick, sprinkling the board and paste with granulated sugar instead of  flour. Cut with a tiny heart-shaped cake cutter (any other small cake  cutter will do), and place on pans oiled just enough to prevent  sticking. Bake in a very moderate oven. When done, they will feel firm  to the touch, a solid crust having formed over the top. They should be  very light, and will loosen easily from the pan after being allowed to  stand a moment to cool. The success of these cakes depends upon the  oven, which should not be as cool as for meringue, nor quite so hot as  for sponge cake. If properly made, they are very excellent and but  little labor. Use the yolks for chocolate whips.--_From \"Good  Housekeeping.\"_      COCOA CHARLOTTE (Without Cream)        1 pint of water,      Whites of 2 eggs,      1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla,      1/2 a cup of sugar,      2 level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,      1/2 a teaspoonful of cinnamon,      3 tablespoonfuls of cocoa.    Dissolve the cornstarch in a quarter of a cup of cold water, add it to  the pint of boiling water, stir until it thickens, add the sugar and the  cocoa, which have been thoroughly mixed together. Remove from the fire,  add the cinnamon and vanilla, and pour slowly over the stiffly beaten  whites of eggs. Pour at once into a pudding mould, and put away in a  cold place to harden. Serve with plain cream.--_Mabel Richards Dulon._      CHOCOLATE FUDGE WITH FRUIT    Two cups of sugar, one-half cup of milk, one-half cup of molasses,  one-half cup of butter; mix all together and boil seven minutes; add  one-half cup of Baker's Chocolate and boil seven minutes longer. Then  add two tablespoonfuls of figs, two tablespoonfuls of raisins, one-half  a cup of English walnuts and one teaspoonful of vanilla.      CHOCOLATE MACAROONS    Stir to a paste whites of seven eggs, three-fourths a pound of sifted  sugar, one-half a pound of almonds pounded very fine, and two ounces of  grated Baker's Chocolate. Have ready wafer paper cut round, on which lay  pieces of the mixture rolled to fit the wafer. Press one-half a blanched  almond on each macaroon and bake in a moderate oven.      PETITS FOUR    Bake a simple, light sponge cake in a shallow biscuit tin or dripping  pan, and when cold turn out on the moulding board and cut into small  dominoes or diamonds. They should be about an inch in depth. Split each  one and spread jelly or frosting between the layers, then ice tops and  sides with different tinted icings, pale green flavored with pistachio,  pale pink with rose, yellow with orange, white with almond. Little  domino cakes are also pretty. Ice the cakes on top and sides with white  icing, then when hard put on a second layer of chocolate, using _Walter  Baker & Co.'s Unsweetened Chocolate_ and made as for layer cake, dipping  the brush in the melted chocolate to make the spots.    Candied violets, bits of citron cut in fancy shapes, candied cherries  and angelica may all be utilized in making pretty designs in  decoration.--_American Housekeeper._      POTATO CAKE    Two cups of white sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of hot mashed  potatoes, one cup of chopped walnuts, half a cup of sweet milk, two cups  of flour, four eggs well beaten, five teaspoonfuls of melted chocolate,  one tablespoonful each of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg, two teaspoonfuls  of baking powder. Bake in layers and use marshmallow filling.      SPANISH CHOCOLATE CAKE    One cup of sugar, one-half a cup of butter, one-half a cup of sweet  milk, three cups of flour, two eggs, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved  in hot water. Put on the stove one cup of milk, one-half a cup of  Baker's Chocolate, grated; stir until dissolved; then stir into it one  cup of sugar and the yolk of one egg stirred together; when cool flavor  with vanilla. While this is cooling beat up the first part of the cake  and add the chocolate custard. Bake in layers.

(Uncooked Fondant)    [Illustration: PEPPERMINTS, CHOCOLATE MINTS, ETC.]        White of 1 egg,      2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,      Sifted confectioner's sugar,      1/2 teaspoonful of essence of peppermint or a few drops of oil of          peppermint,      1 or 2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      Green color paste,      Pink color paste.    Beat the egg on a plate, add the cold water and gradually work in sugar  enough to make a firm paste. Divide the sugar paste into three parts. To  one part add the peppermint and a very little of the green color paste.  Take the paste from the jar with a wooden tooth pick, add but a little.  Work and knead the mixture until the paste is evenly distributed  throughout. Roll the candy into a sheet one-fourth an inch thick, then  cut out into small rounds or other shape with any utensil that is  convenient. Color the second part a very delicate pink, flavor with rose  extract and cut out in the same manner as the first. To the last part  add one or two squares of Baker's Chocolate, melted over hot water, and  flavor with peppermint. Add also a little water, as the chocolate will  make the mixture thick and crumbly. Begin by adding a tablespoonful of  water, then add more if necessary, knead and cut these as the others.      CHOCOLATE CARAMEL WALNUTS  (Uncooked Fondant)    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE CARAMEL WALNUTS.]        White of 1 egg,      3 tablespoonfuls of maple or caramel syrup,      1 tablespoonful of water,      Sifted confectioner's sugar,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      2 or more squares of Baker's Chocolate,      English walnuts.    Beat the white of egg slightly, add the syrup, water, sugar as needed,  the chocolate, melted over hot water, and the vanilla, also more water  if necessary. Work with a silver plated knife and knead until thoroughly  mixed, then break off small pieces of uniform size and roll them into  balls, in the hollow of the hand, flatten the balls a little, set the  half of an English walnut upon each, pressing the nut into the candy and  thus flattening it still more. The caramel gives the chocolate a  particularly nice flavor.      HOW TO COAT CANDIES, &c., WITH BAKER'S \"DOT\" CHOCOLATE    Half a pound of \"Dot\" Chocolate will coat quite a number of candy or  other \"centers,\" but as depth of chocolate and an even temperature  during the whole time one is at work are essential, it is well, when  convenient, to melt a larger quantity of chocolate. When cold, the  unused chocolate may be cut from the dish and set aside for use at a  future time. If the chocolate be at the proper temperature when the  centers are dipped in it, it will give a rich, glossy coating free from  spots, and the candies will not have a spreading base. After a few  centers have been dipped set them in a cool place to harden. The  necessary utensils are a wire fork and a very small double boiler. The  inner dish of the boiler should be of such size that the melted  chocolate will come nearly to the top of it. Break the chocolate in  small pieces and surround with warm water, stir occasionally while  melting. When the melted chocolate has cooled to about 80 deg. F. it is  ready to use. Drop whatever is to be coated into the chocolate, with the  fork push it below the chocolate, lift out, draw across the edge of the  dish and drop onto a piece of table oil cloth or onto waxed paper. Do  not let a drop of water get into the chocolate.      CHOCOLATE DIPPED PEPPERMINTS  (Uncooked Fondant)    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE DIPPED PEPPERMINTS.]    Prepare green, white, pink and chocolate colored mints by the first  recipe. After they have dried off a little run a spatula under each and  turn to dry the other side. Coat with Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.      GINGER, CHERRY, APRICOT and NUT CHOCOLATES    [Illustration: GINGER, CHERRY, APRICOT AND NUT CHOCOLATES.]        White of 1 egg,      2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,      Sifted confectioner's sugar,      Almond or rose extract,      Preserved ginger,      Candied cherries,      Candied apricots,      Halves of almond,      Halves of pecan nuts,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Use the first four ingredients in making uncooked fondant. (Caramel  syrup is a great addition to this fondant, especially if nuts are to be  used. Use three tablespoonfuls of syrup and one tablespoonful of water  with one egg white instead of the two tablespoonfuls of water indicated  in the recipe).

It was developed, without appeal to sentiment,  under conditions which make for division  rather than co<o:>peration between employer  and employee. The men were unionists;  wages, hours, and so on, were contract matters  with the boss. Yet in an emergency, the tie  between the tunnel builder and his men was  strong enough to stand the strain of the fatiguing  and long-continued effort necessary  to complete the job and save the former from  ruin. Like incidents, on perhaps a smaller  and less dramatic scale, are not uncommon;  but the historian of business has not yet risen  to make them known.    <p 79>  _Loyalty, to Nation or Organization, shows itself  in an Emergency_    As with patriotism, business loyalty needs  some such crisis as this to evoke its expression.  In peace the patriotism of citizens is  rarely evident and is frequently called in  question. In America we sometimes assume  that it is a virtue belonging only to past  generations. But every time the honor or  integrity of the country is threatened, a multitude  of eager citizens volunteer in its defense.  Likewise, many a business man who has  come to think his workmen interested only in  the wages he pays them, discovers in his hour  of need an unsuspected asset in their devotion  to the welfare of the business, and their willingness  to make sacrifices to bring it past the  cape of storms.    Study of any field, of any single house, or  of any of the periods of depression which have  afflicted and corrected our industrial progress,  will convince one of the unfailing and genuine  loyalty of men to able and considerate em-  <p 80>  ployers. So generally true is this, indeed, that  ``house patriotism,'' ``organization spirit,'' or  ``loyalty to the management'' is accepted  by all great executives as one of the essential  elements in the day-by-day conduct of their  enterprises.    Striking exhibitions of this loyalty may wait  for an emergency. Unless it exists, however,  unless it is apparent in the daily routine, there  is immediate and relentless search for the  antagonistic condition or method, which is  robbing the force of present efficiency and  future power. Co<o:>peration of employees is  the first purpose of organization. Without  loyalty and team work the higher levels in  output, quality, and service are impossible.    _Loyalty on Part of Employer begets Loyalty in  his Workers_    The importance of loyalty in business could  not readily be overestimated, even though its  sole function were to secure united action on  the part of the officers and men. Where no  two men or groups of men were working to  <p 81>  counter purposes, but all are united in a common  purpose, the gain would be enormous, even  though the amount of energy put forth by the  individuals was not increased in the least.  When to this fact of value in organized effort  we add the accompanying psychological facts  of increased efficiency by means of loyalty,  we then begin to comprehend what it means  to have or to lack loyalty.    The amount of work accomplished by an  individual is subject to various conditions.  The whole intellect, feeling, and will must work  in unity to secure the best results. Where  there is no heart in the work (absence of  feeling) relatively little can be accomplished,  even though the intellect be convinced and the  will strained to the utmost. The employee  who lacks loyalty to his employer can at least  render but half-hearted service even though  he strive to his utmost and though he be convinced  that his financial salvation is dependent  upon efficient service. _The employer who  secures the loyalty of his men not only secures  better service, but he enables his men to accomplish_  <p 82>  _more with less effort and less exhaustion_. The  creator of loyalty is a public benefactor.    Such loyalty is always reciprocal. The  feeling which workmen entertain for their  employer is usually a reflection of his attitude  towards them. Fair wages, reasonable hours,  working quarters and conditions of average  comfort and healthfulness, and a measure of  protection against accident are now no more  than primary requirements in a factory or  store. Without them labor of the better,  more energetic types cannot be secured in the  first place or held for any length of time.  And the employer who expects, in return for  these, any more than the average of uninspired  service is sure to be disappointed.    If he treats his men like machines, looks  at them merely as cogs in the mechanism  of his affairs, they will function like machines  or find other places. If he wishes to stir  the larger, latent powers of their brains and  bodies, thereby increasing their efficiency  as thinkers and workers, he must recognize  them as men and individuals and give in  <p 83>  some measure what he asks. He must identify  them with the business, and make them  feel that they have a stake in its success and  that the organization has an interest in the  welfare of its men. The boss to whom his  employees turn in any serious perplexity or  private difficulty for advice and aid is pretty  apt to receive more than the contract minimum  of effort every day and is sure of devoted  service in any time of need.      _The Effect of Personal Relations in creating  Loyalty in a Force_    It is on this personal relationship, this platform  of mutual interests and helpfulness, that  the success and fighting strength of many one-  man houses are built. As in the contractor's  dilemma already cited, it bears fruit in the  fighting zeal, the keener interest, and the extra  speed and effort which workers bring to bear  on their individual and collective tasks. All  the knowledge and skill they possess are  thrown into the scale; their quickened intelligences  reach out for new methods and short  <p 84>  cuts; when the crisis has passed, there may be  a temporary reaction, but there is likely to be  a permanent advance both in individual efficiency  and organization spirit.    On the employer's side, this feeling is expressed  in the surrender of profits to provide  work in dull seasons; in the retention of  aged mechanics, laborers, or clerks on the  payroll after their usefulness has passed;  in pensions; in a score of neighborly and  friendly offices to those who are sick, injured,  or in trouble. A reputation for ``taking care  of his men'' has frequently been a bulwark of  defense to the small manufacturer or trader  assailed by a greedy larger rival.    Personality is, beyond doubt, the primitive  wellspring of loyalty. Most men are capable  of devotion to a worthy leader; few are  ever zealots for the sake of a cause, a principle,  a party, or a firm. All these are too abstract  to win the affection of the average man. It is  only when they become embodied in an individual,  a concrete personality which stirs our  human interest, that they become moving  <p 85>  powers. The soldiers of the Revolution fought  for Washington rather than for freedom;  Christians are loyal to Christ rather than to  his teachings; the voter cheers his candidate  and not his party; the employee is loyal to the  head of the house or his immediate foreman  and not to the generality known as the House.  Loyalty to the individuals constituting the  firm may ultimately develop into house loyalty.  To attempt to create the latter sentiment,  however, except by first creating it for  the men higher up is to go contrary to human  nature--always an unwise expenditure of  energy.      _Human Sympathy as a Factor in developing  Loyalty in Men_    In developing loyalty, human sympathy is  the greatest factor. If an executive of a  company is confident that his directors approve  his policies, appreciate his obstacles,  and are ready to back him up in any crisis,  his energy and enthusiasm for the common  object never flag. If department heads and  <p 86>  foremen are assured that the manager is  watching their efforts with attention and regard,  approving, supporting, and sparing them  wherever possible, they will anticipate orders,  assume extra burdens, and fling themselves  and their forces into any breach which may  threaten their chief's program.    If a workman, clerk, or salesman knows that  his immediate chief is interested in him personally,  that he understands what service is  being rendered and is anxious to forward his  welfare as well as that of the house, there is  no effort, inconvenience, or discomfort which  he will not undertake to complete a task which  the boss has undertaken. Throughout the  entire organization, the sympathy and co<o:>peration  of the men above with the men below  is essential for securing the highest degree of  loyalty. No assumed or manufactured sympathy,  however, will take the place of the genuine  article.    <p 87>  _Personal Relationship with Workers as Basis  for creating Loyalty_    The effectiveness of human sympathy in  creating loyalty is most apparent in one-man  businesses where the head of the house is in  personal contact with all or many of his employees.  This personal touch, however, is  not necessarily limited to the small organization.  Many men have employed thousands  and secured it. Others have succeeded in impressing  their personalities, and demonstrating  their sympathy upon large forces, though  their actual relations were with a few. The  impression made upon these and the loyalty  created in them were sufficient to permeate and  influence the entire body. Potter Palmer, the  elder Armour, Marshall Field, and Andrew Carnegie  were among the hundreds of captains  who made acquaintance with the men in the  ranks the cornerstone on which they raised  their trade or industrial citadels.    When the size of the organization precludes  personal contact, or when conditions remove  <p 88>  the executive to a distance, the task of maintaining  touch is"]]]
