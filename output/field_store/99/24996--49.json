Now to learn the meaning of  the worlds, and why mankind was made, and why discipline is worth while,  and sacrifice and pain the true law of advancement.\"    There was the shadow of a sneer in his voice, and yet something in him  shivered at the same time. He held the envelope as though weighing it in  his hand, his mind pondering many things. Then curiosity won the day,  and he suddenly tore it open with the gesture of an actor who tears open  a letter on the stage, knowing there is no real writing inside at all.    A page of finely written script in the late scientist's handwriting lay  before him. He read it through from beginning to end, missing no word,  uttering each syllable distinctly under his breath as he read.    The pallor of his face grew ghastly as he neared the end. He began to  shake all over as with ague. His breath came heavily in gasps. He still  gripped the sheet of paper, however, and deliberately, as by an intense  effort of will, read it through a second time from beginning to end. And  this time, as the last syllable dropped from his lips, the whole face of  the man flamed with a sudden and terrible anger. His skin became deep,  deep red, and he clenched his teeth. With all the strength of his  vigorous soul he was struggling to keep control of himself.    For perhaps five minutes he stood there beside the table without  stirring a muscle. He might have been carved out of stone. His eyes were  shut, and only the heaving of the chest betrayed the fact that he was a  living being. Then, with a strange quietness, he lit a match and applied  it to the sheet of paper he held in his hand. The ashes fell slowly  about him, piece by piece, and he blew them from the window-sill into  the air, his eyes following them as they floated away on the summer wind  that breathed so warmly over the world.    He turned back slowly into the room. Although his actions and movements  were absolutely steady and controlled, it was clear that he was on the  edge of violent action. A hurricane might burst upon the still room any  moment. His muscles were tense and rigid. Then, suddenly, he whitened,  collapsed, and sank backwards into a chair, like a tumbled bundle of  inert matter. He had fainted.    In less than half an hour he recovered consciousness and sat up. As  before, he made no sound. Not a syllable passed his lips. He rose  quietly and looked about the room.    Then he did a curious thing.    Taking a heavy stick from the rack in the corner he approached the  mantlepiece, and with a heavy shattering blow he smashed the clock to  pieces. The glass fell in shivering atoms.    \"Cease your lying voice for ever,\" he said, in a curiously still, even  tone. \"There is no such thing as _time_!\"    He took the watch from his pocket, swung it round several times by the  long gold chain, smashed it into smithereens against the wall with a  single blow, and then walked into his laboratory next door, and hung its  broken body on the bones of the skeleton in the corner of the room.    \"Let one damned mockery hang upon another,\" he said smiling oddly.  \"Delusions, both of you, and cruel as false!\"    He slowly moved back to the front room. He stopped opposite the bookcase  where stood in a row the \"Scriptures of the World,\" choicely bound and  exquisitely printed, the late professor's most treasured possession, and  next to them several books signed \"Pilgrim.\"    One by one he took them from the shelf and hurled them through the open  window.    \"A devil's dreams! A devil's foolish dreams!\" he cried, with a vicious  laugh.    Presently he stopped from sheer exhaustion. He turned his eyes slowly to  the wall opposite, where hung a weird array of Eastern swords and  daggers, scimitars and spears, the collections of many journeys. He  crossed the room and ran his finger along the edge. His mind seemed to  waver.    \"No,\" he muttered presently; \"not that way. There are easier and better  ways than that.\"    He took his hat and passed downstairs into the street.          5      It was five o'clock, and the June sun lay hot upon the pavement. He felt  the metal door-knob burn the palm of his hand.    \"Ah, Laidlaw, this is well met,\" cried a voice at his elbow; \"I was in  the act of coming to see you. I've a case that will interest you, and  besides, I remembered that you flavoured your tea with orange  leaves!--and I admit--\"    It was Alexis Stephen, the great hypnotic doctor.    \"I've had no tea to-day,\" Laidlaw said, in a dazed manner, after staring  for a moment as though the other had struck him in the face. A new idea  had entered his mind.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Dr. Stephen quickly. \"Something's wrong with  you. It's this sudden heat, or overwork. Come, man, let's go inside.\"    A sudden light broke upon the face of the younger man, the light of a  heaven-sent inspiration. He looked into his friend's face, and told a  direct lie.    \"Odd,\" he said, \"I myself was just coming to see you. I have something  of great importance to test your confidence with. But in _your_ house,  please,\" as Stephen urged him towards his own door--\"in your house. It's  only round the corner, and I--I cannot go back there--to my rooms--till  I have told you.    \"I'm your patient--for the moment,\" he added stammeringly as soon as  they were seated in the privacy of the hypnotist's sanctum, \"and I  want--er--\"    \"My dear Laidlaw,\" interrupted the other, in that soothing voice of  command which had suggested to many a suffering soul that the cure for  its pain lay in the powers of its own reawakened will, \"I am always at  your service, as you know. You have only to tell me what I can do for  you, and I will do it.\" He showed every desire to help him out. His  manner was indescribably tactful and direct.    Dr. Laidlaw looked up into his face.    \"I surrender my will to you,\" he said, already calmed by the other's  healing presence, \"and I want you to treat me hypnotically--and at once.  I want you to suggest to me\"--his voice became very tense--\"that I shall  forget--forget till I die--everything that has occurred to me during the  last two hours; till I die, mind,\" he added, with solemn emphasis, \"till  I die.\"    He floundered and stammered like a frightened boy. Alexis Stephen  looked at him fixedly without speaking.    \"And further,\" Laidlaw continued, \"I want you to ask me no questions. I  wish to forget for ever something I have recently discovered--something  so terrible and yet so obvious that I can hardly understand why it  is not patent to every mind in the world--for I have had a moment of  absolute _clear vision_--of merciless clairvoyance. But I want no one  else in the whole world to know what it is--least of all, old friend,  yourself.\"    He talked in utter confusion, and hardly knew what he was saying. But  the pain on his face and the anguish in his voice were an instant  passport to the other's heart.    \"Nothing is easier,\" replied Dr. Stephen, after a hesitation so slight  that the other probably did not even notice it. \"Come into my other room  where we shall not be disturbed. I can heal you. Your memory of the last  two hours shall be wiped out as though it had never been. You can trust  me absolutely.\"    \"I know I can,\" Laidlaw said simply, as he followed him in.          6      An hour later they passed back into the front room again. The sun was  already behind the houses opposite, and the shadows began to gather.    \"I went off easily?\" Laidlaw asked.    \"You were a little obstinate at first. But though you came in like a  lion, you went out like a lamb. I let you sleep a bit afterwards.\"    Dr. Stephen kept his eyes rather steadily upon his friend's face.    \"What were you doing by the fire before you came here?\" he asked,  pausing, in a casual tone, as he lit a cigarette and handed the case to  his patient.    \"I? Let me see. Oh, I know; I was worrying my way through poor old  Ebor's papers and things. I'm his executor, you know. Then I got weary  and came out for a whiff of air.\" He spoke lightly and with perfect  naturalness. Obviously he was telling the truth. \"I prefer specimens to  papers,\" he laughed cheerily.    \"I know, I know,\" said Dr. Stephen, holding a lighted match for the  cigarette. His face wore an expression of content. The experiment had  been a complete success. The memory of the last two hours was wiped out  utterly. Laidlaw was already chatting gaily and easily about a dozen  other things that interested him. Together they went out into the  street, and at his door Dr. Stephen left him with a joke and a wry face  that made his friend laugh heartily.    \"Don't dine on the professor's old papers by mistake,\" he cried, as he  vanished down the street.    Dr. Laidlaw went up to his study at the top of the house. Half way down  he met his housekeeper, Mrs. Fewings. She was flustered and excited, and  her face was very red and perspiring.    \"There've been burglars here,\" she cried excitedly, \"or something funny!  All your things is just any'ow, sir. I found everything all about  everywhere!\" She was very confused. In this orderly and very precise  establishment it was unusual to find a thing out of place.    \"Oh, my specimens!\" cried the doctor, dashing up the rest of the stairs  at top speed. \"Have they been touched or--\"    He flew to the door of the laboratory. Mrs. Fewings panted up heavily  behind him.    \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#9)"],[1,"to it by  reflection. The word mirror is more peculiarly used to signify a  smooth surface of glass, tinned and quicksilvered at the back,[3]  which reflects the images of objects placed before it.    [Footnote 3: See Chapter XII., article Mercury.]      Are they a modern invention?    The use of mirrors is very ancient; mention is made of brazen mirrors  or looking-glasses in Exodus, the 38th chapter and 8th verse. Some  modern commentators will not admit the mirrors themselves to have been  of brass, but of glass set or framed in brass; but the most learned  among the Jewish rabbins say that in those times the mirrors made use  of by the Hebrew women in dressing their heads were of metal, and that  the devout women mentioned in this passage made presents to Moses of  all their mirrors to make the brazen laver for the Tabernacle. It  might likewise be proved that the ancient Greeks made use of brazen  mirrors, from many passages in the ancient poets.         _Commentators_, explainers of passages in the Bible, &c.         _Rabbins_, doctors among the Jews, their learned men or       teachers.      What nation invented the large looking-glass plates now in use?    The French.      What city of Italy excelled all Europe for many years in the making of  fine glass?    Venice. The manufacture of fine glass was first introduced into  England by Venetian artists in 1078.      Of what is Earthenware composed?    Of clay, and those earths which are capable of being kneaded into a  paste easily receiving any form, and acquiring solidity by exposure to  fire: sand, chalk, and flint are likewise mixed with clay.      In what manner is it formed into such a variety of shapes?    The flint or sand, and soft clay, are mixed together in various  proportions for the different kinds of ware; this paste is afterwards  beaten till it becomes fit for being formed at the wheel into plates,  dishes, basins, &c. These are then put into a furnace and baked; after  which they are glazed.      What nation so greatly excelled in the manufacture of a beautiful  species of Earthenware?    The Chinese,--who, as far as can be ascertained, were its inventors.  Porcelain is a fine sort of earthenware, chiefly made in China, whence  it was called China or China-ware; it is also brought from many parts  of the East, especially from Japan, Siam, Surat, and Persia. The art  of making porcelain was one of those in which Europe had been excelled  by oriental nations; but for many years past earthenwares have been  made in different parts of Europe, so like the oriental, that they  have acquired the name of porcelain. The first European porcelains  were made in Saxony and France, and afterwards in England, Germany,  and Italy, all of which differed from those of Japan and China, but  each possessing its peculiar character. They are now brought to great  perfection in Europe, particularly in England, France and Prussia.      Before the invention of Earthenware, what supplied its place to the  early inhabitants of the world?    The more civilized the inhabitants of any country became, the more  they would perceive the convenience of possessing vessels of various  descriptions for holding or preparing their food; some of the objects  which first presented themselves would be the larger kinds of shells;  and, in hot climates, the hard coverings of the cocoa-nut or gourd. In  some cases the skins of beasts were used, as they still are in the  East, where they are sewed together, and formed into a kind of bottle  to hold milk, wine, &c.; but the people of colder climates would not  be able to avail themselves of these natural productions, and would be  obliged to make use of other substances.      What, then, would they employ?    Clay, which in many countries is found in great abundance, from its  adhesive property, and its retaining its form when dry, and becoming  insoluble in water after having been baked in the fire, would  naturally attract the attention of an improving people: from this it  arises that the early remains of culinary and other vessels which have  been discovered have been formed of this material. Among the remains  of ancient Egypt, numerous vessels have been found formed of common  clay baked in the fire; and, though of rude workmanship, extremely  elegant in form.         _Adhesive_, sticky; apt or tending to adhere.         _Insoluble_, not capable of being dissolved.         _Culinary_, belonging to cooking or domestic purposes.      Of what are Needles made?    Of steel; and though exceedingly cheap, they go through a great number  of operations before they are brought to perfection. It was in the  reign of Queen Elizabeth that the English learnt the art of making  needles.      Of what are Pins made?    Of brass wire, blanched with tin. They are manufactured in England,  France, the United States, and other countries. Though there is  scarcely any commodity cheaper than pins, there is no other which  passes through the hands of a greater number of workmen; more than  twenty persons being successively employed in the manufacture of each,  from the drawing of the brass wire to the sticking of the pin in the  paper. Pins are supposed to have been made in England about 1543, or  even earlier. Before this art was invented, the ladies made use of  wooden skewers.         _Blanched_, whitened.      Of what is Paper made?    Of linen and cotton rags beaten to a pulp in water; also from straw,  wood, and many plants.      What materials were used for writing, before the invention of Paper?    Various were the materials on which mankind in different ages and  countries contrived to write: stones, bricks, the leaves of herbs and  trees, and their rinds or barks; tablets of wood, wax, and ivory;  plates of lead, silk, linen rolls, &c. At length the Egyptian paper  made of the papyrus, was invented; then parchment; and lastly, paper  manufactured of cotton or linen rags. There are few sorts of plants  which have not at some time been used for paper and books. In Ceylon,  for instance, the leaves of the talipot; in India, the leaves of the  palm (with which they commonly covered their houses,) were used for  books. In the East Indies, the leaves of the plantain tree, dried in  the sun, were used for the same purpose. In China, paper is made of  the inner bark of the mulberry, the bamboo, the elm, the cotton, and  other trees.      What is Papyrus?    A large rush, chiefly growing in Egypt, on the banks of the Nile. The  ancient Egyptians made sails, ropes, mats, blankets, and canvas, of  the stalks and fibres of the papyrus. Their priests also wore shoes  made of it; and even sugar was extracted from this plant. Moses, the  deliverer raised by God to rescue the Israelites from the bondage of  Egypt, was exposed to the Nile in a basket of papyrus. The plant is  now, however, exceedingly scarce.      Where was the first Paper Mill erected in England?    At Dartford, by a German named Spilman, in 1588. The only sort made,  however, was the coarse brown; and it was not till 1690, when the  French protestant refugees settled in England, that their own  paper-makers began to make white writing and printing paper. The  manufacture has been brought to great perfection, both for beauty and  substance, in England and the United States.         _Protestant_, a name given in Germany to those who adhered       to the doctrines of the apostate monk, Martin Luther,       because they protested against a decree of Charles V. and       applied to a general council.         _Refugee_, from refuge, a place of safety from danger; an       asylum. Here it more particularly means those French       Protestants who quit their homes and sought other countries,       after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which deprived       them of their religious liberty.    [Illustration: THE DOME OF PISA, ITALY; WITH THE FAMOUS LEANING TOWER,  IN THE DISTANCE.]      Is it known to whom we are indebted for the invention of Linen Paper?    Not exactly. It has long been disputed among the learned when, and  by whom, it was invented; some authors say it was discovered by the  Germans, others by the Italians; others ascribe it to some refugee  Greeks at Basil, who took the idea from the making of cotton paper in  their own country; some, that the Arabs first introduced it into  Europe. Perhaps the Chinese have the best title to the invention,  inasmuch as they have for many ages made paper, and in some provinces  of the same materials as are now used by us in its manufacture.      In what place was the art of Printing first practised?    Who were the inventors of Printing, in what city, and in what year it  was begun, has long been a subject of great dispute. Mentz, Harlem,  and Strasburg, cities of Germany, all lay claim to the invention, but  Mentz seems to have the best title to it.      What was the first Book that was printed from metal types?    A copy of the Holy Scriptures, which made its appearance between the  years 1450 and 1452.      Who introduced Printing into England?    William Caxton, a merchant of London, who had acquired a knowledge of  it in his travels abroad.      Of what does Printing consist?    Of the art of taking impressions with ink, from movable characters and  figures made of metal, &c., upon paper or parchment.      What is Parchment?    Sheep or goat's skin, prepared after a peculiar manner, which renders  it proper for several uses, especially for writing on, and for the  covering of books. The ancients seem to have used the skins of animals  as a writing material, from a remote period.      From what is the word Parchment taken?    From Pergamena, the ancient name of this manufacture, which it is said  to have taken from the country of Pergamus; and to Eumenes, king of  that country, its invention is usually ascribed, though in reality,  that prince appears to have been the improver, rather than the  inventor of parchment; since"]]]
