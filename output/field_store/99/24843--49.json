This last is an exceedingly  primitive and ancient game--it must date almost as far back as jackstones  or knucklebones. I have seen the natives in Central Africa and the Indians  in the far interior of Brazil playing it in almost identical form. In  Mesopotamia the board was a log of wood sliced in two and hinged together.  In either half five or six holes were scooped out, and the game consisted  in dropping cowrie shells or pebbles into the holes. When the number in a  particular hollow came to a certain amount with the addition of the one  dropped in, you won the contents.    In most places the coffee was served in Arab fashion, not Turkish. In the  latter case it is sweet and thick and the tiny cup is half full of  grounds; in the former the coffee is clear and bitter and of unsurpassable  flavor. The diminutive cup is filled several times, but each time there is  only a mouthful poured in. Tea is served in small glasses, without milk,  but with lots of sugar. The spoons in the glasses are pierced with holes  like tea-strainers so that the tea may be stirred without spilling it.    There was in particular one booth I could never tire watching. The old man  who owned it was a vender of pickles. In rows before him were bottles and  jars and bowls containing pickles of all colors--red, yellow, green,  purple, white, and even blue. Above his head were festoons of gayly  painted peppers. He had a long gray beard, wore a green turban and a  flowing robe with a gold-braided waistcoat. In the half-lights of the  crowded, covered bazaar his was a setting in which Dulac would have  revelled.    At Museyib we led a peaceful, uneventful existence--completely shut in by  the mud. We had several bazaar rumors about proposed attacks upon the  engineers who were surveying for a railroad that was to be built to Hilleh  for the purpose of transporting the grain-crop to the capital. Nothing  materialized, however. The conditions were too poor to induce even the  easily encouraged Arabs to raid. One morning when I was wandering around  the gardens on the outskirts of the town I came across some jackals and  shot one with my Webley revolver. It was running and I fired a number of  times, and got back to town to find that my shooting had started all sorts  of excitement and reports of uprisings.    Christmas came and the different officers' messes organized celebrations.  The mess we had joined was largely Scotch, so we decided we must make a  haggis, that \"chieftain of the pudden race.\" The ingredients, save for the  whiskey, were scarcely orthodox, but if it was not a success, at least no  one admitted it.    As soon as the weather cleared we made a run to Kerbela--a lovely town,  with miles of gardens surrounding it and two great mosques. The bazaar was  particularly attractive--plentifully supplied with everything. We got  quantities of the deliciously flavored pistachio-nuts which were difficult  to obtain elsewhere, as well as all sorts of fruit and vegetables. There  were no troops stationed in the vicinity, so the prices were lower than  usual. The orders were that we should go about in armed bands, but I never  saw any marked indication of hostility. The British, true to the  remarkable tact and tolerance that contributes so largely to their success  in dealing with native races, posted Mohammedan sepoys as guards on the  mosques, and no one but Moslems could even go into the courtyards. If this  had not been done, there would have been many disturbances and uprisings,  for the Arabs and Persians felt so strongly on the question that they  regarded with marked hostility those who even gazed into the mosque  courtyards. Why it is so different in Constantinople I do not know, but  there was certainly no hostility shown us in Santa Sophia nor in the  mosque of Omar in Jerusalem. Be that as it may, forbidden fruit is always  sweet, and the Tommies were inclined to force an entrance. During a change  of guard a Tommy who had his curiosity and initiative stimulated through  recourse to arrick, the fiery liquor distilled from dates, stole into the  most holy mosque in Kerbela. By a miracle he was got out unharmed, but for  a few hours a general uprising with an attendant massacre of unbelievers  was feared.    The great mosque lost much of its dignity through an atrocious clock-tower  standing in the courtyard in front of it. It had evidently been found too  expensive to cover this tower with a golden scale to shine in the sun, so  some ingenious architect hit upon the plan of papering it with flattened  kerosene-tins. It must have glinted gloriously at first, but weather and  rain had rusted the cans and they presented but a sorry spectacle. From  the thousand and one uses to which these oil-cans have been put by the  native, one is inclined to think that the greatest benefit that has been  conferred on the natives by modern civilization is from the hands of the  Standard Oil Company.    There were a fair number of Indians living in Kerbela before the war, for  devout Shiahs are anxious to be buried near the martyred sons of Ali, and  when they are unable to move to Kerbela in their lifetime they frequently  make provisions that their remains may be transported thither. The British  found it a convenient abode for native rulers whom they were forced to  depose but still continued to pension.    [Illustration: The Lion of Babylon]    [Illustration: A dragon on the palace wall]    Hilleh, which stands near the ruins of ancient Babylon, is a modern town  very much like Museyib. I never had a chance to study the ruins at any  length. Several times we went over the part that had been excavated by the  Germans immediately before the war. I understand that this is believed to  be the great palace where Belshazzar saw the handwriting on the wall. It  is built of bricks, each one of which is stamped in cuneiform characters.  There are very fine bas-reliefs of animals, both mythical and real. In the  centre is the great stone lion, massively impressive, standing over the  prostrate form of a man. The lion has suffered from fire and man; there  have even been chips made in it recently by Arab rifles, probably not  wantonly, but in some skirmish. Standing alone in its majesty in the midst  of ruin and desolation amid the black tents of a people totally unable to  construct or even appreciate anything of a like nature, it gave one  much to think over and moralize about. The ruins of Babylon have been  excavated only in very small part; there are great isolated mounds which  have never been touched, and you can still pick up in the sand bits of  statuary, and the cylinders that were used as seal-rings. The great city  of Seleucia on the Tigris was built largely with bricks and masonry  brought by barge from the ruins of Babylon through the canal that joined  the two rivers.    The prophecy of Isaiah has fallen true:        And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees'      excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.        It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from      generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent      there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.        But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses      shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there,      and satyrs shall dance there.        And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate      houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is      near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.    A few days after Christmas, we were ordered to return to Baghdad. The  going was still bad. We had a Ford tender in advance to find and warn us  of the softest spots. Once it got into the middle of such a bottomless bog  that, after trying everything else, I hit upon the idea of rolling it out.  It was built all enclosed like a bread-van, and we turned it over and over  until we had it clear of the mud. We had hard work with the heavy  cars--sometimes we could tow one out with another, but frequently that  only resulted in getting the two stuck. Once when the cars were badly  bogged I went to a near-by Arab village to get help. I told the head man  that I wanted bundles of brush to throw in front of the cars in order to  make some sort of a foundation to pass them over. He at once started  turning out his people to aid us, but after he had got a number of loads  under way he caught sight of one of his wives, who, instead of coming to  our assistance, was washing some clothes in a copper caldron by the fire.  There followed a scene which demonstrated that even an Arab is by no means  always lord of his own household. The wife refused to budge; the Arab  railed and stormed, but she went calmly on with her washing, paying no  more attention to his fury than if he were a fractious, unreasonable  child. At length, driven to a white heat of rage, the head man upset the  caldron into the fire with his foot. The woman, without a word, got up and  stalked into a near-by hut, from which she refused to emerge. There was  nothing for her discomfited adversary to do but go on with his rounds.    By manoeuvring and digging and towing we managed to make seven miles after  fourteen hours' work that first day. Night found us close beside an Arab  village, from which I got a great bowl of buffalo milk to put into the  men's coffee. Early in the morning we were off again. The going was so  much better that we were able to make Baghdad at ten o'clock in the  evening.          IV    SKIRMISHES AND RECONNAISSANCES ALONG THE KURDISH FRONT      We spent a few days making repairs and outfitting before starting off  again. This time our destination was Deli Abbas, the headquarters of the  Thirteenth Division. The town is situated in the plains below the  foot-hills of the Persian Mountains, on the banks of the Khalis Canal,  some seventy miles "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#9)"],[1," snow.    They watched, and saw the strange lady clasp her hands together and  lean forward, and where her voice had before come to them with no  words which they could catch distinctly, they heard her say something  quite clearly in her enthusiasm: \"Eight real cowboys _here_, almost  within reach! I must see them before I sleep! I must get in touch with  them at once, and show them that I am a true friend. Come, Mrs.  Bennett! Won't you take me where they are and let me meet my boys? for  they _are_ mine in spirit; my heart goes out to them--\"    The Happy Family waited to hear no more, but went straightway back  whence they had come, and their going savored of flight.    \"Mama mine! she's coming down to the bunkhouse!\" said Weary under his  breath, and glanced back over his shoulder at the White House bulking  large in the night. \"Let's go on down to the stable and roost in the  hay a while.\"    \"She'll out-wind us, and be right there waiting when we come back,\"  objected Andy, with the wisdom gained from his brief acquaintance with  the lady. \"If she's made up her mind to call on us, there's no way  under Heaven to head her off.\"    They halted by the bunk-house door, undecided whether to go in or to  stay out in the open.    \"By golly, she don't improve _me_!\" Slim asserted pettishly. \"I hate  books like strychnine, and, by golly, she can't make me read 'em,  neither.\"    \"If there's anything I do despise it's po'try,\" groaned Cal Emmett.    \"Emerson and Browning and Shakespeare and _Gatty_,\" named Andy  gloomily.    Whereat Pink suddenly pushed open the door and went in as goes one who  knows exactly what he is about to do. They followed him distressfully  and silently. Pink went immediately to his bunk and began pulling off  his boots.    \"I'm going to bed,\" he told them. \"You fellows can stay up and  entertain her if yuh want to--_I_ won't!\"    They caught the idea and disrobed hastily, though the evening was  young. Irish blew out the lamp and dove under the blankets just as  voices came faintly from up the hill, so that when Chip rapped a  warning with his knuckles on the door, there was no sound within save  an artificial snore from the corner where lay Pink. Chip was not in  the habit of knocking before he entered, but he repeated the summons  with emphasis.    \"Who's there-e?\" drawled sleepily a voice--the voice of Weary.    \"Oh, I do believe they've retired!\" came, in a perturbed feminine  tone, to the listening ears of the Happy Family.    \"Gone to bed?\" cried Chip gravely.    \"Hours ago,\" lied Andy fluently. \"We're plumb wore out. What's  happened?\"    \"Oh, don't disturb the poor fellows! They're tired and need their  rest,\" came the perturbed tone again. After that the voices and the  footsteps went up the hill again, and the Happy Family breathed freer.  Incidentally, Pink stopped snoring and made a cigarette.    Going to bed at seven-thirty or thereabouts was not the custom of the  Happy Family, but they stayed under the covers and smoked and  discussed the situation. They dared not have a light, and the night  was longer than they had ever known a night to be, for it was late  before they slept. It was well that Miss Verbena Martin could not  overhear their talk, which was unchivalrous and unfriendly in the  extreme. The general opinion seemed to be that old maid improvers  would better stay at home where they might possibly be welcome, and  that when the Happy Family wanted improving they would let her know.  Cal Emmett said that he wouldn't mind, if they had only sent a young,  pretty one. Happy Jack prophesied plenty of trouble, and boasted that  she couldn't haul _him_ into no s'ciety. Slim declared again that by  golly, she wouldn't do no improving on _him_, and the others--Weary  and Irish and Pink and Jack Bates and Andy--discussed ways and means  and failed always to agree. When each one hoots derision at all plans  but his own, it is easy guessing what will be the result. In this  particular instance the result was voices raised in argument--voices  that reached Chip, grinning and listening on the porch of the White  House--and tardy slumber overtaking a disgruntled Happy Family on the  brink of violence.    It was not a particularly happy Family that woke to memory and a snowy  Sunday; woke late, because of the disturbing evening. When they spoke  to one another their voices were but growls, and when they trailed  through the snow to their breakfast they went in moody silence.    They had just brightened a bit before Patsy's Sunday breakfast, which  included hot-cakes and maple syrup, when the door was pushed quietly  open and the Little Doctor came in, followed closely by Miss Martin;  an apologetic Little Doctor, who seemed, by her very manner of  entering, to implore them not to blame _her_ for the intrusion. Miss  Martin was not apologetic. She was disconcertingly eager and glad to  meet them, and pathetically anxious to win their favor.    Miss Martin talked, and the Happy Family ate hurriedly and with  lowered eyelids. Miss Martin asked questions, and the Happy Family  kicked one another's shins under the table by way of urging someone to  reply; for this reason there was a quite perceptible pause between  question and answer, and the answer was invariably \"the soul of  wit\"--according to that famous recipe. Miss Martin told them naively  all about her hopes and her plans and herself, and about the distant  woman's club that took so great an interest in their welfare, and the  Happy Family listened dejectedly and tried to be polite. Also, they  did not relish the hot-cakes as usual, and Patsy had half the batter  left when the meal was over, instead of being obliged to mix more, as  was usually the case.    When they had eaten, the Happy Family filed out decorously and went  hastily down to the stables. They did not say much, but they did  glance over their shoulders uneasily once or twice.    \"The old girl is sure hot on our trail,\" Pink remarked when they were  safely through the big gate. \"She must uh got us mixed up with some  Wild West show, in her mind. Josephine!\"    \"Well, by golly, she don't improve _me_,\" Slim repeated for about the  tenth time.    The horses were all fed and everything tidy for the day, and several  saddles were being hauled down significantly from their pegs, when  Irish delivered himself of a speech, short but to the point. Irish had  been very quiet and had taken no part in the discussion that had waxed  hot all that morning.    \"Now, see here,\" he said in his decided way. \"Maybe it didn't strike  you as anything but funny--which it sure is. But yuh want to remember  that the old girl has come a dickens of a long ways to do us some  good. She's been laying awake nights thinking about how we'll get to  calling her something nice: Angel of the Roundup, maybe--you can't  tell, she's that romantic. And right here is where I'm going to give  the old girl the worth of her money. It won't hurt _us_, letting her  talk wild and foolish at us once a week, maybe; and the poor old  thing'll just be tickled to death thinking what a lot uh good she's  doing. She won't stay long, and--well, I go in. If she'll feel better  and more good to the world improving me, she's got my permission. I  guess I can stand it a while.\"    The Happy Family looked at him queerly, for if there was a black sheep  in the flock, Irish was certainly the man; and to have Irish take the  stand he did was, to say the least, unexpected.    Cal Emmett blurted the real cause of their astonishment. \"You'll have  to sign the pledge, first pass,\" he said. \"That's going to be the ante  in _her_ game. How--\"    \"Well, I don't play nobody's hand, or stake anybody's chips, but my  own,\" Irish retorted, the blood showing under the tan on his cheeks.    \"And we won't das't roll a cigarette, even, by golly!\" reminded Slim.  For Miss Martin, whether intentionally or not, had made plain to them  the platform of the new society.    Irish got some deep creases between his eyebrows, and put back his  saddle. \"You can do as yuh like,\" he said, coldly. \"I'm going to stay  and go to meeting this afternoon, according to her invite. If it's  going to make that poor old freak feel any better thinking she's a  real missionary--\" He turned and walked out of the stable without  finishing the sentence, and the Happy Family stood quite still and  watched him go.    Pink it was who first spoke. \"I ain't the boy to let any long-legged  son-of-a-gun like Irish hit a gait I can't follow,\" he dimpled, and  took the saddle reluctantly off Toots. \"If he can stand it, I guess I  can.\"    Weary loosened his latigo. \"If Cadwolloper is going to learn poetry, I  will, too,\" he grinned. \"Mama! it'll be good as a three-ringed circus!  I never thought uh that, before. I couldn't miss it.\"    \"Oh, well, if you fellows take a hand, I'll sure have to be there to  see,\" Andy decided. \"Two o'clock, did she say?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"I hate to be called a quitter,\" Pink remarked dispiritedly to the  Happy Family in general; a harassed looking Happy Family, which sat  around and said little, and watched the clock. In an hour they would  be due to attend the second meeting of the M.I.S.S.--and one would  think, from the look of them, that they were about to be hanged. \"I  hate to be called a quitter, but right here's where I lay 'em down.  The rest of yuh can go on being improved, if yuh want to--darned if I  will, though. I'm all in.\"    \"I don't recollect hearing anybody say we wanted to,\" growled Jack  Bates. \"Irish, maybe, is still burning with a desire to be nice and  chivalrous; but you can count me out. One dose is about all I can  stand.\"    \"By golly, I wouldn't go and feel that foolish again, not if yuh paid  me for it,\" Slim declared.    Irish grinned and reached for his hat. \"I done my damnettest,\" he said  cheerfully. \"I made the old girl happy once; now, one Irish Mallory is  due to have a"]]]
