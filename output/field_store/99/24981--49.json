Neither English, French, nor German, that is quite certain.  However, I am inclined to think that the commander and his companion  were born in low latitudes.  There is southern blood in them.  But I  cannot decide by their appearance whether they are Spaniards, Turks,  Arabians, or Indians.  As to their language, it is quite  incomprehensible.\"    \"There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages,\" said Conseil,  \"or the disadvantage of not having one universal language.\"    As he said these words, the door opened.  A steward entered.  He  brought us clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff I did not know.  I hastened to dress myself, and my companions followed my example.  During that time, the steward--dumb, perhaps deaf--had arranged the  table, and laid three plates.    \"This is something like!\" said Conseil.    \"Bah!\" said the angry harpooner, \"what do you suppose they eat here?  Tortoise liver, filleted shark, and beef steaks from seadogs.\"    \"We shall see,\" said Conseil.    The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and we took our  places.  Undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people, and, had it  not been for the electric light which flooded us, I could have fancied  I was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool, or at the  Grand Hotel in Paris.  I must say, however, that there was neither  bread nor wine.  The water was fresh and clear, but it was water and  did not suit Ned Land's taste.  Amongst the dishes which were brought  to us, I recognised several fish delicately dressed; but of some,  although excellent, I could give no opinion, neither could I tell to  what kingdom they belonged, whether animal or vegetable.  As to the  dinner-service, it was elegant, and in perfect taste.  Each  utensil--spoon, fork, knife, plate--had a letter engraved on it, with a  motto above it, of which this is an exact facsimile:      MOBILIS IN MOBILI N    The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical  person who commanded at the bottom of the seas.    Ned and Conseil did not reflect much.  They devoured the food, and I  did likewise.  I was, besides, reassured as to our fate; and it seemed  evident that our hosts would not let us die of want.    However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger  of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours.  Our appetites  satisfied, we felt overcome with sleep.    \"Faith!  I shall sleep well,\" said Conseil.    \"So shall I,\" replied Ned Land.    My two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet, and were  soon sound asleep.  For my own part, too many thoughts crowded my  brain, too many insoluble questions pressed upon me, too many fancies  kept my eyes half open.  Where were we?  What strange power carried us  on?  I felt--or rather fancied I felt--the machine sinking down to the  lowest beds of the sea.  Dreadful nightmares beset me; I saw in these  mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this  submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and  formidable as they.  Then my brain grew calmer, my imagination wandered  into vague unconsciousness, and I soon fell into a deep sleep.        CHAPTER IX    NED LAND'S TEMPERS    How long we slept I do not know; but our sleep must have lasted long,  for it rested us completely from our fatigues.  I woke first.  My  companions had not moved, and were still stretched in their corner.    Hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch, I felt my brain freed, my  mind clear.  I then began an attentive examination of our cell.  Nothing was changed inside.  The prison was still a prison--the  prisoners, prisoners.  However, the steward, during our sleep, had  cleared the table.  I breathed with difficulty.  The heavy air seemed  to oppress my lungs.  Although the cell was large, we had evidently  consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained.  Indeed, each  man consumes, in one hour, the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints  of air, and this air, charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of  carbonic acid, becomes unbreathable.    It became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison, and no doubt  the whole in the submarine boat.  That gave rise to a question in my  mind.  How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed?  Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen  contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by  caustic potash?  Or--a more convenient, economical, and consequently  more probable alternative--would he be satisfied to rise and take  breath at the surface of the water, like a whale, and so renew for  twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision?    In fact, I was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out  of this cell the little oxygen it contained, when suddenly I was  refreshed by a current of pure air, and perfumed with saline  emanations.  It was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine.  I  opened my mouth wide, and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh  particles.    At the same time I felt the boat rolling.  The iron-plated monster had  evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the  fashion of whales.  I found out from that the mode of ventilating the  boat.    When I had inhaled this air freely, I sought the conduit pipe, which  conveyed to us the beneficial whiff, and I was not long in finding it.  Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air  renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell.    I was making my observations, when Ned and Conseil awoke almost at the  same time, under the influence of this reviving air.  They rubbed their  eyes, stretched themselves, and were on their feet in an instant.    \"Did master sleep well?\" asked Conseil, with his usual politeness.    \"Very well, my brave boy.  And you, Mr. Land?\"    \"Soundly, Professor.  But, I don't know if I am right or not, there  seems to be a sea breeze!\"    A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had  passed during his sleep.    \"Good!\" said he.  \"That accounts for those roarings we heard, when the  supposed narwhal sighted the Abraham Lincoln.\"    \"Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath.\"    \"Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o'clock it is, unless it is  dinner-time.\"    \"Dinner-time! my good fellow?  Say rather breakfast-time, for we  certainly have begun another day.\"    \"So,\" said Conseil, \"we have slept twenty-four hours?\"    \"That is my opinion.\"    \"I will not contradict you,\" replied Ned Land.  \"But, dinner or  breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever he brings.\"    \"Master Land, we must conform to the rules on board, and I suppose our  appetites are in advance of the dinner hour.\"    \"That is just like you, friend Conseil,\" said Ned, impatiently.  \"You  are never out of temper, always calm; you would return thanks before  grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!\"    Time was getting on, and we were fearfully hungry; and this time the  steward did not appear.  It was rather too long to leave us, if they  really had good intentions towards us.  Ned Land, tormented by the  cravings of hunger, got still more angry; and, notwithstanding his  promise, I dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the  crew.    For two hours more Ned Land's temper increased; he cried, he shouted,  but in vain.  The walls were deaf.  There was no sound to be heard in  the boat; all was still as death.  It did not move, for I should have  felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw.  Plunged in the depths of the waters, it belonged no longer to earth:  this silence was dreadful.    I felt terrified, Conseil was calm, Ned Land roared.    Just then a noise was heard outside.  Steps sounded on the metal flags.  The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared.    Before I could rush forward to stop him, the Canadian had thrown him  down, and held him by the throat.  The steward was choking under the  grip of his powerful hand.    Conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooner's hand from his  half-suffocated victim, and I was going to fly to the rescue, when  suddenly I was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in French:    \"Be quiet, Master Land; and you, Professor, will you be so good as to  listen to me?\"        CHAPTER X    THE MAN OF THE SEAS    It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.    At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly.  The steward, nearly strangled,  tottered out on a sign from his master.  But such was the power of the  commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which  this man must have felt towards the Canadian.  Conseil interested in  spite of himself, I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this  scene.    The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with his arms  folded, scanned us with profound attention.  Did he hesitate to speak?  Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in French?  One might  almost think so.    After some moments of silence, which not one of us dreamed of breaking,  \"Gentlemen,\" said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, \"I speak French,  English, German, and Latin equally well.  I could, therefore, have  answered you at our first interview, but I wished to know you first,  then to reflect.  The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the  main points, convinced me of your identity.  I know now that chance has  brought before me M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at  the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad,  Conseil, his servant, and Ned Land, of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#9)"],[1," quite campodeiform in aspect.  Some of these caddis-grubs retain the campodeiform condition and do not  shelter permanently in cases, as their relations do. Different genera of  caddises differ in their mode of building. Some fasten together  fragments of water-weeds and plant refuse, others take tiny particles of  stone, of which they make firmly compacted walls, others again lay hold  of water-snail shells, which may even contain live inhabitants, and bind  these into a limy rampart behind which their bodies are in safe hiding.    The silk with which the 'caddis-worms' fasten together the materials for  their houses is produced from spinning-glands which like those of the  Lepidoptera open into the mouth.    The survey of the various types of beetle-larvae enumerated above (pp.  50-56) concluded with a short description of the _legless grub_, which  is the young form of a weevil or a bark-beetle. This is a larva in which  the head alone has its cuticle firm and hard; the rest of the body is  covered with a pale, flexible cuticle, so that the grub is often  described as 'fleshy.' This type of larva is by no means confined to  certain families of the beetles, it is frequently met with, in more or  less modified form, in two other important orders of insects, the  Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Among the Hymenoptera this is indeed the  predominant larval type. We have just seen that a caterpillar is the  usual form of larva among the saw-flies, but in all other families of  the Hymenoptera we find the legless grub. A grub of this order may  usually be distinguished from the larva of a weevil or other beetle, by  its relatively smaller head and smoother, less wrinkled cuticle; it  strikes the observer as a feebler, more helpless creature than a  beetle-grub. And it is of interest to note that this somewhat degraded  type of larva is remarkably constant through a great series of  families--gall-flies, ichneumon-flies, wasps, bees (fig. 18), ants--that  vary widely in the details of their structure and in their habits and  mode of life. Almost without exception, however, they make in some way  abundant provision for their young. The feeble, helpless, larva is in  every case well sheltered and well fed; it has not to make its own way  in the world, as the active armoured larva of a ground-beetle or the  caterpillar of a butterfly is obliged to do.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.

After Cheshire, _Bees_.]    Among those saw-flies whose larvae feed throughout life in a concealed  situation, we find an interesting transition between the caterpillar  and the legless grub. For example, the giant saw-flies (so called  'Wood-wasps') have larvae that burrow in timber, and these larvae  possess relatively large heads, somewhat flattened bodies with pointed  tail-end, and very greatly reduced legs. The feeble legless grub,  characteristic of the remaining families of the Hymenoptera, is provided  for in a well-nigh endless variety of ways. The female imago among these  insects is furnished with an elaborate and beautifully formed  ovipositor, and the act of egg-laying is usually in itself a provision  for the offspring. Gall-flies pierce plant-tissues within which their  grubs find shelter and food, the plant responding to the irritation due  to the presence of the larva by forming a characteristic growth, the  _gall_, pathological but often regular and shapely, in whose hollow  chamber the grub lives and eats. Ichneumon-flies and their allies pierce  the skin of caterpillars and other insect-larvae, laying their eggs  within the victims' bodies, which their grubs proceed to devour  internally. Some very small members of these families are content to lay  their eggs within the eggs of larger insects, thus obtaining rich  food-supply and effective protection for their tiny larvae. In  Platygaster and other genera of the family Proctotrypidae, M. Ganin  (1869) showed the occurrence of hypermetamorphosis somewhat like that  already described as occurring among the Oil-beetles (Meloidae). The  larva of Platygaster is at first rather like a small Copepod crustacean,  with prominent spiny tail-processes; after a moult this form changes  into the legless grub characteristic of the Hymenoptera, among which  larvae even approaching the campodeiform type are very exceptional. The  species of Platygaster pass their larval stages within the larvae of  gall-midges.    Wasps, bees and ants, have the ovipositor of the female modified into a  sting, which is often used for the purpose of providing food for the  helpless grubs. Thus the digging wasps (Sphegidae and Pompilidae) hunt  for caterpillars, spiders, and other creatures which they can paralyse  with their stings, and bury them alongside their eggs to furnish a  food-supply for the newly-hatched young. The social wasps and many ants  sting and kill flies and other insects, which they break up so as to  feed their grubs within the nest. It is well known that the labour of  tending the larvae in these insect societies is performed for the most  part not by the mother ('Queen') but by the modified infertile females  or 'workers.' Other ants and the bees feed their grubs (fig. 18), also  sheltered in well-constructed nests, on honey elaborated from nectar  within their own digestive canals. In all cases we see that the  helplessness of the grub is associated with some kind of parental care.    [Illustration: Fig. 19. Larva of Gall-midge (_Contarinia nasturtii_),  ventral view showing anchor process (_a_), and spiracles projecting at  sides. Magnified 30 times. From Carpenter, _Journ. Econ. Biol_, vol.  VI.]    From the Hymenoptera we may pass on to the Diptera or Two-winged Flies,  an order of which the vast number of species and in many cases the  myriads of individuals force themselves on the observer's notice. F.  Brauer (1863) divided the Diptera into two sub-orders[8]; of the first  of these a Crane-fly or 'Daddy-long-legs' may be taken as typical, of  the second an ordinary House-fly or Bluebottle. All the larvae of the  Diptera are legless, those of the Crane-fly group have well-developed  hard heads, with biting mandibles, but in the House-fly section the  larva is of the degraded _vermiculiform_ type known as the _maggot_,  not only legless, but without a definite head, the front end of the  creature usually tapering to the mouth, where there are a pair of strong  hooks, used for tearing up the food. A few examples of each of these  types must suffice in the present brief survey. A few pages back (p. 66)  reference was made to the production of galls on various plants, through  the activity of larvae of the hymenopterous family Cynipidae. Many  plant-galls are due, however, to the presence of grubs of tiny dipterous  insects, the Cecidomyidae or Gall-midges. A cecid grub (fig. 19) has an  elongate body with flexible, wrinkled cuticle, tapering somewhat at the  two ends. The head, if rather narrow, is distinct, and beneath the  prothorax is a characteristic sclerite known as the 'anchor process' or  'breast bone.' Along either side of the body is a series of paired  spiracles, each usually situated at the tip of a little tubular  outgrowth of the cuticle; the hindmost spiracles are often larger than  the others. These little grubs live in family communities, their  presence leading to some deformation of the plant that serves to shelter  them. A shrivelled fruit or an arrested and swollen shoot, such as may  be due respectively to the Pear-midge (_Diplosis pyrivora_) or the  Osier-midge (_Rhabdophaga heterobia_), is a frequent result of the  irritation set up by these little grubs. In a larva of the crane-fly  family (Tipulidae, fig. 20) living underground and eating plant-roots,  like the well-known 'leather-jacket' grubs of the large  'Daddy-long-legs' (Tipula) or burrowing into a rotting turnip or swollen  fungus, like the more slender grub of a 'Winter Gnat' (Trichocera), the  student notices a somewhat tough cuticle, a relatively small but  distinct head, and frequently prominent finger-like processes on the  tail-segment. Further examination shows a striking modification in the  arrangement of the spiracles. Instead of a paired series on most of the  body-segments, as in caterpillars and the vast majority of insects  whether larval or adult, there are two large spiracles surrounded by the  prominent tail-processes, and a pair of very small ones on the  prothorax, the latter possibly closed up and useless. This restriction  of the breathing-holes to a front and hind pair (amphipneustic  condition) or to a hind pair only (metapneustic type) is highly  characteristic of the larvae of Two-winged flies.    [8] Known as the Orthorrhapha and the Cyclorrhapha; these terms are  derived from the manner in which the larval or pupal cuticle splits, as  will be explained in the next chapter (p. 88).

The Bluebottle's eggs, the well-known 'fly blow' laid in summer  time on exposed meat, not unnaturally arouse feelings of disgust, yet  they are the prelude to one of the most marvellous of all insect  life-stories.
