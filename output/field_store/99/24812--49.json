The deep water is in the channels made by the  tides, setting in and out of the different arms; and the best information  I can give of them, will be found by referring to the plan. The broadest  of these channels is about two miles wide, on the east side of the bay;  and our anchorage there near Sea Hill, just within the entrance, seems to  be the best for a ship purposing to make but a short stay. Wood is easily  procured; and fresh water was found in small ponds and swamps, at a  little distance behind the beach. This is also the best, if not the sole  place in the bay for hauling the seine; and a fresh meal of good fish was  there several times procured for all the ship's company.    The country round Keppel Bay mostly consists either of stony hills, or of  very low land covered with salt swamps and mangroves. Almost all the  borders of the bay, and of the several arms into which it branches, are  of this latter description; so that there are few places where it was not  necessary to wade some distance in soft mud, and afterwards to cut  through a barrier of mangroves, before reaching the solid land.    Mention has been made of the ridge of hills by which the low land on the  south side of the bay is bounded. The upper parts of it are steep and  rocky, and may be a thousand, or perhaps fifteen hundred feet high, but  the lower sloping sides are covered with wood; Mount Larcom and the hills  within the ridge, are clothed with trees nearly to the top; yet the  aspect of the whole is sterile. The high land near the western arm,  though stony and shallow in soil, is covered with grass, and trees of  moderate growth; but the best part of the country was that near Cape  Keppel; hill and valley are there well proportioned, the grass is of a  better kind and more abundant, the trees are thinly scattered, and there  is very little underwood. The lowest parts are not mangrove swamps, as  elsewhere, but pleasant looking vallies, at the bottom of which are ponds  of fresh water frequented by flocks of ducks. Cattle would find here a  tolerable abundance of nutritive food, though the soil may perhaps be no  where sufficiently deep and good to afford a productive return to the  husbandman.    After the mangrove, the most common trees round Keppel Bay are different  kinds of _eucalyptus_, fit for the ordinary purposes of building. A  species of _Cycas_, described by captain Cook (Hawkesworth, III. 220,  221) as a third kind of palm found by him on this coast, and bearing  poisonous nuts, was not scarce in the neighbourhood of West-arm Hill. We  found three kinds of stone here: a greyish slate, quartz and various  granitic combinations, and a soft, whitish stone, saponaceous to the  touch; the two first were often found intermixed, and the last generally,  if not always lying above them. The quartz was of various colours, and  sometimes pure; but never in a state of crystallisation.    Wherever we landed there had been Indians; but it was near the ship only,  that any of them made their appearance. They were described by the  gentlemen who saw them, as stout, muscular men, who seemed to understand  bartering better than most, or perhaps any people we had hitherto seen in  this country. Upon the outer bone of the wrist they had the same hard  tumour as the people of Hervey's Bay, and the cause of it was attempted,  ineffectually, to be explained to one of the gentlemen; but as cast nets  were seen in the neighbourhood, there seems little doubt that the manner  of throwing them produces the tumours. These people were not devoid of  curiosity; but several things which might have been supposed most likely  to excite it, passed without notice. Of their dispositions we had every  reason to speak highly, from their conduct to our sailors; but  particularly to the master's mate and seaman who had lost themselves, and  were absolutely in their power. On the morning we quitted the bay, a  large party was again seen, coming down to the usual place; which seemed  to imply that our conduct and presents had conciliated their good will,  and that they would be glad to have communication with another vessel.    It is scarcely necessary to say, that these people are almost black, and  go entirely naked, since none of any other colour, or regularly wearing  clothes, have been seen in any part of Terra Australis. About their fire  places were usually scattered the shells of large crabs, the bones of  turtle, and the remains of a parsnip-like root, apparently of fern; and  once the bones of a porpoise were found; besides these, they doubtless  procure fish, and wild ducks were seen in their possession. There are  kangaroos in the woods, and several bustards were seen near Cape Keppel.  The mud banks are frequented by curlews, gulls, and some lesser birds.  Oysters of a small, crumply kind, are tolerably plentiful; they do not  adhere to the rocks, but stick to each other in large masses on the  banks; here are also pearl oysters, but not so abundantly as in Port  Curtis.    The _latitude_ of our anchorage, from the mean of three meridian  altitudes to the north, was      23 deg. 29' 34\" south.    _Longitude_ from twenty-four sets of distances of the sun and moon, the  particulars of which are given in Table I. of Appendix No. I. to this  volume, 151 deg. 0' 28\"; but from fifty other sets, reduced by the survey  from Broad Sound, the better longitude of the anchorage is 150 deg. 58' 20\"  east.    According to the time keepers the longitude would be 150 deg. 57' 43\"; and in  an interval of six days, they were found to err no more than 5\" of  longitude on the Port-Jackson rates.    From three compasses on the binnacle, lieutenant Flinders observed the  _variation_ 6 deg. 48', when the ship's head was north, and 5 deg. 47' when it  was south-south-east. This last being reduced to the meridian, the mean  of both will be 6 deg. 47' east, nearly the same as in Bustard Bay; but 2 deg.  less than was observed off Gatcombe Head. At the different stations round  Keppel Bay whence bearings were taken, the variation differed from 5 deg. 10'  to 6 deg. 30' east.    Whilst beating off the entrance, I had 7 deg. 52' east variation, from  azimuths with the surveying compass when the head was N. W., and from an  amplitude, with the head N. by W., 6 deg. 54'; the mean reduced to the  meridian. will be for the outside of the bay 6 deg. 16' east.    Captain Cook had 7 deg. 24' near the same situation, from amplitudes and  azimuths observed in 1770, with the Endeavour's head W. N. W.    The rise of _tide_ in the entrance of Keppel Bay seems to vary at the  neaps and springs, from nine to fourteen feet, and high water to take  place _nine hours and a half_ after the moon's passage over and under the  meridian; but the morning's tide fell two or three feet short of that at  night. The set past the ship was greatest at the last quarter of the  flood and first of the ebb, when it ran two-and-half knots, and turned  very suddenly. In the offing, the flood came from the eastward, at the  rate of one mile per hour.    CHAPTER II.    The Keppel Isles, and coast to Cape Manifold.  A new port discovered and examined.

FROM KEPPEL BAY.]    AUGUST 1802    The rocks and islands lying off Keppel Bay to the northward, are numerous  and scattered without order; two of them are of greater magnitude than  the rest, and captain Cook had attempted to pass between these and the  main land, from which they are distant about five miles; but shoal water  obliged him to desist. When we got under way in the morning of the 18th  [WEDNESDAY 18 AUGUST 1802], our course was directed for the outside of  these two islands, and we passed within a mile of them in 9, and from  that to 13 fathoms water. They are five miles asunder, and the  southernmost and largest is near twelve in circumference; its rocky hills  are partly covered with grass and wood, and the gullies down the sides,  as also the natives seen upon the island, implied that fresh water was to  be had there.    [EAST COAST. CAPE MANIFOLD.]    At the back of the islands the main coast is low and sandy, with the  exception of two or three rocky heads; but at a few miles inland there is  a chain of hills, moderately elevated and not ill clothed with wood.  These hills are a continuation of the same which I had ascended on the  west side of Keppel Bay, and extend as far as the two peaks behind Cape  Manifold.    After passing the Keppel Isles we steered for a small opening in the  coast, seven or eight miles to the north-west, and the Lady Nelson was  directed to lead in; but on her making the signal for 3 fathoms, and the  inlet appearing to be a sandy cove fit only for boats, we kept on  northward, between one and two miles from the shore. At five o'clock, the  south-east breeze died away, and a descent of the mercury announcing  either little wind for the night or a breeze off the land, a kedge anchor  was dropped in 8 fathoms, sandy bottom. The bearings then taken were,    Keppel Isles, the first lump,                S. 45 deg. E.  C. Manifold, east end of the island near it, N.  9  E.  Peaked islet in the offing,                  N. 281/2 E.  Flat islet, distant four or five leagues,    N. 43  E.    The two last are called the Brothers., in captain Cook's chart; though  described in the voyage as being, one \"low and flat, and the other high  and round.\" A perforation in the higher islet admits the light entirely  through it, and is distinguishable when it bears nearly south-east.    THURSDAY 19 AUGUST 1802    At seven next morning, having then a light air from the land with foggy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#9)"],[1,"ty, being the colour worn by that race for  mourning. The shape of a mhembur is a flight of steps with a flat top,  without any railing or enclosed place; the reader, in his recitings,  occasionally sitting on the steps, or standing, as may be most convenient  to himself.    On the walls of the Emaum-baarah, mirrors and looking-glasses are fixed in  suitable situations to give effect to the brilliant display of light, from  the magnificent chandeliers suspended from the cupola and cornices. The  nobles and the wealthy are excited with a desire to emulate each other in  the splendour of their display on these occasions;--all the mirrors, glass,  lustres, chandeliers, &c. are brought together to this place, from their  several stations in the mansion; and it is due to them to admit the effect  to be often imposingly grand, and the blaze of light splendid. I have  frequently been reminded in these scenes of the visionary castles conjured  to the imagination, whilst reading 'The Arabian Nights' Entertainments'.    On each side the Tazia--the whole length of the wall--banners are ranged,  in great variety of colour and fabric; some of them are costly and  splendid. I have seen many constructed of the richest embroidery, on silk  grounds, of gold and silver, with massy gold fringes, cords, and tassels;  the staff is cased with gold or silver, worked into figures of birds and  other animals, in every variety; the top of which has a crest, in some a  spread hand,[12] in others a sort of plume, and not unfrequently a crest  resembling a grenade, formed of the precious metals, and set with stones  of great value.    On the base of the Tazia the several articles are placed conceived likely  to have been used by Hosein at Kraabaallah; a turban of gold or silver  tissue, a splendid sword and belt, the handle and hilt set with precious  stones, a shield, the Arabian bow and arrows. These ancient emblems of  royalty are indispensable in order to do honour to Hosein, in the view  they take of his sovereign right to be the head or leader of the true  Mussulmauns. Wax lights, red and green, are also placed in great numbers  about its base, in silver or glass candlesticks; and censers of gold and  silver, burning incense perpetually during Mahurrum. Many other minor  tributes to the Emaums are discovered near the Tazia, as choice fruits and  garlands of sweet-scented flowers, the offerings of ladies of the family  to their relative's Tazia.    Amongst the poorer classes of the people an equal proportion of zealous  spirit is evinced; and according to their several abilities, so they  commemorate the period, interesting alike to all. Those who cannot compass  the real splendour of an Emaum-baarah, are satisfied with an imitative one  in the best hall their habitation affords; and, where mirrors and  chandeliers are not available, they are content to do honour to the Emaums  with lamps of uberuck, which in truth are pleasing substitutes at a small  price: these lamps are made in a variety of pretty shapes, curiously  painted, and ingeniously ornamented with cut paper; they burn oil in them,  and, when well arranged, and diversified with their wonted taste, produce  a good light, and pleasing effect.    The banners of Hosein, in the houses of the poor, are formed of materials  according to their humble means, from tinsel imitations down to dyed  muslin; and a similar difference is to be perceived in their selection of  the metal of which their crests are made.    Mourning assemblies are held in the Emaum-baarahs twice every day during  Mahurrum; those of the evening, however, are the most attractive, and have  the fullest attendance of visitors. The master of the house, at the  appointed hour, takes his seat on the floor near the pulpit, surrounded by  the males of his family and intimate friends, and the crowd of strangers  arrange themselves--wherever there is sitting room--without impeding the  view of the Tazia.    One of the most popular Maulvees[13] of the age is engaged to recite the  particular portion appointed for each day, from the manuscript documents,  called Dhie Mudgelluss,[14] in the Persian language. This work is in ten  parts and contains a subject for each day's service, descriptive of the  life and sufferings of the Emaums, their friends, and children,  particularly as regards the eventful period of Mahurrum in which they were  engaged. It is, I am assured, a pathetic, fine composition, and a faithful  narrative of each particular circumstance in the history of their leaders,  the heroic bravery of their friends, &c. They are particularly anxious to  engage an eloquent reader for this part of the performance, who by his  impressive manner compels his hearers to sympathise in the affecting  incidents which are recited by him.    I have been present when the effect produced by the superior oratory and  gestures of a Maulvee has almost terrified me, the profound grief, evinced  in his tears and groans, being piercing and apparently sincere. I have  even witnessed blood issuing from the breast of sturdy men, who beat  themselves simultaneously as they ejaculated the names 'Hasan!'  'Hosein!'[15] for ten minutes, and occasionally during a longer period, in  that part of the service called Mortem.[16]    The portion of Dhie Mudgelluss concluded, sherbet is handed round to the  assembly; and as they voluntarily abstain from luxuries at this season, a  substitute for pawn[17]--the green leaf in general use amongst the  natives--has been introduced, consisting of dried coffee, cocoa-nut shreds,  betel-nut, cardimuns,[18] dunyah,[19] and a proportionate quantity of  tobacco-leaf and lime; these are mixed together and handed to the  visitors, on small silver trays. The hookha[20] is introduced to the  superiors of the assembly; you are perhaps aware that inferiors do not  smoke in the presence of superiors without their command or permission.    This ceremony terminated, the Murseeah[21] is chanted, by several  well-practised voices, with good effect. This part of the service is,  perhaps, the most impressive, as the very ignorant, even, can comprehend  every word,--the Murseeah being in the Hindoostanic tongue, a poetical  composition of great merit, and embracing all the subjects they meet to  commemorate. The whole assembly rise up afterwards, and, as with one voice,  recount the names of the lawful leaders after Mahumud, entreating  blessings and peace to their souls. They then repeat the names of the  hated usurpers (Caliphas), on whose memory they invoke curses, &c. Mortem  follows, beating of breasts in unison with the voices, and uttering the  names of Hasan and Hosein; this performance concludes each day's  Mudgelluss, either of the morning or evening.    The ladies celebrate the returning season of Mahurrum with as much spirit  and zeal as the confinement, in which they exist, can possibly admit of.  There are but few, and those chiefly princesses, who have Emaum-baarahs at  command, within the boundary of the zeenahnah; the largest and best  apartment in their establishment is therefore selected for the purpose of  an Emaum-baarah, into which none but females are admitted, excepting the  husband, father, son, or brother, of the lady; who having, on this  occasion, full liberty to invite her female acquaintance, those who are  her nearest male relatives even are not admitted until previous notice is  given, in order that the female guests may secrete themselves from the  sight of these relatives of their hostess.    In commemorating this remarkable event in Mussulmaun history, the  expressions of grief, manifested by the ladies, are far greater, and  appear to me more lasting than with the other sex; indeed, I never could  have given credit to the extent of their bewailings, without witnessing,  as I have done for many years, the season for tears and profound grief  return with the month of Mahurrum. In sorrowing for the martyred Emaums,  they seem to forget their private griefs; the bereavement of a beloved  object even is almost overlooked in the dutiful remembrance of Hasan and  Hosein at this period; and I have had opportunities of observing this  triumph of religious feeling in women, who are remarkable for their  affectionate attachment to their children, husbands, and parents;--they  tell me, 'We must not indulge selfish sorrows of our own, whilst the  Prophet's family alone have a right to our tears'.    The religious zeal of these people is evinced, likewise, in a stern,  systematic, line of privations, during the period of Mahurrum; no one is  obliged by any law or command; it is voluntary abstinence on the part of  each individual--they impose it on themselves, out of pure pity and  respect for their Emaums' well-remembered sufferings. Every thing which  constitutes comfort, luxury, or even convenience at other times, on these  occasions are rigidly laid aside. The pallungh and the charpoy[22] (the  two descriptions of bedsteads in general use), on which the females love  to lounge for some hours in the day and night, are removed from their  standings, and, in lieu of this comfort, they take their rest on a common  date mat, on the floor. The musnud,[23] and all its cushioned luxuries,  give place, on this occasion, to the simply matted floor. The indulgence  in choice dainties, at other times so necessary to their happiness, is now  foregone, and their meal limited, throughout Mahurrum, to the coarsest  food--such as barley bread, rice and peas boiled together (called  kutcher),[24] without even the usual additions to make it palatable  ketcherie,[25] as ghee, salt, pepper, and spices; these ingredients being  considered by the zealous females too indulgent and luxurious for humble  mourners during Muhurrum.    The pawn leaf, another luxury of no small moment to Asiatic tastes, is now  banished for the ten days' mourning. A very poor substitute has been  adopted, in the mixture described at the"]]]
