[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#9)"],[1," East River and across to the  flare of Brooklyn; to the left the whole arc of the Fifty-ninth Street  Bridge was exposed. In front the windows overlooked Beekman Place  and were directly opposite, the front of the house to which the taxi  driver had gone that afternoon.    Here they took up the vigil. For four hours one of the two sat with  eyes never moving from the street and the windows of the house across  the street; and then he left the post, and the other took it.    It was vastly wearying work. Very few vehicles came into the light of  the street lamp beneath them, and every person who dismounted from one  of them had to be scrutinized with painful diligence.    Once a girl, young and slender and sprightly, stepped out of a taxi,  about ten o'clock at night, and ran lightly up the steps of the house.  Ronicky caught his friend by the shoulders and dragged him to the  window. \"There she is now!\" he exclaimed.    But the eye of the lover, even though the girl was in a dim light,  could not he deceived. The moment he caught her profile, as she turned  in opening the door, Bill Gregg shook his head. \"That's not the one.  She's all different, a pile different, Ronicky.\"    Ronicky sighed. \"I thought we had her,\" he said. \"Go on back to sleep.  I'll call you again if anything happens.\"    But nothing more happened that night, though even in the dull, ghost  hours of the early morning they did not relax their vigil. But all the  next day there was still no sign of Caroline Smith in the house across  the street; no face like hers ever appeared at the windows. Apparently  the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality. Not a  sign of Caroline Smith appeared even during the second day. By this  time the nerves of the two watchers were shattered by the constant  strain, and the monotonous view from the front window was beginning to  madden them.    \"It's proof that she ain't yonder,\" said Bill Gregg. \"Here's two days  gone, and not a sign of her yet. It sure means that she ain't in that  house, unless she's sick in bed.\" And he grew pale at the thought.    \"Partner,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"if they are trying to keep her away  from us they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long  as two days. Ain't that right? It looks pretty bad for us, but I'm  staying here for one solid week, anyway. It's just about our last  chance, Bill. We've done our hunting pretty near as well as we could.  If we don't land her this trip, I'm about ready to give up.\"    Bill Gregg sadly agreed that this was their last chance and they must  play it to the limit. One week was decided on as a fair test. If, at  the end of that time, Caroline Smith did not come out of the house  across the street they could conclude that she did not stay there. And  then there would be nothing for it but to take the first train back  West.    The third day passed and the fourth, dreary, dreary days of  unfaltering vigilance on the part of the two watchers. And on the  fifth morning even Ronicky Doone sat with his head in his hands at  the window, peering through the slit between the drawn curtains which  sheltered him from being observed at his spying. When he called out  softly, the sound brought Gregg, with one long leap out of the chair  where he was sleeping, to the window. There could be no shadow of a  doubt about it. There stood Caroline Smith in the door of the house!    She closed the door behind her and, walking to the top of the steps,  paused there and looked up and down the street.    Bill Gregg groaned, snatched his hat and plunged through the door, and  Ronicky heard the brief thunder of his feet down the first flight of  stairs, then the heavy thumps, as he raced around the landing. He was  able to trace him down all the three flights of steps to the bottom.    And so swift was that descent that, when the girl, idling down the  steps across the street, came onto the sidewalk, Bill Gregg rushed out  from the other side and ran toward her.    They made a strange picture as they came to a halt at the same  instant, the girl shrinking back in apparent fear of the man, and Bill  Gregg stopping by that same show of fear, as though by a blow in the  face. There was such a contrast between the two figures that Ronicky  Doone might have laughed, had he not been shaking his head with  sympathy for Bill Gregg.    For never had the miner seemed so clumsily big and gaunt, never had  his clothes seemed so unpressed and shapeless, while his soft gray  hat, to which he still clung religiously, appeared hopelessly out of  place in contrast with the slim prettiness of the girl. She wore a  black straw hat, turned back from her face, with a single big red  flower at the side of it; her dress was a tailored gray tweed. The  same distinction between their clothes was in their faces, the finely  modeled prettiness of her features and the big, careless chiseling of  the features of Bill Gregg.    Ronicky Doone did not wonder that, after her first fear, her gesture  was one of disdain and surprise.    Bill Gregg had dragged the hat from his head, and the wind lifted his  long black hair and made it wild. He went a long, slow step closer to  her, with both his hands outstretched.    A strange scene for a street, and Ronicky Doone saw the girl flash a  glance over her shoulder and back to the house from which she had just  come. Ronicky Doone followed that glance, and he saw, all hidden save  the profile of the face, a man standing at an opposite window and  smiling scornfully down at that picture in the street.    What a face it was! Never in his life had Ronicky Doone seen a man  who, in one instant, filled him with such fear and hatred, such  loathing and such dread, such scorn and such terror. The nose was  hooked like the nose of a bird of prey; the eyes were long and  slanting like those of an Oriental. The face was thin, almost  fleshless, so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a  death's-head.    As for the girl, the sight of that onlooker seemed to fill her with a  new terror. She shrank back from Bill Gregg until her shoulders were  almost pressed against the wall of the house. And Ronicky saw her head  shake, as she denied Bill the right of advancing farther. Still he  pleaded, and still she ordered him away. Finally Bill Gregg drew  himself up and bowed to her and turned on his heel.    The girl hesitated a moment. It seemed to Ronicky, in spite of the  fact that she had just driven Bill Gregg away, as if she were on  the verge of following him to bring him back. For she made a slight  outward gesture with one hand.    If this were in her mind, however, it vanished instantly. She turned  with a shudder and hurried away down the street.    As for Bill Gregg he bore himself straight as a soldier and came back  across the pavement, but it was the erectness of a soldier who has met  with a crushing defeat and only preserves an outward resolution, while  all the spirit within is crushed.    Ronicky Doone turned gloomily away from the window and listened to the  progress of Gregg up the stairs. What a contrast between the ascent  and the descent! He had literally flown down. Now his heels clumped  out a slow and regular death march, as he came back to the room.    When Gregg opened the door Ronicky Doone blinked and drew in a deep  breath at the sight of the poor fellow's face. Gregg had known before  that he truly loved this girl whom he had never seen, but he had never  dreamed what the strength of that love was. Now, in the very moment of  seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood, he had lost  her, and there was something like death in the face of the big miner  as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair.    After that he did not move so much as a finger from the position into  which he had fallen limply. His legs were twisted awkwardly, sprawling  across the floor in front of him; one long arm dragged down toward the  floor, as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the  labor-hardened hands; his chin was fallen against his breast.    When Ronicky Doone crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder  he did not look up. \"It's ended,\" said Bill Gregg faintly. \"Now we  hit the back trail and forget all about this.\" He added with a faint  attempt at cynicism: \"I've just wasted a pile of good money-making  time from the mine, that's all.\"    \"H'm!\" said Ronicky Doone. \"Bill, look me in the eye and tell me, man  to man, that you're a liar!\" He added: \"Can you ever be happy without  her, man?\"    The cruelty of that speech made Gregg flush and look up sharply. This  was exactly what Ronicky Doone wanted.    \"I guess they ain't any use talking about that part of it,\" said Gregg  huskily.    \"Ain't there? That's where you and me don't agree! Why, Bill, look at  the way things have gone! You start out with a photograph of a girl.  Now you've followed her, found her name, tracked her clear across the  continent and know her street address, and you've given her a chance  to see your own face. Ain't that something done? After you've done all  that are you going to give up now? Not you, Bill! You're going to buck  up and go ahead full steam. Eh?\"    Bill Gregg smiled sourly. \"D'you know what she said when I come  rushing up and saying: 'I'm Bill Gregg!' D'you know what she said?\"    \"Well?\"    \"'Bill Gregg?' she says. 'I don't remember any such name!'    \"That took the wind out of me. I only had enough left to say: 'The  gent that was writing those papers to the correspondence school to you  from the West, the one you sent your picture to and--'    \"'Sent my picture to!' she says and looks as if the ground had opened  under her feet. 'You're mad!' she says. And then she looks back over  her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house!\"    \"D'you know why she looked back over her shoulder?\"    \"Just for the reason I told you.\"    \"No, Bill.

The commonly received belief is that a goose forming part  of the royal dinner when the news was brought to Queen Elizabeth of  the defeat of the Spanish Armada, her chivalrous majesty commanded  that the dish (a goose) then before her, might be served up on every  29th of September, to commemorate the above glorious event. Mr. Douce,  the learned antiquarian illustrator, saw the above reason \"somewhere\"  (such is his expression); but Mr. Brand thinks this rather to be a  stronger proof that the custom prevailed at court in Queen Elizabeth's  time. Its origin, however, is referable to the previous century:  since, bringing a goose \"fit for the lord's dinner,\" on this day  appears to have been customary even in the time of Edward IV.; and,  that it was common before the Armada victory, is shown the following  passage in Gascoigne, who died in 1577, or eleven years before the  above event:--      \"And when the tenauntes come to pay their quarter's rent,    They bring some fowle at Midsummer, a dish of fish at Lent;    At Christmasse a capon, _at Michaelmas a goose_,    And somewhat else at New Yere's-tide, _for feare their leave flies      loose_.\"    The reason given by Blount, in his _Tenures_, is considered far from  satisfactory. Beckwith, his editor, says, \"Probably no other reason  can be given for this custom, but that Michaelmas Day was a great  festival, and geese at that time were most plentiful.\" The origin of  the saying that \"if you eat goose on Michaelmas Day, you will never  want money all the year round,\" is explained, in the _British Apollo_,  as follows:--      The custom came up from the tenants presenting    Their landlords with geese to incline their relenting    On following payments.    Again:--      For doubtless 'twas at first design'd    To make the people seasons mind,    That so they might apply their care    To all those things which needful were;    And by a good industrious hand,    Know when and how t' improve their land.    Ellis, in his notes to Brand, says, \"the practice of eating goose on  Michaelmas Day does not appear to prevail in any part of France. Upon  St. Martin's Day, they eat turkey at Paris. They likewise eat geese  upon St. Martin's Day, Twelfth Day, and Shrove Tuesday, at Paris.\"  In Denmark, where the harvest is later than here, every family has a  roasted goose for supper on St. Martin's Eve.
