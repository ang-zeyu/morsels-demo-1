The primitive force we are in danger of losing depends much on line, and  no work that aims at a sublime impression can dispense with the basis of  a carefully wrought and simple line scheme.    The study, therefore, of pure line drawing is of great importance to the  painter, and the numerous drawings that exist by the great masters in  this method show how much they understood its value.    And the revival of line drawing, and the desire there is to find a  simpler convention founded on this basis, are among the most hopeful  signs in the art of the moment.          V    MASS DRAWING      In the preceding chapter it has, I hope, been shown that outline drawing  is an instinct with Western artists and has been so from the earliest  times; that this instinct is due to the fact that the first mental idea  of an object is the sense of its form as a felt thing, not a thing seen;  and that an outline drawing satisfies and appeals directly to this  mental idea of objects.    But there is another basis of expression directly related to visual  appearances that in the fulness of time was evolved, and has had a very  great influence on modern art. This form of drawing is based on the  consideration of the flat appearances on the retina, with the knowledge  of the felt shapes of objects for the time being forgotten. In  opposition to line drawing, we may call this Mass Drawing.    The scientific truth of this point of view is obvious. If only the  accurate copying of the appearances of nature were the sole object of  art (an idea to be met with among students) the problem of painting  would be simpler than it is, and would be likely ere long to be solved  by the photographic camera.    This form of drawing is the natural means of expression when a brush  full of paint is in your hands. The reducing of a complicated appearance  to a few simple masses is the first necessity of the painter. But  this will be fully explained in a later chapter treating more  practically of the practice of mass drawing.    [Illustration: Plate X.    EXAMPLE OF FIFTEENTH-CENTURY CHINESE WORK BY LUI LIANG (BRITISH MUSEUM)    Showing how early Chinese masters had developed the mass-drawing point  of view.]    The art of China and Japan appears to have been more [influenced by this  view of natural appearances than that of the West has been, until quite  lately. The Eastern mind does not seem to be so obsessed by the  objectivity of things as is the Western mind. With us the practical  sense of touch is all powerful. \"I know that is so, because I felt it  with my hands\" would be a characteristic expression with us. Whereas I  do not think it would be an expression the Eastern mind would use. With  them the spiritual essence of the thing seen appears to be the more  real, judging from their art. And who is to say they may not be right?  This is certainly the impression one gets from their beautiful painting,  with its lightness of texture and avoidance of solidity. It is founded  on nature regarded as a flat vision, instead of a collection of solids  in space. Their use of line is also much more restrained than with us,  and it is seldom used to accentuate the solidity of things, but chiefly  to support the boundaries of masses and suggest detail. Light and shade,  which suggest solidity, are never used, a wide light where there is no  shadow pervades everything, their drawing being done with the brush in  masses.    When, as in the time of Titian, the art of the West had discovered light  and shade, linear perspective, aerial perspective, &c., and had begun by  fusing the edges of the masses to suspect the necessity of painting to a  widely diffused focus, they had got very near considering appearances  as a visual whole. But it was not until Velazquez that a picture was  painted that was founded entirely on visual appearances, in which a  basis of objective outlines was discarded and replaced by a structure of  tone masses.    When he took his own painting room with the little Infanta and her maids  as a subject, Velazquez seems to have considered it entirely as one flat  visual impression. The focal attention is centred on the Infanta, with  the figures on either side more or less out of focus, those on the  extreme right being quite blurred. The reproduction here given  unfortunately does not show these subtleties, and flattens the general  appearance very much. The focus is nowhere sharp, as this would disturb  the contemplation of the large visual impression. And there, I think,  for the first time, the whole gamut of natural vision, tone, colour,  form, light and shade, atmosphere, focus, &c., considered as one  impression, were put on canvas.    All sense of design is lost. The picture has no surface; it is all  atmosphere between the four edges of the frame, and the objects are  within. Placed as it is in the Prado, with the light coming from the  right as in the picture, there is no break between the real people  before it and the figures within, except the slight yellow veil due to  age.    But wonderful as this picture is, as a \"tour de force,\" like his Venus  of the same period in the National Gallery, it is a painter's picture,  and makes but a cold impression on those not interested in the technique  of painting. With the cutting away of the primitive support of fine  outline design and the absence of those accents conveying a fine form  stimulus to the mind, art has lost much of its emotional  significance.    [Illustration: Plate XI.    LOS MENENAS. BY VELAZQUEZ (PRADO)    Probably the first picture ever painted entirely from the visual or  impressionist standpoint.    _Photo Anderson_]    [Sidenote: The Impressionist Point of View.]    But art has gained a new point of view. With this subjective way of  considering appearances--this \"impressionist vision,\" as it has been  called--many things that were too ugly, either from shape or  association, to yield material for the painter, were yet found, when  viewed as part of a scheme of colour sensations on the retina which the  artist considers emotionally and rhythmically, to lend themselves to new  and beautiful harmonies and \"ensembles,\" undreamt of by the earlier  formulae. And further, many effects of light that were too hopelessly  complicated for painting, considered on the old light and shade  principles (for instance, sunlight through trees in a wood), were found  to be quite paintable, considered as an impression of various colour  masses. The early formula could never free itself from the object as a  solid thing, and had consequently to confine its attention to beautiful  ones. But from the new point of view, form consists of the shape and  qualities of masses of colour on the retina; and what objects happen to  be the outside cause of these shapes matters little to the  impressionist. Nothing is ugly when seen in a beautiful aspect of light,  and aspect is with them everything. This consideration of the visual  appearance in the first place necessitated an increased dependence on  the model. As he does not now draw from his mental perceptions the  artist has nothing to select the material of his picture from until it  has existed as a seen thing before him: until he has a visual impression  of it in his mind. With the older point of view (the representation by a  pictorial description, as it were, based on the mental idea of an  object), the model was not so necessary. In the case of the  Impressionist the mental perception is arrived at from the visual  impression, and in the older point of view the visual impression is the  result of the mental perception. Thus it happens that the Impressionist  movement has produced chiefly pictures inspired by the actual world of  visual phenomena around us, the older point of view producing most of  the pictures deriving their inspiration from the glories of the  imagination, the mental world in the mind of the artist. And although  interesting attempts are being made to produce imaginative works founded  on the impressionist point of view of light and air, the loss of  imaginative appeal consequent upon the destruction of contours by  scintillation, atmosphere, &c., and the loss of line rhythm it entails,  have so far prevented the production of any very satisfactory results.  But undoubtedly there is much new material brought to light by this  movement waiting to be used imaginatively; and it offers a new field for  the selection of expressive qualities.    This point of view, although continuing to some extent in the Spanish  school, did not come into general recognition until the last century in  France. The most extreme exponents of it are the body of artists who  grouped themselves round Claude Monet. This impressionist movement, as  the critics have labelled it, was the result of a fierce determination  to consider nature solely from the visual point of view, making no  concessions to any other associations connected with sight. The result  was an entirely new vision of nature, startling and repulsive to eyes  unaccustomed to observation from a purely visual point of view and used  only to seeing the \"feel of things,\" as it were. The first results were  naturally rather crude. But a great amount of new visual facts were  brought to light, particularly those connected with the painting of  sunlight and half light effects. Indeed the whole painting of strong  light has been permanently affected by the work of this group of  painters. Emancipated from the objective world, they no longer dissected  the object to see what was inside it, but studied rather the anatomy of  the light refracted from it to their eyes. Finding this to be composed  of all the colours of the rainbow as seen in the solar spectrum, and  that all the effects nature produced are done with different proportions  of these colours, they took them, or the nearest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#9)"],[1,"snuffed  up the smell. When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the  karakas in her wonder at him caring for things like that--caring for  the smell of lavender. How many men that she knew would have done such  a thing? Oh, how extraordinarily nice workmen were, she thought. Why  couldn't she have workmen for her friends rather than the silly boys she  danced with and who came to Sunday night supper? She would get on much  better with men like these.    It's all the fault, she decided, as the tall fellow drew something on  the back of an envelope, something that was to be looped up or left to  hang, of these absurd class distinctions. Well, for her part, she didn't  feel them. Not a bit, not an atom... And now there came the chock-chock  of wooden hammers. Some one whistled, some one sang out, \"Are you right  there, matey?\" \"Matey!\" The friendliness of it, the--the--Just to prove  how happy she was, just to show the tall fellow how at home she felt,  and how she despised stupid conventions, Laura took a big bite of her  bread-and-butter as she stared at the little drawing. She felt just like  a work-girl.    \"Laura, Laura, where are you? Telephone, Laura!\" a voice cried from the  house.    \"Coming!\" Away she skimmed, over the lawn, up the path, up the steps,  across the veranda, and into the porch. In the hall her father and  Laurie were brushing their hats ready to go to the office.    \"I say, Laura,\" said Laurie very fast, \"you might just give a squiz at  my coat before this afternoon. See if it wants pressing.\"    \"I will,\" said she. Suddenly she couldn't stop herself. She ran at  Laurie and gave him a small, quick squeeze. \"Oh, I do love parties,  don't you?\" gasped Laura.    \"Ra-ther,\" said Laurie's warm, boyish voice, and he squeezed his sister  too, and gave her a gentle push. \"Dash off to the telephone, old girl.\"    The telephone. \"Yes, yes; oh yes. Kitty? Good morning, dear. Come to  lunch? Do, dear. Delighted of course. It will only be a very scratch  meal--just the sandwich crusts and broken meringue-shells and what's  left over. Yes, isn't it a perfect morning? Your white? Oh, I certainly  should. One moment--hold the line. Mother's calling.\" And Laura sat  back. \"What, mother? Can't hear.\"    Mrs. Sheridan's voice floated down the stairs. \"Tell her to wear that  sweet hat she had on last Sunday.\"    \"Mother says you're to wear that sweet hat you had on last Sunday. Good.  One o'clock. Bye-bye.\"    Laura put back the receiver, flung her arms over her head, took a deep  breath, stretched and let them fall. \"Huh,\" she sighed, and the moment  after the sigh she sat up quickly. She was still, listening. All the  doors in the house seemed to be open. The house was alive with soft,  quick steps and running voices. The green baize door that led to the  kitchen regions swung open and shut with a muffled thud. And now there  came a long, chuckling absurd sound. It was the heavy piano being moved  on its stiff castors. But the air! If you stopped to notice, was the air  always like this? Little faint winds were playing chase, in at the tops  of the windows, out at the doors. And there were two tiny spots of  sun, one on the inkpot, one on a silver photograph frame, playing too.  Darling little spots. Especially the one on the inkpot lid. It was quite  warm. A warm little silver star. She could have kissed it.    The front door bell pealed, and there sounded the rustle of Sadie's  print skirt on the stairs. A man's voice murmured; Sadie answered,  careless, \"I'm sure I don't know. Wait. I'll ask Mrs Sheridan.\"    \"What is it, Sadie?\" Laura came into the hall.    \"It's the florist, Miss Laura.\"    It was, indeed. There, just inside the door, stood a wide, shallow tray  full of pots of pink lilies. No other kind. Nothing but lilies--canna  lilies, big pink flowers, wide open, radiant, almost frighteningly alive  on bright crimson stems.    \"O-oh, Sadie!\" said Laura, and the sound was like a little moan. She  crouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies; she felt  they were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast.    \"It's some mistake,\" she said faintly. \"Nobody ever ordered so many.  Sadie, go and find mother.\"    But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.    \"It's quite right,\" she said calmly. \"Yes, I ordered them. Aren't they  lovely?\" She pressed Laura's arm. \"I was passing the shop yesterday, and  I saw them in the window. And I suddenly thought for once in my life I  shall have enough canna lilies. The garden-party will be a good excuse.\"    \"But I thought you said you didn't mean to interfere,\" said Laura. Sadie  had gone. The florist's man was still outside at his van. She put  her arm round her mother's neck and gently, very gently, she bit her  mother's ear.    \"My darling child, you wouldn't like a logical mother, would you? Don't  do that. Here's the man.\"    He carried more lilies still, another whole tray.    \"Bank them up, just inside the door, on both sides of the porch,  please,\" said Mrs. Sheridan. \"Don't you agree, Laura?\"    \"Oh, I do, mother.\"    In the drawing-room Meg, Jose and good little Hans had at last succeeded  in moving the piano.    \"Now, if we put this chesterfield against the wall and move everything  out of the room except the chairs, don't you think?\"    \"Quite.\"    \"Hans, move these tables into the smoking-room, and bring a sweeper  to take these marks off the carpet and--one moment, Hans--\" Jose loved  giving orders to the servants, and they loved obeying her. She always  made them feel they were taking part in some drama. \"Tell mother and  Miss Laura to come here at once.\"    \"Very good, Miss Jose.\"    She turned to Meg. \"I want to hear what the piano sounds like, just  in case I'm asked to sing this afternoon. Let's try over 'This life is  Weary.'\"    Pom! Ta-ta-ta Tee-ta! The piano burst out so passionately that  Jose's face changed. She clasped her hands. She looked mournfully and  enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.         \"This Life is Wee-ary,        A Tear--a Sigh.        A Love that Chan-ges,          This Life is Wee-ary,        A Tear--a Sigh.        A Love that Chan-ges,        And then... Good-bye!\"    But at the word \"Good-bye,\" and although the piano sounded more  desperate than ever, her face broke into a brilliant, dreadfully  unsympathetic smile.    \"Aren't I in good voice, mummy?\" she beamed.         \"This Life is Wee-ary,        Hope comes to Die.        A Dream--a Wa-kening.\"    But now Sadie interrupted them. \"What is it, Sadie?\"    \"If you please, m'm, cook says have you got the flags for the  sandwiches?\"    \"The flags for the sandwiches, Sadie?\" echoed Mrs. Sheridan dreamily.  And the children knew by her face that she hadn't got them. \"Let me  see.\" And she said to Sadie firmly, \"Tell cook I'll let her have them in  ten minutes.\"    Sadie went.    \"Now, Laura,\" said her mother quickly, \"come with me into the  smoking-room. I've got the names somewhere on the back of an envelope.  You'll have to write them out for me. Meg, go upstairs this minute and  take that wet thing off your head. Jose, run and finish dressing this  instant. Do you hear me, children, or shall I have to tell your father  when he comes home to-night? And--and, Jose, pacify cook if you do go  into the kitchen, will you? I'm terrified of her this morning.\"    The envelope was found at last behind the dining-room clock, though how  it had got there Mrs. Sheridan could not imagine.    \"One of you children must have stolen it out of my bag, because I  remember vividly--cream cheese and lemon-curd. Have you done that?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Egg and--\" Mrs. Sheridan held the envelope away from her. \"It looks  like mice. It can't be mice, can it?\"    \"Olive, pet,\" said Laura, looking over her shoulder.    \"Yes, of course, olive. What a horrible combination it sounds. Egg and  olive.\"    They were finished at last, and Laura took them off to the kitchen. She  found Jose there pacifying the cook, who did not look at all terrifying.    \"I have never seen such exquisite sandwiches,\" said Jose's rapturous  voice. \"How many kinds did you say there were, cook? Fifteen?\"    \"Fifteen, Miss Jose.\"    \"Well, cook, I congratulate you.\"    Cook swept up crusts with the long sandwich knife, and smiled broadly.    \"Godber's has come,\" announced Sadie, issuing out of the pantry. She had  seen the man pass the window.    That meant the cream puffs had come. Godber's were famous for their  cream puffs. Nobody ever thought of making them at home.    \"Bring them in and put them on the table, my girl,\" ordered cook.    Sadie brought them in and went back to the door. Of course Laura and  Jose were far too grown-up to really care about such things. All the  same, they couldn't help agreeing that the puffs looked very attractive.  Very. Cook began arranging them, shaking off the extra icing sugar.    \"Don't they carry one back to all one's parties?\" said Laura.    \"I suppose they do,\" said practical Jose, who never liked to be carried  back. \"They look beautifully light and feathery, I must say.\"    \"Have one each, my dears,\" said cook in her comfortable voice. \"Yer ma  won't know.\"    Oh, impossible. Fancy cream puffs so soon after breakfast. The very idea  made one shudder. All the same, two minutes later Jose and Laura were  licking their fingers with that absorbed inward look that only comes  from whipped cream.    \"Let's go into the garden, out by the back way,\" suggested Laura. \"I  want to see how the men are getting on with the marquee. They're such  awfully nice men.\"    But the back door was blocked by cook, Sadie, Godber's man and Hans.    Something had happened.    \"Tuk-tuk-tuk,\" clucked cook like an agitated hen. Sadie had her hand  clapped to her cheek as though she had toothache. Hans's face was  screwed up in the effort to understand. Only Godber's man seemed to be  enjoying himself; it was his story.    \"What's the matter? What's happened?\""]]]
