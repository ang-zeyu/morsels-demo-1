Incredulous people declare that it is nothing  but the cry of the sea birds, which occasionally resembles bleatings,  and occasionally human lamentations; but belated fishermen swear that  they have met an old shepherd, whose head, which is covered by his  cloak, they can never see, wandering on the downs, between two tides,  round the little town placed so far out of the world, and who is  guiding and walking before them, a he-goat with a man's face, and a  she-goat with a woman's face, and both of them with white hair; and  talking incessantly, quarreling in a strange language, and then  suddenly ceasing to talk in order to bleat with all their might.    \"Do you believe it?\" I asked the monk. \"I scarcely know,\" he replied,  and I continued: \"If there are other beings besides ourselves on this  earth, how comes it that we have not known it for so long a time, or  why have you not seen them? How is it that I have not seen them?\" He  replied: \"Do we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists? Look  here; there is the wind, which is the strongest force in nature, which  knocks down men, and blows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the  sea into mountains of water, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto  the breakers; the wind which kills, which whistles, which sighs, which  roars--have you ever seen it, and can you see it? It exists for all  that, however.\"    I was silent before this simple reasoning. That man was a philosopher,  or perhaps a fool; I could not say which exactly, so I held my tongue.  What he had said, had often been in my own thoughts.    _July 3d._ I have slept badly; certainly there is some feverish  influence here, for my coachman is suffering in the same way as I am.  When I went back home yesterday, I noticed his singular paleness, and I  asked him: \"What is the matter with you, Jean?\" \"The matter is that I  never get any rest, and my nights devour my days. Since your departure,  monsieur, there has been a spell over me.\"    However, the other servants are all well, but I am very frightened of  having another attack, myself.    _July 4th._ I am decidedly taken again; for my old nightmares have  returned. Last night I felt somebody leaning on me who was sucking my  life from between my lips with his mouth. Yes, he was sucking it out of  my neck, like a leech would have done. Then he got up, satiated, and I  woke up, so beaten, crushed and annihilated that I could not move. If  this continues for a few days, I shall certainly go away again.    _July 5th._ Have I lost my reason? What has happened, what I saw last  night, is so strange, that my head wanders when I think of it!    As I do now every evening, I had locked my door, and then, being  thirsty, I drank half a glass of water, and I accidentally noticed that  the water bottle was full up to the cut-glass stopper.    Then I went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps, from which  I was aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible shock.    Picture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered and who wakes  up with a knife in his chest, and who is rattling in his throat,  covered with blood, and who can no longer breathe, and is going to die,  and does not understand anything at all about it--there it is.    Having recovered my senses, I was thirsty again, so I lit a candle and  went to the table on which my water bottle was. I lifted it up and  tilted it over my glass, but nothing came out. It was empty! It was  completely empty! At first I could not understand it at all, and then  suddenly I was seized by such a terrible feeling that I had to sit  down, or rather I fell into a chair! Then I sprang up with a bound to  look about me, and then I sat down again, overcome by astonishment and  fear, in front of the transparent crystal bottle! I looked at it with  fixed eyes, trying to conjecture, and my hands trembled! Somebody had  drunk the water, but who? I? I without any doubt. It could surely only  be I? In that case I was a somnambulist. I lived, without knowing it,  that double mysterious life which makes us doubt whether there are not  two beings in us, or whether a strange, unknowable and invisible being  does not at such moments, when our soul is in a state of torpor,  animate our captive body which obeys this other being, as it does us  ourselves, and more than it does ourselves.    Oh! Who will understand my horrible agony? Who will understand the  emotion of a man who is sound in mind, wide awake, full of sound sense,  and who looks in horror at the remains of a little water that has  disappeared while he was asleep, through the glass of a water bottle?  And I remained there until it was daylight, without venturing to go to  bed again.    _July 6th._ I am going mad. Again all the contents of my water bottle  have been drunk during the night--or rather, I have drunk it!    But is it I? Is it I? Who could it be? Who? Oh! God! Am I going mad?  Who will save me?    _July 10th._ I have just been through some surprising ordeals.  Decidedly I am mad! And yet!--    On July 6th, before going to bed, I put some wine, milk, water, bread  and strawberries on my table. Somebody drank--I drank--all the water  and a little of the milk, but neither the wine, bread nor the  strawberries were touched.    On the seventh of July I renewed the same experiment, with the same  results, and on July 8th, I left out the water and the milk and nothing  was touched.    Lastly, on July 9th I put only water and milk on my table, taking care  to wrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the stoppers.  Then I rubbed my lips, my beard and my hands with pencil lead, and went  to bed.    Irresistible sleep seized me, which was soon followed by a terrible  awakening. I had not moved, and my sheets were not marked. I rushed to  the table. The muslin round the bottles remained intact; I undid the  string, trembling with fear. All the water had been drunk, and so had  the milk! Ah! Great God!--    I must start for Paris immediately.    _July 12th._ Paris. I must have lost my head during the last few days!  I must be the plaything of my enervated imagination, unless I am really  a somnambulist, or that I have been brought under the power of one of  those influences which have been proved to exist, but which have  hitherto been inexplicable, which are called suggestions. In any case,  my mental state bordered on madness, and twenty-four hours of Paris  sufficed to restore me to my equilibrium.    Yesterday after doing some business and paying some visits which  instilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me, I wound up my  evening at the _Theatre Francais_. A play by Alexandre Dumas the  Younger was being acted, and his active and powerful mind completed my  cure. Certainly solitude is dangerous for active minds. We require men  who can think and can talk, around us. When we are alone for a long  time we people space with phantoms.    I returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits. Amid  the jostling of the crowd I thought, not without irony, of my terrors  and surmises of the previous week, because I believed, yes, I believed,  that an invisible being lived beneath my roof. How weak our head is,  and how quickly it is terrified and goes astray, as soon, as we are  struck by a small, incomprehensible fact.    Instead of concluding with these simple words: \"I do not understand  because the cause escapes me,\" we immediately imagine terrible  mysteries and supernatural powers.    _July 14th._ _Fete_ of the Republic. I walked through the streets, and  the crackers and flags amused me like a child. Still it is very foolish  to be merry on a fixed date, by a Government decree. The populace is an  imbecile flock of sheep, now steadily patient, and now in ferocious  revolt. Say to it: \"Amuse yourself,\" and it amuses itself. Say to it:  \"Go and fight with your neighbor,\" and it goes and fights. Say to it:  \"Vote for the Emperor,\" and it votes for the Emperor, and then say to  it: \"Vote for the Republic,\" and it votes for the Republic.    Those who direct it are also stupid; but instead of obeying men they  obey principles, which can only be stupid, sterile, and false, for the  very reason that they are principles, that is to say, ideas which are  considered as certain and unchangeable, in this world where one is  certain of nothing, since light is an illusion and noise is an  illusion.    _July 16th._ I saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much.    I was dining at my cousin's Madame Sable, whose husband is colonel of  the 76th Chasseurs at Limoges. There were two young women there, one of  whom had married a medical man, Dr. Parent, who devotes himself a great  deal to nervous diseases and the extraordinary manifestations to which  at this moment experiments in hypnotism and suggestion give rise.    He related to us at some length, the enormous results obtained by  English scientists and the doctors of the medical school at Nancy, and  the facts which he adduced appeared to me so strange, that I declared  that I was altogether incredulous.    \"We are,\" he declared, \"on the point of discovering one of the most  important secrets of nature, I mean to say, one of its most important  secrets on this earth, for there are certainly some which are of a  different kind of importance up in the stars, yonder. Ever since man  has thought, since he has been able to express and write down his  thoughts, he has felt himself close to a mystery which is impenetrable  to his coarse and imperfect senses, and he endeavors to supplement the  want of power of his organs by the efforts of his intellect. As long as  that intellect still remained in its elementary stage, this intercourse  with invisible spirits assumed forms which were commonplace though  terrifying. Thence sprang the popular belief in the supernatural, the  legends of wandering "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#9)"],[1," guess,\" smiled Dave wearily.  \"Have  you found out--\"    \"Dave it's the most absurd sort of lie!  You know that Farley  and his little crowd got caught last night, when they returned  from their Frenching party over the wall?\"    \"Frenching\" is taking unauthorized leave from the academic limits  by going over the wall, instead of through the gate.    \"Yes; I know Farley and his friends got caught,\" rejoined Darrin.  \"But what has that to do with me?    \"Farley and his friends are sore--\"    \"They ought not to be,\" said Darrin quietly.  \"They took the chance,  and now they ought to be ready to pay up like good sportsmen.\"    \"Dave, _they say you informed on them, and got them caught!_\"    \"What?\" shouted Darrin, leaping to his feet.  His face was deathly  white and the corners of his mouth twitched.    He took two bounding steps toward the door, but Dalzell threw  himself in his chum's way.    \"Not just this minute, Dave!\" ordered Dan firmly.  \"We don't want  any manslaughter here--not even of the 'justifiable' kind!  Sit and wait until you've cooled off--some.  When you go out  I'm going with you--whether it's out into the corridor, or out  of the Naval Academy for good.  Sit down, now!  Try to talk it  over coolly, and get yourself into a frame of mind where you can  talk with others without prejudicing your case.\"    \"My case?\" repeated Dave bitterly, as he allowed Dan to force  him back into his chair.  \"I haven't any case.  I haven't done  anything.\"    \"I know that, but you've got to get cool, and stay so, if you want  to make sure that others have a chance to know it,\" warned Dan.    \"Does Farley say that I sneaked in information against him?\"    \"Farley and the others are so sore over their demerits that they  believe almost anything, now, and they say almost anything.  Of  course, Farley remembers the row he had with you last night.  In a fool way he puts two and two together, an decides that you  helped set the trap for them.\"    \"If I had done a dirty thing like that, then I'd deserve to be  cut by the whole brigade,\" retorted Dave, his face flushing.    \"But I want to tell you, right now, Dave, that some of the fellows  of our class know you too well to believe any such thing against you.\"    \"I'm properly grateful to the few, then,\" retorted Darrin, his eyes  softening a trifle.  \"But come along, Dan, if you will.  I mean to  start in at once to sift this thing down.\"    \"Let me look at you,\" ordered Dalzell, grappling with his chum,  and looking him over.    Then, a moment later, Dan added:    \"Yes; you're cool enough, I think.  I'll go with you.  But remember  that the easiest way to destroy yourself is to let your temper  get on top.  If anybody is to get mad before the crowd, let me  do it.  Then you can restrain me if I get too violent.\"    Dave Darrin took his uniform cap down from the nail and put it  on with great deliberation.  Next, he picked up his whisk broom,  flecking off two or three imaginary specks of dust.    \"Now, I guess we can go along, Danny boy,\" he remarked, in a tone  of ominous quietness.    \"Where are you headed?\" murmured Dalzell, as they reached the  room door.    \"To Farley's room,\" answered Dave Darrin coolly.  \"Do you suppose  he's there?\"    \"He was, a few moments ago\" Dan answered.    \"Then let us hope he is now.\"    Carrying himself with his most erect and military air, Darrin  stepped down the corridor, Dalzell keeping exactly at his side.    The chums arrived before the door of the room in which Farley was  lodged.    Dave raised his hand, sounding a light knock on the door, which  he next pushed open.    Farley and a dozen other members of the fourth class were in the  room.  Moreover, it was evident instantly that some of those present  were discussing the burning class issue.    \"But are you sure he did it?  Farley?\" one midshipman inquired,  as the chums entered.    \"Sure?\" repeated Farley.  \"Of course I am!  Didn't I tell you what  a hot row we had.  Darrin--\"    \"I'm here to speak for myself, Farley,\" boomed in the quiet, steady  voice of Dave Darrin.  \"But I'll hear you first, if you wish.\"    \"Oh, you're here, are you?\" cried Farley hotly, wheeling about  on the visitors.    Some of the other fourth class men present turned and glanced  coldly at the two last-comers.  Others looked on with eager curiosity.    \"I've heard,\" announced Darrin, \"that you are saying some things  about me that don't sound well.  So I've come to ask you what you  are saying.\"    \"I won't keep you waiting,\" jeered Farley.  \"You know, from hearing  morning orders, that six of us were given fifty demerits apiece.\"    \"For going over the wall to a late supper in town,\" nodded Dave.    \"You wouldn't go with us,\" continued Farley angrily, \"and gave  us a greaser's talk-fest instead.\"    \"I didn't advise you against going,\" responded Dave, standing  with his arms folded, utterly cool as he eyed his accuser.    \"Then, after we went, some one went and wised the powers,\" charged  Farley.  \"Now, no one but a most abandoned greaser would do that.\"    To \"wise the powers\" is to give information to the Naval officers.    \"The fellow who would wilfully tell on you would be worse than  what you term a greaser,\" agreed Dave.    \"Careful,\" warned Farley ironically.  \"You know who told, or who  caused the wise word to leak to the powers.\"    \"I don't,\" Dave denied bluntly.    \"You're the sneak, yourself!\" cried Farley angrily.    \"I am not,\" spoke Dave, with clear denial.    \"Do you mean to say I lie?\" demanded Midshipman Farley threateningly,  as he took a step forward.    \"Do you deliberately state that I informed upon you, or caused  you to be informed upon?\" demanded Dave Darrin.    \"Yes, I do!    \"Then you lie!\" returned Darrin promptly.    With a suppressed yell Farley sprang at Darrin, and the latter  struck out quickly.          CHAPTER VII    ON THE FIELD OF THE CODE      Midshipman Farley had the bad judgment to stop that blow with  the side of his neck.    Across the room he spun, going down in a heap, his head under  the study table.    Dave Darrin looked on with a cool smile, while Farley lay there  for an instant, then scrambled out and up onto his feet.    But two or three other new midshipmen sprang in between Dave and  his accuser.    \"We can't have a fight here, Farley,\" urged two or three in the  same breath.    \"Let me at the sneak!\" sputtered Farley who was boiling over with  rage.    \"Yes; let him at me,\" voiced Dave coolly, \"and I'll send him into  the middle of next term!\"    But three of the midshipmen clung to Farley, who furiously strove to  fling them off.    \"Let me at him!\" insisted the accuser.  \"He struck me.\"    \"You struck at him first, and didn't land,\" replied one of the  peacemakers.  \"You go on with a fight here, and you'll bring the  officer in charge down on us all.  Farley, if you feel you've  a grievance you are privileged to take recourse to the regular  code in such matters.\"    \"The fellow has lied about me, and I'm ready to settle it with  him now, or outside by appointment,\" broke in Dave, speaking as  coolly as before.    \"He calls me 'fellow' and 'liar,'\" panted Farley, turning white.  \"Do you think I can stand that?    \"You don't have to,\" replied one of those who held Farley back.  \"Send Darrin a challenge, in the regular way.\"    \"I will!\" panted Midshipman Farley.  \"And I'll hammer him all over  and out of the meeting-place!\"    \"Then it's settled for a challenge,\" interposed Dan Dalzell.  \"That will suit us all right.  We'll be ready whenever the challenge  comes.  And now, to prevent getting a lot of decent fellows into  a needless scrape, Darrin and I will withdraw.\"    Dan took Dave by the arm, and both turned to leave the room.    \"You--\" began Farley hoarsely, when another midshipman clapped  a hand over his mouth.    \"Shut up Farley!  Save all of your undoubted grit for the field, when  you two meet.\"    The door closed softly behind Darrin and Dalzell.    \"Why didn't you let me at the sneak?\" bellowed Farley, released,  now, from interfering hands.    \"See here, Farley,\" advised one of his friends, \"cool down and keep  your face in a restful attitude.  Darrin behaved twice as well as  you did.  If you don't look out you'll lose the sympathy of the  class.  Just keep cool, and restrain your tongue from wagging until  you've met Darrin.  Don't try to start the row again, this side of  the field where you meet.  If you do, you'll get many a cold shoulder.\"    Other midshipmen present spoke in the same vein.  Farley, who  wanted to be popular at all times, presently allowed himself to  be advised.    Of course the news of the meeting, and of the more emphatic one to  come spread fast through Bancroft Hall.  There is an unknown  wireless that carries all such news on wings through the brigade  of midshipmen.    Within half an hour Henkel and Page brought the challenge to Dave  Darrin.  Dan, in the meantime, had been busy, and had induced  Midshipman Rollins, of the fourth class, to act with him as second.  Rollins, indeed, needed little urging.  He was eager to see the  fight.    Tyson, of the second class, was secured as referee, while Trotter,  of the third class, gladly agreed to act as time-keeper.    The time was set for an hour before taps, as, on this evening,  it would be easy for all the young men involved to slip away and  be back in time for taps.    \"I won't let the thing run over two rounds,\" promised Farley,  who had an excellent idea of himself as a fighter.    That afternoon Dave and Farley were obliged to pass each other.  Dave did not even seem to know that his enemy was around.  Farley,  on the other hand, glared ferociously at Darrin as he passed.    Midshipman Trotter certainly would have come around to offer Dave  friendly counsel, had not his position as one of the officials  of the fight restrained him.    Dave, by his prompt action, had veered many of his classmates  around to his side.  The bulk of opinion in the "]]]
