Development of these distinctions led to  carelessness of articulation, and multiplication of what would be  homonyms but for these tones. It is incorrect to assume that the tones  were invented to distinguish similar sounds. So that, at the present  day, anyone who says _ma_ will mean either an exclamation, hemp,  horse, or curse according to the quality he gives to the sound. The  language remains in a primitive state, without inflexion, declension,  or distinction of parts of speech. The order in a sentence is: subject,  verb, complement direct, complement indirect. Gender is formed by  distinctive particles; number by prefixing numerals, etc.; cases  by position or appropriate prepositions. Adjectives precede nouns;  position determines comparison; and absence of punctuation causes  ambiguity. The latter is now introduced into most newly published  works. The new education is bringing with it innumerable words and  phrases not found in the old literature or dictionaries. Japanese  idioms which are now being imported into the language are making it  less pure.    The written language, too well known to need detailed description, a  thing of beauty and a joy for ever to those able to appreciate it, said  to have taken originally the form of knotted cords and then of notches  on wood (though this was more probably the origin of numeration than of  writing proper), took later that of rude outlines of natural objects,  and then went on to the phonetic system, under which each character is  composed of two parts, the radical, indicating the meaning, and the  phonetic, indicating the sound. They were symbols, non-agglutinative  and non-inflexional, and were written in vertical columns, probably  from having in early times been painted or cut on strips of bark.      Achievements of the Chinese    As the result of all this fitful fever during so many centuries,  we find that the Chinese, after having lived in nests \"in order to  avoid the animals,\" and then in caves, have built themselves houses  and palaces which are still made after the pattern of their prototype,  with a flat wall behind, the openings in front, the walls put in after  the pillars and roof-tree have been fixed, and out-buildings added on  as side extensions. The _k'ang_, or 'stove-bed' (now a platform made  of bricks), found all over the northern provinces, was a place scooped  out of the side of the cave, with an opening underneath in which (as  now) a fire was lit in winter. Windows and shutters opened upward,  being a survival of the mat or shade hung in front of the apertures  in the walls of the primitive cave-dwelling. Four of these buildings  facing each other round a square made the courtyard, and one or more  courtyards made the compound. They have fed themselves on almost  everything edible to be found on, under, or above land or water,  except milk, but live chiefly on rice, chicken, fish, vegetables,  including garlic, and tea, though at one time they ate flesh and  drank wine, sometimes to excess, before tea was cultivated. They  have clothed themselves in skins and feathers, and then in silks  and satins, but mostly in cotton, and hardly ever in wool. Under  the Manchu _regime_ the type of dress adopted was that of this  horse-riding race, showing the chief characteristics of that noble  animal, the broad sleeves representing the hoofs, the queue the mane,  etc. This queue was formed of the hair growing from the back part  of the scalp, the front of which was shaved. Unlike the Egyptians,  they did not wear wigs. They have nearly always had the decency to  wear their coats long, and have despised the Westerner for wearing  his too short. They are now paradoxical enough to make the mistake  of adopting the Westerner's costume.    They have made to themselves great canals, bridges, aqueducts, and  the longest wall there has ever been on the face of the earth (which  could not be seen from the moon, as some sinologists have erroneously  supposed, any more than a hair, however long, could be seen at a  distance of a hundred yards). They have made long and wide roads, but  failed to keep them in repair during the last few centuries, though  much zeal, possibly due to commerce on oil- or electricity-driven  wheels, is now being shown in this direction. They have built honorary  portals to chaste widows, pagodas, and arched bridges of great beauty,  not forgetting to surround each city with a high and substantial wall  to keep out unfriendly people. They have made innumerable implements  and weapons, from pens and fans and chopsticks to ploughs and carts  and ships; from fiery darts, 'flame elephants,' bows and spears,  spiked chariots, battering-rams, and hurling-engines to mangonels,  trebuchets, matchlocks of wrought iron and plain bore with long  barrels resting on a stock, and gingals fourteen feet long resting on  a tripod, cuirasses of quilted cotton cloth covered with brass knobs,  and helmets of iron or polished steel, sometimes inlaid, with neck-  and ear-lappets. And they have been content not to improve upon these  to any appreciable extent; but have lately shown a tendency to make  the later patterns imported from the West in their own factories.    They have produced one of the greatest and most remarkable  accumulations of literature the world has ever seen, and the finest  porcelain; some music, not very fine; and some magnificent painting,  though hardly any sculpture, and little architecture that will live.        CHAPTER II    On Chinese Mythology      Mythology and Intellectual Progress    The Manichaest, _yin-yang_ (dualist), idea of existence, to which  further reference will be made in the next chapter, finds its  illustration in the dual life, real and imaginary, of all the  peoples of the earth. They have both real histories and mythological  histories. In the preceding chapter I have dealt briefly with the  first--the life of reality--in China from the earliest times to the  present day; the succeeding chapters are concerned with the second--the  life of imagination. A survey of the first was necessary for a complete  understanding of the second. The two react upon each other, affecting  the national character and through it the history of the world.    Mythology is the science of the unscientific man's explanation  of what we call the Otherworld--itself and its denizens, their  mysterious habits and surprising actions both there and here, usually  including the creation of this world also. By the Otherworld he does  not necessarily mean anything distant or even invisible, though the  things he explains would mostly be included by us under those terms. In  some countries myths are abundant, in others scarce. Why should this  be? Why should some peoples tell many and marvellous tales about their  gods and others say little about them, though they may say a great deal  to them? We recall the 'great' myths of Greece and Scandinavia. Other  races are 'poor' in myths. The difference is to be explained by the  mental characters of the peoples as moulded by their surroundings and  hereditary tendencies. The problem is of course a psychological one,  for it is, as already noted, in imagination that myths have their  root. Now imagination grows with each stage of intellectual progress,  for intellectual progress implies increasing representativeness of  thought. In the lower stages of human development imagination is feeble  and unproductive; in the highest stages it is strong and constructive.      The Chinese Intellect    The Chinese are not unimaginative, but their minds did not go on to the  construction of any myths which should be world-great and immortal;  and one reason why they did not construct such myths was that their  intellectual progress was arrested at a comparatively early stage. It  was arrested because there was not that contact and competition  with other peoples which demands brain-work of an active kind as the  alternative of subjugation, inferiority, or extinction, and because,  as we have already seen, the knowledge required of them was mainly  the parrot-like repetition of the old instead of the thinking-out of  the new [1]--a state of things rendered possible by the isolation  just referred to. Confucius discountenanced discussion about the  supernatural, and just as it is probable that the exhortations of Wen  Wang, the virtual founder of the Chou dynasty (1121-255 B.C.), against  drunkenness, in a time before tea was known to them, helped to make  the Chinese the sober people that they are, so it is probable--more  than probable--that this attitude of Confucius may have nipped in  the bud much that might have developed a vigorous mythology, though  for a reason to be stated later it may be doubted if he thereby  deprived the world of any beautiful and marvellous results of the  highest flights of poetical creativeness. There are times, such as  those of any great political upheaval, when human nature will assert  itself and break through its shackles in spite of all artificial  or conventional restraints. Considering the enormous influence of  Confucianism throughout the latter half of Chinese history--_i.e._  the last two thousand years--it is surprising that the Chinese dared  to think about supernatural matters at all, except in the matter of  propitiating their dead ancestors. That they did so is evidence not  only of human nature's inherent tendency to tell stories, but also  of the irrepressible strength of feeling which breaks all laws and  commandments under great stimulus. On the opposing unaesthetic side  this may be compared to the feeling which prompts the unpremeditated  assassination of a man who is guilty of great injustice, even though  it be certain that in due course he would have met his deserts at  the hands of the public"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#9)"],[1,"emotional theism only as an  imperfect creed and not as the highest truth. But the existence of all  sects and priesthoods depends on their power to satisfy the religious  instinct with ceremonial or some better method of putting the soul in  communication with the divine. On the other hand pantheism in India is  not a philosophical speculation, it is a habit of mind: it is not enough  for the Hindu that his God is lord of all things: he must _be_ all  things and the soul in its endeavour to reach God must obtain  deliverance from the fetters not only of matter but of individuality.  Hence Hindu theology is in a perpetual oscillation illustrated by the  discrepant statements found side by side in the Bhagavad-gita and other  works. Indian temperament and Indian logic want a pantheistic God and a  soul which can transcend personality, but religious thought and practice  imply personality both in the soul and in God. All varieties of  Vishnuism show an effort to reconcile these double aspirations and  theories. The theistic view is popular, for without it what would become  of temples, worshippers and priests? But I think that the pantheistic  view is the real basis of Indian religious thought.    The qualified monism of Ramanuja (as his system is sometimes called) led  to more uncompromising treatment of the question and to the affirmation  of dualism, not the dualism of God and the Devil but the distinctness of  the soul and of matter from God. This is the doctrine of Madhva, another  southern teacher who lived about a century after Ramanuja and was  perhaps directly influenced by Islam. But though the logical outcome of  his teaching may appear to be simple theism analogous to Islam or  Judaism, it does not in practice lead to this result but rather to the  worship of Krishna. Madhva's sect is still important but even more  important is another branch of the spiritual family of Ramanuja,  starting from Ramanand who probably flourished in the fourteenth  century[28].    Ramanuja, while in some ways accepting innovations, insisted on the  strict observance of caste. Ramanand abandoned this, separated from his  sect and removed to Benares. His teaching marks a turning-point in the  history of modern Hinduism. Firstly he held that caste need not prevent  a man from rightly worshipping God and he admitted even Moslims as  members of his community. To this liberality are directly traceable the  numerous sects combining Hindu with Mohammedan doctrines, among which  the Kabir Panthis and the Sikhs are the most conspicuous. But it is a  singular testimony to the tenacity of Hindu ideas that though many  teachers holding most diverse opinions have declared there is no caste  before God, yet caste has generally reasserted itself among their  followers as a social if not as a religious institution. The second  important point in Ramanand's teaching was the use of the vernacular for  religious literature. Dravidian scriptures had already been recognized  in the south but it is from this time that there begins to flow in the  north that great stream of sacred poetry in Hindi and Bengali which  waters the roots of modern popular Hinduism. Among many eminent names  which have contributed to it, the greatest is Tulsi Das who retold the  Ramayana in Hindi and thus wrote a poem which is little less than a  Bible for millions in the Ganges valley.    The sects which derive from the teaching of Ramanand mostly worship the  Supreme Being under the name of Rama. Even more numerous, especially in  the north, are those who use the name of Krishna, the other great  incarnation of Vishnu. This worship was organized and extended by the  preaching of Vallabha and Caitanya (c. 1500) in the valley of the Ganges  and Bengal, but was not new. I shall discuss in some detail below the  many elements combined in the complex figure of Krishna but in one way  or another he was connected with the earliest forms of Vishnuite  monotheism and is the chief figure in the Bhagavad-gita, its earliest  text-book. Legend connects him partly with Muttra and partly with  western India but, though by no means ignored in southern India, he does  not receive there such definite and exclusive adoration as in the north.  The Krishnaite sects are emotional, and their favourite doctrine that  the relation between God and the soul is typified by passionate love has  led to dubious moral results.    This Krishnaite propaganda, which coincided with the Reformation in  Europe, was the last great religious movement in India. Since that time  there has been considerable activity of a minor kind. Protests have been  raised against abuses and existing communities have undergone changes,  such as may be seen in the growth of the Sikhs, but there has been no  general or original movement. The absence of such can be easily  explained by the persecutions of Aurungzeb and by the invasions and  internal struggles of the eighteenth century. At the end of that century  Hinduism was at its lowest but its productive power was not destroyed.  The decennial census never fails to record the rise of new sects and the  sudden growth of others which had been obscure and minute.    Any historical treatment of Hinduism inevitably makes Vishnuism seem  more prominent than other sects, for it offers more events to record.  But though Sivaism has undergone fewer changes and produced fewer great  names, it must not be thought of as lifeless or decadent. The lingam is  worshipped all over India and many of the most celebrated shrines, such  as Benares and Bhubaneshwar, are dedicated to the Lord of life and  death. The Sivaism of the Tamil country is one of the most energetic and  progressive forms of modern Hinduism, but in doctrine it hardly varies  from the ancient standard of the Tiruvacagam.      9. _European Influence and Modern Hinduism_    The small effect of European religion on Hinduism is remarkable. Islam,  though aggressively hostile, yet fused with it in some sects, for  instance the Sikhs, but such fusions of Indian religion and Christianity  as have been noted[29] are microscopic curiosities. European free  thought and Deism have not fared better, for the Brahmo Samaj which was  founded under their inspiration has only 5504 adherents[30]. In social  life there has been some change: caste restrictions, though not  abolished, are evaded by ingenious subterfuges and there is a growing  feeling against child-marriage. Yet were the laws against sati and human  sacrifice repealed, there are many districts in which such practices  would not be forbidden by popular sentiment.    It is easy to explain the insensibility of Hinduism to European contact:  even Islam had little effect on its stubborn vitality, though Islam  brought with it settlers and resident rulers, ready to make converts by  force. But the British have shown perfect toleration and are merely  sojourners in the land who spend their youth and age elsewhere. European  exclusiveness and Indian ideas about caste alike made it natural to  regard them as an isolated class charged with the business of Government  but divorced from the intellectual and religious life of other classes.  Previous experience of Moslims and other invaders disposed the Brahmans  to accept foreigners as rulers without admitting that their creeds and  customs were in the least worthy of imitation. European methods of  organization and advertisement have not however been disdained.    The last half century has witnessed a remarkable revival of Hinduism. In  the previous decades the most conspicuous force in India, although  numerically weak, was the already mentioned Brahmo Samaj, founded by Ram  Mohun Roy in 1828. But it was colourless and wanting in constructive  power. Educated opinion, at least in Bengal, seemed to be tending  towards agnosticism and social revolution. This tendency was checked by  a conservative and nationalist movement, which in all its varied phases  gave support to Indian religion and was intolerant of European ideas. It  had a political side but there was nothing disloyal in its main idea,  namely, that in the intellectual and religious sphere, where Indian life  is most intense, Indian ideas must not decay. No one who has known India  during the last thirty years can have failed to notice how many new  temples have been built and how many old ones repaired. Almost all the  principal sects have founded associations to protect and extend their  interests by such means as financial and administrative organization,  the publication of periodicals and other literature, annual conferences,  lectures and the foundation of religious houses or quasi-monastic  orders. Several societies have been founded not restricted to any  particular sect but with the avowed object of defending and promoting  strict Hinduism. Among such the most important are, first the Bharat  Dharma Mahamandala, under the distinguished presidency of the Maharaja  of Darbhanga: secondly the movement started by Ramakrishna and Swami  Vivekananda and adorned by the beautiful life and writings of Sister  Nivedita (Miss Noble) and thirdly the Theosophical Society under the  leadership of Mrs Besant. It is remarkable that Europeans, both men and  women, have played a considerable part in this revival. All these  organizations are influential: the two latter have done great service in  defending and encouraging Hinduism, but I am less sure of their success  in mingling Eastern and Western ideas or in popularizing Hinduism among  Europeans.    Somewhat different, but described by the Census of 1911 as \"the greatest  religious movement in India of the past half century\" is the Arya Samaj,  founded in 1875 by Swami Dayanand. Whereas the movements mentioned above  support Sanatana Dharma or Orthodox Hinduism in all its shapes, the Arya  Samaj aims at reform. Its original programme was a revival of the  ancient Vedic religion but it has since been perceptibly modified"]]]
