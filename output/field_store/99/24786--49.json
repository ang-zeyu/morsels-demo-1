[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#9)"],[1," the varying disposition of the  heads of the figures in the four groups of three; the law of Balance  in the essential symmetry of the entire composition; the law of  Rhythmic Change in the diminishing of the wall and ceiling spaces; and  the law of Radiation in the convergence of all the perspective lines  to a single significant point.    To illustrate further the universality of these laws, consider now  their application to a single work of architecture: the Taj Mahal, one  of the most beautiful buildings of the world (Illustration 36). It is  a unit, but twofold, for it consists of a curved part and an angular  part, roughly figured as an inverted cup upon a cube; each of these  (seen in parallel perspective, at the end of the principal vista) is  threefold, for there are two sides and a central parallelogram, and  two lesser domes flank the great dome. The composition is rich in  consonances, for the side arches echo the central one, the subordinate  domes the great dome, and the lanterns of the outstanding minarets  repeat the principal motif. Diversity in Monotony appears abundantly  in the ornament, which is intricate and infinitely various; the law of  Balance is everywhere operative in the symmetry of the entire design.  Rhythmic Change appears in the tapering of the minarets, the outlines  of the domes and their mass relations to one another; and finally,  the whole effect is of radiation from a central point, of elements  disposed on radial lines.    It would be fatuous to contend that the prime object of a work of  architecture is to obey and illustrate these laws. The prime object of  a work of architecture is to fulfill certain definite conditions in a  practical, economical, and admirable way, and in fulfilling to express  as far as possible these conditions, making the form express the  function. The architect who is also an artist however will do this  and something beyond: working for the most part unconsciously,  harmoniously, joyously, his building will obey and illustrate natural  laws--these laws of beauty--and to the extent it does so it will be a  work of art; for art is the method of nature carried into those higher  regions of thought and feeling which man alone inhabits: regions which  it is one of the purposes of theosophy to explore.          IV    THE BODILY TEMPLE      Carlyle says: \"There is but one temple in the world, and that is the  body of man.\" If the body is, as he declares, a temple, it is not less  true that a temple or any work of architectural art is a larger body  which man has created for his uses, just as the individual self is  housed within its stronghold of flesh and bones. Architectural beauty  like human beauty depends upon the proper subordination of parts  to the whole, the harmonious interrelation between these parts, the  expressiveness of each of its function or functions, and when these  are many and diverse, their reconcilement one with another. This being  so, a study of the human figure with a view to analyzing the sources  of its beauty cannot fail to be profitable. Pursued intelligently,  such a study will stimulate the mind to a perception of those simple  yet subtle laws according to which nature everywhere works, and  it will educate the eye in the finest known school of proportion,  training it to distinguish minute differences, in the same way that  the hearing of good music cultivates the ear.    Those principles of natural beauty which formed the subject of the  two preceding essays are all exemplified in the ideally perfect human  figure. Though essentially a unit, there is a well marked division  into right and left--\"Hands to hands, and feet to feet, in one body  grooms and brides.\" There are two arms, two legs, two ears, two eyes,  and two lids to each eye; the nose has two nostrils, the mouth has  two lips. Moreover, the terms of such pairs are masculine and feminine  with respect to each other, one being active and the other passive.  Owing to the great size and one-sided position of the liver, the right  half of the body is heavier than the left; the right arm is usually  longer and more muscular than the left; the right eye is slightly  higher than its fellow. In speaking and eating the lower jaw and under  lip are active and mobile with relation to the upper; in winking it is  the upper eyelid which is the more active. That \"inevitable duality\"  which is exhibited in the form of the body characterizes its motions  also. In the act of walking for example, a forward movement is  attained by means of a forward and a backward movement of the thighs  on the axis of the hips; this leg movement becomes twofold again below  the knee, and the feet move up and down independently on the axis of  the ankle. A similar progression is followed in raising the arm and  hand: motion is communicated first to the larger parts, through them  to the smaller and thence to the extremities, becoming more rapid and  complex as it progresses, so that all free and natural movements of  the limbs describe invisible lines of beauty in the air. Coexistent  with this pervasive duality there is a threefold division of the  figure into trunk, head and limbs: a superior trinity of head and  arms, and an inferior trinity of trunk and legs. The limbs are divided  threefold into upper-arm, forearm and hand; thigh, leg and foot. The  hand flowers out into fingers and the foot into toes, each with a  threefold articulation; and in this way is effected that transition  from unity to multiplicity, from simplicity to complexity, which  appears to be so universal throughout nature, and of which a tree is  the perfect symbol.    [Illustration 37: THE LAW OF RHYTHMIC DIMINUTION ILLUSTRATED IN THE  TAPERING BODY, LIMBS, FINGERS & TOES.]    [Illustration 38]    [Illustration 39]    The body is rich in veiled repetitions, echoes, _consonances_. The  head and arms are in a sense a refinement upon the trunk and legs,  there being a clearly traceable correspondence between their various  parts. The hand is the body in little--_\"Your soft hand is a woman of  itself\"_--the palm, the trunk; the four fingers, the four limbs; and  the thumb, the head;-each finger is a little arm, each finger tip a  little palm. The lips are the lids of the mouth, the lids are the  lips of the eyes--and so on. The law of _Rhythmic Diminution_ is  illustrated in the tapering of the entire body and of the limbs, in  the graduated sizes and lengths of the palm and the toes, and in  the successively decreasing length of the palm and the joints of the  fingers, so that in closing the hand the fingers describe natural  spirals (Illustrations 37, 38). Finally, the limbs radiate as it were  from the trunk, the fingers from a point in the wrist, the toes from  a point in the ankle. The ribs radiate from the spinal column like the  veins of a leaf from its midrib (Illustration 39).    [Illustration 40]    The relation of these laws of beauty to the art of architecture has  been shown already. They are reiterated here only to show that man is  indeed the microcosm--a little world fashioned from the same elements  and in accordance with the same _Beautiful Necessity_ as is the  greater world in which he dwells. When he builds a house or temple he  builds it not literally in his own image, but according to the laws of  his own being, and there are correspondences not altogether fanciful  between the animate body of flesh and the inanimate body of stone. Do  we not all of us, consciously or unconsciously, recognize the fact  of character and physiognomy in buildings? Are they not, to our  imagination, masculine or feminine, winning or forbidding--_human_,  in point of fact--to a greater degree than anything else of man's  creating? They are this certainly to a true lover and student of  architecture. Seen from a distance the great French cathedrals appear  like crouching monsters, half beast, half human: the two towers stand  like a man and a woman, mysterious and gigantic, looking out over city  and plain. The campaniles of Italy rise above the churches and houses  like the sentinels of a sleeping camp--nor is their strangely human  aspect wholly imaginary: these giants of mountain and campagna have  eyes and brazen tongues; rising four square, story above story, with  a belfry or lookout, like a head, atop, their likeness to a man is not  infrequently enhanced by a certain identity of proportion--of ratio,  that is, of height to width: Giotto's beautiful tower is an example.  The caryatid is a supporting member in the form of a woman; in the  Ionic column we discern her stiffened, like Lot's wife, into a pillar,  with nothing to show her feminine but the spirals of her beautiful  hair. The columns which uphold the pediment of the Parthenon are  unmistakably masculine: the ratio of their breadth to their height is  the ratio of the breadth to the height of a man (Illustration 40).    [Illustration 41: THE BODY THE ARCHETYPE OF SACRED EDIFICES.]    [Illustration 42: THE VESICA PISCIS AND THE PLAN OF CHARTRES.]    At certain periods of the world's history, periods of mystical  enlightenment, men have been wont to use the human figure, the soul's  temple, as a sort of archetype for sacred edifices (Illustration 41).  The colossi, with calm inscrutable faces, which flank the entrance to  Egyptian temples; the great bronze Buddha of Japan, with its dreaming  eyes; the little known colossal figures of India and China--all these  belong scarcely less to the domain of architecture than of sculpture.  The relation above referred to however is a matter more subtle and  occult than mere obvious imitation on a large scale, being based upon  some correspondence of parts, or similarity of proportions, or both.  The correspondence between the innermost sanctuary or shrine of a  temple and the heart of a man, and between the gates of that temple  and the organs of sense is sufficiently obvious, and a relation once  established,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#9)"],[1," of all.\" At the  same time the Princess's tastes were opening out. Though she was still  passionately devoted to riding and dancing, she now began to have a  genuine love of music as well, and to drink in the roulades and arias  of the Italian opera with high enthusiasm. She even enjoyed reading  poetry--at any rate, the poetry of Sir Walter Scott.    When King Leopold learnt that King William's death was approaching, he  wrote several long letters of excellent advice to his niece. \"In every  letter I shall write to you,\" he said, \"I mean to repeat to you, as a  FUNDAMENTAL RULE, TO BE FIRM, AND COURAGEOUS, AND HONEST, AS YOU HAVE  BEEN TILL NOW.\" For the rest, in the crisis that was approaching, she  was not to be alarmed, but to trust in her \"good natural sense and the  TRUTH\" of her character; she was to do nothing in a hurry; to hurt  no one's amour-propre, and to continue her confidence in the Whig  administration! Not content with letters, however, King Leopold  determined that the Princess should not lack personal guidance, and sent  over to her aid the trusted friend whom, twenty years before, he had  taken to his heart by the death-bed at Claremont. Thus, once again, as  if in accordance with some preordained destiny, the figure of Stockmar  is discernible--inevitably present at a momentous hour.    On June 18, the King was visibly sinking. The Archbishop of Canterbury  was by his side, with all the comforts of the church. Nor did the holy  words fall upon a rebellious spirit; for many years his Majesty had  been a devout believer. \"When I was a young man,\" he once explained at  a public banquet, \"as well as I can remember, I believed in nothing but  pleasure and folly--nothing at all. But when I went to sea, got into  a gale, and saw the wonders of the mighty deep, then I believed; and I  have been a sincere Christian ever since.\" It was the anniversary of the  Battle of Waterloo, and the dying man remembered it. He should be glad  to live, he said, over that day; he would never see another sunset. \"I  hope your Majesty may live to see many,\" said Dr. Chambers. \"Oh! that's  quite another thing, that's quite another thing,\" was the answer. One  other sunset he did live to see; and he died in the early hours of the  following morning. It was on June 20, 1837.    When all was over, the Archbishop and the Lord Chamberlain ordered a  carriage, and drove post-haste from Windsor to Kensington. They arrived  at the Palace at five o'clock, and it was only with considerable  difficulty that they gained admittance. At six the Duchess woke up  her daughter, and told her that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord  Conyngham were there, and wished to see her. She got out of bed, put on  her dressing-gown, and went, alone, into the room where the messengers  were standing. Lord Conyngham fell on his knees, and officially  announced the death of the King; the Archbishop added some personal  details. Looking at the bending, murmuring dignitaries before her, she  knew that she was Queen of England. \"Since it has pleased Providence,\"  she wrote that day in her journal, \"to place me in this station, I shall  do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young, and  perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure,  that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what  is fit and right than I have.\" But there was scant time for resolutions  and reflections. At once, affairs were thick upon her. Stockmar came to  breakfast, and gave some good advice. She wrote a letter to her uncle  Leopold, and a hurried note to her sister Feodora. A letter came from  the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, announcing his approaching arrival.  He came at nine, in full court dress, and kissed her hand. She saw him  alone, and repeated to him the lesson which, no doubt, the faithful  Stockmar had taught her at breakfast. \"It has long been my intention to  retain your Lordship and the rest of the present Ministry at the head  of affairs;\" whereupon Lord Melbourne again kissed her hand and shortly  after left her. She then wrote a letter of condolence to Queen Adelaide.  At eleven, Lord Melbourne came again; and at half-past eleven she went  downstairs into the red saloon to hold her first Council. The great  assembly of lords and notables, bishops, generals, and Ministers of  State, saw the doors thrown open and a very short, very slim girl in  deep plain mourning come into the room alone and move forward to her  seat with extraordinary dignity and grace; they saw a countenance, not  beautiful, but prepossessing--fair hair, blue prominent eyes, a small  curved nose, an open mouth revealing the upper teeth, a tiny chin,  a clear complexion, and, over all, the strangely mingled signs of  innocence, of gravity, of youth, and of composure; they heard a high  unwavering voice reading aloud with perfect clarity; and then, the  ceremony was over, they saw the small figure rise and, with the same  consummate grace, the same amazing dignity, pass out from among them, as  she had come in, alone.        CHAPTER III. LORD MELBOURNE    I    The new queen was almost entirely unknown to her subjects. In her public  appearances her mother had invariably dominated the scene. Her private  life had been that of a novice in a convent: hardly a human being from  the outside world had ever spoken to her; and no human being at all,  except her mother and the Baroness Lehzen, had ever been alone with  her in a room. Thus it was not only the public at large that was in  ignorance of everything concerning her; the inner circles of statesmen  and officials and high-born ladies were equally in the dark. When she  suddenly emerged from this deep obscurity, the impression that she  created was immediate and profound. Her bearing at her first Council  filled the whole gathering with astonishment and admiration; the Duke of  Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, even the savage Croker, even the cold and  caustic Greville--all were completely carried away. Everything that was  reported of her subsequent proceedings seemed to be of no less happy  augury. Her perceptions were quick, her decisions were sensible, her  language was discreet; she performed her royal duties with extraordinary  facility. Among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm.  Sentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the spectacle of  the little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair and pink cheeks,  driving through her capital, filled the hearts of the beholders with  raptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all, struck everybody  with overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and  her uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and selfish, pig-headed and  ridiculous, with their perpetual burden of debts, confusions, and  disreputabilities--they had vanished like the snows of winter, and here  at last, crowned and radiant, was the spring. Lord John Russell, in an  elaborate oration, gave voice to the general sentiment. He hoped that  Victoria might prove an Elizabeth without her tyranny, an Anne without  her weakness. He asked England to pray that the illustrious Princess who  had just ascended the throne with the purest intentions and the justest  desires might see slavery abolished, crime diminished, and education  improved. He trusted that her people would henceforward derive their  strength, their conduct, and their loyalty from enlightened religious  and moral principles, and that, so fortified, the reign of Victoria  might prove celebrated to posterity and to all the nations of the earth.    Very soon, however, there were signs that the future might turn out to  be not quite so simple and roseate as a delighted public dreamed. The  \"illustrious Princess\" might perhaps, after all, have something within  her which squared ill with the easy vision of a well-conducted heroine  in an edifying story-book. The purest intentions and the justest  desires? No doubt; but was that all? To those who watched closely, for  instance, there might be something ominous in the curious contour  of that little mouth. When, after her first Council, she crossed the  ante-room and found her mother waiting for her, she said, \"And now,  Mamma, am I really and truly Queen?\" \"You see, my dear, that it is so.\"  \"Then, dear Mamma, I hope you will grant me the first request I make  to you, as Queen. Let me be by myself for an hour.\" For an hour she  remained in solitude. Then she reappeared, and gave a significant order:  her bed was to be moved out of her mother's room. It was the doom of the  Duchess of Kent. The long years of waiting were over at last; the moment  of a lifetime had come; her daughter was Queen of England; and that very  moment brought her own annihilation. She found herself, absolutely and  irretrievably, shut off from every vestige of influence, of confidence,  of power. She was surrounded, indeed, by all the outward signs of  respect and consideration; but that only made the inward truth of her  position the more intolerable. Through the mingled formalities of Court  etiquette and filial duty, she could never penetrate to Victoria. She  was unable to conceal her disappointment and her rage. \"Il n'y a plus  d'avenir pour moi,\" she exclaimed to Madame de Lieven; \"je ne suis plus  rien.\" For eighteen years, she said, this child had been the sole object  of her existence, of her thoughts, her hopes, and now--no! she would  not be comforted, she had lost everything, she was to the last degree  unhappy. Sailing, so gallantly and so pertinaciously, through the  buffeting storms of life, the stately vessel, with sails still swelling  and pennons flying, had put into harbour at last; to find there  nothing--a land of bleak desolation.    Within a month of the accession, the realities of the new situation  assumed a visible shape. The whole royal household moved from Kensington  to Buckingham Palace, and, in the new abode,"]]]
