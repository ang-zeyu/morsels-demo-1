It was used only in religious ceremonies, and  may be considered as the ancestor of the bell that is rung at  the elevation of the Host in Roman Catholic churches. Herodotus  (born 485 B.C.) tells us much about Egyptian music, how the  great festival at Bubastis in honour of the Egyptian Diana  (_Bast_ or _Pascht_), to whom the cat was sacred, was attended  yearly by 700,000 people who came by water, the boats resounding  with the clatter of castanets, the clapping of hands, and the  soft tones of thousands of flutes. Again he tells us of music  played during banquets, and speaks of a mournful song called  _Maneros_. This, the oldest song of the Egyptians (dating back  to the first dynasty), was symbolical of the passing away of  life, and was sung in connection with that gruesome custom  of bringing in, towards the end of a banquet, an effigy of a  corpse to remind the guests that death is the birthright of  all mankind, a custom which was adopted later by the Romans.    Herodotus also gives us a vague but very suggestive glimpse  of what may have been the genesis of Greek tragedy, for he was  permitted to see a kind of nocturnal Egyptian passion play, in  which evidently the tragedy of Osiris was enacted with ghastly  realism. Osiris, who represents the light, is hunted by Set or  Typhon, the god of darkness, and finally torn to pieces by the  followers of Set, and buried beneath the waters of the lake;  Horus, the son of Osiris, avenges his death by subduing Set, and  Osiris appears again as the ruler of the shadowland of death.    This strange tragedy took place at night, on the shore of  the lake behind the great temple at Sais. Osiris was dressed  royally, in white, and after the horrible pursuit and his  murder by Set and his sinister band, Horus, the rising sun,  dispels the gloom, and a glorious new god of light appears. Set  and his followers are driven back to the gloomy temple where,  perhaps, there was another scene showing the shade of Osiris,  enthroned and ruling the dead. We have no means of knowing the  character of the music which accompanied this mystery play;  but certainly the deep tones of the harps and the flutes,  together with the chanting of men's voices, must have been  appropriate. Add to these the almost silent rattle of the  sistrum, which, for the Egyptians, possessed something of the  supernatural, and we have an orchestral colouring which is  suggestive, to say the least.    With this we will leave Egyptian music, simply calling attention  to the works of Resellini, Lepsius, Wilkinson, and Petri,  which contain copies of mural paintings and temple and tomb  sculptures relating to music. For instance, pages 103, 106, and  111 of Lepsius's third book, \"Die Denkmaeler aus Aegypten und  Aethiopen,\" will be found very interesting, particularly page  106, which shows some of the rooms of the palace of Amenotep  IV, of the eighteenth dynasty (about 1500 or 1600 B.C.),  in which dancing and music is being taught. In the same work,  second book, on pages 52 and 53, are pictures taken from a tomb  near Gizeh, showing harp and flute players and singers. The  position of the hands of the singers--they hold them behind  their ears--is a manner of illustrating the act of hearing,  and arises from the hieroglyphic _double_ way of putting things;  for instance, in writing hieroglyphics the word is often first  spelled out, then comes another sign for the pronunciation,  then sometimes even two other signs to emphasize its meaning.    The music of the Assyrians may be summed up very briefly. All  that can be gathered from the bas-relief sculptures is that  shrill tones and acute pitch must have characterized their  music. As Rowbotham says, alluding to the Sardanapalus wall  sculpture now in the British Museum in London, \"What can one  think of the musical delicacy of a nation the King of which,  dining alone with his queen, chooses to be regaled with the  sounds of a lyre and a big drum close at his elbow?\" The  instruments represented in these bas-reliefs, aside from the  drum, are high-pitched: flutes, pipes, trumpets, cymbals, and  the smaller stringed instruments. These were all portable,  and some, such as drums and dulcimers, were strapped to the  body, all of which points to the eminently warlike character  of the people. Instead of clapping the hands to mark the time  as did the Egyptians, they stamped their feet. The dulcimer  was somewhat like a modern zither, and may be said to contain  the germ of our piano; for it was in the form of a flat case,  strapped to the body and held horizontally in front of the  player. The strings were struck with a kind of plectrum,  held in the right hand, and were touched with the left hand  immediately afterwards to stop the vibration, just as the  dampers in the pianoforte fall on the string the moment the  key is released. There existed among the Chaldeans a science  of music, which, of course, is a very different thing from  practical music, but it was so imbued with astronomical  symbolism that it seems hardly worth while to consider  it here. The art of Babylonia and Assyria culminated in  architecture and bas-relief sculpture, and it is chiefly  valuable as being the germ from which Greek art was developed.    In considering Chinese music one has somewhat the same feeling  as one would have in looking across a flat plain. There are no  mountains in Chinese music, and there is nothing in its history  to make us think that it was ever anything but a more or less  puerile playing with sound; therefore there is no separating  modern Chinese music from that of antiquity. To be sure,  Confucius (about 500 B.C.) said that to be well governed  a nation must possess good music. Pythagoras, Aristotle,  and Plato, in Greece, said the same thing, and their maxims  proved a very important factor in the music of ancient times,  for the simple reason that an art controlled by government can  have nothing very vital about it. Hebrew music was utterly  annihilated by laws, and the poetic imagination thus pent  up found its vent in poetry, the result being some of the  most wonderful works the world has ever known. In Egypt, this  current of inspiration from the very beginning was turned toward  architecture. In Greece, music became a mere stage accessory  or a subject for the dissecting table of mathematics; in China,  we have the dead level of an obstinate adherence to tradition,  thus proving Sir Thomas Browne's saying, \"The mortallest enemy  unto knowledge, and that which hath done the greatest execution  upon truth, hath been a peremptory adhesion unto tradition,  and more especially the establishing of our own belief upon  the dictates of antiquity.\"    The Chinese theory is that there are eight different musical  sounds in nature, namely:        1. The sound of skin.      2. The sound of stone.      3. The sound of metal.      4. The sound of clay.      5. The sound of silk.      6. The sound of wood.      7. The sound of bamboo.      8. The sound of gourd.    The sound of skin has a number of varieties, all different  kinds of drums.    The sound of stone is held by the Chinese to be the most  beautiful among sounds, one between that of metal and of  wood. The principal instrument in this category is the _king_,  and in mythology it is the chosen instrument of Kouei, the  Chinese Orpheus. This instrument has a large framework on which  are hung sixteen stones of different sizes, which are struck,  like drums, with a kind of hammer. According to Amiot, only  a certain kind of stone found near the banks of the river  Tee will serve for the making of these instruments, and in  the year 2200 B.C. the Emperor Yu assessed the different  provinces so many stones each for the palace instruments,  in place of tribute.    The sound of metal is embodied in the various kinds of bells,  which are arranged in many different series, sometimes after  the patterns of the _king_, while sometimes they are played  separately.    The sound of clay, or baked earth, is given by a kind of round  egg made of porcelain--for that is what it amounts to--pierced  with five holes and a mouthpiece, upon blowing through which  the sound is produced--an instrument somewhat suggestive of  our ocarina.    The sound of silk is given by two instruments: one a kind of  flat harp with seven strings, called _che_, the other with  twenty-five strings, called _kin_, in size from seven to nine  feet long. The ancient form of this instrument is said to have  had fifty strings.    The sound of wood is a strange element in a Chinese orchestra,  for it is produced in three different ways: first, by an  instrument in the form of a square wooden box with a hole in one  of its sides through which the hand, holding a small mallet,  is inserted, the sound of wood being produced by hammering  with the mallet on the inside walls of the box, just as the  clapper strikes a bell. This box is placed at the northeast  corner of the orchestra, and begins every piece. Second, by a  set of strips of wood strung on a strap or cord, the sound of  which is obtained by beating the palm of the hand with them.  The third is the strangest of all, for the instrument consists  of a life-size wooden tiger. It has a number of teeth or pegs  along the ridge of its back, and it is \"played\" by stroking  these pegs rapidly with a wooden staff, and then striking the  tiger on the head. This is the prescribed end of every Chinese  orchestral composition, and is supposed to be a symbol of man's  supremacy over brute creation. The tiger has its place in the  northwest corner of the orchestra.    The sound of bamboo is represented in the familiar form of  Pan's pipes, and various forms of flutes which hardly need  further description.    And finally the sound of the gourd. The gourd is a kind of  squash, hollowed out, in which from thirteen to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#9)"],[1,"and  a dozen cigaras.

No; I never smoke them now  since my brother's son Job died.  And I'll tell you how it came.    \"It was at the great fair where the horses run (_i.e_., the races), I was  keeping a cock-shy, and I saw a gentleman, and asked him for a drop of  ale.  'Yes,' he said, 'I'll give you ale, and a good smoke too.'  'Thank  you,' says I, 'Sir.'  So he gave me the ale, and a dozen cigars.  I put  them in my pocket, and went on the road and found there my brother's son,  and he asked me, 'Where (are) you going, uncle?'  And I said: 'Job, I  have something for you.'  'Good,' says he--so I gave him the cigars.  He  said: 'Where did you find them?'  'A gentleman gave them to me.'  So he  put them in his pocket, and asked me, 'What'll you take to drink?'  'A  drop of ale.'  So he said, 'After the horses (have) run I'll go across  the field and see you.'    \"Eight or nine days after, at Hampton Court, {53} his 'pal' came to me  and told me that Job was ill.  And I said, 'Anything wrong?' 'Worse nor  that.'  'What _is_ the affair?'  Said he, 'I want you to go to my  pal,--don't spare the horse--let her go!'  So he gave me a fine horse,  and I rode eight miles so fast that I thought I'd killed her.  And I put  her in the stable, and I went down into the field, and there I saw Job.  'Thank God!' said he; 'Uncle, you've come here; and if I get over this  small-pox (for 'twas the smallpox he'd caught), I'll give you the best  horse that you'll beat all the Gipsies.'  But he died.    \"And he says as he was dying, 'Uncle, you know the cigars you gave me?'  'Yes.'  Says he, 'I've got 'em here in my pocket.'  I and my sisters were  by him, but his wife was outside in the great tent, selling things, for  she never had the smallpox, nor his children, so they couldn't come to  see, for we wouldn't let them.  And so he died.    \"And when he was dead, I put my hand in his pocket, and there I found the  cigars.  And from that time, Sir, I never smoked a cigar.    \"Yes! there are plenty of Gipsies who do that.  And when my wife died, I  never took snuff again.  Sometimes in her life she'd take a bit of snuff  out (from) my box; and when I'd say, 'Dear wife, what do you do that  for?' she'd tell me, 'It's good for my head.'  And so when she died I  never took any (none) since.    \"Some men won't eat meat because the brother or sister that died was fond  of (to) it; some won't drink ale for five or ten years; some won't eat  the favourite fish that the child ate.  Some won't eat potatoes, or drink  milk, or eat apples; and all for the dead.    \"Some won't play cards or the fiddle--'that's my poor boy's tune'--and  some won't dance--'No, I can't dance, the last time I danced was with my  poor wife (or girl) that's been dead this four years.'    \"'Come, brother, let's go and have a drop of ale; the fiddler is there.'  'No, brother, I never drank a drop of ale since my aunt went (died).'  'Well, take some tobacco, brother?'  'No, no, I have not smoked since my  wife fell in the water and never came out again alive.'  'Well, let's go  and play at cock-shy, we two'll play you two for a pint o' ale.'  'No, I  never played at cock-shy since my father died; the last time I played was  with him.'    \"And Lena, the wife of my nephew Job, never ate plums after her husband  died.\"    This is a strange manner of mourning, but it is more effective than the  mere wearing of black, since it is often a long-sustained and trying  tribute to the dead.  Its Oriental-Indian origin is apparent enough.  But  among the German Gipsies, who, I am firmly convinced, represent in  language and customs their English brethren as the latter were three  centuries ago, this reverence for the departed assumes an even deeper and  more serious character.  Mr Richard Liebich (_Die Zigeuner_, _Leipzig_,  1863), tells us that in his country their most sacred oath is _Ap i  mulende_!--by the dead!--and with it may be classed the equally  patriarchal imprecation, \"By my father's hand!\"    Since writing the foregoing sentence a very remarkable confirmation of  the existence of this oath among English Gipsies, and the sacredness with  which it is observed, came under my own observation.  An elderly Gipsy,  during the course of a family difficulty, declared to his sister that he  would leave the house.  She did not believe he would until he swore by  his dead wife--by his \"_mullo juvo_.\"  And when he had said this, his  sister promptly remarked: \"Now you have sworn by her, I know you will do  it.\"  He narrated this to me the next day, adding that he was going to  put a tent up, about a mile away, and live there.  I asked him if he ever  swore by his dead father, to which he said: \"Always, until my wife died.\"  This poor man was almost entirely ignorant of what was in the Bible, as I  found by questioning him; but I doubt whether I know any Christian on  whom a Bible oath would be more binding than was to him his own by the  dead.  To me there was something deeply moving in the simple earnestness  and strangeness of this adjuration.    The German, like the older English Gipsies, carefully burn the clothes  and bed of the deceased, and, indeed, most objects closely connected with  them, and what is more extraordinary, evince their respect by carefully  avoiding mentioning their names, even when they are borne by other  persons or are characteristic of certain things.  So that when a Gipsy  maiden named Forella once died, her entire nation, among whom the trout  had always been known only by its German designation, Forelle, at once  changed the name, and, to this day it is called by them _mulo  madscho_--the dead fish,--or at times _lolo madscho_--the red fish.    This is also the case among the English Gipsies.  Wishing to have the  exact words and views of a real Rommany on this subject, I made inquiry,  and noted down his reply, which was literally as follows:--    \"Avali; when Rommany chals or juvos are mullos, their pals don't kaum to  shoon their navs pauli--it kairs 'em too bongo--so they're purabend to  waver navs.  Saw don't kair it--kek--but posh do, kenna.  My chavo's nav  was Horfer or Horferus, but the bitti chavis penned him Wacker.  Well,  yeck divvus pre the wellgooro o' the graias prasters, my juvo dicked a  boro _doll_ adree some hev of a buttika and penned, 'Dovo odoi dicks just  like moro Wacker!'  So we penned him _Wackerdoll_, but a'ter my juvo  mullered I rakkered him Wacker again, because Wackerdoll pet mandy in  cammoben o' my poor juvo.\"    In English: \"Yes.  When Gipsy men or women die, their friends don't care  to hear their names again--it makes them too sad, so they are changed to  other names.  All don't do it--no--but half of them do so still.  My  boy's name was Horfer or Horferus (Orpheus), but "]]]
