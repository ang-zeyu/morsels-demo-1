Captain Vanselow, Chief of the Admiralty  Intelligence Department, was there and had brought with him the  Manchester _Guardian_.  He asked me where I got the information and who  had passed the despatch.  He said the Navy was up in arms and had  issued orders to the General Telegraph Office that, inasmuch as Germany  was under martial law, no telegrams were to be passed containing the  words submarines, navy, admiralty or marine or any officers of the Navy  without having them referred to the Admiralty for a second censoring.  This order practically nullified the censorship powers of the Foreign  Office.  I saw that the Navy Department was again in the saddle and  that the efforts of the Chancellor to maintain peace might not be  successful after all.  But the conferences at Great Headquarters lasted  longer than any one expected.  The first news we received of what had  taken place was that Secretary von Jagow had informed the Kaiser he  would resign before he would do anything which might cause trouble with  the United States.    Germany was split wide open by the submarine issue.  For a while it  looked as if the only possible adjustment would be either for von  Tirpitz to go and his policies with him, or for von Jagow and the  Chancellor to go with the corresponding danger of a rupture with  America.  But von Tirpitz would not resign.  He left Great Headquarters  for Berlin and intimated to his friends that he was going to run the  Navy to suit himself.  But the Chancellor who had the support of the  big shipping interests and the financiers, saw a possible means of  checkmating von Tirpitz by forcing Admiral von Pohl to resign as Chief  of the Admiralty Staff.  They finally persuaded the Kaiser to accept  his resignation and appoint Admiral von Holtzendorff as his successor.  Von Holtzendorff's brother was a director of the Hamburg-American Line  and an intimate friend of A. Ballin, the General Director of the  company.  The Chancellor believed that by having a friend of his as  Chief of the Admiralty Staff, no orders would be issued to submarine  commanders contrary to the wishes of the Chancellor, because according  to the rules of the German Navy Department the Chief of the Admiralty  Staff must approve all naval plans and sign all orders to fleet  commanders.    Throughout this time the one thing which frightened the Foreign Office  was the fear that President Wilson might break off diplomatic relations  before the Foreign Office had an opportunity to settle the differences  with the United States.  For this reason Ambassador Gerard was kept  advised by Wilhelmstrasse of the internal developments in Germany and  asked to report them fully but confidentially to Wilson.  So, during  this crisis when Americans were demanding a break with Germany because  of Germany's continued defiance of President Wilson's notes, the  American Government knew that if the Foreign Office was given more time  it had a good chance of succeeding in cleaning house.  A rupture at  that time would have destroyed all the efforts of the Foreign Office to  keep the German military machine within bounds.  It would have  over-thrown von Jagow and von Bethmann-Hollweg and put in von Tirpitz  as Chancellor and von Heydebrand, the reactionary leader of the  Prussian Diet, as Secretary of State.  At that time, all the democratic  forces of Germany were lined up with the Foreign Office.  The people  who blushed for Belgium, the financiers who were losing money, the  shipping interests whose tonnage was locked in belligerent or neutral  harbours, the Socialists and people who were anxious and praying for  peace, were looking to the Foreign Office and to Washington to avoid a  break.          CHAPTER IV    THE HATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AMERICA    While Germany was professing her friendship for the United States in  every note written following the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the  government was secretly preparing the nation for a break in diplomatic  relations, or for war, in the event of a rupture.  German officials  realised that unless the people were made to suspect Mr. Wilson and his  motives, unless they were made to resent the shipment of arms and  ammunition to the Allies, there would be a division in public opinion  and the government would not be able to count upon the united support  of the people.  Because the government does the thinking for the people  it has to tell them what to think before they have reached the point of  debating an issue themselves.  A war with America or a break in  diplomatic relations in 1915 would not have been an easy matter to  explain, if the people had not been encouraged to hate Wilson.  So  while Germany maintained a propaganda bureau in America to interpret  Germany and to maintain good relations, she started in Germany an  extensive propaganda against Wilson, the American press, the United  States Ambassador and Americans in general.    This step was not necessary in the army because among army officers the  bitterness and hatred of the United States were deeper and more  extensive than the hatred of any other belligerent.  It was hardly ever  possible for the American correspondents to go to the front without  being insulted.  Even the American military attaches, when they went to  the front, had to submit to the insults of army officers.  After the  sinking of the _Arabic_ the six military observers attached to the  American Embassy were invited by the General Staff to go to Russia to  study the military operations of Field Marshal von Mackensen.  They  were escorted by Baron von Maltzahn, former attache of the German  Embassy in Paris.  At Lodz, one of the largest cities in Poland, they  were taken to headquarters.  Von Maltzahn, who knew Mackensen  personally, called at the Field Marshal's offices, reported that he had  escorted six American army officers under orders of the General Staff,  whom he desired to present to the Commander-in-Chief.  Von Mackensen  replied that he did not care to meet the Americans and told von  Maltzahn that the best thing he could do would be to escort the  observers back to Berlin.    As soon as the military attaches reached Berlin and reported this to  Washington they were recalled.         *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *      BLOOD-TRAFFICKERS      Cowards, who kill three thousand miles away,    See the long lines of shrouded forms increase!    Yours is this work, disguise it as you may;    But for your greed the world were now at peace.      Month after month your countless chimneys roar,--    Slaughter your object, and your motive gain;    Look at your money,--it is wet with gore    Nothing can cleanse it from the loathsome stain.      You, who prolong this hideous hell on earth,    Making a by-word of your native land,    Stripped of your wealth, how paltry is your worth!    See how men shrink from contact with your hand!      There is pollution in your blood-smeared gold,    There is corruption in your pact with Death,    There is dishonor in the lie, oft-told,    Of your \"Humanity\"!  'Tis empty breath.      What shall it profit you to heap on high,    Makers of orphans! a few millions more,    When you must face them--those you caused to die,    And God demands of you to pay your score?      He is not mocked; His vengeance doth not sleep;    His cup of wrath He lets you slowly fill;    What you have sown, that also shall you reap;    God's law is adamant,--\"Thou shalt not kill\"!      Think not to plead:--\"I did not act alone,\"    \"Custom allows it,\" and \"My dead were few\";    Each hath his quota; yonder are your own!    See how their fleshless fingers point at you, at you!      You, to whose vaults this wholesale murder yields    Mere needless increments of ghoulish gain,    Count up your corpses on these blood-soaked fields!    Hear . . . till your death . . . your victims' moans of pain!      Then, when at night you, sleepless, fear to pray,    Watch the thick, crimson stream draw near your bed,    And shriek with horror, till the dawn of day    Shall find you raving at your heaps of dead!

After the fall of Warsaw  a group of American correspondents were asked to go to the headquarters  of General von Besseler, afterward named Governor General of Poland.  The general received them in the gardens of the Polish castle which he  had seized as his headquarters; shook hands with the Dutch, Danish,  Swedish, Swiss and South American newspaper men, and then, before  turning on his heels to go back to his Polish palace, turned to the  Americans and said:    \"As for you gentlemen, the best thing you can do is to tell your  country to stop shipping arms and ammunition.\"    During General Brusiloff's offensive I was invited together with other  correspondents to go to the Wohlynian battlefields to see how the  Germans had reorganised the Austrian front.  In a little town near the  Stochod River we were invited to dinner by Colonel von Luck.  I sat  opposite the colonel, who was in charge of the reorganisation here.  Throughout the meal he made so many insulting remarks that the officer  who was our escort had to change the trend of the conversation.  Before  he did so the colonel said:    \"Tell me, do they insult you in Berlin like this?\"    I replied that I seldom encountered such antagonism in Berlin; that it  was chiefly the army which was anti-American.    \"Well, that's the difference between the diplomats and the army.

Indeed this sudden transition from  warm, mild weather, to extreme cold and wet, made every man in the ship  feel its effects. For by this time the mercury in the thermometer had  fallen to 38; whereas at the Cape it was generally at 67 and upwards. I now  made some addition to the people's allowance of spirit, by giving them a  dram whenever I thought it necessary, and ordered Captain Furneaux to do  the same. The night proved clear and serene, and the only one that was so  since we left the Cape; and the next morning the rising sun gave us such  flattering hopes of a fine day, that we were induced to let all the reefs  out of the top-sails, and to get top-gallant yards across, in order to make  the most of a fresh gale at north. Our hopes, however, soon vanished; for  before eight o'clock, the serenity of the sky was changed into a thick  haze, accompanied with rain. The gale increasing obliged us to hand the  main-sail, close-reef our top-sails, and to strike top-gallant yards. The  barometer at this time was unusually low, which foreboded an approaching  storm, and this happened accordingly. For, by one o'clock p. m. the wind,  which was at N.W., blew with such strength as obliged us to take in all our  sails, to strike top-gallant-masts, and to get the spritsail-yard in. And I  thought proper to wear, and lie-to, under a mizzen-stay-sail, with the  ships' heads to the N.E. as they would bow the sea, which ran prodigiously  high, better on this tack.    At eight o'clock next morning, being the 8th, we wore, and lay on the other  tack; the gale was a little abated, but the sea ran too high to make sail,  any more than the fore-top-mast-stay-sail. In the evening, being in the  latitude of 49 deg. 40 S., and 1-1/2 deg. E. of the Cape, we saw two penguins and  some sea or rock-weed, which occasioned us to sound, without finding ground  at 100 fathoms. At eight p. m. we wore, and lay with our heads to the N.E.  till three in the morning of the 9th, then wore again to the southward, the  wind blowing in squalls attended with showers of snow. At eight, being  something more moderate, I made the Adventure signal to make sail; and soon  after made sail ourselves under the courses and close-reefed top-sails. In  the evening, took in the top-sails and main-sail, and brought-to under  fore-sail and mizzen; thermometer at 36 deg.. The wind still at N.W. blew a  fresh gale, accompanied with a very high sea. In the night had a pretty  smart frost with snow.    In the morning of the 10th we made sail under courses and top-sails close-  reefed; and made the signal for the Adventure to make sail and lead. At  eight o'clock saw an island of ice to the westward of us, being then in the  latitude of 56 deg. 40' S. and longitude 2 deg. 0' E. of the Cape of Good Hope.  Soon after the wind moderated, and we let all the reefs out of the top-  sails, got the spritsail-yard out, and top-gallant-mast up. The weather  coming hazy, I called the Adventure by signal under my stern, which was no  sooner done, than the haze increased so much with snow and sleet, that we  did not see an island of ice, which we were steering directly for, till we  were less than a mile from it. I judged it to be about 50 feet high, and  half a mile in circuit. It was flat at top, and its sides rose in a  perpendicular direction, against which the sea broke exceedingly high.  Captain Furneaux at first took this ice for land, and hauled off from it,  until called back by signal. As the weather was foggy, it was necessary to  proceed with caution. We therefore reefed our top-sails, and at the same  time sounded, but found no ground with 150 fathoms. We kept on to the  southward with the wind at north till night, which we spent in making short  trips, first one way and then another, under an easy sail; thermometer  these 24 hours from 36-1/2 to 31.    At day-light in the morning of the 11th, we made sail to the southward with  the wind at west, having a fresh gale, attended with sleet and snow. At  noon we were in the latitude of 51 deg. 50' S., and longitude 21 deg. 3' E., where  we saw some white birds about the size of pigeons, with blackish bills and  feet. I never saw any such before; and Mr Forster had no knowledge of them.  I believe them to be of the peterel tribe, and natives of these icy  seas. At this time we passed between two ice islands, which lay at a  little distance from each other.    In the night the wind veered to N.W. which enabled us to steer S.W. On the  12th we had still thick hazy weather, with sleet and snow; so that we were  obliged to proceed with great caution on account of the ice islands. Six of  these we passed this day; some of them near two miles in circuit, and sixty  feet high. And yet, such was the force and height of the waves, that the  sea broke quite over them. This exhibited a view which for a few moments  was pleasing to the eye; but when we reflected on the danger, the mind was  filled with horror. For were a ship to get against the weather-side of one  of these islands when the sea runs high, she would be dashed to pieces in a  moment. Upon our getting among the ice islands, the albatrosses left us;  that is, we saw but one now and then. Nor did our other companions, the  pintadoes, sheerwaters, small grey birds, fulmars, &c., appear in such  numbers; on the other hand, penguins began to make their appearance. Two of  these birds were seen to-day.    The wind in the night veered to west, and at last fixed at S.W., a fresh  gale, with sleet and snow, which froze on our sails and rigging as it fell,  so that they were all hung with icicles. We kept on to the southward,  passed no less than eighteen ice islands, and saw more penguins. At noon on  the 13th, we were in the latitude of 54 deg. S., which is the latitude of Cape  Circumcision, discovered by M. Bouvet in 1739; but we were ten degrees of  longitude east of it; that is, near 118 leagues in this latitude. We stood  on to the S.S.E. till eight o'clock in the evening, the weather still  continuing thick and hazy, with sleet and snow. From noon till this time,  twenty ice islands, of various extent, both for height and circuit,  presented themselves to our view. At eight o'clock we sounded, but found no  ground with 150 fathom of line.    We now tacked and made a trip to the northward till midnight, when we stood  again to the southward; and at half an hour past six o'clock in the morning  of the 14th, we were stopped by an immense field of low ice; to which we  could see no end, either to the east, west, or south. In different parts of  this field were islands or hills of ice, like those we found floating in  the sea; and some on board thought they saw land also over the ice, bearing  S.W. by S. I even thought so myself; but changed my opinion upon more  narrowly examining these ice hills, and the various appearances they made  when seen through the haze. For at this time it was both hazy and cloudy in  the horizon; so that a distant object could not be seen distinct. Being  now in the latitude of 54 deg. 50' S. and longitude 21 deg. 34' E., and having the  wind at N.W. we bore away along the edge of the ice, steering S.S.E. and  S.E., according to the direction of the north side of it, where we saw many  whales, penguins, some white birds, pintadoes, &c.    At eight o'clock we brought-to under a point of the ice, where we had  smooth water: and I sent on board for Captain Furneaux. After we had fixed  on rendezvouses in case of separation, and some other matters for the  better keeping company, he returned on board, and we made sail again along  the ice. Some pieces we took up along-side, which yielded fresh water. At  noon we had a good observation, and found ourselves in latitude 54 deg. 55' S.    We continued a south-east course along the edge of the ice, till one  o'clock, when we came to a point round which we hauled S.S.W., the sea  appearing to be clear of ice in that direction. But after running four  leagues upon this course, with the ice on our starboard side, we found  ourselves quite imbayed; the ice extending from N.N.E. round by the west  and south, to east, in one compact body. The weather was indifferently  clear; and yet we could see no end to it. At five o'clock we hauled up  east, wind at north, a gentle gale, in order to clear the ice. The extreme  east point of it, at eight o'clock, bore E. by S., over which appeared a  clear sea. We however spent the night in making short boards, under an easy  sail. Thermometer, these 24 hours, from 32 to 30.    Next day, the 15th, we had the wind at N.W., a small gale, thick foggy  weather, with much snow; thermometer from 32 to 27; so that our sails and  rigging were all hung with icicles. The fog was so thick at times, that we  could not see the length of the ship; and we had much difficulty to avoid  the many islands of ice that surrounded us. About noon, having but little  wind, we hoisted out a boat to try the current, which we found set S.E.  near 3/4 of a mile an hour. At the same time, a thermometer, which in the  open air was at 32 deg., in the surface of the sea was at 30 deg.; and, after being  immerged 100 fathoms deep for about fifteen or twenty minutes, came up at  34 deg., which is only 2 deg. above freezing. Our latitude at this time was 55 deg.  8'.    The thick fog continued till two o'clock in the afternoon of the next day,  when it cleared away a little, and we made sail to the southward, wind  still at N.W. a gentle gale. We had not run long to the southward before we  fell in with the main field of ice extending from S.S.W. to E. We now bore  away to east along the edge of it; but at night hauled off north, with the  wind at W.N.W., a gentle gale, attended with snow.    At four in the morning on the 17th, stood again to the south; but was again  obliged to bear up on account of the ice, along the side of which we  steered betwixt E. and S.S.W., hauling into every bay or opening, "]]]
