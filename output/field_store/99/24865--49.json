[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14080"],[0,"Custom and Myth (#9)"],[1," The other children also emerged, all alive  and well.  Zeus fixed the stone at Delphi, where, long after the  Christian era, Pausanias saw it. {52b}  It was not a large stone,  Pausanias tells us, and the Delphians used to anoint it with oil and wrap  it up in wool on feast-days.  All Greek temples had their fetich-stones,  and each stone had its legend.  This was the story of the Delphian stone,  and of the fetichism which survived the early years of Christianity.  A  very pretty story it is.  Savages more frequently smear their  fetich-stones with red paint than daub them with oil, but the latter, as  we learn from Theophrastus's account of the 'superstitious man,' was the  Greek ritual.    * * * * *    This anecdote about Cronus was the stumbling-block of the orthodox Greek,  the jest of the sceptic, and the butt of the early Christian  controversialists.  Found among Bushmen or Australians the narrative  might seem rather wild, but it astonishes us still more when it occurs in  the holy legends of Greece.  Our explanation of its presence there is  simple enough.  Like the erratic blocks in a modern plain, like the flint-  heads in a meadow, the story is a relic of a very distant past.  The  glacial age left the boulders on the plain, the savage tribes of long ago  left the arrowheads, the period of savage fancy left the story of Cronus  and the rites of the fetich-stone.  Similar rites are still notoriously  practised in the South Sea Islands, in Siberia, in India and Africa and  Melanesia, by savages.  And by savages similar tales are still told.    * * * * *    We cannot go much lower than the Bushmen, and among Bushman divine myths  is room for the 'swallowing trick' attributed to Cronus by Hesiod.  The  chief divine character in Bushman myth is the Mantis insect.  His adopted  daughter is the child of Kwai Hemm, a supernatural character, 'the all-  devourer.'  The Mantis gets his adopted daughter to call the swallower to  his aid; but Kwai Hemm swallows the Mantis, the god-insect.  As Zeus made  his own wife change herself into an insect, for the convenience of  swallowing her, there is not much difference between Bushman and early  Greek mythology.  Kwai Hemm is killed by a stratagem, and all the animals  whom he has got outside of, in a long and voracious career, troop forth  from him alive and well, like the swallowed gods from the maw of Cronus.  {54a}  Now, story for story, the Bushman version is much less offensive  than that of Hesiod.  But the Bushman story is just the sort of story we  expect from Bushmen, whereas the Hesiodic story is not at all the kind of  tale we look for from Greeks.  The explanation is, that the Greeks had  advanced out of a savage state of mind and society, but had retained  their old myths, myths evolved in the savage stage, and in harmony with  that condition of fancy.  Among the Kaffirs {54b} we find the same  'swallow-myth.'  The Igongqongqo swallows all and sundry; a woman cuts  the swallower with a knife, and 'people came out, and cattle, and dogs.'  In Australia, a god is swallowed.  As in the myth preserved by  Aristophanes in the 'Birds,' the Australians believe that birds were the  original gods, and the eagle, especially, is a great creative power.  The  Moon was a mischievous being, who walked about the world, doing what evil  he could.  One day he swallowed the eagle-god.  The wives of the eagle  came up, and the Moon asked them where he might find a well.  They  pointed out a well, and, as he drank, they hit the Moon with a stone  tomahawk, and out flew the eagle. {54c}  This is oddly like Grimm's tale  of 'The Wolf and the Kids.'  The wolf swallowed the kids, their mother  cut a hole in the wolf, let out the kids, stuffed the wolf with stones,  and sewed him up again.  The wolf went to the well to drink, the weight  of the stones pulled him in, and he was drowned.  Similar stories are  common among the Red Indians, and Mr. Im Thurn has found them in Guiana.  How savages all over the world got the idea that men and beasts could be  swallowed and disgorged alive, and why they fashioned the idea into a  divine myth, it is hard to say.  Mr. Tylor, in 'Primitive Culture,' {55a}  adds many examples of the narrative.  The Basutos have it; it occurs some  five times in Callaway's 'Zulu Nursery Tales.'  In Greenland the Eskimo  have a shape of the incident, and we have all heard of the escape of  Jonah.    It has been suggested that night, covering up the world, gave the first  idea of the swallowing myth.  Now in some of the stories the night is  obviously conceived of as a big beast which swallows all things.  The  notion that night is an animal is entirely in harmony with savage  metaphysics.  In the opinion of the savage speculator, all things are men  and animals.  'Ils se persuadent que non seulement les hommes et les  autres animaux, mais aussi que toutes les autres choses sont animees,'  says one of the old Jesuit missionaries in Canada. {55b}  'The wind was  formerly a person; he became a bird,' say the Bushmen.    G' oo ka! Kui (a very respectable Bushman, whose name seems a little hard  to pronounce), once saw the wind-person at Haarfontein.  Savages, then,  are persuaded that night, sky, cloud, fire, and so forth, are only the  schein, or sensuous appearance, of things that, in essence, are men or  animals.  A good example is the bringing of Night to Vanua Lava, by Qat,  the 'culture-hero' of Melanesia.  At first it was always day, and people  tired of it.  Qat heard that Night was at the Torres Islands, and he set  forth to get some.  Qong (Night) received Qat well, blackened his  eyebrows, showed him Sleep, and sent him off with fowls to bring Dawn  after the arrival of Night should make Dawn a necessary.  Next day Qat's  brothers saw the sun crawl away west, and presently Night came creeping  up from the sea.  'What is this?' cried the brothers.  'It is Night,'  said Qat; 'sit down, and when you feel something in your eyes, lie down  and keep quiet.'  So they went to sleep.  'When Night had lasted long  enough, Qat took a piece of red obsidian, and cut the darkness, and the  Dawn came out.' {56}    Night is more or less personal in this tale, and solid enough to be cut,  so as to let the Dawn out.  This savage conception of night, as the  swallower and disgorger, might start the notion of other swallowing and  disgorging beings.  Again the Bushmen, and other savage peoples, account  for certain celestial phenomena by saying that 'a big star has swallowed  his daughter, and spit her out again.'  While natural phenomena,  explained on savage principles, might give the data of the swallow-myth,  we must not conclude that all beings to whom the story is attached are,  therefore, the Night.  On this principle Cronus would be the Night, and  so would the wolf in Grimm.  For our purposes it is enough that the feat  of Cronus is a feat congenial to the savage fancy and repugnant to the  civilised Greeks who found themselves in possession of the myth.  Beyond  this, and beyond the inference that the Cronus myth was first evolved by  people to whom it seemed quite natural, that is, by savages, we do not  pretend to go in our interpretation.    * * * * *    To end our examination of the Myth of Cronus, we may compare the  solutions offered by scholars.  As a rule, these solutions are based on  the philological analysis of the names in the story.  It will be seen  that very various and absolutely inconsistent etymologies and meanings of  Cronus are suggested by philologists of the highest authority.  These  contradictions are, unfortunately, rather the rule than the exception in  the etymological interpretation of myths.    * * * * *    The opinion of Mr. Max Muller has always a right to the first hearing  from English inquirers.  Mr. Muller, naturally, examines first the name  of the god whose legend he is investigating.  He writes: 'There is no  such being as Kronos in Sanskrit.  Kronos did not exist till long after  Zeus in Greece.  Zeus was called by the Greeks the son of Time ([Greek]).  This is a very simple and very common form of mythological expression.  It  meant originally, not that time was the origin or source of Zeus, but  [Greek] or [Greek] was used in the sense of \"connected with time,  representing time, existing through all time.\"  Derivatives in -[Greek]  and -[Greek] took, in later times, the more exclusive meaning of  patronymics. . . .  When this (the meaning of [Greek] as equivalent to  Ancient of Days) ceased to be understood, . . . people asked themselves  the question, Why is Zeus called [Greek]?  And the natural and almost  inevitable answer was, Because he is the son, the offspring of a more  ancient god, Kronos.  This may be a very old myth in Greece; but the  misunderstanding which gave rise to it could have happened in Greece  only.  We cannot expect, therefore, a god Kronos in the Veda.'  To expect  Greek in the Veda would certainly be sanguine.  'When this myth of Kronos  had once been started, it would roll on irresistibly.  If Zeus had once a  father called Kronos, Kronos must have a wife.'  It is added, as  confirmation, that 'the name of [Greek] belongs originally to Zeus only,  and not to his later' (in Hesiod elder) 'brothers, Poseidon and Hades.'  {58a}    Mr. Muller says, in his famous essay on 'Comparative Mythology' {58b}:  'How can we imagine that a few generations before that time' (the age of  Solon) 'the highest notions of the Godhead among the Greeks were  adequately expressed by the story of Uranos maimed by Kronos,--of Kronos  eating his children, swallowing a stone, and vomiting out alive his whole  progeny.  Among the lowest tribes of Africa and America, we hardly find  anything more hideous and revolting.'  We have found a good deal of the  sort in Africa and America, where it seems not out of place.    One objection to Mr. Muller's theory is, that it makes the mystery no  clearer.  When Greeks were so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#9)"],[1,"of giving  expression to the faculties and powers they possess, and which they  desire to make the most of. It is incumbent that they do all in their  power for their own and other people's good. Feeling this, an ever  present incentive keeps them employed, and they are never idle.    [Illustration]    If one does not succeed from persisting in doing the best he knows  how, he may conclude that the ministry of failure is better for him  than any worldly success would be.      CIVILITY.    Good behavior is an essential element of our civilization. It should  be displayed every day through courteous acts and becoming manners.    Politeness is said to be the poetry of conduct; and like poetry, it  has many qualities. Let not your politeness he too florid, but of that  gentle kind which indicates a refined nature.      In his relations with others, one should never forget his good  breeding. It is a general regard for the feelings of others that  springs from the absence of all selfishness. No one should behave  in the presence of others as though his own wishes were bound to be  gratified or his will to control.    [Illustration]    In the more active sphere of business, as in the larger localities  where there is close competition, the small merchant frequently  outstrips his more powerful rival by one element of success, which  may be added to any stock without cost, but cannot be withheld without  loss. That element is civility. A kind and obliging manner carries  with it an indescribable charm. It must not be a manner that indicates  a mean, groveling, timeserving spirit, but a plain, open, and  agreeable demeanor that seems to desire to oblige for the pleasure of  doing so, and not for the sake of squeezing an extra penny out of a  customer's purse.      INTEGRITY.    The sole reliance of a business man should be in the integrity of his  transactions, and in the civility of his demeanor. He should make it  the interest and the pleasure of a customer to come to his office or  store. If he does this, he will form the very best \"connections,\"  and so long as he continues this system of business, they will never  desert him.    No real business man will take advantage of a customer's ignorance,  nor equivocate nor misrepresent. If he sells goods, he will have  but one price and a small profit. He will ere long find all the most  profitable customers--the cash ones--or they will find him.    If such a man is ever deceived in business transactions, he will never  attempt to save himself by putting the deception upon others; but  submit to the loss, and be more cautious in future. In his business  relations, he will stick to those whom he finds strictly just in their  transactions, and shun all others even at a temporary disadvantage.    The word of a business man should be worth all that it expresses and  promises, and all engagements should be met with punctilious concern.  An indifferent or false policy in business is a serious mistake. It  is fatal to grasp an advantage at ten times its cost; and there is  nothing to compensate for the loss of a neighbor's confidence or good  will.    The long-established customs and forms of business, which in these  times are assumed to be legitimate, already have within them enough of  the elements of peculiarity, commonly termed \"tricks of trade,\" or, in  the sense of any particular business, \"tricks of the trade.\" Therefore  it does not behoove any active man to make gratuitous additions of a  peculiar nature to the law of business. On the contrary, all should  strive to render business transactions less peculiar than they are.      ECONOMY.    One may rest in the assurance that industry and economy will be sure  to tell in the end. If in early life these habits become confirmed,  no doubt can exist as to the ultimate triumph of the merchant in  attaining a competency.    There should be no antagonism between economy and a generous business  policy. Narrow selfishness is to be avoided in the use of money or  means. In buying goods, one should not take advantage of another's  necessities to beat him down to a figure which leaves him little or no  profit, perhaps a loss, because he must have money. This is against  manhood and is a ruinous policy, because it tends to picayunishness and  chicanery. A sacred regard for the principles of justice forms the basis  of every transaction, and regulates the conduct of the upright man of  business.    [Illustration]    If economy is wealth, it is not so because of a niggardly and  parsimonious policy. Perhaps the simplest, fewest and best rules for  economical business are these, by observance of which a noted  merchant amassed a large fortune: 1. Obtain the earliest and fullest  information possible in regard to the matter in hand. 2. Act rapidly  and promptly upon it. 3. Keep your intentions and means secret.  4. Secure the best [Transcriber's Note: The original text reads  'employes'] employees you can obtain, and reward them liberally.    Proprietors of institutions will early discover that order, and  neatness, are necessary as economical agents in prosecuting a  successful business. And the youth who would grow up to become  well-to-do, to gain complete success, to be a valuable member and  assume a position in society, should take pains to acquire habits of  cleanliness, of order, and of business.    To this effect each one may early learn the simple rules of health  and good order by paying reasonable attention to those so-called minor  details, which pertain to the well-being of the person, and which must  be faithfully observed in order to avoid failure and win success.    A person, young or old, in or out of business, may keep a  memorandum-book in his pocket, in which he notes every particular  relative to appointments, addresses, and petty cash matters. An  accurate account of personal expenses should be kept, which should be  balanced each week. By this means each individual will be more careful  and economical in his expenditures, and generally live within his  income. He must be reasonable in spending, or his memorandum or  record-book, if it be honestly kept, will stand to his discredit.    A well-kept memorandum-book is often very useful, as it is very  convenient, and sometimes serves to settle a troublesome query,  arising in other minds, by which the possessor is absolved from the  prejudice of doubt. Young people who expect to labor with their  hands for what they have of this world's goods, or rise by their own  efforts, should by all means acquire habits of economy, learn to save,  form correct habits, and no time will be required overcoming these. So  surely as they do this, so surely will they be in a situation to ask  no special favors. Every man wants to learn to look out for himself  and rely upon himself. Every man needs to feel that he is the peer  of every other man, and he cannot do it if he is penniless. Money  is power, and those who have it exert a wider influence than the  destitute. Hence it should be the ambition of all young men to acquire  it, as well as to store their minds with useful knowledge.      GETTING A SITUATION.    In seeking a situation, it is always best to appear in person if  practicable. A business man who requires the services of a salesman or  clerk, a bookkeeper, stenographer, or some one to remain in his employ  a considerable time, usually prefers to see an applicant and have a  few words with him about the work that is to be done.    If an application has to be made by letter, it should be done in the  handwriting of the applicant. It may be brief, and should include  references.    It is best for a young man to learn a trade. In this country  the trades offer more stable means of subsistence than do other  departments of active life. His knowledge of a trade will form no  bar to any effort he may afterward make to rise to a higher or more  congenial calling.    When a position has been obtained by an applicant, he should at once  proceed to render himself indispensable to his employer by following  up the details of his work in a conscientious and agreeable manner.  Thus he will gain confidence and grow in favor with men who are quick  to recognize merit, and who respond to that which contributes to the  success of a meritorious man.    [Illustration]    There is always room in every business for an honest, hard-worker. It  will not do to presume otherwise; nor should one sit down to grumble  or concoct mischief. The most perilous hour of one's life is when he  is tempted to despond. He who loses, his courage loses all. There are  men in the world who would rather work than be idle at the same price.  Imitate them. Success is not far off. An honorable and happy life is  before you. Lay hold of it.             *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: DETECTING COUNTERFEIT MONEY.]    DETECTING COUNTERFEIT MONEY      The desire to accumulate property is one of the noblest that nature  has implanted in man, and it is through the successful results of  this desire, we are enabled to point with unerring certainty to  the disembarking line, which so surely characterizes the advanced  educated, refined and civilized man from that of the wild savage,  whose highest desire is to slay and rob his fellow men, and proudly  exhibit their scalps, or the plunder he has acquired, as evidence of  his cunning or courage.    It is through this inborn desire to accumulate that man is willing to  labor, toil, suffer, and forego present gratifications for the hope  of future greater satisfactions; that has resulted in the building and  equiping the mighty ships of commerce, whose white, spreading canvas  dots every sea where commerce may be known, or where the interests of  God's creatures may best be served. It is through this desire, coupled  with unremitting toil, that we owe everything of permanent enjoyment,  of enlightenment and of prosperity. The millions of dollars of"]]]
