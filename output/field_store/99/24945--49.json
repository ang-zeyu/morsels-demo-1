But the best example of this practice is  afforded by the rites of Dionysus, to which I will devote a few lines.  Dionysus, like other Sun or Nature deities, was born of a Virgin (Semele  or Demeter) untainted by any earthly husband; and born on the 25th.  December. He was nurtured in a Cave, and even at that early age was  identified with the Ram or Lamb, into whose form he was for the time  being changed. At times also he was worshiped in the form of a Bull.  (2) He travelled far and wide; and brought the great gift of wine to  mankind. (3) He was called Liberator, and Saviour. His grave \"was shown  at Delphi in the inmost shrine of the temple of Apollo. Secret offerings  were brought thither, while the women who were celebrating the feast  woke up the new-born god.... Festivals of this kind in celebration of  the extinction and resurrection of the deity were held (by women and  girls only) amid the mountains at night, every third year, about the  time of the shortest day. The rites, intended to express the excess of  grief and joy at the death and reappearance of the god, were wild even  to savagery, and the women who performed them were hence known by  the expressive names of Bacchae, Maenads, and Thyiades. They wandered  through woods and mountains, their flying locks crowned with ivy or  snakes, brandishing wands and torches, to the hollow sounds of the drum,  or the shrill notes of the flute, with wild dances and insane cries and  jubilation.\"     (1) See Frazer's Golden Bough, Part IV, p. 229.     (2) The Golden Bough, Part II, Book II, p. 164.     (3) \"I am the TRUE Vine,\" says the Jesus of the fourth gospel,  perhaps with an implicit and hostile reference to the cult of  Dionysus--in which Robertson suggests (Christianity and Mythology, p.  357) there was a ritual miracle of turning water into wine.      Oxen, goats, even fawns and roes from the forest were killed, torn to  pieces, and eaten raw. This in imitation of the treatment of Dionysus by  the Titans, (1)--who it was supposed had torn the god in pieces when a  child.     (1) See art. Dionysus. Dictionary of Classical Antiquities,  Nettleship and Sandys 3rd edn., London, 1898).      Dupuis, one of the earliest writers (at the beginning of last century)  on this subject, says, describing the mystic rites of Dionysus (1):  \"The sacred doors of the Temple in which the initiation took place were  opened only once a year, and no stranger might ever enter. Night lent to  these august mysteries a veil which was forbidden to be drawn aside--for  whoever it might be. (2) It was the sole occasion for the representation  of the passion of Bacchus (Dionysus) dead, descended into hell, and  rearisen--in imitation of the representation of the sufferings of Osiris  which, according to Herodotus, were commemorated at Sais in Egypt. It  was in that place that the partition took place of the body of the god,  (3) which was then eaten--the ceremony, in fact, of which our Eucharist  is only a reflection; whereas in the mysteries of Bacchus actual raw  flesh was distributed, which each of those present had to consume in  commemoration of the death of Bacchus dismembered by the Titans, and  whose passion, in Chios and Tenedos, was renewed each year by the  sacrifice of a man who represented the god. (4) Possibly it is this last  fact which made people believe that the Christians (whose hoc est corpus  meum and sharing of an Eucharistic meal were no more than a shadow of a  more ancient rite) did really sacrifice a child and devour its limbs.\"     (1) See Charles F. Dupuis, \"Traite des Mysteres,\" ch. i.     (2) Pausan, Corinth, ch. 37.     (3) Clem, Prot. Eur. Bacch.     (4) See Porphyry, De Abstinentia, lii, Section 56.      That Eucharistic rites were very very ancient is plain from the  Totem-sacraments of savages; and to this subject we shall now turn.          IV. TOTEM-SACRAMENTS AND EUCHARISTS    Much has been written on the origin of the Totem-system--the system,  that is, of naming a tribe or a portion of a tribe (say a CLAN)  after some ANIMAL--or sometimes--also after some plant or tree or  Nature-element, like fire or rain or thunder; but at best the subject is  a difficult one for us moderns to understand. A careful study has been  made of it by Salamon Reinach in his Cultes, Mythes et Religions, (1)  where he formulates his conclusions in twelve statements or definitions;  but even so--though his suggestions are helpful--he throws very little  light on the real origin of the system. (2)     (1) See English translation of certain chapters (published by  David Nutt in 1912) entitled Cults, Myths and Religions, pp. 1-25. The  French original is in three large volumes.     (2) The same may be said of the formulated statement of the  subject in Morris Jastrow's Handbooks of the History of Religion, vol.  iv.    There are three main difficulties. The first is to understand why  primitive Man should name his Tribe after an animal or object of nature  at all; the second, to understand on what principle he selected the  particular name (a lion, a crocodile, a lady bird, a certain tree); the  third, why he should make of the said totem a divinity, and pay honor  and worship to it. It may be worth while to pause for a moment over  these.    (1) The fact that the Tribe was one of the early things for which Man  found it necessary to have a name is interesting, because it shows  how early the solidarity and psychological actuality of the tribe  was recognized; and as to the selection of a name from some animal or  concrete object of Nature, that was inevitable, for the simple reason  that there was nothing else for the savage to choose from. Plainly to  call his tribe \"The Wayfarers\" or \"The Pioneers\" or the \"Pacifists\" or  the \"Invincibles,\" or by any of the thousand and one names which modern  associations adopt, would have been impossible, since such abstract  terms had little or no existence in his mind. And again to name it after  an animal was the most obvious thing to do, simply because the animals  were by far the most important features or accompaniments of his own  life. As I am dealing in this book largely with certain psychological  conditions of human evolution, it has to be pointed out that to  primitive man the animal was the nearest and most closely related of all  objects. Being of the same order of consciousness as himself, the animal  appealed to him very closely as his mate and equal. He made with regard  to it little or no distinction from himself. We see this very clearly in  the case of children, who of course represent the savage mind, and who  regard animals simply as their mates and equals, and come quickly into  rapport with them, not differentiating themselves from them.    (2) As to the particular animal or other object selected in order to  give a name to the Tribe, this would no doubt be largely accidental. Any  unusual incident might superstitiously precipitate a name. We can hardly  imagine the Tribe scratching its congregated head in the deliberate  effort to think out a suitable emblem for itself. That is not the way in  which nicknames are invented in a school or anywhere else to-day. At the  same time the heraldic appeal of a certain object of nature, animate or  inanimate, would be deeply and widely felt. The strength of the lion,  the fleetness of the deer, the food-value of a bear, the flight of a  bird, the awful jaws of a crocodile, might easily mesmerize a whole  tribe. Reinach points out, with great justice, that many tribes placed  themselves under the protection of animals which were supposed (rightly  or wrongly) to act as guides and augurs, foretelling the future.  \"Diodorus,\" he says, \"distinctly states that the hawk, in Egypt, was  venerated because it foretold the future.\" (Birds generally act as   and Samoa the kangaroo, the crow and the owl premonish their fellow  clansmen of events to come. At one time the Samoan warriors went so far  as to rear owls for their prophetic qualities in war. (The jackal,  or 'pathfinder'--whose tracks sometimes lead to the remains of a  food-animal slain by a lion, and many birds and insects, have a value of  this kind.) \"The use of animal totems for purposes of augury is, in all  likelihood, of great antiquity. Men must soon have realized that the  senses of animals were acuter than their own; nor is it surprising that  they should have expected their totems--that is to say, their natural  allies--to forewarn them both of unsuspected dangers and of those  provisions of nature, WELLS especially, which animals seem to scent  by instinct.\" (1) And again, beyond all this, I have little doubt that  there are subconscious affinities which unite certain tribes to certain  animals or plants, affinities whose origin we cannot now trace, though  they are very real--the same affinities that we recognize as existing  between individual PERSONS and certain objects of nature. W. H.  Hudson--himself in many respects having this deep and primitive relation  to nature--speaks in a very interesting and autobiographical volume (2)  of the extraordinary fascination exercised upon him as a boy, not  only by a snake, but by certain trees, and especially by a particular  flowering-plant \"not more than a foot in height, with downy soft  pale green leaves, and clusters of reddish blossoms, something like  valerian.\" ... \"One of my sacred flowers,\" he calls it, and insists on  the \"inexplicable attraction\" which it had for him. In various ways of  this kind one can perceive how particular totems came to be selected by  particular peoples.       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#9)"],[1,"et, and we can detect no movement  of the colors. The dark lines of the spectrum are the cutting out of  rays of definite wave-lengths. If the color spectrum moves away,  they move with it, and away from their proper place in the ordinary  spectrum. If, then, we find them toward the red end, the star is  receding; if toward the violet end, it is approaching. Turn the  instrument on the centre of the sun. The dark lines take their  appropriate place, and are recognized on the ruled scale. Turn it on  one edge, that is approaching us one and a quarter miles a second by  the revolution of the sun on its axis, the spectral lines move  toward the violet end; turn the spectroscope toward the other edge  of the sun, it is receding from us one and a quarter miles a second  by reason of the axial revolution, and the spectral lines move  toward the red end. Turn it near the spots, and it reveals the  mighty up-rush in one place and the down-rush in another of one  hundred miles a second. We speak of it as an easy matter, but it is  a problem of the greatest delicacy, almost defying the mind of man  to read the movements of matter.    It should be recognized that Professor Young, of [Page 54]  Princeton, is the most successful operator in this recent realm of  science. He already proposes to correct the former estimate of the  sun's axial revolutions, derived from observing its spots, by the  surer process of observing accelerated and retarded light.    Within a very few years this wonderful instrument, the spectroscope,  has made amazing discoveries. In chemistry it reveals substances  never known before; in analysis it is delicate to the detection of  the millionth of a grain. It is the most deft handmaid of chemistry,  the arts, of medical science, and astronomy. It tells the chemical  constitution of the sun, the movements taking place, the nature of  comets, and nebulae. By the spectroscope we know that the atmospheres  of Venus and Mars are like our own; that those of Jupiter and Saturn  are very unlike; it tells us which stars approach and which recede,  and just how one star differeth from another in glory and substance.    In the near future we shall have the brilliant and diversely colored  flowers of the sky as well classified into orders and species as  are the flowers of the earth.          [Page 55]  IV.    CELESTIAL MEASUREMENTS.    \"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted  out heaven with the span? Mine hand also hath laid the foundation  of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens.\"--_Isa._  xl. 12; xlviii. 13.    [Page 56]   \"Go to yon tower, where busy science plies    Her vast antennae, feeling thro' the skies;    That little vernier, on whose slender lines    The midnight taper trembles as it shines,    A silent index, tracks the planets' march    In all their wanderings thro' the ethereal arch,    Tells through the mist where dazzled Mercury burns,    And marks the spot where Uranus returns.     \"So, till by wrong or negligence effaced,    The living index which thy Maker traced    Repeats the line each starry virtue draws    Through the wide circuit of creation's laws;    Still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray    Where the dark shadows of temptation stray;    But, once defaced, forgets the orbs of light,    And leaves thee wandering o'er the expanse of night.\"        OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.          [Page 57]  IV.    _CELESTIAL MEASUREMENTS._    We know that astronomy has what are called practical uses. If a  ship had been driven by Euroclydon ten times fourteen days and  nights without sun or star appearing, a moment's glance into the  heavens from the heaving deck, by a very slightly educated sailor,  would tell within one hundred yards where he was, and determine  the distance and way to the nearest port. We know that, in all  final and exact surveying, positions must be fixed by the stars.  Earth's landmarks are uncertain and easily removed; those which  we get from the heavens are stable and exact.    In 1878 the United States steam-ship _Enterprise_ was sent to survey  the Amazon. Every night a \"star party\" went ashore to fix the exact  latitude and longitude by observations of the stars. Our real landmarks  are not the pillars we rear, but the stars millions of miles away.  All our standards of time are taken from the stars; every railway  train runs by their time to avoid collision; by them all factories  start and stop. Indeed, we are ruled by the stars even more than  the old astrologers imagined.    Man's finest mechanism, highest thought, and broadest exercise  of the creative faculty have been inspired by astronomy. No other  instruments approximate in delicacy those which explore the heavens;  no other [Page 58] system of thought can draw such vast and certain  conclusions from its premises. \"Too low they build who build beneath  the stars;\" we should lay our foundations in the skies, and then  build upward.    We have been placed on the outside of this earth, instead of the  inside, in order that we may look abroad. We are carried about,  through unappreciable distance, at the inconceivable velocity of  one thousand miles a minute, to give us different points of vision.  The earth, on its softly-spinning axle, never jars enough to unnest  a bird or wake a child; hence the foundations of our observatories  are firm, and our measurements exact. Whoever studies astronomy,  under proper guidance and in the right spirit, grows in thought  and feeling, and becomes more appreciative of the Creator.    _Celestial Movements._    Let it not be supposed that a mastery of mathematics and a finished  education are necessary to understand the results of astronomical  research. It took at first the highest power of mind to make the  discoveries that are now laid at the feet of the lowliest. It took  sublime faith, courage, and the results of ages of experience in  navigation, to enable Columbus to discover that path to the New  World which now any little boat can follow. Ages of experience  and genius are stored up in a locomotive, but quite an unlettered  man can drive it. It is the work of genius to render difficult  matters plain, abstruse thoughts clear.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    A brief explanation of a few terms will make the principles of  world inspection easily understood. Imagine a perfect circle thirty  feet in diameter--that is, create [Page 59] one (Fig. 19). Draw  through it a diameter horizontally, another perpendicularly. The  angles made by the intersecting lines are each said to be ninety  degrees, marked thus  deg.. The arc of a circle included between any two  of the lines is also 90 deg.. Every circle, great or small, is divided  into these 360 deg.. If the sun rose in the east and came to the zenith  at noon, it would have passed 90 deg.. When it set in the west it would  have traversed half the circle, or 180 deg.. In Fig. 20 the angle of the  lines measured on the graduated arc is 10 deg.. The mountain is 10 deg.  high, the world 10 deg. in diameter, the comet moves 10 deg. a day, the  stars are 10 deg. apart. The height of the mountain, the diameter of the  world, the velocity of the comet, and the distance between the  stars, depend on the distance of each from the point of sight. Every  degree is divided into 60 minutes (marked '), and every minute into  60 seconds (marked \").    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Illustration of Angles.]    Imagine yourself inside a perfect sphere one hundred feet in diameter,  with the interior surface above, around, and below studded with  fixed bright points like stars. The familiar constellations of  night might be blazoned there in due proportion.    If this star-sprent sphere were made to revolve once in twenty-four  hours, all the stars would successively [Page 60] pass in review.  How easily we could measure distances between stars, from a certain  fixed meridian, or the equator! How easily we could tell when any  particular star would culminate! It is as easy to take all these  measurements when our earthly observatory is steadily revolved  within the sphere of circumambient stars. Stars can be mapped as  readily as the streets of a great city. Looking down on it in the  night, one could trace the lines of lighted streets, and judge  something of its extent and regularity. But the few lamps of evening  would suggest little of the greatness of the public buildings, the  magnificent enterprise and commerce of its citizens, or the  intelligence of its scholars. Looking up to the lamps of the  celestial city, one can judge something of its extent and  regularity; but they suggest little of the magnificence of the many  mansions.    Stars are reckoned as so many degrees, minutes, and seconds from  each other, from the zenith, or from a given meridian, or from the  equator. Thus the stars called the Pointers, in the Great Bear,  are 5 deg. apart; the nearest one is 29 deg. from the Pole Star, which is  39 deg. 56' 29\" above the horizon at Philadelphia. In going to England  you creep up toward the north end of the earth, till the Pole Star  is 54 deg. high. It stays near its place among the stars continually,     \"Of whose true-fixed and resting quality    There is no fellow in the firmament.\"    _How to Measure._    Suppose a telescope, fixed to a mural circle, to revolve on an axis,  as in Fig. 21; point it horizontally at a star; [Page 61] turn it up  perpendicular to another star. Of course the two stars are 90 deg.  apart, and the graduated scale, which is attached to the outer edge  of the circle, shows a revolution of a quarter circle, or 90 deg., But a  perfect accuracy of measurement must be sought; for to mistake the  breadth of a hair, seen at the distance of one hundred and  twenty-five feet, would cause an error of 3,000,000 miles at the  distance of the sun, and immensely more at the distance of the  stars. The correction of an inaccuracy of no greater magnitude than  that has"]]]
