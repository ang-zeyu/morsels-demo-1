An ox which gores someone to death shall be stoned.    If one steals or slays another's ox, he must give two oxen for it.    The man who has land left to him by his kindred must not give it  away from his kindred, if there is a writing or witness that  such was forbidden by those men who at first acquired it, and by  those who gave it to him; and then let that be declared in the  presence of the king and of the bishop, before his kinsmen.                                 - Judicial Procedure -    Cases were held at monthly meetings of the hundred court. The king  or one of his reeves, conducted the trial by compurgation.    In compurgation, the one complaining, called the \"plaintiff\", and  the one defending, called the \"defendant\", each told their story  and put his hand on the Bible and swore \"By God this oath is clean  and true\". A slip or a stammer would mean he lost the case.  Otherwise, community members would stand up to swear on behalf of  the plaintiff or the defendant as to their reputation for  veracity. The value of a man's oath was commensurate with his  value or wergeld. A man's brothers were usually his compurgators.  If these \"compurgators\" were too few, usually twelve in number, or  recited poorly, their party lost. If this process was  inconclusive, the parties could bring witnesses to declare such  knowledge as they had as neighbors. These witnesses, male and  female, swore to particular points determined by the court.    If the witnesses failed, the defendant was told to go to church  and to take the sacrament only if he or she were innocent. If he  or she took the sacrament, he or she was tried by the process of  \"ordeal\", which was administered by the church. In the ordeal by  cold water, he was given a drink of holy water and then bound hand  and foot and thrown into water. If he floated, he was guilty. If  he sank, he was innocent. It was not necessary to drown to be  deemed innocent. In the ordeal by hot water, he had to pick up a  stone from inside a boiling cauldron. If his hand was healing in  three days, he was innocent. If it was festering, he was guilty. A  similar ordeal was that of hot iron, in which one had to carry in  his hands a hot iron for a certain distance. The results of the  ordeal were taken to indicate the will of God. Presumably a person  convicted of murder, i.e. killing by stealth, or robbery [taking  from a person's robe, that is, his person or breaking into his  home to steal] would be hung and his possessions confiscated. A  bishop's oath was incontrovertible. Accused archbishops and  bishops could clear themselves with an oath that they were  guiltless. Lesser ranks could clear themselves with the oaths of  three compurgators of their rank or, for more serious offenses,  undergo the ordeal of the consecrated morsel. For this, one would  swallow a morsel; if he choked on it, he was guilty.    Any inanimate or animate object or personal chattel which was  found by a court to be the immediate cause of death was forfeited  as \"deodand\", for instance, a tree from which a man fell to his  death, a beast which killed a man, a sword of a third party not  the slayer that was used to kill a man. The deodand was to go to  the dead man's kin so they could wreak their vengeance on it,  which in turn would cause the dead man to lie in peace.    This is a lawsuit regarding rights to feed pigs in a certain  woodland:    \"In the year 825 which had passed since the birth of Christ, and  in the course of the second Indiction, and during the reign of  Beornwulf, King of Mercia, a council meeting was held in the  famous place called Clofesho, and there the said King Beornwulf  and his bishops and his earls and all the councilors of this  nation were assembled. Then there was a very noteworthy suit about  wood pasture at Sinton, towards the west in Scirhylte. The reeves  in charge of the pigherds wished to extend the pasture farther,  and take in more of the wood than the ancient rights permitted.  Then the bishop and the advisors of the community said that they  would not admit liability for more than had been appointed in  AEthelbald's day, namely mast for 300 swine, and that the bishop  and the community should have two thirds of the wood and of the  mast. The Archbishop Wulfred and all the councilors determined  that the bishop and the community might declare on oath that it  was so appointed in AEthelbald's time and that they were not  trying to obtain more, and the bishop immediately gave security to  Earl Eadwulf to furnish the oath before all the councilors, and it  was produced in 30 days at the bishop's see at Worcester. At that  time Hama was the reeve in charge of the pigherds at Sinton, and  he rode until he reached Worcester, and watched and observed the  oath, as Earl Eadwulf bade him, but did not challenge it.  Here are the names and designations of those who were assembled at  the council meeting ...\"                                         - - - Chapter 3 - - -                                - The Times: 900-1066 -    There were many large landholders such as the King, earls, and  bishops. Earls were noblemen by birth, and often relatives of the  King. They were his army commanders and the highest civil  officials, each responsible for a shire. A breach of the public  peace of an earl would occasion a fine. Lower in social status  were freemen: sokemen, and then, in decreasing order, villani  [villeins], bordarii, and cottarii. The servi were the slaves.  Probably all who were not slaves were freemen.    Kings typically granted land in exchange for services of military  duties, maintaining fortresses, and repairing bridges. Less common  services required by landlords include equipping a guard ship and  guarding the coast, guarding the lord, military watch, maintaining  the deer fence at the King's residence, alms giving, and church  dues. Since this land was granted in return for service, there  were limitations on its heritability and often an heir had to pay  a heriot to the landlord to obtain the land. A heriot was  originally the armor of a man killed, which went to the King. The  heriot of a thegn who had soken came to be about 80s.; of a kings'  thegn about four lances, two coats of mail, two swords, and 125s.;  of an earl about eight horses, four saddled and four unsaddled,  eight lances, four coats of mail, four swords, and 500s.    There were several thousand thegns, rich and poor, who held land  directly of the King. Some thegns had soken or jurisdiction over  their own lands and others did not. Free farmers who had sought  protection from thegns in time of war now took them as their  lords. A freeman could chose his lord, following him in war and  working his land in peace. All able-bodied freemen were liable to  military service in the fyrd [national militia], but not in a  lord's private wars. In return, the lord would protect him against  encroaching neighbors, back him in the courts of law, and feed him  in times of famine. But often, lords raided each other's farmers,  who fled into the hills or woods for safety. Often a lord's  fighting men stayed with him at his large house, but later were  given land with inhabitants on it, who became his tenants. The  lords were the ruling class and the greatest of them sat in the  King's council along with bishops, abbots, and officers of the  King's household. The lesser lords were local magnates, who  officiated at the shire and hundred courts.    Staghunting, foxhunting, and hawking were reserved for lords who  did not work with their hands. Every free born person had the  right to hunt other game.    There was a great expansion of arable land. Some land had been  specifically allocated to certain individuals. Some was common  land, held by communities. If a family came to pay the dues and  fines on certain common land, it could become personal to that  family and was then known as heirland. Most land came to be  privately held from community-witnessed allotments or inheritance.  Bookland was those holdings written down in books. This land was  usually land that had been given to the church or monasteries  because church clerics could write. So many thegns gave land to  the church, usually a hide, that the church held 1/3 of the land  of the realm. Folkland was that land that was left over after  allotments had been made to the freemen and which was not common  land. It was public land and a national asset and could be  converted to heirland or bookland only by action of the king and  witan. It could also be rented by services to the state via  charter. A holder of folkland might express a wish, e.g. by  testamentary action, for a certain disposition of it, such as an  estate for life or lives for a certain individual. But a distinct  act by the king and witan was necessary for this wish to take  effect. Small private transactions of land could be done by  \"livery of seisin\" in the presence of neighbors. All estates in  land could be let, lent, or leased by its holders, and was then  known as \"loenland\".    Ploughs and wagons could be drawn by four or more oxen or horses in sets  of two behind each other. Oxenshoes and horseshoes prevented lameness  due to cracked hooves. Horse collars especially fitted for horses,  replaced oxen yoke that had been used on horses. The horse collar did  not restrict breathing and enabled horses to use the same strength of  oxen. Also, horses had better endurance and faster speed.    A free holder's house was wood, perhaps with a stone foundation,  and roofed with thatch or tiles. There was a main room or hall,  with bed chambers around it. Beyond was the kitchen, perhaps  outside under a lean-to. These buildings were surrounded by a bank  or stiff hedge.    Simple people lived in huts made from wood and mud, with one door  and no windows. They slept around a wood-burning fire in the  middle of the earthen floor. They wore shapeless clothes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#9)"],[1," Complete Breath, counting (mentally) 1, 2, 3,       4, 5, 6, 7, 8, one count to each step, making the inhalation       extend over the eight counts.         (3) Exhale slowly through the nostrils, counting as       before--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--one count to a step.         (4) Rest between breaths, continuing walking and counting,       I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 8, one count to a step.         (5) Repeat until you begin to feel tired. Then rest for a       while, and resume at pleasure. Repeat several times a day.    Some Yogis vary this exercise by retaining the breath during a 1, 2,  3, 4, count, and then exhale in an eight-step count. Practice  whichever plan seems most agreeable to you.    (6) MORNING EXERCISE.         (1) Stand erect in a military attitude, head up, eyes front,       shoulders back, knees stiff, hands at sides.         (2) Raise body slowly on toes, inhaling a Complete Breath,       steadily and slowly.         (3) Retain the breath for a few seconds, maintaining the       same position.         (4) Slowly sink to first position, at the same time slowly       exhaling the air through the nostrils.         (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.         (6) Repeat several times, varying by using right leg alone,       then left leg alone.    (7) STIMULATING CIRCULATION.         (1) Stand erect.         (2) Inhale a Complete Breath and retain.         (3) Bend forward slightly and grasp a stick or cane steadily       and firmly, and gradually exerting your entire strength upon       the grasp.         (4) Relax the grasp, return to first position, and slowly       exhale.         (5) Repeat several times.         (6) Finish with the Cleansing Breath.    This exercise may be performed without the use of a stick or cane, by  grasping an imaginary cane, using the will to exert the pressure. The  exercise is a favorite Yogi plan of stimulating the circulation by  driving the arterial blood to the extremities, and drawing back the  venous blood to the heart and lungs that it may take up the oxygen  which has been inhaled with the air. In cases of poor circulation  there is not enough blood in the lungs to absorb the increased amount  of oxygen inhaled, and the system does not get the full benefit of the  improved breathing.    In such cases, particularly, It Is well to practice this exercise,  occasionally with the regular Complete Breathing exercise.          CHAPTER XII.      SEVEN MINOR YOGI EXERCISES.    This chapter is composed of seven minor Yogi Breathing Exercises,  bearing no special names, but each distinct and separate from the  others and having a different purpose in view. Each student will find  several of these exercises best adapted to the special requirements of  his particular case. Although we have styled these exercises \"minor  exercises,\" they are quite valuable and useful, or they would not  appear in this book. They give one a condensed course in \"Physical  Culture\" and \"Lung Development,\" and might readily be \"padded out\" and  elaborated into a small book on these subjects. They have, of course,  an additional value, as Yogi Breathing forms a part of each exercise.  Do not pass them by because they are marked \"minor.\" Some one or more  of these exercises may be just what you need. Try them and decide for  yourself.    EXERCISE I.         (1) Stand erect with hands at sides.         (2) Inhale Complete Breath.         (3) Raise the arms slowly, keeping them rigid until the       hands touch over head.         (4) Retain the breath a few minutes with hands over head.         (5) Lower hands slowly to sides, exhaling slowly at same time.         (6) Practice Cleansing Breath.    EXERCISE II.         (1) Stand erect, with arms straight In front of you.         (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.         (3) Swing arms back as far as they will go; then back to       first position; then repeat several times, returning the       breath all the while.         (4) Exhale vigorously through mouth.         (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.    EXERCISE III.         (1) Stand erect with arms straight In front of you,         (2) Inhale Complete Breath.         (3) Swing arms around in a circle, backward, a few times.       Then reverse a few times, retaining the breath all the       while. You may vary this by rotating them alternately like       the sails of a windmill.         (4) Exhale the breath vigorously through the mouth.         (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.    EXERCISE IV.         (1) Lie on the floor with your face downward and palms of       hands flat upon the floor by your sides.         (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.         (3) Stiffen the body and raise yourself up by the strength       of your arms until you rest on your hands and toes         (4) Then lower yourself to original position. Repeat several       times.         (5) Exhale vigorously through your mouth.         (6) Practice Cleansing Breath.    EXERCISE V.         (1) Stand erect with your palms against the wall.         (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.         (3) Lower the chest to the wall, resting your weight on your       hands.         (4) Then raise yourself back with the arm muscles alone,       keeping the body stiff.         (5) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.         (6) Practice Cleansing Breath.    EXERCISE VI.         (1) Stand erect with arms \"akimbo,\" that is, with hands       resting around the waist and elbows standing out.         (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.         (3) Keep legs and hips stiff and bend well forward, as If       bowing, at the same time exhaling slowly.         (4) Return to first position and take another Complete Breath.         (5) Then bend backward, exhaling slowly.         (6) Return to first position and take a Complete Breath.         (7) Then bend sideways, exhaling slowly. (Vary by bending to       right and then to left.)         (8) Practice Cleansing Breath.    EXERCISE VII.         (1) Stand erect, or sit erect, with straight spinal column.         (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, but instead of inhaling in a       continuous steady stream, take a series of short, quick       \"sniffs,\" as if you were smelling aromatic salts or ammonia       and did not wish to get too strong a \"whiff.\" Do not exhale       any of these little breaths, but add one to the other until       the entire lung space Is filled.         (3) Retain for a few seconds.         (4) Exhale through the nostrils in a long, restful, sighing       breath.         (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.          CHAPTER XIII.      VIBRATION AND YOGI RHYTHMIC BREATHING    All is in vibration. From the tiniest atom to the greatest sun,  everything is in a state of vibration. There is nothing in absolute  rest in nature. A single atom deprived of vibration would wreck the  universe. In incessant vibration the universal work is performed.  Matter is being constantly played upon by energy and countless forms  and numberless varieties result, and yet even the forms and varieties  are not permanent. They begin to change the moment they are created,  and from them are born innumerable forms, which in turn change and  give rise to newer forms, and so on and on, in infinite succession.  Nothing is permanent in the world of forms, and yet the great Reality  is unchangeable. Forms are but appearances--they come, they go, but  the Reality is eternal and unchangeable.    The atoms of the human body are in constant vibration. Unceasing  changes are occurring. In a few months there is almost a complete  change in the matter composing the body, and scarcely a single atom  now composing your body will be found in It a few months hence.  Vibration, constant vibration. Change, constant change.    In all vibration is to be found a certain rhythm. Rhythm pervades the  universe. The swing of the planets around the sun; the rise and fall  of the sea; the beating of the heart; the ebb and flow of the tide;  all follow rhythmics laws. The rays of the sun reach us; the rain  descends upon us, in obedience to the same law. All growth is but an  exhibition of this law. All motion is a manifestation of the law of  rhythm.    Our bodies are as much subject to rhythmic laws as is the planet in  its revolution around the sun. Much of the esoteric side of the Yogi  Science of Breath is based upon this known principle of nature. By  falling in with the rhythm of the body, the Yogi manages to absorb a  great amount of Prana, which he disposes of to bring about results  desired by him. We will speak of this at greater length later on.    The body which you occupy is like a small inlet running in to the land  from the sea. Although apparently subject only to its own laws, it is  really subject to the ebb and flow of the tides of the ocean. The  great sea of life is swelling and receding, rising and falling, and we  are responding to its vibrations and rhythm. In a normal condition we  receive the vibration and rhythm of the great ocean of life, and  respond to it, but at times the mouth of the inlet seems choked up  with debris, and we fail to receive the impulse from Mother Ocean, and  inharmony manifests within us.    You have heard how a note on a violin, if sounded repeatedly and in  rhythm, will start into motion vibrations which will in time destroy a  bridge. The same result is true when a regiment of soldiers crosses a  bridge, the order being always given to \"break step\" on such an  occasion, lest the vibration bring down both bridge and regiment.  These manifestations of the effect of rhythmic motion will give you an  idea of the effect on the body of rhythmic breathing. The whole system  catches the vibration and becomes in harmony with the will, which  causes the rhythmic motion of the lungs, and while in such complete  harmony will respond readily to orders from the will. With the body  thus attuned, the Yogi finds no difficulty in increasing the  circulation in any part of the body by an order from the"]]]
