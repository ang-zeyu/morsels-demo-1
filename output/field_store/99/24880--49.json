I will tell you, my friends,\"  said Bonaparte condescendingly. \"The imagination unaided cannot conceive  it: but by the help of the Lord I will put it before your mind's eye.    \"I was travelling in Italy once on a time; I came to a city called Rome,  a vast city, and near it is a mountain which spits forth fire. Its name  is Etna. Now, there was a man in that city of Rome who had not the fear  of God before his eyes, and he loved a woman. The woman died, and he  walked up that mountain spitting fire, and when he got to the top he  threw himself in at the hole that is there. The next day I went up.  I was not afraid; the Lord preserves His servants. And in their hands  shall they bear thee up, lest at any time thou fall into a volcano. It  was dark night when I got there, but in the fear of the Lord I walked to  the edge of the yawning abyss, and looked in. That sight--that sight, my  friends, is impressed upon my most indelible memory. I looked down into  the lurid depths upon an incandescent lake, a melted fire, a seething  sea; the billows rolled from side to side, and on their fiery crests  tossed the white skeleton of the suicide. The heat had burnt the flesh  from off the bones; they lay as a light cork upon the melted, fiery  waves. One skeleton hand was raised upward, the finger pointing to  heaven; the other, with outstretched finger, pointing downward, as  though it would say, 'I go below, but you, Bonaparte, may soar above.' I  gazed; I stood entranced. At that instant there was a crack in the lurid  lake; it swelled, expanded, and the skeleton of the suicide disappeared,  to be seen no more by mortal eye.\"    Here again Bonaparte rested, and then continued:    \"The lake of melted stone rose in the crater, it swelled higher and  higher at the side, it streamed forth at the top. I had presence of  mind; near me was a rock; I stood upon it. The fiery torrent was  vomited out and streamed on either side of me. And through that long and  terrible night I stood there alone upon that rock, the glowing,  fiery lava on every hand--a monument of the long-suffering and tender  providence of the Lord, who spared me that I might this day testify in  your ears of Him.    \"Now, my dear friends, let us deduce the lessons that are to be learnt  from this narrative.    \"Firstly: let us never commit suicide. The man is a fool, my friends,  that man is insane, my friends, who would leave this earth, my friends.  Here are joys innumerable, such as it hath not entered into the heart  of man to understand, my friends. Here are clothes, my friends; here  are beds, my friends; here is delicious food, my friends. Our precious  bodies were given us to love, to cherish. Oh, let us do so! Oh, let us  never hurt them; but care for and love them, my friends!\"    Every one was impressed, and Bonaparte proceeded:    \"Thirdly; let us not love too much. If that young man had not loved that  young woman, he would not have jumped into Mount Etna. The good men of  old never did so. Was Jeremiah ever in love, or Ezekiel, or Hosea, or  even any of the minor prophets? No. Then why should we be? Thousands  are rolling in that lake at this moment who would say, 'It was love that  brought us here.' Oh, let us think always of our own souls first.         \"'A charge to keep I have,           A God to glorify;         A never-dying soul to save,           And fit it for the sky.'    \"Oh, beloved friends, remember the little boy and the meiboss; remember  the young girl and the young man; remember the lake, the fire, and the  brimstone; remember the suicide's skeleton on the pitchy billows of  Mount Etna; remember the voice of warning that has this day sounded in  your ears; and what I say to you I say to all--watch! May the Lord add  his blessings!\"    Here the Bible closed with a tremendous thud. Tant Sannie loosened the  white handkerchief about her neck and wiped her eyes, and the coloured  girl, seeing her do so, sniffled. The did not understand the discourse,  which made it the more affecting.    There hung over it that inscrutable charm which hovers forever for the  human intellect over the incomprehensible and shadowy. When the last  hymn was sung the German conducted the officiator to Tant Sannie, who  graciously extended her hand, and offered coffee and a seat on the  sofa. Leaving him there, the German hurried away to see how the little  plum-pudding he had left at home was advancing; and Tant Sannie remarked  that it was a hot day. Bonaparte gathered her meaning as she fanned  herself with the end of her apron. He bowed low in acquiescence. A long  silence followed. Tant Sannie spoke again. Bonaparte gave her no ear;  his eye was fixed on a small miniature on the opposite wall, which  represented Tant Sannie as she had appeared on the day before her  confirmation, fifteen years before, attired in green muslin. Suddenly he  started to his feet, walked up to the picture, and took his stand before  it. Long and wistfully he gazed into its features; it was easy to see  that he was deeply moved. With a sudden movement, as though no longer  able to restrain himself, he seized the picture, loosened it from  its nail, and held it close to his eyes. At length, turning to the  Boer-woman, he said, in a voice of deep emotion:    \"You will, I trust, dear madam, excuse this exhibition of my feelings;  but this--this little picture recalls to me my first and best beloved,  my dear departed wife, who is now a saint in heaven.\"    Tant Sannie could not understand; but the Hottentot maid, who had taken  her seat on the floor beside her mistress, translated the English into  Dutch as far as she was able.    \"Ah, my first, my beloved!\" he added, looking tenderly down at the  picture. \"Oh, the beloved, the beautiful lineaments! My angel wife! This  is surely a sister of yours, madame?\" he added, fixing his eyes on Tant  Sannie.    The Dutchwoman blushed, shook her head, and pointed to herself.    Carefully, intently, Bonaparte looked from the picture in his hand to  Tant Sannie's features, and from the features back to the picture. Then  slowly a light broke over his countenance, he looked up, it became  a smile; he looked back at the miniature, his whole countenance was  effulgent.    \"Ah, yes; I see it now,\" he cried, turning his delighted gaze on the  Boer-woman; \"eyes, mouth, nose, chin, the very expression!\" he cried.  \"How is it possible I did not notice it before?\"    \"Take another cup of coffee,\" said Tant Sannie. \"Put some sugar in.\"    Bonaparte hung the picture tenderly up, and was turning to take the cup  from her hand, when the German appeared, to say that the pudding was  ready and the meat on the table.    \"He's a God-fearing man, and one who knows how to behave himself,\" said  the Boer-woman as he went out at the door. \"If he's ugly, did not the  Lord make him? And are we to laugh at the Lord's handiwork? It is better  to be ugly and good than pretty and bad; though of course it's nice when  one is both,\" said Tant Sannie, looking complacently at the picture on  the wall.    In the afternoon the German and Bonaparte sat before the door of the  cabin. Both smoked in complete silence--Bonaparte with a book in his  hands and his eyes half closed; the German puffing vigorously, and  glancing up now and again at the serene blue sky overhead.    \"Supposing--you--you, in fact, made the remark to me,\" burst forth the  German suddenly, \"that you were looking for a situation.\"    Bonaparte opened his mouth wide, and sent a stream of smoke through his  lips.    \"Now supposing,\" said the German--\"merely supposing, of course--that  some one, some one, in fact, should make an offer to you, say, to become  schoolmaster on their farm and teach two children, two little girls,  perhaps, and would give you forty pounds a year, would you accept it?  Just supposing, of course.\"    \"Well, my dear friend,\" said Bonaparte, \"that would depend on  circumstances. Money is no consideration with me. For my wife I have  made provision for the next year. My health is broken. Could I meet a  place where a gentleman would be treated as a gentleman I would accept  it, however small the remuneration. With me,\" said Bonaparte, \"money is  no consideration.\"    \"Well,\" said the German, when he had taken a whiff or two more from his  pipe, \"I think I shall go up and see Tant Sannie a little. I go up often  on Sunday afternoon to have a general conversation, to see her, you  know. Nothing--nothing particular, you know.\"    The old man put his book into his pocket, and walked up to the farmhouse  with a peculiarly knowing and delighted expression of countenance.    \"He doesn't suspect what I'm going to do,\" soliloquized the German;  \"hasn't the least idea. A nice surprise for him.\"    The man whom he had left at his doorway winked at the retreating figure  with a wink that was not to be described.        Chapter 1.VI. Bonaparte Blenkins Makes His Nest.    \"Ah, what is the matter?\" asked Waldo, stopping at the foot of the  ladder with a load of skins on his back that he was carrying up to the  loft. Through the open door in the gable little Em was visible, her  feet dangling from the high bench on which she sat. The room, once a  storeroom, had been divided by a row of mealie bags into two parts--the  back being Bonaparte's bedroom, the front his schoolroom.    \"Lyndall made him angry,\" said the girl tearfully; \"and he has given  me the fourteenth of John to learn. He says he will teach me to behave  myself when Lyndall troubles him.\"    \"What did she do?\" asked the boy.    \"You see,\" said Em, hopelessly turning the leaves, \"whenever he talks  she looks out at the door, as though she did not hear him. Today  she asked him what the signs of the Zodiac were, and he said he was  surprised that she should ask him; it was not a fit and proper thing for  little girls to talk about. Then she asked him who Copernicus was; and  he said he was one of"]]]
