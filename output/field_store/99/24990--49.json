[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#9)"],[1," the commands of an oracle, and who recognized a Divine plan  in man and nature. (Xen. Mem.) And the language of the Apology and of  the Crito confirms this view.    The Phaedo is not one of the Socratic Dialogues of Plato; nor, on the  other hand, can it be assigned to that later stage of the Platonic  writings at which the doctrine of ideas appears to be forgotten. It  belongs rather to the intermediate period of the Platonic philosophy,  which roughly corresponds to the Phaedrus, Gorgias, Republic,  Theaetetus. Without pretending to determine the real time of their  composition, the Symposium, Meno, Euthyphro, Apology, Phaedo may be  conveniently read by us in this order as illustrative of the life of  Socrates. Another chain may be formed of the Meno, Phaedrus, Phaedo,  in which the immortality of the soul is connected with the doctrine of  ideas. In the Meno the theory of ideas is based on the ancient belief in  transmigration, which reappears again in the Phaedrus as well as in the  Republic and Timaeus, and in all of them is connected with a doctrine of  retribution. In the Phaedrus the immortality of the soul is supposed to  rest on the conception of the soul as a principle of motion, whereas in  the Republic the argument turns on the natural continuance of the soul,  which, if not destroyed by her own proper evil, can hardly be destroyed  by any other. The soul of man in the Timaeus is derived from the Supreme  Creator, and either returns after death to her kindred star, or descends  into the lower life of an animal. The Apology expresses the same view  as the Phaedo, but with less confidence; there the probability of death  being a long sleep is not excluded. The Theaetetus also describes, in a  digression, the desire of the soul to fly away and be with God--'and to  fly to him is to be like him.' The Symposium may be observed to  resemble as well as to differ from the Phaedo. While the first notion of  immortality is only in the way of natural procreation or of posthumous  fame and glory, the higher revelation of beauty, like the good in the  Republic, is the vision of the eternal idea. So deeply rooted in  Plato's mind is the belief in immortality; so various are the forms of  expression which he employs.    As in several other Dialogues, there is more of system in the Phaedo  than appears at first sight. The succession of arguments is based on  previous philosophies; beginning with the mysteries and the Heracleitean  alternation of opposites, and proceeding to the Pythagorean harmony and  transmigration; making a step by the aid of Platonic reminiscence, and  a further step by the help of the nous of Anaxagoras; until at last we  rest in the conviction that the soul is inseparable from the ideas,  and belongs to the world of the invisible and unknown. Then, as in  the Gorgias or Republic, the curtain falls, and the veil of mythology  descends upon the argument. After the confession of Socrates that he is  an interested party, and the acknowledgment that no man of sense will  think the details of his narrative true, but that something of the kind  is true, we return from speculation to practice. He is himself more  confident of immortality than he is of his own arguments; and the  confidence which he expresses is less strong than that which his  cheerfulness and composure in death inspire in us.    Difficulties of two kinds occur in the Phaedo--one kind to be explained  out of contemporary philosophy, the other not admitting of an entire  solution. (1) The difficulty which Socrates says that he experienced in  explaining generation and corruption; the assumption of hypotheses which  proceed from the less general to the more general, and are tested by  their consequences; the puzzle about greater and less; the resort to the  method of ideas, which to us appear only abstract terms,--these are to  be explained out of the position of Socrates and Plato in the history of  philosophy. They were living in a twilight between the sensible and  the intellectual world, and saw no way of connecting them. They  could neither explain the relation of ideas to phenomena, nor their  correlation to one another. The very idea of relation or comparison was  embarrassing to them. Yet in this intellectual uncertainty they had a  conception of a proof from results, and of a moral truth, which remained  unshaken amid the questionings of philosophy. (2) The other is a  difficulty which is touched upon in the Republic as well as in the  Phaedo, and is common to modern and ancient philosophy. Plato is not  altogether satisfied with his safe and simple method of ideas. He wants  to have proved to him by facts that all things are for the best, and  that there is one mind or design which pervades them all. But this  'power of the best' he is unable to explain; and therefore takes refuge  in universal ideas. And are not we at this day seeking to discover that  which Socrates in a glass darkly foresaw?    Some resemblances to the Greek drama may be noted in all the Dialogues  of Plato. The Phaedo is the tragedy of which Socrates is the protagonist  and Simmias and Cebes the secondary performers, standing to them in the  same relation as to Glaucon and Adeimantus in the Republic. No Dialogue  has a greater unity of subject and feeling. Plato has certainly  fulfilled the condition of Greek, or rather of all art, which requires  that scenes of death and suffering should be clothed in beauty. The  gathering of the friends at the commencement of the Dialogue, the  dismissal of Xanthippe, whose presence would have been out of place at  a philosophical discussion, but who returns again with her children to  take a final farewell, the dejection of the audience at the temporary  overthrow of the argument, the picture of Socrates playing with the  hair of Phaedo, the final scene in which Socrates alone retains his  composure--are masterpieces of art. And the chorus at the end might have  interpreted the feeling of the play: 'There can no evil happen to a good  man in life or death.'    'The art of concealing art' is nowhere more perfect than in those  writings of Plato which describe the trial and death of Socrates. Their  charm is their simplicity, which gives them verisimilitude; and yet  they touch, as if incidentally, and because they were suitable to the  occasion, on some of the deepest truths of philosophy. There is nothing  in any tragedy, ancient or modern, nothing in poetry or history (with  one exception), like the last hours of Socrates in Plato. The master  could not be more fitly occupied at such a time than in discoursing of  immortality; nor the disciples more divinely consoled. The arguments,  taken in the spirit and not in the letter, are our arguments; and  Socrates by anticipation may be even thought to refute some 'eccentric  notions; current in our own age. For there are philosophers among  ourselves who do not seem to understand how much stronger is the power  of intelligence, or of the best, than of Atlas, or mechanical force.  How far the words attributed to Socrates were actually uttered by him we  forbear to ask; for no answer can be given to this question. And it  is better to resign ourselves to the feeling of a great work, than to  linger among critical uncertainties.          PHAEDO      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:    Phaedo, who is the narrator of the dialogue to Echecrates of Phlius.  Socrates, Apollodorus, Simmias, Cebes, Crito and an Attendant of the  Prison.    SCENE: The Prison of Socrates.    PLACE OF THE NARRATION: Phlius.        ECHECRATES: Were you yourself, Phaedo, in the prison with Socrates on  the day when he drank the poison?    PHAEDO: Yes, Echecrates, I was.    ECHECRATES: I should so like to hear about his death. What did he say in  his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking poison, but no  one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens now, and it  is a long time since any stranger from Athens has found his way hither;  so that we had no clear account.    PHAEDO: Did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?    ECHECRATES: Yes; some one told us about the trial, and we could not  understand why, having been condemned, he should have been put to death,  not at the time, but long afterwards. What was the reason of this?    PHAEDO: An accident, Echecrates: the stern of the ship which the  Athenians send to Delos happened to have been crowned on the day before  he was tried.    ECHECRATES: What is this ship?    PHAEDO: It is the ship in which, according to Athenian tradition,  Theseus went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was  the saviour of them and of himself. And they were said to have vowed  to Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would send a yearly  mission to Delos. Now this custom still continues, and the whole period  of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo  crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is  not allowed to be polluted by public executions; and when the vessel  is detained by contrary winds, the time spent in going and returning  is very considerable. As I was saying, the ship was crowned on the day  before the trial, and this was the reason why Socrates lay in prison and  was not put to death until long after he was condemned.    ECHECRATES: What was the manner of his death, Phaedo? What was said or  done? And which of his friends were with him? Or did the authorities  forbid them to be present--so that he had no friends near him when he  died?    PHAEDO: No; there were several of them with him.    ECHECRATES: If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell me  what passed, as exactly as you can.    PHAEDO: I have nothing at all to do, and will try to gratify your wish.  To be reminded of Socrates is always the greatest delight to me, whether  I speak myself or hear another speak of him.    ECHECRATES: You will have listeners who are of the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#9)"],[1," of  thousands of dollars in banks and not a cent in their pocketbooks; men  able and eager to pay any price for the best accommodations to be had,  yet satisfied and happy sharing bunks in the steerage.    There were women who had lost all baggage and had come alone, their  friends and relatives being unable to get accommodations on the vessel.  There were children who had come on board with their mothers, with  neither money nor reservations, who were happy because they had received  the very best treatment from all the steamship's officers and crew and  because they had enjoyed the most comfortable quarters to be had,  surrendered by men who were content to sleep in most humble  surroundings, or, if necessary, as happened in a few cases, to sleep on  the decks when the weather permitted.    Wealthy, but without funds, many of the passengers gave jewelry to the  stewards and other employees of the steamship as the tips which they  assumed were expected even in times of stress. The crew took them  apologetically, some said they were content to take only the thanks of  the passengers. One woman of wealth and social position, without money,  and having lost her check book with her baggage, as had many others of  the passengers, gave a pair of valuable bracelets to her steward with  the request that he give them to his wife. She gave a hat--the only one  she managed to take with her on her flight from Switzerland--to her  stewardess.    The statue of Liberty never looked so beautiful to a party of Americans  before. The strains of the Star Spangled Banner, as they echoed over the  waters of the bay, were never sweeter nor more inspiring. As the  Philadelphia approached quarrantine, the notes of the American anthem  swelled until, as she slowed down to await the coming of the physicians  and customs officials, it rose to a great crescendo which fell upon the  ears of all within many hundred yards and brought an answering chorus  from the throngs who waited to extend their hands to relatives and  friends.    There was prophecy in the minds of men and women aboard that ship. Some  of them had been brought into actual contact with the war; others very  near it. In the minds of all was the vision that liberty, enlightenment  and all the fruits of progress were threatened; that if they were to be  saved, somehow, this land typified the spirit of succor; somehow the aid  was to proceed from here.    Liberty never had a more cherished meaning to men of this Republic. In  the minds of many the conviction had taken root, that if autocracy and  absolute monarchy were to be overthrown; that \"government of the people,  by the people, for the people\" should \"not perish from the earth,\" it  would eventually require from America that supreme sacrifice in devotion  and blood that at periods in the growth and development of nations, is  their last resort against the menace of external attack, and, regardless  of the reflections of theorists and philosophers, the best and surest  guarantee of their longevity; that the principles upon which they were  builded were something more than mere words, hollow platitudes, meaning  nothing, worthy of nothing, inspiring nothing. It was the dawning of a  day; new and strange in its requirements of America whose isolation and  policy, as bequeathed by the fathers, had kept it aloof from the  bickerings and quarrels of the nations that composed the \"Armed Camp\" of  Europe, during which, as subsequent events proved, the blood of the  Caucasian and the Negro would upon many a hard fought pass; many a  smoking trench in the battle zone of Europe, run together in one rivulet  of departing life, for the guarantee of liberty throughout all the  earth, and the establishment of justice at its uttermost bounds and  ends.          CHAPTER IV    AWAKENING OF AMERICA      PRESIDENT CLINGS TO NEUTRALITY--MONROE DOCTRINE AND WASHINGTON'S  WARNING--GERMAN CRIMES AND GERMAN VICTORIES--CARDINAL MERCIER'S  LETTER--MILITARY OPERATIONS--FIRST SUBMARINE ACTIVITIES--THE LUSITANIA  OUTRAGE--EXCHANGE OF NOTES--UNITED STATES AROUSED--ROLE OF PASSIVE  ONLOOKER BECOMES IRKSOME--FIRST MODIFICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF WASHINGTON  AND MONROE--OUR DESTINY LOOMS.      August 4,1914, President Wilson proclaimed the neutrality of the United  States. A more consistent attempt to maintain that attitude was never  made by a nation. In an appeal addressed to the American people on  August 18th, the president implored the citizens to refrain from \"taking  sides.\" Part of his utterance on that occasion was:         \"We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a       curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that       might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle       before another.         \"My thought is of America. I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest       wish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great       country of ours, which is, of course, the first in our thoughts and       in our hearts, should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a       nation fit beyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed       judgment, the dignity of self-control, the efficiency of       dispassionate action; a nation that neither sits in judgment upon       others, nor is disturbed in her own counsels, and which keeps       herself fit and free to do what is honest and disinterested and       truly serviceable for the peace of the world.\"    American poise had been somewhat disturbed over the treatment of  American tourists caught in Germany at the outbreak of the war. American  sentiment was openly agitated by the invasion of Belgium and the  insolent repudiation by Germany of her treaty obligations. The German  chancellor had referred to the treaty with Belgium as \"a scrap of  paper.\" These things had created a suspicion in American minds, having  to do with what seemed Germany's real and ulterior object, but in the  main the people of this county accepted the president's appeal in the  spirit in which it was intended and tried to live up to it, which  attitude was kept to the very limit of human forbearance.    A few editors and public men, mostly opposed to the president  politically, thought we were carrying the principle of neutrality too  far; that the violation of Belgium was a crime against humanity in  general and that if we did not at least protest against it, we would be  guilty of national stultification if not downright cowardice. Against  this view was invoked the time-honored principles of the Monroe Doctrine  and its great corollary, Washington's advice against becoming entangled  in European affairs. Our first president, in his farewell address,  established a precept of national conduct that up to the time we were  drawn into the European war, had become almost a principle of religion  with us. He said:         \"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to       believe me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to       constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign       influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican       government--Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have       none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in       frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign       to our concern. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to       implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes       of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her       friendships or enmities.\"    The Monroe Doctrine was a statement of principles made by President  Monroe in his famous message of December 2, 1823. The occasion of the  utterance was the threat by the so-called Holy Alliance to interfere  forcibly in South America with a view to reseating Spain in control of  her former colonies there. President Monroe, pointing to the fact that  it was a principle of American policy not to intermeddle in European  affairs, gave warning that any attempt by the monarchies of Europe \"to  extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere\" would be  considered by the United States \"as dangerous to our peace and safety.\"  This warning fell in line with British policy at the time and so proved  efficacious.
