COLONEL.    For that very reason you should withdraw.    OLDENDORF.    I can no longer do so; but there is still time for you.    COLONEL (_vehemently_).    Thunder and lightning, sir, I have said yes; I am not the man to cap  it with a no!    [_Both walk up and down._]    That appears to end it, Professor! My wishes are of no account to you;  I ought to have known that! We must go our separate ways. We have  become open opponents; let us be honest enemies--    OLDENDORF (_seizing the_ COLONEL'S _hand_).    Colonel, I consider this a most unfortunate day; for I see sad results  to follow. Rest assured that no circumstances can shake my love and  devotion for you.    COLONEL.    We are drawn up in line of battle, as it were. You mean to let  yourself be defeated by an old military man. You shall have your  desire.    OLDENDORF.    I ask your permission to tell Miss Ida of our conversation.    COLONEL (_somewhat uneasy_).    You had better not do that just now, Professor. An opportunity will  come in due time. At present the ladies are dressing. I myself will  say what is necessary.    OLDENDORF.    Farewell, Colonel, and think of me without hard feelings.    COLONEL.    I will try my best, Professor.    [_Exit_ OLDENDORF.]    He has not given in! What depths of ambition there are in these  scholars!    _Enter_ IDA, ADELAIDE.    IDA.    Was not that Edward's voice?    COLONEL.    Yes, my child.    ADELAIDE.    And he has gone away again! Has anything happened?    COLONEL.    Well, yes, girls. To make a long story short, Oldendorf does not  become member for this town, but I.    ADELAIDE} (_together_.) You, Colonel? IDA } You, father?    IDA.    Has Edward withdrawn?    ADELAIDE.    Is the election over?    COLONEL.    Neither one nor the other. Oldendorf has proved his much-vaunted  devotion to us by not withdrawing, and election day is not yet past.  But from what I hear there is no doubt that Oldendorf will be  defeated.    IDA.    And you, father, have come out before everybody as his opponent?    ADELAIDE.    And what did Oldendorf say to that, Colonel?    COLONEL.    Don't excite me, girls! Oldendorf was stubborn, otherwise he behaved  well, and as far as that is concerned all is in order. The grounds  which determined me to make the sacrifice are very weighty. I will  explain them to you more fully another time. The matter is decided; I  have accepted; let that suffice for the present.    IDA.    But, dear father--    COLONEL.    Leave me in peace, Ida, I have other things to think of. This evening  I am to speak in public; that is, so to say, the custom at such  elections. Don't worry, my child, we'll get the better of the  professor and his clique.    [_Exit_ COLONEL _toward the garden_. IDA _and_ ADELAIDE _stand facing  each other and wring their hands._]    IDA.    What do you say to that?    ADELAIDE.    You are his daughter--what do _you_ say?    IDA.    Not possible!--Father! Scarcely had he finished explaining to us  thoroughly what petty mantles ambition assumes in such elections--    ADELAIDE.    Yes, he described them right vividly, all the little wraps and cloaks  of vanity.    IDA.    And within an hour he lets them throw the cloak about himself. Why, it  is terrible! And if father is not elected? It was wrong of Edward not  to give in to father's weakness. Is that your love for me, Professor?  He, too, never thought of me!    ADELAIDE.    Shall I tell you what? Let us hope that they both fail. These  politicians! It was bad enough for you when only one was in politics;  now that both have tasted of the intoxicating drink you are done for.  Were I ever to come into a position to make a man my master, I should  impose upon him but one condition, the wise rule of conduct of my old  aunt: Smoke tobacco, my husband, as much as you please; at most it  will spoil the walls; but never dare to look at a newspaper--that will  spoil your character.    [KORB _appears at the door_.]    What news do you bring, Korb?    KORB (_hastily, mysteriously_).    It isn't true!    ADELAIDE (_the same_). What isn't true?    KORB.    That he has a fiancee. He has no idea of it. His friend says he has  but one lady-love.    ADELAIDE (_eagerly_).    Who is she?    KORB. His newspaper.      ADELAIDE (_relieved_).    Ah, indeed. (_Aloud_.)    One can see by that how many falsehoods people tell. It is good, dear  Korb.    [_Exit_ KORB.]    IDA. What isn't true?    ADELAIDE (_sighing_).    Well, that we women are cleverer than men. We talk just as wisely and  I fear are just as glad to forget our wisdom at the first opportunity.  We are all of us together poor sinners!    IDA.    You can joke about it. You never knew what it was to have your father  and the man you loved oppose each other as enemies.    ADELAIDE.    Do you think so! Well, I once had a good friend who had foolishly  given her heart to a handsome, high-spirited boy. She was a mere child  and it was a very touching relationship: knightly devotion on his part  and tender sighings on hers. Then the young heroine had the misfortune  to become very jealous, and so far forgot poetry and deportment as to  give her heart's chosen knight a box on the ear. It was only a little  box, but it had fateful consequences. The young lady's father had seen  it and demanded an explanation. Then the young knight acted like a  perfect hero. He took all the blame upon himself and told the alarmed  father that he had asked the young lady to kiss him--poor fellow, he  never had the courage for such a thing!--and the blow had been her  answer. A stern man was the father; he treated the lad very harshly.  The hero was sent away from his family and his home, and the heroine  sat lonely in her donjon-tower and mourned her lost one.    IDA.    She ought to have told her father the truth.    ADELAIDE.    Oh, she did. But her confession made matters only worse. Years have  gone by since then, and the knight and his lady are now old people and  have become quite sensible.    IDA (_smiling_).    And, because they are sensible, do they not love each other any  longer?    ADELAIDE.    How the man feels about it, dear child, I cannot tell you exactly. He  wrote the lady a very beautiful letter after the death of her  father--that is all I know about it. But the lady has greater  confidence than you, for she still hopes. (_Earnestly_.) Yes, she  hopes; and even her father permitted that before he died--you see, she  still hopes.    IDA (_embracing her_).    And who is the banished one for whom she still hopes?    ADELAIDE.    Hush, dearest, that is a dark secret. Few persons living know about  it; and when the birds on the trees of Rosenau tell each other the  story they treat it as a dim legend of their forefathers. They then  sing softly and sorrowfully, and their feathers stand on end with awe.  In due time you shall learn all about it; but now you must think of  the fete, and of how pretty you are going to look.    IDA.    On the one hand the father, on the other the lover--how will it end?    ADELAIDE.    Do not worry. The one is an old soldier, the other a young statesman;  two types that we women have wound around our little fingers from time  immemorial! [_Both leave_.]      SCENE II      _Side room of a public hall. The rear wall a great arch with columns,  through which one looks into the lighted hall and through it into another.  On the left, toward the front, a door. On the right, tables and chairs;  chandeliers. Later, from time to time distant music. In the hall ladies  and gentlemen walking about or standing in groups_. SENDEN, BLUMENBERG,  _behind them_ SCHMOCK _coming from the hall_.    SENDEN. All is going well. There is a splendid spirit in the company.  These good townspeople are delighted with our arrangements. It was a  fine idea of yours, Blumenberg, to have this fete.    BLUMENBEEG. Only hurry and get people warmed up! It's a good thing to  begin with some music. Vienna waltzes are best on account of the  women. Then comes a speech from you, then some solo singing, and, at  supper, the introduction of the Colonel, and the toasts. It can't help  being a success; the men must have hearts of stone if they don't give  their votes in return for such a fete.    SENDEN. The toasts have been apportioned.    BLUMENBERG. But the music?--Why has the music stopped?    SENDEN. I am waiting for the Colonel to arrive.    BLUMENBERG. He must be received with a blare of trumpets. It will  flatter him, you know.    SENDEN. That's what I ordered. Directly after, they start up a march  and we bring him in procession.    BLUMENBERG. First rate! That will lend solemnity to his entrance. Only  think up your speech. Be popular, for today we are among the rabble.    _Enter guests, among them_ HENNING.    SENDEN (_doing the honors with BLUMENBERG_). Delighted to see you  here! We knew that you would not fail us. Is this your wife?    GUEST. Yes, Mr. von Senden, this is my wife.    SENDEN. You here, too, Mr. Henning? Welcome, my dear sir!    HENNING. I was invited by my friend and really had the curiosity to  come. My presence, I hope, will not be unpleasant to any one?    SENDEN. Quite the contrary. We are most pleased to greet you here.    [_Guests leave through centre door_; SENDEN _goes out in conversation  with them._]    BLUMENBERG. He knows how to manage people. It's the good manners of  these gentlemen that does it. He is useful--useful to me too. He  manages the others, and I manage him. [_Turning, he sees_ SCHMOCK,  _who is hovering near the door_.] What are you doing here? Why do you  stand there listening? You are not a door-keeper! See that you keep  out of my vicinity. Divide yourself up among the company.    SCHMOCK. Whom shall I go to if I know none of these people at all? You  are the only person I know.    BLUMENBERG.

Some good views may be also obtained from some parts of Moseley  Road, Cannon Hill Park, and from Bearwood Road.    ~Birmingham.~--A horse of this name won the Doncaster St. Leger in 1830  against 27 competitors. The owner, John Beardsworth, cleared L40,000. He  gave Connolly, the jockey, L2,000.    ~Birmingham Abroad.~--Our brethren who have emigrated do not like to  forget even the name of their old town, and a glance over the American  and Colonial census sheet shows us that there are at least a score of  other Birminghams in the world. In New Zealand there are three, and in  Australia five townships so christened. Two can be found in Canada, and  ten or twelve in the United States, the chief of which is Birmingham in  Alabama. In 1870 this district contained only a few inhabitants, but in  the following year, with a population of 700, it was incorporated, and  at once took rank as a thriving city, now proudly called \"The Iron  City,\" from its numerous ironworks, furnaces, and mills. Last year the  citizens numbered over 12,000, the annual output of pig-iron being about  60,000 tons, and the coal mines in the neighbourhood turning out 2,000  tons per day. The city is 240 miles from Nashville, 143 miles from  Chattanooga, and 96 miles from Montgomery, all thriving places, and is a  central junction of six railways. The climate is good, work plentiful,  wages fair, provisions cheap, house rent not dear, churches and schools  abundant, and if any of our townsmen are thinking of emigrating they may  do a deal worse than go from hence to that other Birmingham, which its  own \"daily\" says is a \"City of marvellous wonder and magic growth,\" &c.,  &c.    ~Birmingham Begging.~--Liberal to others as a rule when in distress, it  is on record that once at least the inhabitants of this town were the  recipients of like favours at the hands of their fellow-countrymen. In  the churchwardens' books of Redenall, Norfolk, under date September 20,  1644, is an entry of 6s. paid \"to Richard Herbert, of Birmingham, where  was an hundred fifty and five dwelling house burnt by Pr. Rupert.\"    ~Birmingham Borough,~ which is in the hundred of Hemlingford, and wholly  in the county of Warwick, includes the parish of Birmingham, part of the  parish of Edgbaston, and the hamlets of Deritend-and-Bordesley, and  Duddeston-cum-Nechells, in the parish of Aston. The extreme length is  six miles one furlong, the average breadth three miles, the  circumference twenty-one miles, and the total area 8,420 acres, viz.,  Birmingham, 2,955; in Edgbaston, 2,512; and in Aston, 2,853. Divided  into sixteen wards by an Order in Council, approved by Her Majesty,  October 15, 1872. The mean level of Birmingham is reckoned as 443 feet  above sea level.    ~Birmingham Heath.~--Once an unenclosed common, and part of it may now  be said to be common property, nearly 100 acres of it being covered with  public buildings for the use of such as need a common home. There is  not, however, anything commonplace in the style of these erections for  sheltering our common infirmities, as the Workhouse, Gaol, and Asylum  combined have cost \"the Commons\" something like L350,000. The Volunteers  in 1798 made use of part of the Heath as a practice and parade ground.    ~Birmingham Bishops.~--The Rev. John Milner, a Catholic divine and  eminent ecclesiastical antiquary, who was educated at Edgbaston, was  appointed Bishop Apostolic in the Midland district, with the title of  \"Bishop of Castaballa.\" He died in 1826, in his 74th year.--Dr.  Ullathorne was enthroned at St. Chad's, August 30th, 1848, as Bishop of  the present Catholic diocese.--The Rev. P. Lee, Head Master of Free  Grammar School in 1839, was chosen as the first Bishop of Manchester.--  The Rev. S. Thornton, St. George's, was consecrated Bishop of Ballarat,  May 1, 1875.--The Rev. Edward White Benson, D.D., a native of this town,  was nominated first Bishop of Truro, in December, 1876, and is now  Archbishop of Canterbury.--The Rev. Thomas Huband Gregg resigned the  vicarage of East Harborne in March, 1877, and on June 20 was consecrated  at New York a Bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church.    ~Birmingham~ (~Little~).--In a record of the early date of 1313 there is  mention of a place called Little Birmingham (parvam Birmingham), as  being in the hundreds of North and South Erpyngham, Norfolk.    ~Birmingham in the Future.~--It has been proposed that the Borough  should be extended so as to include the Local Board districts of  Harborne and Handsworth, Balsall Heath, Moseley, King's Heath, part of  King's Norton parish, the whole of Yardley and Acock's Green, part of  Northfield parish, all Aston Manor, Saltley, Witton, Little Bromwich,  and Erdington, covering an area of about 32,000 acres, with a present  population of over half a million.    ~Blind Asylum.~--See \"_Philanthropic Institutions_.\"    ~Blondin~ made his first appearance at Aston Park, June 8, 1861; at the  Birmingham Concert Hall, December, 1869, and March, 1870; at the  Reservoir September, 1873, and September, 1878. Mrs. Powell, who was  known as the \"Female Blondin,\" was killed at a fete in Aston Park, July  20, 1868, by falling from the high rope.    ~Bloomsbury Institute.~--Opened in 1860. The memorial stones of the  lecture-hall in Bloomsbury Street were laid August 6, 1877, the L750  cost being given by Mr. David Smith. Seats 500.    ~Blue Coat School.~--See \"_Schools_.\"    ~Blues.~--The United Society of True Blues was founded in 1805 by a  number of old Blue Coat boys (formerly known as \"The Grateful Society\")  who joined in raising an annual subscription for the School.    ~Board Schools.~--See \"_School Board_.\"    ~Boatmen's Hall,~ erected on Worcester Wharf, by Miss Ryland, was opened  March 17, 1879.    ~Bonded Warehouses.~--Our Chamber of Commerce memoralised the Lords of  the Treasury for the extension of the bonded warehouse system to this  town, in December, 1858, but it was several years before permission was  obtained.    ~Books.~--The oldest known Birmingham book is a \"Latin Grammar, composed  in the English tongue,\" printed in London in 1652, for Thomas Underhill,  its author having been one of the masters of our Free School.    ~Book Club (The).~--Commenced some few years previous to 1775, at which  time its meetings were held in Poet Freeth's, Leicester Arms,  Bell-street. As its name implies, the club was formed for the purchase  and circulation among the members of new or choice books, which were  sold at the annual dinner, hence the poet's hint in one of his  invitations to these meetings:--      \"Due regard let the hammer be paid,      Ply the glass gloomy care to dispel;    If mellow our hearts are all made,      The books much better may sell.\"      In these days of cheap literature, free libraries, and halfpenny papers,  such a club is not wanted.    ~Books on Birmingham.~--Notes of Birmingham were now and then given  before the days of that dear old antiquary Hutton, but _his_ \"History\"  must always take rank as the first. Morfitt's was amusing as far as it  went; Bissett's was ditto and pictorial; but it remained till the  present period for really reliable sketches to be given. The best are  Langford's \"Century of Birmingham Life,\" Harman's \"Book of Dates,\"  Dent's \"Old and New Birmingham,\" Bunce's \"Municipal History,\" and the  last is \"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham.\"    ~Botanical Gardens.~--See \"_Horticultural Societies_.\"    ~Borough Members.~--See \"_Parliamentary Elections_.\"    ~Boulton (Mathew).~--The son of a hardware manufacturer of the same  name, was born here on September 3, 1728 (old style) and received his  education principally at the academy of the Rev. Mr. Anstey, Deritend.  He is accredited with having at the early age of seventeen invented the  inlaying of steel buckles, buttons and trinkets, which for many years  were in great request. These articles at first were exported to France  in large quantities, being afterwards brought from thence and sold in  London as the latest Parisian fashion. In 1762 (his father having left  him a considerable property) Mr. Boulton leased a quantity of the land  then forming part of Birmingham Heath, where at a cost of over L10,000  he erected the famous Soho Works, and later on (in 1794) he purchased  the freehold of that and a considerable tract of the adjoining land. In  1767 steam was first brought into use to supplement the power derived  from the water wheels, and in 1769 he became acquainted with James Watt,  with whom he afterwards went into partnership to make steam engines of  all kinds, sinking L47,000 before he had any return for his money. Mr.  Boulton lived to the patriarchal age of fourscore and one, leaving this  life on August 7, 1809. He was buried at Handsworth, 600 workmen,  besides numberless friends, following his remains; all of whom were  presented with hatbands and gloves and a silver medal, and regaled with  a dinner, the funeral costing altogether about L2,000.--See \"_Coinage_,\"  &c.    ~Bourne College,~ erected by the Primitive Methodists and their friends,  at Quinton, at a cost of nearly L10,00, was formally opened on October  240 [Transcriber's note: as original] 1882. When completed there will be  accommodation for 120 students.    ~Bowling Greens.~--These seem to have been favourite places of resort  with our grandfathers and great-grandfathers. The completion of one at  the Union Tavern, Cherry Street, was announced March 26, 1792, but we  read of another as attached to the Hen and Chickens, in High Street, as  early as 1741. There is a very fine bowling-green at Aston Hall, and  lovers of the old-fashioned game can be also accommodated at Cannon Hill  Park, and at several suburban hotels.    ~Boys' Refuge~ is at corner of Bradford Street and Alcester Street, and  the Secretary will be glad of help.    ~Boy"]]]
