As he did so from close at hand came the same call, now  louder, but identical with the one that had deceived him. It was an  answering signal, and had been given by Silvertip.    It flashed into Joe's mind that other savages were in the forest;  they had run across the Shawnees' trail, and were thus communicating  with them. Soon dark figures could be discerned against the patches  of green thicket; they came nearer and nearer, and now entered the  open glade where Silvertip stood with his warriors.    Joe counted twelve, and noted that they differed from his captors.  He had only time to see that this difference consisted in the  head-dress, and in the color and quantity of paint on their bodies,  when his gaze was attracted and riveted to the foremost figures.    The first was that of a very tall and stately chief, toward whom  Silvertip now advanced with every show of respect. In this Indian's  commanding stature, in his reddish-bronze face, stern and powerful,  there were readable the characteristics of a king. In his deep-set  eyes, gleaming from under a ponderous brow; in his mastiff-like jaw;  in every feature of his haughty face were visible all the high  intelligence, the consciousness of past valor, and the power and  authority that denote a great chieftain.    The second figure was equally striking for the remarkable contrast  it afforded to the chief's. Despite the gaudy garments, the paint,  the fringed and beaded buckskin leggins--all the Indian  accouterments and garments which bedecked this person, he would have  been known anywhere as a white man. His skin was burned to a dark  bronze, but it had not the red tinge which characterizes the Indian.  This white man had, indeed, a strange physiognomy. The forehead was  narrow and sloped backward from the brow, denoting animal instincts.  The eyes were close together, yellowish-brown in color, and had a  peculiar vibrating movement, as though they were hung on a pivot,  like a compass-needle. The nose was long and hooked, and the mouth  set in a thin, cruel line. There was in the man's aspect an  extraordinary combination of ignorance, vanity, cunning and  ferocity.    While the two chiefs held a short consultation, this  savage-appearing white man addressed the brothers.    \"Who're you, an' where you goin'?\" he asked gruffly, confronting  Jim.    \"My name is Downs. I am a preacher, and was on my way to the  Moravian Mission to preach to the Indians. You are a white man; will  you help us?\"    If Jim expected the information would please his interrogator, he  was mistaken.    \"So you're one of 'em? Yes, I'll do suthin' fer you when I git back  from this hunt. I'll cut your heart out, chop it up, an' feed it to  the buzzards,\" he said fiercely, concluding his threat by striking  Jim a cruel blow on the head.    Joe paled deathly white at this cowardly action, and his eyes, as  they met the gaze of the ruffian, contracted with their  characteristic steely glow, as if some powerful force within the  depths of his being were at white heat and only this pale flash came  to the surface.    \"You ain't a preacher?\" questioned the man, meeting something in  Joe's glance that had been absent from Jim's.    Joe made no answer, and regarded questioner steadily.    \"Ever see me afore? Ever hear of Jim Girty?\" he asked boastfully.    \"Before you spoke I knew you were Girty,\" answered Joe quietly.    \"How d'you know? Ain't you afeared?\"    \"Of what?\"    \"Me--me?\"    Joe laughed in the renegades face.    \"How'd you knew me?\" growled Girty. \"I'll see thet you hev cause to  remember me after this.\"    \"I figured there was only one so-called white man in these woods who  is coward enough to strike a man whose hands are tied.\"    \"Boy, ye're too free with your tongue. I'll shet off your wind.\"  Girty's hand was raised, but it never reached Joe's neck.    The big Indian had an hour or more previous cut Joe's bonds, but he  still retained the thong which was left attached to Joe's left  wrist. This allowed the young man free use of his right arm, which,  badly swollen or not, he brought into quick action.    When the renegade reached toward him Joe knocked up the hand, and,  instead of striking, he grasped the hooked nose with all the  powerful grip of his fingers. Girty uttered a frightful curse; he  writhed with pain, but could not free himself from the vise-like  clutch. He drew his tomahawk and with a scream aimed a vicious blow  at Joe. He missed his aim, however, for Silvertip had intervened and  turned the course of the keen hatchet. But the weapon struck Joe a  glancing blow, inflicting a painful, though not dangerous wound.    The renegade's nose was skinned and bleeding profusely. He was  frantic with fury, and tried to get at Joe; but Silvertip remained  in front of his captive until some of the braves led Girty into the  forest, where the tall chief had already disappeared.    The nose-pulling incident added to the gayety of the Shawnees, who  evidently were pleased with Girty's discomfiture. They jabbered  among themselves and nodded approvingly at Joe, until a few words  spoken by Silvertip produced a sudden change.    What the words were Joe could not understand, but to him they  sounded like French. He smiled at the absurdity of imagining he had  heard a savage speak a foreign language. At any rate, whatever had  been said was trenchant with meaning. The Indians changed from gay  to grave; they picked up their weapons and looked keenly on every  side; the big Indian at once retied Joe, and then all crowded round  the chief.    \"Did you hear what Silvertip said, and did you notice the effect it  had?\" whispered Jim, taking advantage of the moment.    \"It sounded like French, but of course it wasn't,\" replied Joe.    \"It was French. 'Le Vent de la Mort.'\"    \"By Jove, that's it. What does it mean?\" asked Joe, who was not a  scholar.    \"The Wind of Death.\"    \"That's English, but I can't apply it here. Can you?\"    \"No doubt it is some Indian omen.\"    The hurried consultation over, Silvertip tied Joe's horse and dog to  the trees, and once more led the way; this time he avoided the open  forest and kept on low ground. For a long time he traveled in the  bed of the brook, wading when the water was shallow, and always  stepping where there was the least possibility of leaving a  footprint. Not a word was spoken. If either of the brothers made the  lightest splash in the water, or tumbled a stone into the brook, the  Indian behind rapped him on the head with a tomahawk handle.    At certain places, indicated by the care which Silvertip exercised  in walking, the Indian in front of the captives turned and pointed  where they were to step. They were hiding the trail. Silvertip  hurried them over the stony places; went more slowly through the  water, and picked his way carefully over the soft ground it became  necessary to cross. At times he stopped, remaining motionless many  seconds.    This vigilance continued all the afternoon. The sun sank; twilight  spread its gray mantle, and soon black night enveloped the forest.  The Indians halted, but made no fire; they sat close together on a  stony ridge, silent and watchful.    Joe pondered deeply over this behavior. Did the Shawnees fear  pursuit? What had that Indian chief told Silvertip? To Joe it seemed  that they acted as if believing foes were on all sides. Though they  hid their tracks, it was, apparently, not the fear of pursuit alone  which made them cautious.    Joe reviewed the afternoon's march and dwelt upon the possible  meaning of the cat-like steps, the careful brushing aside of  branches, the roving eyes, suspicious and gloomy, the eager  watchfulness of the advance as well as to the rear, and always the  strained effort to listen, all of which gave him the impression of  some grave, unseen danger.    And now as he lay on the hard ground, nearly exhausted by the long  march and suffering from the throbbing wound, his courage lessened  somewhat, and he shivered with dread. The quiet and gloom of the  forest; these fierce, wild creatures, free in the heart of their own  wilderness yet menaced by a foe, and that strange French phrase  which kept recurring in his mind--all had the effect of conjuring up  giant shadows in Joe's fanciful mind. During all his life, until  this moment, he had never feared anything; now he was afraid of the  darkness. The spectral trees spread long arms overhead, and phantom  forms stalked abroad; somewhere out in that dense gloom stirred this  mysterious foe--the \"Wind of Death.\"    Nevertheless, he finally slept. In the dull-gray light of early  morning the Indians once more took up the line of march toward the  west. They marched all that day, and at dark halted to eat and rest.  Silvertip and another Indian stood watch.    Some time before morning Joe suddenly awoke. The night was dark, yet  it was lighter than when he had fallen asleep. A pale, crescent moon  shown dimly through the murky clouds. There was neither movement of  the air nor the chirp of an insect. Absolute silence prevailed.    Joe saw the Indian guard leaning against a tree, asleep. Silvertip  was gone. The captive raised his head and looked around for the  chief. There were only four Indians left, three on the ground and  one against the tree.    He saw something shining near him. He looked more closely, and made  out the object to be an eagle plume Silvertip had worn, in his  head-dress. It lay on the ground near the tree. Joe made some slight  noise which awakened the guard. The Indian never moved a muscle; but  his eyes roved everywhere. He, too, noticed the absence of the  chief.    At this moment from out of the depths of the woods came a swelling  sigh, like the moan of the night wind. It rose and died away,  leaving the silence apparently all the deeper.    A shudder ran over Joe's frame. Fascinated, he watched the guard.  The Indian uttered a low "]]]
