Captain Haldane, D.S.O., whom I had formerly known on Sir William  Lockhart's staff in the Tirah Expedition, and who was lately recovered  from his wound at Elandslaagte, commanded.    We started at half-past five and, observing all the usual precautions,  reached Frere Station in about an hour. Here a small patrol of the Natal  police reported that there were no enemy within the next few miles, and  that all seemed quiet in the neighbourhood. It was the silence before  the storm. Captain Haldane decided to push on cautiously as far as  Chieveley, near which place an extensive view of the country could be  obtained. Not a sign of the Boers could be seen. The rolling grassy  country looked as peaceful and deserted as on former occasions, and we  little thought that behind the green undulations scarcely three miles  away the leading commandos of a powerful force were riding swiftly  forward on their invading path.    All was clear as far as Chieveley, but as the train reached the station  I saw about a hundred Boer horsemen cantering southwards about a mile  from the railway. Beyond Chieveley a long hill was lined with a row of  black spots, showing that our further advance would be disputed. The  telegraphist who accompanied the train wired back to Estcourt reporting  our safe arrival, and that parties of Boers were to be seen at no great  distance, and Colonel Long replied by ordering the train to return to  Frere and remain there in observation during the day, watching its safe  retreat at nightfall. We proceeded to obey, and were about a mile and  three-quarters from Frere when on rounding a corner we saw that a hill  which commanded the line at a distance of 600 yards was occupied by the  enemy. So after all there would be a fight, for we could not pass this  point without coming under fire. The four sailors loaded their gun--an  antiquated toy--the soldiers charged their magazines, and the train,  which was now in the reverse of the order in which it had started moved,  slowly towards the hill.    The moment approached: but no one was much concerned, for the cars were  proof against rifle fire, and this ridge could at the worst be occupied  only by some daring patrol of perhaps a score of men. 'Besides,' we said  to ourselves, 'they little think we have a gun on board. That will be a  nice surprise.'    The Boers held their fire until the train reached that part of the track  nearest to their position. Standing on a box in the rear armoured truck  I had an excellent view-through my glasses. The long brown rattling  serpent with the rifles bristling from its spotted sides crawled closer  to the rocky hillock on which the scattered black figures of the enemy  showed clearly. Suddenly three wheeled things appeared on the crest, and  within a second a bright flash of light--like a heliograph, but much  yellower--opened and shut ten or twelve times. Then two much larger  flashes; no smoke nor yet any sound, and a bustle and stir among the  little figures. So much for the hill. Immediately over the rear truck of  the train a huge white ball of smoke sprang into being and tore out into  a cone like a comet. Then came, the explosions of the near guns and the  nearer shell. The iron sides of the truck tanged with a patter of  bullets. There was a crash from the front of the train and half a dozen  sharp reports. The Boers had opened fire on us at 600 yards with two  large field guns, a Maxim firing small shells in a stream, and from  riflemen lying on the ridge. I got down from my box into the cover of  the armoured sides of the car without forming any clear thought. Equally  involuntarily, it seems that the driver put on full steam, as the enemy  had intended. The train leapt forward, ran the gauntlet of the guns,  which now filled the air with explosions, swung round the curve of the  hill, ran down a steep gradient, and dashed into a huge stone which  awaited it on the line at a convenient spot.    To those who were in the rear truck there was only a tremendous shock, a  tremendous crash, and a sudden full stop. What happened to the trucks in  front of the engine is more interesting. The first, which contained the  materials and tools of the breakdown gang and the guard who was watching  the line, was flung into the air and fell bottom upwards on the  embankment. (I do not know what befell the guard, but it seems probable  that he was killed.) The next, an armoured car crowded with the Durban  Light Infantry, was carried on twenty yards and thrown over on its side,  scattering its occupants in a shower on the ground. The third wedged  itself across the track, half on and half off the rails. The rest of the  train kept to the metals.    We were not long left in the comparative peace and safety of a railway  accident. The Boer guns, swiftly changing their position, re-opened  from a distance of 1,300 yards before anyone had got out of the stage of  exclamations. The tapping rifle fire spread along the hillside, until it  encircled the wreckage on three sides, and a third field gun came into  action from some high ground on the opposite side of the line.    To all of this our own poor little gun endeavoured to reply, and the  sailors, though exposed in an open truck, succeeded in letting off three  rounds before the barrel was struck by a shell, and the trunnions, being  smashed, fell altogether out of the carriage.    The armoured truck gave some protection from the bullets, but since any  direct shell must pierce it like paper and kill everyone, it seemed  almost safer outside, and, wishing to see the extent and nature of the  damage, I clambered over the iron shield, and, dropping to the ground,  ran along the line to the front of the train. As I passed the engine  another shrapnel shell burst immediately, as it seemed, overhead,  hurling its contents with a rasping rush through the air. The driver at  once sprang out of the cab and ran to the shelter of the overturned  trucks. His face was cut open by a splinter, and he complained in bitter  futile indignation. He was a civilian. What did they think he was paid  for? To be killed by bombshells? Not he. He would not stay another  minute. It looked as if his excitement and misery--he was dazed by the  blow on his head--would prevent him from working the engine further, and  as only he understood the machinery all chances of escape seemed to be  cut off. Yet when I told this man that if he continued to stay at his  post he would be mentioned for distinguished gallantry in action, he  pulled himself together, wiped the blood off his face, climbed back into  the cab of his engine, and thereafter during the one-sided combat did  his duty bravely and faithfully--so strong is the desire for honour and  repute in the human breast.    I reached the overturned portion of the train uninjured. The volunteers  who, though severely shaken, were mostly unhurt, were lying down under  such cover as the damaged cars and the gutters of the railway line  afforded. It was a very grievous sight to see these citizen soldiers,  most of whom were the fathers of families, in such a perilous position.  They bore themselves well, though greatly troubled, and their major,  whose name I have not learned, directed their fire on the enemy; but  since these, lying behind the crests of the surrounding hills, were  almost invisible I did not expect that it would be very effective.    Having seen this much, I ran along the train to the rear armoured truck  and told Captain Haldane that in my opinion the line might be cleared.  We then agreed that he with musketry should keep the enemy's artillery  from destroying us, and that I should try to throw the wreckage off the  line, so that the engine and the two cars which still remained on the  rails might escape.    I am convinced that this arrangement gave us the best possible chance of  safety, though at the time it was made the position appeared quite  hopeless.    Accordingly Haldane and his Fusiliers began to fire through their  loopholes at the Boer artillery, and, as the enemy afterwards admitted,  actually disturbed their aim considerably. During the time that these  men were firing from the truck four shells passed through the armour,  but luckily not one exploded until it had passed out on the further  side. Many shells also struck and burst on the outside of their shields,  and these knocked all the soldiers on their backs with the concussion.  Nevertheless a well-directed fire was maintained without cessation.    The task of clearing the line would not, perhaps, in ordinary  circumstances have been a very difficult one. But the breakdown gang and  their tools were scattered to the winds, and several had fled along the  track or across the fields. Moreover, the enemy's artillery fire was  pitiless, continuous, and distracting. The affair had, however, to be  carried through.    The first thing to be done was to detach the truck half off the rails  from the one completely so. To do this the engine had to be moved to  slacken the strain on the twisted couplings. When these had been  released, the next step was to drag the partly derailed truck backwards  along the line until it was clear of the other wreckage, and then to  throw it bodily off the rails. This may seem very simple, but the dead  weight of the iron truck half on the sleepers was enormous, and the  engine wheels"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#9)"],[1,"author's \"Peregrine Scramble.\" Indeed, the \"Seven Years'  Service\" is a sort of continuation of that book, without the form of  fiction.           *       *       *       *       *    M. JULES LECHEVALIER, known in this country chiefly as one of the foreign  Correspondents of _The Tribune_, but in Europe as an able writer on the  Social Sciences, has recently delivered in Paris and Berlin, and in  London, (where he is residing as a political exile,) a series of  lectures, which will soon be given to the world in a volume, upon the  subject of his favorite studies. M. Lechevalier's system, which he  denominates \"New Political Economy,\" is based upon the principle of  association, in opposition to that of competition and _laissez-faire_,  which constitute the groundwork of the school of the present political  economists. In the course of his series he pointed out the gradual  tendency of the competitive principle to produce extremes of riches and  poverty, and ultimately revolutions, and maintained, that by the adoption  of the associative principle alone, society can be preserved from  confusion and destruction. He contends that the new political economy,  or _Socialism_, is essentially Conservative, while the present system of  unlimited competition, or buying cheap and selling dear, is destructive,  M. Lechevalier pretends to base his system on the moral principles of  Christ, and maintains that Christianity cannot be practically carried out  in any other way. His lectures abound in examples of the working of the  two opposing systems.           *       *       *       *       *    The Doctrinal Tract and Book Society, Boston, are going forward in the  work of re-publishing the old standard works of the New-England theology.  They have issued a fine edition of Bellamy and have procured an edition  of Edwards the younger. They are now about commencing the stereotyping of  Catlin's Compendium, and the whole works of Dr. Hopkins. We wish they  would go back a century further, and give us the best works of Mather and  his contemporaries.           *       *       *       *       *    There is a political novel by OTTO MULLER, of Manheim, announced, under  the title _Georg Volker: ein Vreiheits Roman_, which is said to give a  faithful picture of the Baden revolution, and to open with the rise of  the peasantry in the _Ottenwald_.            *       *       *       *      *    THE DUC DE LA ROUCHEFOUCAULD's celebrated \"Moral Reflections, Sentences,  and Maxims,\" have just appeared in a new and very much improved  translation, and with notes, pointing out similarities of sentiments in  ancient and modern authors, and sometimes proving that Rochefoucauld's  good things have been made use of without sufficient acknowledgment, by  moderns. There is also an introduction, which dissertates well on the  purpose and quality of the reflections. Such books were once very  popular; but in this country they have not been much read. We have indeed  had numerous editions of \"Lacon,\" and Dr. Bettner's \"Acton\" has found a  thousand purchasers; but the Rev. Dr. Hooker's \"Maxims,\" which, in our  opinion, are as good as anything of their kind in the English language,  we believe have not attracted attention, and Mr. Simms's \"Egeria\" has  been printed only in the columns of a newspaper.           *       *       *       *       *    A new theory has just been propounded at Paris in a book called  \"Armanase,\" (a Sanscrit word, meaning the \"Reign of Capacity\"). The author  asserts the present forms of administrative government are injurious  instead of useful to society, and ought to be replaced by institutions of  a new and different order. His principle is, that the sovereignty of the  individual ought to be instituted for that of governments, and that great  associations of mutual assurance may be advantageously substituted for  the existing system of management by office-holders. The author shows  also that the progress of the natural and mechanical sciences will  deliver man from the pressure of the more painful sorts of labor; and  that wealth, freed from the barriers which now hinder its circulation,  would be distributed freely throughout society. Intellectual property  would be seriously guaranteed, and would enrich the men of genius, whose  inventions and discoveries are now profitable, not to the authors, but to  the capitalists who take advantage of them. By this means an important  element of revolutions will be removed. The author proposes, that in  order to prevent all suffering, a civil list shall be set apart for the  people, who will be the king. This civil list is to be composed of a tax  of one per cent., levied on all who have property in favor of those who  have nothing. But, says he, let no one imagine that all would be  dissolution and ruin in this system, without law or government. Crimes  and offenses will be tried by juries, that is to say, by a living code.  Property will no longer be seizable for debt, and the courts will become  useless. Everybody shall have the absolute right to buy land by paying  its possessor ten per cent, on its value: this is to give a chance for  carrying on all sorts of grand public enterprises without trouble from  the proprietors of little pieces of land. It may perhaps be doubted,  whether the \"Reign of Capacity\" has exhibited any astonishing endowments  in that respect.           *       *       *       *       *    THACKERAY, in _Pendennis_, has given offense, it appears, to some of the  gensd'armes of the Press, by his satirical sketches of the literary  profession. Those whose withers are unwrung will admit the truth of many  pages and laugh at the caricature in the rest. In the last number of the  _North British Review_ is a clever article upon the subject, written with  good temper and good sense. Hitherto publishers have been ridiculed and  declaimed against as \"tyrants\" and \"tradesmen,\"--made to bear the onus of  \"poetical\" improvidence, and to sustain the weight of a crime which no  author can pardon--the rejection of manuscripts. The _authors_ have  painted the portraits of publishers; but an ancient fable suggests that  if the _lion_ had painted a certain picture, it would not have been a  lion we should see biting the dust.           *       *       *       *       *    M. DE LUYNES is now engaged at Paris in publishing a work on the  antiquities of Cyprus. He has discovered a number of inscriptions  in ancient Cyprian writing, and is having them engraved on copper. The  writing is that which preceded the introduction of the Phoenician  character upon the island, and seems to have no affinity either with that  or with the Assyrian, which is discovered to have been once used there.  The work of M. de Luynes will open a new problem for the philologists. It  will be difficult to decipher the inscriptions and language, unless there  can be found somewhere an ancient Cyprian inscription, with a translation  in some known tongue; but in a time which has read the riddles of the  pyramids, nothing of this sort is to be despaired of. M. de Luynes is the  last of the great French nobles who makes a worthy use of his riches.           *       *       *       *       *    SIR ROBERT PEEL left full and specific directions in his will for the  early publication of his political memoirs; and ordered that the profits  arising from the publication shall be given to some public institution  for the education of the working-classes.

He confided the task of preparing these memoirs to Lord  Mahon and Mr. Cardwell. Their duty will, however, be comparatively light,  though delicate, from the admirable and orderly state in which he left  his papers.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. JOHN P.

At the same time he treats his subject with  independence and originality, though he advances nothing for the sake of  novelty. The second part of the work will be devoted to the discussion of  the ancient inscriptions, dynasty by dynasty, and reign by reign.           *       *       *       *       *    WASHINGTON IRVING is claimed by the English as by both _birth_ and spirit  a British author.
