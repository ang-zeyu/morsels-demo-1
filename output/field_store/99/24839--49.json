This was  honestly as much as their heads could hold at one time; and they were  helplessly unable to consider whether the other conditions postulated by  Bernhardi were present, or indeed, in the excitement of their  schoolboyish imaginations, to remember whether he had postulated any at  all. And so they made their dash and put themselves in the wrong at  every point morally, besides making victory humanly impossible for  themselves militarily. That is the nemesis of Militarism: the Militarist  is thrown into a big game which he is too stupid to be able to play  successfully. Philip of Spain tried it 300 years ago; and the ruin he  brought on his empire has lasted to this day. He was so stupid that  though he believed himself to be the chosen instrument of God (as sure a  sign of a hopeless fool in a man who cannot see that every other man is  equally an instrument of that Power as it is a guarantee of wisdom and  goodwill in the man who respects his neighbor as himself) he attempted  to fight Drake on the assumption that a cannon was a weapon that no real  gentleman and good Catholic would condescend to handle. Louis XIV. tried  again two centuries ago, and, being a more frivolous fool, got beaten by  Marlborough and sent his great-grandson from the throne to the  guillotine. Napoleon tried it 100 years ago. He was more dangerous,  because he had prodigious personal ability and technical military skill;  and he started with the magnificent credential of the French Revolution.  All that carried him farther than the Spanish bigot or the French fop;  but he, too, accreted fools and knaves, and ended defeated in St. Helena  after pandering for twenty years to the appetite of idiots for glory and  bloodshed; waging war as \"a great game\"; and finding in a field strewn  with corpses \"un beau spectacle.\" In short, as strong a magnet to fools  as the others, though so much abler.      *Our Own True Position*.    Now comes the question, in what position did this result of a mad theory  and a hopelessly incompetent application of it on the part of Potsdam  place our own Government? It left us quite clearly in the position of  the responsible policeman of the west. There was nobody else in Europe  strong enough to chain \"the mad dog.\" Belgium and Holland, Norway and  Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland could hardly have been expected to take  that duty on themselves, even if Norway and Sweden had not good reason  to be anti-Russian, and the Dutch capitalists were not half convinced  that their commercial prosperity would be greater under German than  under native rule. It will not be contended that Spain could have done  anything; and as to Italy, it was doubtful whether she did not consider  herself still a member of the Triple Alliance. It was evidently England  or nobody. For England to have refrained, from hurling herself into the  fray, horse, foot, and artillery, was impossible from every point of  view. From the democratic point of view it would have meant an  acceptance of the pretension of which Potsdam, by attacking the French  Republic, had made itself the champion: that is, the pretension of the  Junker class to dispose of the world on Militarist lines at the expense  of the lives and limbs of the masses. From the international Socialist  point of view, it would have been the acceptance of the extreme  nationalist view that the people of other countries are foreigners, and  that it does not concern us if they choose to cut one another's throats.  Our Militarist Junkers cried \"If we let Germany conquer France it will  be our turn next.\" Our romantic Junkers added \"and serve us right too:  what man will pity us when the hour strikes for us, if we skulk now?\"  Even the wise, who loathe war, and regard it as such a dishonour and  disgrace in itself that all its laurels cannot hide its brand of Cain,  had to admit that police duty is necessary and that war must be made on  such war as the Germans had made by attacking France in an avowed  attempt to substitute a hegemony of cannon for the comity of nations.  There was no alternative. Had the Foreign Office been the International  Socialist Bureau, had Sir Edward Grey been Jaures, had Mr. Ramsay  MacDonald been Prime Minister, had Russia been Germany's ally instead of  ours, the result would still have been the same: we must have drawn the  sword to save France and smash Potsdam as we smashed and always must  smash Philip, Louis, Napoleon, _et hoc genus omne_.    The case for our action is thus as complete as any _casus belli_ is ever  likely to be. In fact its double character as both a democratic and  military (if not Militarist) case makes it too complete; for it enables  our Junkers to claim it entirely for themselves, and to fake it with  pseudo-legal justifications which destroy nine-tenths of our credit, the  military and legal cases being hardly a tenth of the whole: indeed, they  would not by themselves justify the slaughter of a single Pomeranian  grenadier. For instance, take the Militarist view that we must fight  Potsdam because if the Kaiser is victorious, it will be our turn next!  Well: are we not prepared to fight always when our turn comes? Why  should not we also depend on our navy, on the extreme improbability of  Germany, however triumphant, making two such terrible calls on her  people in the same generation as a war involves, on the sympathy of the  defeated, and on the support of American and European public opinion  when our turn comes, if there is nothing at stake now but the difference  between defeat and victory in an otherwise indifferent military  campaign? If the welfare of the world does not suffer any more by an  English than by a German defeat who cares whether we are defeated or  not? As mere competitors in a race of armaments and an Olympic game  conducted with ball cartridge, or as plaintiffs in a technical case of  international law (already decided against us in 1870, by the way, when  Gladstone had to resort to a new treaty made _ad hoc_ and lapsing at the  end of the war) we might as well be beaten as not, for all the harm that  will ensue to anyone but ourselves, or even to ourselves apart from our  national vanity. It is as the special constables of European life that  we are important, and can send our men to the trenches with the  assurance that they are fighting in a worthy cause. In short, the Junker  case is not worth twopence: the Democratic case, the Socialist case, the  International case is worth all it threatens to cost.      *The German Defence to Our Indictment.*    What is the German reply to this case? Or rather, how would the Germans  reply to it if their official Militarist and Kaiserist panjandrums had  the wit to find the effective reply? Undoubtedly they would say that our  Social-Democratic professions are all very fine, but that our conversion  to them is suspiciously sudden and recent. They would remark that it is  a little difficult for a nation in deadly peril to trust its existence  to a foreign public opinion which has not only never been expressed by  the people who really control England's foreign policy, but is flatly  opposed to all their known views and prejudices. They would ask why,  instead of making an _Entente_ with France and Russia and refusing to  give Germany any assurance concerning its object except that we would  not pledge ourselves to remain neutral if the Franco-Russian _Entente_  fell on Germany, we did not say straight out in 1912 (when they put the  question flatly to us), and again last July when Sazonoff urged us so  strongly to shew our hand, that if Germany attacked France we should  fight her, Russia or no Russia (a far less irritating and provocative  attitude), although we knew full well that an attack on France through  Belgium would be part of the German program if the Russian peril became  acute. They would point out that if our own Secretary for Foreign  Affairs openly disclaimed any knowledge of the terms of the  Franco-Russian alliance, it was hard for a German to believe that they  were wholly fit for publication. In short, they would say \"If you were  so jolly wise and well intentioned before the event, why did not your  Foreign Minister and your ambassadors in Berlin and Vienna and St.  Petersburg--we beg pardon, Petrograd--invite us to keep the peace and  rely on western public opinion instead of refusing us every pledge  except the hostile one to co-operate with France against us in the North  Sea, and making it only too plain to us that your policy was a Junker  policy as much as ours, and that we had nothing to hope from your  goodwill? What evidence had we that you were playing any other game than  this Militarist chess of our own, which you now so piously renounce, but  which none of you except a handful of Socialists whom you despise and  Syndicalists whom you imprison on Militarist pretexts has opposed for  years past, though it has been all over your Militarist anti-German  platforms and papers and magazines? Are your Social-Democratic  principles sincere, or are they only a dagger you keep up your sleeve to  stab us in the back when our two most formidable foes are trying to  garotte us? If so, where does your moral superiority come in, hypocrites  that you are? If not, why, we repeat, did you not make them known to all  the world, instead of making an ambush for us by your senseless  silence?\"    I see no reply to that except a frank confession that we did not know  our own minds; that we came to a knowledge of them only when Germany's  attack on France forced us to make them up at last; that though  doubtless a chronic state of perfect lucidity and long prevision on our  part would have been highly convenient, yet there is a good deal to be  said for the policy of not fording a stream until you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#9)"],[1,"he's running  yet!\"    He knew that Koku would say nothing regarding the incident. The giant  had wonderful powers of silence! He sometimes went days without  speaking even to Rad. And that was one of the sources of irritation  between the voluble colored man and the giant.    \"'Tain't human,\" Rad often said, \"for nobody to say nothin' as much as  dat Koku does. Why, lawsy me! if he was tongue-tied an' speechless, an'  a deaf an' dumb mute, he couldn't say nothin' more obstreperously dan  he does--no sir! 'Tain't human.\"    So Tom had not to warn the giant not to chatter about meeting the  stranger on the road to Waterfield. If that person with dried red mud  on his boots was the spy who had followed Mr. Richard Bartholomew East  and was engaged by Montagne Lewis to interfere with any attempt the  president of the H. & P. A. might make to pull his railroad out of the  financial quagmire into which it was rapidly sinking, Tom would have  preferred to have the spy not suspect that he had been identified after  his fiasco of the previous evening.    For if this Western looking fellow was Andy O'Malley, whose name had  been mentioned by the railroad man, he was the person who had robbed  Tom of his wallet and had afterward attempted reprisal upon the young  inventor because the robbery had resulted in no gain to the robber.    Of course, the fellow had been unable to read Tom's shorthand notes of  the agreement that he had discussed with Mr. Bartholomew. Just what the  nature of that agreement was, would be a matter of interest to the  spy's employer.    Having failed in this attempt to learn something which was not his  business, the spy might make other and more serious attempts to learn  the particulars of the agreement between the railroad president and the  Swifts. Tom was sorry that the fellow had now been forewarned that his  identity as the spy and footpad was known to Tom and his friends.    Koku had made a bad mess of it. But Tom determined to say nothing to  his father regarding the discovery he had made. He did not want to  worry Mr. Swift. He meant, however, to redouble precautions at the  Swift Construction Company against any stranger getting past the  stockade gates.    Arrived at Mr. Damon's home in Waterfield, Tom got quickly to work on  the little job he had come to do for his old friend. Of course, Tom  might have sent two of his mechanics from the works down here to  electrify the barbed wire entanglements that Mr. Damon had erected  around his chicken run. But the young inventor knew that his eccentric  friend would not consider the job done right unless Tom attended to it  personally.    \"Bless my cracked corn and ground bone mixture!\" ejaculated the chicken  fancier. \"We'll show these night-prowlers what's what, I guess. One of  my neighbors was robbed last night. And I would have been if I hadn't  set a watch while I drove over to see you, Tom. Bless my spurs and  hackles! but these thieves are getting bold.\"    \"We'll fix 'em,\" said Tom, cheerfully, while Koku brought the tools and  wire to the hen run. \"After we link up your supply of the current with  this wire fence it will be an unhappy chicken burglar who interferes  with it.\"    \"That was an unhappy fellow who got your charge of ammonia last  evening,\" whispered Mr. Damon. \"Heard anything more of him?\"    \"I think I have seen him. But Koku spoiled everything by trying to eat  him up,\" and Tom laughingly related what had occurred on the way from  Shopton.    \"Bless my boots!\" said Mr. Damon. \"You'd better see the police, Tom.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Why, they ought to know about such a fellow lurking about Shopton. If  he followed that Western railroad president here--\"    \"We'll hope that he will follow Mr. Bartholomew away again,\" chuckled  Tom. \"Mr. Bartholomew won't stay over today. When that chap finds he  has gone he probably will consider that there is no use in his  bothering me any further.\"    Whether Tom believed this statement or not, he was destined to realize  his mistake within a very short time. At least, the fact that he was  being spied upon and that the enemy meant him anything but good, seemed  proved beyond a doubt that very week.    Having done the little job for Mr. Damon, Tom allowed no other outside  matter to take up his attention. He shut himself into his private  experimental workshop and laboratory at the works each day. He did not  even come out for lunch, letting Rad bring him down some sandwiches and  a thermos bottle of cool milk.    \"The young boss is milling over something new,\" the men said, and  grinned at each other. They were proud of Tom and faithful to his  interests.    Time was when there had been traitors in the works; but unfaithful  hands had been weeded out. There was not a man who drew a pay envelope  from the Swift Construction Company who would not have done his best to  save Tom and his father trouble. Such a thing as a strike, or labor  troubles of any kind, was not thought of there.    So Tom knew that whatever he did, or whatever plans he drew, in his  private room, he was safely guarded. Yet he always took a portfolio  home with him at night, for after dinner he frequently continued his  work of the day. Naturally during this first week he did not get far in  any problem connected with the proposed electric locomotive. There  were, however, rough drafts and certain schedules that had to do with  the matter jotted down.    It was almost twelve at night. Tom had sat up in his own room after his  father had retired, and after the household was still.    Eradicate was in bed and snoring under the roof, Tom knew. Just where  Koku was, it would have been hard to tell. Although a fine and  penetrating rain was falling, the giant might be roaming about the  waste land surrounding the stockade of the works. The elements had no  terrors for him.    Tom locked his portfolio and stepped into his bathroom to wash his  hands before retiring. Before he snapped on the electric light over the  basin he chanced to glance through the newly set windowpane which had  replaced the one Rad had shattered in escaping threatened impalement on  Koku's spear.    Although the clouds were thick and the rain was falling, there was a  certain humid radiance upon the roof of the porch under the bathroom  window. At least, the wet roof glistened so that any moving figure on  or beyond it was visible.    \"What's that?\" muttered Tom, and he sank down lower than the sill and  crept slowly to the window. He merely raised himself until his eyes  were on a level with the sill.    Coming up over the edge of the porch roof was a bulky figure.  It was  so dimly outlined at first that Tom could scarcely be sure that it was  that of a man.    However, it was not possible that any creature but a man would be able  to mount the lattice supporting the honeysuckle vines and so creep out  upon the porch roof. Once making secure his footing, the enemy in the  dark approached directly the bathroom window at which Tom crouched.          Chapter IX    Where was Koku?      Tom reached up swiftly and pushed over the lever that locked the two  window sashes. In doing this he set his own patent burglar alarm. If  that lever was turned back again, or broken, the buzzers would be set  ringing all over the house, and in Koku's room over the garage.    He did not believe that the marauder on the roof of the porch could  have seen the flash of his shirt-sleeved arm. But he took no chance of  being observed from outside by rising to his feet.    On his hands and knees he crept away from the window, and out of the  bathroom. Once there, he stood up, grabbed the portfolio, and without  coat or vest and as he was, dashed out of the bedroom. He had been  positive that nobody but himself was astir in the big house, and he was  right.    He did not punch the light button when he entered the library.  He knew  where to put his hand upon an electric torch in the table drawer, and  he gained possession of this.    Then he went to the safe and twirled the knob and watched the indicator  find the four numbers which were the \"open sesame\" to the burglar and  fire-proof door.    He flung the portfolio into the inner compartment, closed both doors,  and twirled the combination-knob. Then Tom tiptoed to the foot of the  front stairs to listen. He could hear no sound from above.    He did not want his father to be startled, if the enemy did break in;  and he knew that old Rad, awakened out of a sound sleep, would be worse  than useless at such a time.    After all, the giant, Koku, was his main dependence under these  circumstances. Tom crept to the outer door, opened it carefully, and  slipped out, letting the spring lock click behind him. For the first  time he realized that he was in his shirt and trousers and wore only  felt slippers on his feet.    But he was locked out now. He had no key. He must run the risk of the  fine rain and the chill of the night air.    He stepped off the end of the porch and ran around the house.  It was  to the roof of the rear porch that the marauder had climbed. But peer  as he might from down in the yard, Tom could see no moving figure up  there near the bathroom window. It was pitch dark against the wall of  the house.    He turned to glance up at the window of the sleeping room over the  garage where Koku was supposed to spend the night. But Tom knew the  giant was seldom there during the dark hours. He was as much of a  night-prowler as a wildcat or an owl.    There was no light there in any case. But Koku did not use a light  much. He could see in the dark, like a wild animal. Tom did not want to  call him. If he must have Koku's help, he would have to climb the  stairs to his bedside. The giant always aroused as wide awake as at  noonday.    But while the young inventor hesitated a sudden, but muffled, snap--the  breaking of metal--sounded. Tom knew instantly the direction from which  the sound came.    Although he"]]]
