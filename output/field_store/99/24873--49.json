Perhaps she thought  we were again going to lock her up on the steamer, or perhaps that  it was a friendly game, for she ran from us as fast as from the  black boys. In Matadi no one ever had crossed the parade ground  except at a funeral march, and the spectacle of two large white  men playing tag with a small fox-terrier attracted an immense  audience. The officials and clerks left work and peered between the  iron-barred windows, the \"prisoners\" in chains ceased breaking rock  and stared dumbly from the barracks, the black \"sentries\" shrieked  and gesticulated, the naked bush boys, in from a long caravan  journey, rose from the side of their burdens and commented upon our  manoeuvres in gloomy, guttural tones. I suspect they thought we  wanted Fanny for \"chop.\" Finally Fanny ran into the legs of a German  trader, who grabbed her by the neck and held her up to us.    \"You want him? Hey?\" he shouted.    \"Ay, man,\" gasped Burton, now quite purple, \"did you think we were  trying to amuse the dog?\"    I made a leash of my belt, and the captain returned to the ship  dragging his prisoner after him. An hour later I met the youthful  missionary leading Fanny by a rope.    \"I must tell you about Fanny,\" he cried. \"After I took her to the  Mission I forgot to tie her up--as I suppose I should have done--and  she ran away. But, would you believe it, she found her way straight  back to the ship. Was it not intelligent of her?\"    I was too far gone with apoplexy, heat prostration, and sunstroke to  make any answer, at least one that I could make to a missionary.    The next morning Fanny, the young missionary, and I left for  Leopoldville on the railroad. It is a narrow-gauge railroad built  near Matadi through the solid rock and later twisting and turning so  often that at many places one can see the track on three different  levels. It is not a State road, but was built and is owned by a  Dutch company, and, except that it charges exorbitant rates and does  not keep its carriages clean, it is well run, and the road-bed is  excellent. But it runs a passenger train only three times a week,  and though the distance is so short, and though the train starts at  6:30 in the morning, it does not get you to Leopoldville the same  day. Instead, you must rest over night at Thysville and start at  seven the next morning. That afternoon at three you reach  Leopoldville. For the two hundred and fifty miles the fare is two  hundred francs, and one is limited to sixty pounds of luggage. That  was the weight allowed by the Japanese to each war correspondent,  and as they gave us six months in Tokio in which to do nothing else  but weigh our equipment, I left Matadi without a penalty. Had my  luggage exceeded the limit, for each extra pound I would have had to  pay the company ten cents. To the Belgian officers and agents who go  for three years to serve the State in the bush the regulation is  especially harsh, and in a company so rich, particularly mean. To  many a poor officer, and on the pay they receive there are no rich  ones, the tax is prohibitive. It forces them to leave behind  medicines, clothing, photographic supplies, all ammunition, which  means no chance of helping out with duck and pigeon the daily menu  of goat and tinned sausages, and, what is the greatest hardship, all  books. This regulation, which the State permitted to the  concessionaires of the railroad, sends the agents of the State into  the wilderness physically and mentally unequipped, and it is no  wonder the weaker brothers go mad, and act accordingly.    My black boys travelled second-class, which means an open car with  narrow seats very close together and a wooden roof. On these cars  passengers are allowed twenty pounds of luggage and permitted to  collect two hundred and fifty miles of heat and dust. To a black boy  twenty pounds is little enough, for he travels with much more  baggage than an average \"blanc.\" I am not speaking of the Congo boy.  All the possessions the State leaves him he could carry in his  pockets, and he has no pockets. But wherever he goes the Kroo boy,  Mendi boy, or Sierra Leone boy carries all his belongings with him  in a tin trunk painted pink, green, or yellow. He is never separated  from his \"box,\" and the recognized uniform of a Kroo boy at work, is  his breechcloth, and hanging from a ribbon around his knee, the key  to his box. If a boy has no box he generally carries three keys.    In the first-class car were three French officers en route to  Brazzaville, the capital of the French Congo, and a dog, a sad  mongrel, very dirty, very hungry. On each side of the tiny toy car  were six revolving-chairs, so the four men, not to speak of the dog,  quite filled it. And to our own bulk each added hand-bags, cases of  beer, helmets, gun-cases, cameras, water-bottles, and, as the road  does not supply food of any kind, his chop-box. A chop-box is  anything that holds food, and for food of every kind, for the hours  of feeding, and the verb \"to feed,\" on the West Coast, the only  word, the \"lazy\" word, is \"chop.\"    The absent-minded young missionary, with Fanny jammed between his  ankles, and looking out miserably upon the world, and two other  young missionaries, travelled second-class.    They were even more crowded together than were we, but not so much  with luggage as with humanity. But as a protest against the high  charges of the railroad the missionaries always travel in the open  car. These three young men were for the first time out of England,  and in any fashion were glad to start on their long journey up the  Congo to Bolobo. To them whatever happened was a joke. It was a joke  even when the colored \"wife\" of one of the French officers used the  broad shoulders of one of them as a pillow and slept sweetly. She  was a large, good-natured, good-looking mulatto, and at the frequent  stations the French officer ran back to her with \"white man's chop,\"  a tin of sausages, a pineapple, a bottle of beer. She drank the  beer from the bottle, and with religious tolerance offered it to the  Baptists. They assured her without the least regret that they were  teetotalers. To the other blacks in the open car the sight of a  white man waiting on one of their own people was a thrilling  spectacle. They regarded the woman who could command such services  with respect. It would be interesting to know what they thought of  the white man. At each station the open car disgorged its occupants  to fill with water the beer bottle each carried, and to buy from the  natives kwango, the black man's bread, a flaky, sticky flour that  tastes like boiled chestnuts; and pineapples at a franc for ten. And  such pineapples! Not hard and rubber-like, as we know them at home,  but delicious, juicy, melting in the mouth like hothouse grapes,  and, also, after each mouthful, making a complete bath necessary.  One of the French officers had a lump of ice which he broke into  pieces and divided with the others. They saluted magnificently many  times, and as each drowned the morsel in his tin cup of beer, one of  them cried with perfect simplicity: \"C'est Paris!\" This reminded me  that the ship's steward had placed much ice in my chop basket, and I  carried some of it to another car in which were five of the White  Sisters. For nineteen days I had been with them on the steamer, but  they had spoken to no one, and I was doubtful how they would accept  my offering. But the Mother Superior gave permission, and they took  the ice through the car window, their white hoods bristling with the  excitement of the adventure. They were on their way to a post still  two months' journey up the river, nearly to Lake Tanganyika, and for  three years or, possibly, until they died, that was the last ice  they would see.    At Bongolo station the division superintendent came in the car and  everybody offered him refreshment, and in return he told us, in the  hope of interesting us, of a washout, and then casually mentioned  that an hour before an elephant had blocked the track. It seemed so  much too good to be true that I may have expressed some doubt, for  he said: \"Why, of course and certainly. Already this morning one was  at Sariski Station and another at Sipeto.\" And instead of looking  out of the window I had been reading an American magazine, filched  from the smoking-room, which was one year old!    At Thysville the railroad may have opened a hotel, but when I was  there to hunt for a night's shelter it turned you out bag and  baggage. The French officers decided to risk a Portuguese trading  store known as the \"Ideal Hotel,\" and the missionaries very kindly  gave me the freedom of their Rest House. It is kept open for  those of the Mission who pass between the Upper and Lower Congo.  At the station the young missionaries were met by two older  missionaries--Mr. Weekes, who furnished the \"Commission of Enquiry\"  with much evidence, which they would not, or were not allowed to,  print, and Mr. Jennings. With them were twenty \"boys\" from the  Mission and, with each of them carrying a piece of our baggage on  his head, we climbed the hill, and I was given a clean, comfortable,  completely appointed bedroom. Our combined chop we turned over to a  black brother. He is the custodian of the Rest House and an  excellent cook. While he was preparing it my boys spread out my  folding rubber tub. Had I closed the door I should have smothered,  so, in the presence of twenty interested black Baptists, I took an  embarrassing but one of the most necessary baths I can remember.    There still was a piece of the ice remaining, and as the interest in  the bathtub had begun to drag I handed it to one of my audience. He  yelled as though I had thrust into his hand a drop of vitriol, and,  leaping in the air, threw the ice on the floor and dared any one to  touch it. From the \"personal\" boys who had travelled to Matadi the  Mission boys had heard of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#9)"],[1,"to Beatrice that Ursula and I are  talking about her in the orchard.\"    Having said this, she felt as sure that Beatrice would overhear what was  meant for her ears as if she had made an appointment with her cousin.    In the orchard was a bower, screened from the sun by honeysuckles, and  Beatrice entered it a few minutes after Margaret had gone on her errand.    \"But are you sure,\" asked Ursula, who was one of Hero's attendants,  \"that Benedick loves Beatrice so devotedly?\"    \"So say the Prince and my betrothed,\" replied Hero, \"and they wished me  to tell her, but I said, 'No! Let Benedick get over it.'\"    \"Why did you say that?\"    \"Because Beatrice is unbearably proud. Her eyes sparkle with disdain and  scorn. She is too conceited to love. I should not like to see her making  game of poor Benedick's love. I would rather see Benedick waste away  like a covered fire.\"    \"I don't agree with you,\" said Ursula. \"I think your cousin is too  clear-sighted not to see the merits of Benedick.\" \"He is the one man in  Italy, except Claudio,\" said Hero.    The talkers then left the orchard, and Beatrice, excited and tender,  stepped out of the summer-house, saying to herself, \"Poor dear Benedick,  be true to me, and your love shall tame this wild heart of mine.\"    We now return to the plan of hate.    The night before the day fixed for Claudio's wedding, Don John entered  a room in which Don Pedro and Claudio were conversing, and asked Claudio  if he intended to be married to-morrow.    \"You know he does!\" said Don Pedro.    \"He may know differently,\" said Don John, \"when he has seen what I will  show him if he will follow me.\"    They followed him into the garden; and they saw a lady leaning out of  Hero's window talking love to Borachio.    Claudio thought the lady was Hero, and said, \"I will shame her for it  to-morrow!\" Don Pedro thought she was Hero, too; but she was not Hero;  she was Margaret.    Don John chuckled noiselessly when Claudio and Don Pedro quitted the  garden; he gave Borachio a purse containing a thousand ducats.    The money made Borachio feel very gay, and when he was walking in the  street with his friend Conrade, he boasted of his wealth and the giver,  and told what he had done.    A watchman overheard them, and thought that a man who had been paid a  thousand ducats for villainy was worth taking in charge. He therefore  arrested Borachio and Conrade, who spent the rest of the night in  prison.    Before noon of the next day half the aristocrats in Messina were at  church. Hero thought it was her wedding day, and she was there in her  wedding dress, no cloud on her pretty face or in her frank and shining  eyes.    The priest was Friar Francis.    Turning to Claudio, he said, \"You come hither, my lord, to marry this  lady?\" \"No!\" contradicted Claudio.    Leonato thought he was quibbling over grammar. \"You should have said,  Friar,\" said he, \"'You come to be married to her.'\"    Friar Francis turned to Hero. \"Lady,\" he said, \"you come hither to be  married to this Count?\" \"I do,\" replied Hero.    \"If either of you know any impediment to this marriage, I charge you to  utter it,\" said the Friar.    \"Do you know of any, Hero?\" asked Claudio. \"None,\" said she.    \"Know you of any, Count?\" demanded the Friar. \"I dare reply for him,  'None,'\" said Leonato.    Claudio exclaimed bitterly, \"O! what will not men dare say! Father,\"  he continued, \"will you give me your daughter?\" \"As freely,\" replied  Leonato, \"as God gave her to me.\"    \"And what can I give you,\" asked Claudio, \"which is worthy of this  gift?\" \"Nothing,\" said Don Pedro, \"unless you give the gift back to the  giver.\"    \"Sweet Prince, you teach me,\" said Claudio. \"There, Leonato, take her  back.\"    These brutal words were followed by others which flew from Claudio, Don  Pedro and Don John.    The church seemed no longer sacred. Hero took her own part as long as  she could, then she swooned. All her persecutors left the church, except  her father, who was befooled by the accusations against her, and cried,  \"Hence from her! Let her die!\"    But Friar Francis saw Hero blameless with his clear eyes that probed the  soul. \"She is innocent,\" he said; \"a thousand signs have told me so.\"    Hero revived under his kind gaze. Her father, flurried and angry, knew  not what to think, and the Friar said, \"They have left her as one dead  with shame. Let us pretend that she is dead until the truth is declared,  and slander turns to remorse.\"    \"The Friar advises well,\" said Benedick. Then Hero was led away into a  retreat, and Beatrice and Benedick remained alone in the church.    Benedick knew she had been weeping bitterly and long. \"Surely I do  believe your fair cousin is wronged,\" he said. She still wept.    \"Is it not strange,\" asked Benedick, gently, \"that I love nothing in the  world as well as you?\"    \"It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing as well as you,\" said  Beatrice, \"but I do not say it. I am sorry for my cousin.\"    \"Tell me what to do for her,\" said Benedick. \"Kill Claudio.\"    \"Ha! not for the wide world,\" said Benedick. \"Your refusal kills me,\"  said Beatrice. \"Farewell.\"    \"Enough! I will challenge him,\" cried Benedick.    During this scene Borachio and Conrade were in prison. There they were  examined by a constable called Dogberry.    The watchman gave evidence to the effect that Borachio had said that he  had received a thousand ducats for conspiring against Hero.    Leonato was not present at this examination, but he was nevertheless now  thoroughly convinced Of Hero's innocence. He played the part of bereaved  father very well, and when Don Pedro and Claudio called on him in a  friendly way, he said to the Italian, \"You have slandered my child to  death, and I challenge you to combat.\"    \"I cannot fight an old man,\" said Claudio.    \"You could kill a girl,\" sneered Leonato, and Claudio crimsoned.    Hot words grew from hot words, and both Don Pedro and Claudio were  feeling scorched when Leonato left the room and Benedick entered.    \"The old man,\" said Claudio, \"was like to have snapped my nose off.\"    \"You are a villain!\" said Benedick, shortly. \"Fight me when and with  what weapon you please, or I call you a coward.\"    Claudio was astounded, but said, \"I'll meet you. Nobody shall say I  can't carve a calf's head.\"    Benedick smiled, and as it was time for Don Pedro to receive officials,  the Prince sat down in a chair of state and prepared his mind for  justice.    The door soon opened to admit Dogberry and his prisoners.    \"What offence,\" said Don Pedro, \"are these men charged with?\"    Borachio thought the moment a happy one for making a clean breast of it.  He laid the whole blame on Don John, who had disappeared. \"The lady Hero  being dead,\" he said, \"I desire nothing but the reward of a murderer.\"    Claudio heard with anguish and deep repentance.    Upon the re-entrance of Leonato be said to him, \"This slave makes clear  your daughter's innocence. Choose your revenge.    \"Leonato,\" said Don Pedro, humbly, \"I am ready for any penance you may  impose.\"    \"I ask you both, then,\" said Leonato, \"to proclaim my daughter's  innocence, and to honor her tomb by singing her praise before it. As for  you, Claudio, I have this to say: my brother has a daughter so like Hero  that she might be a copy of her. Marry her, and my vengeful feelings  die.\"    \"Noble sir,\" said Claudio, \"I am yours.\" Claudio then went to his room  and composed a solemn song. Going to the church with Don Pedro and his  attendants, he sang it before the monument of Leonato's family. When he  had ended he said, \"Good night, Hero. Yearly will I do this.\"    He then gravely, as became a gentleman whose heart was Hero's, made  ready to marry a girl whom he did not love. He was told to meet her in  Leonato's house, and was faithful to his appointment.    He was shown into a room where Antonio (Leonato's brother) and several  masked ladies entered after him. Friar Francis, Leonato, and Benedick  were present.    Antonio led one of the ladies towards Claudio.    \"Sweet,\" said the young man, \"let me see your face.\"    \"Swear first to marry her,\" said Leonato.    \"Give me your hand,\" said Claudio to the lady; \"before this holy friar I  swear to marry you if you will be my wife.\"    \"Alive I was your wife,\" said the lady, as she drew off her mask.    \"Another Hero!\" exclaimed Claudio.    \"Hero died,\" explained Leonato, \"only while slander lived.\"    The Friar was then going to marry the reconciled pair, but Benedick  interrupted him with, \"Softly, Friar; which of these ladies is  Beatrice?\"    Hereat Beatrice unmasked, and Benedick said, \"You love me, don't you?\"    \"Only moderately,\" was the reply. \"Do you love me?\"    \"Moderately,\" answered Benedick.    \"I was told you were well-nigh dead for me,\" remarked Beatrice.    \"Of you I was told the same,\" said Benedick.    \"Here's your own hand in evidence of your love,\" said Claudio, producing  a feeble sonnet which Benedick had written to his sweetheart. \"And  here,\" said Hero, \"is a tribute to Benedick, which I picked out of the  pocket of Beatrice.\"    \"A miracle!\" exclaimed Benedick. \"Our hands are against our hearts!  Come, I will marry you, Beatrice.\"    \"You shall be my husband to save your life,\" was the rejoinder.    Benedick kissed her on the mouth; and the Friar married them after he  had married Claudio and Hero.    \"How is Benedick the married man?\" asked Don Pedro.    \"Too happy to be made unhappy,\" replied Benedick. \"Crack what jokes you  will. As for you, Claudio, I had hoped to run you through the body, but  as you are now my kinsman, live whole and love my cousin.\"    \"My cudgel was in love with you, Benedick, until to-day,\" said Claudio;  but, \"Come, come, let's dance,\" said Benedick.    And dance they did. Not even the news of the capture of Don John was  able to stop the flying feet of the happy lovers, for revenge is not  sweet against an evil man who has failed to do"]]]
