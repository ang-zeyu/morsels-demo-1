He had fallen asleep, with some uneasy feelings arising from  indigestion. They operated in their usual course of visionary terrors.  At length they were all summed up in the apprehension that the phantom  of a dead man held the sleeper by the wrist, and endeavoured to drag him  out of bed. He awaked in horror, and still felt the cold dead grasp of a  corpse's hand on his right wrist. It was a minute before he discovered  that his own left hand was in a state of numbness, and with it he had  accidentally encircled his right arm.    The taste and the smell, like the touch, convey more direct intelligence  than the eye and the ear, and are less likely than those senses to aid  in misleading the imagination. We have seen the palate, in the case of  the porridge-fed lunatic, enter its protest against the acquiescence of  eyes, ears, and touch, in the gay visions which gilded the patient's  confinement. The palate, however, is subject to imposition as well as  the other senses. The best and most acute _bon vivant_ loses his power  of discriminating betwixt different kinds of wine, if he is prevented  from assisting his palate by the aid of his eyes,--that is, if the  glasses of each are administered indiscriminately while he is  blindfolded. Nay, we are authorized to believe that individuals have  died in consequence of having supposed themselves to have taken poison,  when, in reality, the draught they had swallowed as such was of an  innoxious or restorative quality. The delusions of the stomach can  seldom bear upon our present subject, and are not otherwise connected  with supernatural appearances, than as a good dinner and its  accompaniments are essential in fitting out a daring Tam of Shanter, who  is fittest to encounter them when the poet's observation is not unlikely  to apply--    \"Inspiring bauld John Barleycorn,  What dangers thou canst make us scorn!  Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil,  Wi' usquebae we'll face the devil.  The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle,  Fair play, he caredna deils a bodle!\"    Neither has the sense of smell, in its ordinary state, much connexion  with our present subject. Mr. Aubrey tells us, indeed, of an apparition  which disappeared with a curious perfume as well as a most melodious  twang; and popular belief ascribes to the presence of infernal spirits a  strong relish of the sulphureous element of which they are inhabitants.  Such accompaniments, therefore, are usually united with other materials  for imposture. If, as a general opinion assures us, which is not  positively discountenanced by Dr. Hibbert, by the inhalation of certain  gases or poisonous herbs, necromancers can dispose a person to believe  he sees phantoms, it is likely that the nostrils are made to inhale such  suffumigation as well as the mouth.[4]    [Footnote 4: Most ancient authors, who pretend to treat of the wonders  of natural magic, give receipts for calling up phantoms. The lighting  lamps fed by peculiar kinds of medicated oil, and the use of  suffumigations of strong and deleterious herbs, are the means  recommended. From these authorities, perhaps, a professor of legerdemain  assured Dr. Alderson of Hull, that he could compose a preparation of  antimony, sulphur, and other drugs, which, when burnt in a confined  room, would have the effect of causing the patient to suppose he saw  phantoms.--See \"Hibbert on Apparitions,\" p. 120.]    I have now arrived, by a devious path, at the conclusion of this letter,  the object of which is to show from what attributes of our nature,  whether mental or corporeal, arises that predisposition to believe in  supernatural occurrences. It is, I think, conclusive that mankind, from  a very early period, have their minds prepared for such events by the  consciousness of the existence of a spiritual world, inferring in the  general proposition the undeniable truth that each man, from the monarch  to the beggar, who has once acted his part on the stage, continues to  exist, and may again, even in a disembodied state, if such is the  pleasure of Heaven, for aught that we know to the contrary, be permitted  or ordained to mingle amongst those who yet remain in the body. The  abstract possibility of apparitions must be admitted by every one who  believes in a Deity, and His superintending omnipotence. But imagination  is apt to intrude its explanations and inferences founded on inadequate  evidence. Sometimes our violent and inordinate passions, originating in  sorrow for our friends, remorse for our crimes, our eagerness of  patriotism, or our deep sense of devotion--these or other violent  excitements of a moral character, in the visions of night, or the rapt  ecstasy of the day, persuade us that we witness, with our eyes and ears,  an actual instance of that supernatural communication, the possibility  of which cannot be denied. At other times the corporeal organs impose  upon the mind, while the eye and the ear, diseased, deranged, or misled,  convey false impressions to the patient. Very often both the mental  delusion and the physical deception exist at the same time, and men's  belief of the phenomena presented to them, however erroneously, by the  senses, is the firmer and more readily granted, that the physical  impression corresponded with the mental excitement.    So many causes acting thus upon each other in various degrees, or  sometimes separately, it must happen early in the infancy of every  society that there should occur many apparently well-authenticated  instances of supernatural intercourse, satisfactory enough to  authenticate peculiar examples of the general proposition which is  impressed upon us by belief of the immortality of the soul. These  examples of undeniable apparitions (for they are apprehended to be  incontrovertible), fall like the seed of the husbandman into fertile and  prepared soil, and are usually followed by a plentiful crop of  superstitious figments, which derive their sources from circumstances  and enactments in sacred and profane history, hastily adopted, and  perverted from their genuine reading. This shall be the subject of my  next letter.          LETTER II.        Consequences of the Fall on the Communication between Man and the      Spiritual World--Effects of the Flood--Wizards of Pharaoh--Text in      Exodus against Witches--The word _Witch_ is by some said to mean      merely Poisoner--Or if in the Holy Text it also means a Divineress,      she must, at any rate, have been a Character very different to be      identified with it--The original, _Chasaph_, said to mean a person      who dealt in Poisons, often a Traffic of those who dealt with      familiar Spirits--But different from the European Witch of the      Middle Ages--Thus a Witch is not accessary to the Temptation of      Job--The Witch of the Hebrews probably did not rank higher than a      Divining Woman--Yet it was a Crime deserving the Doom of Death,      since it inferred the disowning of Jehovah's Supremacy--Other Texts      of Scripture, in like manner, refer to something corresponding more      with a Fortune-teller or Divining Woman than what is now called a      Witch--Example of the Witch of Endor--Account of her Meeting with      Saul--Supposed by some a mere Impostor--By others, a Sorceress      powerful enough to raise the Spirit of the Prophet by her own      Art--Difficulties attending both Positions--A middle Course adopted,      supposing that, as in the Case of Balak, the Almighty had, by      Exertion of His Will, substituted Samuel, or a good Spirit in his      Character, for the Deception which the Witch intended to      produce--Resumption of the Argument, showing that the Witch of Endor      signified something very different from the modern Ideas of      Witchcraft--The Witches mentioned in the New Testament are not less      different from modern Ideas than those of the Books of Moses, nor do      they appear to have possessed the Power ascribed to      Magicians--Articles of Faith which we may gather from Scripture on      this point--That there might be certain Powers permitted by the      Almighty to Inferior, and even Evil Spirits, is possible; and in      some sense the Gods of the Heathens might be accounted Demons--More      frequently, and in a general sense, they were but logs of wood,      without sense or power of any kind, and their worship founded on      imposture--Opinion that the Oracles were silenced at the Nativity      adopted by Milton--Cases of Demoniacs--The Incarnate Possessions      probably ceased at the same time as the intervention of      Miracles--Opinion of the Catholics--Result, that witchcraft, as the      Word is interpreted in  the Middle Ages, neither occurs under the      Mosaic or Gospel Dispensation--It arose in the Ignorant Period, when      the Christians considered the Gods of the Mahommedan or Heathen      Nations as Fiends, and their Priests as Conjurers or      Wizards--Instance as to the Saracens, and among the Northern      Europeans yet unconverted--The Gods of Mexico and Peru explained on      the same system--Also the Powahs of North America--Opinion of      Mather--Gibb, a supposed Warlock, persecuted by the other      Dissenters--Conclusion.      What degree of communication might have existed between the human race  and the inhabitants of the other world had our first parents kept the  commands of the Creator, can only be subject of unavailing speculation.  We do not, perhaps, presume too much when we suppose, with Milton, that  one necessary consequence of eating the \"fruit of that forbidden tree\"  was removing to a wider distance from celestial essences the beings who,  although originally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#9)"],[1," Bloemfontein Conference had been holding  its useless sessions; the political world seemed so unsettled, and war  appeared so exceedingly likely, that we decided to return to Cape Town,  especially as Mr. Rhodes, who was expected out from England almost  immediately, had cabled asking us to stay at Groot Schuurr, where we  arrived early in July. A few days afterwards I had a ticket given me to  witness the opening of the Legislative Council, or Upper House, by Sir  Alfred Milner. It was an imposing ceremony, and carried out with great  solemnity. The centre of the fine hall was filled with ladies--in fact,  on first arriving, it gave one the idea of a ladies' parliament; but in  a few minutes the members filed in, shortly before the state entry of  His Excellency the Governor. Then, for the first time, I saw the man of  the hour; dignified without being stiff, and looking every inch his  part, he went through his role to perfection. The speech was, as usual,  utterly devoid of interest, and, contrary to the hope of excited  partisans, Transvaal affairs were studiously avoided. A few days later  we went to Government House to be introduced to Sir Alfred; he at once  impressed a stranger as a man of intense strength of mind and purpose,  underlying a somewhat delicate physique, which was at that time,  perhaps, enhanced by a decidedly worn and worried expression of  countenance. Later on I had many conversations with Mr. Rhodes about the  Governor. He used to say--and no one was better qualified to judge--that  Sir Alfred Milner was one of the strongest men he had ever met. \"In the  business I am constantly having to transact with him, connected with the  Chartered Company,\" he remarked, \"I find him, his mind once made up,  unmovable--so much so that we tacitly agree to drop at once any subject  that we do not agree on, for nothing could be gained by discussing it. I  allow he makes his decisions slowly, but once made they are  irrevocable.\"    Mr. Rhodes used also to say he admired beyond words Sir Alfred's  behaviour and the line he adopted in that most difficult crisis before  the war. \"He assumes,\" said his appreciator, \"an attitude of perfect  frankness with all parties; he denies himself to no one who may give him  any information or throw fresh light on the situation; to all he  expresses his views, and repeats his unalterable opinions of what is  required.\"    Other people told me how true these words were, and how ingeniously and  yet ingenuously Sir Alfred Milner contrived to treat a unique position.  Standing alone, the central isolated figure, surrounded by a young and  inexperienced staff, his political advisers men for whom he could have  but little sympathy, and whose opinions he knew to be in reality  diametrically opposed to his and to the present policy at home, the  Governor steered clear of intrigue and personal quarrels by his  intensely straightforward and able conduct. He was in the habit of  almost daily seeing Mr. Rhodes, financiers from Johannesburg, military  men thirsting for war, who were commencing to arrive from England, as  well as his Cabinet Ministers. To these latter he probably volunteered  information about the other interviews he had had, thereby disarming  their criticisms.    From one great man I must pass to another. A few days after our arrival  at Groot Schuurr, Mr. Rhodes and Sir Charles Metcalfe arrived from  England. Incidentally I may mention the former's marvellous reception,  and the fact that nearly five miles of road between Cape Town and Groot  Schuurr were decorated with flags and triumphal arches, while the day  was observed as a general holiday. This had happened to him in a minor  degree so often before that it did not arouse much comment. The same  evening we attended a monster meeting at the Drill Hall, where thousands  of faces were turned simultaneously towards the platform to welcome back  their distinguished citizen. The cheering went on for ten minutes, and  was again and again renewed, till the enthusiasm brought a lump to many  throats, and certainly deeply affected the central figure of the  evening. This meeting, at which no less than a hundred addresses were  presented from every part of Africa--from the far-off Zambesi to the  fruit-growing district of the Paarl, almost entirely populated by  Dutch--even this great demonstration that one great man was capable of  inspiring quickly faded from my memory in view of the insight which  three weeks as his guest gave me of the many sides of his life,  occupations, and character. The extraordinary strength of will and  tenacity of purpose, points always insisted on in connection with him,  seemed on nearer acquaintance to be merely but a small part of a  marvellous whole.    It often used to occur to me, when with Mr. Rhodes, how desirable it  would be to induce our sons and young men in general to imitate some of  the characteristics which were the motive power of his life, and  therefore of his success. I noticed especially the wonderful power of  concentration of thought he possessed, and which he applied to any  subject, no matter how trivial. The variety and scope of his many  projects did not lessen his interest in any one of them. At that time he  was building four railways in Rhodesia, which country was also pinning  its faith to him for its development, its prosperity, and, indeed, its  _modus vivendi_. Apart from this, Cape politics, although he then held  no official position, were occupying a great deal of his time and  thoughts in view of future Federation. It was, therefore, marvellous to  see him putting his whole mind to such matters as his prize poultry and  beasts at the home farm, to the disposing of the same in what he termed  \"my country,\" or to the arranging of his priceless collection of  glass--even to the question of a domicile for the baby lioness lately  presented to him. Again, one moment he might be talking of De Beers  business, involving huge sums of money, the next discussing the progress  of his thirty fruit-farms in the Drakenstein district, where he had no  fewer than 100,000 fruit-trees; another time his horse-breeding  establishment at Kimberley was engaging his attention, or, nearer home,  the road-making and improvements at Groot Schuurr, where he even knew  the wages paid to the 200 Cape boys he was then employing. Mr. Rhodes  was always in favour of doing things on a large scale, made easy,  certainly, by his millionaire's purse. Sometimes a gardener or bailiff  would ask for two or three dozen rose or fruit trees. \"There is no use,\"  he would exclaim impatiently, \"in two dozen of anything. My good man,  you should count in hundreds and thousands, not dozens. That is the only  way to produce any effect or to make any profit.\" Another of his  theories was that people who dwelt in or near towns never had sufficient  fresh air. During one of our morning rides I remember his stopping a  telegraph-boy, and asking him where he lived. When the lad had told him,  he said: \"I suppose there are no windows in your cottage; you had better  go to Rhodesia, where you will find space, and where you won't get  cramped ideas.\" Then he rode on, leaving the boy staring at him with  open eyes. An attractive attribute was his love of his early  associations, his father especially being often the theme of his  conversation. He used freely to express his admiration for the type the  latter represented, now almost extinct, of the old-fashioned country  clergyman-squire. He held with tenacity to the traditions of his  childhood in having always a cold supper on Sunday evenings, instead of  the usual elaborate dinner, also in having the cloth removed for  dessert, to display the mahogany, of which, alas! few of our tables are  now made. With stupidity, or anything thereto approaching, he was apt to  be impatient; neither could he stand young men who affected indifference  to, or boredom with, the events and sights of the day. I often used to  think, however, he frightened people, and that they did not show to  their best advantage, nor was their intelligence at its brightest when  talking with him. I now refer especially to those in his employ.    To his opponents in the political world he was generous when discussing  them in private, however bitter and stinging his remarks were in public.  I remember one evening, on Mr. Merriman's name being mentioned, how Mr.  Rhodes dilated for some time on his charms as a friend and as a  colleague; he told me I should certainly take an opportunity of making  his acquaintance. \"I am so fond of Merriman,\" he added; \"he is one of  the most cultivated of men and the most charming of companions that I  know. We shall come together again some day.\" And this of the man who  was supposed then to hate Cecil John Rhodes with such a deadly hatred  that he, an Englishman born, was said to have been persuaded to Dutch  sympathies by his vindictive feelings against one great  fellow-countryman. Before leaving the subject of Mr. Rhodes, I must note  his intense kindness of heart and genuine hospitality. Groot Schuurr was  a rendezvous for people of all classes, denominations, and politics;  they were all welcome, and they certainly all came. From morn till eve  they passed in and out, very often to proffer a request, or, again,  simply to pay their respects and have the pleasure of a few minutes'  chat. After his morning ride, Mr. Rhodes, if nothing called him to town,  usually walked about his beautiful house, the doors and windows of which  stood open to admit the brilliant sunshine and to enable him to enjoy  glimpses of his beloved Table Mountain, or the brilliant colours of the  salvia and plumbago planted in beds above the stoep. I often call to  mind that tall figure, probably in the same costume in which he had  ridden--white flannel trousers and tweed coat--his hair rather rough,  from a habit he had of passing his hand through it when talking or"]]]
