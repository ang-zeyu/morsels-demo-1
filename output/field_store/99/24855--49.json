[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#9)"],[1," methods are as reasonable as to try to  pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a  non-conducting pipe, which could by the least effort be opened.  Professor Murray made several profound remarks to his white tie and to  the water-carafe upon the table, with a humorous, twinkling aside to  the silver candlestick upon his right.  Then he sat down, and Mr.  Waldron, the famous popular lecturer, rose amid a general murmur of  applause.  He was a stern, gaunt man, with a harsh voice, and an  aggressive manner, but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate  the ideas of other men, and to pass them on in a way which was  intelligible and even interesting to the lay public, with a happy knack  of being funny about the most unlikely objects, so that the precession  of the Equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly  humorous process as treated by him.    It was a bird's-eye view of creation, as interpreted by science, which,  in language always clear and sometimes picturesque, he unfolded before  us.  He told us of the globe, a huge mass of flaming gas, flaring  through the heavens.  Then he pictured the solidification, the cooling,  the wrinkling which formed the mountains, the steam which turned to  water, the slow preparation of the stage upon which was to be played  the inexplicable drama of life.  On the origin of life itself he was  discreetly vague.  That the germs of it could hardly have survived the  original roasting was, he declared, fairly certain.  Therefore it had  come later.  Had it built itself out of the cooling, inorganic elements  of the globe?  Very likely.  Had the germs of it arrived from outside  upon a meteor?  It was hardly conceivable.  On the whole, the wisest  man was the least dogmatic upon the point.  We could not--or at least  we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our  laboratories out of inorganic materials.  The gulf between the dead and  the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge.  But there was a higher and subtler chemistry of Nature, which, working  with great forces over long epochs, might well produce results which  were impossible for us.  There the matter must be left.    This brought the lecturer to the great ladder of animal life, beginning  low down in molluscs and feeble sea creatures, then up rung by rung  through reptiles and fishes, till at last we came to a kangaroo-rat, a  creature which brought forth its young alive, the direct ancestor of  all mammals, and presumably, therefore, of everyone in the audience.  (\"No, no,\" from a sceptical student in the back row.)  If the young  gentleman in the red tie who cried \"No, no,\" and who presumably claimed  to have been hatched out of an egg, would wait upon him after the  lecture, he would be glad to see such a curiosity.  (Laughter.)  It was  strange to think that the climax of all the age-long process of Nature  had been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie.  But had the  process stopped?  Was this gentleman to be taken as the final type--the  be-all and end-all of development?  He hoped that he would not hurt the  feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that,  whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life, still  the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they  were to end entirely in his production.  Evolution was not a spent  force, but one still working, and even greater achievements were in  store.    Having thus, amid a general titter, played very prettily with his  interrupter, the lecturer went back to his picture of the past, the  drying of the seas, the emergence of the sand-bank, the sluggish,  viscous life which lay upon their margins, the overcrowded lagoons, the  tendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the mud-flats, the  abundance of food awaiting them, their consequent enormous growth.  \"Hence, ladies and gentlemen,\" he added, \"that frightful brood of  saurians which still affright our eyes when seen in the Wealden or in  the Solenhofen slates, but which were fortunately extinct long before  the first appearance of mankind upon this planet.\"    \"Question!\" boomed a voice from the platform.    Mr. Waldron was a strict disciplinarian with a gift of acid humor, as  exemplified upon the gentleman with the red tie, which made it perilous  to interrupt him.  But this interjection appeared to him so absurd that  he was at a loss how to deal with it.  So looks the Shakespearean who  is confronted by a rancid Baconian, or the astronomer who is assailed  by a flat-earth fanatic.  He paused for a moment, and then, raising his  voice, repeated slowly the words:  \"Which were extinct before the  coming of man.\"    \"Question!\" boomed the voice once more.    Waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the  platform until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger, who leaned  back in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression, as if he  were smiling in his sleep.    \"I see!\" said Waldron, with a shrug.  \"It is my friend Professor  Challenger,\" and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a  final explanation and no more need be said.    But the incident was far from being closed.  Whatever path the lecturer  took amid the wilds of the past seemed invariably to lead him to some  assertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly brought the  same bulls' bellow from the Professor.  The audience began to  anticipate it and to roar with delight when it came.  The packed  benches of students joined in, and every time Challenger's beard  opened, before any sound could come forth, there was a yell of  \"Question!\" from a hundred voices, and an answering counter cry of  \"Order!\" and \"Shame!\" from as many more.  Waldron, though a hardened  lecturer and a strong man, became rattled.  He hesitated, stammered,  repeated himself, got snarled in a long sentence, and finally turned  furiously upon the cause of his troubles.    \"This is really intolerable!\" he cried, glaring across the platform.  \"I must ask you, Professor Challenger, to cease these ignorant and  unmannerly interruptions.\"    There was a hush over the hall, the students rigid with delight at  seeing the high gods on Olympus quarrelling among themselves.  Challenger levered his bulky figure slowly out of his chair.    \"I must in turn ask you, Mr. Waldron,\" he said, \"to cease to make  assertions which are not in strict accordance with scientific fact.\"    The words unloosed a tempest.  \"Shame!  Shame!\"  \"Give him a hearing!\"  \"Put him out!\"  \"Shove him off the platform!\"  \"Fair play!\" emerged  from a general roar of amusement or execration.  The chairman was on  his feet flapping both his hands and bleating excitedly.  \"Professor  Challenger--personal--views--later,\" were the solid peaks above his  clouds of inaudible mutter.  The interrupter bowed, smiled, stroked his  beard, and relapsed into his chair.  Waldron, very flushed and warlike,  continued his observations.  Now and then, as he made an assertion, he  shot a venomous glance at his opponent, who seemed to be slumbering  deeply, with the same broad, happy smile upon his face.    At last the lecture came to an end--I am inclined to think that it was  a premature one, as the peroration was hurried and disconnected.  The  thread of the argument had been rudely broken, and the audience was  restless and expectant.  Waldron sat down, and, after a chirrup from  the chairman, Professor Challenger rose and advanced to the edge of the  platform.  In the interests of my paper I took down his speech verbatim.    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" he began, amid a sustained interruption from  the back.  \"I beg pardon--Ladies, Gentlemen, and Children--I must  apologize, I had inadvertently omitted a considerable section of this  audience\" (tumult, during which the Professor stood with one hand  raised and his enormous head nodding sympathetically, as if he were  bestowing a pontifical blessing upon the crowd), \"I have been selected  to move a vote of thanks to Mr. Waldron for the very picturesque and  imaginative address to which we have just listened.  There are points  in it with which I disagree, and it has been my duty to indicate them  as they arose, but, none the less, Mr. Waldron has accomplished his  object well, that object being to give a simple and interesting account  of what he conceives to have been the history of our planet.  Popular  lectures are the easiest to listen to, but Mr. Waldron\" (here he beamed  and blinked at the lecturer) \"will excuse me when I say that they are  necessarily both superficial and misleading, since they have to be  graded to the comprehension of an ignorant audience.\"  (Ironical  cheering.)  \"Popular lecturers are in their nature parasitic.\"  (Angry  gesture of protest from Mr. Waldron.)  \"They exploit for fame or cash  the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren.  One smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory, one brick built into  the temple of science, far outweighs any second-hand exposition which  passes an idle hour, but can leave no useful result behind it.  I put  forward this obvious reflection, not out of any desire to disparage Mr.  Waldron in particular, but that you may not lose your sense of  proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest.\" (At this point  Mr. Waldron whispered to the chairman, who half rose and said something  severely to his water-carafe.)  \"But enough of this!\"  (Loud and  prolonged cheers.)  \"Let me pass to some subject of wider interest.  What is the particular point upon which I, as an original investigator,  have challenged our lecturer's accuracy?  It is upon the permanence of  certain types of animal life upon the earth.  I do not speak upon this  subject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I  speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely  to facts, when I say that Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#9)"],[1,"  done this same thing after dismounting, and he now felt confident that  his weapon needed no further examination. He did not put his hand to his  holster. The figure rose from the table, and crossed the room to a set  of shelves in front of which hung a little yellow curtain. Behind it  were cups, cans, bottles, a pistol, counters, red, white, and blue, and  two fresh packs of cards, blue and pink, side by side. Seeing these,  Toussaint drew a handkerchief from his pocket, and unwrapped two further  packs, both blue; and at this Cutler's intent face grew into plain shape  close to the window, but receded again into uncertain dimness. From down  in the gulch came shouts that the runaway horse was captured. Toussaint  listened, ran to the door, and quickly returning, put the blue pack  from the shelf into his pocket, leaving in exchange one of his own. He  hesitated about altering the position of the cards on the shelf, but  Kelley and Loomis were unobservant young men, and the half-breed placed  the pink cards on top of his blue ones. The little yellow curtain again  hung innocently over the shelves, and Toussaint, pouring himself a drink  of whiskey, faced round, and for the first time saw the window that had  been behind his back. He was at it in an instant, wrenching its rusty  pin, that did not give, but stuck motionless in the wood. Cursing,  he turned and hurried out of the door and round the cabin. No one was  there. Some hundred yards away the noiseless Cutler crawled farther  among the thickets that filled the head of the gulch. Toussaint whipped  out a match, and had it against his trousers to strike and look if there  were footprints, when second thoughts warned him this might be seen, and  was not worth risking suspicion over, since so many feet came and went  by this cabin. He told himself no one could have been there to see him,  and slowly returned inside, with a mind that fell a hair's breadth short  of conviction.    The boys, coming up with the horse, met Cutler, who listened to how  Duster had stood still as soon as he had kicked free of his saddle,  making no objection to being caught. They suggested that he would not  have broken loose had he been tied with a rope; and hearing this, Cutler  bit off a piece of tobacco, and told them they were quite right: a  horse should never be tied by his bridle. For a savory moment the scout  cuddled his secret, and turned it over like the tobacco lump under his  tongue. Then he explained, and received serenely the amazement of Loomis  and Kelley.    \"When you kids have travelled this Western country awhile you'll keep  your cards locked,\" said he. \"He's going to let us win first. You'll  see, he'll play a poor game with the pink deck. Then, if we don't call  for fresh cards, why, he'll call for 'em himself. But, just for the fun  of the thing, if any of us loses steady, why, we'll call. Then, when he  gets hold of his strippers, watch out. When he makes his big play, and  is stretchin' for to rake the counters in, you grab 'em, Joole; for by  then I'll have my gun on him, and if he makes any trouble we'll feed him  to the coyotes. I expect that must have been it, boys,\" he continued, in  a new tone, as they came within possible ear-shot of the half-breed in  the cabin. \"A coyote come around him where he was tied. The fool horse  has seen enough of 'em to git used to 'em, you'd think, but he don't.  There; that'll hold him. I guess he'll have to pull the world along with  him if he starts to run again.\"    The lamp was placed on the window-shelf, and the four took seats, Cutler  to the left of Toussaint, with Kelley opposite. The pink cards fell  harmless, and for a while the game was a dull one to see. Holding a pair  of kings, Cutler won a little from Toussaint, who remarked that luck  must go with the money of Uncle Sam. After a few hands, the half-breed  began to bet with ostentatious folly, and, losing to one man and  another, was joked upon the falling off of his game. In an hour's time  his blue chips had been twice reinforced, and twice melted from the neat  often-counted pile in which he arranged them; moreover, he had lost a  horse from his string down on Chug Water.    \"Lend me ten dollar,\" he said to Cutler. \"You rich man now.\"    In the next few deals Kelley became poor. \"I'm sick of this luck,\" said  he.    \"Then change it, why don't you? Let's have a new deck.\" And Loomis rose.    \"Joole, you always are for something new,\" said Cutler. \"Now I'm doing  pretty well with these pink cards. But I'm no hog. Fetch on your fresh  ones.\"    The eyes of the half-breed swerved to the yellow curtain. He was by  a French trapper from Canada out of a Sioux squaw, one of Red Cloud's  sisters, and his heart beat hot with the evil of two races, and none of  their good. He was at this moment irrationally angry with the men who  had won from him through his own devices, and malice undisguised shone  in his lean flat face. At sight of the blue cards falling in the first  deal, silence came over the company, and from the distant parade-ground  the bugle sounded the melancholy strain of taps. Faint, far, solemn,  melodious, the music travelled unhindered across the empty night.    \"Them men are being checked off in their bunks now,\" said Cutler.    \"What you bet this game?\" demanded Toussaint.    \"I've heard 'em play that same music over a soldier's grave,\" said  Kelley.    \"You goin' to bet?\" Toussaint repeated.    Cutler pushed forward the two necessary white chips. No one's hand was  high, and Loomis made a slight winning. The deal went its round several  times, and once, when it was Toussaint's, Cutler suspected that special  cards had been thrown to him by the half-breed as an experiment. He  therefore played the gull to a nicety, betting gently upon his three  kings; but when he stepped out boldly and bet the limit, it was not  Toussaint but Kelley who held the higher hand, winning with three aces.  Why the coup should be held off longer puzzled the scout, unless it was  that Toussaint was carefully testing the edges of his marked cards to  see if he controlled them to a certainty. So Cutler played on calmly.  Presently two aces came to him in Toussaint's deal, and he wondered how  many more would be in his three-card draw. Very pretty! One only, and he  lost to Loomis, who had drawn three, and held four kings. The hands  were getting higher, they said. The game had \"something to it now.\" But  Toussaint grumbled, for his luck was bad all this year, he said. Cutler  had now made sure that the aces and kings went where the half-breed  wished, and could be slid undetected from the top or the middle or the  bottom of the pack; but he had no test yet how far down the scale the  marking went. At Toussaint's next deal Cutler judged the time had come,  and at the second round of betting he knew it. The three white men  played their parts, raising each other without pause, and again there  was total silence in the cabin. Every face bent to the table, watching  the turn repeat its circle with obstinate increase, until new chips and  more new chips had been brought to keep on with, and the heap in the  middle had mounted high in the hundreds, while in front of Toussaint  lay his knife and a match-box--pledges of two more horses which he had  staked. He had drawn three cards, while the others took two, except  Cutler, who had a pair of kings again, and drawing three, picked up two  more. Kelley dropped out, remarking he had bet more than his hand was  worth, which was true, and Loomis followed him. Their persistence had  surprised Toussaint a little. He had not given every one suspicious  hands: Cutler's four kings were enough. He bet once more, was raised by  the scout, called, and threw down his four aces.    \"That beats me,\" said Cutler, quietly, and his hand moved under his  frock-coat, as the half-breed, eyeing the central pile of counters in  triumph, closed his fingers over it. They were dashed off by Kelley, who  looked expectantly across at Cutler, and seeing the scout's face wither  into sudden old age, cried out, \"For God's sake, Jarvis, where's your  gun?\" Kelley sprang for the yellow curtain, and reeled backward at the  shot of Toussaint. His arm thrashed along the window-sill as he fell,  sweeping over the lamp, and flaring channels of oil ran over his body  and spread on the ground. But these could no longer hurt him. The  half-breed had leaped outside the cabin, enraged that Cutler should have  got out during the moment he had been dealing with Kelley. The scout was  groping for his ivory-handled pistol off in the darkness. He found  it, and hurried to the little window at a second shot he heard inside.  Loomis, beating the rising flame away, had seized the pistol from the  shelf, and aimlessly fired into the night at Toussaint. He fired again,  running to the door from the scorching heat. Cutler got round the house  to save him if he could, and saw the half-breed's weapon flash, and the  body pitch out across the threshold. Toussaint, gaining his horse, shot  three times and missed Cutler, whom he could not clearly see; and he  heard the scout's bullets sing past him as his horse bore him rushing  away.      II    Jarvis Cutler lifted the dead Loomis out of the cabin. He made a try  for Kelley's body, but the room had become a cave of flame, and he was  driven from the door. He wrung his hands, giving himself bitter blame  aloud, as he covered Loomis with his saddle-blanket, and jumped bareback  upon Duster to go to the post. He had not been riding a minute when  several men met him. They had seen the fire from below, and on their way  up the half-breed had passed them at a run.    \"Here's our point,\" said Cutler. \"Will he hide with the Sioux, or  will he take to the railroad? Well, that's my business more than being  wagon-master. I'll get a warrant. You tell Lieutenant Balwin--and  somebody give me a fresh horse.\"    A short while later, as"]]]
