Eul., \"Mem. Sanct.,\"      Pref., sec. 5, \"Irrefragibilis manet sententia, animadverti      debere in eos qui talia de ipso non vcrentur profiteri.\" On      hearing of Isaac's death the king published a reminder on this      law.        [4] See p. 91.        [5] Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 3, calls it a timid answer.        [6] Matt. xxiv. 24.        [7] \"Accensum ultionis furorem in corde ad perniciem eius      reponunt.\" Eulogius, 1.1.    If this was so, the opportunity soon presented itself, and Perfectus,  being abroad on an errand similar to the previous one, was met[1] by his  former interrogators, who, on the charge of reviling Mohammed, and doing  despite to their religion, dragged him before the Kadi. Being  questioned, his courage at first failed him, and he withdrew his words.  He was then imprisoned to await further examination at the end of the  month, which happened to be the Ramadhan or fast month. In prison the  priest repented his weakness, and when brought again before the judge on  the Mohammedan Easter, he recanted his recantation, adding, \"I have  cursed and do curse your prophet, a messenger not of God, but of Satan,  a dealer in witchcraft, an adulterer, and a liar.\" He was immediately  led off for execution, but before his death prophesied that of the  King's minister, Nazar, within a year of his own. He was beheaded on  April 18, 850.[2] The apologists, on insufficient evidence, describe the  death of two Moslems, who were drowned the same day in the river, as a  manifest judgement of Heaven for the murder of Perfectus.[3]        [1] \"Dolo circumventum,\" says Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 4.        [2] Johannes Vasaeus places this persecution (by a manifest      error) in 950, under Abdurrahman III., stating at the same time      that some writers placed it in 850, but, as it appeared to him,      wrongly: \"Abdurrahman Halihatan rex Cordobae movit duodecimam      persecutionem in Christianos.\"        [3] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.\" ii., ch. i. sec. 5.    The example set by Perfectus did not bear fruit at once, but no doubt  the evidence which it gave of the ease and comparative painlessness,  with which a martyr's crown could be obtained, was not lost upon the  brooding and zealous spirits living in solitary retreats and trying by a  life of religious devotion to cut themselves off from the seductive  pleasures of an active life.    The next victim, a little more than a year later, was a petty tradesman,  named John,[1] who does not seem to have courted his own fate. He had  aroused the animosity of his Moslem rivals by a habit which he had  contracted of pronouncing the name of the Prophet in his market  transactions, taking his name, as they thought, in vain, and with a view  to attracting buyers.[2] John, being taxed with this, with ill-timed  pleasantry retorted, \"Cursed be he who wishes to name your Prophet.\" He  was haled before the Kadi, and, after receiving 400 stripes,[3] was  thrown into prison. Subsequently he was taken thence and driven through  the city riding backwards on an ass, while a crier was sent before him  through the Christian quarters, proclaiming: \"Such shall be the  punishment of those, that speak evil of the Prophet of God.\"        [1] Eugolius, \"Mem. Sanct.\" i. sec. 9; and Alvar, Ind. Lum.      sec. 5.        [2] So Eulogius, 1. 1., and Dozy, ii., 129. Alvar's account (1.      1.) is not very intelligible: \"Parvipendens nostrum prophetam,      semper eius nomen in derisione frequentas, et mendacium tuum      per iuramenta nostrae religionis, ut tibi videtur, falsa      auribus te ignorantium Christianum esse semper confirmas.\"        [3] Or, according to Eulogius, 500.    So far we have had cases, where the charge of persecution, brought by  the apologists of the martyrs against the Moslems, can be more or less  sustained, but the next instance is of a different character. Isaac,[1]  a monk of Tabanos, and descended from noble and wealthy ancestors, was  born in 824, and by his knowledge of Arabic, attained in early life to  the position of an exceptor, or scribe,[2] but gave up his appointment  at the age of twenty, in order to enter the monastery of Tabanos, which  his uncle and aunt, Jeremiah and Elizabeth, had founded near Cordova.        [1] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. ch. ii. sec. 1, also Pref.,      secs. 2 ff. After his death Isaac was credited with having      performed miracles from his earliest years. He was said to have      spoken three times in his mother's womb (cp. a similar fable      about Jesus in the Koran, c. iii. verse 40), and when a child,      to have embraced, unhurt, a globe of fire from Heaven.        [2] Not, as Florez, a tax-gatherer.    Roused by the tale of Perfectus' death and John's sufferings, he  voluntarily went before the Kadi, and, pretending to be an \"enquirer,\"  begged him to expound to him the doctrines of Islam. The Kadi,  congratulating himself on the prospect of such a promising convert,  gravely complied; when Isaac, answering him in fluent Arabic, said: \"He  has lied unto you--may the curse of Heaven consume him!--who full of all  wickedness has led astray so many men, and doomed them with himself to  the lowest deep of hell. Filled with Satan, and practising Satanic arts,  he hath given his followers a drink of deadly wine, and will without  doubt expiate his guilt with everlasting damnation.\" Hearing these, and  other like _chaste_[1] utterances, the judge listened in a sort of  stupor of rage and astonishment, feelings which even found vent in  tears; till, his indignation passing all control, he struck the monk in  the face, who then said, \"Dost thou strike that which is made in the  image of God?\"[2] The assessors of the Kadi also reproached him for  striking a prisoner, their law being that one who is worthy of death  should not suffer other indignities. The Kadi, having now recovered his  self-command, gave his decision, that Isaac, whether drunk or mad, had  committed a crime which, by an express law of Mohammed's, merited  condign punishment. He was accordingly beheaded, and, his body being  burnt, his ashes were cast into the river (June 3, 851). This was done  to prevent the Christians from carrying off his body, and preserving it  for the purpose of working miracles.[3]    Isaac's conduct and fate, Eulogius tells us, electrified the people, who  were amazed at the _newness_ of the thing.[4] It was at this point that  Eulogius himself began to shew his sympathy with these fanatical doings  by encouraging and helping others to follow Isaac's example.        [1] Eulogius, \"Mem. Sanct.,\" Pref., sec. 5, \"_Ore pudico_      summisque reverentiae ausibus viribusque.\"        [2] Cp. Acts xxiii. 3.        [3] Eulog., \"Lib. Apolog.,\" sec. 35, mentions a proposed edict      of the authorities, visiting the seeker of relics with severer      penalties.        [4] See Eulog., Letter to Alvar, apud Florez., xi. 290.    The number of misguided men and women that now came forward and threw  their lives away is certainly remarkable, and seems to have struck the  Moslems as perfectly unaccountable. The Arabs themselves were as brave  men as the world has ever seen, and, by the very ordinances of their  faith, were bound to adventure their lives for their religion in actual  human conflict with infidel foes, yet they were unable to conceive how  any man in his senses could willingly deprive himself of life in such a  way as could do no service to the cause, religious or other, which he  had at heart. They were quite unable to appreciate that intense  antagonism towards the world and its perilous environment, which  Christianity teaches; that spirit of renouncement of the vanities, nay,  even of the duties of life, which prompted men and women to immure  themselves in cloisters and retreats, far from all spheres of human  usefulness. Life under these circumstances had naturally little to make  it worth the living, and became all the more easy to relinquish, when  death, in itself a thing to be desired, was further invested with the  glories of martyrdom.    The example of Isaac was therefore followed within two days by a monk  named Sanctius[1] or Sancho, who was executed on June 5th. Three days  later were beheaded Peter, a priest of Ecija; Walabonsus, a deacon of  Ilipa; Sabinianus and Wistremundus, monks of St Zoilus; Habentius, a  monk of St Christopher's Church at Cordova; while Jeremiah,[2] uncle of  Isaac, was scourged to death. Their bodies were burned, and the ashes  cast into the river.    Sisenandus of Badajos[3] found a similar fate on July 16th: four days  subsequently Paul, a deacon of St Zoilus, gave himself up; and the same  number of days later, Theodomir, a monk of Carmona: all of whom were  beheaded.        [1] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. 3.        [2] _Ibid._, c. iv.        [3] After his martyrdom he procured the release from prison of      Tiberias, priest of Beja! Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. vi.          CHAPTER IV.    FANATICISM OF THE MARTYRS.      The next candidates for martyrdom were two young and beautiful girls,  whose history we learn from their patron, Eulogius, who seems to have  regarded one of these maidens, Flora, with a Platonic love mingled with  a sort of religious devotion.    Flora,[1] the daughter of a Moslem father and a Christian mother, was  born at Cordova. She is said to have practised abstinence even in her  cradle. At first she was brought up as a Moslem, and lived in conformity  with that faith, until, being converted to Christianity about eight  years before this time, and finding the intolerance of her father and  her brother unbearable, she deserted her home. But when her brother, in  his efforts to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#9)"],[1," every night for about three months she was cautiously \"kept  locked up in the garret,\" until, as they supposed, she was fully \"cured  of the desire to do so again.\" But she was incurable. She had been a  witness to the fact that her own father's brains had been blown out by  the discharge of a heavily loaded gun, deliberately aimed at his head by  his drunken master. She only needed half a chance to make still greater  struggles than ever for freedom.    She had great faith in God, and found much solace in singing some of the  good old Methodist tunes, by day and night. Her owner, observing this  apparently tranquil state of mind, indicating that she \"seemed better  contented than ever,\" concluded that it was safe to let the garret door  remain unlocked at night. Not many weeks were allowed to pass before she  resolved to again make a bold strike for freedom. This time she had to  leave the two little boys, Levin and Peter, behind.    On the night she started she went to the bed where they were sleeping,  kissed them, and, consigning them into the hands of God, bade her mother  good-bye, and with her two little girls wended her way again to  Burlington County, New Jersey, but to a different neighborhood from that  where she had been seized. She changed her name to Charity, and  succeeded in again joining her husband, but, alas, with the  heart-breaking thought that she had been compelled to leave her two  little boys in slavery and one of the little girls on the road for the  father to go back after. Thus she began life in freedom anew.    Levin and Peter, eight and six years of age respectively, were now left  at the mercy of the enraged owner, and were soon hurried off to a  Southern market and sold, while their mother, for whom they were daily  weeping, was they knew not where. They were too young to know that they  were slaves, or to understand the nature of the afflicting separation.  Sixteen years before Peter's return, his older brother (Levin) died a  slave in the State of Alabama, and was buried by his surviving brother,  Peter.    No idea other than that they had been \"kidnapped\" from their mother ever  entered their minds; nor had they any knowledge of the State from whence  they supposed they had been taken, the last names of their mother and  father, or where they were born. On the other hand, the mother was aware  that the safety of herself and her rescued children depended on keeping  the whole transaction a strict family secret. During the forty years of  separation, except two or three Quaker friends, including the devoted  friend of the slave, Benjamin Lundy, it is doubtful whether any other  individuals were let into the secret of her slave life. And when the  account given of Peter's return, etc., was published in 1850, it led  some of the family to apprehend serious danger from the partial  revelation of the early condition of the mother, especially as it was  about the time that the Fugitive Slave law was passed.    Hence, the author of \"The Kidnapped and the Ransomed\" was compelled to  omit these dangerous facts, and had to confine herself strictly to the  \"personal recollections of Peter Still\" with regard to his being  \"kidnapped.\" Likewise, in the sketch of Seth Concklin's eventful life,  written by Dr. W.H. Furness, for similar reasons he felt obliged to make  but bare reference to his wonderful agency in relation to Peter's  family, although he was fully aware of all the facts in the case.        UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS.      Here are introduced a few out of a very large number of interesting  letters, designed for other parts of the book as occasion may require.  All letters will be given precisely as they were written by their  respective authors, so that there may be no apparent room for charging  the writer with partial colorings in any instance. Indeed, the  originals, however ungrammatically written or erroneously spelt, in  their native simplicity possess such beauty and force as corrections and  additions could not possibly enhance--        LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).      WILMINGTON, 3mo. 23d, 1856.    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Since I wrote thee this morning informing  thee of the safe arrival of the Eight from Norfolk, Harry Craige has  informed me, that he has a man from Delaware that he proposes to take  along, who arrived since noon. He will take the man, woman and two  children from here with him, and the four men will get in at Marcus  Hook. Thee may take Harry Craige by the hand as a brother, true to the  cause; he is one of our most efficient aids on the Rail Road, and worthy  of full confidence. May they all be favored to get on safe. The woman  and three children are no common stock. I assure thee finer specimens of  humanity are seldom met with. I hope herself and children may be enabled  to find her husband, who has been absent some years, and the rest of  their days be happy together.    I am, as ever, thy friend,    THOS. GARRETT.        LETTER FROM MISS G.A. LEWIS (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).      KIMBERTON, October 28th, 1855.    ESTEEMED FRIEND;--This evening a company of eleven friends reached here,  having left their homes on the night of the 26th inst. They came into  Wilmington, about ten o'clock on the morning of the 27th, and left  there, in the town, their two carriages, drawn by two horses. They went  to Thomas Garrett's by open day-light and from thence were sent hastily  onward for fear of pursuit. They reached Longwood meeting-house in the  evening, at which place a Fair Circle had convened, and stayed a while  in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one of the Kennet  friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning, and from  thence, by daylight, to within a short distance of this place.    They come from New Chestertown, within five miles of the place from  which the nine lately forwarded came, and left behind them a colored  woman who knew of their intended flight and of their intention of  passing through Wilmington and leaving their horses and carriages there.    I have been thus particular in my statement, because the case seems to  us one of unusual danger. We have separated the company for the present,  sending a mother and five children, two of them quite small, in one  direction, and a husband and wife and three lads in another, until I  could write to you and get advice if you have any to give, as to the  best method of forwarding them, and assistance pecuniarily, in getting  them to Canada. The mother and children we have sent off of the usual  route, and to a place where I do not think they can remain many days.    We shall await hearing from you. H. Kimber will be in the city on third  day, the 30th, and any thing left at 408 Green Street directed to his  care, will meet with prompt attention.    Please give me again the direction of Hiram Wilson and the friend in  Elmira, Mr. Jones, I think. If you have heard from any of the nine since  their safe arrival, please let us know when you write.    Very Respectfully,    G.A. LEWIS.    _2d day morning, 29th_.--The person who took the husband and wife and  three lads to E.F. Pennypecker, and Peart, has returned and reports that  L. Peart sent three on to Norristown. We fear that there they will fall  into the hands of an ignorant colored man Daniel Ross, and that he may  not understand the necessity of caution. Will you please write to some  careful person there? The woman and children detained in this  neighborhood are a very helpless set. Our plan was to assist them as  much as possible, and when we get things into the proper train for  sending them on, to get the assistance of the husband and wife, who have  no children, but are uncle and aunt to the woman with five, in taking  with them one of the younger children, leaving fewer for the mother. Of  the lads, or young men, there is also one whom we thought capable of  accompanying one of the older girls--one to whom he is paying attention,  they told us. Would it not be the best way to get those in Norristown  under your own care? It seems to me their being sent on could then be  better arranged. This, however, is only a suggestion,    Hastily yours,    G.A. LEWIS.        LETTER FROM E.L. STEVENS, ESQ. _(The reader will interpret for  himself_.)      WASHINGTON, D.C., July 11th, 1858.    MY DEAR SIR:--Susan Bell left here yesterday with the child of her  relative, and since leaving I have thought, perhaps, you had not the  address of the gentleman in Syracuse where the child is to be taken for  medical treatment, etc. His name is Dr. H.B. Wilbur. A woman living with  him is a most excellent nurse and will take a deep interest in the  child, which, no doubt, will under Providence be the means of its  complete restoration to health. Be kind enough to inform me whether  Susan is with you, and if she is give her the proper direction. _Ten  packages_ were sent to your address last evening, one of them belongs to  Susan, and she had better remain with you till she gets it, as it may  not have come to hand. Susan thought she would go to Harrisburg when she  left here and stay over Sunday, if so, she would not get to Philadelphia  till Monday or Tuesday. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and  inform me of her arrival, also when the packages came safe to hand,  inform me especially if Susan's came safely.    Truly Yours,    E.L. STEVENS.        LETTER FROM S.H. GAY, ESQ., EX-EDITOR OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD AND  NEW YORK TRIBUNE.      FRIEND STILL:--The two women, Laura and Lizzy, arrived this morning. I  shall forward them to Syracuse this afternoon.    The two men came safely yesterday, but went to Gibbs'. He has friends on  board the boat who are on the lookout for fugitives, and send them, when  found, to his house. Those whom you wish to be particularly under my  charge, must have careful directions to this office.    There is now no other sure place, but the office, or Gibbs', that I "]]]
