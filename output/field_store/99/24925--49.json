The  experiments show that periods of darkness are not necessary to the  growth and development of plants. There is every reason, therefore, to  suppose that the electric light can be profitably used in the growing  of plants. It is only necessary to overcome the difficulties, the  chief of which are the injurious influences upon plants near the  light, the too rapid hastening to maturity in some species, and in  short the whole series of practical adjustments of conditions to  individual circumstances. Thus far, to be sure, we have learned more  of the injurious effects than of the beneficial ones, but this only  means that we are acquiring definite facts concerning the whole  influence of electric light upon vegetation; and in some cases,  notably in our lettuce tests, the light has already been found to be a  useful adjunct to forcing establishments.... It is highly probable  that there are certain times in the life of the plant when the  electric light will prove to be particularly helpful. Many experiments  show that injury follows its use at that critical time when the  planetlet is losing its support from the seed and is beginning to  shift for itself, and other experiments show that good results follow  from its later use.... On the whole, I am inclined toward Siemens'  view that there is a future for electro-horticulture.\"    JOSEPH P. JAMES.  Washington, Jan. 20, 1892.           *       *       *       *       *          ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE. By CLARENCE D. WARNER.      It is well known that currents of electricity exist in the atmosphere.  Clouds are charged and discharged. There is a constant change of  electricity from earth to air and from air to earth, the latter being  the great reservoir for all electricity. Hills, mountain peaks, trees,  high chimneys, spires, in fact all points elevated above the earth's  surface assist greatly in charging and discharging the atmosphere.  Again, if two iron rods are driven into the earth and connected by a  copper wire with an electrometer in the circuit, the instrument is  almost immediately affected, showing that currents of electricity are  running through the ground. Now, what is the function of these  atmospheric and ground electric currents? Many scientists are agreed  that certain forms of precipitation are due to electrical action; but  my observations have led me to believe conclusively that electricity  is a potent factor in the economy of nature, and has more to do with  the growth and development of plants than has hitherto been known.  Davy succeeded in the decomposition of the alkalies, potash and soda,  by means of electric currents. In our laboratories, water and ternary  compounds are rapidly decomposed by the battery, and we may reasonably  suppose that that which is effected in our laboratories by artificial  means takes place in the great laboratory of nature on a grander and  more extended scale.    Plant food is carried throughout the plant by means of the flow of  sap; these currents circulate through all the rootlets and center, as  it were, in the stalk, carrying their tiny burdens of various elements  and depositing them in their proper places. That this phenomenon of  circulation is due to electricity cannot be doubted. Most plants grow  more rapidly during the night than in the day. May not the following  be a reason for this?    We have already mentioned how electric currents pass from air to earth  and _vice versa_; at night the plant is generally covered with dew and  the plant itself becomes a good conductor, and, consequently, currents  of electricity pass to each through this medium, and during the  passage convert soil elements into plant food and stimulate the upward  currents to gather up the dissolved elements and carry them to their  proper places.    From the time electricity became a science, much research has been  made to determine its effect, if any, upon plant growth. The earlier  investigations gave in many cases contradictory results. Whether this  was due to a lack of knowledge of the science on the part of the one  performing the experiments, or some defect in the technical  applications, we are not prepared to say; but this we do know, that  such men as Jolabert, Nollet, Mainbray and other eminent physicists  affirmed that electricity favored the germination of seeds and  accelerated the growth of plants; while, on the other hand,  Ingenhouse, Sylvestre and other savants denied the existence of this  electric influence. The heated controversies and animated discussions  attending the opposing theories stimulated more careful and thorough  investigations, which establish beyond a doubt that electricity has a  beneficial effect on vegetation. Sir Humphry Davy, Humboldt, Wollaston  and Becquerel occupied themselves with the theoretical side of the  question; but it was not till after 1845 that practical electroculture  was undertaken. Williamson suggested the use of gigantic electrostatic  machines, but the attempts were fruitless. The methods most generally  adopted in experiments consisted of two metallic plates--one of copper  and one of zinc--placed in the soil and connected by a wire. Sheppard  employed the method in England in 1846 and Forster used the same in  Scotland. In the year 1847 Hubeck in Germany surrounded a field with a  network of wires. Sheppard's experiments showed that electricity  increased the return from root crops, while grass perished near the  electrodes, and plants developed without the use of electricity were  inferior to those grown under its influence. Hubeck came to the  conclusion that seeds germinated more rapidly and buckwheat gave  larger returns; in all other cases the electric current produced no  result. Professor Fife in England and Otto von Ende in Germany carried  on experiments at the same time, but with negative results, and these  scientists advised the complete abandonment of applying electricity to  agriculture. After some years had elapsed Fichtner began a series of  experiments in the same direction. He employed a battery, the two  wires of which were placed in the soil parallel to each other. Between  the wires were planted peas, grass and barley, and in every case the  crop showed an increase of from thirteen to twenty-seven per cent.  when compared with ordinary methods of cultivation.    Fischer, of Waldheim, believing atmospheric electricity to aid much in  the growth and development of plants, made the following tests:    He placed metallic supports to the number of about sixty around each  hectare (2.47 acres) of loam; these supports were provided at their  summits with electrical accumulators in the form of crowns surmounted  with teeth. These collectors were united by metallic connection. The  result of this culture applied to cereals was to increase the crop by  half.    The following experiment was also tried: Metallic plates sixty-five  centimeters by forty centimeters were placed in the soil. These plates  were alternately of zinc and copper and placed about thirty meters  apart, connected two and two, by a wire. The result was to increase  from twofold to fourfold the production of certain garden plants. Mr.  Fischer says that it is evidently proved that electricity aids in the  more complete breaking up of the soil constituents. Finally he says  that plants thus treated mature more quickly, are almost always  perfectly healthy, and are not affected with fungoid growth.    Later, N. Specnew, inspired by the results arrived at by his  predecessors, was led to investigate the influence of electricity on  plants in every stage of their development; the results of his  experiments were most satisfactory and of practical interest. He began  by submitting different seeds to the action of an electric current,  and found that their development was rendered more rapid and complete.  He experimented with the seeds of haricot beans, sunflowers, winter  and spring rye. Two lots, of twelve groups of one hundred and twenty  seeds each, were plunged into water until they swelled, and while wet  the seeds were introduced into long glass cylinders, open at both  ends. Copper disks were pressed against the seeds, the disks were  connected with the poles of an induction coil, the current was kept on  for one or two minutes and immediately afterward the seeds were sown.  The temperature was kept from 45 deg. to 50 deg. Fahrenheit, and the  experiments repeated four times. The following table shows the  results:                                       Peas.  Beans.  Barley.  Sunflowers.                                     Days.   Days.    Days.      Days.

The  current did not affect the yield.    At the Botanical Gardens at Kew, the following experiment was tried:    Large plates of zinc and copper (0.445 meter and 0.712 meter) were  placed in the soil and connected by wires, so arranged that the  current passed through the ground; the arrangement was really a  battery of (zinc | earth | copper). This method was applied to pot  herbs and flowering plants and also to the growing of garden produce;  in the latter case the result was a large crop and the vegetables  grown were of enormous size.    Extensive experiments in electroculture were also made at Pskov,  Russia. Plots of earth were sown to rye, corn, oats, barley, peas,  clover and flax; around these respective plots were placed insulating  rods, on the top of which were crown-shaped collectors--the latter  connected by means of wires.

In  particular, the definitions are still adhered to which were adopted as  the result of the researches of M. Violle on the radiation of fused  platinum at the temperature of solidification; and most physicists  utilize in the ordinary methods of photometry the clearly defined  notions of M. Blondel as to the luminous intensity of flux,  illumination (_eclairement_), light (_eclat_), and lighting  (_eclairage_), with the corresponding units, decimal candle, _lumen_,  _lux_, carcel lamp, candle per square centimetre, and _lumen_-hour.[4]    [Footnote 4: These are the magnitudes and units adopted at the  International Congress of Electricians in 1904.

MEASURE OF CERTAIN PHYSICAL CONSTANTS    The progress of metrology has led, as a consequence, to corresponding  progress in nearly all physical measurements, and particularly in the  measure of natural constants. Among these, the constant of gravitation  occupies a position quite apart from the importance and simplicity of  the physical law which defines it, as well as by its generality. Two  material particles are mutually attracted to each other by a force  directly proportional to the product of their mass, and inversely  proportional to the square of the distance between them. The  coefficient of proportion is determined when once the units are  chosen, and as soon as we know the numerical values of this force, of  the two masses, and of their distance. But when we wish to make  laboratory experiments serious difficulties appear, owing to the  weakness of the attraction between masses of ordinary dimensions.  Microscopic forces, so to speak, have to be observed, and therefore  all the causes of errors have to be avoided which would be unimportant  in most other physical researches. It is known that Cavendish was the  first who succeeded by means of the torsion balance in effecting  fairly precise measurements. This method has been again taken in hand  by different experimenters, and the most recent results are due to Mr  Vernon Boys. This learned physicist is also the author of a most  useful practical invention, and has succeeded in making quartz threads  as fine as can be desired and extremely uniform. He finds that these  threads possess valuable properties, such as perfect elasticity and  great tenacity. He has been able, with threads not more than 1/500 of  a millimetre in diameter, to measure with precision couples of an  order formerly considered outside the range of experiment, and to  reduce the dimensions of the apparatus of Cavendish in the proportion  of 150 to 1. The great advantage found in the use of these small  instruments is the better avoidance of the perturbations arising from  draughts of air, and of the very serious influence of the slightest  inequality in temperature.    Other methods have been employed in late years by other experimenters,  such as the method of Baron Eoetvoes, founded on the use of a torsion  lever, the method of the ordinary balance, used especially by  Professors Richarz and Krigar-Menzel and also by Professor Poynting,  and the method of M. Wilsing, who uses a balance with a vertical beam.  The results fairly agree, and lead to attributing to the earth a  density equal to 5.527.    The most familiar manifestation of gravitation is gravity. The action  of the earth on the unit of mass placed in one point, and the  intensity of gravity, is measured, as we know, by the aid of a  pendulum. The methods of measurement, whether by absolute or by  relative determinations, so greatly improved by Borda and Bessel, have  been still further improved by various geodesians, among whom should  be mentioned M. von Sterneek and General Defforges. Numerous  observations have been made in all parts of the world by various  explorers, and have led to a fairly complete knowledge of the  distribution of gravity over the surface of the globe. Thus we have  succeeded in making evident anomalies which would not easily find  their place in the formula of Clairaut.    Another constant, the determination of which is of the greatest  utility in astronomy of position, and the value of which enters into  electromagnetic theory, has to-day assumed, with the new ideas on the  constitution of matter, a still more considerable importance. I refer  to the speed of light, which appears to us, as we shall see further  on, the maximum value of speed which can be given to a material body.    After the historical experiments of Fizeau and Foucault, taken up  afresh, as we know, partly by Cornu, and partly by Michelson and  Newcomb, it remained still possible to increase the precision of the  measurements. Professor Michelson has undertaken some new researches  by a method which is a combination of the principle of the toothed  wheel of Fizeau with the revolving mirror of Foucault. The toothed  wheel is here replaced, however, by a grating, in which the lines and  the spaces between them take the place of the teeth and the gaps, the  reflected light only being returned when it strikes on the space  between two lines. The illustrious American physicist estimates that  he can thus evaluate to nearly five kilometres the path traversed by  light in one second. This approximation corresponds to a relative  value of a few hundred-thousandths, and it far exceeds those hitherto  attained by the best experimenters. When all the experiments are  completed, they will perhaps solve certain questions still in  suspense; for instance, the question whether the speed of propagation  depends on intensity. If this turns out to be the case, we should be  brought to the important conclusion that the amplitude of the  oscillations, which is certainly very small in relation to the already  tiny wave-lengths, cannot be considered as unimportant in regard to  these lengths. Such would seem to have been the result of the curious  experiments of M. Muller and of M. Ebert, but these results have been  recently disputed by M. Doubt.    In the case of sound vibrations, on the other hand, it should be noted  that experiment, consistently with the theory, proves that the speed  increases with the amplitude, or, if you will, with the intensity. M.  Violle has published an important series of experiments on the speed  of propagation of very condensed waves, on the deformations of these  waves, and on the relations of the speed and the pressure, which  verify in a remarkable manner the results foreshadowed by the already  old calculations of Riemann, repeated later by Hugoniot. If, on the  contrary, the amplitude is sufficiently small, there exists a speed  limit which is the same in a large pipe and in free air. By some  beautiful experiments, MM. Violle and Vautier have clearly shown that  any disturbance in the air melts somewhat quickly into a single wave  of given form, which is propagated to a distance, while gradually  becoming weaker and showing a constant speed which differs little in  dry air at 0 deg. C. from 331.36 metres per second. In a narrow pipe the  influence of the walls makes itself felt and produces various effects,  in particular a kind of dispersion in space of the harmonics of the  sound. This phenomenon, according to M. Brillouin, is perfectly  explicable by a theory similar to the theory of gratings.          CHAPTER III    PRINCIPLES      Sec. 1. THE PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS    Facts conscientiously observed lead by induction to the enunciation of  a certain number of laws or general hypotheses which are the  principles already referred to. These principal hypotheses are, in the  eyes of a physicist, legitimate generalizations, the consequences of  which we shall be able at once to check by the experiments from which  they issue.    Among the principles almost universally adopted until lately figure  prominently those of mechanics--such as the principle of relativity,  and the principle of the equality of action and reaction. We will not  detail nor discuss them here, but later on we shall have an  opportunity of pointing out how recent theories on the phenomena of  electricity have shaken the confidence of physicists in them and have  led certain scholars to doubt their absolute value.    The principle of Lavoisier, or principle of the conservation of mass,  presents itself under two different aspects according to whether mass  is looked upon as the coefficient of the inertia of matter or as the  factor which intervenes in the phenomena of universal attraction, and  particularly in gravitation. We shall see when we treat of these  theories, how we have been led to suppose that inertia depended on  velocity and even on direction. If this conception were exact, the  principle of the invariability of mass would naturally be destroyed.  Considered as a factor of attraction, is mass really indestructible?    A few years ago such a question would have seemed singularly  audacious. And yet the law of Lavoisier is so far from self-evident  that for centuries it escaped the notice of physicists and chemists.  But its great apparent simplicity and its high character of  generality, when enunciated at the end of the eighteenth century,  rapidly gave it such an authority that no one was able to any longer  dispute it unless he desired the reputation of an oddity inclined to  paradoxical ideas.    It is important, however, to remark that, under fallacious  metaphysical appearances, we are in reality using empty words  when we repeat the aphorism, \"Nothing can be lost, nothing can be  created,\" and deduce from it the indestructibility of matter. This  indestructibility, in truth, is an experimental fact, and the  principle depends on experiment. It may even seem, at first sight,  more singular than not that the weight of a bodily system in a given  place, or the quotient of this weight by that of"]]]
