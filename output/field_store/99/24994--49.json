I have still the old sail, with  four bullet-holes through it, made by the shots which they fired after  we had given cloth and got assurances of friendship. The father and  son of this village were the two men seen by the second boat preparing  to shoot; the fire of her crew struck the father on the chin and the  son on the head. It may have been for the best that the English are  thus known as people who can hit hard when unjustly attacked, as we on  this occasion most certainly were: never was a murderous assault more  unjustly made or less provoked. They had left their villages and gone  up over the highlands away from the river to their ambush whilst their  women came to look at us.    _2nd May, 1866._--Mountains again approach us, and we pass one which  was noticed in our first ascent from its resemblance to a table  mountain. It is 600 or 800 feet high, and called Liparu: the plateau  now becomes mountainous, giving forth a perennial stream which comes  down from its western base and forms a lagoon on the meadow-land that  flanks the Rovuma. The trees which love these perpetual streams spread  their roots all over the surface of the boggy banks, and make a firm  surface, but at spots one may sink a yard deep. We had to fill up  these deep ditches with branches and leaves, unload the animals, and  lead them across. We spent the night on the banks of the Liparu,[9]  and then proceeded on our way.    _3rd May, 1866._--We rested in a Makoa village, the head of which was  an old woman. The Makoa or Makoane are known by a half-moon figure  tattooed on their foreheads or elsewhere. Our poodle dog Chitane  chased the dogs of this village with unrelenting fury, his fierce  looks inspired terror among the wretched pariah dogs of a yellow and  white colour, and those looks were entirely owing to its being  difficult to distinguish at which end his head or tail lay. He enjoyed  the chase of the yelping curs immensely, but if one of them had turned  he would have bolted the other way.    A motherly-looking woman came forward and offered me some meal; this  was when we were in the act of departing: others had given food to the  men and no return had been made. I told her to send it on by her  husband, and I would purchase it, but it would have been better to  have accepted it: some give merely out of kindly feeling and with no  prospect of a return.    Many of the Makoa men have their faces thickly tattooed in double,  raised lines of about half an inch in length. After the incisions are  made charcoal is rubbed in and the flesh pressed out, so that all the  cuts are raised above the level of the surface. It gives them rather a  hideous look, and a good deal of that fierceness which our kings and  chiefs of old put on whilst having their portraits taken.    _4th May, 1866._--The stream, embowered in perpetual shade and  overspread with the roots of water-loving, broad-leaved trees, we  found to be called Nkonya. The spot of our encampment was an island  formed by a branch of it parting and re-entering it again: the owner  had used it for rice.    The buffaloes were bitten again by tsetse on 2nd, and also to-day,  from the bites of other flies (which look much more formidable than  tsetse), blood of arterial colour flows down; this symptom I never saw  before, but when we slaughtered an ox which had been tsetse bitten, we  observed that the blood had the arterial hue. The cow has inflammation  of one eye, and a swelling on the right lumbar portion of the pelvis:  the grey buffalo has been sick, but this I attribute to unmerciful  loading; for his back is hurt: the camels do not seem to feel the fly,  though they get weaker from the horrid running sores upon them and  hard work. There are no symptoms of tsetse in mules or donkeys, but  one mule has had his shoulder sprained, and he cannot stoop to eat or  drink.    We saw the last of the flanking range on the north. The country in  front is plain, with a few detached granitic peaks shot up. The Makoa  in large numbers live at the end of the range in a place called  Nyuchi. At Nyamba, a village where we spent the night of the 5th, was  a doctoress and rain-maker, who presented a large basket of soroko,  or, as they call it in India, \"mung,\" and a fowl. She is tall and well  made, with fine limbs and feet, and was profusely tattooed all over;  even her hips and buttocks had their elaborate markings: no shame is  felt in exposing these parts.    A good deal of salt is made by lixiviation of the soil and evaporating  by fire. The head woman had a tame khanga tole or tufted guinea-fowl,  with bluish instead of white spots.    In passing along westwards after leaving the end of the range, we came  first of all on sandstone hardened by fire; then masses of granite, as  if in that had been contained the igneous agency of partial  metamorphosis; it had also lifted up the sandstone, so as to cause a  dip to the east. Then the syenite or granite seemed as if it had been  melted, for it was all in striae, which striae, as they do elsewhere,  run east and west. With the change in geological structure we get a  different vegetation. Instead of the laurel-leaved trees of various  kinds, we have African ebonies, acacias, and mimosae: the grass is  shorter and more sparse, and we can move along without wood-cutting.  We were now opposite a hill on the south called Simba, a lion, from  its supposed resemblance to that animal. A large Mabiha population  live there, and make raids occasionally over to this side for slaves.    _6th May, 1866._--Tsetse again. The animals look drowsy. The cow's eye  is dimmed; when punctured, the skin emits a stream of scarlet blood.  The people hereabouts seem intelligent and respectful. At service a  man began to talk, but when I said, \"Ku soma Mlungu,\"--\"we wish to  pray to God,\" he desisted. It would be interesting to know what the  ideas of these men are, and to ascertain what they have gained in  their communings with nature during the ages past. They do not give  the idea of that boisterous wickedness and disregard of life which we  read of in our own dark ages, but I have no one to translate, although  I can understand much of what is said on common topics chiefly from  knowing other dialects.    _7th May, 1866._--A camel died during the night, and the grey buffalo  is in convulsions this morning. The cruelty of these sepoys vitiates  my experiment, and I quite expect many camels, one buffalo, and one  mule to die yet; they sit down and smoke and eat, leaving the animals  loaded in the sun. If I am not with them, it is a constant dawdling;  they are evidently unwilling to exert themselves, they cannot carry  their belts and bags, and their powers of eating and vomiting are  astounding. The Makonde villages are remarkably clean, but no sooner  do we pass a night in one than the fellows make it filthy. The climate  does give a sharp appetite, but these sepoys indulge it till relieved  by vomiting and purging. First of all they breakfast, then an hour  afterwards they are sitting eating the pocketfuls of corn maize they  have stolen and brought for the purpose, whilst I have to go ahead,  otherwise we may be misled into a zigzag course to see Ali's friends;  and if I remain behind to keep the sepoys on the move, it deprives me  of all the pleasure of travelling. We have not averaged four miles a  day in a straight line, yet the animals have often been kept in the  sun for eight hours at a stretch. When we get up at 4 A.M. we cannot  get under weigh before 8 o'clock. Sepoys are a mistake.    _7th May, 1866._--We are now opposite a mountain called Nabungala,  which resembles from the north-east an elephant lying down. Another  camel, a very good one, died on the way: its shiverings and  convulsions are not at all like what we observed in horses and oxen  killed by tsetse, but such may lie the cause, however. The only  symptom pointing to the tsetse is the arterial-looking blood, but we  never saw it ooze from the skin after the bite of the gad-fly as we do  now.    _8th May, 1866._--We arrived at a village called Jponde, or Liponde,  which lies opposite a granitic hill on the other-side of the river  (where we spent a night on our boat trip), called Nakapuri; this is  rather odd, for the words are not Makonde but Sichuana, and signify  goat's horn, from the projections jutting out from the rest of the  mass. I left the havildar, sepoys, and Nassick boys here in order to  make a forced march forward, where no food is to be had, and send  either to the south or westwards for supplies, so that after they have  rested the animals and themselves five days they may come. One mule is  very ill; one buffalo drowsy and exhausted; one camel a mere skeleton  from bad sores; and another has an enormous hole at the point of the  pelvis, which sticks out at the side. I suspect that this was made  maliciously, for he came from the field bleeding profusely; no tree  would have perforated a round hole in this way. I take all the goods  and leave only the sepoys' luggage, which is enough for all the  animals now.    _9th May, 1866._--I went on with the Johanna men and twenty-four  carriers, for it was a pleasure to get away from the sepoys and  Nassick boys; the two combined to overload the animals. I told them  repeatedly that they would kill them, but no sooner had I adjusted the  burdens and turned my back than they put on all their things. It was  however such continual vexation to contend with the sneaking spirit,  that I gave up annoying myself by seeing matters, though I felt  certain that the animals would all be killed. We did at least eight  miles pleasantly well, and slept at Moedaa village. The rocks are  still syenite. We passed a valley with the large thorny acacias of  which canoes are often made, and a euphorbiaceous tree, with  seed-v"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#9)"],[1,"Pandulf was present, he discreetly  permitted the Archbishop of Canterbury to crown Henry with the diadem of  St. Edward. \"This coronation,\" says the Canon of Barnwell, \"was  celebrated with such good order and such splendour that the oldest  magnates who were present declared that they had seen none of the king's  predecessors crowned with so much goodwill and tranquillity.\" Nor was  this the only great ecclesiastical function of the year. On July 7  Langton celebrated at Canterbury the translation of the relics of St.  Thomas to a magnificent shrine at the back of the high altar. Again the  legate gave precedence to the archbishop, and the presence of the young  king, of the Archbishop of Reims, and the Primate of Hungary, gave  distinction to the solemnity. It was a grand time for English saints.  When Damietta was taken from the Mohammedans, the crusaders dedicated  two of its churches to St. Thomas of Canterbury and St. Edmund the King.  A new saint was added to the calendar, who, if not an Englishman, had  done good work for the country of his adoption. In 1220 Honorius III.  canonised Hugh of Avalon, the Carthusian Bishop of Lincoln, on the  report of a commission presided over by Langton himself.        [1]: H.R. Luard, _On the Relations between England and Rome      during the Earlier Portion of the Reign of Henry III._ (1877),      illustrates papal influence at this period.    No real unity of principle underlay the external tranquillity. As time  went on Peter des Roches bitterly resented the growing preponderance of  Hubert de Burgh. Not all the self-restraint of the legate could commend  him to Langton, whose obstinate insistence upon his metropolitical  authority forced Pandulf to procure bulls from Rome specifically  releasing him from the jurisdiction of the primate. In these  circumstances it was natural for Bishop Peter and the legate to join  together against the justiciar and the archbishop. Finding that the  legate was too strong for him, Langton betook himself to Rome, and  remained there nearly a year. Before he went home he persuaded Honorius  to promise not to confer the same benefice twice by papal provision,  and to send no further legate to England during his lifetime. Pandulf  was at once recalled, and left England in July, 1221, a month before  his rival's return. He was compensated for the slight put upon him by  receiving his long-deferred consecration to Norwich at the hands of the  pope. There is small reason for believing that he was exceptionally  greedy or unpopular. But his withdrawal removed an influence which had  done its work for good, and was becoming a national danger. Langton  henceforth could act as the real head of the English Church. In 1222,  he held an important provincial council at Oseney abbey, near Oxford,  where he issued constitutions, famous as the first provincial canons  still recognised as binding in our ecclesiastical courts. He began once  more to concern himself with affairs of state, and Hubert found him a  sure ally. Bishop Peter, disgusted with his declining influence,  welcomed his appointment as archbishop of the crusading Church at  Damietta. He took the cross, and left England with Falkes de Breaute as  his companion. Learning that the crescent had driven the cross out of  his new see, he contented himself with making the pilgrimage to  Compostella, and soon found his way back to England, where he sought  for opportunities to regain power.    Relieved of the opposition of Bishop Peter, Hubert insisted on  depriving barons of doubtful loyalty of the custody of royal castles,  and found his chief opponent in William Earl of Albemarle. In dignity  and possessions, Albemarle was not ill-qualified to be a feudal leader.  The son of William de Fors, of Oleron, a Poitevin adventurer of the  type of Falkes de Breaute, he represented, through his mother, the line  of the counts of Aumale, who had since the Conquest ruled over  Holderness from their castle at Skipsea. The family acquired the status  of English earls under Stephen, retaining their foreign title,  expressed in English in the form of Albemarle, being the first house of  comital rank abroad to hold an earldom with a French name unassociated  with any English shire. During the civil war Albemarle's  tergiversations, which rivalled those of the Geoffrey de Mandeville of  Stephen's time, had been rewarded by large grants from the victorious  party. Since 1219 he suffered slight upon slight, and in 1220 was  stripped of the custody of Rockingham Castle. Late in that year Hubert  resolved to enforce an order, promulgated in 1217, which directed  Albemarle to restore to his former subtenant Bytham Castle, in South  Kesteven, of which he was overlord, and of which he had resumed  possession on account of the treason of his vassal. The earl hurried  away in indignation from the king's Christmas court, and in January,  1221, threw himself into Bytham, eager to hold it by force against the  king. For a brief space he ruled over the country-side after the  fashion of a baron of Stephen's time. He plundered the neighbouring  towns and churches, and filled the dungeons of Castle Bytham with  captives. On the pretext of attending a council at Westminster he  marched southwards, but his real motive was disclosed when he suddenly  attacked the castle of Fotheringhay. His men crossed the moat on the  ice, and, burning down the great gate, easily overpowered the scanty  garrison. \"As if he were the only ruler of the kingdom,\" says the Canon  of Barnwell, \"he sent letters signed with his seal to the mayors of the  cities of England, granting his peace to all merchants engaged in  plying their trades, and allowing them free licence of going and coming  through his castles.\" Nothing in the annals of the time puts more  clearly this revival of the old feudal custom that each baron should  lord it as king over his own estates.    Albemarle's power did not last long. He incurred the wrath of the  Church, and both in Kesteven and in Northamptonshire set himself  against the interests of Randolph of Chester. Before January was over  Pandulf excommunicated him, and a great council granted a special  scutage, \"the scutage of Bytham,\" to equip an army to crush the rebel.  Early in February a considerable force marched northwards against him.  The Earl of Chester took part in the campaign, and both the legate and  the king accompanied the army. Before the combined efforts of Church  and State, Albemarle dared not hold his ground, and fled to Fountains,  where he took sanctuary. His followers abandoned Fotheringhay, but  stood a siege at Bytham. After six days this castle was captured on  February 8. Even then secret sympathisers with Albemarle were able to  exercise influence on his behalf, and Pandulf himself was willing to  show mercy. The earl came out of sanctuary, and was pardoned on  condition of taking the crusader's vow. No effort was made to insist on  his going on crusade, and within a few months he was again in favour.  \"Thus,\" says Roger of Wendover, \"the king set the worst of examples,  and encouraged future rebellions.\" Randolph of Chester came out with  the spoils of victory. He secured as the price of his ostentatious  fidelity the custody of the Honour of Huntingdon, during the nonage of  the earl, his nephew, John the Scot.    A tumult in the capital soon taught Hubert that he had other foes to  fight against besides the feudal party. At a wrestling match, held on  July 25, 1222, between the city and the suburbs, the citizens won an  easy victory. The tenants of the Abbot of Westminster challenged the  conquerors to a fresh contest on August 1 at Westminster. But the  abbot's men were more anxious for revenge than good sport, and seeing  that the Londoners were likely to win, they violently broke up the  match. Suspecting no evil, the citizens had come without arms, and were  very severely handled by their rivals. Driven back behind their walls,  the Londoners clamoured for vengeance. Serlo the mercer, their mayor, a  prudent and peace-loving man, urged them to seek compensation of the  abbot. But the citizens preferred the advice of Constantine FitzAthulf,  who insisted upon an immediate attack on the men of Westminster. Next  day the abbey precincts were invaded, and much mischief was done. The  alarm was the greater because Constantine was a man of high position,  who had recently been a sheriff of London, and had once been a  strenuous supporter of Louis of France. It was rumoured that his  followers had raised the cry, \"Montjoie! Saint Denis!\" The quarrels of  neighbouring cities were as dangerous to sound rule as the feuds of  rival barons, and Hubert took instant measures to put down the  sedition. With the aid of Falkes de Breaute's mercenaries, order was  restored, and Constantine was led before the justiciar. Early next day  Falkes assembled his forces, and crossed the river to Southwark. He  took with him Constantine and two of his supporters, and hanged all  three, without form of trial, before the city knew anything about it.  Then Falkes and his soldiers rushed through the streets, capturing,  mutilating, and frightening away the citizens. Constantine's houses and  property were seized by the king. The weak Serlo was deposed from the  mayoralty, and the city taken into the king's hands. It was the last  time that Hubert and Falkes worked together, and something of the  violence of the _condottiere_ captain sullied the justiciar's  reputation. As the murderer of Constantine, Hubert was henceforth  pursued with the undying hatred of the Londoners.    During the next two years parties became clearly defined. Hubert more  and more controlled the royal policy, and strove to strengthen both his  master and himself by marriage alliances. Powerful husbands were sought  for the king's three sisters. On June 19, 1221, Joan, Henry's second  sister, was married to the young Alexander of"]]]
