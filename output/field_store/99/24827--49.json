To give the entire range of household  occupations to all girls is a simple and logical arrangement.    But man's labor is greatly specialized throughout. There is no large  remnant of unspecialized labor common to all, as in the case of women.  To all girls we give simply this unspecialized remnant, since it is  large and important. But in the case of men the unspecialized field  has disappeared. There is nothing of labor to give to boys except that  which has become specialized.    A fundamental problem arises. Shall we give boys access to a variety  of specialized occupations so that they may become acquainted, through  responsible performance, with the wide and diversified field of man's  labor? Or shall we give them some less specialized sample out of  that diversified field so that they may obtain, through contact and  experience, some knowledge of the things that make up the world of  productive labor?    Cleveland's reply, to judge from actual practices, is that a single  sample will be sufficient for all except those who attend technical  and special schools. The city has therefore chosen joinery and  cabinet-making as this sample. In the fifth and sixth grades work  begins in simple knife-work for an hour a week under the direction of  women teachers. In the seventh and eighth grades it becomes benchwork  for an hour and a half per week, and is taught by a special manual  training teacher, always a man. In the academic high schools the  courses in joinery and cabinet-making bring the pupils to greater  proficiency, but do not greatly extend the course in width.    Much of this work is of a rather formal character, apparently looking  toward that manual discipline formerly called \"training of eye and  hand,\" instead of consciously answering to the demands of social  purposes. The regular teachers look upon the fifth and sixth grade  sloyd[*sic] which they teach with no great enthusiasm. Seventh and  eighth grade teachers do not greatly value the work.    The household arts courses for the girls have social purposes in view.  As a result they are kept vitalized, and are growing increasingly  vital in the work of the city. Is it not possible also to vitalize the  manual training of the boys--unspecialized pre-vocational training, we  ought to call it--by giving it social purpose?    The principal of one of the academic high schools emphasized in  conversation the value of manual training for vocational guidance--a  social purpose. It permitted boys, he said, to try themselves out  and to find their vocational tastes and aptitudes. The purpose is  undoubtedly a valid one. The limitation of the method is that joinery  and cabinet-making cannot help a boy to try himself out for metal  work, printing, gardening, tailoring, or commercial work.    If vocational guidance is to be a controlling social purpose, the  manual training work will have to be made more diversified so that  one can try out his tastes and abilities in a number of lines. And,  moreover, each kind of work must be kept as much like responsible work  out in the world as possible. In keeping work normal, the main thing  is that the pupils bear actual responsibility for the doing of actual  work. This is rather difficult to arrange; but it is necessary before  the activities can be lifted above the level of the usual manual  training shop. The earliest stages of the training will naturally be  upon what is little more than a play level. It is well for schools to  give free rein to the constructive instinct and to provide the fullest  and widest possible opportunities for its exercise. But if boys are  to try out their aptitudes for work and their ability to bear  responsibility in work, then they must try themselves out on the  work level. Let the manual training actually look toward vocational  guidance; the social purpose involved will vitalize the work.    There is a still more comprehensive social purpose which the city  should consider. Owing to the interdependence of human affairs, men  need to be broadly informed as to the great world of productive  labor. Most of our civic and social problems are at bottom industrial  problems. Just as we use industrial history and industrial geography  as means of giving youth a wide vision of the fields of man's work,  so must we also use actual practical activities as means of making  him familiar in a concrete way with materials and processes in  their details, with the nature of work, and with the nature of  responsibility. On the play level, therefore, constructive activities  should be richly diversified. This diversity of opportunity should  continue to the work level. One cannot really know the nature of work  or of work responsibility except as it is learned through experience.  Let the manual training adopt the social purpose here mentioned,  provide the opportunities, means, and processes that it demands, and  the work will be wondrously vitalized.    It is well to mention that the program suggested is a complicated  one on the side of its theory and a difficult one on the side of its  practice. In the planning it is well to look to the whole program. In  the work itself it is well to remember that one step at a time, and  that secure, is a good way to avoid stumbling.    Printing and gardening are two things that might well be added to  the manual training program. Both are already in the schools in some  degree. They might well be considered as desirable portions of  the manual training of all. They lend themselves rather easily to  responsible performance on the work level. There are innumerable  things that a school can print for use in its work. In so doing,  pupils can be given something other than play. Also in the home  gardening, supervised for educational purposes, it is possible to  introduce normal work-motives. By the time the city has developed  these two things it will have at the same time developed the insight  necessary for attacking more difficult problems.          ELEMENTARY SCIENCE      This subject finds no place upon the program. No elaborate argument  should be required to convince the authorities in charge of the school  system of a modern city like Cleveland that in this ultra-scientific  age the children who do not go beyond the elementary school--and they  constitute a majority--need to possess a working knowledge of the  rudiments of science if they are to make their lives effective.    The future citizens of Cleveland need to know something about  electricity, heat, expansion and contraction of gases and solids, the  mechanics of machines, distillation, common chemical reactions and a  host of other things about science that are bound to come up in the  day's work in their various activities.    Considered from the practical standpoint of actual human needs, the  present almost complete neglect of elementary science is indefensible.  The minute amount of such teaching now introduced in the language  lessons for composition purposes is so small as to be almost  negligible. The topics are not chosen for their bearing upon human  needs. There is no laboratory work.    Naturally much of the elementary science to be taught should be  introduced in connection with practical situations in kitchen, school  garden, shop, sanitation, etc. Certainly the applied science should  be as full as possible. But preliminary to this there ought to be  systematic presentation of the elements of various sciences in rapid  ways for overview and perspective.    To try to teach the elements only \"incidentally\" as they are applied  is to fail to see them in their relations, and therefore to fail in  understanding them. Intensive studies by way of filling in the  details may well be in part incidental. But systematic superficial  introductory work is needed by way of giving pupils their bearings  in the various fields of science. The term \"superficial\" is used  advisedly. There is an introductory stage in the teaching of every  such subject when the work should be superficial and extensive. This  stage paves the way for depth and intensity, which must be reached  before education is accomplished.          HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE      Having no elementary science in the grades, one naturally expects to  find in the high school a good introductory course in general science,  similar in organization to that suggested for the elementary stage.  But nowhere is there anything that even remotely suggests such a  course. Students who take the classical course get their first glimpse  of modern science in the third or fourth high school year, when they  have an opportunity to elect a course in physics or chemistry of the  usual traditional stamp. No opportunity is given them for so much as  a glimpse of the world's biological background. Those who take the  scientific or English course have access to physical geography and to  an anemic biological course entitled, \"Physiology and Botany,\" which  few take. Students of the High School of Commerce have their first  contacts with modern science in a required course in chemistry in the  third year, and elective physics in the fourth year. In the technical  high schools the first science for the boys is systematic chemistry in  the second year and physics in the third. They have no opportunity  of contact with any biological science. The girls have \"botany and  physiology\" in their first year.    The city needs to organize preliminary work in general science for the  purpose of paving the way to the more intensive science work of the  later years. A portion of this should be found in the elementary  school and taught by departmental science teachers; and a portion  in the first year of the high school. As junior high schools are  developed, most of this work should be included in their courses.    As to the later organization of the work, the two technical high  schools clearly indicate the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#9)"],[1,"the foemen that the Masters of God-home         would grieve.\"      Said the next: \"'Tis a wonder of wonders, that the hearkening world shall         believe.\"      \"A fear of all fears,\" said the third, \"for the sword is uplifted on men.\"      \"A joy of all joys,\" said the fourth, \"once come, and it comes not again!\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"What then hath betid,\" said King Elf, \"do the high Gods stand in our gate?\"      \"Nay,\" said they, \"else were we silent, and they should be telling of fate.\"      \"Is the bidding come,\" said the Helper, \"that we wend the Gods to see?\"      \"Many summers and winters,\" they said, \"ye shall live on the earth, it may       be.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"Speak then,\" said the ancient Helper, \"let the worst and the best be said.\"           *       *       *       *       *      They said: \"The earth is weary: but the tender blade hath sprung,    That shall wax till beneath its branches fair bloom the meadows green;    For the Gods and they that were mighty were glad erewhile with the Queen.\"      Said King Elf: \"How say ye, women? Of a King new-born do ye tell,    By a God of the Heavens begotten in our fathers' house to dwell?\"      \"By a God of the Earth,\" they answered; \"but greater yet is the son,    Though long were the days of Sigmund, and great are the deeds he hath done.\"      Then she with the golden burden to the kingly high-seat stepped    And away from the new-born baby the purple cloths she swept,    And cried: \"O King of the people, long mayst thou live in bliss,    As our hearts today are happy! Queen Hiordis sends thee this,    And she saith that the world shall call it by the name that thou shalt name;    Now the gift to thee is given, and to thee is brought the fame.\"      Then e'en as a man astonied King Elf the Volsung took,    While his feast-hall's ancient timbers with the cry of the earl-folk shook;           *       *       *       *       *      With the love of many peoples was the wise king smitten through,    As he hung o'er the new-born Volsung: but at last he raised his head,    And looked forth kind o'er his people, and spake aloud and said:      \"O Sigmund King of Battle; O man of many days,    Whom I saw mid the shields of the fallen and the dead men's silent praise,    Lo, how hath the dark tide perished and the dawn of day begun!    And now, O mighty Sigmund, wherewith shall we name thy son?\"      But there rose up a man most ancient, and he cried: \"Hail Dawn of the Day!    How many things shalt thou quicken, how many shalt thou slay!    How many things shalt thou waken, how many lull to sleep!    How many things shalt thou scatter, how many gather and keep!    O me, how thy love shall cherish, how thine hate shall wither and burn!    How the hope shall be sped from thy right hand, nor the fear to thy left         return!    O thy deeds that men shall sing of! O thy deeds that the Gods shall see!    O SIGURD, Son of the Volsungs, O Victory yet to be!\"      Men heard the name and they knew it, and they caught it up in the air,    And it went abroad by the windows and the doors of the feast-hall fair,    It went through street and market; o'er meadow and acre it went,    And over the wind-stirred forest and the dearth of the sea-beat bent,    And over the sea-flood's welter, till the folk of the fishers heard,    And the hearts of the isle-abiders on the sun-scorched rocks were stirred.           *       *       *       *       *      _Sigurd getteth to him the horse that is called Greyfell._      Now waxeth the son of Sigmund in might and goodliness,    And soft the days win over, and all men his beauty bless.    But amidst the summer season was the Isle-queen Hiordis wed    To King Elf the son of the Helper, and fair their life-days sped.    Peace lay on the land for ever, and the fields gave good increase,    And there was Sigurd waxing mid the plenty and the peace.    Now hath the child grown greater, and is keen and eager of wit    And full of understanding, and oft hath he joy to sit    Amid talk of weighty matters when the wise men meet for speech;    And joyous he is moreover and blithe and kind with each.    But Regin the wise craftsmaster heedeth the youngling well,    And before the Kings he cometh, and saith such words to tell.      \"I have fostered thy youth, King Elf, and thine O Helper of men,    And ye wot that such a master no king shall see again;    And now would I foster Sigurd; for, though he be none of thy blood,    Mine heart of his days that shall be speaketh abundant good.\"      Then spake the Helper of men-folk: \"Yea, do herein thy will:    For thou art the Master of Masters, and hast learned me all my skill:    But think how bright is this youngling, and thy guile from him withhold;    For this craft of thine hath shown me that thy heart is grim and cold,    Though three men's lives thrice over thy wisdom might not learn;    And I love this son of Sigmund, and mine heart to him doth yearn.\"      Then Regin laughed, and answered: \"I doled out cunning to thee;    But nought with him will I measure: yet no cold-heart shall he be,    Nor grim, nor evil-natured: for whate'er my will might frame,    Gone forth is the word of the Norns, that abideth ever the same.    And now, despite my cunning, how deem ye I shall die?\"      And they said he would live as he listed, and at last in peace should lie    When he listed to live no longer; so mighty and wise he was.      But again he laughed and answered: \"One day it shall come to pass,    That a beardless youth shall slay me: I know the fateful doom;    But nought may I withstand it, as it heaves up dim through the gloom.\"      So is Sigurd now with Regin, and he learns him many things;    Yea, all save the craft of battle, that men learned the sons of kings:    The smithying sword and war-coat; the carving runes aright;    The tongues of many countries, and soft speech for men's delight;    The dealing with the harp-strings, and the winding ways of song.    So wise of heart waxed Sigurd, and of body wondrous strong:    And he chased the deer of the forest, and many a wood-wolf slew,    And many a bull of the mountains: and the desert dales he knew,    And the heaths that the wind sweeps over; and seaward would he fare,    Far out from the outer skerries, and alone the sea-wights dare.    One day did Regin tell Sigurd of deeds done in the past by kings both  bold and wise, and the lad longed, too, to do the like, and his  bright eyes glowed with desire. And Regin told him that he should  follow his Volsung fathers and roam far and wide, leaving the  peace-lovers and home-abiders who had cherished his youth.    This roused Sigurd's wrath, for he would have nought said against  those who had reared him, but Regin bade him ask for one of the  horses of Gripir, and banished his anger by a song of the deeds of  the Choosers of the Slain. Before the song was finished Sigurd went  to King Elf and asked that he might have authority to seek a horse  from King Gripir.      Then smiled King Elf, and answered: \"A long way wilt thou ride,    To where unpeace and troubles and the griefs of the soul abide,    Yea unto the death at the last: yet surely shall thou win    The praise of many a people: so have thy way herein.    Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold    The sun of the early dawning, that turneth it all unto gold.\"      Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them; and through the night he lay    Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way;    Then he shook the sleep from off him, and that dwelling of Kings he left    And wended his ways unto Gripir. On a crag from the mountain reft    Was the house of the old King builded; and a mighty house it was,    Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass:    But the wild ernes cried about it, and the vultures toward it flew,    And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber         through,    And about were meads wide-spreading; and many a beast thereon,    Yea some that are men-folk's terror, their sport and pasture won.      So into the hall went Sigurd; and amidst was Gripir set    In a chair of the sea-beast's tooth; and his sweeping beard nigh met    The floor that was green as the ocean, and his gown was of mountain-gold,    And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold.      Now the first of the twain spake Gripir: \"Hail King with the eyen bright!    Nought needest thou show the token, for I know of thy life and thy light.    And no need to tell of thy message; it was wafted here on the wind,    That thou wouldst be coming today a horse in my meadow to find:    And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall be.    Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my lea.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Then again gat Sigurd outward, and adown the steep he ran    And unto the horse-fed meadow: but lo, a grey-clad man,    One-eyed and seeming ancient, there met him by the way:    And he spake: \"Thou hastest, Sigurd; yet tarry till I say    A word that shall well bestead thee: for I know of these mountains well    And all the lea of Gripir, and the beasts that thereon dwell.\"      \"Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings? art thou Gripir's horse-herd         then?    Nay sure, for thy face is shining like the battle-eager men    My master Regin tells of: and I love thy cloud-grey gown,    And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known.\"      \"Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind,\" then spake that elder of days,    \"And sooth do the sages say, when the beasts of my breeding they praise.    There is one thereof in the meadow, and, wouldst thou cull him out,    Thou shalt follow an elder's counsel, who hath brought strange things about,    Who hath known thy father aforetime, and other kings of thy kin.\"      So"]]]
