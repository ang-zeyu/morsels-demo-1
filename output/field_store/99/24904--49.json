Last night, as soon as I realised how bad the storm was, I made up  my mind that I had better attempt to enter the house. I succeeded after  some trouble, came to this room, turned on the light--a spooky thing; an  empty house, picked up a book, had quite forgotten my position, the  world, everything, when a voice at my elbow said: 'Fond of reading?' I  was never more surprised in my life. I felt distinctly caught,--an  interloper. And to make matters worse, I saw that Holland did not at  once recognise me. I made every effort to leave, but he would not hear  of such a thing. He made it perfectly plain in fact that it was his wish  to keep me. I yielded. That, I think, Holland, is a pretty accurate  account of the night's proceeding, isn't it?\"    Geoffrey did not answer. His soul rebelled at the farce, and at McVay's  irrepressible enjoyment of his own abilities. As Holland met the  twinkling joy of those small blue eyes, he wondered if he would not be  doing mankind a favour by putting a bullet into McVay before the dawn of  another day. Unconscious of this possibility, McVay continued to his  sister:    \"Well, it has all been a painful experience for you, my dear... a long  and dangerous adventure for a woman, but you were at least warmly clad.  A handsome coat, is it not, Holland?\"    \"Very,\" said Geoffrey chillingly.    \"Now that coat,\" McVay went on unchilled, \"was a real bargain. I may say  I paid nothing for it,--little more than the trouble of taking it home.  Although from another point of view, its price was pretty high....\"    \"Really, Billy, I don't think Mr. Holland is interested in our  bargains.\"    \"In _some_, he is.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Geoffrey, eyeing McVay with a warning glance, \"I  think I know of just about a dozen people who will want a circumstantial  account of all of them.\"    \"Now there, Holland, there is one of your philistine  words,--circumstantial! It takes all poetry, all imagination out of a  subject. Do you know, the only connotation--(are you familiar with that  word?)--the only suggestion it has for me is a _jury_?\"    He scored distinctly. Geoffrey had nothing to say in reply.    It was McVay himself, who, disliking a pause, observed that it was  almost time to begin on the preparation of the Christmas dinner. They  all rose as if glad of a break. As they passed out of the door, Geoffrey  laid his hand on McVay's arm.    \"Why do you deliberately try to exasperate me?\" he said.    McVay smiled. \"Why do little boys lay their tongues to lamp-posts in  freezing weather? Don't I amuse you? Be candid.\"    \"No.\"    McVay looked regretful. \"As I remembered you, Holland, as a boy, you had  more sense of humour,\" he said gently.          VI      In the kitchen McVay made it evident that his talents were for  organisation rather than for hard labour. He drew a chair near the wall,  and tilting back at his ease, watched Geoffrey and Cecilia at work.  Geoffrey, engaged in lighting the range-fire, looked up at her as she  moved about filling the kettle and washing out pots and pans, and  thought that he and she presented the aspect of a young couple of the  labouring class with no further ambition than to keep a roof over their  heads. He almost had it in his heart to wish that they were.    She proved herself infinitely more capable than the two men had been,  discovering tins of butter and soup and sardines, a package of hominy,  apples and potatoes in the cellar, and an old box of wedding cake,  which, with a burning brandy sauce, she declared would serve very well  for plum-pudding.    Manual labour was such a novelty to Geoffrey that he soon forgot even  his irritation against McVay and the triangular intercourse was more  friendly than before, until marred by an unfortunate incident.    He was standing in the middle of the kitchen with a steaming pot in each  hand, when McVay, without warning, advanced toward him, handkerchief in  hand, exclaiming:    \"My dear fellow, such a smut on your forehead, pray allow me--\"    [Illustration: \"MY DEAR FELLOW--PRAY ALLOW ME\"]    \"Look out,\" roared Geoffrey, realising how easily in another second his  revolver might be taken from him. The tone was alarming, and McVay  sprang back ten feet. \"I was afraid of burning you with the soup,\"  Geoffrey explained politely.    \"I own you made me jump,\" said McVay.    The girl said nothing, and Geoffrey feared the incident had made an  unfortunate impression on her.    It appeared to be completely forgotten, however, when they presently sat  down to their Christmas dinner, of which they all expressed themselves  as inordinately proud. There was canned soup, and sardines and toasted  biscuits, canned corned beef, potatoes and fried hominy, bacon and a  potato salad, a bottle of champagne, and finally the wedding cake.    Now to say that by the time dessert was put on table McVay was drunk  would be to do him a gross injustice. All the more genial side of this  nature, however, was distinctly emphasised. The better part of a quart  of champagne had not produced any signs of intoxication; his eye was  clear, his speech perfect, and he was more than usually aware of his own  powers, confident of appreciation.    As he finished his share of cake, he rose to his feet, and leaning the  tips of his fingers on the table, addressed Geoffrey.    \"My dear Holland,\" he said, \"I will not wish you a Merry Christmas, for  it has already been as merry as it has lain within my poor capacity to  make it. Let me, however, express my own gratitude to you for this  delightful occasion. You have referred to the fare as meagre, to our  position as constrained, but believe me, I am not exaggerating when I  say that I so little agree with you that I am confident that, during  many of the remaining years of my life I shall look back to this  Christmas as one of unusual luxury and freedom. It is, perhaps, the warm  glow of friendship that gilds all small discomforts, for in situations  like ours characters are tested, and yours, Holland,\" he paused  impressively, \"has stood the test.\"    Geoffrey bowed gratefully, and McVay continued:    \"I have here a slight token in honour of the day. It is of little  pecuniary value, but between us, Holland, pecuniary value is no longer  mentioned. I feel that it will be recommended to you more than mere  worth could recommend it by the fact that it is peculiarly my own,--my  own as few human possessions can be said to be. I offer it,\" he said,  drawing from his pocket a square flat little package, \"with best wishes  for a happy New Year.\"    [Illustration: \"I HAVE HERE A SLIGHT TOKEN, IN HONOR OF THE DAY\"]    The idea that McVay was going to give him a present had never crossed  Geoffrey's mind, and now it struck him as so characteristic, so  perfectly in keeping with McVay's consuming desire to triumph in minor  matters, that he was able to smile pleasantly and receive it  appropriately. He exchanged a glance of real appreciation with the  donor, and received a grave bow in return.    Cecilia smiled, too, \"I don't know exactly why you should think Mr.  Holland wants your picture, Billy,\" she said.    \"It may be of the greatest service to him,\" said McVay.    The girl turned to Geoffrey. \"I can't make a speech like Billy's,\" she  said, \"but I have a small present for you which I hope you won't despise  because it is not new. I mean I have worn it myself for some time, and I  hope _you_ will now, in remembrance of the time when you sheltered the  houseless.\" She held out on her pink palm a flat gold pencil with a  single topaz set in the top.    The thing was of some value and Geoffrey, looking up, caught McVay's eye  in which danced such a delicious merriment that Geoffrey's half-formed  question was answered. McVay was undergoing such paroxysms of delight at  the idea that Geoffrey was about to become a receiver of stolen goods  that he could not well conceal it. And instinctively Geoffrey drew back  his hand. The next moment he realised that he must at once accept the  gift with decent gratitude, whatever he might choose to do with it  afterward, but unfortunately the girl had noticed his hesitation.    She said nothing whatsoever, but she closed her hand on the pencil, rose  from the table, and left them to dispose of the remains of the feast as  best they could.    McVay, as if he had observed nothing, threw himself at once into the  part of a waiter, tucked a napkin round his waist, flung another over  his arm and began to clear the table.    \"Wait a moment,\" said Geoffrey, who had not followed his example; \"I  have something to say to you. I see you are in possession of my  sentiments in regard to your sister.... I think her a wonder,--that's  all it is necessary for you to know.\"    \"Quite naturally, Holland. She is, she is.\"    \"I won't discuss that with you. The point is that you seem to be under  the impression that this will do you some good. Well, it won't. You  stand just where you did before. You go to jail when the snow melts.  Then I settle my affairs.\"    McVay's face fell. \"Really, Holland,\" he said, \"I don't see how, if you  are fond of a woman you can want ...\"    \"... to spare her such a brother as you. Think it over.\"    \"There are worse brothers than I,\" replied McVay, \"how many men would  have sacrificed what I have sacrificed in order to keep her  comfortably.\"    \"Not many, I hope.\"    \"She is extraordinarily fond of me.\"    \"Perhaps. You see she has not any one else to be fond of.\"    \"We can scarcely say that _now_,\" returned McVay encouragingly.    \"I won't discuss it with you.\"    \"You can't mean to tell me that you are in love with my sister and mean  to send me to state's prison?\"    \"I mean exactly that.\"    \"Why, she'd never forgive you.\"    Geoffrey"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#9)"],[1,"the youngster's future assured,  because this man so lavish in violence was equally so in generosity.  In time there would be a bit of land and a good flock of sheep for the  urchin.    These adoptions at first aroused in Misia Petrona a little  rebellion--the only ones of her life; but the centaur soon reduced her  to terrified silence.    \"And you dare to complain of me, you weak cow! . . . A woman who has  only given me daughters. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"    The same hand that negligently extracted from his pocket a wad of bills  rolled into a ball, giving them away capriciously without knowing just  how much, also wore a lash hanging from the wrist. It was supposed to be  for his horse, but it was used with equal facility when any of his peons  incurred his wrath.    \"I strike because I can,\" he would say to pacify himself.    One day, the man receiving the blow, took a step backward, hunting for  the knife in his belt.    \"You are not going to beat me, Patron. I was not born in these parts.  . . . I come from Corrientes.\"    The Patron remained with upraised thong. \"Is it true that you were not  born here? . . . Then you are right; I cannot beat you. Here are five  dollars for you.\"    When Desnoyers came on the place, Madariaga was beginning to lose count  of those who were under his dominion in the old Latin sense, and could  take his blows. There were so many that confusion often reigned.    The Frenchman admired the Patron's expert eye for his business. It was  enough for him to contemplate for a few moments a herd of cattle, to  know its exact number. He would go galloping along with an indifferent  air, around an immense group of horned and stamping beasts, and  then would suddenly begin to separate the different animals. He had  discovered that they were sick. With a buyer like Madariaga, all the  tricks and sharp practice of the drovers came to naught.    His serenity before trouble was also admirable. A drought suddenly  strewed his plains with dead cattle, making the land seem like an  abandoned battlefield. Everywhere great black hulks. In the air, great  spirals of crows coming from leagues away. At other times, it was the  cold; an unexpected drop in the thermometer would cover the ground with  dead bodies. Ten thousand animals, fifteen thousand, perhaps more, all  perished!    \"WHAT a knock-out!\" Madariaga would exclaim with resignation. \"Without  such troubles, this earth would be a paradise. . . . Now, the thing to  do is to save the skins!\"    And he would rail against the false pride of the emigrants, against the  new customs among the poor which prevented his securing enough hands to  strip the victims quickly, so that thousands of hides had to be lost.  Their bones whitened the earth like heaps of snow. The peoncitos (little  peons) went around putting the skulls of cows with crumpled horns on  the posts of the wire fences--a rustic decoration which suggested a  procession of Grecian lyres.    \"It is lucky that the land is left, anyway!\" added the ranchman.    He loved to race around his immense fields when they were beginning to  turn green in the late rains. He had been among the first to convert  these virgin wastes into rich meadow-lands, supplementing the natural  pasturage with alfalfa. Where one beast had found sustenance before, he  now had three. \"The table is set,\" he would chuckle, \"we must now go  in search of the guests.\" And he kept on buying, at ridiculous prices,  herds dying of hunger in others' uncultivated fields, constantly  increasing his opulent lands and stock.    One morning Desnoyers saved his life. The old ranchman had raised his  lash against a recently arrived peon who returned the attack, knife in  hand. Madariaga was defending himself as best he could, convinced  from one minute to another that he was going to receive the deadly  knife-thrust--when Desnoyers arrived and, drawing his revolver, overcame  and disarmed the adversary.    \"Thanks, Frenchy,\" said the ranchman, much touched. \"You are an  all-round man, and I am going to reward you. From this day I shall speak  to you as I do to my family.\"    Desnoyers did not know just what this familiar talk might amount to,  for his employer was so peculiar. Certain personal favors, nevertheless,  immediately began to improve his position. He was no longer allowed to  eat in the administration building, the proprietor insisting imperiously  that henceforth Desnoyers should sit at his own table, and thus he was  admitted into the intimate life of the Madariaga family.    The wife was always silent when her husband was present. She was used to  rising in the middle of the night in order to oversee the breakfasts  of the peons, the distribution of biscuit, and the boiling of the great  black kettles of coffee or shrub tea. She looked after the chattering  and lazy maids who so easily managed to get lost in the nearby groves.  In the kitchen, too, she made her authority felt like a regular  house-mistress, but the minute that she heard her husband's voice she  shrank into a respectful and timorous silence. Upon sitting down at  table, the China would look at him with devoted submission, her great,  round eyes fixed on him, like an owl's. Desnoyers felt that in this mute  admiration was mingled great astonishment at the energy with which the  ranchman, already over seventy, was continuing to bring new occupants to  live on his demesne.    The two daughters, Luisa and Elena, accepted with enthusiasm the new  arrival who came to enliven the monotonous conversations in the dining  room, so often cut short by their father's wrathful outbursts. Besides,  he was from Paris. \"Paris!\" sighed Elena, the younger one, rolling her  eyes. And Desnoyers was henceforth consulted in all matters of style  every time they ordered any \"confections\" from the shops of Buenos  Aires.    The interior of the house reflected the different tastes of the two  generations. The girls had a parlor with a few handsome pieces of  furniture placed against the cracked walls, and some showy lamps that  were never lighted. The father, with his boorishness, often invaded this  room so cherished and admired by the two sisters, making the carpets  look shabby and faded under his muddy boot-tracks. Upon the gilt  centre-table, he loved to lay his lash. Samples of maize scattered  its grains over a silk sofa which the young ladies tried to keep very  choice, as though they feared it might break.    Near the entrance to the dining room was a weighing machine, and  Madariaga became furious when his daughters asked him to remove it to  the offices. He was not going to trouble himself to go outside every  time that he wanted to know the weight of a leather skin! . . . A piano  came into the ranch, and Elena passed the hours practising exercises  with desperate good will. \"Heavens and earth! She might at least play  the Jota or the Perican, or some other lively Spanish dance!\" And  the irate father, at the hour of siesta, betook himself to the nearby  eucalyptus trees, to sleep upon his poncho.    This younger daughter whom he dubbed La Romantica, was the special  victim of his wrath and ridicule. Where had she picked up so many tastes  which he and his good China never had had? Music books were piled on the  piano. In a corner of the absurd parlor were some wooden boxes that had  held preserves, which the ranch carpenter had been made to press into  service as a bookcase.    \"Look here, Frenchy,\" scoffed Madariaga. \"All these are novels and  poems! Pure lies! . . . Hot air!\"    He had his private library, vastly more important and glorious, and  occupying less space. In his desk, adorned with guns, thongs, and chaps  studded with silver, was a little compartment containing deeds and  various legal documents which the ranchman surveyed with great pride.    \"Pay attention, now and hear marvellous things,\" announced the master to  Desnoyers, as he took out one of his memorandum books.    This volume contained the pedigree of the famous animals which had  improved his breeds of stock, the genealogical trees, the patents of  nobility of his aristocratic beasts. He would have to read its contents  to him since he did not permit even his family to touch these records.  And with his spectacles on the end of his nose, he would spell out the  credentials of each animal celebrity. \"Diamond III, grandson of Diamond  I, owned by the King of England, son of Diamond II, winner in the  races.\" His Diamond had cost him many thousands, but the finest horses  on the ranch, those which brought the most marvellous prices, were his  descendants.    \"That horse had more sense than most people. He only lacked the power  to talk. He's the one that's stuffed, near the door of the parlor. The  girls wanted him thrown out. . . . Just let them dare to touch him! I'd  chuck them out first!\"    Then he would continue reading the history of a dynasty of bulls  with distinctive names and a succession of Roman numbers, the same as  kings--animals acquired by the stubborn ranchman in the great cattle  fairs of England. He had never been there, but he had used the cable in  order to compete in pounds sterling with the British owners who wished  to keep such valuable stock in their own country. Thanks to these  blue-blooded sires that had crossed the ocean with all the luxury of  millionaire passengers, he had been able to exhibit in the concourses  of Buenos Aires animals which were veritable towers of meat, edible  elephants with their sides as fit and sleek as a table.    \"That book amounts to something! Don't you think so, Frenchy? It is  worth more than all those pictures of moons, lakes, lovers and other  gewgaws that my Romantica puts on the walls to catch the dust.\"    And he would point out, in contrast, the precious diplomas which were  adorning his desk, the metal vases and other trophies won in the fairs  by the descendants of his blooded stock.    Luisa, the elder "]]]
