Notwithstanding, it is not seemly to let the hair pass beyond the limit of  the ears. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Lord of all worlds.    45 Exile and imprisonment are decreed for the thief, and, on the third  offence, place ye a mark upon his brow so that, thus identified, he may  not be accepted in the cities of God and His countries. Beware lest,  through compassion, ye neglect to carry out the statutes of the religion  of God; do that which hath been bidden you by Him Who is compassionate and  merciful. We school you with the rod of wisdom and laws, like unto the  father who educateth his son, and this for naught but the protection of  your own selves and the elevation of your stations. By My life, were ye to  discover what We have desired for you in revealing Our holy laws, ye would  offer up your very souls for this sacred, this mighty, and most exalted  Faith.    46 Whoso wisheth to make use of vessels of silver and gold is at liberty  to do so. Take heed lest, when partaking of food, ye plunge your hands  into the contents of bowls and platters. Adopt ye such usages as are most  in keeping with refinement. He, verily, desireth to see in you the manners  of the inmates of Paradise in His mighty and most sublime Kingdom. Hold ye  fast unto refinement under all conditions, that your eyes may be preserved  from beholding what is repugnant both to your own selves and to the  dwellers of Paradise. Should anyone depart therefrom, his deed shall at  that moment be rendered vain; yet should he have good reason, God will  excuse him. He, in truth, is the Gracious, the Most Bountiful.    47 He Who is the Dawning-place of God's Cause hath no partner in the Most  Great Infallibility. He it is Who, in the kingdom of creation, is the  Manifestation of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\". God hath reserved this  distinction unto His own Self, and ordained for none a share in so sublime  and transcendent a station. This is the Decree of God, concealed ere now  within the veil of impenetrable mystery. We have disclosed it in this  Revelation, and have thereby rent asunder the veils of such as have failed  to recognize that which the Book of God set forth and who were numbered  with the heedless.    48 Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and  daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid  down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is commanded unto  him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is required for  their instruction if he be wealthy and, if not, the matter devolveth upon  the House of Justice. Verily have We made it a shelter for the poor and  needy. He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though  he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My glory, My  loving-kindness, My mercy, that have compassed the world.    49 God hath imposed a fine on every adulterer and adulteress, to be paid  to the House of Justice: nine mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold, to be doubled if they  should repeat the offence. Such is the penalty which He Who is the Lord of  Names hath assigned them in this world; and in the world to come He hath  ordained for them a humiliating torment. Should anyone be afflicted by a  sin, it behoveth him to repent thereof and return unto his Lord. He,  verily, granteth forgiveness unto whomsoever He willeth, and none may  question that which it pleaseth Him to ordain. He is, in truth, the  Ever-Forgiving, the Almighty, the All-Praised.    50 Beware lest ye be hindered by the veils of glory from partaking of the  crystal waters of this living Fountain. Seize ye the chalice of salvation  at this dawntide in the name of Him Who causeth the day to break, and  drink your fill in praise of Him Who is the All-Glorious, the  Incomparable.    51 We have made it lawful for you to listen to music and singing. Take  heed, however, lest listening thereto should cause you to overstep the  bounds of propriety and dignity. Let your joy be the joy born of My Most  Great Name, a Name that bringeth rapture to the heart, and filleth with  ecstasy the minds of all who have drawn nigh unto God. We, verily, have  made music as a ladder for your souls, a means whereby they may be lifted  up unto the realm on high; make it not, therefore, as wings to self and  passion. Truly, We are loath to see you numbered with the foolish.    52 We have decreed that a third part of all fines shall go to the Seat of  Justice, and We admonish its men to observe pure justice, that they may  expend what is thus accumulated for such purposes as have been enjoined  upon them by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O ye Men of  Justice! Be ye, in the realm of God, shepherds unto His sheep and guard  them from the ravening wolves that have appeared in disguise, even as ye  would guard your own sons. Thus exhorteth you the Counsellor, the  Faithful.    53 Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God  while the Sun still shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it  hath set, refer ye to whatsoever hath been sent down by Him. This, verily,  is sufficient unto the peoples of the world. Say: Let not your hearts be  perturbed, O people, when the glory of My Presence is withdrawn, and the  ocean of My utterance is stilled. In My presence amongst you there is a  wisdom, and in My absence there is yet another, inscrutable to all but  God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. Verily, We behold you from Our  realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever will arise for the triumph of Our  Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on high and a company of Our  favoured angels.    54 O peoples of the earth! God, the Eternal Truth, is My witness that  streams of fresh and soft-flowing waters have gushed from the rocks  through the sweetness of the words uttered by your Lord, the  Unconstrained; and still ye slumber. Cast away that which ye possess, and,  on the wings of detachment, soar beyond all created things. Thus biddeth  you the Lord of creation, the movement of Whose Pen hath revolutionized  the soul of mankind.    55 Know ye from what heights your Lord, the All-Glorious, is calling?  Think ye that ye have recognized the Pen wherewith your Lord, the Lord of  all names, commandeth you? Nay, by My life! Did ye but know it, ye would  renounce the world, and would hasten with your whole hearts to the  presence of the Well-Beloved. Your spirits would be so transported by His  Word as to throw into commotion the Greater World--how much more this small  and petty one! Thus have the showers of My bounty been poured down from  the heaven of My loving-kindness, as a token of My grace, that ye may be  of the thankful.    56 The penalties for wounding or striking a person depend upon the  severity of the injury; for each degree the Lord of Judgement hath  prescribed a certain indemnity. He is, in truth, the Ordainer, the Mighty,  the Most Exalted. We shall, if it be Our Will, set forth these payments in  their just degrees--this is a promise on Our part, and He, verily, is the  Keeper of His pledge, the Knower of all things.    57 Verily, it is enjoined upon you to offer a feast, once in every month,  though only water be served; for God hath purposed to bind hearts  together, albeit through both earthly and heavenly means.    58 Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination  provoke divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members  of one body. Thus counselleth you the Pen of Revelation, if ye be of them  that believe.    59 Consider the mercy of God and His gifts. He enjoineth upon you that  which shall profit you, though He Himself can well dispense with all  creatures. Your evil doings can never harm Us, neither can your good works  profit Us. We summon you wholly for the sake of God. To this every man of  understanding and insight will testify.    60 If ye should hunt with beasts or birds of prey, invoke ye the Name of  God when ye send them to pursue their quarry; for then whatever they catch  shall be lawful unto you, even should ye find it to have died. He, verily,  is the Omniscient, the All-Informed. Take heed, however, that ye hunt not  to excess. Tread ye the path of justice and equity in all things. Thus  biddeth you He Who is the Dawning-place of Revelation, would that ye might  comprehend.    61 God hath bidden you to show forth kindliness towards My kindred, but He  hath granted them no right to the property of others. He, verily, is  self-sufficient, above any need of His creatures.    62 Should anyone intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye  burn; should anyone deliberately take another's life, him also shall ye  put to death. Take ye hold of the precepts of God with all your strength  and power, and abandon the ways of the ignorant. Should ye condemn the  arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment, it would be permissible  according to the provisions of the Book. He, verily, hath power to ordain  whatsoever He pleaseth.    63 God hath prescribed matrimony unto you. Beware that ye take not unto  yourselves more wives than two. Whoso contenteth himself with a single  partner from among the maidservants of God, both he and she shall live in  tranquillity. And he who would take into his service a maid may do so with  propriety. Such is the ordinance which, in truth and justice, hath been  recorded by the Pen of Revelation. Enter into wedlock, O people, that ye  may bring forth one who will make mention of Me amid My servants. This is  My bidding unto you; hold fast to it as an assistance to yourselves.    64 O people of the world! Follow not the promptings of the self, for it  summoneth insistently to wickedness and lust; follow, rather, Him Who is  the Possessor of all created things, Who biddeth you to show forth piety,  and manifest the fear of God.

The tribesmen with whom we had just made friends sat in hundreds on  the ridges watching the progress of the fight. It was no doubt a great  temptation to them to attack the 'infidels' while they were at their  mercy, and considerable anxiety was felt by Lawrence and Edwardes  as to the part which our new allies would play; their relief was  proportionate when it was found they intended to maintain a neutral  attitude.    I shall not further describe the events of that day, more especially  as I was not fortunate enough to be in time to take part in the  proceedings. I have only referred to this expedition as being typical  of many little frontier fights, and because I remember being much  impressed at the time with the danger of trusting our communications  in a difficult mountainous country to people closely allied to those  against whom we were fighting. This over-confidence in the good faith  of our frontier neighbours caused us serious embarrassments a few  years later during the Umbeyla campaign.    The force remained in camp for some time for the protection of the men  employed in building the post, which was called Fort Mackeson, after  the murdered Commissioner. When it was completed we returned to  Peshawar.      [Footnote 1: Shortly before my father left Peshawar he received  the following letter from Colonel Outram, dated Calcutta, the 23rd  October, 1853: 'As I know that your views as to the policy that should  be pursued towards Dost Mahomed must be in accordance with those of  the Governor-General, I accordingly showed your letter to Grant,  Courtney, and Colonel Low, all of whom were glad to learn that you  entertained such sound views, opposed though they be with the general  clamour for war with the Kabulese which appears to be the cry of the  army. This, together with the wise forethought you displayed before  the Kabul insurrection (which, though at the time it found no favour  at Head-Quarters, was subsequently so mournfully established by the  Kabul massacre, which would have been prevented had your warnings  been attended to), shows how well you would combine the military and  political control of the country beyond the Indus.']    [Footnote 2: The late General Sir Sydney Cotton, G.C.B.]    [Footnote 3: Now General Sir Henry Norman, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., lately  Governor of Queensland.]    [Footnote 4: Now General Sir Peter Lumsden, G.C.B.]    [Footnote 5: 1881.]    [Footnote 6:                'HERE LIES THE BODY OF FREDERICK MACKESON,      LIEUTENANT-COLONEL IN THE BENGAL ARMY, COMPANION OF THE BATH, AND     COMMISSIONER OF PESHAWAR, WHO WAS BORN SEPTEMBER 2ND, 1807, AND DIED      SEPTEMBER 14TH, 1853, OF A WOUND INFLICTED BY A RELIGIOUS FANATIC.      He was the beau-ideal of a soldier--cool to conceive, brave to dare,  and strong to do. The Indian Army was proud of his noble presence in  its ranks--not without cause. On the dark page of the Afghan war the  name of \"Mackeson\" shines brightly out; the frontier was his post, and  the future his field. The defiles of the Khyber and the peaks of the  Black Mountain alike witness his exploits. Death still found him in  front. Unconquered enemies felt safer when he fell. His own Government  thus mourn the fall.    'The reputation of Lieutenant-Colonel Mackeson as a soldier is known  to and honoured by all. His value as a political servant of the State  is known to none better than to the Governor-General himself, who in a  difficult and eventful time had cause to mark his great ability, and  the admirable prudence, discretion, and temper, which added tenfold  value to the high soldierly qualities of his public character.    'The loss of Colonel Mackeson's life would have dimmed a victory; to  lose him thus, by the hand of a foul assassin, is a misfortune of  the heaviest gloom for the Government, which counted him amongst its  bravest and best.

I travelled _via_ Murree to Abbottabad, along the route now  well known as the 'Gullies.' Here I was joined by Lieutenant George  Rodney Brown,[1] a subaltern of Horse Artillery, with whom I chummed  at Peshawar.    Abbottabad was a very small place in those days. It was named after  its first Deputy-Commissioner, James Abbott,[2] famous for his journey  _via_ Bokhara and Khiva to Russia in 1839, undertaken for the release  of Russian prisoners who were kept as slaves by the Turkomans. He had  just left, and had been succeeded as Deputy-Commissioner by a Captain  Becher, who, fortunately for us, was away in the district. I say  fortunately, because we were bent on visiting Khagan, and had obtained  permission from the Commissioner of Peshawar to do so. He had told  us to apply to Becher for assistance, but from what we heard of that  officer, it did not seem likely he would help us. Khagan was beyond  our border, and the inhabitants were said to be even more fanatical  than the rest of the frontier tribes. The Commissioner, however, had  given us leave, and as his Deputy appeared to be the kind of man  to create obstacles, we made up our minds to slip away before he  returned.    We started on the 21st May, and marched to Habibula-Ki-Ghari. Here the  road bifurcates, one branch leading to Kashmir, the other to Khagan.  We took the latter, and proceeded to Balakot, twelve miles further  on, which was then our frontier post. There we found a small guard of  Frontier Police, two of whom we induced to accompany us on our onward  journey for the purpose of assisting to look after the baggage and  collecting coolies. Three days' more marching brought us to Khagan.  The road almost the whole way from Balakot ran along a precipice  overhanging the Nainsukh river, at that time of year a rushing  torrent, owing to the melting of the snows on the higher ranges. The  track was rough, steep, and in some places very narrow. We crossed and  recrossed the river several times by means of snow-bridges, which,  spanning the limpid, jade-coloured water, had a very pretty effect. At  one point our _shikarris_[3] stopped, and proudly told us that on that  very spot their tribe had destroyed a Sikh army sent against them in  the time of Runjit Sing. It certainly was a place well chosen for a  stand, not more than fifty yards wide, with a perpendicular cliff on  one side and a roaring torrent on the other.    The people apparently did not object to our being in their country,  and treated us with much civility throughout our journey. We were  enjoying ourselves immensely, so when an official cover reached us  with the signature of the dreaded Deputy-Commissioner in the corner,  we agreed that it would be unwise to open it just then.    Khagan was almost buried in snow. The scenery was magnificent, and  became every moment more wonderful as we slowly climbed the steep  ascent in front of us; range after range of snow-capped mountains  disclosed themselves to our view, rising higher and higher into the  air, until at last, towering above all, Nanga Parbat[4] in all her  spotless beauty was revealed to our astonished and delighted gaze.    We could not get beyond Khagan. Our coolies refused to go further,  alleging as their reason the danger to be dreaded from avalanches  in that month; but I suspect that fear of hostility from the tribes  further north had more to do with their reluctance to proceed than  dread of falling avalanches. We remained at Khagan for two or  three days in the hope of being able to shoot an ibex, but we were  disappointed; we never even saw one.    We retraced our steps with considerable regret, and reached  Habibula-Ki-Ghari on the 31st May. Here we received a second official  document from Abbottabad. It contained, like the previous letter,  which we now looked at for the first time, orders for our immediate  return, and warnings that we were on no account to go to Khagan. Since  then Khagan has been more than once visited by British officers, and  now a road is in course of construction along the route we travelled,  as being a more direct line of communication with Gilghit than that  _via_ Kashmir.    We made no delay at Habibula-Ki-Ghari, but started at once for the  lovely Vale of Kashmir, where we spent the summer, amusing ourselves  by making excursions to all the places of interest and beauty we had  so often heard of, and occasionally shooting a bear. The place which  impressed me most was Martund,[5] where stand the picturesque ruins of  a once renowned Hindu temple. These noble ruins are the most striking  in size and position of all the existing remains of the past glories  of Kashmir.    From Martund we made our way to Vernag, the celebrated spring which  is supposed to be the source of the Jhelum river. The Moghul Emperor  Akbar built there a summer palace, and the arches, on which it is  said rested the private apartments of the lovely Nur Jehan, are still  visible.    We wandered over the beautiful and fertile Lolab valley, and pitched  our little camp in the midst of groves of chunar, walnut, apple,  cherry, and peach trees; and we marched up the Sind valley, and  crossed the Zojji La Pass leading into Thibet. The scenery all along  this route is extremely grand. On either side are lofty mountains,  their peaks wrapped in snow, their sides clothed with pine, and their  feet covered with forests, in which is to be found almost every kind  of deciduous tree.
