I shall hope to  profit by your mistakes, too. That is one reason I wanted to see this  test.\"    \"Then you are seriously determined to make a gun that you think will  rival mine.\"    \"I am, General Waller.\"    \"For what purpose--to sell to some foreign government?\"    \"No, sir!\" cried Tom, with flashing eyes. \"If I am successful in making  a cannon that will fire the longest shots on record, I shall offer it  to Uncle Sam first of all. If he does not want it, I shall not dispose  of it to any foreign country!\"    \"Hum! Well, I don't believe you'll succeed. I intend to rebuild my gun  at once, though I may make some changes in it. I am sure I shall  succeed the next time. But as for you--a mere youth--to hope to rival  men who have made this problem a life-study--it is preposterous, sir!  Utterly preposterous!\" and he uttered these words much as he had  declared that it was impossible for his gun to burst, even after it was  in fragments.    \"Come on, Ned,\" said Tom, in a low voice. \"We'll go back home.\"          CHAPTER IX    THE NEW POWDER      \"Bless my cartridge belt, Tom, you don't really mean to say that stuff  is powder!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.    \"That's what I hope it will prove to be--and powerful powder at that.\"    \"Why, it looks more like excelsior than anything else,\" went on the odd  man, gingerly taking up some yellowish shreds in his fingers.    \"And it will burn as harmlessly as excelsior in the open air,\" went on  Tom. \"But I hope to prove, when it is confined in a chamber, that it  will be highly explosive. I'm going to make a test of it soon.\"    \"Give me good notice, so I can get over in the next State!\" exclaimed  Ned Newton, with a laugh.    This was several days after our friends had returned from the  disastrous gun test at Sandy Hook. Tom had at once gotten to work on  the problem that confronted him--a problem of his own making--to build  a giant cannon that would make the longest shots on record. And he had  first turned his attention to the powder, or explosive, to be used.    \"For,\" he said, \"there is no use having a big gun unless you can fire  it. And the gun I am planning will need something more powerful in the  powder line than any I've ever heard of.\"    \"Stronger than the kind General Waller used?\" inquired Ned.    \"Yes, but I'll make my cannon correspondingly stronger, too, so there  will be no danger.\"    \"Bless my shoe buttons!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"You boys must have had  your nerve with you to stay around Sandy Hook after that gun went up in  the air.\"    \"Oh, the danger was all over soon after it began,\" spoke Tom, with a  smile. \"But now I'm going to test some of this powder. If you want to  run away, Mr. Damon, I'll have Koku take you up in one of the airships,  and you'll certainly be safe a mile or so in the air,\" for Tom had  instructed his giant servant how to run one of the simpler biplanes.    \"No--no, Tom, I'll stick!\" exclaimed the eccentric man. \"I'll not  promise not to hide behind the fence, or something like that, though,  Tom; but I'll stick.\"    \"So will I,\" added Ned. \"How are you going to make the test, Tom?\"    \"I'll tell you in a minute. I want to do a little figuring first.\"    Tom had, before going to Sandy Hook, made some experiments in powder  manufacturing, but they had not been very satisfactory. He had not been  able to get power enough. On his return he had undertaken rather a  daring innovation. He had mingled two varieties of powder, and the  resulting combination would, he hoped, prove just what he wanted.    The powder was in gelatin form, being made with nitro-glycerine as a  base. It looked, as Mr. Damon had said, like a bunch of excelsior, only  it was yellow instead of white, and it felt not unlike pieces of dry  macaroni.    \"I have shredded the powder in this manner,\" Tom explained, \"so that it  will explode more evenly and quickly. I want it to burn as nearly  instantaneously as possible, and I think it will in this form.\"    \"But how are you going to tell how powerful it is unless you fire it in  a cannon?\" asked Ned. \"And you haven't even started your big gun yet.\"    \"Oh, I'll show you,\" declared Tom. \"There are several ways of making a  test, but I have one of my own. I am going to take a solid block of  steel, of known weight--say about a hundred pounds. This I will put  into a sort of square cylinder, or well, closed at the bottom somewhat  like the breech of a gun. The block of steel fits so closely in the  square well that no air or powder gas can pass it.    \"In the bottom of this well, which may be a foot square, I will put a  small charge of this new powder. On top of that will come the steel  block. Then by means of electric wires I can fire the charge.    \"Attached to the steel well, or chamber, will be a gauge, a pressure  recorder and other apparatus. When the powder, of which I will use only  a pinch, carefully weighing it, goes off, it will raise the  hundred-pound weight a certain distance. This will be noted on the  scale. There will also be shown the amount of pressure released in the  gas given off by the powder. In that way I can make some calculations.\"    \"How?\" asked Ned, who was much interested.    \"Well, for instance, if one ounce of powder raises the weight three  feet, and gives a muzzle pressure of, say, five hundred pounds, I can  easily compute what a thousand pounds of powder, acting on a projectile  weighing two tons and a half, would do, and how far it would shoot it.\"    \"Bless my differential gear!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"A projectile weighing  two and a half, tons! Tom, it's impossible!\"    \"That's what General Waller said about his gun; but it burst, just the  same,\" declared Ned. \"Poor man, I felt sorry for him. He seemed rather  put out at you, Tom.\"    \"I guess he was--a bit--though I didn't mean anything disrespectful in  what I said. But now we'll have this test. Koku, take the rest of this  powder back. I'll only keep a small quantity.\"    The giant, who, being more active than Eradicate, had rather supplanted  the aged colored man, did as he was bid, and soon Tom, with Ned and Mr.  Damon to help him, was preparing for the test.    They went some distance away from any of the buildings, for, though Tom  was only going to use a small quantity of the explosive, he did not  just know what the result would be, and he wanted to take no chances.    \"I know from personal experience what the two kinds of powder from  which I made this sample will do,\" he said; \"but it is like taking two  known quantities and getting a third unknown one from them. There is an  unequal force between the two samples that may make an entirely new  compound.\"    The steel chamber that was to receive the hundred-pound steel block had  been prepared in advance, as had the various gauges and registering  apparatus.    \"Well, I guess we'll start things moving now,\" went on Tom, as he  looked over the things he had brought from his shops to the deserted  meadow. The fact of the test had been kept a secret, so there were no  spectators. \"Ned, give me a hand with this block,\" Tom went on. \"It's a  little too heavy to lift alone.\" He was straining and tugging at the  heavy piece of steel.    \"Me do!\" exclaimed Koku the giant, gently pushing Tom to one side. Then  the big man, with one hand, raised the hundred-pound weight as easily  as if it were a loaf of bread, and deposited it where Tom wanted it.    \"Thanks!\" exclaimed our hero, with a laugh. \"I didn't make any mistake  when I brought you home with me, Koku.\"    \"Huh! I could hab lifted dat weight when I was a young feller!\"  exclaimed Eradicate, who was, it is needless to say, jealous of the  giant.    The powder had been put in the firing chamber. The steel socket had  been firmly fixed in the earth, so that if the force of the explosion  was in a lateral direction, instead of straight up, no damage would  result. The weight, even if it shot from the muzzle of the improvised  \"cannon,\" would only go harmlessly up in the air, and then drop back.  The firing wires were so long that Tom and his friends could stand some  distance away.    \"Are you all ready?\" cried Tom, as he looked to see that the wiring was  clear.    \"As ready as we ever shall be,\" replied Mr. Damon, who, with Ned and  the others, had taken refuge behind a low hill.    \"Oh, this isn't going to be much of an explosion,\" laughed Tom.  \"It  won't be any worse than a Fourth of July cannon. Here she goes!\"    He pressed the electric button, there was a flash, a dull, muffled  report and, for a moment, something black showed at the top of the  steel chamber. Then it dropped back inside again.    \"Pshaw!\" cried Tom, in disappointed tones. \"It didn't even blow the  weight out of the tube. That powder's no good! It's a failure!\"    Followed by the others, the young inventor started toward the small  square \"cannon.\" Tom wanted to read the records made by the gases.    Suddenly Koku cried:    \"There him be, master! There him be!\" and he pointed toward a distant  path that traversed the meadow.    \"He? Whom do you mean?\" asked Tom, startled the giant's excited manner.    \"That man what come and look at Master's new powder,\" was the  unexpected answer. \"Him say he want to surprise you, and he come today,  but no speak. He run away. Look--him go!\" and he pointed toward a  figure of distinctly military bearing hurrying along the road that led  to Shopton.          CHAPTER X    SOMETHING WRONG      \"Bless my buttons!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"Let's chase after him!\" yelled Ned.    \"Koku kin run de fastest oh any oh us,\" put in Eradicate. \"Let him go.\"    \"Hold on--wait a minute!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We want to know who that man  is--and why we're going to chase after him. Koku, I guess it's up to  you. Something has been going on here that I don't know anything about.  Explain!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"woman,\" says Dr. Matignon, \"resides      largely in her foot. 'A foot which is not deformed is a      dishonor,' says a poet. For the husband the foot is more      interesting than the face. Only the husband may see his wife's      foot naked. A Chinese woman is as reticent in showing her feet to      a man as a European woman her breasts. I have often had to treat      Chinese women with ridiculously small feet for wounds and      excoriations, the result of tight-bandaging. They exhibited the      prudishness of school-girls, blushed, turned their backs to      unfasten the bandages, and then concealed the foot in a cloth,      leaving only the affected part uncovered. Modesty is a question      of convention; Chinese have it for their feet,\" (J. Matignon, \"A      propos d'un Pied de Chinoise,\" _Archives d'Anthropologie      Criminelle_, 1898, p. 445.)        Among the Yakuts of Northeast Siberia, \"there was a well-known      custom according to which a bride should avoid showing herself or      her uncovered body to her father-in-law. In ancient times, they      say, a bride concealed herself for seven years from her      father-in-law, and from the brothers and other masculine      relations of her husband.... The men also tried not to meet her,      saying, 'The poor child will be ashamed.' If a meeting could not      be avoided the young woman put a mask on her face.... Nowadays,      the young wives only avoid showing to their male relatives-in-law      the uncovered body. Amongst the rich they avoid going about in      the presence of these in the chemise alone. In some places, they      lay especial emphasis on the fact that it is a shame for young      wives to show their uncovered hair and feet to the male relatives      of their husbands. On the other side, the male relatives of the      husband ought to avoid showing to the young wife the body      uncovered above the elbow or the sole of the foot, and they ought      to avoid indecent expressions and vulgar vituperations in her      presence.... That these observances are not the result of a      specially delicate modesty, is proved by the fact that even young      girls constantly twist thread upon the naked thigh, unembarrassed      by the presence of men who do not belong to the household; nor do      they show any embarrassment if a strange man comes upon them when      uncovered to the waist. The one thing which they do not like, and      at which they show anger, is that such persons look carefully at      their uncovered feet.... The former simplicity, with lack of      shame in uncovering the body, is disappearing.\" (Sieroshevski,      \"The Yakuts,\" _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_,      Jan.-June, 1901, p. 93.)        \"In Japan (Captain ---- tells me), the bathing-place of the women      was perfectly open (the shampooing, indeed, was done by a man),      and Englishmen were offered no obstacle, nor excited the least      repugnance; indeed, girls after their bath would freely pass,      sometimes as if holding out their hair for innocent admiration,      and this continued until countrymen of ours, by vile laughter and      jests, made them guard themselves from insult by secrecy. So      corruption spreads, and heathenism is blacker by our contact.\"      (Private communication.)        \"Speaking once with a Japanese gentleman, I observed that we      considered it an act of indecency for men and women to wash      together. He shrugged his shoulders as he answered: 'But these      Westerns have such prurient minds!'\" (Mitford, _Tales of Old      Japan_, 1871.)        Dr. Carl Davidsohn, who remarks that he had ample opportunity of      noting the great beauty of the Japanese women in a national      dance, performed naked, points out that the Japanese have no      aesthetic sense for the nude. \"This was shown at the Jubilee      Exposition at Kyoto. Here, among many rooms full of art objects,      one was devoted to oil pictures in the European manner. Among      these only one represented a nude figure, a Psyche, or Truth. It      was the first time such a picture had been seen. Men and women      crowded around it. After they had gazed at it for a time, most      began to giggle and laugh; some by their air and gestures clearly      showed their disgust; all found that it was not aesthetic to paint      a naked woman, though in Nature, nakedness was in no way      offensive to them. In the middle of the same city, at a fountain      reputed to possess special virtues, men and women will stand      together naked and let the water run over them.\" (Carl      Davidsohn, \"Das Nackte bei den Japanern,\" _Globus_, 1896, No.      16.)        \"It is very difficult to investigate the hairiness of Ainu      women,\" Baelz remarks, \"for they possess a really incredible      degree of modesty. Even when in summer they bathe--which happens      but seldom--they keep their clothes on.\" He records that he was      once asked to examine a girl at the Mission School, in order to      advise as regards the treatment of a diseased spine; although she      had been at the school for seven years, she declared that \"she      would rather die than show her back to a man, even though a      doctor.\" (Baelz, \"Die Aino,\" _Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1901,      Heft 2, p. 178.)        The Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, appear to have been accustomed      to cover the foreskin with the _kynodesme_ (a band), or the      _fibula_ (a ring), for custom and modesty demanded that the glans      should be concealed. Such covering is represented in persons who      were compelled to be naked, and is referred to by Celsus as      \"decori causa.\" (L. Stieda, \"Anatomisch-archaeologische Studien,\"      _Anatomische Hefte_, Bd. XIX, Heft 2, 1902.)        \"Among the Lydians, and, indeed, among the barbarians generally,      it is considered a deep disgrace, even for a man, to be seen      naked.\" (Herodotus, Book I, Chapter X.)        \"The simple dress which is now common was first worn in Sparta,      and there, more than anywhere else, the life of the rich was      assimilated to that of the people. The Lacedaemonians, too, were      the first who, in their athletic exercises, stripped naked and      rubbed themselves over with oil. This was not the ancient custom;      athletes formerly, even when they were contending at Olympia,      wore girdles about their loins [earlier still, the Mycenaeans had      always worn a loin-cloth], a practice which lasted until quite      lately, and still persists among barbarians, especially those of      Asia, where the combatants at boxing and wrestling matches wear      girdles.\" (Thucydides, _History_, Book I, Chapter VI.)        \"The notion of the women exercising naked in the schools with the      men ... at the present day would appear truly ridiculous.... Not      long since it was thought discreditable and ridiculous among the      Greeks, as it is now among most barbarous nations, for men to be      seen naked. And when the Cretans first, and after them the      Lacedaemonians, began the practice of gymnastic exercises, the      wits of the time had it in their power to make sport of those      novelties.... As for the man who laughs at the idea of undressed      women going through gymnastic exercises, as a means of revealing      what is most perfect, his ridicule is but 'unripe fruit plucked      from the tree of wisdom.'\" (Plato, _Republic_, Book V.)        According to Plutarch, however, among the Spartans, at all      events, nakedness in women was not ridiculous, since the      institutes of Lycurgus ordained that at solemn feasts and      sacrifices the young women should dance naked and sing, the young      men standing around in a circle to see and hear them. Aristotle      says that in his time Spartan girls only wore a very slight      garment. As described by Pausanias, and as shown by a statue in      the Vatican, the ordinary tunic, which was the sole garment worn      by women when running, left bare the right shoulder and breast,      and only reached to the upper third of the thighs. (M.M. Evans,      _Chapters on Greek Dress_, p. 34.)        Among the Greeks who were inclined to accept the doctrines of      Cynicism, it was held that, while shame is not unreasonable, what      is good may be done and discussed before all men. There are a      number of authorities who say that Crates and Hipparchia      consummated their marriage in the presence of many spectators.      Lactantius (_Inst._ iii, 15) says that the practice was common,      but this Zeller is inclined to doubt. (Zeller, _Socrates and the      Socratic Schools_, translated from the Third German Edition,      1897.)        \"Among the Tyrrhenians, who carry their luxury to an      extraordinary pitch, Timaeus, in his first book, relates that the      female servants wait on the men in a state of nudity. And      Theopompus, in the forty-third book of his _History_, states that      it is a law among the Tyrrhenians that all their women should be      in common; and that the women pay the greatest attention to their      persons, and often practice gymnastic exercises, naked, among the      men, and sometimes with one another; for that it is not accounted      shameful for them to be seen naked.... Nor is it reckoned among      the Tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do or suffer      anything in the open air, or to be seen while it is going on; for      it is quite the custom of their country, and they are so far from      thinking it disgraceful that they even say, when the master of      the house is indulging his appetite, and anyone asks for him,      that he is doing so and so, using the coarsest possible words....      And they are very beautiful, as is natural for people to be who      live delicately, and who take care of their persons.\" (Athenaeus,      _Deipnosophists_, Yonge's translation, vol. iii, p. 829.)"]]]
