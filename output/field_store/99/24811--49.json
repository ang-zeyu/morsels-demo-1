The broad fields have been shorn  of their golden grain, and men and women are still busy gathering  it in. The binders have tied the wheat in sheaves with withes, the  sheaves are piled upon a wagon and carried to a place near the farm  buildings, where they are stacked in great mounds resembling enormous  soup tureens. The overseer rides to and fro on his horse giving orders  to the laborers.    Now come the gleaners into the field to claim the time-honored  privilege of gathering up the scattered ears still lying on the  ground. The custom dates back to very early times.[1] The ancient  Hebrews had a strict religious law in regard to it: \"When ye reap  the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the  corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any  gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to  the stranger.\"[2] Another law says that the gleanings are \"for the  fatherless and for the widow; that the Lord thy God may bless thee in  all the work of thine hands.\"[3]    This generous practice is still observed in France. The owner of a  grain field would be afraid of bad luck to the harvest if he should  refuse to let the gleaners in after the reapers. Gleaning is, however,  allowed only in broad daylight, that no dishonest persons may carry  away entire sheaves.    It is near noon of a summer day, and the sun is high in the heavens,  casting only small shadows about the feet. The gleaners are three  women of the poorer peasant class. They are tidily dressed in their  coarse working clothes, and wear kerchiefs tied over their heads, with  the edge projecting a little over the forehead to shade the eyes. The  dresses are cut rather low in the neck, for theirs is warm work.    They make their way through the coarse stubble, as sharp as needles,  gathering here and there a stray ear of the precious wheat. Already  they have collected enough to make several little bundles, tied  neatly, and piled together on the ground at one side.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE GLEANERS]    As we look at them closely we see that they represent the three ages  of womanhood: there is a maiden, a matron, and an old woman. The  nearest figure, standing at the right, is the eldest of the three. She  cannot bear the strain of stooping long at a time, and bends stiffly  and painfully to her task. Next her is a solidly built woman, with  square figure and a broad back capable of bearing heavy burdens. Those  strong large hands have done hard work. The third figure is that of  a young woman with a lithe, girlish form. With a girl's thought for  appearance she has pinned her kerchief so that the ends at the back  form a little cape to shield her neck from the burning sun. Unlike  her companions, she wears no apron. While the others use their aprons  doubled up to form sacks for their gleanings, she holds her grain in  her hand.    If you will try in turn each one of the positions taken by the several  figures, you will see how differently the three work. The two who put  the grain in the apron, or pass it into the hand which rests on the  knee, must every time lift themselves up with an awkward backward  motion. The younger gleaner has found a short and direct route from  one hand to the other, by resting the left hand, palm up, upon the  back, where the right can reach it by a simple upward motion of the  arm which requires no exertion of the body. Her method saves the  strength and is more graceful.    Moving forward in the stooping posture, with eyes fixed upon the  ground, the figures of the gleaners have been compared to great  grasshoppers, making their odd, irregular, hopping progress across the  field. Even as we look they seem to move toward us.    The picture is a fine study in lines. The middle figure is constructed  in a square outline, and this square effect is emphasized in various  ways,--by the right angle formed between the line across the bust and  the right arm, by the square corner between chin and neck, and by the  square shape of the kerchief at the back of the head. We thus get an  idea of the solid, prosaic character of the woman herself.    The younger woman is a creature of beautiful curves. The lines of her  back and bust flow together in an oval figure which the position of  the left arm completes. The outstretched right arm continues the fine  line across the back. The lovely curve of the throat, the shapeliness  of the hand, even the pretty adjustment of the kerchief, lend added  touches to the charm of the youthful figure.    The lines of the standing figure curve towards the other two, and  carry the composition to sufficient height. The lines enclosing the  entire group form a mound-like figure not unlike a wheat stack in  shape. A wheat stack faintly seen across the distance in the centre of  the field marks the apex of the mound, the sides being formed by the  outer lines of the two outer figures.    When we compare the picture with the others we have seen in the same  general style of composition, showing a level plain with figures in  front, we note how much more detail the background of the Gleaners  contains. This is because the figures do not come above the horizon  line, as do those in the Angelus and Shepherdess. Hence the eye must  be led upward by minor objects, to take in the entire panorama spread  before us.      [Footnote 1: See the Book of Ruth.]    [Footnote 2: Leviticus, chapter xxiii., verse 22.]    [Footnote 3: Deuteronomy, chapter xxiv., verse 19.]          XIII    THE MILKMAID[1]      All through the years of Millet's life and work in Barbizon, his  thoughts used to turn often to the little village in Normandy where  he spent his youth. His early life in the fields impressed upon his  memory all the out-of-door sights peculiar to his native province. The  customs of peasants in France differ in the various provinces just  as do ours in the various states. Some of the household utensils in  Millet's childhood's home were such as he never saw elsewhere,  and always remembered with pleasure. The ways of doing the work in  Greville were not altogether like the ways of Barbizon, and Millet's  observant eye and retentive memory noted these differences with  interest. When he revisited his home in later life, he made careful  sketches of some of the jugs and kitchen utensils used in the family.  He even carried off to his Barbizon studio one particular brass jar  which was used when the girl went to the field to milk cows. He also  sketched a girl carrying a jug of milk on her shoulder in the  fashion of the place. Out of such studies was made our picture of the  Milkmaid. \"Women in my country carry jars of milk in that way,\" said  the painter when explaining the picture to a visitor at his studio,  and went on to tell of other features of the life in Normandy, which  he reproduced in his pictures, though some of them he had not seen in  all the long time since his boyhood. As a reminiscence of Normandy the  Milkmaid is a companion piece to the Sower. There are other points of  resemblance between the two pictures, as we shall see.    The day draws to its close in splendor, and the western sky is all  aflame. Against this brilliant background the figure of the Milkmaid  looms up grandly as she advances along the path through the meadow.  She is returning from the field which lies on the other slope of the  hill. There the cows are pastured and a rude fence marks the boundary.  The girl has been out for the milking, and a cow near the fence turns  its head in the direction of her retreating figure.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co, John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE MILKMAID]    The milk is carried in a large jar on the left shoulder. By holding  the left arm akimbo, hand resting on the hip, the girl makes her  shoulder a little broader, as it were, enlarging the support of the  jar. The way in which the burden is kept in place is very interesting.  To put up the right arm to steady it would be impossible, for the arm  is not long enough to insure a firm grasp upon so heavy a weight. So  a cord or strap is passed through the handle of the jar, carried over  the head, and held in the right hand. The strong arm is stretched  tense to keep the strap tight. The head must of course be protected  from the straining of the cord, the shoulder from the pressure of  the jar. Both are therefore well padded. The head pad resembles a cap  hanging in lappets on each side. Even with this protection the girl's  face shows the strain.    A picture like this teaches us that there are other ways of giving  a figure beauty than by making the face pretty. Just as Millet's  Shepherdess differs altogether from the little Bopeep of the nursery  tale, so this peasant girl is not at all like the pretty milkmaids  who carry milking-stools and shining pails through the pages of the  picture books. Millet had no patience with such pictures. Pretty girls  were not fit for hard work, he said, and he always wanted to have the  people he painted look as if they belonged to their station. Fitness  was in his mind one of the chief elements of beauty.    So he shows us in this Milkmaid a young woman framed in the massive  proportions of an Amazon, and eminently fitted for her lot in life.  Her chief beauty lies in the expression of her splendidly developed  figure. Her choicest gifts are the health and virtue which most abound  in the free life of God's country.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#9)"],[1,"Clifford, as \"Jay-bird Charley\"--an unhallowed inspiration  of the moment that clung to him ever after.    But to return to Tennessee's Partner, whom we never knew by any other  than this relative title; that he had ever existed as a separate and  distinct individuality we only learned later. It seems that in 1853 he  left Poker Flat to go to San Francisco, ostensibly to procure a wife. He  never got any farther than Stockton. At that place he was attracted by  a young person who waited upon the table at the hotel where he took his  meals. One morning he said something to her which caused her to smile  not unkindly, to somewhat coquettishly break a plate of toast over  his upturned, serious, simple face, and to retreat to the kitchen. He  followed her, and emerged a few moments later, covered with more toast  and victory. That day week they were married by a justice of the peace,  and returned to Poker Flat. I am aware that something more might be  made of this episode, but I prefer to tell it as it was current at Sandy  Bar--in the gulches and barrooms--where all sentiment was modified by a  strong sense of humor.    Of their married felicity but little is known, perhaps for the reason  that Tennessee, then living with his Partner, one day took occasion to  say something to the bride on his own account, at which, it is said,  she smiled not unkindly and chastely retreated--this time as far  as Marysville, where Tennessee followed her, and where they went to  housekeeping without the aid of a justice of the peace. Tennessee's  Partner took the loss of his wife simply and seriously, as was his  fashion. But to everybody's surprise, when Tennessee one day returned  from Marysville, without his Partner's wife--she having smiled and  retreated with somebody else--Tennessee's Partner was the first man to  shake his hand and greet him with affection. The boys who had gathered  in the canyon to see the shooting were naturally indignant. Their  indignation might have found vent in sarcasm but for a certain look  in Tennessee's Partner's eye that indicated a lack of humorous  appreciation. In fact, he was a grave man, with a steady application to  practical detail which was unpleasant in a difficulty.    Meanwhile a popular feeling against Tennessee had grown up on the Bar.  He was known to be a gambler; he was suspected to be a thief. In these  suspicions Tennessee's Partner was equally compromised; his continued  intimacy with Tennessee after the affair above quoted could only be  accounted for on the hypothesis of a copartnership of crime. At last  Tennessee's guilt became flagrant. One day he overtook a stranger on his  way to Red Dog. The stranger afterward related that Tennessee beguiled  the time with interesting anecdote and reminiscence, but illogically  concluded the interview in the following words: \"And now, young man,  I'll trouble you for your knife, your pistols, and your money. You see  your weppings might get you into trouble at Red Dog, and your money's a  temptation to the evilly disposed. I think you said your address was  San Francisco. I shall endeavor to call.\" It may be stated here that  Tennessee had a fine flow of humor, which no business preoccupation  could wholly subdue.    This exploit was his last. Red Dog and Sandy Bar made common cause  against the highwayman. Tennessee was hunted in very much the same  fashion as his prototype, the grizzly. As the toils closed around him,  he made a desperate dash through the Bar, emptying his revolver at the  crowd before the Arcade Saloon, and so on up Grizzly Canyon; but at its  farther extremity he was stopped by a small man on a gray horse. The  men looked at each other a moment in silence. Both were fearless, both  self-possessed and independent; and both types of a civilization that  in the seventeenth century would have been called heroic, but, in the  nineteenth, simply \"reckless.\" \"What have you got there?--I call,\"  said Tennessee, quietly. \"Two bowers and an ace,\" said the stranger,  as quietly, showing two revolvers and a bowie knife. \"That takes me,\"  returned Tennessee; and with this gamblers' epigram, he threw away his  useless pistol, and rode back with his captor.      It was a warm night. The cool breeze which usually sprang up with the  going down of the sun behind the chaparral-crested mountain was that  evening withheld from Sandy Bar. The little canyon was stifling with  heated resinous odors, and the decaying driftwood on the Bar sent forth  faint, sickening exhalations. The feverishness of day, and its fierce  passions, still filled the camp. Lights moved restlessly along the bank  of the river, striking no answering reflection from its tawny current.  Against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft above the  express office stood out staringly bright; and through their curtainless  panes the loungers below could see the forms of those who were even then  deciding the fate of Tennessee. And above all this, etched on the dark  firmament, rose the Sierra, remote and passionless, crowned with remoter  passionless stars.    The trial of Tennessee was conducted as fairly as was consistent with a  judge and jury who felt themselves to some extent obliged to justify, in  their verdict, the previous irregularities of arrest and indictment. The  law of Sandy Bar was implacable, but not vengeful. The excitement and  personal feeling of the chase were over; with Tennessee safe in their  hands they were ready to listen patiently to any defense, which they  were already satisfied was insufficient. There being no doubt in their  own minds, they were willing to give the prisoner the benefit of any  that might exist. Secure in the hypothesis that he ought to be hanged,  on general principles, they indulged him with more latitude of defense  than his reckless hardihood seemed to ask. The Judge appeared to be more  anxious than the prisoner, who, otherwise unconcerned, evidently took  a grim pleasure in the responsibility he had created. \"I don't take any  hand in this yer game,\" had been his invariable but good-humored reply  to all questions. The Judge--who was also his captor--for a moment  vaguely regretted that he had not shot him \"on sight\" that morning,  but presently dismissed this human weakness as unworthy of the judicial  mind. Nevertheless, when there was a tap at the door, and it was said  that Tennessee's Partner was there on behalf of the prisoner, he was  admitted at once without question. Perhaps the younger members of the  jury, to whom the proceedings were becoming irksomely thoughtful, hailed  him as a relief.    For he was not, certainly, an imposing figure. Short and stout, with a  square face sunburned into a preternatural redness, clad in a loose duck  \"jumper\" and trousers streaked and splashed with red soil, his aspect  under any circumstances would have been quaint, and was now even  ridiculous. As he stooped to deposit at his feet a heavy carpetbag he  was carrying, it became obvious, from partially developed legends and  inscriptions, that the material with which his trousers had been patched  had been originally intended for a less ambitious covering. Yet he  advanced with great gravity, and after having shaken the hand of each  person in the room with labored cordiality, he wiped his serious,  perplexed face on a red bandanna handkerchief, a shade lighter than his  complexion, laid his powerful hand upon the table to steady himself, and  thus addressed the Judge:    \"I was passin' by,\" he began, by way of apology, \"and I thought I'd  just step in and see how things was gittin' on with Tennessee thar--my  pardner. It's a hot night. I disremember any sich weather before on the  Bar.\"    He paused a moment, but nobody volunteering any other meteorological  recollection, he again had recourse to his pocket handkerchief, and for  some moments mopped his face diligently.    \"Have you anything to say in behalf of the prisoner?\" said the Judge,  finally.    \"Thet's it,\" said Tennessee's Partner, in a tone of relief. \"I come yar  as Tennessee's pardner--knowing him nigh on four year, off and on, wet  and dry, in luck and out o' luck. His ways ain't allers my ways, but  thar ain't any p'ints in that young man, thar ain't any liveliness  as he's been up to, as I don't know. And you sez to me, sez  you--confidential-like, and between man and man--sez you, 'Do you know  anything in his behalf?' and I sez to you, sez I--confidential-like, as  between man and man--'What should a man know of his pardner?'\"    \"Is this all you have to say?\" asked the Judge impatiently, feeling,  perhaps, that a dangerous sympathy of humor was beginning to humanize  the Court.    \"Thet's so,\" continued Tennessee's Partner. \"It ain't for me to say  anything agin' him. And now, what's the case? Here's Tennessee wants  money, wants it bad, and doesn't like to ask it of his old pardner.  Well, what does Tennessee do? He lays for a stranger, and he fetches  that stranger. And you lays for HIM, and you fetches HIM; and the  honors is easy. And I put it to you, bein' a far-minded man, and to you,  gentlemen, all, as far-minded men, ef this isn't so.\"    \"Prisoner,\" said the Judge, interrupting, \"have you any questions to ask  this man?\"    \"No! no!\" continued Tennessee's Partner, hastily. \"I play this yer hand  alone. To come down to the bedrock, it's just this: Tennessee, thar, has  played it pretty rough and expensive-like on a stranger, and on this yer  camp. And now, what's the fair thing? Some would say more; some  would say less. Here's seventeen hundred dollars in coarse gold and a  watch--it's about all my pile--and call it square!\" And before a hand  could be raised to prevent him, he had emptied the contents of the  carpetbag upon the table.    For a moment his life was in jeopardy. One or two men sprang to their  feet, several hands groped for hidden weapons, and a suggestion to  \"throw him from the window\" was only"]]]
