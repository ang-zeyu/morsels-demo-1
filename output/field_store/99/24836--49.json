When living on a farm      I have ascertained that cows sometimes, though not frequently,      exhibit slight signs of sexual excitement, with secretion of      mucus, while being milked; so that, as the dairymaid herself      observed, it is as if they were being \"bulled.\" The sow, like      some other mammals, often eats her own young after birth,      mistaking them, it is thought, for the placenta, which is      normally eaten by most mammals; it is said that the sow never      eats her young when they have once taken the teat.        It occasionally happens that this normal tendency for suckling to      produce voluptuous sexual emotions is present in an extreme      degree, and may lead to sexual perversions. It does not appear      that the sexual sensations aroused by suckling usually culminate      in the orgasm; this however, was noted in a case recorded by      Fere, of a slightly neurotic woman in whom intense sexual      excitement occurred during suckling, especially if prolonged; so      far as possible, she shortened the periods of suckling in order      to prevent, not always successfully, the occurrence of the orgasm      (Fere, _Archives de Neurologie_ No. 30, 1903). Icard refers to      the case of a woman who sought to become pregnant solely for the      sake of the voluptuous sensations she derived from suckling, and      Yellowlees (Art. \"Masturbation,\" _Dictionary of Psychological      Medicine_) speaks of the overwhelming character of \"the storms of      sexual feeling sometimes observed during lactation.\"        It may be remarked that the frequency of the association between      lactation and the sexual sensations is indicated by the fact      that, as Savage remarks, lactational insanity is often      accompanied by fancies regarding the reproductive organs.    When we have realized the special sensitivity of the orificial regions and  the peculiarly close relationships between the breasts and the sexual  organs we may easily understand the considerable part which they normally  play in the art of love. As one of the chief secondary sexual characters  in women, and one of her chief beauties, a woman's breasts offer  themselves to the lover's lips with a less intimate attraction than her  mouth only because the mouth is better able to respond. On her side, such  contact is often instinctively desired. Just as the sexual disturbance of  pregnancy is accompanied by a sympathetic disturbance in the breasts, so  the sexual excitement produced by the lover's proximity reacts on the  breasts; the nipple becomes turgid and erect in sympathy with the  clitoris; the woman craves to place her lover in the place of the child,  and experiences a sensation in which these two supreme objects of her  desire are deliciously mingled.        The powerful effect which stimulation of the nipple produces on      the sexual sphere has led to the breasts playing a prominent part      in the erotic art of those lands in which this art has been most      carefully cultivated. Thus in India, according to Vatsyayana,      many authors are of the opinion that in approaching a woman a      lover should begin by sucking the nipples of her breasts, and in      the songs of the Bayaderes of Southern India sucking the nipple      is mentioned as one of the natural preliminaries of coitus.        In some cases, and more especially in neurotic persons, the      sexual pleasure derived from manipulation of the nipple passes      normal limits and, being preferred even to coitus, becomes a      perversion. In girls' schools, it is said, especially in France,      sucking and titillation of the breasts are not uncommon; in men,      also, titillation of the nipples occasionally produces sexual      sensations (Fere, _L'Instinct Sexuel_, second edition, p. 132).      Hildebrandt recorded the case of a young woman whose nipples had      been sucked by her lover; by constantly drawing her breasts she      became able to suck them herself and thus attained extreme sexual      pleasure. A.J. Bloch, of New Orleans, has noted the case of a      woman who complained of swelling of the breasts; the gentlest      manipulation produced an orgasm, and it was found that the      swelling had been intentionally produced for the sake of this      manipulation. Moraglia in Italy knew a very beautiful woman who      was perfectly cold in normal sexual relationships, but madly      excited when her husband pressed or sucked her breasts. Lombroso      (_Archivio di Psichiatria_, 1885, fasc. IV) has described the      somewhat similar case of a woman who had no sexual sensitivity in      the clitoris, vagina, or labia, and no pleasure in coitus except      in very strange positions, but possessed intense sexual feelings      in the right nipple as well as in the upper third of the thigh.        It is remarkable that not only is suckling apt to be accompanied      by sexual pleasure in the mother, but that, in some cases, the      infant also appears to have a somewhat similar experience. This      is, at all events, indicated in a remarkable case recorded by      Fere (_L'Instinct Sexuel_, second edition, p. 257). A female      infant child of slightly neurotic heredity was weaned at the age      of 14 months, but so great was her affection for her mother's      breasts, though she had already become accustomed to other food,      that this was only accomplished with great difficulty and by      allowing her still to caress the naked breasts several times a      day. This went on for many months, when the mother, becoming      again pregnant, insisted on putting an end to it. So jealous was      the child, however, that it was necessary to conceal from her the      fact that her younger sister was suckled at her mother's breasts,      and once at the age of 3, when she saw her father aiding her      mother to undress, she became violently jealous of him. This      jealousy, as well as the passion for her mother's breasts,      persisted to the age of puberty, though she learned to conceal      it. At the age of 13, when menstruation began, she noticed in      dancing with her favorite girl friends that when her breasts came      in contact with theirs she experienced a very agreeable      sensation, with erection of the nipples; but it was not till the      age of 16 that she observed that the sexual region took part in      this excitement and became moist. From this period she had erotic      dreams about young girls. She never experienced any attraction      for young men, but eventually married; though having much esteem      and affection for her husband, she never felt any but the      slightest sexual enjoyment in his arms, and then only by evoking      feminine images. This case, in which the sensations of an infant      at the breast formed the point of departure of a sexual      perversion which lasted through life, is, so far as I am aware,      unique.      FOOTNOTES:    [17] Jonas Cohn (_Allgemeine AEsthetik_, 1901, p. 11) lays it down that  psychology has nothing to do with good or bad taste. \"The distinction  between good and bad taste has no meaning for psychology. On this account,  the fundamental conceptions of aesthetics cannot arise from psychology.\" It  may be a question whether this view can be accepted quite absolutely.    [18] See Appendix A: \"The Origins of the Kiss.\"    [19] See J.B. Hellier, \"On the Nipple Reflex,\" _British Medical Journal_,  November 7, 1896.

The hygiene of the skin, as well as its special cult, consists in bathing.  The bath, as is well known, attained under the Romans a degree of  development which, in Europe at all events, it has never reached before or  since, and the modern visitor to Rome carries away with him no more  impressive memory than that of the Baths of Caracalla. Since the coming of  Christianity the cult of the skin, and even its hygiene, have never again  attained the same general and unquestioned exaltation. The Church killed  the bath. St. Jerome tells us with approval that when the holy Paula noted  that any of her nuns were too careful in this matter she would gravely  reprove them, saying that \"the purity of the body and its garments means  the impurity of the soul.\"[21] Or, as the modern monk of Mount Athos still  declares: \"A man should live in dirt as in a coat of mail, so that his  soul may sojourn more securely within.\"        Our knowledge of the bathing arrangements of Roman days is      chiefly derived from Pompeii. Three public baths (two for both      men and women, who were also probably allowed to use the third      occasionally) have so far been excavated in this small town, as      well as at least three private bathing establishments (at least      one of them for women), while about a dozen houses contain      complete baths for private use. Even in a little farm house at      Boscoreale (two miles out of Pompeii) there was an elaborate      series of bathing rooms. It may be added that Pompeii was well      supplied with water. All houses but the poorest had flowing      jets, and some houses had as many as ten jets. (See Man's      _Pompeii_, Chapters XXVI-XXVIII.)        The Church succeeded to the domination of imperial Rome, and      adopted many of the methods of its predecessor. But there could      be no greater contrast than is presented by the attitude of      Paganism and of Christianity toward the bath.        As regards the tendencies of the public baths in imperial Rome,      some of the evidence is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#9)"],[1,"in the Psychology of Sex_, vol. iii,      Appendix B, History V).        Roubaud reported the case of a general's son, sexually initiated      at the age of 14 by a blonde young lady of 21 who, in order to      avoid detection, always retained her clothing: gaiters, a corset      and a silk dress; when the boy's studies were completed and he      was sent to a garrison where he could enjoy freedom he found that      his sexual desires could only be aroused by blonde women dressed      like the lady who had first aroused his sexual desires;      consequently he gave up all thoughts of matrimony, as a woman in      nightclothes produced impotence (_Traite de l'Impuissance_, p.      439). Krafft-Ebing records the somewhat similar case of a nervous      Polish boy of old family seduced at the age of 17 by a French      governess, who during several months practiced mutual      masturbation with him; in this way his attention became      attracted by her very elegant boots, and in the end he became a      confirmed boot-fetichist (_Psychopathia Sexualis_, English      translation, p. 249).        A boy of 7, of bad heredity, was taught to masturbate by a      servant girl; on one occasion she practiced this on him with her      foot without taking off her shoe; it was the first time the      manoeuvre gave him any pleasure, and an association was thus      established which led to shoe-fetichism (Hammond, _Sexual      Impotence_, p. 44). A government official whose first coitus in      youth took place on a staircase; the sound of his partner's      creaking shoes against the stairs, produced by her efforts to      accelerate orgasm, formed an association which developed into an      auditory shoe-fetichism; in the streets he was compelled to      follow ladies whose shoes creaked, ejaculation being thus      produced, while to obtain complete satisfaction he would make a      prostitute, otherwise naked, sit in front of him in her shoes,      moving her feet so that the shoes creaked. (Moraglia, _Archivio      di Psichiatria_, vol. xiii, p. 568.)        Bechterew, in St. Petersburg, has recorded the case of a man who      when a child used to fall asleep at the knees of his nurse with      his head buried in the folds of her apron; in this position he      first experienced erection and voluptuous sensations; when a      youth he had no attraction to naked women, and in real life and      in dreams was only excited sexually under conditions recalling      his early experience; in his relations with women he preferred      them dressed, and was excited by the rustling sound of their      skirts; in this case there was no traceable neuropathic taint nor      any other personal peculiarity. (Summarized in _Journal de      Psychologie Normale et Pathologique_, January-February, 1904, p.      72.)        In a curious case recorded in detail by Moll, a philologist of      sensitive temperament but sound heredity, who had always been      fond of flowers, at the age of 21 became engaged to a young lady      who wore large roses fastened in her jacket; from this time roses      became to him a sexual fetich, to kiss them caused erection, and      his erotic dreams were accompanied by visions of roses and the      hallucination of their odor; the engagement was finally broken      off and the rose-fetichism disappeared (_Untersuchungen ueber      Libido Sexualis_, bd. i, p. 540).    Such associations may naturally occur in the early experiences of even the  most normal persons. The degree to which they will influence the  subsequent life and thought and feeling depends on the degree of the  individual's morbid emotional receptivity, on the extent to which he is  hereditarily susceptible of abnormal deviation. Precocity is undoubtedly a  condition which favors such deviation; a child who is precociously and  abnormally sensitive to persons of the opposite sex before puberty has  established the normal channels of sexual desire, is peculiarly liable to  become the prey of a chance symbolism. All degrees of such symbolism are  possible. While the average insensitive person may fail to perceive them  at all, for the more alert and imaginative lover they are a fascinating  part of the highly charged crystallization of passion. A more nervously  exceptional person, when once such a symbolism has become firmly  implanted, may find it an absolutely essential element in the charm of a  beloved and charming person. Finally, for the individual who is thoroughly  unsound the symbol becomes generalized; a person is no longer desired at  all, being merely regarded as an appendage of the symbol, or being  dispensed with altogether; the symbol is alone desired, and is fully  adequate to impart by itself complete sexual gratification. While it must  be considered a morbid state to demand a symbol as an almost essential  part of the charm of a desired person, it is only in the final condition,  in which the symbol becomes all-sufficing, that we have a true and  complete perversion. In the less complete forms of symbolism it is still  the woman who is desired, and the ends of procreation may be served; when  the woman is ignored and the mere symbol is an adequate and even preferred  stimulus to detumescence the pathological condition becomes complete.    Krafft-Ebing regarded shoe-fetichism as, in large measure, a more or less  latent form of masochism, the foot or the shoe being the symbol of the  subjection and humiliation which the masochist feels in the presence of  the beloved object. Moll is also inclined to accept such a connection.        \"The very numerous class of boot-and-shoe-fetichists,\"      Krafft-Ebing wrote, \"forms the transition to the manifestations      of another independent perversion, i.e., fetichism itself; but it      stands in closer relationship to the former.... It is highly      probable, and shown by a correct classification of the observed      cases, that the majority, and perhaps all of the cases of      shoe-fetichism, rest upon a basis of more or less conscious      masochistic desire for self-humiliation.... The majority or all      may be looked upon as instances of latent masochism (the motive      remaining unconscious) in which the _female foot or shoe, as the      masochist's fetich_, has acquired an independent significance.\"      (_Psychopathia Sexualis_, English translation of tenth edition,      pp. 159, et seq.) \"Though Krafft-Ebing may not have cleared up      the whole matter,\" Moll remarks, \"I regard his deductions      concerning the connection of foot-and-shoe fetichism to masochism      as the most important progress that has been made in the      theoretic study of sexual perversions.... In any case, the      connection is very frequent.\" (_Kontraere Sexualempfindung_, third      edition, p. 306.)    It is quite easy to see that this supposed identity of masochism and  foot-fetichism forms a seductive theory. It is also undoubtedly true that  a masochist may very easily be inclined to find in his mistress's foot an  aid to the ecstatic self-abnegation which he desires to attain.[20] But  only confusion is attained by any general attempt to amalgamate masochism  and foot-fetichism. In the broad sense in which erotic symbolism is here  understood, both masochism and foot-fetichism may be cooerdinated as  symbolisms; for the masochist his self-humiliating impulses are the symbol  of ecstatic adoration; for the foot-fetichist his mistress's foot or shoe  is the concentrated symbol of all that is most beautiful and elegant and  feminine in her personality. But if in this sense they are cooerdinated,  they remain entirely distinct and have not even any necessary tendency to  become merged. Masochism merely simulates foot-fetichism; for the  masochist the boot is not strictly a symbol, it is only an instrument  which enables him to carry out his impulse; the true sexual symbol for him  is not the boot, but the emotion of self-subjection. For the  foot-fetichist, on the other hand, the foot or the shoe is not a mere  instrument, but a true symbol; the focus of his worship, an idealized  object which he is content to contemplate or reverently touch. He has no  necessary impulse to any self-degrading action, nor any constant emotion  of subjection. It may be noted that in the very typical case of  foot-fetichism which is presented to us in the person of Restif de la  Bretonne (_ante_, p. 18), he repeatedly speaks of \"subjecting\" the woman  for whom he feels this fetichistic adoration, and mentions that even when  still a child he especially admired a delicate and fairy-like girl in this  respect because she seemed to him easier to subjugate. Throughout life  Restif's attitude toward women was active and masculine, without the  slightest trace of masochism.[21]    To suppose that a fetichistic admiration of his mistress's foot is due to  a lover's latent desire to be kicked, is as unreasonable as it would be to  suppose that a fetichistic admiration for her hand indicated a latent  desire to have his ears boxed. In determining whether we are concerned  with a case of foot-fetichism or of masochism we must take into  consideration the whole of the subject's mental and emotional attitude. An  act, however definite, will not suffice as a criterion, for the same act  in different persons may have altogether different implications. To  amalgamate the two is the result of inadequate psychological analysis and  only leads to confusion.    It is, however, often very difficult to decide whether we are dealing with  a case which is predominantly one of masochism or of foot-fetichism. The  nature of the action desired, as we have seen, will not suffice to  determine the psychological character of the perversion. Krafft-Ebing  believed that the desire to be trodden on, very frequently experienced by  masochists, is absolutely symptomatic of masochism.[22] This is scarcely  the case. The desire to be"]]]
