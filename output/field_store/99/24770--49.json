When this mixture begins to  boil, lay in your fish and cook thoroughly. When done remove fish to  platter.    Put liquor back on stove, add three tablespoons of granulated sugar  (which has been melted and browned in a pie plate without water), then  add two tablespoons of flour which has been rubbed smooth with a little  water. Let boil well and pour over fish. If not sweet enough add more  sugar. Serve cold.      SWEET AND SOUR FISH    Place the fish in strong salt water for one hour before cooking. Take  three parts of water and one of vinegar, put in saucepan with some  sliced onions and some raisins, and let boil until tender. Add brown  sugar to taste, a piece of rye bread from which the crust has been  removed, and some molasses. Boil the sauce, then place the fish in and  let all cook twenty minutes. When done, arrange on platter with sliced  lemon and chopped parsley.      SWEET SOUR FISH WITH WINE    Put on to boil in fish kettle, one glass water, one-half glass vinegar,  two tablespoons of brown sugar, one-half dozen cloves, one-half teaspoon  of ground cinnamon, one onion cut in round slices. Boil thoroughly, then  strain and add to it one lemon cut in round slices, one goblet of red  wine, one dozen raisins, one tablespoon of pounded almonds; put on stove  again, and when it comes to a boil, add fish that has been cut up and  salted. Cook until done, remove fish to a platter, and to the liquor add  a small piece Leb-kuchen or ginger cake, and stir in the well-beaten  yolks of four eggs; stir carefully or it will curdle. If not sweet  enough add more sugar. Pour over fish. Shad or trout is the best fish to  use.      FISH STOCK    Put in a saucepan a tablespoon of butter or butter substitute, add a  tablespoon each of chopped onion, carrot and turnip. Fry them without  browning, then add fish-bones, head, and trimmings, a stalk of celery,  sprigs of parsley and of thyme, a bay-leaf, a tomato or a slice of  lemon. Cover with water and let them simmer for an hour or more. Season  with salt and pepper and strain.      PIKE WITH EGG SAUCE    Clean the fish thoroughly, and wash it in hot water, wipe dry and salt  inside and out. If you heat the salt it will penetrate through the meat  of the fish in less time. Take a kettle, lay in it a piece of butter  about the size of an egg; cut up an onion, some celery root, parsley  root and a few slices of lemon, lay the fish in, either whole or cut up  in slices; boil in enough water to just cover the fish, and add more  salt if required, add a dozen whole peppers, black or white; season with  ground white pepper. Let the fish boil quickly. In the meantime beat up  the yolks of two eggs, and pound a dozen almonds to a paste, add to the  beaten yolks, together with a tablespoon of cold water. When done remove  the fish to a large platter; but to ascertain whether the fish has  cooked long enough, take hold of the fins, if they come out readily your  fish has cooked enough. Strain the sauce through a sieve, taking out the  slices of lemon and with them garnish the top of the fish; add the  strained sauce to the beaten eggs, stirring constantly as you do so;  then return the sauce to the kettle, and stir until it boils, remove  quickly and pour it over the fish. When it is cold garnish with curly  parsley.      GEFILLTE FISCH    Prepare trout, pickerel or pike in the following manner: After the fish  has been scaled and thoroughly cleaned, remove all the meat that adheres  to the skin, being careful not to injure the skin; take out all the meat  from head to tail, cut open along the backbone, removing it also; but do  not disfigure the head and tail; chop the meat in a chopping bowl, then  heat about a quarter of a pound of butter in a spider, add two  tablespoons chopped parsley, and some soaked white bread; remove from  the fire and add an onion grated, salt, pepper, pounded almonds, the  yolks of two eggs, also a very little nutmeg grated. Mix all thoroughly  and fill the skin until it looks natural. Boil in salt water, containing  a piece of butter, celery root, parsley and an onion; when done remove  from the fire and lay on a platter. The fish should be cooked for one  and one-quarter hours, or until done. Thicken the sauce with yolks of  two eggs, adding a few slices of lemon.    This fish may be baked but must be rolled in flour and dotted with bits  of butter.      RUSSIAN FISH CAKES    Take three pounds of fish (weakfish or carp, pickerel or haddock or  whitefish, any fat fish with a fish poor in it). Remove skin and bones  from the fish and chop flesh very fine, add a good-sized onion, minced  or grated, make a depression in the centre of the chopped fish and add  three-quarters cup of water, one-half cup of soft bread crumbs, salt and  pepper to taste, one-fourth cup of sugar, two egg whites and two  tablespoons of melted butter. Chop until very smooth and form into cakes  containing a generous tablespoonful each. Put the bones and skins into a  saucepan with an onion sliced and a tablespoon of butter and add the  fish cakes. Cover with water and simmer for one and a quarter hours.  Then remove the cakes and strain off the gravy into the two egg yolks  which have been slightly beaten together with one teaspoon of sugar;  stir over the heat until thickened, but do not boil it. Pour over fish  cakes and serve either hot or cold. The butter and sugar may be omitted  if so desired.      GEFILLTE FISCH WITH EGG SAUCE    Cut a five-pound haddock into four-inch slices. Cut a big hole into each  slice, preserving the backbone and skin. Put this meat, cut from the  fish, into a wooden tray, add to it four large onions and a sprig of  parsley. Chop until very fine, then add two eggs, a dash of pepper and  cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and a tablespoon of sugar. To this add enough  cracker dust to stiffen it. Put this filling into the holes cut in the  fish.    Take a saucepan, put in one sliced onion, a sprig of parsley, a small  sliced carrot, a dash of pepper, and a pinch of salt. Put the fish into  the saucepan, cover with cold water, and let it boil slowly for one  hour. At the end of the hour take out the fish, and put on a platter.  Preserve the water or gravy in which the fish was boiled for the sauce.    Egg sauce for fish: Beat the yokes of two eggs thoroughly. Into the  beaten yolks slowly pour the gravy in which the fish was boiled,  stirring constantly. Stand this on the back of the stove to boil for  five minutes, stirring constantly so as to prevent burning.      FILLED FISH--TURKISH STYLE    No. 1. Bone some fat fish, boil in salt and water; when done take a  little of the fish soup, one egg, beat until light, add gradually the  juice of one-half lemon.      FRITADA    No. 2. Steam the fish and bone. Take four good-sized tomatoes, cut them  up, add chopped parsley, scallions or leeks cut in small pieces, a  little celery, salt and pepper to taste and four eggs well-beaten; mix  all these ingredients very well with the boned fish, form in omelet  shape. Place in oven in pan greased with olive oil and bake until well  browned.      HECHT (PICKEREL)    This fish is best prepared \"scharf.\" Clean your fish thoroughly and salt  the day previous; wrap it in a clean towel and lay it on ice until  wanted. Line a kettle with celery and parsley roots; cut up an onion,  add a lump of fresh butter, and pack the fish in the kettle, head first,  either whole or cut up; sprinkle a little salt and white pepper over all  and add about a dozen peppercorns; put on enough water to just cover,  and add a whole lemon cut in slices. Do not let the fish boil quickly.  Add about a dozen pounded almonds. By this time the fish will be ready  to turn, then beat up the yolks of two eggs in a bowl, to be added to  the sauce after the fish is boiled. Try the fish with a fork and if the  meat loosens readily it is done. Take up each peace carefully, if it has  been cut up, and arrange on a large platter, head first and so on, make  the fish appear whole, and garnish with the slices of lemon and sprigs  of parsley; then mince up some parsley and garnish top of the fish,  around the lemon slices. Thicken the gravy by adding the beaten yolks,  add a tablespoon of cold water to the yolks before adding to the boiling  sauce; stir, remove from the fire at once and pour over the fish. If you  prefer the sauce strained, then strain before adding the yolks of the  eggs and almonds.    Haddock, sea-bass, pike, perch, weakfish and porgies may be cooked  \"scharf.\"      FRESH COD OR STRIPED BASS    Cut into pieces ready to serve, after which salt them for an hour. Into  the fish kettle put a quantity of water, large onion sliced, carrot also  sliced, turnip, celery root, and boil fifteen minutes. Add the fish and  two tablespoons of butter, tiny piece of cinnamon, pepper to taste. Boil  fifteen minutes longer, then add teaspoon of flour mixed with cold  water. Boil up well and add salt or pepper if needed. Remove fish and  arrange on platter. Beat yolks of two eggs with a tablespoon of cold  water; after straining out vegetables, add the hot gravy in which fish  was boiled. Return to fire and stir till thick enough. Garnish with  chopped parsley.      AHILADO SAUCE (TURKISH)    Mix some tomato sauce, olive oil, parsley, salt and pepper. Boil sauce  first, and add boiled sea-bass or flounders.      BOILED TROUT    Cut up a celery root, one onion, and a sprig of parsley, tie the fish in  a napkin and lay it on this bed of roots; pour in enough water to cover  and add a dash of vinegar--the vinegar keeps the fish firm--then boil  over a quick fire and add more salt to the water in which the fish has  been boiled. Lay your fish on a hot platter and prepare the following  sauce: set a cup of sweet cream in a kettle, heat it, add a tablespoon  of fresh butter, salt and pepper, and thicken with a tablespoon of flour  which has been wet with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12351"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 07 (#9)"],[1,"to the importance of the infinite difference  between a principle in the abstract and its realization in the concrete.  In the process before us the essential nature of freedom--which involves  absolute necessity--is to be displayed as coming to a consciousness of  itself (for it is in its very nature, self-consciousness) and thereby  realizing its existence. Itself is its own object of attainment and the  sole aim of Spirit. This result it is at which the process of the  world's history has been continually aiming, and to which the sacrifices  that have ever and anon been laid on the vast altar of the earth,  through the long lapse of ages, have been offered. This is the only aim  that sees itself realized and fulfilled, the only pole of repose amid  the ceaseless change of events and conditions, and the sole efficient  principle that pervades them. This final aim is God's purpose with the  world; but God is the absolutely perfect Being, and can, therefore, will  nothing other than Himself--His own will. The nature of His will--that  is His nature itself--is what we here call the idea of freedom,  translating the language of religion into that of thought. The question,  then, which we may next put, is What means does this principle of  freedom use for its realization? This is the second point we have to  consider.    (2) The question of the means by which freedom develops itself to a  world conducts us to the phenomenon of history itself. Although freedom  is, primarily, an undeveloped idea, the means it uses are external and  phenomenal, presenting themselves in history to our sensuous vision. The  first glance at history convinces us that the actions of men proceed  from their needs, their passions, when the occasion seems to call for  it--is that what we call principle, aim, destiny, or the nature and idea  of Spirit, is something merely general and abstract. Principle--Plan of  Existence--Law--is a hidden, undeveloped essence which, as such--however  true in itself--is not completely real. Aims, principles, etc., have a  place in our thoughts, in our subjective design only, but not as yet in  the sphere of reality. That which exists for itself only is a  possibility, a potentiality, but it has not emerged into existence. A  second element must be introduced in order to produce actuality--viz.,  actuation, realization; and its motive power is the will--the activity  of man in the widest sense. It is only by this activity that that Idea,  as well as abstract characteristics generally, are realized, actualized;  for of themselves they are powerless. The motive power that puts them in  operation and gives them determinate existence, is the need, instinct,  inclination, and passion of man. That some conception of mine should be  developed into act and existence, is my earnest desire; I wish to assert  my personality in connection with it; I wish to be satisfied by its  execution. If I am to exert myself for any object, it must in some way  or other be _my_ object. In the accomplishment of such or such designs I  must at the same time find _my_ satisfaction; although the purpose for  which I exert myself includes a complication of results, many of which  have no interest for me. This is the absolute right of personal  existence--to find _itself_ satisfied in its activity and labor. If men  are to interest themselves for anything, they must, so to speak, have  part of their existence involved in it and find their individuality  gratified by its attainment. Here a mistake must be avoided. We intend  blame, and justly impute it as a fault, when we say of an individual  that he is \"interested\" (in taking part in such or such  transactions)--that is, seeks only his private advantage. In  reprehending this we find fault with him for furthering his personal  aims without any regard to a more comprehensive design, of which he  takes advantage to promote his own interest or which, with this view,  he even sacrifices. But he who is active in promoting an object is not  simply \"interested,\" but interested in that object itself. Language  faithfully expresses this distinction. Nothing therefore happens,  nothing is accomplished, unless the individuals concerned seek their own  satisfaction in the issue. They are particular units of society--that  is, they have special needs, instincts, and interests generally,  peculiar to themselves. Among these needs are not only such as we  usually call necessities--the stimuli of individual desire and  volition--but also those connected with individual views and  convictions; or--to use a term expressing less decision--leanings of  opinion, supposing the impulses of reflection, understanding, and  reason, to have been awakened. In these cases people demand, if they are  to exert themselves in any direction, that the object should commend  itself to them, that, in point of opinion-whether as to its goodness,  justice, advantage, profit they should be able to \"enter into it\"  (_dabei sein_). This is a consideration of special importance in our  age, when people are less than formerly influenced by reliance on  others, and by authority; when, on the contrary, they devote their  activities to a cause on the ground of their own understanding, their  independent conviction and opinion.    We assert then that nothing has been accomplished without interest on  the part of the actors; and--if interest be called passion, inasmuch as  the whole individuality, to the neglect of all other actual or possible  interests and claims, is devoted to an object with every fibre of  volition, concentrating all its desires and powers upon it--we may  affirm absolutely that nothing great in the world has been accomplished  without passion. Two elements, therefore, enter into the object of our  investigation--the first the Idea, the second the complex of human  passions; the one the warp, the other the woof of the vast arras-web of  universal history. The concrete mean and union of the two is liberty,  under the conditions of morality in a State. We have spoken of the idea  of freedom as the nature of Spirit, and the absolute goal of history.  Passion is regarded as a thing of sinister aspect, as more or less  immoral. Man is required to have no passions. Passion, it is true, is  not quite the suitable word for what I wish to express. I mean here  nothing more than human activity as resulting from private interests,  special, or if you will, self-seeking designs--with this qualification,  that the whole energy of will and character is devoted to their  attainment, and that other interests (which would in themselves  constitute attractive aims), or, rather, all things else, are sacrificed  to them. The object in question is so bound up with the man's will that  it entirely and alone determines the \"hue of resolution\" and is  inseparable from it; it has become the very essence of his volition. For  a person is a specific existence--not man in general (a term to which no  real existence corresponds); but a particular human being. The term  \"character\" likewise expresses this idiosyncrasy of will and  intelligence. But character comprehends all peculiarities whatever, the  way in which a person conducts himself in private relations, etc., and  is not limited to his idiosyncrasy in its practical and active phase. I  shall, therefore, use the term \"passion,\" understanding thereby the  particular bent of character, as far as the peculiarities of volition  are not limited to private interest but supply the impelling and  actuating force for accomplishing deeds shared in by the community at  large. Passion is, in the first instance, the subjective and therefore  the formal side of energy, will, and activity--leaving the object or aim  still undetermined. And there is a similar relation of formality to  reality in merely individual conviction, individual views, individual  conscience. It is always a question of essential importance--what is the  purport of my conviction, what the object of my passion--in deciding  whether the one or the other is of a true and substantial nature.  Conversely, if it is so, it will inevitably attain actual existence--be  realized.    From this comment on the second essential element in the historical  embodiment of an aim, we infer--glancing at the institution of the State  in passing--that a State is well constituted and internally powerful when  the private interest of its citizens is one with the common interest of  the State, when the one finds its gratification and realization in the  other--a proposition in itself very important. But in a State many  institutions must be adopted, and much political machinery invented,  accompanied by appropriate political arrangements--necessitating long  struggles of the understanding before what is really appropriate can be  discovered--involving, moreover, contentions with private interest and  passions and a tedious discipline of the latter in order to bring about  the desired harmony. The epoch when a State attains this harmonious  condition marks the period of its bloom, its virtue, its vigor, and its  prosperity. But the history of mankind does not begin with a conscious  aim of any kind, as is the case with the particular circles into which  men form themselves of set purpose. The mere social instinct implies a  conscious purpose of security for life and property; and when society has  been constituted this purpose becomes more comprehensive. The history of  the world begins with its general aim--the realization of the idea of  Spirit--only in an implicit form (_an sich_), that is, as nature--a  hidden, most profoundly hidden, unconscious instinct; and the whole  process of history (as already observed) is directed to rendering this  unconscious impulse a conscious one. Thus appearing in the form of  merely natural existence, natural will--that which has been called the  subjective side--physical craving, instinct, passion, private"]]]
