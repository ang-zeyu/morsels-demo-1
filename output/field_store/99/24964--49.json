Henry V. then compelled the  captive James I. to join him, and (1421) at Bauge Bridge the Scots, with  the famed La Hire, routed the army of Henry's brother, the Duke of  Clarence, who, with 2000 of the English, fell in the action.  The victory  was fruitless; at Crevant (1423) the Scots were defeated; at Verneuil  (1424) they were almost exterminated.  None the less the remnant, with  fresh levies, continued to war for their old ally, and, under Sir Hugh  Kennedy and others, suffered at Rouvray (February 1429), and were with  the victorious French at Orleans (May 1429) under the leadership of  Jeanne d'Arc.  The combination of Scots and French, at the last push,  always saved the independence of both kingdoms.    The character of Albany, who, under his father, Robert III., and during  the captivity of James I., ruled Scotland so long, is enigmatic.  He is  well spoken of by the contemporary Wyntoun, author of a chronicle in  rhyme; and in the Latin of Wyntoun's continuator, Bower.  He kept on  friendly terms with the Douglases, he was popular in so far as he was  averse to imposing taxation; and perhaps the anarchy and oppression which  preceded the return of James I. to Scotland were due not to the weakness  of Albany but to that of his son and successor, Murdoch, and to the  iniquities of Murdoch's sons.    The death of Henry V. (1422) and the ambition of Cardinal Beaufort,  determined to wed his niece Jane Beaufort to a crowned king, may have  been among the motives which led the English Government (their own king,  Henry VI., being a child) to set free the royal captive (1424).          CHAPTER XI.  JAMES I.      On March 28, 1424, James I. was released, on a ransom of 40,000 pounds,  and after his marriage with Jane Beaufort, grand-daughter of John of  Gaunt, son of Edward III.  The story of their wooing (of course in the  allegorical manner of the age, and with poetical conventions in place of  actual details) is told in James's poem, \"The King's Quair,\" a beautiful  composition in the school of Chaucer, of which literary scepticism has  vainly tried to rob the royal author.  James was the ablest and not the  most scrupulous of the Stuarts.  His captivity had given him an English  education, a belief in order, and in English parliamentary methods, and a  fiery determination to put down the oppression of the nobles.  \"If God  gives me but a dog's life,\" he said, \"I will make the key keep the castle  and the bracken bush keep the cow.\"  Before his first Parliament, in May  1424, James arrested Murdoch's eldest son, Sir Walter Fleming of  Cumbernauld, and the younger Boyd of Kilmarnock.  The Parliament left a  Committee of the Estates (\"The Lords of the Articles\") to carry out the  royal policy.  Taxes for the payment of James's ransom were imposed; to  impose them was easy, \"passive resistance\" was easier; the money was  never paid, and James's noble hostages languished in England.  He next  arrested the old Earl of Lennox, and Sir Robert Graham of the Kincardine  family, later his murderer.    These were causes of unpopularity.  During a new Parliament (1425) James  imprisoned the new Duke of Albany (Murdoch) and his son Alexander, and  seized their castles. {57}  The Albanys and Lennox were executed; their  estates were forfeited; but resentment dogged a king who was too fierce  and too hurried a reformer, perhaps too cruel an avenger of his own  wrongs.    Our knowledge of the events of his reign is vague; but a king of Scotland  could never, with safety, treat any of his nobles as criminals; the whole  order was concerned to prevent or avenge severity of justice.    At a Parliament in Inverness (1427) he seized the greatest of the  Highland magnates whom he had summoned; they were hanged or imprisoned,  and, after resistance, Alastair, the new Lord of the Isles, did penance  at Holyrood, before being immured in Tantallon Castle.  His cousin,  Donald Balloch, defeated Mar at Inverlochy (where Montrose later routed  Argyll) (1431).  Not long afterwards Donald fled to Ireland, whence a  head, said to be his, was sent to James, but Donald lived to fight  another day.    Without a standing army to garrison the inaccessible Highlands, the Crown  could neither preserve peace in those regions nor promote justice.  The  system of violent and perfidious punishments merely threw the Celts into  the arms of England.    Execution itself was less terrible to the nobles than the forfeiting of  their lands and the disinheriting of their families.  None the less,  James (1425-1427) seized the lands of the late Earl of Lennox, made  Malise Graham surrender the earldom of Strathearn in exchange for the  barren title of Earl of Menteith, and sent the sufferer as a hostage into  England.  The Earl of March, son of the Earl who, under Robert III., had  gone over to the English cause, was imprisoned and stripped of his  ancient domains on the Eastern Border; and James, disinheriting Lord  Erskine, annexed the earldom of Mar to the Crown.    In a Parliament at Perth (March 1428) James permitted the minor barons  and freeholders to abstain from these costly assemblies on the condition  of sending two \"wise men\" to represent each sheriffdom: a Speaker was to  be elected, and the shires were to pay the expenses of the wise men.  But  the measure was unpopular, and in practice lapsed.  Excellent laws were  passed, but were not enforced.    In July-November 1428 a marriage was arranged between Margaret the infant  daughter of James and the son (later Louis XI.) of the still uncrowned  Dauphin, Charles VIII. of France.  Charles announced to his subjects  early in 1429 that an army of 6000 Scots was to land in France; that  James himself, if necessary, would follow; but Jeanne d'Arc declared that  there was no help from Scotland, none save from God and herself.  She was  right: no sooner had she won her victories at Orleans, Jargeau, Pathay,  and elsewhere (May-June 1429) than James made a truce with England which  enabled Cardinal Beaufort to throw his large force of anti-Hussite  crusaders into France, where they secured Normandy.  The Scots in France,  nevertheless, fought under the Maid in her last successful action, at  Lagny (April 1430).    An heir to the Crown, James, was born in October 1430, while the King was  at strife with the Pope, and asserting for King and Parliament power over  the Provincial Councils of the Church.  An interdict was threatened,  James menaced the rich and lax religious orders with secular reformation;  settled the Carthusians at Perth, to show an example of holy living; and  pursued his severities against many of his nobles.    His treatment of the Earl of Strathearn (despoiled and sent as a hostage  to England) aroused the wrath of the Earl's uncle, Robert Graham, who  bearded James in Parliament, was confiscated, fled across the Highland  line, and, on February 20, 1437, aided, it is said by the old Earl of  Atholl (a grandson of Robert II. by his second marriage), led a force  against the King in the monastery of the Black Friars at Perth, surprised  him, and butchered him.  The energy of his Queen brought the murderers,  and Atholl himself, to die under unspeakable torments.    James's reforms were hurried, violent, and, as a rule, incapable of  surviving the anarchy of his son's minority: his new Court of Session,  sitting in judgment thrice a-year, was his most fortunate innovation.          CHAPTER XII.  JAMES II.      Scone, with its sacred stone, being so near Perth and the Highlands, was  perilous, and the coronation of James II. was therefore held at Holyrood  (March 25, 1437).  The child, who was but seven years of age, was bandied  to and fro like a shuttlecock between rival adventurers.  The Earl of  Douglas (Archibald, fifth Earl, died 1439) took no leading part in the  strife of factions: one of them led by Sir William Crichton, who held the  important post of Commander of Edinburgh Castle; the other by Sir  Alexander Livingstone of Callendar.    The great old Houses had been shaken by the severities of James I., at  least for the time.  In a Government of factions influenced by private  greed, there was no important difference in policy, and we need not  follow the transference of the royal person from Crichton in Edinburgh to  Livingstone in Stirling Castle; the coalitions between these worthies,  the battles between the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts, who had to  avenge Stewart of Derneley, Constable of the Scottish contingent in  France, who was slain by Sir Thomas Boyd.  The queen-mother married Sir  James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorne, and (August 3, 1439) she was  captured by Livingstone, while her husband, in the mysterious words of  the chronicler, was \"put in a pitt and bollit.\"  In a month Jane Beaufort  gave Livingstone an amnesty; he, not the Stewart family, not the queen-  mother, now held James.    To all this the new young Earl of Douglas, a boy of eighteen, tacitly  assented.  He was the most powerful and wealthiest subject in Scotland;  in France he was Duc de Touraine; he was descended in lawful wedlock from  Robert II.; \"he micht ha'e been the king,\" as the ballad says of the  bonny Earl of Moray.  But he held proudly aloof from both Livingstone and  Crichton, who were stealing the king alternately: they then combined,  invited Douglas to Edinburgh Castle, with his brother David, and served  up the ominous bull's head at that \"black dinner\" recorded in a ballad  fragment. {61}  They decapitated the two Douglas boys; the earldom fell  to their granduncle, James the Fat, and presently, on _his_ death (1443),  to young William Douglas, after which \"bands,\" or illegal covenants,  between the various leaders of factions, led to private wars of shifting  fortune.

The copying-clerk, or, as the lady said, the brown field-bird, was  put into a small cage, close to the Canary, and not far from \"my good  Polly.\" The only human sounds that the Parrot could bawl out  were, \"Come, let us be men!\" Everything else that he said was as  unintelligible to everybody as the chirping of the Canary, except to the  clerk, who was now a bird too: he understood his companion perfectly.    \"I flew about beneath the green palms and the blossoming almond-trees,\"  sang the Canary; \"I flew around, with my brothers and sisters, over  the beautiful flowers, and over the glassy lakes, where the bright  water-plants nodded to me from below. There, too, I saw many  splendidly-dressed paroquets, that told the drollest stories, and the  wildest fairy tales without end.\"    \"Oh! those were uncouth birds,\" answered the Parrot. \"They had no  education, and talked of whatever came into their head.    \"If my mistress and all her friends can laugh at what I say, so may you  too, I should think. It is a great fault to have no taste for what is  witty or amusing--come, let us be men.\"    \"Ah, you have no remembrance of love for the charming maidens that  danced beneath the outspread tents beside the bright fragrant flowers?  Do you no longer remember the sweet fruits, and the cooling juice in  the wild plants of our never-to-be-forgotten home?\" said the former  inhabitant of the Canary Isles, continuing his dithyrambic.    \"Oh, yes,\" said the Parrot; \"but I am far better off here. I am well  fed, and get friendly treatment. I know I am a clever fellow; and that  is all I care about. Come, let us be men. You are of a poetical nature,  as it is called--I, on the contrary, possess profound knowledge and  inexhaustible wit. You have genius; but clear-sighted, calm discretion  does not take such lofty flights, and utter such high natural tones.  For this they have covered you over--they never do the like to me; for  I cost more. Besides, they are afraid of my beak; and I have always a  witty answer at hand. Come, let us be men!\"    \"O warm spicy land of my birth,\" sang the Canary bird; \"I will sing of  thy dark-green bowers, of the calm bays where the pendent boughs  kiss the surface of the water; I will sing of the rejoicing of all my  brothers and sisters where the cactus grows in wanton luxuriance.\"    \"Spare us your elegiac tones,\" said the Parrot giggling. \"Rather speak  of something at which one may laugh heartily. Laughing is an infallible  sign of the highest degree of mental development. Can a dog, or a horse  laugh? No, but they can cry. The gift of laughing was given to man  alone. Ha! ha! ha!\" screamed Polly, and added his stereotype witticism.  \"Come, let us be men!\"    \"Poor little Danish grey-bird,\" said the Canary; \"you have been caught  too. It is, no doubt, cold enough in your woods, but there at least  is the breath of liberty; therefore fly away. In the hurry they have  forgotten to shut your cage, and the upper window is open. Fly, my  friend; fly away. Farewell!\"    Instinctively the Clerk obeyed; with a few strokes of his wings he was  out of the cage; but at the same moment the door, which was only ajar,  and which led to the next room, began to creak, and supple and creeping  came the large tomcat into the room, and began to pursue him. The  frightened Canary fluttered about in his cage; the Parrot flapped his  wings, and cried, \"Come, let us be men!\" The Clerk felt a mortal fright,  and flew through the window, far away over the houses and streets. At  last he was forced to rest a little.    The neighboring house had a something familiar about it; a window stood  open; he flew in; it was his own room. He perched upon the table.    \"Come, let us be men!\" said he, involuntarily imitating the chatter of  the Parrot, and at the same moment he was again a copying-clerk; but he  was sitting in the middle of the table.    \"Heaven help me!\" cried he. \"How did I get up here--and so buried in  sleep, too? After all, that was a very unpleasant, disagreeable dream  that haunted me! The whole story is nothing but silly, stupid nonsense!\"      VI. The Best That the Galoshes Gave    The following day, early in the morning, while the Clerk was still in  bed, someone knocked at his door. It was his neighbor, a young Divine,  who lived on the same floor. He walked in.    \"Lend me your Galoshes,\" said he; \"it is so wet in the garden, though  the sun is shining most invitingly. I should like to go out a little.\"    He got the Galoshes, and he was soon below in a little duodecimo garden,  where between two immense walls a plumtree and an apple-tree were  standing. Even such a little garden as this was considered in the  metropolis of Copenhagen as a great luxury.    The young man wandered up and down the narrow paths, as well as the  prescribed limits would allow; the clock struck six; without was heard  the horn of a post-boy.    \"To travel! to travel!\" exclaimed he, overcome by most painful and  passionate remembrances. \"That is the happiest thing in the world! That  is the highest aim of all my wishes! Then at last would the agonizing  restlessness be allayed, which destroys my existence! But it must be  far, far away! I would behold magnificent Switzerland; I would travel to  Italy, and--\"    It was a good thing that the power of the Galoshes worked as  instantaneously as lightning in a powder-magazine would do, otherwise  the poor man with his overstrained wishes would have travelled about  the world too much for himself as well as for us. In short, he was  travelling. He was in the middle of Switzerland, but packed up with  eight other passengers in the inside of an eternally-creaking diligence;  his head ached till it almost split, his weary neck could hardly bear  the heavy load, and his feet, pinched by his torturing boots, were  terribly swollen. He was in an intermediate state between sleeping and  waking; at variance with himself, with his company, with the country,  and with the government. In his right pocket he had his letter of  credit, in the left, his passport, and in a small leathern purse some  double louis d'or, carefully sewn up in the bosom of his waistcoat.  Every dream proclaimed that one or the other of these valuables was  lost; wherefore he started up as in a fever; and the first movement  which his hand made, described a magic triangle from the right pocket to  the left, and then up towards the bosom, to feel if he had them all safe  or not. From the roof inside the carriage, umbrellas, walking-sticks,  hats, and sundry other articles were depending, and hindered the view,  which was particularly imposing. He now endeavored as well as he  was able to dispel his gloom, which was caused by outward chance  circumstances merely, and on the bosom of nature imbibe the milk of  purest human enjoyment.    Grand, solemn, and dark was the whole landscape around. The gigantic  pine-forests, on the pointed crags, seemed almost like little tufts of  heather, colored by the surrounding clouds. It began to snow, a cold  wind blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride.    \"Augh!\" sighed he, \"were we only on the other side the Alps, then we  should have summer, and I could get my letters of credit cashed. The  anxiety I feel about them prevents me enjoying Switzerland. Were I but  on the other side!\"    And so saying he was on the other side in Italy, between Florence and  Rome. Lake Thracymene, illumined by the evening sun, lay like flaming  gold between the dark-blue mountain-ridges; here, where Hannibal  defeated Flaminius, the rivers now held each other in their green  embraces; lovely, half-naked children tended a herd of black swine,  beneath a group of fragrant laurel-trees, hard by the road-side.  Could we render this inimitable picture properly, then would everybody  exclaim, \"Beautiful, unparalleled Italy!\" But neither the young Divine  said so, nor anyone of his grumbling companions in the coach of the  vetturino.    The poisonous flies and gnats swarmed around by thousands; in vain one  waved myrtle-branches about like mad; the audacious insect population  did not cease to sting; nor was there a single person in the  well-crammed carriage whose face was not swollen and sore from their  ravenous bites. The poor horses, tortured almost to death, suffered most  from this truly Egyptian plague; the flies alighted upon them in large  disgusting swarms; and if the coachman got down and scraped them off,  hardly a minute elapsed before they were there again. The sun now set: a  freezing cold, though of short duration pervaded the whole creation;  it was like a horrid gust coming from a burial-vault on a warm summer's  day--but all around the mountains retained that wonderful green tone  which we see in some old pictures, and which, should we not have seen a  similar play of color in the South, we declare at once to be unnatural.  It was a glorious prospect; but the stomach was empty, the body tired;  all that the heart cared and longed for was good night-quarters; yet  how would they be? For these one looked much more anxiously than for the  charms of nature, which every where were so profusely displayed.    The road led through an olive-grove, and here the solitary inn was  situated. Ten or twelve crippled-beggars had encamped outside. The  healthiest of them resembled, to use an expression of Marryat's,  \"Hunger's eldest son when he had come of age\"; the others were either  blind, had withered legs and crept about on their hands, or withered  arms and fingerless hands. It was the most wretched misery, dragged  from among the filthiest rags. \"Excellenza, miserabili!\" sighed they,  thrusting forth their deformed limbs to view. Even the hostess, with  bare feet, uncombed hair, and dressed in a garment of doubtful color,  received the guests grumblingly. The doors were fastened with a loop of  string; the floor of the rooms presented a stone paving half torn  up; bats"]]]
