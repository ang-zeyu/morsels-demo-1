They said:  \"We understand you have brigands in your house.\" He was trembling with  fear, but answered, \"Come in and see for yourself, if you think so.\"    The soldiers were satisfied by his frank open manner and, as they knew him  to be a good man, did not search the house, but went away. The poor fellow  was frightened nearly to death, but as his place was being watched it was  impossible for the brigands to leave during the day.    At night they stripped themselves, shaved their heads, and dressed like  coolies, and were able to get to the ladder down the city wall just below  the mission compound where they could escape into the hills.    The day after this occurrence, about four o'clock in the afternoon, a  breathless Chinese appeared at the house with a note to Mr. Bankhardt  saying that his Chinese teacher and the mission school cook had been  arrested by the Northern soldiers and were to be beheaded in an hour. We  hurried to the police office where they were confined and found that not  only the two men but three others were in custody.    The mission cook owned a small restaurant under the management of one of  his relatives and, while Bankhardt's teacher and the other man were sitting  at a table, some Northern soldiers appeared, one of whom owed the  restaurant keeper a small amount of money. When asked to pay, the soldier  turned upon him and shouted: \"You have been assisting the brigands. I saw  some of them carrying goods into your house.\" Thereupon the soldiers  arrested everyone in the shop.    The police officials were quite ready to release the teacher and the other  man upon our statements, but they would not allow the cook to go. His hands  were kept tightly bound and he was chained to a post by the neck. The  soldier who arrested him was his sole accuser, but of course, others would  appear to uphold him in his charge if it were necessary.    The cook was as innocent as any one of the missionaries, but it required  several hours of work and threats of complaint to the government at Foochow  to prevent the man from being summarily executed.    We were not able to get any mail from Foochow during the rebellion because  the constant stream of Northern soldiers on their way up the river had  paralyzed the entire country to such an extent that all the river men had  fled.    The soldiers were firing for target practice upon every boat they saw on  the river and dozens of men had been killed and then robbed. The Northern  commander told us frankly that this could not be prevented, and when we  announced that we were going to start will all the missionaries down the  river on the following day, he was very much disturbed. He insisted that we  have American flags displayed on our boats to prevent being fired upon by  the soldiers.    Although it had taken eight days to work our way laboriously through the  rapids and up the river from Foochow to Yen-Ping, we covered the same  distance down the river in twenty-four hours and had breakfast with Mr.  Kellogg at his house the morning after we left Yen-Ping. In two days our  equipment was repacked and ready for the trip to Futsing to hunt the blue  tiger.          CHAPTER VI      HUNTING THE \"GREAT INVISIBLE\"    For many years before Mr. Caldwell went to Yen-ping he had been stationed  at the city of Futsing, about thirty miles from Foochow. Much of his work  consisted of itinerant trips during which he visited the various mission  stations under his charge. He almost invariably went on foot from place to  place and carried with him a butterfly net and a rifle, so that to so keen  a naturalist each day's walk was full of interest.    The country was infested with man-eating tigers, and very often the  villagers implored him to rid their neighborhood of some one of the yellow  raiders which had been killing their children, pigs, or cattle. During ten  years he had killed seven tigers in the Futsing region. He often said that  his gun had been just as effective in carrying Christianity to the natives  as had his evangelistic work. Although Mr. Caldwell has been especially  fortunate and has killed his tigers without ever really hunting them,  nevertheless it is a most uncertain sport as we were destined to learn. The  tiger is the \"Great Invisible\"--he is everywhere and nowhere, here today  and gone tomorrow. A sportsman in China may get his shot the first day out  or he may hunt for weeks without ever seeing a tiger even though they are  all about him; and it is this very uncertainty that makes the game all the  more fascinating.    The part of Fukien Province about Futsing includes mountains of  considerable height, many of which are planted with rice and support a  surprising number of Chinese who are grouped in closely connected villages.  While the cultivated valleys afford no cover for tiger and the mountain  slopes themselves are usually more or less denuded of forest, yet the deep  and narrow ravines, choked with sword grass and thorny bramble, offer an  impenetrable retreat in which an animal can sleep during the day without  fear of being disturbed. It is possible for a man to make his way through  these lairs only by means of the paths and tunnels which have been opened  by the tigers themselves.    Mr. Caldwell's usual method of hunting was to lead a goat with one or two  kids to an open place where they could be fastened just outside the edge of  the lair, and then to conceal himself a few feet away. The bleating of the  goats would usually bring the tiger into the open where there would be an  opportunity for a shot in the late afternoon.    Mr. Caldwell's first experience in hunting tigers was with a shotgun at the  village of Lung-tao. His burden-bearers had not arrived with the basket  containing his rifle, and as it was already late in the afternoon, he  suggested to Da-Da, the Chinese boy who was his constant companion, that  they make a preliminary inspection of the lair even though they carried  only shotguns loaded with lead slugs about the size of buckshot.    They tethered a goat just outside the edge of the lair and the tiger  responded to its bleating almost immediately. Caldwell did not see the  animal until it came into the open about fifty yards away and remained in  plain view for almost half an hour. The tiger seemed to suspect danger and  crouched on the terrace, now and then putting his right foot forward a  short distance and drawing it slowly back again. He had approached along a  small trail, but before he could reach the goat it was necessary to cross  an open space a few yards in width, and to do this the animal flattened  himself like a huge striped serpent. His head was extended so that the  throat and chin were touching the ground, and there was absolutely no  motion of the body other than the hips and shoulders as the beast slid  along at an amazingly rapid rate. But at the instant the cat gained the  nearest cover it made three flying leaps and landed at the foot of the  terrace upon which the goat was tied.    \"Just then he saw me,\" said Mr. Caldwell, \"and slowly pushed his great  black-barred face over the edge of the grass not fifteen feet away.    \"I fired point-blank at his head and neck. He leaped into the air with the  blood spurting over the grass, and fell into a heap, but gathered himself  and slid down over the terraces. As he went I fired a second load of slugs  into his hip. He turned about, slowly climbed the hill parallel with us,  and stood looking back at me, his face streaming with blood.    \"I was fumbling in my coat trying to find other shells, but before I could  reload the gun he walked unsteadily into the lair and lay down. It was  already too dark to follow and the next morning a bloody trail showed where  he had gone upward into the grass. Later, in the same afternoon, he was  found dead by some Chinese more than three miles away.\"    During his many experiences with the Futsing tigers Mr. Caldwell has  learned much about their habits and peculiarities, and some of his  observations are given in the following pages.    \"The tiger is by instinct a coward when confronted by his greatest  enemy--man. Bold and daring as he may be when circumstances are in his  favor, he will hurriedly abandon a fresh kill at the first cry of a  shepherd boy attending a flock on the mountain-side and will always weigh  conditions before making an attack. If things do not exactly suit him  nothing will tempt him to charge into the open upon what may appear to be  an isolated and defenseless goat.    \"An experience I had in April, 1910, will illustrate this point. I led a  goat into a ravine where a tiger which had been working havoc among the  herds of the farmers was said to live. This animal only a few days previous  to my hunt had attacked a herd of cows and killed three of them, but on  this occasion the beast must have suspected danger and was exceedingly  cautious. He advanced under cover along a trail until within one hundred  feet of the goat and there stopped to make a survey of the surroundings.  Peering into the valley, he saw two men at a distance of five hundred yards  or more cutting grass and, after watching intently for a time, the great  cat turned and bounded away into the bushes.    \"On another occasion this tiger awaited an opportunity to attack a cow  which a farmer was using in plowing his field. The man had unhitched his  cow and squatted down in the rice paddy to eat his mid-day meal, when the  tiger suddenly rushed from cover and killed the animal only a few yards  behind the peasant. This shows how daring a tiger may be when he is able to  strike from the rear, and when circumstances seem to favor an attack. I  have known tigers to rush at a dog or hog standing inside a Chinese house  where there was the usual confusion of such a dwelling, and in almost every  instance the victim was killed, although it was not always carried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12297"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#9)"],[1,"river, which kept him from  hard labor. Other slaves on the plantation performed such duties as rail  splitting, digging up trees by the roots and other hard work.    Charles Coates remembers vividly the cruelties practiced on the Hall  plantation. His duty was to see that all the slaves reported to work on  time. The bell was rung at 5:30 a.m. by one of the slaves. Charles had  the ringing of the bell for three years; this was in addition to the  carriage driving. He tells with laughter how the slaves would \"grab a  piece of meat and bread and run to the field\" as no time was allowed to  sit and eat breakfast. This was a very different way from that of the  master he had before, as Mr. L'Angle was much better to his slaves.    Mr. Hall was different in many ways from Mr. L'Angle, \"He was always  pretending\" says Charles that he did not want his slaves beaten  unmercifully. Charles being close to Mr. Hall during work hours had  opportunity to see and hear much about what was going on at the  plantation. And he believes that Mr. Hall knew just how the overseer  dealt with the slaves.    On the Hall plantation there was a contraption, similar to a gallows,  where the slaves were suspended and whipped. At the top of this device  were blocks of wood with chains run through holes and high enough that a  slave when tied to the chains by his fingers would barely touch the  ground with his toes. This was done so that the slave could not shout or  twist his body while being whipped. The whipping was prolonged until the  body of the slave covered with welts and blood trickled down his naked  body. Women were treated in the same manner, and a pregnant woman  received no more leniency than did a man. Very often after a severe  flogging a slave's body was treated to a bath of water containing salt  and pepper so that the pain would be more lasting and aggravated. The  whipping was done with sticks and a whip called the \"cat o' nine tails,\"  meaning every lick meant nine. The \"cat o' nine tails\" was a whip of  nine straps attached to a stick; the straps were perforated so that  everywhere the hole in the strap fell on the flesh a blister was left.    The treatment given by the overseer was very terrifying. He relates how  a slave was put in a room and locked up for two and three days at a time  without water or food, because the overseer thought he hadn't done  enough work in a given time.    Another offense which brought forth severe punishment was that of  crossing the road to another plantation. A whipping was given and very  often a slave was put on starvation for a few days.    One privilege given slaves on the plantation was appreciated by all and  that was the opportunity to hear the word of God. The white people  gathered in log and sometimes frame churches and the slaves were  permitted to sit about the church yard on wagons and on the ground and  listen to the preaching. When the slaves wanted to hold church they had  to get special permission from the master, and at that time a slave hut  was used. A white Preacher was called in and he would preach to them not  to steal, lie or run away and \"be sure and git all dem weeds outen dat  corn in de field and your master will think a heap of you.\" Charles does  not remember anything else the preacher told them about God. They  learned more about God when they sat outside the church waiting to drive  their masters and family back home.    Charles relates an incident of a slave named Sambo who thought himself  very smart and who courted the favor of the master. The neighboring  slaves screamed so loudly while being whipped that Sambo told his master  that he knew how to make a contraption which, if a slave was put into  while being whipped would prevent him from making a noise. The device  was made of two blocks of wood cut to fit the head and could be fastened  around the neck tightly. When the head was put in, the upper and lower  parts were clamped together around the neck so that the slave could not  scream. The same effect as choking. The stomach of the victim was placed  over a barrel which allowed freedom of movement. When the lash was  administered and the slave wiggled, the barrel moved.    Now it so happened that Sambo was the first to be put into his own  invention for a whipping. The overseer applied the lash rather heavily,  and Sambo was compelled to wiggle his body to relieve his feelings. In  wiggling the barrel under his stomach rolled a bit straining Sambo's  neck and breaking it. After Sambo died from his neck being broken the  master discontinued the use of the device, as he saw the loss of  property in the death of slaves.    Charles was still a carriage driver when freedom came. He had  opportunity to see and hear many things about the master's private life.  When the news of the advance of the Union Army came, Mr. Hall carried  his money to a secluded spot and buried it in an iron pot so that the  soldiers who were confiscating all the property and money they could,  would not get his money. The slave owners were required to notify the  slaves that they were free so Mr. Hall sent his son Sherard to the  cabins to notify all the slaves to come into his presence and there he  had his son to tell them that they were free. The Union soldiers took  much of the slave owners' property and gave to the slaves telling them  that if the owners' took the property back to write and tell them about  it; the owners only laughed because they knew the slaves could not read  nor write. After the soldiers had gone the timid and scared slaves gave  up most of the land; some few however, fenced in a bit of land while the  soldiers remained in the vicinity and they managed to keep a little of  the land.    Many of the slaves remained with the owners. There they worked for small  monthly wages and took whatever was left of cast off clothing and food  and whatever the \"old missus\" gave them. A pair of old pants of the  master was highly prized by them.    Charles Coates was glad to be free. He had been well taken care of and  looked younger than 37 years of age at the close of slavery. He had not  been married; had been put upon the block twice to be sold after  belonging to Mr. Hall. Each time he was offered for sale, his master  wanted so much for him, and refusing to sell him on time payments, he  was always left on his master's hands. His master said \"being tall,  healthy and robust, he was well worth much money.\"    After slavery, Charles was rated as a good worker. He at once began  working and saving his money and in a short time he had accumulated  \"around $200.\"    The first sight of a certain young woman caused him to fall in love. He  says the love was mutual and after a courtship of three weeks they were  married. The girl's mother told Charles that she had always been very  frail, but he did not know that she had consumption. Within three days  after they were married she died and her death caused much grief for  Charles.    He was reluctant to bury her and wanted to continue to stand and look at  her face. A white doctor and a school teacher whose names he does not  remember, told him to put his wife's body in alcohol to preserve it and  he could look at it all the time. At that time white people who had  plenty of money and wanted to see the faces of their deceased used this  method.    A glass casket was used and the dressed body of the deceased was placed  in alcohol inside the casket. Another casket made of wood held the glass  casket and the whole was placed in a vault made of stone or brick. The  walls of the vault were left about four feet above the ground and a  window and ledge were placed in front, so when the casket was placed  inside of the vault the bereaved could lean upon the ledge and look in  at the face of the deceased. The wooden casket was provided with a glass  top part of the way so that the face could easily be seen.    Although the process of preserving the body in alcohol cost $160,  Charles did not regret the expense saying, \"I had plenty of money at  that time.\"    After the death of his wife, Charles left with his mother and father,  Henrietta and Spencer Coates and went to Savannah, Georgia. He said they  were so glad to go, that they walked to within 30 miles of Savannah,  when they saw a man driving a horse and wagon who picked them up and  carried them into Savannah. It was in that city that he met his present  wife, Irene, and they were married about 1876.    There are nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren living and in  March of 1936, when a party was given in honor of Father Coates' 108th  birthday, one of each of the four generations of his family were  present.    The party was given at the Clara White Mission, 615 West Ashley Street  by Ertha M.M. White. Father Coates and his wife were very much honored  and each spoke encouraging words to those present. On the occasion he  said that the cause for his long life was due to living close to nature,  rising early, going to bed early and not dissipating in any way.    He can \"shout\" (jumping about a foot and a half from the floor and  knocking his heels together.) He does chores about his yard; looks years  younger than he really is and enjoys good health. His hair is partly  white; his memory very good and his chief delight is talking about God  and his goodness. He has preached the gospel in his humble way for a  number of years, thereby gaining the name of \"Father\" Coates.      REFERENCE    1.
