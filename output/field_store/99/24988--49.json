On November 2nd a mob attacked a settlement on Big Blue River.  They unroofed one house and were beating a brother by the name of Bennett,  who was sick in bed, when a party of brethren came to the rescue. There was  some firing of guns between them, and a mobber was wounded in the leg.    On November 4th as a band of mobbers started out to make a raid on the  Saints, word was sent to the brethren, and thirty of them soon gathered to  withstand the mob. A battle ensued in which two of the mobbers were killed.  One of the brethren was so badly wounded that he died the next day. Brother  Philo Dibble was shot and severely wounded, but he was administered to and  soon got well.    The whole country was now aroused. Word was sent broadcast that the  \"Mormons\" had got the Indians to help them, and that they had taken the  town of Independence.    Next morning people flocked into the town and there was great excitement.    And now we must name one of the most cruel and wicked men of that time,  Lilburn W. Boggs. He was lieutenant-governor, which is next to the  governor, the highest officer in the state. Boggs permitted the mob to  organize themselves into a militia and thereby become regular soldiers of  the state. The mob leaders seeing that the Saints had decided to protect  themselves and fight if necessary, raised this militia so that if the  Saints opposed them that they could be classed as law breakers.    The branches of the Church west of Independence having heard that the mob  was going to kill some of the brethren in that town, raised about one  hundred men to go to their rescue. While on the way they heard that there  was no immediate danger, and that the militia had been called out. At this  they were going back to their homes; but just then the militia came up, led  by Colonel Pitcher. He demanded that the \"Mormons\" give up their arms, but  they would not unless the mob, or militia as it was called, would do the  same. This Colonel Pitcher agreed to have done, and then the brethren gave  up their arms, consisting of fifty-nine guns and one pistol.    No sooner was this done than the most awful scene took place. The mob did  not give up a gun, but bands of them roamed over the country searching for  the Saints. Houses were torn down and burned, men were tied up and whipped,  women and children were driven out into the fields and forests. Many of the  county's leading men took part in these crimes, and even ministers,  preachers of the gospel as they called themselves, were seen leading mobs  from place to place.    The cold winter was now coming on, it being the month of November. At one  place a company of one hundred and ninety--all being women and children  excepting three old men--was driven thirty miles across a burnt prairie,  the ground being coated with sleet. Their trail could be easily followed by  the blood which flowed from their feet.    You will see by the map that Clay county lies north of Jackson, just across  the Missouri river. As the Saints were driven from their homes, most of  them made their way to Clay county whose people received them kindly. Soon  the shores of the river were lined with men, women and children, goods,  boxes, wagons, etc; The ferrymen were kept busy taking them over the river.  At night the place had a strange appearance. Hundreds of people could be  seen in every direction; some in tents and some in the open air around the  fires. The rain descended in torrents. Husbands were asking for their wives  and wives for their husbands, parents for children and children for  parents. Some had managed to escape with a little provisions; many had lost  all their goods.    There were at this time about twelve hundred Saints in Jackson county, so  it took many days for them all to get away. Some of the poorest of the  Saints who could not get away at first were driven out during the cold  storms of that winter.    Early next spring when nearly all the Saints had left, the mob set fire to  the deserted homes. One of the brethren reported that two hundred and three  dwellings and one grist mill were destroyed.    Topics.--1. Contrast between present conditions and past. 2. Mobbing  continued. 3.

Pratt and Lyman Wight were sent as  messengers from the Saints in Clay county to Kirtland to tell the Prophet  what had happened and to ask for further advice. Joseph, you may be sure,  was very grieved to hear about the sufferings of the Saints, and he  enquired of the Lord what should be done. In answer, a revelation was given  instructing Joseph to gather the young and middle aged men of the Church  and organize them into a company which was to march to Missouri to bring  aid to the Saints and to assist them to again get possession of their  homes. Five hundred men were to be obtained, but one hundred would do if no  more could be raised.    Accordingly, Joseph and seven other brethren went two and two through the  various branches in the east asking for means and volunteers for this  mission.    New Portage, a village about sixty miles south-west from Kirtland was  selected as a gathering place, and from this point on the 8th of May, 1834,  one hundred and fifty men started for Missouri. They were organized in  regular army order, having officers to see that everything on the march  was done properly. Joseph was the leader.    The distance from Kirtland to Missouri is one thousand miles. That long  journey was not an easy one. The wagons were heavily loaded, and as the  roads were poor there was very little riding. Often the men would have to  help drag the loads over the bad places. Every Sunday the camp rested and  held meetings. Sometimes the people, suspecting they were \"Mormons\" would  annoy them, so that guards had to be placed around the camp. People were  also curious to know what this strange company of men was and where it was  going. Spies followed the company for many miles. There were some boys in  camp, and the inquisitive people thought it an easy matter to find out  everything from the boys.    \"My boy, where are you from?\" they would ask.    \"From the east,\" was the answer.    \"Where are you going?\"    \"To the west.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To see where we can get land cheapest and best.\"    \"Who leads the camp?\"    \"Sometimes one, sometimes another.\"    \"What name?\"    \"Captain Wallace, Major Bruce,\" etc.    The Prophet Joseph believed in being kind to all animals, and he instructed  his brethren in Zion's camp to kill none except for food. Man must first  become peaceful, before animals will lose their fierceness. Not long after  this instruction had been given, a brother became very tired by traveling  and lay down on the ground to sleep. When he awoke, what should he see but  a rattlesnake coiled up not more than a foot away from his head. Just then  some of the brethren came up and wanted to kill the snake; but the brother  said, \"No, I'll protect him, for he and I have had a good nap together.\" He  remembered what Joseph had said.    On June 7th the company having crossed the Mississippi river, camped on  Salt river in Missouri. More of the brethren had joined the company on the  way, and now it numbered two hundred and five men. From this point Parley  P. Pratt and Orson Hyde were sent to Governor Dunklin at Jefferson city,  asking him to use his power as the highest officer in the state to have the  Saints brought back to their homes in Jackson county. The governor said he  thought it right that the Saints should get back their lands, yet he was  afraid if they tried to go back or if he called out soldiers to help them  get their homes, there would be a terrible war and many people killed. So  the governor would do nothing to help them.    While Zion's camp was making its way to the Saints in Clay county, a  meeting was held in Liberty where some mobbers from Jackson county tried to  arouse the people against the Saints. Nothing being done at this meeting, a  party of fifteen men started for Independence to raise an army large enough  to destroy Joseph and the camp.    One of the leaders of this band was James Campbell. As he pushed his  pistols into the holsters before starting, he said with an oath: \"The  eagles and turkey buzzards shall eat my flesh if I do not fix Joe Smith and  his army so that their skins will not hold shucks before two days are  passed!\" As he and his companions were crossing the Missouri river their  boat sank. Seven of them were drowned and among them was Campbell. What was  left of his body was found three weeks after lodged on a pile of drift  wood. The \"eagles and turkey buzzards\" had eaten the flesh from his bones.    On the 19th the camp passed through Richmond. They expected to reach Clay  county that night, but were so greatly hindered by accidents that they  camped for the night between two forks of Fishing river. A large mob had  gathered, bent on destroying the camp. A boat containing forty mobbers had  been sent over the river, when a storm arose. The rain fell in torrents,  the lightning flashed, the thunder shook the earth. Great hail stones  destroyed the corn in the fields and stripped the trees of leaves. The mob  scattered in confusion. The river rose nearly forty feet, which made it  impossible for anyone to cross. The brethren took shelter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#9)"],[1,"way to Rome, and  figured while there, as a personage of no ordinary distinction.    Rome was at this time, as we have said, the great center of education,  as well as of religious and ecclesiastical influence. In fact,  education and religion went hand in hand in those days, there being  scarcely any instruction in books excepting for the purposes of the  Church. Separate schools had been established at Rome by the leading  nations of Europe, where their youth could be taught, each at an  institution in which his own language was spoken. Ethelwolf remained a  year at Rome, to give Alfred the benefit of the advantages which the  city afforded. The boy was of a reflective and thoughtful turn of  mind, and applied himself diligently to the performance of his duties.  His mind was rapidly expanded, his powers were developed, and stores  of such knowledge as was adapted to the circumstances and wants of the  times were laid up. The religious and intellectual influences thus  brought to bear upon the young Alfred's mind produced strong and  decided effects in the formation of his character--effects which were  very strikingly visible in his subsequent career.    Ethelwolf found, when he arrived at Rome, that the Saxon seminary had  been burned the preceding year. It had been founded by a former Saxon  king. Ethelwolf rebuilt it, and placed the institution on a new and  firmer foundation than before. He also obtained some edicts from the  papal government to secure and confirm certain rights of his Saxon  subjects residing in the city, which rights had, it seems, been in  some degree infringed upon, and he thus saved his subjects from  oppressions to which they had been exposed. In a word, Ethelwolf's  visit not only afforded an imposing spectacle to those who witnessed  the pageantry and the ceremonies which marked it, but it was attended  with permanent and substantial benefits to many classes, who became,  in consequence of it, the objects of the pious monarch's benevolent  regard.    At length, when the year had expired, Ethelwolf set out on his return.  He went back through France, as he came, and during his stay in  that country on the way home, an event occurred which was of no  inconsiderable consequence to Alfred himself, and which changed or  modified Ethelwolf's whole destiny. The event was that, having, as  before stated, become enamored with the young Princess Judith, the  daughter of the King of France, Ethelwolf demanded her in marriage.  We have no means of knowing how the proposal affected the princess  herself; marriages in that rank and station in life were then, as they  are now in fact, wholly determined and controlled by great political  considerations, or by the personal predilections of powerful _men_,  with very little regard for the opinions or desires of the party  whose happiness was most to be affected by the result. At all events,  whatever may have been Judith's opinion, the marriage was decided upon  and consummated, and the venerable king returned to England with his  youthful bride. The historians of the day say, what would seem almost  incredible, that she was but about twelve years old.    Judith's Saxon name was Leotheta. She made an excellent mother to the  young Alfred, though she innocently and indirectly caused her husband  much trouble in his realm. Alfred's older brothers were wild and  turbulent men, and one of them, Ethelbald, was disposed to retain  a portion of the power with which he had been invested during his  father's absence, instead of giving it up peaceably on his return. He  organized a rebellion against his father, making the king's course of  conduct in respect to his youthful bride the pretext. Ethelwolf was  very fond of his young wife, and seemed disposed to elevate her to  a position of great political consideration and honor. Ethelbald  complained of this. The father, loving peace rather than war,  compromised the question with him, and relinquished to him a part  of his kingdom. Two years after this he died, leaving Ethelbald the  entire possession of the throne. Ethelbald, as if to complete and  consummate his unnatural conduct toward his father, persuaded the  beautiful Judith, his father's widow, to become his wife, in violation  not only of all laws human and divine, but also of those universal  instincts of propriety which no lapse of time and no changes of  condition can eradicate from the human soul. This second union throws  some light on the question of Judith's action. Since she was willing  to marry her husband's son to _preserve_ the position of a queen, we  may well suppose that she did not object to uniting herself to the  father in order to attain it. Perhaps, however, we ought to consider  that no responsibility whatever, in transactions of this character,  should attach to such a mere child.    During all this time Alfred was passing from his eighth to his twelfth  year. He was a very intelligent and observing boy, and had acquired  much knowledge of the world and a great deal of general information in  the journeys which he had taken with his father, both about England  and also on the Continent, in France and Italy. Judith had taken a  great interest in his progress. She talked with him, she encouraged  his inquiries, she explained to him what he did not understand, and  endeavored in every way to develop and strengthen his mental powers.  Alfred was a favorite, and, as such, was always very much indulged;  but there was a certain conscientiousness and gentleness of spirit  which marked his character even in these early years, and seemed to  defend him from the injurious influences which indulgence and extreme  attention and care often produce. Alfred was considerate, quiet, and  reflective; he improved the privileges which he enjoyed, and did not  abuse the kindness and the favors which every one by whom he was known  lavished upon him.    Alfred was very fond of the Anglo-Saxon poetry which abounded in those  days. The poems were legends, ballads, and tales, which described the  exploits of heroes, and the adventures of pilgrims and wanderers of  all kinds. These poems were to Alfred what Homer's poems were to  Alexander. He loved to listen to them, to hear them recited, and to  commit them to memory. In committing them to memory, he was obliged to  depend upon hearing the poems repeated by others, for he himself could  not read.    And yet he was now twelve years old. It may surprise the reader,  perhaps, to be thus told, after all that has been said of the  attention paid to Alfred's education, and of the progress which he had  made, that he could not even read. But reading, far from being then  considered, as it is now, an essential attainment for all, and one  which we are sure of finding possessed by all who have received any  instruction whatever, was regarded in those days a sort of technical  art, learned only by those who were to make some professional use of  the acquisition. Monks and clerks could always read, but generals,  gentlemen, and kings very seldom. And as they could not read, neither  could they write. They made a rude cross at the end of the writings  which they wished to authenticate instead of signing their names--a  mode which remains to the present day, though it has descended to the  very lowest and humblest classes of society.    In fact, even the upper classes of society could not generally learn  to read in those days, for there were no books. Every thing recorded  was in manuscripts, the characters being written with great labor and  care, usually on parchment, the captions and leading letters being  often splendidly illuminated and adorned by gilded miniatures of  heads, or figures, or landscapes, which enveloped or surrounded them.  Judith had such a manuscript of some Saxon poems. She had learned the  language while in France. One day Alfred was looking at the book,  and admiring the character in which it was written, particularly the  ornamented letters at the headings. Some of his brothers were in the  room, they, of course, being much older than he. Judith said that  either of them might have the book who would first learn to read  it. The older brothers paid little attention to this proposal, but  Alfred's interest was strongly awakened. He immediately sought and  found some one to teach him, and before long he read the volume to  Judith, and claimed it as his own. She rejoiced at his success, and  fulfilled her promise with the greatest pleasure.    Alfred soon acquired, by his Anglo-Saxon studies, a great taste for  books, and had next a strong desire to study the Latin language. The  scholars of the various nations of Europe formed at that time, as, in  fact, they do now, one community, linked together by many ties. They  wrote and spoke the Latin language, that being the only language which  could be understood by them all. In fact, the works which were most  highly valued then by the educated men of all nations, were the poems  and the histories, and other writings produced by the classic authors  of the Roman commonwealth. There were also many works on theology,  on ecclesiastical polity, and on law, of great authority and in high  repute, all written in the Latin tongue. Copies of these works were  made by the monks, in their retreats in abbeys and monasteries, and  learned men spent their lives in perusing them. To explore this field  was not properly a duty incumbent upon a young prince destined to take  a seat upon a throne, but Alfred felt a great desire to undertake  the work. He did not do it, however, for the reason, as he afterward  stated, that there was no one at court at the time who was qualified  to teach him.    Alfred, though he had thus the thoughtful and reflective habits of  a student, was also active, and graceful, and strong in his bodily  development. He excelled in all the athletic recreations of the time,  and was especially famous for his skill, and courage,"]]]
