Some of the modern Western teachers of this philosophy explain matters by  saying that \"God is masquerading as different forms of life, including  Man, in order that he may gain the experience resulting therefrom, for  although He has Infinite and Absolute Wisdom and Knowledge, he lacks the  experience that comes only from actually living the life of the lowly  forms, and therefore He descend thus in order to gain the needed  experience.\" Can you imagine the Absolute, possessed of all possible  Knowledge and Wisdom, feeling the need of such petty \"experience,\" and  living the life of the lowly forms (including Man) in order \"to gain  experience?\" To what Depths do these vain theories of Man drive us?  Another leading Western teacher, who has absorbed the teaching of certain  branches of the Oriental Philosophy, and who possesses the courage of his  convictions, boldly announces that \"You, yourself, are the _totality_ of  being, and with your mind alone create, preserve and destroy the  universe, which is your own mental product.\" And again the last mentioned  teacher states: \"the entire universe is a bagatelle illustration of your  own creative power, which you are now exhibiting for your own  inspection.\" \"By their fruits shall you know them,\" is a safe rule to  apply to all teachings. The philosophy that teaches that the Universe is  an illusion perpetrated by you (God) to amuse, entertain or fool yourself  (God), can have but one result, and that is the conclusion that  \"everything is nothing,\" and all that is necessary to do is to sit down,  fold your hands and enjoy the Divine exhibition of legerdemain that you  are performing for your own entertainment, and then, when the show is  over, return to your state of conscious Godhood and recall with smiles  the pleasant memories of the \"conjure show\" that you created to fool  yourself with during several billions of ages. That is what it amounts  to, and the result is that those accepting this philosophy thrust upon  them by forceful teachers, and knowing in their hearts that they are  _not_ God, but absorbing the suggestions of \"nothingness,\" are driven  into a state of mental apathy and negativeness, the soul sinking into a  stupor from which it may not be roused for a long period of time.    We wish you to avoid confounding our teaching with this just mentioned.  We wish to teach you that You are a real Being--_not_ God Himself, but a  manifestation of Him who is the Absolute. You are a Child of the  Absolute, if you prefer the term, possessed of the Divine Heritage, and  whose mission it is to unfold qualities which are your inheritances from  your Parent. Do not make the great mistake of confounding the Relative  with the Absolute. Avoid this pitfall into which so many have fallen. Do  not allow yourself to fall into the \"Slough of Despond,\" and wallow in  the mud of \"nothingness,\" and to see no reality except in the person of  some forceful teacher who takes the place of the Absolute in your mind.  But raise your head and assert your Divine Parentage, and your Heritage  from the Absolute, and step out boldly on the Path, asserting the \"I.\"    (We must refer the Candidate back to our \"Advanced Course,\" for our  teachings regarding the Absolute and the Relative. The last three lessons  of that course will throw light upon what we have just said To repeat the  teaching at this point would be to use space which is needed for the  lesson before us.)    And yet, while the \"I\" is _not_ God, the Absolute, it is infinitely  greater than we have imagined it to be before the light dawned upon us.  It extends itself far beyond what we had conceived to be its limits. It  touches the Universe at all its points, and is in the closest union with  all of Life. It is in the closest touch with all that has emanated from  the Absolute--all the world of Relativity. And while it faces the  Relative Universe, it has its roots in the Absolute, and draws  nourishment therefrom, just as does the babe in the womb obtain  nourishment from the mother. It is verily a manifestation of God, and  God's very essence is in it. Surely this is almost as \"high\" a statement  as the \"I Am God\" of the teachers just mentioned,--and yet how different.  Let us consider the teaching in detail in this lesson, and in portions of  others to follow.    Let us begin with a consideration of the instruments of the Ego, and the  material with which and through which the Ego works. Let us realize that  the physical body of man is identical in substance with all other forms  of matter, and that its atoms are continually changing and being  replaced, the material being drawn from the great storehouse of matter,  and that there is a Oneness of matter underlying all apparent differences  of form and substance. And then let us realize that the vital energy or  _Prana_ that man uses in his life work is but a portion of that great  universal energy which permeates everything and everywhere, the portion  being used by us at any particular moment being drawn from the universal  supply, and again passing out from us into the great ocean of force or  energy. And then let us realize that even the mind, which is so close to  the real Self that it is often mistaken for it--even that wonderful thing  Thought--is but a portion of the Universal Mind, the highest emanation of  the Absolute beneath the plane of Spirit, and that the Mind--substance or  _Chitta_ that we are using this moment, is not ours separately and  distinctly, but is simply a portion from the great universal supply,  which is constant and unchangeable. Let us then realize that even this  thing that we feel pulsing within us--that which is so closely bound up  with the Spirit as to be almost inseparable from it--that which we call  Life--is but a bit of that Great Life Principle that pervades the  Universe, and which cannot be added to, nor subtracted from. When we have  realized these things, and have begun to feel our relation (in these  particulars) to the One Great Emanation of the Absolute, then we may  begin to grasp the idea of the Oneness of Spirit, and the relation of the  \"I\" to every other \"I,\" and the merging of the Self into the one great  Self, which is not the extinction of Individuality, as some have  supposed, but the enlargement and extension of the Individual  Consciousness until it takes in the Whole.    In Lessons X and XI, of the \"Advanced Course\" we called your attention to  the Yogi teachings concerning _Akasa_ or Matter, and showed you that all  forms of what we know as Matter are but different forms of manifestation  of the principle called _Akasa_, or as the Western scientists call it,  \"Ether.\" This Ether or _Akasa_ is the finest, thinnest and most tenuous  form of Matter, in fact it is Matter in its ultimate or fundamental form,  the different forms of what we call Matter being but manifestations of  this _Akasa_ or Ether, the apparent difference resulting from different  rates of vibration, etc. We mention this fact here merely to bring  clearly before your mind the fact of the Universality of Matter, to the  end that you may realize that each and every particle of your physical  body is but a portion of this great principle of the Universe, fresh from  the great store-house, and just about returning to it again, for the  atoms of the body are constantly changing. That which appears as your  flesh to-day, may have been part of a plant a few days before, and may be  part of some other living thing a few days hence. Constant change is  going on, and what is yours to-day was someone's else yesterday, and  still another's to-morrow. You do not own one atom of matter  _personally_, it is all a part of the common supply, the stream flowing  through you and through all Life, on and on forever.    And so it is with the Vital Energy that you are using every moment of  your life. You are constantly drawing upon the great Universal supply of  _Prana_, then using what is given you, allowing the force to pass on to  assume some other form. It is the property of all, and all you can do is  to use what you need, and allow it to pass on. There is but one Force or  Energy, and that is to be found everywhere at all times.    And even the great principle, Mind-substance, is under the same law. It  is hard for us to realize this. We are so apt to think of our mental  operations as distinctively our own--something that belongs to us  personally--that it is difficult for us to realize that Mind-substance is  a Universal principle just as Matter or Energy, and that we are but  drawing upon the Universal supply in our mental operations. And more than  this, the particular portion of Mind-substance that we are using,  although separated from the Mind-substance used by other individuals by a  thin wall of the very finest kind of Matter, is really in touch with the  other apparently separated minds, and with the Universal Mind of which it  forms a part. Just as is the Matter of which our physical bodies are  composed really in touch with all Matter; and just as is the Vital Force  used by us really in touch with all Energy; so is our Mind-substance  really in touch with all Mind-substance. It is as if the Ego in its  progress were moving through great oceans of Matter, Energy, or  Mind-substance, making use of that of each which it needed and which  immediately surrounded it, and leaving each behind as it moved on through  the great volume of the ocean. This illustration is clumsy, but it may  bring to your consciousness a realization that the Ego is the only thing  that is really _Yours_, unchangeable and unaltered, and that all the rest  is merely that portion of the Universal supply that you draw to yourself  for the wants of the moment. It may also bring more clearly before your  mind the great Unity of things--may enable you to see things as a Whole,  rather than as separated parts.

Mine was dirt by the side of it. For the first minute I  could almost have cried; but I prayed for a better spirit, and presently  I was able to enjoy them, and thank God for those lovely works, and  for those skilful, patient craftsmen, whom I own my masters. Well, the  coloured work was so beautiful I forgot all about the black and white.  But next day, when all the other prizes had been given, they came to the  writing, and whose name think you was called first?\"    \"Yours,\" said Kate.    The others laughed her to scorn.    \"You may well laugh,\" said Gerard, \"but for all that, Gerard Eliassoen  of Tergou was the name the herald shouted. I stood stupid; they thrust  me forward. Everything swam before my eyes. I found myself kneeling on  a cushion at the feet of the Duke. He said something to me, but I was so  fluttered I could not answer him. So then he put his hand to his side,  and did not draw a glaive and cut off my dull head, but gave me a gold  medal, and there it is.\" There was a yell and almost a scramble. \"And  then he gave me fifteen great bright golden angels. I had seen one  before, but I never handled one. Here they are.\"    \"Oh, Gerard! oh, Gerard!\"    \"There is one for you, our eldest; and one for you, Sybrandt, and for  you, Little Mischief; and two for thee, Little Lily, because God hath  afflicted thee; and one for myself, to buy colours and vellum; and nine  for her that nursed us all, and risked the two crowns upon poor Gerard's  hand.\"    The gold drew out their characters. Cornelis and Sybrandt clutched each  his coin with one glare of greediness and another glare of envy at Kate,  who had got two pieces. Giles seized his and rolled it along the floor  and gambolled after it. Kate put down her crutches and sat down, and  held out her little arms to Gerard with a heavenly gesture of love and  tenderness; and the mother, fairly benumbed at first by the shower of  gold that fell on her apron, now cried out, \"Leave kissing him, Kate;  he is my son, not yours. Ah. Gerard! my boy! I have not loved you as you  deserved.\"    Then Gerard threw himself on his knees beside her, and she flung her  arms round him and wept for joy and pride upon his neck.    \"Good lad! good lad!\" cried the hosier, with some emotion. \"I must go  and tell the neighbours. Lend me the medal, Gerard; I'll show it my good  friend Peter Buyskens; he is ever regaling me with how his son Jorian  won the tin mug a shooting at the butts.\"    \"Ay, do, my man; and show Peter Buyskens one of the angels. Tell him  there are fourteen more where that came from. Mind you bring it me  back!\"    \"Stay a minute, father; there is better news behind,\" said Gerard,  flushing with joy at the joy he caused.    \"Better! better than this?\"    Then Gerard told his interview with the Countess, and the house rang  with joy.    \"Now, God bless the good lady, and bless the dame Van Eyck! A benefice?  our son! My cares are at an end. Eli, my good friend and master, now we  two can die happy whenever our time comes. This dear boy will take our  place, and none of these loved ones will want a home or a friend.\"    From that hour Gerard was looked upon as the stay of the family. He  was a son apart, but in another sense. He was always in the right, and  nothing too good for him. Cornelis and Sybrandt became more and more  jealous of him, and longed for the day he should go to his benefice;  they would get rid of the favourite, and his reverence's purse would be  open to them. With these views he co-operated. The wound love had  given him throbbed duller and duller. His success and the affection and  admiration of his parents made him think more highly of himself, and  resent with more spirit Margaret's ingratitude and discourtesy. For all  that, she had power to cool him towards the rest of her sex, and now for  every reason he wished to be ordained priest as soon as he could pass  the intermediate orders. He knew the Vulgate already better than most of  the clergy, and studied the rubric and the dogmas of the Church with  his friends the monks; and, the first time the bishop came that way, he  applied to be admitted \"exorcist,\" the third step in holy orders. The  bishop questioned him, and ordained him at once. He had to kneel, and,  after a short prayer, the bishop delivered to him a little MS. full of  exorcisms, and said: \"Take this, Gerard, and have power to lay hands  on the possessed, whether baptized or catechumens!\" and he took it  reverently, and went home invested by the Church with power to cast out  demons.    Returning home from the church, he was met by little Kate on her  crutches.    \"Oh, Gerard! who, think you, hath sent to our house seeking you?--the  burgomaster himself.\"    \"Ghysbrecht Van Swieten! What would he with me?\"    \"Nay, Gerard, I know not. But he seems urgent to see you. You are to go  to his house on the instant.\"    \"Well, he is the burgomaster: I will go; but it likes me not. Kate, I  have seen him cast such a look on me as no friend casts. No matter; such  looks forewarn the wise. To be sure, he knows.\"    \"Knows what, Gerard?\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"Nothing?\"    \"Kate, I'll go.\"        CHAPTER V    Ghysbrecht Van Swieten was an artful man. He opened on the novice with  something quite wide of the mark he was really aiming at. \"The town  records,\" said he, \"are crabbedly written, and the ink rusty with age.\"  He offered Gerard the honour of transcribing them fair.    Gerard inquired what he was to be paid.    Ghysbrecht offered a sum that would have just purchased the pens, ink,  and parchment.    \"But, burgomaster, my labour? Here is a year's work.\"    \"Your labour? Call you marking parchment labour? Little sweat goes to  that, I trow.\"    \"'Tis labour, and skilled labour to boot; and that is better paid in all  crafts than rude labour, sweat or no sweat. Besides, there's my time.\"    \"Your time? Why, what is time to you, at two-and-twenty?\" Then fixing  his eyes keenly on Gerard, to mark the effect of his words, he said:  \"Say, rather, you are idle grown. You are in love. Your body is with  these chanting monks, but your heart is with Peter Brandt and his  red-haired girl.\"    \"I know no Peter Brandt.\"    This denial confirmed Ghysbrecht's suspicion that the caster-out of  demons was playing a deep game.    \"Ye lie!\" he shouted. \"Did I not find you at her elbow on the road to  Rotterdam?\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Ah! And you were seen at Sevenbergen but t'other day.\"    \"Was I?'    \"Ah and at Peter's house.\"    \"At Sevenbergen?\"    \"Ay, at Sevenbergen.\"    Now, this was what in modern days is called a draw. It was a guess, put  boldly forth as fact, to elicit by the young man's answer whether he had  been there lately or not.    The result of the artifice surprised the crafty one. Gerard started up  in a strange state of nervous excitement.    \"Burgomaster,\" said he, with trembling voice, \"I have not been at  Sevenbergen these three years, and I know not the name of those you saw  me with, nor where they dwelt; but, as my time is precious, though  you value it not, give you good day.\" And he darted out, with his eyes  sparkling.    Ghysbrecht started up in huge ire; but he sank into his chair again.    \"He fears me not. He knows something, if not all.\"    Then he called hastily to his trusty servant, and almost dragged him to  a window.    \"See you yon man?\" he cried. \"Haste! follow him! But let him not see  you. He is young, but old in craft. Keep him in sight all day. Let me  know whither he goes, and what he does.\"    It was night when the servant returned.    \"Well? well?\" cried Van Swieten eagerly.    \"Master, the young man went from you to Sevenbergen.\"    Ghysbrecht groaned.    \"To the house of Peter the Magician.\"        CHAPTER VI    \"Look into your own heart and write!\" said Herr Cant; and earth's  cuckoos echoed the cry. Look into the Rhine where it is deepest, and the  Thames where it is thickest, and paint the bottom. Lower a bucket into  a well of self-deception, and what comes up must be immortal truth,  mustn't it? Now, in the first place, no son of Adam ever reads his own  heart at all, except by the habit acquired, and the light gained, from  some years perusal of other hearts; and even then, with his acquired  sagacity and reflected light, he can but spell and decipher his own  heart, not read it fluently. Half way to Sevenbergen Gerard looked into  his own heart, and asked it why he was going to Sevenbergen. His heart  replied without a moment's hesitation, \"We are going out of curiosity  to know why she jilted us, and to show her it has not broken our hearts,  and that we are quite content with our honours and our benefice in  prospectu, and don't want her nor ally of her fickle sex.\"    He soon found out Peter Brandt's cottage; and there sat a girl in the  doorway, plying her needle, and a stalwart figure leaned on a long bow  and talked to her. Gerard felt an unaccountable pang at the sight of  him. However, the man turned out to be past fifty years of age, an old  soldier, whom Gerard remembered to have seen shoot at the butts with  admirable force and skill. Another minute and the youth stood before  them. Margaret looked up and dropped her work, and uttered a faint cry,  and was white and red by turns. But these signs of emotion were swiftly  dismissed, and she turned far more chill and indifferent than she would  if she had not betrayed this agitation.    \"What! is it you, Master Gerard? What on earth brings you here, I  wonder?\"    \"I was passing by and saw you; so I thought I would give you good day,  and ask after your father.\"    \"My father is well. He will be here anon.\"    \"Then I may as well stay till he comes.\"    \"As you will. Good Martin, step "]]]
