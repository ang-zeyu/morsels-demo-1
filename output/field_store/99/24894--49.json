[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14657"],[0,"Philo-Jud√¶us of Alexandria (#9)"],[1,"most distinguished member of the Alexandrian community, was  called upon to defend his people, and that part of his works which  Eusebius calls [Greek: Hypotheticha]; _i.e._ apologetics, was probably  written in reply to the Stoic attacks. The hatred of the Stoics was a  religious hatred, which is the bitterest of all; the Stoics were the  propagators of a rival religious system, which had originally been  founded by Hellenized Semites and borrowed much from Semitic sources.  They had their missionaries everywhere and aspired to found a  universal philosophical religion. In their proselytizing activity they  tried to assimilate to their pantheism the mythological religion of  the masses, and thus they became the philosophical supporters of  idolatry. Their greatest religious opponents were the Jews, who not  only refused to accept their teachings, but preached to the nations a  transcendental monotheism against their impersonal and accommodating  pantheism, and a divinely-revealed law of conduct against their vague  natural reason. In the Stoic pantheism the first stand of the pagan  national deities was made against the God of Israel, and at Alexandria  during the first century the fight waxed fierce. It was a fight of  ideas in which persons only were victims, but at the back of the  intermittent persecutions of which we have record we may always  surmise the influence of the Stoic anti-Semites. The war of words  translated itself from time to time into the breaking of heads.    Philo, indeed, never mentions Apion by name, but he refers covertly in  many places to his insolence and unscrupulousness.[74] Josephus wrote  a famous reply to his attacks, refuting \"his vulgar abuse, gross  ignorance and demagogic claptrap,\"[75] and the fact that a Palestinian  Jew thought this apology necessary, proves the wide dissemination of  the poison. The disgrace and death of Sejanus seem to have brought a  relief from actual persecution to the Alexandrian Jews; but the  ill-will between the two races in the city smouldered on, and it only  required a weakening of the controlling hand at Rome to set the  passions aflame again. Right through Philo's treatise \"On the  Confusion of Tongues,\" we can trace the tension. As soon as Gaius,  surnamed Caligula, came to the imperial chair, the opportunity of the  anti-Semites returned. Gaius, after reigning well a few months, fell  ill, was seized with madness, and proved how much evil can be done in  a short space by an imbecile autocrat. Flaccus, the governor of Egypt,  who had hitherto ruled fairly, hoping to ingratiate himself by  misrule, allowed himself to be led by worthless minions, who, from  motives of private greed, desired a riot at Alexandria; he was won  over by the anti-Semites and gave the mob a free hand in their attacks  upon the \"alien Jews.\"[76] The arrival of Agrippa, the grandson of  Herod, who was on his way to his kingdom of Palestine, which the  capricious emperor had just conferred upon him, excited the ill-will  of the Alexandrian mob. Flaccus looked on while the people attacked  the Jewish quarters, sacked the houses, and assailed everyone that  came within their reach. The most distinguished Jews were not spared,  and thirty members of the Council of Elders were dragged to the  marketplace and scourged. Philo's account gives a picture strikingly  similar to that of a modern pogrom. The brutal indifference of Flaccus  did not indeed avail to ingratiate him with the emperor, and he was  recalled to Italy, exiled, and afterwards executed.    The recall of Flaccus did not, however, put an end to the troubles;  the mob had got out of hand, the anti-Semitic demagogues were elated,  and a fresh opportunity for outrage soon presented itself. The mad  emperor, having exhausted ordinary human follies, went on to imagine  himself first a god and then the Supreme God, and finally ordered his  image to be set up in every temple throughout his dominion. The Jews  could not obey the order, and the mob rushed into fresh excesses upon  them, defiled the synagogues with images of the lunatic, and in the  great synagogue itself set up a bronze statue of him, inscribed with  the name of Jupiter. With bitterness Philo points out that it was easy  enough for the vile Egyptians, who worshipped reptiles and beasts, to  erect a statue of the emperor in their temples; for the Jews, with  their lofty idea of God, it was impossible. Against the attack upon  their liberty of conscience they appealed directly to Gaius. An  embassy was sent to lay their case before him, and Philo went to Italy  at the head of the embassy. \"He who is learned, gentle, and modest,  and who is beloved of men, he shall be leader in the city.\" So said  one of the rabbis of old, and the maxim is especially appropriate to  Philo, who in name and deed was \"beloved of men.\" Philo has left us a  very full account of his mission, so that this incident of his life is  a patch of bright light, which stands out almost glaringly from the  general shadow. The account is not merely, nor, indeed, entirely  history. Looking always for a sermon or a subject for a philosophical  lesson, Philo has tricked out the record of the facts with much  moralizing observation on the general lot of mankind, and elaborated  the part of Providence more in the spirit of religious romance than of  scientific history. Yet the main facts are clear. Philo prepared a  long philosophical \"apologia\" for the Jews and set out with five  colleagues for Italy. Nor were the enemies of the Jews remiss; and  Apion, the Alexandrian anti-Semite, was sent at the head of a hostile  deputation. The emperor, Gaius, was in one of his most flippant moods  and little inclined to listen to philosophical or literary  disquisitions. At first he received the Jewish deputation in a  friendly way, and led them to think that he was favorable; but when  they came to plead their cause, they had a rude awakening. Philo, who  was not likely to appreciate the bitter humor of the situation,  tells[77] with gravity that he expected that the emperor would hear  the two contending parties in all proper judicial form, but that in  fact he behaved like an insolent, overbearing tyrant. The audience--if  it can be so called--took place in the gardens of the palace, and the  emperor dragged the unfortunate deputation after him about the place,  while he gave orders to his gardeners, builders, and workmen. Whenever  they tried to put forward their arguments, he would rush ahead,  enjoying the fright and dismay of his helpless victims. At times he  would stop to make some ribald and jeering remark, as, \"Why don't you  eat pork, you fools?\" at which the Egyptians following loudly  applauded. Philo and his comrades, half-dead with agony, could only  pray; and in response to the prayer, says our moralizing chronicler,  the emperor's heart was turned to pity, so that he dismissed them  without giving any hostile answer. According to Josephus, he drove  them away in a passion, and Philo had to cheer his companions by  assuring them of the Divine aid.[78]    The affair was a pathetic farce, and the Jewish actors in it had a  sorry time. The people about the palace, taking their lead from the  emperor, treated them as clowns, and hissed and mocked them, and even  beat them. The scene is somewhat revolting when one conjures up the  picture of the aged Jewish philosopher being roughly handled by the  set of ruffians and impudent slaves who surrounded a Roman emperor.  Happily Gaius jeered once too often in his mad life. One Chaerea, a  Roman of position, nursed an insult of the emperor, and stabbed him  shortly after these events; and the world had the respite of a  tolerably sane emperor before the crowning horror of Nero was let  loose upon it.    The murder of the capricious tyrant released not only the Jews of  Alexandria, but also the Jews of Palestine, from the burden of fear  for their religion. The order had been given to set up a bronze statue  of the emperor in the temple; the Roman governor Petronius was averse  to obeying the edict, but the emperor insisted. King Agrippa, who had  been but lately advanced by him to the kingdom of Judaea, interceded  zealously on behalf of his people. Philo gives us an account of this  appeal by the Jewish king,[79] which recalls at every turn the scenes  of the book of Esther. We have again the fasting, the banquet, the  emperor's request, the appeal of the royal favorite for his people.  One higher critic, indeed, has been found to suggest that the Biblical  book really relates Agrippa's intercession at Rome disguised in the  setting of a Persian story. Agrippa secured for a short time the  rescission of the fateful decree, but the capricious madman soon  returned to his old frame of mind, and ordered his image to be set up  immediately. Had not his death intervened, there would certainly have  been rebellion in Palestine. As it was, the great revolt was postponed  for thirty years. For a little the Jews prevailed over their  adversaries; the anti-Semitic influences were put down in Judaea and  in Alexandria, and in both places \"there was light and joy and  gladness for the Jews.\" Their political privileges were reaffirmed by  imperial decree, and Philo's brother Alexander, who had been  imprisoned, was restored to honor.[80] \"It is fitting,\" ran the  rescript of Claudius, \"to permit the Jews everywhere under our sway to  observe their ancient customs without hindrance. And I charge them to  use my indulgence with moderation, and not to show contempt for the  religious rites of other peoples.\"    The note of triumph rings through the political references to be found  in the last parts of Philo's allegorical commentary, and no doubt it  was accentuated in the lost book which he added as an epilogue, or  palinode, to his history of the embassy.

These he wore on  alternate days. He wore them in a way of his own--well back from his  forehead, so as not to hide his hair, and with the peak behind. The  peak made a sort of half-moon over the back of his collar. Through a  fault of his tailor, there was a yawning gap between the back of his  collar and the collar of his coat. Whenever he shook his head, the  peak of his cap had the look of a live thing trying to investigate  this abyss. Dimly aware of the effect, Albert Grapp shook his head as  seldom as possible.    On wet days he wore a mackintosh. This, as he did not yet possess a  great-coat, he wore also, but with less glory, on cold days. He had  hoped there might be rain on Christmas morning. But there was no rain.  \"Like my luck,\" he said as he came out of his lodgings and turned  his steps to that corner of Jubilee Avenue from which the  Hanbridge-Bursley trams start every half-hour.    Since Jos Wrackgarth had introduced him to his sister at the Hanbridge  Oddfellows' Biennial Hop, when he danced two quadrilles with her, he  had seen her but once. He had nodded to her, Five Towns fashion, and  she had nodded back at him, but with a look that seemed to say \"You  needn't nod next time you see me. I can get along well enough without  your nods.\" A frightening girl! And yet her brother had since told him  she seemed \"a bit gone, like\" on him. Impossible! He, Albert Grapp,  make an impression on the brilliant Miss Wrackgarth! Yet she had sent  him a verbal invite to spend Christmas in her own home. And the time  had come. He was on his way. Incredible that he should arrive! The  tram must surely overturn, or be struck by lightning. And yet no! He  arrived safely.    The small servant who opened the door gave him another verbal message  from Miss Wrackgarth. It was that he must wipe his feet \"well\" on the  mat. In obeying this order he experienced a thrill of satisfaction  he could not account for. He must have stood shuffling his boots  vigorously for a full minute. This, he told himself, was life. He,  Albert Grapp, was alive. And the world was full of other men, all  alive; and yet, because they were not doing Miss Wrackgarth's bidding,  none of them really lived. He was filled with a vague melancholy. But  his melancholy pleased him.    In the parlour he found Jos awaiting him. The table was laid for  three.    \"So you're here, are you?\" said the host, using the Five Towns  formula. \"Emily's in the kitchen,\" he added. \"Happen she'll be here  directly.\"    \"I hope she's tol-lol-ish?\" asked Albert.    \"She is,\" said Jos. \"But don't you go saying that to her. She doesn't  care about society airs and graces. You'll make no headway if you  aren't blunt.\"    \"Oh, right you are,\" said Albert, with the air of a man who knew his  way about.    A moment later Emily joined them, still wearing her kitchen apron. \"So  you're here, are you?\" she said, but did not shake hands. The servant  had followed her in with the tray, and the next few seconds were  occupied in the disposal of the beef and trimmings.    The meal began, Emily carving. The main thought of a man less  infatuated than Albert Grapp would have been \"This girl can't cook.  And she'll never learn to.\" The beef, instead of being red and brown,  was pink and white. Uneatable beef! And yet he relished it more than  anything he had ever tasted. This beef was her own handiwork. Thus  it was because she had made it so.... He warily refrained from  complimenting her, but the idea of a second helping obsessed him.    \"Happen I could do with a bit more, like,\" he said.    Emily hacked off the bit more and jerked it on to the plate he had  held out to her.    \"Thanks,\" he said; and then, as Emily's lip curled, and Jos gave him  a warning kick under the table, he tried to look as if he had said  nothing.    Only when the second course came on did he suspect that the meal was a  calculated protest against his presence. This a Christmas pudding? The  litter of fractured earthenware was hardly held together by the suet  and raisins. All his pride of manhood--and there was plenty of pride  mixed up with Albert Grapp's humility--dictated a refusal to touch  that pudding. Yet he soon found himself touching it, though gingerly,  with his spoon and fork.    In the matter of dealing with scruts there are two schools--the old  and the new. The old school pushes its head well over its plate and  drops the scrut straight from its mouth. The new school emits the  scrut into the fingers of its left hand and therewith deposits it on  the rim of the plate. Albert noticed that Emily was of the new school.  But might she not despise as affectation in him what came natural to  herself? On the other hand, if he showed himself as a prop of the old  school, might she not set her face the more stringently against him?  The chances were that whichever course he took would be the wrong one.    It was then that he had an inspiration--an idea of the sort that comes  to a man once in his life and finds him, likely as not, unable to put  it into practice. Albert was not sure he could consummate this idea of  his. He had indisputably fine teeth--\"a proper mouthful of grinders\"  in local phrase. But would they stand the strain he was going to  impose on them? He could but try them. Without a sign of nervousness  he raised his spoon, with one scrut in it, to his mouth. This scrut he  put between two of his left-side molars, bit hard on it, and--eternity  of that moment!--felt it and heard it snap in two. Emily also heard  it. He was conscious that at sound of the percussion she started  forward and stared at him. But he did not look at her. Calmly,  systematically, with gradually diminishing crackles, he reduced that  scrut to powder, and washed the powder down with a sip of beer. While  he dealt with the second scrut he talked to Jos about the Borough  Council's proposal to erect an electric power-station on the site of  the old gas-works down Hillport way. He was aware of a slight abrasion  inside his left cheek. No matter. He must be more careful. There were  six scruts still to be negotiated. He knew that what he was doing was  a thing grandiose, unique, epical; a history-making thing; a thing  that would outlive marble and the gilded monuments of princes. Yet he  kept his head. He did not hurry, nor did he dawdle. Scrut by scrut,  he ground slowly but he ground exceeding small. And while he did so  he talked wisely and well. He passed from the power-station to a  first edition of Leconte de Lisle's \"Parnasse Contemporain\" that he  had picked up for sixpence in Liverpool, and thence to the Midland's  proposal to drive a tunnel under the Knype Canal so as to link up the  main-line with the Critchworth and Suddleford loop-line. Jos was too  amazed to put in a word. Jos sat merely gaping--a gape that merged by  imperceptible degrees into a grin. Presently he ceased to watch his  guest. He sat watching his sister.    Not once did Albert himself glance in her direction. She was just  a dim silhouette on the outskirts of his vision. But there she was,  unmoving, and he could feel the fixture of her unseen eyes. The time  was at hand when he would have to meet those eyes. Would he flinch?  Was he master of himself?    The last scrut was powder. No temporising! He jerked his glass to his  mouth. A moment later, holding out his plate to her, he looked Emily  full in the eyes. They were Emily's eyes, but not hers alone. They  were collective eyes--that was it! They were the eyes of stark,  staring womanhood. Her face had been dead white, but now suddenly  up from her throat, over her cheeks, through the down between her  eyebrows, went a rush of colour, up over her temples, through the very  parting of her hair.    \"Happen,\" he said without a quaver in his voice, \"I'll have a bit  more, like.\"    She flung her arms forward on the table and buried her face in them.  It was a gesture wild and meek. It was the gesture foreseen and yet  incredible. It was recondite, inexplicable, and yet obvious. It was  the only thing to be done--and yet, by gum, she had done it.    Her brother had risen from his seat and was now at the door. \"Think  I'll step round to the Works,\" he said, \"and see if they banked up  that furnace aright.\"        NOTE.--_The author has in preparation a series of volumes      dealing with the life of Albert and Emily Grapp._          ENDEAVOUR    _By_    J*HN G*LSW*RTHY      The dawn of Christmas Day found London laid out in a shroud of snow.  Like a body wasted by diseases that had triumphed over it at last,  London lay stark and still now, beneath a sky that was as the closed  leaden shell of a coffin. It was what is called an old-fashioned  Christmas.    Nothing seemed to be moving except the Thames, whose embanked waters  flowed on sullenly in their eternal act of escape to the sea. All  along the wan stretch of Cheyne Walk the thin trees stood exanimate,  with not a breath of wind to stir the snow that pied their  soot-blackened branches. Here and there on the muffled ground lay a  sparrow that had been frozen in the night, its little claws sticking  up heavenward. But here and there also those tinier adventurers of the  London air, smuts, floated vaguely and came to rest on the snow--signs  that in the seeming death of civilisation some housemaids at least  survived, and some fires had been lit.    One of these fires, crackling in the grate of one of those  dining-rooms which look fondly out on the river and tolerantly across  to Battersea, was being watched by the critical eye of an aged  canary. The cage in which this bird sat was hung in the middle of  the bow-window. It contained three perches, and also a pendent hoop.  The tray that was its floor had just been cleaned and sanded. In  the embrasure to the right was a fresh supply of hemp-seed; in the  embrasure to the left the bath-tub had just been refilled with"]]]
