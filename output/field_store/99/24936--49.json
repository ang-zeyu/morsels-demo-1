Now erase the extreme ends of the spiral near circles 1 and 5, and  deviate from the original spiral and follow the circles in a more  parallel direction so as to allow the spiral to begin and end gradually  and not too abruptly. Refer to the lower diagram for this.    8. Cut out portions of wood between the bands previously marked around,  as shown in the lower figure. The wood should be cut out with a knife so  as to leave the corners sharp on the narrow bands. The portion cut out  should be a semi-circle and can be sanded by making a spindle a little  smaller than the distance between the bands and fastening sandpaper on  the spindle. Place in the lathe and hold the spiral on the sandpaper  cylinder at an angle so that the spiral will fit. Turn gradually and the  sandpaper will smooth up the portion between the bands and true it up.  At the ends where the grooves are smaller, use a smaller stick around  which sandpaper has been wound and work out by hand.    9. It is well to cut straight down, about 1/32\" deep, along the lines  marking out the narrow bands. Then the wood will not be so likely to  split while removing the stock which forms the grooves between the  bands.    10. Cut out the mortises in the square portions which have been left at  both ends. Make the frame work for the sides and cane. Glue together and  polish.    Note:--By making the posts smaller and using the same construction for a  side a nice looking book stall may be made. The proportions for the  posts are the same as mentioned in Step 3.

FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR DON'T WASTE IT        \"_To provide adequate supplies for the coming year is of absolutely  vital importance to the conduct of the war, and without a very  conscientious elimination of waste and very strict economy in our food  consumption, we cannot hope to fulfill this primary duty._\"    _WOODROW WILSON._          [Illustration]    SAVE SUGAR    _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE SUGAR WITH PRACTICAL  RECIPES FOR SUGARLESS DESSERTS, CAKES, CANDIES AND PRESERVES._      One ounce of sugar less per person, per day, is all our Government  asks of us to meet the world sugar shortage. One ounce of sugar equals  two scant level tablespoonfuls and represents a saving that every man,  woman and child should be able to make. Giving up soft drinks and the  frosting on our cakes, the use of sugarless desserts and confections,  careful measuring and thorough stirring of that which we place in our  cups of tea and coffee, and the use of syrup, molasses or honey on our  pancakes and fritters will more than effect this saving.    It seems but a small sacrifice, if sacrifice it can be called, when  one recognizes that cutting down sugar consumption will be most  beneficial to national health. The United States is the largest  consumer of sugar in the world. In 1916 Germany's consumption was 20  lbs. per person per year, Italy's 29 to 30 lbs., that of France 37,  of England 40, while the United States averaged 85 lbs. This enormous  consumption is due to the fact that we are a nation of candy-eaters.  We spend annually $80,000,000 on confections. These are usually eaten  between meals, causing digestive disturbances as well as unwarranted  expense. Sweets are a food and should be eaten at the close of the  meal, and if this custom is established during the war, not only  will tons of sugar be available for our Allies, but the health of the  nation improved.    The average daily consumption of sugar per person in this country is 5  ounces, and yet nutritional experts agree that not more than 3 ounces  a day should be taken. The giving up of one ounce per day will,  therefore, be of great value in reducing many prevalent American  ailments. Flatulent dyspepsia, rheumatism, diabetes, and stomach  acidity are only too frequently traced to an oversupply of sugar in  our daily diet.    Most persons apparently think of sugar merely as a sweetening agent,  forgetting entirely the fact that it is a most concentrated food.  It belongs to what is called the carbohydrate group, upon which we  largely depend for energy and heat. It is especially valuable to  the person doing active physical work, the open-air worker, or the  healthy, active, growing child, but should be used sparingly by other  classes of people. Sugar is not only the most concentrated fuel food  in the dietary, but it is one that is very readily utilized in the  body, 98 per cent. of it being available for absorption, while within  thirty minutes of the time it is taken into the system part of it is  available for energy.    As a food it must be supplied, especially to the classes of people  mentioned above, but as a confection it can well be curtailed. When it  is difficult to obtain, housekeepers must avail themselves of changed  recipes and different combinations to supply the necessary three  ounces per day and to gain the much-desired sweet taste so necessary  to many of our foods of neutral flavor with which sugar is usually  combined.    Our grandmothers knew how to prepare many dishes without sugar. In  their day lack of transportation facilities, of refining methods and  various economic factors made molasses, sorghum, honey, etc., the  only common methods of sweetening. But the housekeeper of to-day knows  little of sweetening mediums except sugar, and sugar shortage is to  her a crucial problem. There are many ways, however, of getting around  sugar shortage and many methods of supplying the necessary food value  and sweetening.    By the use of marmalades, jams and jellies canned during the season  when the sugar supply was less limited, necessity for the use of sugar  can be vastly reduced. By the addition to desserts and cereals of  dried fruits, raisins, dates, prunes and figs, which contain large  amounts of natural sugar, the sugar consumption can be greatly  lessened. By utilizing leftover syrup from canned or preserved fruits  for sweetening other fruits, and by the use of honey, molasses, maple  sugar, maple syrup and corn syrup, large quantities of sugar may be  saved. The substitution of sweetened condensed milk for dairy milk  in tea, coffee and cocoa--in fact, in all our cooking processes where  milk is required--will also immeasurably aid in sugar conservation.  The substitutes mentioned are all available in large amounts. Honey  is especially valuable for children, as it consists of the more simple  sugars which are less irritating than cane sugar, and there is no  danger of acid stomach from the amounts generally consumed.    As desserts are the chief factor in the use of quantities of sugar  in our diet, the appended recipes will be of value, as they deal with  varied forms of nutritious, attractive sugarless desserts. It is only  by the one-ounce savings of each individual member of our great one  hundred million population that the world sugar shortage may be met,  and it is hoped every housekeeper will study her own time-tested  recipes with the view of utilizing as far as possible other forms of  sweetening. In most recipes the liquid should be slightly reduced in  amount and about one-fifth more of the substitute should be used than  the amount of sugar called for.    With a few tests along this line one will be surprised how readily  the substitution may be made. If all sweetening agents become scarce,  desserts can well be abandoned. Served at the end of a full meal,  desserts are excess food except in the diet of children, where they  should form a component part of the meal.
