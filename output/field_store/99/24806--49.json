When we finally came to an  agreement, the Master closed up his ears, walked out, and motioned me to  follow. I did not need to put a hat on, for I had none. Without saying  good-by to my mother, I went after him. And on the following Sunday,  when I was allowed to go back to her little room for the first time, he  gave me half a ham to take with me. God's blessing on the good man's  grave! I still hear his half-angry: \"Tony, under your coat with it, so  my wife won't see it!\"    LEONARD.    You are not crying?    ANTONY (_dries his eyes_).    Yes, I can never think of that without its starting the tears, no matter  how well the source of them may have been stopped up. Oh well, that's  all right! If I should ever get the dropsy, I shall at any rate not have  to draw off these drops too.    [_With a sudden turn._]    What do you think about it?--Supposing on a Sunday afternoon you went  over to smoke a pipe of tobacco with a friend, a friend to whom you owed  everything in the world; and supposing you found him greatly confused  and perturbed, a knife in his hand--the same knife you had used a  thousand times to cut his evening bread--and holding it, covered with  blood, at his neck, and nervously drawing his handkerchief up to his  chin--    LEONARD.    And that is the way old Gebhard went about to the end of his days.    ANTONY.    On account of the scar. And supposing you arrived in time to help save  him, but to do it you had not only to wrench the knife out of his hand  and bandage the wound, but you had also to give over a paltry thousand  thalers that you had saved up; and, furthermore, you had to do it all  absolutely on the sly, so as to induce the sick man to accept it, what  would you do?    LEONARD.    Being a free and single man, without wife and child, I would sacrifice  the money.    ANTONY.    And if you had ten wives, like the Turks, and as many children as were  promised to Father Abraham, and if you took only one second to think  about it, you would be--Well, you are to be my son-in-law! Now you know  where the money is. Today I could tell you, for my old Master is buried;  a month ago I would have kept the secret even on my death-bed. I slipped  the note under the dead man's head before they nailed up the coffin. If  I had known how to write, I would have written underneath: \"Honestly  paid!\" But, ignorant as I am, there was nothing for me to do but tear  the paper in two. Now he will sleep in peace--and I hope that I shall  too, when they stretch me out beside him.        SCENE VI    MOTHER (_enters hurriedly_).    Do you still know me?    ANTONY (_pointing to the wedding dress_).    The frame, yes--that is perfectly preserved; but the picture--not so  well. It seems to be covered with cobwebs. Oh, well! there has been time  enough for it.    MOTHER.    Have I not a frank husband? Still, I do not need to praise him  specially--frankness is a virtue of married men!    ANTONY.    Are you sorry that you were better gilded at twenty than you are at  fifty?    MOTHER.    Certainly not! If I were, I ought to be ashamed both for myself and for  you!    ANTONY.    Give me a kiss then! I am shaved and look better than usual.    MOTHER.    I say yes, merely to test you, to see if you still understand the art.  It is a long time since such a thing has occurred to you!    ANTONY.    Good mother, I will not ask you to close my eyes; that is a hard thing  to do, and I will take it off your hands. I will do that final service  of love for you. But you must grant me time, understand, to harden and  prepare myself for it, so that I won't make a botch of it. It would have  been much too soon!    MOTHER.    Thank God that we are still going to have a little time together!    ANTONY.    I hope so too! You have your old red cheeks again!    MOTHER.    A comical fellow, our new grave-digger! He was digging a grave this  morning when I passed through the church-yard. I asked him whom it was  for. \"For whomsoever God wills,\" he said. \"Perhaps for myself. The same  thing may happen to me that happened to my grandfather; he too had dug  one on chance once, and at night when he came home from the Inn he fell  into it and broke his neck.\"    LEONARD (_who, up to this time, has been reading the weekly paper_).    The fellow doesn't come from here--he can tell all the lies he likes.    MOTHER.    I asked him: \"Why don't you wait until somebody orders a grave dug?\" \"I  was invited to a wedding today,\" he said, \"and I am enough of a prophet  to know that I would still feel the effects of it in my head tomorrow if  I went. Now of course _some_ body has been inconsiderate enough to go and  die, so that in the morning I would have to get up early and would not  be able to sleep it off.\"    ANTONY.    \"You clown!\" I would have said, \"supposing now the grave doesn't fit?\"    MOTHER.    I said that too, but he shook sharp answers out of his sleeve, as the  devil does fleas. \"I took the measurement for Veit, the weaver,\" he  said, \"who, like King Saul, towers a head above everybody else. Now,  come who may, he will not find his house too small; and if it is too  large, that doesn't hurt anybody but me, for, as an honest man, I never  charge for a single foot more than the length of the coffin.\" I threw my  flowers into the grave and said: \"Now it is occupied!\"    ANTONY.    I think the fellow was only joking, and even that is sinful enough. To  dig graves in advance is to set the trap of death too soon; the  scoundrel who does it ought to be driven out of the business.    [_To LEONARD, who is still reading._]    What's the news? Is there any philanthropist looking for a poor widow,  who can use a few hundred thalers, or, _vice versa_, a poor widow  looking for a philanthropist who can supply them?    LEONARD.    The police announce the theft of some jewelry. Strange enough! It seems  that, in spite of the hard times, there are still people among us who  can own jewels!    ANTONY.    The theft of some jewelry? Where?    LEONARD.    Over at Wolfram's.    ANTONY.    At--impossible! Carl polished a desk there a few days ago!    LEONARD.    They were taken from a desk. Right!    MOTHER (_to Master_ ANTONY).    May God forgive you for saying that!    ANTONY.    You are right--it was a vile thought!    MOTHER.    To your son you are only half a father! I must tell you that!    ANTONY.    Wife! We'll not discuss that today!    MOTHER.    He is not like you--but is that any reason why he must be bad?    ANTONY.    Then where is he now? The noon hour struck long ago! I'll wager the  dinner is burning and spoiling, because Clara has secret orders not to  set the table until he is here!    MOTHER.    Where do you think he is? At the worst he is only bowling, and he has to  go the longest way about so that you won't see him. Naturally it takes  him a long time to get back!--I cannot see what you have against the  innocent game.    ANTONY.    Against the game? Nothing whatever! Noble men must have some way to pass  the time. Without the king of hearts, the real kings would often find  life tedious; and if bowling balls had not been invented, who knows  whether princes and barons would not be using our heads for the purpose?  But an ordinary workingman cannot do anything worse than spend his  hard-earned money on games. We must respect that which we have  laboriously earned in the sweat of our brows; we must hold it high and  precious, unless we are to lose our bearings and regard all our works  and doings with contempt. How can I strain all my nerves to earn a  thaler which I intend to throw away?    [_The door-bell is heard outside._]        SCENE VII    _Enter_ ADAM, _a Bailiff; another Bailiff._    ADAM (_to Master_ ANTONY).    Now, you just go ahead and pay your wager! No people in red coats with  blue trimmings [_with emphasis_] shall ever enter your house, eh?--Well,  here are two of us!    [_To the other bailiff._]    Why don't you keep your hat on, as I do? Who is going to observe  formalities among people of his own class?    ANTONY.    Your own class? You blackguard!    ADAM.    You are right--we are not among our own class! Scoundrels and thieves  are not of our class! [_Points to the dresser._] Open that up! And then  three steps away--so that you can't sneak anything out of it!    ANTONY.    What? What?    CLARA (_enters with things to set the table_).    Shall I--[_She stops, speechless._]    ADAM (_exhibits a paper_).    Can you read writing?    ANTONY.    Should I be able to do what even my schoolmaster could not do?    ADAM.    Then listen! Your son has stolen some jewelry! We have the thief  already! Now we are here to search the house!    MOTHER (_falls down and dies_).    Oh, God!    CLARA.    Mother! Mother! How her eyes roll!    LEONARD.    I will fetch a doctor!    ANTONY.    Not necessary! That is the last look! I have seen it a hundred times!  Good night, Theresa! You died when you heard it! Let them write that on  your gravestone!    LEONARD.    But perhaps it is [_starts to go_]--awful! But lucky for me!    [_Exit._]    ANTONY (_pulls a bunch of keys from his pocket and throws them down_).    There! Unlock everything! Drawer after drawer! Bring the ax! The key to  the trunk is lost! Ha! Scoundrels and thieves! [_He turns his pockets  inside out._] I find nothing here!    SECOND BAILIFF.    Master Antony, calm yourself! Everybody knows that you are the most  honest man in town!    ANTONY.    So? So?    [_Laughs._]    Yes,    I have used up all the honesty in the family! There, poor boy! There was  none left for him! She too [_points to the dead body_] was much too  virtuous!--Who knows whether or not the daughter--[_Suddenly to CLARA_]    What do you think, my innocent child?    CLARA.    Father!    SECOND BAILIFF (_to ADAM_).    Have you no pity?    ADAM.    Pity? Am I prying into the old fellow's pockets? Am I forcing him to  take off his stockings and turn his shoes inside out? I meant to start  out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13033"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"length, attracted our attention and I wished to take it alive, but as  Roach, the collector, was at a distance, some time elapsed before  preparations were made for that purpose. The ground was soft and full of  holes, into one of which it would doubtless have disappeared as soon as  it was alarmed. The rest of the party came up yet, unlike snakes in  general, who glide rapidly off, this creature lay apparently regardless  of noise, or even of the approach of the man, who went slowly behind it  and seized its head. At that moment a little bird fluttered from beside a  small tuft within a few feet of the snake and, it seemed, as the men  believed, scarcely able to make its escape.    When we were near the spot on which we intended to encamp a native  pointed out to me a small hill beyond the river where, as he informed me,  Mr. Oxley and his party had encamped before he crossed the Lachlan. It  was called by this native Gobberguyn. We pitched our tents a little  higher than that hill where a favourable bend of the river met my line of  route. The cattle were much fatigued with the day's work although the  distance did not exceed eleven miles. It was in my power however to give  them rest for a day or two as the grass was tolerably good on that part  of the riverbank, and I was within reach of Mount Granard, a height which  I had long been anxious to examine, as well as the country to be seen  from it. Among the usual grasses we found one which I had not previously  seen and which proved to be a new species of Danthonia.*    (*Footnote. Danthonia pectinata, Lindley manuscripts; spica simplici  secunda pleiostachya pectinata foliis multo longiore, palea inferiore  villosissima; laciniis lateralibus membranaceis aristae aequalibus.)    RIDE TO MOUNT GRANARD.    April 7.    I set off early for Mount Granard, followed by six men on horseback and a  native named Barney who was also mounted. We rode at a smart pace on a  bearing of 280 degrees across thirty miles of soft red sand in which the  horses sank up to their fetlocks, and we reached the foot of the hill a  little before sunset.    SCARCITY OF WATER THERE.    Throughout that extent we neither saw a single watercourse nor discovered  the least indication of water having lodged there during any season. At  eleven miles from the camp we crossed a low ridge of granite (named  Tarratta) a hopeful circumstance to us as promising a primitive range of  hills between the Darling and Lachlan, and because in a crevice of this  granite our aboriginal guide found some water. The desert tract we  crossed was in other respects unvaried except that, in one place, we  passed through four miles of a kind of scrub which presented difficulties  of a new character. The whole of it consisted of bushes of a dwarf  species of eucalyptus, doubtless E. dumosa (A. Cunningham) which grew in  a manner that rendered it impossible to proceed, except in a very sinuous  direction, and then with difficulty by pushing our horses between stiffly  grown branches. Where no bushes grew the earth was naked, except where  some tufts of a coarse matted weed resembling Spinifex impeded the  horses, but seemed to be intended by Providence to bind down these desert  sands. We saw blue ranges on our right, and I hoped that before we  ascended Mount Granard we should cross some watercourse coming from them;  but nothing of the kind appeared and, after traversing a dry sandy flat,  we began to ascend. Finding myself separated from the summit, after we  had climbed some way, by a deep rocky ravine, and being in doubt about  obtaining water, I sent the people with the horses to encamp in the  valley to which that ravine opened, with directions to look for water  while daylight lasted.    VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT.    Meanwhile I proceeded to the summit with one of the men and the native. I  arrived there and, just before the sun went down, obtained an  uninterrupted view of the western horizon; but the scene was inconclusive  as to the existence of such a dividing range as I hoped to see. Ridges  and summits appeared abundantly enough, but they were not of a bold or  connected character, and I did not obtain upon the whole a better idea  than I previously had respecting the extension of that singular group of  hills to the westward. I stood upon the best height however for carrying  on my angles in that direction. To the eastward I saw Hurd's Peak and  Bolloon, also Goulburn's and Macquarie's ranges, Mount Torrens, and Mount  Aiton of Oxley. The last hill appeared alone on the horizon, in a  south-south-east direction as shown in his map. But the most commanding  point was Yerrarar, the highest apex of Goulburn range, forming with  Bolloon and this station an almost equilateral triangle of about 30 miles  a side.    The features before us terminated rather abruptly towards the south like  cliffs of tableland, and seemed to mark out the basin of the Lachlan; but  beyond those parts overlooking Mr. Oxley's route I could obtain no view,  although I perceived that I might from Yerrarar.    ENCAMP THERE.    Having completed my work as the sun was setting I hastened to the valley,  and learnt that the party had discovered neither water nor grass. Barney  the native had nevertheless obtained both when with me at the top of the  mountain; and therefore, although it was dark and we were all fatigued,  yet up that rocky mountain we were compelled to go with the horses, and  encamp near the summit beside a little pool of water which had been  well-known to Barney at other times. On this elevated crest the air was  surprisingly mild during the night for, although I slept in my clothes  and on the ground, I enjoyed its freshness as a great relief from the  oppressive heat of the day. Our singular bivouac on the summit, which I  had so long wished to visit, was adorned with a strange-looking tree,  probably Casuarina glauca.    April 8.    Next morning I had an opportunity of surveying the hills around me more  at leisure, and I noted down their various names from the lips of Barney  for that desolate region, where neither a kangaroo nor a bird was to be  seen or heard, was poor Barney's country, that lonely mountain his home!    I learned that the only water in these deserts was to be found in the  crevices of rocks on such hills as this; and I thus understood the cause  of the smoke I observed last year arising from so many summits when I  looked over the same region from a hill on its northern limits. Perhaps  within thirty miles around there was no other water, and the bare top of  a mountain was certainly one of the last situations where I should have  thought of seeking for it.    We descended after I had completed my survey from a hill which perhaps no  white man will again ascend; I may however add, for the information of  those who may be disposed to do so, that the well is on the crest of a  ridge extending north-west from the principal summit, and distant  therefrom about 200 yards. I had brought provisions for another day as I  originally intended to examine the course of the Lachlan above Mount  Torrens; but having seen enough from this hill to satisfy me on that  point we retraced our steps to the camp.    April 9.    This day I halted as well to rest the horses as for the purpose of  observing equal altitudes of the sun and protracting my survey.    ASCEND BOLLOON, A HILL BEYOND THE LACHLAN.    April 10.    Leaving the party encamped I crossed the Lachlan and rode eight miles due  south to Bolloon which proved to be the highest cone of a low ridge  situated within the great bend of this river. I found it a valuable  station for continuing my chain of triangles downwards, as from it Mounts  Cunningham and Allan, Hurd's Peak, Peel's and Goulburn ranges, Mount  Granard, etc. are all visible. We passed some lower hills belonging to  the same chain, and of which the basis seemed to be the prevailing  ferruginous sandstone. In my return to the camp I found the dogs had  killed an emu.    NATIVES REFUSE TO EAT EMU.    It is singular that none of the natives would eat of this bird; and the  reasons they gave were that they were young men, and that none but older  men who had gins were allowed to eat it; adding that it would make young  men all over boils or eruptions. This rule of abstinence was also rigidly  observed by our interpreter Piper.    NATIVE DOG.    Late in the night I was awoke by one of the watch firing a pistol at a  native dog which had got close to the sheepfold. At the same moment a  sheep leaped out and, having been at the first alarm pursued by our dogs,  it was worried in the bed of the river. The native dog having howled as  it escaped was supposed to have been wounded. To prevent such occurrences  in future and as this arose from a neglect of my original plan, the two  fires of the men's tents were ordered to be again placed in such  positions as threw light around the sheepfold, which was of canvas  fastened to portable stakes and pegs. (See plan of camp, Volume 1.)    KALINGALUNGAGUY.    April 11.    We left this camp (named Camarba) and continued our journey around the  great bend of the Lachlan at which point (4 1/2 miles from our camp) the  low ridge of Kalingalungaguy closed on the river. This ridge is a  remarkable feature, extending north and south, and I expected to see some  tributary from the north entering the river here; but we crossed on the  east side of the ridge only a wide, dry and grassy hollow, which was  however evidently the channel of a considerable body of water in times of  flood, as appeared by marks on the trees which grew along the banks. All  were of the dwarf box kind, named goborro by the natives, a sort of  eucalyptus which usually grows by itself on the lower margins of the  Darling and Lachlan, and other parts subject to inundation, and on which  the occasional rise of the waters is marked by the dark colour remaining  on the lower part of the trunk.
