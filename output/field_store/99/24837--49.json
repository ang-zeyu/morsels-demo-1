In the great French gun and armour-plate works at Creuzot (Saone      et Loire) the salaries of expectant mothers among the employees      are raised; arrangements are made for giving them proper advice      and medical attendance; they are not allowed to work after the      middle of pregnancy or to return to work after confinement      without a medical certificate of fitness. The results are said to      be excellent, not only on the health of the mothers, but in the      diminution of premature births, the decrease of infantile deaths,      and the general prevalence of breast-feeding. It would probably      be hopeless to expect many employers in Anglo-Saxon lands to      adopt this policy. They are too \"practical,\" they know how small      is the money-value of human lives. With us it is necessary for      the State to intervene.        There can be no doubt that, on the whole, modern civilized      communities are beginning to realize that under the social and      economic conditions now tending more and more to prevail, they      must in their own interests insure that the mother's best energy      and vitality are devoted to the child, both before and after its      birth. They are also realizing that they cannot carry out their      duty in this respect unless they make adequate provision for the      mothers who are thus compelled to renounce their employment in      order to devote themselves to their children. We here reach a      point at which Individualism is at one with Socialism. The      individualist cannot fail to see that it is at all cost necessary      to remove social conditions which crush out all individuality;      the Socialist cannot fail to see that a society which neglects to      introduce order at this central and vital point, the production      of the individual, must speedily perish.    It is involved in the proper fulfilment of a mother's relationship to her  infant child that, provided she is healthy, she should suckle it. Of  recent years this question has become a matter of serious gravity. In the  middle of the eighteenth century, when the upper-class women of France had  grown disinclined to suckle their own children, Rousseau raised so loud  and eloquent a protest that it became once more the fashion for a woman to  fulfil her natural duties. At the present time, when the same evil is  found once more, and in a far more serious form, for now it is not the  small upper-class but the great lower-class that is concerned, the  eloquence of a Rousseau would be powerless, for it is not fashion so much  as convenience, and especially an intractable economic factor, that is  chiefly concerned. Not the least urgent reason for putting women, and  especially mothers, upon a sounder economic basis, is the necessity of  enabling them to suckle their children.        No woman is sound, healthy, and complete unless she possesses      breasts that are beautiful enough to hold the promise of being      functional when the time for their exercise arrives, and nipples      that can give suck. The gravity of this question to-day is shown      by the frequency with which women are lacking in this essential      element of womanhood, and the young man of to-day, it has been      said, often in taking a wife, \"actually marries but part of a      woman, the other part being exhibited in the chemist's shop      window, in the shape of a glass feeding-bottle.\" Blacker found      among a thousand patients from the maternity department of      University College Hospital that thirty-nine had never suckled at      all, seven hundred and forty-seven had suckled all their      children, and two hundred and fourteen had suckled only some.      The chief reason given for not suckling was absence or      insufficiency of milk; other reasons being inability or      disinclination to suckle, and refusal of the child to take the      breast (Blacker, _Medical Chronicle_, Feb., 1900). These results      among the London poor are certainly very much better than could      be found in many manufacturing towns where women work after      marriage. In the other large countries of Europe equally      unsatisfactory results are found. In Paris Madame Dluska has      shown that of 209 women who came for their confinement to the      Clinique Baudelocque, only 74 suckled their children; of the 135      who did not suckle, 35 were prevented by pathological causes or      absence of milk, 100 by the necessities of their work. Even those      who suckled could seldom continue more than seven months on      account of the physiological strain of work (Dluska,      _Contribution a l'Etude de l'Allaitement Maternel_, These de      Paris, 1894). Many statistics have been gathered in the German      countries. Thus Wiedow (_Centralblatt fuer Gynaekologie_, No. 29,      1895) found that of 525 women at the Freiburg Maternity only half      could suckle thoroughly during the first two weeks; imperfect      nipples were noted in 49 cases, and it was found that the      development of the nipple bore a direct relation to the value of      the breast as a secretory organ. At Munich Escherich and Bueller      found that nearly 60 per cent. of women of the lower class were      unable to suckle their children, and at Stuttgart three-quarters      of the child-bearing women were in this condition.    The reasons why children should be suckled at their mothers' breasts are  larger than some may be inclined to believe. In the first place the  psychological reason is one of no mean importance. The breast with its  exquisitely sensitive nipple, vibrating in harmony with the sexual organs,  furnishes the normal mechanism by which maternal love is developed. No  doubt the woman who never suckles her child may love it, but such love is  liable to remain defective on the fundamental and instinctive side. In  some women, indeed, whom we may hesitate to call abnormal, maternal love  fails to awaken at all until brought into action through this mechanism by  the act of suckling.    A more generally recognized and certainly fundamental reason for suckling  the child is that the milk of the mother, provided she is reasonably  healthy, is the infant's only ideally fit food. There are some people  whose confidence in science leads them to believe that it is possible to  manufacture foods that are as good or better than mother's milk; they  fancy that the milk which is best for the calf is equally best for so  different an animal as the baby. These are delusions. The infant's best  food is that elaborated in his own mother's body. All other foods are more  or less possible substitutes, which require trouble to prepare properly  and are, moreover, exposed to various risks from which the mother's milk  is free.    A further reason, especially among the poor, against the use of any  artificial foods is that it accustoms those around the child to try  experiments with its feeding and to fancy that any kind of food they eat  themselves may be good for the infant. It thus happens that bread and  potatoes, brandy and gin, are thrust into infants' mouths. With the infant  that is given the breast it is easier to make plain that, except by the  doctor's orders, nothing else must be given.    An additional reason why the mother should suckle her child is the close  and frequent association with the child thus involved. Not only is the  child better cared for in all respects, but the mother is not deprived of  the discipline of such care, and is also enabled from the outset to learn  and to understand the child's nature.        The inability to suckle acquires great significance if we realize      that it is associated, probably in a large measure as a direct      cause, with infantile mortality. The mortality of      artificially-fed infants during the first year of life is seldom      less than double that of the breast-fed, sometimes it is as much      as three times that of the breast-fed, or even more; thus at      Derby 51.7 per cent. of hand-fed infants die under the age of      twelve months, but only 8.6 per cent. of breast-fed infants.      Those who survive are by no means free from suffering. At the end      of the first year they are found to weigh about 25 per cent. less      than the breast-fed, and to be much shorter; they are more liable      to tuberculosis and rickets, with all the evil results that flow      from these diseases; and there is some reason to believe that the      development of their teeth is injuriously affected. The      degenerate character of the artificially-fed is well indicated by      the fact that of 40,000 children who were brought for treatment      to the Children's Hospital in Munich, 86 per cent. had been      brought up by hand, and the few who had been suckled had usually      only had the breast for a short time. The evil influence persists      even up to adult life. In some parts of France where the      wet-nurse industry flourishes so greatly that nearly all the      children are brought up by hand, it has been found that the      percentage of rejected conscripts is nearly double that for      France generally. Corresponding results have been found by      Friedjung in a large German athletic association. Among 155      members, 65 per cent. were found on inquiry to have been      breast-fed as infants (for an average of six months); but among      the best athletes the percentage of breast-fed rose to 72 per      cent. (for an average period of nine or ten months), while for      the group of 56 who stood lowest in athletic power the percentage      of breast-fed fell to 57 (for an average of only three months).        The advantages for an infant of being suckled by its mother are      greater than can be accounted for by the mere fact of being      suckled rather than hand-fed. This has been shown by Vitrey (_De      la Mortalite Infantile_, These de Lyon, 1907), who found "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#9)"],[1," the shafts of the middle arch, but not of the others, are  crockets for the whole height, and the innermost cavetto is entirely  filled with dog-tooth ornament. All the shafts have floriated  capitals; and the great arches have similar mouldings. Four sets of  ornaments run round each arch; a continuous chevron, a richly floriated  roll, a roll with bands, and a series of billets. Between the arches  there rises a clustered shaft which reaches to the level of the highest  points of the arches: here these shafts combine with an ornamented  stringcourse which runs in a straight line along the entire front. In  each of the six spandrels are a deeply recessed quatrefoil, two  trefoiled arches (like the upper part of a niche), a pair of  lancet-shaped niches containing figures, and a beautifully designed  hexagonal ornament, with wavy edges, the cusps uniting in a central  boss. The pinnacles on each side of the middle gable are at first  square, then there are two octagonal stages, the uppermost pierced, and  finally a short spire. The lowest stage has a double lancet with  floriated capitals; the second has a lancet, also with floriated  capitals, filling up each face of the octagon; the last stage has  round-headed lancets, without capitals, entirely surrounded by zigzags.    [Illustration: Plan of Central Portion of the West Front.]    The gables are richly ornamented. At the head of each is a massive cross  of very fine workmanship. Along the edges of the gables are two rows of  billets and the wavy ornament. Just below the crosses are three large  statues, in niches of which the gable mouldings form the heads. That in  the centre is S. Peter, with a mitre, the right hand uplifted in  blessing, and two keys in the left hand; the other two are S. John and  S. Andrew. Below plain, straight stringcourses, at the foot of these  statues, are three rose windows of exceptional grace and beauty. The  central one has eight spokes radiating from a flat medallion enriched  with conventional foliage; these support trefoil-headed arches which  have their outer mouldings thickly covered with dog-tooth; the whole is  bounded by two circular bands, the inner one ornamented. The two other  rose windows have six spokes instead of eight, the trefoiled arches have  foliage, and the inner moulding of the bounding circles is continuously  waving. The spokes in all three windows have the dog-tooth on each side.  On each side of the lower part of these windows is a trefoil-headed  niche containing a figure. Below these, and resting upon the long  stringcourse that runs above the great arches, are sets of seven  trefoil-headed niches, with a half-niche at each end. Four of these  niches are pierced for windows, which have trefoils with pointed heads,  though the trefoil heads of the niches themselves are round at the  top. The three intervening niches contain figures. All these nine  figures have a nimbus; and as these, with the three under the crosses,  make up twelve, it is assumed that they represent the Apostles. The six  smaller statues, just above, are said to be kings; the twelve below,  benefactors. There are thus thirty statues in all, and most were no  doubt carved at the time of the erection of the front; but two or three  appear to be of earlier date, and may possibly have formed part of the  embellishments of the Saxon church.    [Illustration: Gates to West Porch.]    =The Towers north and south=, up to the height of the parapets, are of  the same date as the portion already described. They are ornamented with  blank arcading in six stages, of different dimensions and character; all  is in perfect harmony with the rest of the composition. The loftiest of  the stages of this arcading has a sub-division with round arches; and  the stage above the great stringcourse has round-headed trefoils so as  to be in keeping with the row of similar arches in the gables; but with  these two exceptions all the arches on the arcades of the tower are  pointed and without cusps. Of the spires which surmount these towers  that on the south is by far the more elegant. It has pinnacles at the  corners of square section, and then another set of triangular pinnacles,  resting on open arches connecting the corner pinnacles with the spire.  These triangular pinnacles are double the height of those at the  corners. All the pinnacles and canopies over the arches have crockets.  This spire is some few feet loftier than that to the north, though most  measurements of the cathedral have hitherto given them as being of the  same height.    The inner wall of the portico, forming the west wall of the cathedral,  is covered with elaborate arcading, and so also are the ends, north and  south. The designs are nearly a continuation of the arcading on the two  towers. There are five lofty windows, now filled with tracery inserted  in the Perpendicular period, the great west window having been enlarged  at the same time. The two side doorways are exceedingly good, and should  be carefully examined. The central doorway must have been of still  greater beauty; but the whole of the upper part of it is hidden by the  porch and parvise inserted beneath the central arch. This doorway is  divided by a fine pillar rising from a well-carved base, with a very  curious scene depicted on it. \"It represents,\" writes Canon Davys,[22]  \"a Benedictine tortured by demons, and was doubtless intended as a  significant hint to the monks that a sacred calling demands a consistent  life.\" The portico retains its original Early English vaulting.    [Illustration: West Porch and Parvise.]    The =Porch= and =Parvise= beneath the middle arch was inserted, as has  been previously stated, as a support to the two great piers. It is  vaulted in two bays, the first being of the same dimensions as the inner  width of the portico; the western bay (of the same size) thus reaches  beyond the two great piers, and the corner turrets and buttresses in all  project about seven feet. This gives a very substantial support to the  piers. The whole composition is very fine, and quite worthy of the great  portico to which it is an adjunct. It must be left to each spectator to  decide for himself if it improves or diminishes the effect of the  whole. It is of late Decorated date, highly enriched with profuse  carving. The staircase turrets, as well as the great window are  embattled. Possibly there may have been pinnacles now lost. The spaces  north and south, and within the portico, have tracery on the walls  similar to the window. The groining is very fine. One of the central  bosses has a representation of the Trinity. The Father is represented as  the Ancient of Days, with a Dove for the Holy Spirit above the shoulder,  and the figure of the Saviour on the Cross in front. Freemasons are  recommended to look for a special symbol which they alone can understand  and appreciate.    The floor of the portico is paved with gravestones, some apparently in  their original position. This place was at one time appropriated as a  burial place for the Minor Canons.[23] Some of the stones, however, are  of mediaeval date, and it can be seen where the brasses have been  wrenched from them: some of these have been used again for later  inscriptions. One stone bears an incised cross originally filled with  some coloured composition. Some of the marble wall-shafts had fallen,  and their places had been filled by stone substitutes. Others had been  cheaply replaced by wood. The stone shafts still remain, but the wooden  imitations have all been replaced by new marble which was specially  quarried for this reconstruction.    Wood had also been used for the repair of the battlements on the gable  of the porch under the centre arch of the west front. These have, of  course, been reconstructed in stone. All the criticisms that have been  passed by amateur architects upon the front, as a termination to the  building, cannot be discussed here. It is clear, however, that the  existence of the portico does away with any objection that could be made  (as has been done with regard to the west fronts at Lincoln, Wells, and  elsewhere), that the front might be considered to hide rather than to  bring out the construction of the nave and aisles. It is true that the  side gables are not the gables of the aisles, and indeed the roofs that  are built against the gables are built only for them; but they are a  legitimate finish to the great arches, and to the vaulted roof of the  portico. Possibly the inequality of the great arches may be explained  when we reflect that the central gable is the honest termination of the  nave roof; the two central piers were therefore bound to be built so as  to give support to the existing nave roof, and to fit it. The position  of these piers being fixed, the outer ones might be as distant as was  desired, for the front must of course extend to the entire length of the  western transept. It has been commonly supposed that the three great  arches of the Lincoln front suggested the idea to the Peterborough  builders. If so, they improved upon their model. The central arch at  Lincoln even before the round arch was altered, must have been half as  high again as the side arches; and as they all are integral parts of the  wall, and therefore not open, they have somewhat the appearance of  magnified doorways that have been blocked up. At Snettisham, in Norfolk,  is a western doorway protected by a porch with three open arches; and  this has sometimes been mentioned when Peterborough west front is a  subject of discussion; not, of course, as a fitting comparison, but as  an illustration of the architectural method employed. At Snettisham,  however, the porch is a small erection even for the church to which it  gives entrance, and does not nearly extend to the entire width of the  building.
