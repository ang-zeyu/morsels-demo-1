[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#9)"],[1,"in former days was the county town  of Suffolk, Ipswich. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries  ships from most of the countries of Western Europe disembarked their  cargoes on its quays--wines from Spain, timber from Norway, cloth from  Flanders, salt from France, and \"mercerie\" from Italy left its crowded  wharves to be offered for sale in the narrow, busy streets of the  borough. Stores of fish from Iceland, bales of wool, loads of untanned  hides, as well as the varied agricultural produce of the district,  were exposed twice in the week on the market stalls.[6] The learned  editor of the _Memorials of Old Suffolk_, who knows the old town so  well, tells us that the stalls of the numerous markets lay within a  narrow limit of space near the principal churches of the town--St.  Mary-le-Tower, St. Mildred, and St. Lawrence. The Tavern Street of  to-day was the site of the flesh market or cowerye. A narrow street  leading thence to the Tower Church was the Poultry, and Cooks' Row,  Butter Market, Cheese and Fish markets were in the vicinity. The  manufacture of leather was the leading industry of old Ipswich, and  there was a goodly company of skinners, barkers, and tanners employed  in the trade. Tavern Street had, as its name implies, many taverns,  and was called the Vintry, from the large number of opulent vintners  who carried on their trade with London and Bordeaux. Many of these men  were not merely peaceful merchants, but fought with Edward III in his  wars with France and were knighted for their feats of arms. Ipswich  once boasted of a castle which was destroyed in Stephen's reign. In  Saxon times it was fortified by a ditch and a rampart which were  destroyed by the Danes, but the fortifications were renewed in the  time of King John, when a wall was built round the town with four  gates which took their names from the points of the compass. Portions  of these remain to bear witness to the importance of this ancient  town. We give views of an old building near the custom-house in  College Street and Fore Street, examples of the narrow, tortuous  thoroughfares which modern improvements have not swept away.      [6] Cf. _Memorials of Suffolk_, edited by V.B. Redstone.    [Illustration: Tudor House, Ipswich, near the Custom House]    [Illustration: Three-gabled House, Fore Street, Ipswich]    We cannot give accounts of all the old fortified towns in England and  can only make selections. We have alluded to the ancient walls of  York. Few cities can rival it in interest and architectural beauty,  its relics of Roman times, its stately and magnificent cathedral, the  beautiful ruins of St. Mary's Abbey, the numerous churches exhibiting  all the grandeur of the various styles of Gothic architecture, the old  merchants' hall, and the quaint old narrow streets with gabled houses  and widely projecting storeys. And then there is the varied history of  the place dating from far-off Roman times. Not the least interesting  feature of York are its gates and walls. Some parts of the walls are  Roman, that curious thirteen-sided building called the multangular  tower forming part of it, and also the lower part of the wall leading  from this tower to Bootham Bar, the upper part being of later origin.  These walls have witnessed much fighting, and the cannons in the Civil  War during the siege in 1644 battered down some portions of them and  sorely tried their hearts. But they have been kept in good  preservation and repaired at times, and the part on the west of the  Ouse is especially well preserved. You can see some Norman and Early  English work, but the bulk of it belongs to Edwardian times, when York  played a great part in the history of England, and King Edward I made  it his capital during the war with Scotland, and all the great nobles  of England sojourned there. Edward II spent much time there, and the  minster saw the marriage of his son. These walls were often sorely  needed to check the inroads of the Scots. After Bannockburn fifteen  thousand of these northern warriors advanced to the gates of York. The  four gates of the city are very remarkable. Micklegate Bar consists of  a square tower built over a circular arch of Norman date with  embattled turrets at the angles. On it the heads of traitors were  formerly exposed. It bears on its front the arms of France as well as  those of England.    [Illustration: \"Melia's Passage,\" York]    Bootham Bar is the main entrance from the north, and has a Norman arch  with later additions and turrets with narrow slits for the discharge  of arrows. It saw the burning of the suburb of Bootham in 1265 and  much bloodshed, when a mighty quarrel raged between the citizens and  the monks of the Abbey of St. Mary owing to the abuse of the privilege  of sanctuary possessed by the monastery. Monk Bar has nothing to do  with monks. Its former name was Goodramgate, and after the Restoration  it was changed to Monk Bar in honour of General Monk. The present  structure was probably built in the fourteenth century. Walmgate Bar,  a strong, formidable structure, was built in the reign of Edward I,  and as we have said, it is the only gate that retains its curious  barbican, originally built in the time of Edward III and rebuilt in  1648. The inner front of the gate has been altered from its original  form in order to secure more accommodation within. The remains of the  Clifford's Tower, which played an important part in the siege, tell of  the destruction caused by the blowing up of the magazine in 1683, an  event which had more the appearance of design than accident. York  abounds with quaint houses and narrow streets. We give an illustration  of the curious Melia's Passage; the origin of the name I am at a loss  to conjecture.    Chester is, we believe, the only city in England which has retained  the entire circuit of its walls complete. According to old unreliable  legends, Marius, or Marcius, King of the British, grandson of  Cymbeline, who began his reign A.D. 73, first surrounded Chester with  a wall, a mysterious person who must be classed with Leon Gawr, or  Vawr, a mighty strong giant who founded Chester, digging caverns in  the rocks for habitations, and with the story of King Leir, who first  made human habitations in the future city. Possibly there was here a  British camp. It was certainly a Roman city, and has preserved the  form and plan which the Romans were accustomed to affect; its four  principal streets diverging at right angles from a common centre, and  extending north, east, south, and west, and terminating in a gate, the  other streets forming insulae as at Silchester. There is every reason  to believe that the Romans surrounded the city with a wall. Its  strength was often tried. Hither the Saxons came under Ethelfrith and  pillaged the city, but left it to the Britons, who were not again  dislodged until Egbert came in 828 and recovered it. The Danish  pirates came here and were besieged by Alfred, who slew all within its  walls. These walls were standing but ruinous when the noble daughter  of Alfred, Ethelfleda, restored them in 907. A volume would be needed  to give a full account of Chester's varied history, and our main  concern is with the treasures that remain. The circumference of the  walls is nearly two miles, and there are four principal gates besides  posterns--the North, East, Bridge-gate, and Water-gate. The North Gate  was in the charge of the citizens; the others were held by persons who  had that office by serjeanty under the Earls of Chester, and were  entitled to certain tolls, which, with the custody of the gates, were  frequently purchased by the Corporation. The custody of the  Bridge-gate belonged to the Raby family in the reign of Edward III. It  had two round towers, on the westernmost of which was an octagonal  water-tower. These were all taken down in 1710-81 and the gate  rebuilt. The East Gate was given by Edward I to Henry Bradford, who  was bound to find a crannoc and a bushel for measuring the salt that  might be brought in. Needless to say, the old gate has vanished. It  was of Roman architecture, and consisted of two arches formed by large  stones. Between the tops of the arches, which were cased with Norman  masonry, was the whole-length figure of a Roman soldier. This gate was  a _porta principalis_, the termination of the great Watling Street  that led from Dover through London to Chester. It was destroyed in  1768, and the present gate erected by Earl Grosvenor. The custody of  the Water-gate belonged to the Earls of Derby. It also was destroyed,  and the present arch erected in 1788. A new North Gate was built in  1809 by Robert, Earl Grosvenor. The principal postern-gates were Cale  Yard Gate, made by the abbot and convent in the reign of Edward I as a  passage to their kitchen garden; New-gate, formerly Woolfield or  Wolf-gate, repaired in 1608, also called Pepper-gate;[7] and  Ship-gate, or Hole-in-the-wall, which alone retains its Roman arch,  and leads to a ferry across the Dee.      [7] The Chester folk have a proverb, \"When the daughter is stolen,    shut Pepper-gate\"--referring to the well-known story of a daughter    of a Mayor of Chester having made her escape with her lover    through this gate, which he ordered to be closed, but too late to    prevent the fugitives.    The walls are strengthened by round towers so placed as not to be  beyond bowshot of each other, in order that their arrows might reach  the enemy who should attempt to scale the walls in the intervals. At  the north-east corner is Newton's Tower, better known as the Phoenix  from a sculptured figure, the ensign of one of the city guilds,  appearing over its door. From this tower Charles I saw the battle of  Rowton Heath and the defeat of his troops during the famous siege of  Chester. This was one of the most prolonged and deadly in the whole  history of the Civil War.

He is inclined toward a friendship with somebody else whose  nature is compatible with his own. From this companionship a group of  wayward children may be formed. They incite one another; they conspire  together; they attract the attention of others; the group may become a  gang. From the pairs, the group, or the gang, mischief or immorality  soon begins, while all around there are many clubs and societies  suitable and available for them.    Furthermore, single-sex clubs will not provide the answer for those who  desire the companionship of the other sex. In our society, boys and  girls must meet socially. It is part of the growing-up process and, if  supervised carefully and unobtrusively[4], the mixing of boys and girls  can be very advantageous.    From the evidence given by witnesses, the following four points emerge:      (_a_) The school today provides so many interests and activities    that the time of the pupil is fully occupied. Since it is    essential to retain the family group as much as possible, in    general, children should not be encouraged to go out excessively    on week nights. The competition of organizations for good school    children as leaders can become unsettling to the young.      (_b_) Adolescents who have left school provide a field in which    club organizations are able to provide interests and activities    for those who have left the directed conditions of school life and    are entering on the freedom of adulthood. Many of these activities    will be for both sexes and their success depends upon trained    leadership.      (_c_) There is much advantage in having the clubs and    organizations within a community locally co-ordinated. Over    lapping can be avoided, facilities are more easily provided, and    the opportunity is given to youth to share in the interests and    efforts of the adult community.      (_d_) The Committee warmly commends the work of all those    societies and clubs which have been active in promoting the    well-being of young people. Chief among the difficulties faced by    these character-building organizations which have made    representations to the Committee is the lack of trained    leadership. Their appeal is for more leaders and for some means by    which these leaders may be trained.      But however desirable and commendable all these services to youth    are, and even allowing for the fact that without them some    children might slip into bad ways, their further development will    not provide the cure. Indeed, much of the immorality which has    occurred has been among children who have had the fullest    opportunity for healthy sport and recreation.      =(3) Liquor and Gambling=    It was strongly urged by religious and benevolent organizations, and  also by many private people, that juvenile delinquency could be  attributed in part to the effects of drinking and betting.    The Committee realizes that drinking and gambling to excess may well be  symptomatic[5] of the type of home where there is child neglect. There  is no need to stress the obvious. But the matter does not rest there.  Much danger is inherent in the view that no social occasion is complete  without liquor. It has come to the notice of the Committee that many  parents are conniving at the practice of having liquor at adolescent  parties. Such parents are being unfair to young people, and the  Committee considers that if right-thinking parents took a firm stand in  this matter a sound lead would be given to the community as a whole.          _X. The Home Environment_      =(1) Feelings of Insecurity: The Unloved Child=    A harmonious emotional development during childhood is one of the most  important factors influencing human behaviour. Any child who feels  unloved, unwanted, or jealous of the care and attention given to other  members of the household suffers from a feeling of insecurity. This  feeling of insecurity renders the child more susceptible to influences  leading to delinquency.    The mother's attitude to the child is of prime importance. There is a  psychological link between mother and child from the very moment of  birth--a link that can be substantially strengthened by breast feeding  as far as it is practicable. The attitude of the mother to the child,  even before birth, may well have a marked effect upon the child's sense  of security. If pregnancy was not welcomed by the mother, her child may  come into the world under a distinct handicap, that of being an unwanted  child. Subsequent adjustment may not be as satisfactory as she imagines  it to be.    There is often, however, a vast difference between the parents' love of  a child and the child's subsequent idea of being loved. The love that  every child needs is affection combined with wisdom--a wisdom that will  show itself in a watchful concern for the child's well-being throughout  childhood to late adolescence. It can be summed up as the kind of love  found in a warm family life where all the members--father, mother, and  children--are in a proper relationship the one to the other. This  relationship is mere difficult to obtain where the child was unwanted or  where one parent becomes unwilling to share with the child the love  which he or she formerly alone received from the other parent.    A child living in an abnormal family environment, whether that  abnormality arises from the birth of the child or the maladjusted  personality of a parent, is the type of child which may later seek  compensation in irregular sexual behaviour. But the child who, during  its early years, lives in an environment where it feels secure, loved,  and accepted is not likely to become a deviant.    Evidence has been presented to the Committee of many cases of  delinquency which may fairly be traced to one of the following causes:      _(a) Emotional Disturbances_ that have arisen out of a divorce,    separation, or remarriage. An emotional upset may arise from a    home that is broken by a divorce or separation or, equally    important, from a home in which tension follows discord between    the parents.      _(b) Poor Discipline_ arising out of a parental notion that love    for the child can be shown by gifts in money or kind, or by    allowing the child to do what it wants to do. Many of the parents    of delinquent children are in that category of people who have    been far too indulgent with their children and have been unable to    say 'No'. It is a big mistake to suppose that the respect and love    of a child will be lost by firm, kindly guidance. The Committee    has evidence that a large group of delinquents detained in an    institution attributed their situation to the failure of their    parents to be firm with them in early life.      _(c) Lack of Training for Parenthood:_ It was somewhat alarming to    find that many parents have found the responsibilities of home    life too much for them. They had entered into matrimony without    having had their attention drawn to the ways in which a home can,    and should, be managed.      The duties which one spouse legally owes to the other are fairly    well known. Thanks particularly to the efforts of the Plunket    Society, great help is available in the rearing and management of    babies. But there is a big gap in the knowledge of the art of    home-making possessed by many parents. Much of that gap has been    filled in by the school, the church, and various youth    organizations, but the more these outside agencies do the less    inclined are some parents to shoulder their own personal    responsibilities. The home should be the place in which all these    activities are co-ordinated: they should supplement home training    and not subtract from it.      _(d) Lack of Responsibility:_ There was no need for anybody to    stress this factor before the Committee--it stood out as a matter    of grave concern. Many of the parents of children affected by    recent happenings throughout the Dominion showed a deplorable lack    of concern for their responsibilities not only to their own    children, but to the associates of their children. It is one thing    to trust a youth; it is quite another thing for parents to go away    for a day of golf or to spend their week-ends away from home    leaving the boy to his own devices. It is one thing for Mrs A to    give her daughter permission to stay the week-end with Mrs B's    daughter, and for Mrs B, to give permission for her daughter to    stay the same week-end with Mrs A's daughter. It is quite another    thing when neither Mrs A nor Mrs B shows that interest in their    daughter which would prevent their being shocked on finding from    the police weeks later that the week-end was spent with other    adolescents in the house of Mr and Mrs X, while those parents in    turn had trusted their son. A simple inquiry by the parents of A,    B, or X during or after the week-end could not be resented, and,    indeed, children would respect their parents more if such an    inquiry were made.      Of lesser import, but still indicative of a lack of awareness of    responsibility, is the attitude of parents who give money to their    children to go to the pictures in order to get them out of the way    without even bothering to look at the programme to see if it is a    suitable one for children.      Admittedly, parenthood, if it is not to end in disaster or the    fear of disaster, is a great responsibility. It involves a    continual struggle against harmful influences from outside. It    demands also parental interest in the activities of the children    and sometimes a measure of self-denial for the children's sake.    Wisdom and experience combine in suggesting to all parents that    they should guide their children, and not be governed by them.      Those who read this report might usefully ponder the question    whether the ever-increasing way in which responsibilities in    character building are "]]]
