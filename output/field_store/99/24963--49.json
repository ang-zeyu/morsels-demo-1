Rut-tetet then asked why they had not been brought,  and the handmaiden replied in words that seem to mean that there was no  barley in the house except that which belonged to the dancing goddesses,  and that that was in a chamber which had been sealed with their seal.  Rut-tetet then told her to go and fetch some of the barley, for she was  quite certain that when her husband Rauser returned he would make good  what she took. Thereupon the handmaiden went to the chamber, and broke  it open, and she heard in it loud cries and shouts, and the sounds of  music and singing and dancing, and all the noises which men make in  honour of the birth of a king, and she went back and told Rut-tetet what  she had heard. Then Rut-tetet herself went through the room, and could  not find the place where the noises came from, but when she laid her  temple against a box, she perceived that the noises were inside it. She  then took this box, which cannot have been of any great size, and put it  in another box, which in turn she put in another box, which she sealed,  and then wrapping this in a leather covering, she laid it in a chamber  containing her jar of barley beer or barley wine, and sealed the door.  When Rauser returned from the fields, Rut-tetet related to him  everything that had happened, and his heart was exceedingly glad, and he  and his wife sat down and enjoyed themselves.    A few days after these events Rut-tetet had a quarrel with her  handmaiden, and she slapped her well. The handmaiden was very angry, and  in the presence of the household she said words to this effect: Dost  thou dare to treat me in this way? I who can destroy thee? She has given  birth to three kings, and I will go and tell the Majesty of King Khufu  of this fact. The handmaiden thought that, if Khufu knew of the views of  Rauser and Rut-tetet about the future of their three sons, and the  prophecies of the goddesses, he would kill the children and perhaps  their parents also. With the object in her mind of telling the king the  handmaiden went to her maternal uncle, whom she found weaving flax on  the walk, and told him what had happened, and said she was going to tell  the king about the three children. From her uncle she obtained neither  support nor sympathy; on the contrary, gathering together several  strands of flax into a thick rope he gave her a good beating with the  same. A little later the handmaiden went to the river or canal to fetch  some water, and whilst she was filling her pot a crocodile seized her  and carried her away and, presumably, ate her. Then the uncle went to  the house of Rut-tetet to tell her what had happened, and he found her  sitting down, with her head bowed over her breast, and exceedingly sad  and miserable. He asked her, saying, \"O Lady, wherefore art thou so  sad?\" And she told him that the cause of her sorrow was the handmaiden,  who had been born in the house and had grown up in it, and who had just  left it, threatening that she would go and tell the king about the birth  of the three kings. The uncle of the handmaiden nodded his head in a  consoling manner, and told Rut-tetet how she had come to him and  informed him what she was going to do, and how he had given her a good  beating with a rope of flax, and how she had gone to the river to fetch  some water, and how a crocodile had carried her off.    There is reason to think that the three sons of Rut-tetet became the  three kings of the fifth dynasty who were known by the names of Khafra,  Menkaura, and Userkaf. The stories given above are valuable because they  contain elements of history, for it is now well known that the immediate  successors of the fourth dynasty, of which Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura,  the builders of the three great pyramids at Gizah, were the most  important kings, were kings who delighted to call themselves sons of Ra,  and who spared no effort to make the form of worship of the Sun-god that  was practised at Anu, or Heliopolis, universal in Egypt. It is probable  that the three magicians, Ubaaner, Tchatchamankh, and Teta were  historical personages, whose abilities and skill in working magic  appealed to the imagination of the Egyptians under all dynasties, and  caused their names to be venerated to a remote posterity.                                         CHAPTER IV                              THE BOOK OF THE DEAD      \"Book of the Dead\" is the name that is now generally given to the large  collection of \"Chapters,\" or compositions, both short and long, which  the ancient Egyptians cut upon the walls of the corridors and chambers  in pyramids and rock-hewn tombs, and cut or painted upon the insides and  outsides of coffins and sarcophagi, and wrote upon papyri, etc., which  were buried with the dead in their tombs. The first modern scholar to  study these Chapters was the eminent Frenchman, J. Francois Champollion;  he rightly concluded that all of them were of a religious character, but  he was wrong in calling the collection as a whole \"Funerary Ritual.\" The  name \"Book of the Dead\" is a translation of the title \"Todtenbuch,\"  given by Dr. R. Lepsius to his edition of a papyrus at Turin, containing  a very long selection of the Chapters,[1] which he published in 1842.  \"Book of the Dead\" is on the whole a very satisfactory general  description of these Chapters, for they deal almost entirely with the  dead, and they were written entirely for the dead. They have nothing to  do with the worship of the gods by those who live on the earth, and such  prayers and hymns as are incorporated with them were supposed to be said  and sung by the dead for their own benefit. The author of the Chapters  of the Book of the Dead was the god Thoth, whose greatness has already  been described in Chapter I of this book. Thus they were considered to  be of divine origin, and were held in the greatest reverence by the  Egyptians at all periods of their long history. They do not all belong  to the same period, for many of them allude to the dismemberment and  burning of the dead, customs that, though common enough in very  primitive times, were abandoned soon after royal dynasties became  established in Egypt.    [Footnote 1: The actual number of Chapters in this papyrus is 165.]    It is probable that in one form or another many of the Chapters were in  existence in the predynastic period,[1] but no copies of such primitive  versions, if they ever existed, have come down to us. One Egyptian  tradition, which is at least as old as the early part of the eighteenth  dynasty (1600 B.C.), states that Chapters XXXB and LXIV were  \"discovered\" during the reign of Semti, a king of the first dynasty, and  another tradition assigns their discovery to the reign of Menkaura (the  Mycerinus of classical writers), a king of the fourth dynasty. It is  certain, however, that the Egyptians possessed a Book of the Dead which  was used for kings and royal personages, at least, early under the first  dynasty, and that, in a form more or less complete, it was in use down  to the time of the coming of Christianity into Egypt. The tombs of the  officials of the third and fourth dynasties prove that the Book of  Opening the Mouth and the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings (see pp. 13-18)  were in use when they were made, and this being so it follows as a  matter of course that at this period the Egyptians believed in the  resurrection of the dead and in their immortality, that the religion of  Osiris was generally accepted, that the efficacy of funerary offerings  was unquestioned by the religious, and that men died believing that  those who were righteous on earth would be rewarded in heaven, and that  the evil-doer would be punished. The Pyramid Texts also prove that a  Book of the Dead divided into chapters was in existence when they were  written, for they mention the \"Chapter of those who come forth (_i.e._  appear in heaven),\" and the \"Chapter of those who rise up\" (Pepi I, l.  463), and the \"Chapter of the _betu_ incense,\" and the \"Chapter of the  natron incense\" (Pepi I, 469). Whether these Chapters formed parts of  the Pyramid Texts, or whether both they and the Pyramid Texts belonged  to the Book of the Dead cannot be said, but it seems clear that the four  Chapters mentioned above formed part of a work belonging to a Book of  the Dead that was older than the Pyramid Texts. This Book of the Dead  was no doubt based upon the beliefs of the followers of the religion of  Osiris, which began in the Delta and spread southwards into Upper Egypt.  Its doctrines must have differed in many important particulars from  those of the worshippers of the Sun-god of Heliopolis, whose priests  preached the existence of a heaven of a solar character, and taught  their followers to believe in the Sun-god Ra, and not in Temu, the  ancient native god of Heliopolis, and not in the divine man Osiris. The  exposition of the Heliopolitan creed is found in the Pyramid Texts,  which also contain the proofs that before the close of the sixth dynasty  the cult of Osiris had vanquished the cult of Ra, and that the religion  of Osiris had triumphed.    [Footnote 1: _i.e._ before Menes became king of both Upper and Lower  Egypt.]    Certain of the Chapters of the Book of the Dead (_e.g._ XXXB and LXIV)  were written in the city of Thoth, or Khemenu, others were written in  Anu, or Heliopolis, and others in Busiris and other towns of the Delta.  Of the Book of the Dead that was in use under the fifth and sixth  dynasties we have no copies, but many Chapters of the Recension in use  under the eleventh and twelfth dynasties are found written in cursive  hieroglyphs upon wooden sarcophagi, many of which may be seen in the  British Museum. With the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty the Book of  the Dead enters a new phase of its existence, and it became the custom  to write it on rolls of papyrus, which were laid with the dead in their  coffins, instead of on the coffins"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#9)"],[1," own fur cap, or even your head; and  then you feel the weight and the edge of Kookooskoos' claws. But he  never learns wisdom by mistakes; for, spite of his grave appearance,  he is excitable as a Frenchman; and so, whenever anything stirs in the  bushes and a bit of fur appears, he cries out to himself, _A rat,  Kookoo! a rabbit!_ and swoops on the instant.    Rats and rabbits are his favorite food, by the way, and he never lets  a chance go by of taking them into camp. I think I never climbed to  his nest without finding plenty of the fur of both animals to tell of  his skill in hunting.    One evening in the twilight, as I came home from hunting in the big  woods, I heard the sound of deer feeding just ahead. I stole forward  to the edge of a thicket and stood there motionless, looking and  listening intently. My cap was in my pocket, and only my head appeared  above the low firs that sheltered me. Suddenly, without noise or  warning of any kind, I received a sharp blow on the head from behind,  as if some one had struck me with a thorny stick. I turned quickly,  surprised and a good bit startled; for I thought myself utterly alone  in the woods--and I was. There was nobody there. Not a sound, not a  motion broke the twilight stillness. Something trickled on my neck; I  put up my hand, to find my hair already wet with blood. More startled  than ever, I sprang through the thicket, looking, listening everywhere  for sight or sound of my enemy. Still no creature bigger than a wood  mouse; no movement save that of nodding fir tips; no sound but the  thumping of my own heart, and, far behind me, a sudden rush and a bump  or two as the frightened deer broke away; then perfect stillness  again, as if nothing had ever lived in the thickets.    I was little more than a boy; and I went home that night more puzzled  and more frightened than I have ever been, before or since, in the  woods. I ran into the doctor's office on my way. He found three cuts  in my scalp, and below them two shorter ones, where pointed things  seemed to have been driven through to the bone. He looked at me  queerly when I told my story. Of course he did not believe me, and I  made no effort to persuade him. Indeed, I scarcely believed myself.  But for the blood which stained my handkerchief, and the throbbing  pain in my head, I should have doubted the reality of the whole  experience.    That night I started up out of sleep, some time towards morning, and  said before I was half awake: \"It was an _owl_ that hit you on the  head--of course it was an owl!\" Then I remembered that, years before,  an older boy had a horned owl, which he had taken from a nest, and  which he kept loose in a dark garret over the shed. None of us younger  boys dared go up to the garret, for the owl was always hungry, and the  moment a boy's head appeared through the scuttle the owl said _Hoooo!_  and swooped for it. So we used to get acquainted with the big pet by  pushing in a dead rat, or a squirrel, or a chicken, on the end of a  stick, and climbing in ourselves afterwards.    As I write, the whole picture comes back to me again vividly; the  dark, cobwebby old garret, pierced here and there by a pencil of  light, in which the motes were dancing; the fierce bird down on the  floor in the darkest corner, horns up, eyes gleaming, feathers all  a-bristle till he looked big as a bushel basket in the dim light,  standing on his game with one foot and tearing it savagely to pieces  with the other, snapping his beak and gobbling up feathers, bones and  all, in great hungry mouthfuls; and, over the scuttle, two or three  small boys staring in eager curiosity, but clinging to each other's  coats fearfully, ready to tumble down the ladder with a yell at the  first hostile demonstration.    The next afternoon I was back in the big woods to investigate. Fifty  feet behind the thicket where I had been struck was a tall dead stub  overlooking a little clearing. \"That's his watch tower,\" I thought.  \"While I was watching the deer, he was up there watching my head, and  when it moved he swooped.\"    I had no intention of giving him another flight at the same game, but  hid my fur cap some distance out in the clearing, tied a long string  to it, went back into the thicket with the other end of the string,  and sat down to wait. A low _Whooo-hoo-hoo!_ came from across the  valley to tell me I was not the only watcher in the woods.    Towards dusk I noticed suddenly that the top of the old stub looked a  bit peculiar, but it was some time before I made out a big owl sitting  up there. I had no idea how long he had been there, nor whence he  came. His back was towards me; he sat up very straight and still, so  as to make himself just a piece, the tip end, of the stub. As I  watched, he hooted once and bent forward to listen. Then I pulled on  my string.    With the first rustle of a leaf he whirled and poised forward, in the  intense attitude an eagle takes when he sights the prey. On the  instant he had sighted the cap, wriggling in and out among the low  bushes, and swooped for it like an arrow. Just as he dropped his legs  to strike, I gave a sharp pull, and the cap jumped from under him. He  missed his strike, but wheeled like a fury and struck again. Another  jerk, and again he missed. Then he was at the thicket where I stood;  his fierce yellow eyes glared straight into mine for a startled  instant, and he brushed me with his wings as he sailed away into the  shadow of the spruces.    Small doubt now that I had seen my assailant of the night before; for  an owl has regular hunting grounds, and uses the same watch towers  night after night. He had seen my head in the thicket, and struck at  the first movement. Perceiving his mistake, he kept straight on over  my head; so of course there was nothing in sight when I turned. As an  owl's flight is perfectly noiseless (the wing feathers are wonderfully  soft, and all the laminae are drawn out into hair points, so that the  wings never whirr nor rustle like other birds') I had heard nothing,  though he passed close enough to strike, and I was listening intently.  And so another mystery of the woods was made plain by a little  watching.    Years afterwards, the knowledge gained stood me in good stead in  clearing up another mystery. It was in a lumber camp--always a  superstitious place--in the heart of a Canada forest. I had followed a  wandering herd of caribou too far one day, and late in the afternoon  found myself alone at a river, some twenty miles from my camp, on the  edge of the barren grounds. Somewhere above me I knew that a crew of  lumbermen were at work; so I headed up river to find their camp, if  possible, and avoid sleeping out in the snow and bitter cold. It was  long after dark, and the moon was flooding forest and river with a  wonderful light, when I at last caught sight of the camp. The click of  my snowshoes brought a dozen big men to the door. At that moment I  felt rather than saw that they seemed troubled and alarmed at seeing  me alone; but I was too tired to notice, and no words save those of  welcome were spoken until I had eaten heartily. Then, as I started out  for another look at the wild beauty of the place under the moonlight,  a lumberman followed and touched me on the shoulder.    \"Best not go far from camp alone, sir. 'T isn't above safe  hereabouts,\" he said in a low voice. I noticed that he glanced back  over his shoulder as he spoke.    \"But why?\" I objected. \"There's nothing in these woods to be afraid  of.\"    \"Come back to camp and I'll tell you. It's warmer there,\" he said. And  I followed to hear a strange story,--how \"Andy there\" was sitting on a  stump, smoking his pipe in the twilight, when he was struck and cut on  the head from behind; and when he sprang up to look, there was nothing  there, nor any track save his own in the snow. The next night  Gillie's fur cap had been snatched from his head, and when _he_ turned  there was nobody in sight; and when he burst into camp, with all his  wits frightened out of him, he could scarcely speak, and his face was  deathly white. Other uncanny things had happened since, in the same  way, and coupled with a bad accident on the river, which the men  thought was an omen, they had put the camp into such a state of  superstitious fear that no one ventured alone out of doors after  nightfall.    I thought of Kookooskoos and my own head, but said nothing. They would  only have resented the suggestion.    Next day I found my caribou, and returned to the lumber camp before  sunset. At twilight there was Kookooskoos, an enormous fellow, looking  like the end of a big spruce stub, keeping sharp watch over the  clearing, and fortunately behind the camp where he could not see the  door. I called the men and set them crouching in the snow under the  low eaves.--\"Stay there a minute and I'll show you the ghost.\" That  was all I told them.    Taking the skin of a hare which I had shot that day, I hoisted it  cautiously on a stick, the lumbermen watching curiously. A slight  scratch of the stick, a movement of the fur along the splits, then a  great dark shadow shot over our heads. It struck the stick sharply  and swept on and up into the spruces across the clearing, taking  Bunny's skin with it.    Then one big lumberman, who saw the point, jumped up with a yell and  danced a jig in the snow, like a schoolboy. There was no need of  further demonstration with a cap; and nobody volunteered his head for  a final experiment; but all remembered seeing the owl on his nightly  watch, and knew something of his swooping habits. Of course some were  incredulous at first, and had a dozen questions and objections when we  were in camp. No one likes to have a good ghost story spoiled; and,  besides, where superstition is, there the marvelous is most easily  believed. It is only the simple truth that is doubted. So I spent half  the night in convincing them that they _had_ "]]]
