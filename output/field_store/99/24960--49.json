With the  carelessness of soldiers, they were chatting away the time till sleep  might come, and help them to to-morrow with its chances; perhaps of  fight, perhaps of another day of this camp indolence. Below the garden  slope where they were lounging, the rapid torrent of Kishon ran brawling  along. A full moon was rising above the rough edge of the Eastern hills,  and the whole scene was alive with the loveliness of an Eastern  landscape.    As they talked together, the strains of a harp came borne down the  stream by the wind, mingling with the rippling of the brook.    \"The boys were right,\" said the captain of the little company. \"They  asked leave to go up the stream to spend their evening with the  Carmel-men; and said that they had there a harper, who would sing and  play for them.\"    \"Singing at night, and fighting in the morning! It is the true soldier's  life,\" said another.    \"Who have they there?\" asked a third.    \"One of those Ziklag-men,\" replied the chief. \"He came into camp a few  days ago, seems to be an old favorite of the king's, and is posted with  his men, by the old tomb on the edge of the hill. If you cross the  brook, he is not far from the Carmel post; and some of his young men  have made acquaintance there.\"    \"One is not a soldier for nothing. If we make enemies at sight, we make  friends at sight too.\"    \"Echish here says that the harper is a Jew.\"    \"What!--a deserter?\"    \"I do not know that; that is the king's lookout. Their company came up a  week ago, were reviewed the day I was on guard at the outposts, and they  had this post I tell you of assigned to them. So the king is satisfied;  and, if he is, I am.\"    \"Jew or Gentile, Jehovah's man or Dagon's man,\" said one of the younger  soldiers, with a half-irreverent tone, \"I wish we had him here to sing  to us.\"    \"And to keep us awake,\" yawned another.    \"Or to keep us from thinking of to-morrow,\" said a third.    \"Can nobody sing here, or play, or tell an old-time story?\"    There was nobody. The only two soldiers of the post, who affected  musical skill, were the two who had gone up to the Carmelites' bivouac;  and the little company of Joppa--catching louder notes and louder, as  the bard's inspiration carried him farther and farther away--crept as  far up the stream as the limits of their station would permit; and lay,  without noise, to catch, as they best could, the rich tones of the music  as it swept down the valley.    Soothed by the sound, and by the moonlight, and by the summer breeze,  they were just in mood to welcome the first interruption which broke the  quiet of the night. It was the approach of one of their company, who had  been detached to Accho a day or two before; and who came hurrying in to  announce the speedy arrival of companions, for whom he bespoke a  welcome. Just as they were to leave Accho, he said, that day, on their  return to camp, an Ionian trading-vessel had entered port. He and his  fellow-soldiers had waited to help her moor, and had been chatting with  her seamen. They had told them of the chance of battle to which they  were returning; and two or three of the younger Ionians, enchanted at  the relief from the sea's imprisonment, had begged them to let them  volunteer in company with them. These men had come up into the country  with the soldiers, therefore; and he who had broken the silence of the  listeners to the distant serenade had hurried on to tell his comrades  that such visitors were on their way.    They soon appeared on foot, but hardly burdened by the light packs they  bore.    A soldier's welcome soon made the Ionian sailors as much at home with  the men of the bivouac, as they had been through the day with the  detachment from the sea-board. A few minutes were enough to draw out  sheep-skins for them to lie upon, a skin of wine for their thirst, a  bunch of raisins and some oat-cakes for their hunger; a few minutes more  had told the news which each party asked from the other; and then these  sons of the sea and these war-bronzed Philistines were as much at ease  with each other as if they had served under the same sky for years.    \"We were listening to music,\" said the old chief, \"when you came up.  Some of our young men have gone up, indeed, to the picket yonder, to  hear the harper sing, whose voice you catch sometimes, when we are not  speaking.\"    \"You find the Muses in the midst of arms, then,\" said one of the young  Ionians.    \"Muses?\" said the old Philistine, laughing. \"That sounds like you  Greeks. Ah! sir, in our rocks here we have few enough Muses, but those  who carry these lances, or teach us how to trade with the islands for  tin.\"    \"That's not quite fair,\" cried another. \"The youngsters who are gone  sing well; and one of them has a harp I should be glad you should see.  He made it himself from a gnarled olive-root.\" And he turned to look for  it.    \"You'll not find it in the tent: the boy took it with him. They hoped  the Ziklag minstrel might ask them to sing, I suppose.\"    \"A harp of olive-wood,\" said the Ionian, \"seems Muse-born and  Pallas-blessed.\"    And, as he spoke, one of the new-comers of the Philistines leaned over,  and whispered to the chief: \"He is a bard himself, and we made him  promise to sing to us. I brought his harp with me that he might cheer up  our bivouac. Pray, do you ask him.\"    The old chief needed no persuasion; and the eyes of the whole force  brightened as they found they had a minstrel \"of their own\" now, when  the old man pressed the young Ionian courteously to let them hear him:  \"I told you, sir, that we had no Muses of our own; but we welcome all  the more those who come to us from over seas.\"    Homer smiled; for it was Homer whom he spoke to,--Homer still in the  freshness of his unblinded youth. He took the harp which the young  Philistine handed to him, thrummed upon its chords, and as he tuned them  said: \"I have no harp of olive-wood; we cut this out, it was years ago,  from an old oleander in the marshes behind Colophon. What will you hear,  gentlemen?\"    \"The poet chooses for himself,\" said the courtly old captain.    \"Let me sing you, then, of _the Olive Harp_\"; and he struck the chords  in a gentle, quieting harmony, which attuned itself to his own spirit,  pleased as he was to find music and harmony and the olive of peace in  the midst of the rough bivouac, where he had come up to look for war.  But he was destined to be disappointed. Just as his prelude closed, one  of the young soldiers turned upon his elbow, and whispered  contemptuously to his neighbor: \"Always _olives_, always _peace_: that's  all your music's good for!\"    The boy spoke too loud, and Homer caught the discontented tone and words  with an ear quicker than the speaker had given him credit for. He ended  the prelude with a sudden crash on the strings, and said shortly, \"And  what is better to sing of than the olive?\"    The more courteous Philistines looked sternly on the young soldier; but  he had gone too far to be frightened, and he flashed back: \"War is  better. My broadsword is better. If I could sing, I would sing to your  Ares; we call him Mars!\"    Homer smiled gravely. \"Let it be so,\" said he; and, in a lower tone, to  the captain, who was troubled at the breach of courtesy, he added, \"Let  the boy see what war and Mars are for.\"    He struck another prelude and began. Then was it that Homer composed his  \"Hymn to Mars.\" In wild measure, and impetuous, he swept along through  the list of Mars's titles and attributes; then his key changed, and his  hearers listened more intently, more solemnly, as in a graver strain,  with slower music, and an almost awed dignity of voice, the bard went  on.--                \"Helper of mortals, hear!               As thy fires give          The present boldnesses that strive               In youth for honor;      So would I likewise wish to have the power        To keep off from my head thy bitter hour,      And quench the false fire of my soul's low kind,      By the fit ruling of my highest mind I            Control that sting of wealth      That stirs me on still to the horrid scath            Of hideous battle!        \"Do thou, O ever blessed! give me still      Presence of mind to put in act my will,            Whate'er the occasion be;      And so to live, unforced by any fear,      Beneath those laws of peace, that never are      Affected with pollutions popular            Of unjust injury,      As to bear safe the burden of hard fates,      Of foes inflexive, and inhuman hates!\"    The tones died away; the company was hushed for a moment; and the old  chief then said gravely to his petulant follower, \"That is what _men_  fight for, boy.\" But the boy did not need the counsel. Homer's manner,  his voice, the music itself, the spirit of the song, as much as the  words, had overcome him; and the boasting soldier was covering his tears  with his hands.    Homer felt at once (the prince of gentlemen he) that the little  outbreak, and the rebuke of it, had jarred the ease of their unexpected  meeting. How blessed is the presence of mind with which the musician of  real genius passes from song to song, \"whate'er the occasion be!\" With  the ease of genius he changed the tone of his melody again, and sang his  own hymn, \"To Earth, the Mother of all.\"    The triumphant strain is one which harmonizes with every sentiment; and  he commanded instantly the rapt attention of the circle. So engrossed  was he, that he did not seem to observe, as he sang, an addition to  their company of some soldiers from above in the valley, just _as_ he  entered on the passage:--                 \"Happy, then, are they          Whom thou, O great in reverence!      Are bent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"in sounding this bay,  that the ship drove past, which made it necessary to call the boats on  board to tow her off from the northern point. But this service was  performed by a breeze of wind, which, that moment, sprung up at S.W.; so  that as the boats got on board, we hoisted them in, and then bore up for  the north side of the island, intending once more to try to get round by  the east; Mr Gilbert informed me, that at the south part of the bay, he  found no soundings till close to a steep stone beach, where he landed to  taste a stream of water he saw there, which proved to be salt. Some people  were seen there, but they kept at a distance. Farther down the coast, that  is to the north, he found twenty, twenty-four, and thirty fathoms,  three-fourths of a mile, or a mile, from shore, the bottom a fine dark sand.    On the 3d, at sun-rise, we found ourselves abreast a lofty promontory on  the S.E. side of the island, and about three leagues from it. Having but  little wind, and that from the south, right in our teeth, and being in want  of fire-wood, I sent Lieutenant Clerke with two boats to a small islet  which lies off the promontory, to endeavour to get some. In the mean time  we continued to ply up with the ship; but what we gained by our sails, we  lost by the current. At length towards noon, we got a breeze at E.S.E., and  E., with which we could lie up for the head; and soon after Mr Clerke  returned, having not been able to land, on account of a high surf on the  shore. They met with no people on the isle; but saw a large bat, and some  birds, and caught a water-snake. At six o'clock p.m. we got in with the  land, under the N.W. side of the head, where we anchored in seventeen  fathoms water, the bottom a fine dark sand, half a mile from shore; the  point of the head bearing N. 18 deg. E., distant half a league; the little  islet before-mentioned N.E. by E. 1/2 E., and the N.W. point of the bay N.  32 deg. W. Many people appeared on the shore, and some attempted to swim off to  us; but having occasion to send the boat ahead to sound, they retired as  she drew near them. This, however, gave us a favourable idea of them.    On the 4th, at day-break, I went with two boats to examine the coast, to  look for a proper landing-place, wood, and water. At this time, the natives  began to assemble on the shore, and by signs invited us to land. I went  first to a small beach, which is towards the head, where I found no good  landing, on account of some rocks which every where lined the coast. I,  however, put the boat's bow to the shore, and gave cloth, medals, etc. to  some people who were there. For this treatment they offered to haul the  boats over the breakers to the sandy beach, which I thought a friendly  offer, but had reason afterwards to alter my opinion. When they found I  would not do as they desired, they made signs for us to go down into the  bay, which we accordingly did, and they ran along shore abreast of us,  their number increasing prodigiously. I put in to the shore in two or three  places, but, not liking the situation, did not land. By this time, I  believe, the natives conceived what I wanted, as they directed me round a  rocky point, where, on a fine sandy beach, I stepped out of the boat  without wetting a foot, in the face of a vast multitude, with only a green  branch in my hand, which I had before got from one of them. I took but one  man out of the boat with me, and ordered the other boat to lie-to at a  little distance off. They received me with great courtesy and politeness;  and would retire back from the boat on my making the least motion with my  hand. A man, whom I took to be a chief, seeing this, made them form a  semicircle round the boat's bow, and beat such as attempted to break  through this order. This man I loaded with presents, giving likewise to  others, and asked by signs for fresh water, in hopes of seeing where they  got it. The chief immediately sent a man for some, who ran to a house, and  presently returned with a little in a bamboo; so that I gained but little  information by this. I next asked, by the same means, for something to eat,  and they as readily brought me a yam, and some cocoa-nuts. In short, I was  charmed with their behaviour; and the only thing which could give the least  suspicion was, that most of them were armed with clubs, spears, darts, and  bows and arrows. For this reason I kept my eye continually upon the chief,  and watched his looks as well as his actions. He made many signs to me to  haul the boat up upon the shore, and at last slipped into the crowd, where  I observed him speak to several people, and then return to me, repeating  signs to haul the boat up, and hesitating a good deal before he would  receive some spike-nails, which I then offered him. This made me suspect  something was intended, and immediately I stepped into the boat, telling  them by signs that I should soon return. But they were not for parting so  soon, and now attempted by force, what they could not obtain by gentler  means. The gang-board happened unluckily to be laid out for me to come into  the boat, I say unluckily, for if it had not been out, and if the crew had  been a little quicker in getting the boat off, the natives might not have  had time to put their design in execution, nor would the following  disagreeable scene have happened. As we were putting off the boat, they  laid hold of the gang-board, and unhooked it off the boat's stern. But as  they did not take it away, I thought this had been done by accident, and  ordered the boat in again to take it up. Then they themselves hooked it  over the boat's stern, and attempted to haul her ashore; others, at the  same time, snatched the oars out of the people's hands. On my pointing a  musket at them, they in some measure desisted, but returned in an instant,  seemingly determined to haul the boat ashore. At the head of this party was  the chief; the others, who could not come at the boat, stood behind with  darts, stones, and bows and arrows in hand, ready to support them. Signs  and threats having no effect, our own safety became the only consideration;  and yet I was unwilling to fire on the multitude, and resolved to make the  chief alone fall a victim to his own treachery; but my musket at this  critical moment missed fire. Whatever idea they might have formed of the  arms we held in our hands, they must now have looked upon them as childish  weapons, and began to let us see how much better theirs were, by throwing  stones and darts, and by shooting arrows. This made it absolutely necessary  for me to give orders to fire. The first discharge threw them into  confusion; but a second was hardly sufficient to drive them off the beach;  and after all, they continued to throw stones from behind the trees and  bushes, and, every now and then, to pop out and throw a dart. Four lay, to  all appearance, dead on the shore; but two of them afterwards crawled into  the bushes. Happy it was for these people, that not half our muskets would  go off, otherwise many more must have fallen. We had one man wounded in the  cheek with a dart, the point of which was as thick as my finger, and yet it  entered above two inches, which shews that it must have come with great  force, though indeed we were very near them. An arrow struck Mr Gilbert's  naked breast, who was about thirty yards off; but probably it had struck  something before; for it hardly penetrated the skin. The arrows were  pointed with hard wood.    As soon as we got on board, I ordered the anchor to be weighed, with a view  of anchoring near the landing-place. While this was doing, several people  appeared on the low rock point, displaying two oars we had lost in the  scuffle. I looked on this as a sign of submission, and of their wanting to  give us the oars. I was, nevertheless, prevailed on to fire a four-pound  shot at them, to let them see the effect of our great guns. The ball fell  short, but frightened them so much, that none were seen afterwards; and  they left the oars standing up against the bushes.    It was now calm; but the anchor was hardly at the bow before a breeze  sprung up at north, of which we took the advantage, set our sails, and  plyed out of the bay, as it did not seem capable of supplying our wants  with that conveniency I wished to have. Besides, I always had it in my  power to return to this place, in case I should find none more convenient  farther south.    These islanders seemed to be a different race from those of Mallicollo; and  spoke a different language. They are of the middle size, have a good shape,  and tolerable features. Their colour is very dark, and they paint their  faces, some with black, and others with red pigment. Their hair is very  curly and crisp, and somewhat woolly. I saw a few women, and I thought them  ugly; they wore a kind of petticoat made of palm-leaves, or some plant like  it. But the men, like those of Mallicollo, were in a manner naked; having  only the belt about the waist, and the piece of cloth, or leaf, used as a  wrapper*. I saw no canoes with these people, nor were any seen in any part  of this island. They live in houses covered with thatch, and their  plantations are laid out by a line, and fenced round.    [* The particular manner of applying the wrapper may be seen in Wafer's  voyage, who mentions this singular custom as existing, though with some  little variation, amongst the Indians of the Isthmus of Darien.  See Wafer's Voyage, p. 140.]    At two o'clock in the afternoon, we were clear of the bay, bore up round  the head, and steered S.S.E. for the south end of the island, having a fine  breeze at N.W. On the S.W. side of the head is a pretty deep bay, which  seemed to run in behind the one on the N.W. side. Its shores are low, and  the adjacent lands appeared very fertile. It is exposed to the S.E. winds;  for which reason, until it be better known, the N.W. bay is preferable, "]]]
