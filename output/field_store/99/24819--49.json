I am quite sure they are being killed by natives of the island and    that at least one collector supplies birds for museums. We are    trying to get evidence of this.      \"I believe if the heath hen is to be increased in numbers and brought    back to this country, we shall have to have more than one warden on    the reservation and, eventually, we shall have to establish the bird    on the mainland also.\"    [Illustration: PINNATED GROUSE, OR \"PRAIRIE CHICKEN\"  From the \"American Natural History\"]    THE PINNATED GROUSE, SAGE GROUSE AND PRAIRIE SHARP-TAIL.--In view of the  fate of the grouse of the United States, as it has been wrought out thus  far in all the more thickly settled areas, and particularly in view of  the history of the heath hen, we have no choice but to regard all three  of the species named above as absolutely certain to become totally  extinct, within a short period of years, unless the conditions  surrounding them are immediately and radically changed for the better.  Personally, I do not believe that the gunners and game-hogs of  Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California  will permit any one of those species to be saved.    If the present open seasons prevail in the states that I have mentioned  above, no power on earth can save those three species of grouse from the  fate of the heath hen. To-day their representatives exist only in small  shreds and patches, and from fully nineteen-twentieths of their original  ranges they are forever gone.    The sage grouse will be the first species to go. It is the largest, the  most conspicuous, the one most easily found, and the biggest mark for  the gunner. Those who have seen this bird in its native sage-brush well  understand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter.    Many appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse; but the  open seasons continue. The gunners of the states in which a few remnants  still exist are determined to have them, all; and the state legislatures  seem disposed to allow the killers to have their way. It may be  however, that like New York with the heath hen, they will arouse and  virtuously lock the stable door--after the horse has been stolen!    [Illustration: SAGE GROUSE  The First of the Upland Game Birds that will Become Extinct]    THE SNOWY EGRET AND AMERICAN EGRET, (_Egretta candidissima and Herodias  egretta_).--These unfortunate birds, cursed for all time by the  commercially valuable \"aigrette\" plumes that they bear, have had a very  narrow escape from total extinction in the United States, despite all  the efforts made to save them. The \"plume-hunters\" of the millinery  trade have been, _and still are_, determined to have the last feather  and the last drop of egret blood. In an effort to stop the slaughter in  at least one locality in Florida, Warden Guy Bradley was killed by a  plume-hunter, who of course escaped all punishment through the  heaven-born \"sympathy\" of a local jury.    Of the bloody egret slaughter in Florida, not one-tenth of the whole  story ever has been told. Millions of adult birds,--all there  were,--were killed _in the breeding season_, when the plumes were ripe  for the market; and millions of young birds starved in their nests. It  was a common thing for a rookery of several hundred birds to be attacked  by the plume-hunters, and in two or three days utterly destroyed. The  same bloody work is going on to-day in Venezuela and Brazil; and the  stories and \"affidavits\" stating that the millions of egret plumes being  shipped annually from those countries are \"shed feathers,\" \"picked up  off the ground,\" are absolute lies. The men who have sworn to those lies  are perjurers, and should be punished for their crimes. (See Chapter  XIII).    By 1908, the plume-hunters had so far won the fight for the egrets that  Florida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the Colorado  desert.    Until Mr. E.A. McIlhenny's egret preserve, at Avery Island, Louisiana,  became a pronounced success, we had believed that our two egrets soon  would become totally extinct in the United States. But Mr. McIlhenny has  certainly saved those birds to our fauna. In 1892 he started an egret  and heron preserve, close beside his house on Avery Island. By 1900 it  was an established success. To-day 20,000 pairs of egrets and herons are  living and breeding in that bird refuge, and the two egret species are  safe in at least one spot in our own country.    [Illustration: SNOWY EGRETS IN THE McILHENNY EGRET PRESERVE  It is at This Period That the Parent Birds are Killed for Their Plumes,  and the Young Starve in the Nest  Photo by E.A. McIlhenny]    Three years ago, I think there were not many bird-lovers in the United  States, who believed it possible to prevent the total extinction of both  egrets from our fauna. All the known rookeries accessible to  plume-hunters had been totally destroyed. Two years ago, the secret  discovery of several small, hidden colonies prompted William Dutcher,  President of the National Association of Audubon Societies, and Mr. T.  Gilbert Pearson, Secretary, to attempt the protection of those colonies.  With a fund contributed for the purpose, wardens were hired and duly  commissioned. As previously stated, one of those wardens was shot dead  in cold blood by a plume hunter. The task of guarding swamp rookeries  from the attacks of money-hungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumes  were worth their weight in gold, is a very chancy proceeding. There is  now one warden in Florida who says that \"before they get my rookery they  will first have to get me.\"    Thus far the protective work of the Audubon Association has been  successful. Now there are twenty colonies, which contain all told, about  5,000 egrets and about 120,000 herons and ibises which are guarded by  the Audubon wardens. One of the most important is on Bird Island, a mile  out in Orange Lake, central Florida, and it is ably defended by Oscar E.  Baynard. To-day, the plume hunters who do not dare to raid the guarded  rookeries are trying to study out the lines of flight of the birds, to  and from their feeding-grounds, and shoot them in transit. Their motto  is--\"Anything to beat the law, and get the plumes.\" It is there that the  state of Florida should take part in the war.    The success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year a  number of egrets were seen in eastern Massachusetts--for the first time  in many years. And so to-day the question is, can the wardens continue  to hold the plume-hunters at bay?    THE WOOD-DUCK (_Aix sponsa_), by many bird-lovers regarded as the most  beautiful of all American birds, is threatened with extinction, in all  the states that it still inhabits with the exception of eight. Long ago  (1901) the U.S. Biological Survey sounded a general alarm for this  species by the issue of a special bulletin regarding its disappearance,  and advising its protection by long close seasons. To their everlasting  honor, eight states responded, by the enactment of long close-season  laws. This, is the    ROLL OF HONOR    CONNECTICUT  MAINE  MASSACHUSETTS  NEW HAMPSHIRE  NEW JERSEY  NEW YORK  VERMONT  WEST VIRGINIA    [Illustration: WOOD DUCK  Regularly Killed as \"Food\" in 15 States]    And how is it with the other states that number the wood-duck in their  avian faunas? I am ashamed to tell; but it is necessary that the truth  should be known.    Surely we will find that if the other states have not the grace to  protect this bird on account of its exquisite beauty they will not  penalize it by extra long open seasons.    _A number of them have taken pains to provide extra long_ OPEN _seasons  on this species, usually of five or six months!!_ And this for a bird so  exquisitely beautiful that shooting it for the table is like dining on  birds of paradise.

The above are the states that really possess the wood-duck and that  should give it, one and all, a series of five-year close seasons. Now,  is not the record something to blush for?    Is there in those fifteen states _nothing_ too beautiful or too good to  go into the pot?           *        *        *        *        *    THE WOODCOCK _(Philohela minor)_, is a bird regarding which my  bird-hunting friends and I do not agree.
