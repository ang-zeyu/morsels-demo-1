I despise the Pallid Cuckoo,  A disreputable \"crook\" who     Shirks her duties for a lazy life of ease.  I abhor her mournful call,  Which is not a song at all     But a cross between a whimper and a wheeze.        THE SAILOR    I'd like to be a sailor--a sailor bold and bluff--  Calling out, \"Ship ahoy!\" in manly tones and gruff.  I'd learn to box the compass, and to reef and tack and luff;  I'd sniff and snifff the briny breeze and never get enough.  Perhaps I'd chew tobacco, or an old black pipe I'd puff,     But I wouldn't be a sailor if . . .         The sea was very rough.           Would you?        THE FAMINE    Cackle and lay, cackle and lay!  How many eggs did you get to-day?  None in the manger, and none in the shed,  None in the box where the chickens are fed,  None in the tussocks and none in the tub,  And only a little one out in the scrub.  Oh, I say!  Dumplings to-day.  I fear that the hens must be laying away.        THE FEAST    Cackle and lay, cackle and lay!  How many eggs did you get to-day?  Two in the manger, and four in the shed,  Six in the box where the chickens are fed,  Two in the tussocks and ten in the tub,  And nearly two dozen right out in the scrub.  Hip, hooray!  Pudding to-day!  I think that the hens are beginning to lay.        UPON THE ROAD TO ROCKABOUT    Upon the road to Rockabout  I came upon some sheep--  A large and woolly flock about  As wide as it was deep.    I was about to turn about  To ask the man to tell  Some things I wished to learn about  Both sheep and wool as well,    When I beheld a rouseabout  Who lay upon his back  Beside a little house about  A furlong from the track.    I had a lot to talk about,  And said to him \"Good day.\"  But he got up to walk about,  And so I went away--        A CHANGE OF AIR    Now, a man in Oodnadatta  He grew fat, and he grew fatter,     Though he hardly had a thing to eat for dinner;  While a man in Booboorowie  Often sat and wondered how he     Could prevent himself from growing any thinner.    So the man from Oodnadatta     He came down to Booboorowie,  Where he rapidly grew flatter;     And the folk will tell you how he  Urged the man from Booboorowie     To go up to Oodnadatta--  Where he lived awhile, and now he     Is considerably fatter.        POLLY DIBBS    Mrs Dibbs--Polly Dibbs,     Standing at a tub,  Washing other people's clothes--     Rub-Rub-Rub.  Poor, old, skinny arms     White with soapy foam--  At night she takes her shabby hat     And goes off home.    Mrs Dibbs--Polly Dibbs--     Is not very rich.  She goes abroad all day to scrub,     And home at night to stitch.  She wears her shabby hat awry,     Perched on a silly comb;  And people laugh at Polly Dibbs     As she goes home.    Mrs Dibbs--Mother Dibbs--     Growing very old,  Says, \"it's a hard world!\"     And sniffs and drats the cold.  She says it is a cruel world,     A weary world to roam.  But God will smile on Polly Dibbs     When she goes Home.        * * *    I suspect the Kookaburra,  For his methods are not thorough  In his highly praised campaign against the snakes.  And the small birds, one and all,  Curse him for a cannibal--  Though he certainly is cheerful when he wakes.    * * *        LULLABY    You are much too big to dandle,  And I will not leave the candle.     Go to sleep.  You are growing naughty, rather,  And I'll have to speak to father.     Go to sleep!  If you're good I shall not tell, then.  Oh, a story?  Very well, then.     Once upon a time, a king, named Crawley Creep,  Had a very lovely daughter . . . .  You don't want a drink of water!     Go to sleep! There! There! Go to sleep.        * * *    I wonder why I wear a tie. It is not warm to wear;  But if I left it off someone would say it was not there.    I wonder, if I took a whiff of father's pipe for fun,  Would I be big and strong like him, or just his small, sick son?    I wonder when our old white hen will know her squawk betrays her.  I think she lets us find her eggs just so that we shall praise her.    * * *        THE PUBLISHER    I'd like to be a publisher, And publish massive tomes  Written in a massive style by blokes with massive domes--  Science books, and histories of Egypt's day and Rome's,  Books of psycho-surgery to mine the minds of momes,  And solemn pseudo-psychic stuff to tell where Topsy roams  When her poor clay is put away beneath the spreading holms;  Books about electrocuting little seeds with ohms  To sternly show them how to grow in sands, and clays, and loams,  And bravely burst infinitives, like angry agronomes;  Books on breeding aeroplanes and airing aerodromes,  On bees that buzz in bonnets and the kind that build the combs,  Made plain with pretty pictures done in crimsons, mauves, and chromes;  And diagrams to baulk the brain of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.  I'd set the scientists to work like superheated gnomes,  And make them write and write and write until the printer foams  And lino men, made \"loony\", go to psychopathic homes.  I'd publish books, I would--large books on ants and antinomes  And palimpsests and palinodes and pallid pallindromes:     But I wouldn't be a publisher if . . . .                 I got many \"pomes.\"                                   Would you?        GOOD NIGHT    And so, Good Night. I'm rather tired.  I hardly thought I'd be required     To draw a lot of pictures, too,     When I arranged to write for you.  I found it hard, but did my best;  And now I need a little rest.     If you are pleased, why, that's all right.     I'm rather tired. And so               GOOD NIGHT!        This very charming gentleman, extremely old and gruff,  He slowly shook his head and took a great big pinch of snuff,  Then he spluttered and he muttered and he loudly shouted \"Fie!  To tear your books is wicked sir! and likewise all my eye!\"  I don't know what he meant by that. He had such piercing eyes.  And, he said, \"Mark--ME--boy! Books will make you wise.\"    This very charming gentleman said, \"Hum,\" and \"Hoity, Toit!  A book is not a building block, a cushion or a quoit.  Soil your books and spoil your books? Is that the thing to do?  Gammon, sir! and Spinach, sir! And Fiddle-faddle, too!\"  He blinked so quick, and thumped his stick, then gave me such a stare.  And he said, \"Mark--ME--boy! BOOKS--NEED--CARE!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#9)"],[1,"\"My friend,\" responded the gentleman earnestly, \"the world is full of  Christian men and women who are trying to help others.\"    Just then my mother said to me, \"When I hear the beautiful words that  minister speaks and see what he is doing, then indeed do I believe that  human beings have hearts.\"    As we resumed our journey I wondered if Growler would profit by the  sunshiny example of Cheery and the devotion of the parson of St. Thomas.    Later in our travels we came upon some old acquaintances.   Our  stopping-place was near an ancient house on a mountain side.  The  outlook was the grandest I had ever seen, and though I have traveled  much since then I have never found anything to exceed it in beauty.  A  glistening river wound its way in a big loop at the foot of the  mountain, and beyond it lay stretched out a busy city.    A good many years before a battle had been fought on these heights,  which people still remembered and talked about.  I heard them speak of  it as the \"Battle above the clouds.\"  There was still a part of a  cannon wagon in the yard which visitors came to see and examined with  much interest.  They also often requested the landlady to let them look  at the walls of an old stone dairy adjoining the house, because the  soldiers had carved their names there.    To me it seemed strange that the guests would sit for hours on the long  gallery of this hotel, and go over and over the incidents of the  battle, telling where this regiment stood, or where that officer fell,  as if war and the taking of life were the most pleasant rather than the  most distressful subjects in the world.  In the distance was a mammoth  field of graves, miles of graves, beautifully kept mounds under which  lay the dead heroes of that sad time.    The days up here were beautiful, but it was at night that this was a  scene of surpassing loveliness.  Far below the lights of the city  glowed like spangles in the darkness.  Above us was the star-encrusted  sky.  It was like being suspended between a floor and a ceiling of  glittering jewels.    On this plateau grew the biggest cherry trees I ever saw, and they bore  the biggest and sweetest cherries, though I could not taste any at that  time, as the season was past.  I heard the landlady complaining one day  to some of her guests that the rascally birds had hardly left her a  cherry to put up.    \"The saucy little thieves! they must have eaten bushels of the finest  fruit,\" she said.    \"And didn't you get any?\" inquired a childish voice.  There was  something familiar in the voice and I flew to the porch railing to see  who it was.  And who should it be but dear little Marion.  And there  too was her aunty, Miss Dorothy, and the professor, and in the parlor I  caught a glimpse of Miss Katie and the colonel.  They were having a  pleasant vacation together.    Marion looked inquiringly into the landlady's face.  No doubt she was  thinking the mountain birds were very greedy to eat up all the cherries  and not leave one for the poor woman to can.    \"Our birds always eat some of our cherries too,\" she said, \"but they  always leave us plenty.\"    \"There were bushels left on our trees,\" observed the landlady's  daughter.  \"We had all we wanted, mother.  We couldn't possibly have  used the rest if the birds had not eaten them.  We had a cellar full of  canned cherries left over from the year before, you remember, and that  is the way it is nearly every year.\"    \"Yes, yes, I know,\" answered her mother impatiently; \"but for all that  I don't believe in letting the birds have everything.\"    \"I never begrudge a bird what it eats,\" commented the professor.  \"Of  course you can discourage the birds, drive them off, break up their  nests, starve them out, and have a crop of caterpillars instead of  cherries.  But, beg pardon, madam, maybe you don't object to  caterpillars,\" and he bowed low to the landlady.    The laugh was against her and I was glad of it, for I didn't consider  it either kind or polite to call us \"saucy little thieves.\"    We were amused one morning when, flying over a piece of pretty country,  we saw a lady moving rapidly along on the red sandy path below.  She  seemed to be neither exactly riding nor walking, as she was not on foot  nor had she a horse.  On closer inspection it was seen that she was  propelling a strange-looking vehicle.  Two of her carriage wheels were  gone, and between the remaining two the lady was perched.  At sight of  it I was immediately reminded of the queer thing that Johnny Morris  rode which the admiral had described to us and called a \"wheel.\"  I  felt sure that this was the same kind of a machine.  The lady looked  neither to the right nor to the left, but her glance was fixed intently  on the road before her.    Farther along another lady leaned against the fence awaiting her  approach.  As she bowled along the friend asked enthusiastically: \"Is  it not splendid?\"    The rider called back to her: \"It is grand!  It is almost as if I were  flying.  I know now how a bird feels.\"    Think of comparing the sensation produced by moving that heavy iron  machine, with the rider but three feet from the ground, to the  exhilaration felt by a bird spurning the earth and soaring on delicate  wing through the fields of heaven!  It was truly laughable!    Our amusement was cut short, however, when we noticed that the lady's  hat was decorated with a dead dove.    \"Can we never get away from this millinery exhibition of death?\" I  exclaimed in horror.    \"No,\" said my mother sorrowfully.  \"The god, Fashion, I told you of has  his slaves all over the land.  We will find them wherever we go, north,  south, east, and west.  No town is too small, no neighborhood too  remote, but there will be found women ready to carry out his cruel  laws.\"    Had we not been haunted by this vision of death which we were  constantly meeting wherever women were congregated, we might have been  happy in the fair land of rose blossoms and magnolias where we now  sojourned.  The air was soft and balmy, and the atmosphere filled us  with a serene, restful languor quite new to those who had been  accustomed to the brisker habits of a colder clime.  Besides the birds  there were many human visitors from the North spending the winter  months here.  Some sought this warmer climate for their health, others  for pleasure, and these also soon fell into the easy-going,  happy-go-lucky ways induced by the sluggish climate.    Among the birds the waxwings most readily acquired this delightful  Southern habit of taking life easy.  In fact the waxwings are inclined  to be lazy, except when they are nesting; they are the most deliberate  creatures one can find, but very foppish and neat in their dress.  Never will you find a particle of dust on their silky plumage, and the  pretty red dots on their wings and tails look always as bright as if  kept in a bandbox.  They have, indeed, just reason to be proud of  themselves, for they are very beautiful.    Hunters by scores were after them with bag and gun mercilessly killing  them for the New York millinery houses.  The slaughter was terrible,  and made more easy for the hunters by reason of the poor birds flocking  together so closely in such large numbers when they alighted in circles  as is their habit.  As they came down in dense droves to get their  food, the red dots on their wing tips almost overlapping those of their  fellows, dozens were slain by a single shot.  They were very fond of  the berries of the cedar trees, and after the other foods were gone  they hovered there in great numbers.  Here too, the hunters followed  them and made awful havoc in their ranks.  One man made the cruel boast  that the winter previous he had killed one thousand cedar-birds for hat  trimmings.    Many of our family had located for a time near the coast, but here too,  on these sunny plains, the death messengers followed us and slew us by  the thousands.    We learned that one bird man handled thirty thousand bird skins that  season.  Another firm shipped seventy thousand to the city, and still  the market called for more and yet more.  The appetite of the god could  not be appeased.    I am sure this account of the loss of bird life must have seemed  appalling to my mother, for I heard her moan sadly when it was talked  about.    It was during my stay in the Southern islands that I first saw the  white egret, whose beautiful sweeping plumes, like the silken train of  a court lady, have so long been the spoils of woman, that the bird is  almost extinct.  As these magnificent feathers appear upon the bird  only through the mating and nesting season, the cruelty of the act is  still more dastardly.  The attachment of the parent birds for their  young is very beautiful to witness, yet this devotion, which should be  their safeguard, is seized upon for their destruction, for so great is  the instinct of protecting love they refuse to leave their young when  danger is near, and are absolutely indifferent to their own safety.    Never shall I forget one sad incident which occurred while I was there.  Overhanging the water was an ancestral nest belonging to a family of  egrets which had occupied it for some seasons.  Unlike the American  human species, in whom local attachment is not largely developed, and  who take a new house every moving day, the egret repairs and fixes over  the old house year after year, putting in a new brace there, adding  another stick here, to make it firm enough to bear the weight of the  mother and the three young birds which always comprise the brood.    The three pale-blue eggs in this nest had been duly hatched, and the  fond mother was now brooding over her darlings with every demonstration  of maternal affection.  She was a beautiful creature with her graceful  movement, her train of plumes, and her long neck gracefully curved.    The quick sharp boom, boom of the guns had been echoing through the  swamp for"]]]
