In all, there is an  admirable mixture of human virtues and passions with religious  raptures. The truth is, continues Dr. Sprat, methinks in other matters  his wit exceeded all other men's, but in his moral and divine works it  out-did itself; and no doubt it proceeded from this cause, that in the  lighter kinds of poetry he chiefly represented the humours and  affections of others; but in these he sat to himself, and drew the  figure of his own mind. We have the first book of the Davideis  translated out of English into very elegant Latin by Mr. Cowley  himself.\" Dr. Sprat says of his Latin poetry, \"that he has expressed  to admiration all the numbers of verse and figures of poetry, that are  scattered up and down amongst the ancients; and that there is hardly  to be found in them any good fashion of speech, or colour of measure;  but he has comprehended it, and given instances of it, according as  his several arguments required either a majestic spirit, or  passionate, or pleasant. This he observes, is the more extraordinary,  in that it was never yet performed by any single poet of the ancient  Romans themselves.\"    The same author has told us, that the occasion of Mr. Cowley's falling  on the pindarique way of writing, was his accidentally meeting with  Pindar's works in a place where he had no other books to direct him.  Having thus considered at leisure the heighth of his invention, and  the majesty of his stile, he tried immediately to imitate it in  English, and he performed it, says the Dr. without the danger that  Horace presaged to the man that should attempt it. Two of our greatest  poets, after allowing Mr. Cowley to have been a successful imitator of  Pindar, yet find fault with his numbers. Mr. Dryden having told us,  that our author brought Pindaric verse as near perfection as possible  in so short a time, adds, \"But if I may be allowed to speak my mind  modestly, and without injury to his sacred ashes, somewhat of the  purity of English, somewhat of more sweetness in the numbers, in a  word, somewhat of a finer turn and more lyrical verse is yet wanting;\"  and Mr. Congreve having excepted against the irregularity of the  measure of the English Pindaric odes, yet observes, \"that the beauty  of Mr. Cowley's verses are an attonement for the irregularity of his  stanzas; and tho' he did nor imitate Pindar in the strictness of his  numbers, he has very often happily copied him in the force of his  figures, and sublimity of his stile and sentiments.\"    Soon after his return to England, he was seized upon thro' mistake;  the search being intended after another gentleman of considerable note  in the King's party. The Republicans, who were sensible how much they  needed the assistance and coalition of good men, endeavoured sometimes  by promises, and sometimes by threatning, to bring our author over to  their interest; but all their attempts proving fruitless, he was  committed to a severe confinement, and with some difficulty at last  obtained his liberty, after giving a thousand pounds bail, which Dr.  Scarborough in a friendly manner took upon himself. Under these bonds  he continued till Cromwell's death, when he ventured back into France,  and there remained, as Dr. Sprat says, in the same situation as  before, till near the time of the King's return. This account is a  sufficient vindication of Mr. Cowley's unshaken loyalty, which some  called in question; and as this is a material circumstance in the life  of Cowley, we shall give an account of it in the words of the elegant  writer of his life just now mentioned, as it is impossible to set it  in a fairer, or more striking light than is already done by that  excellent prelate. \"The cause of his loyalty being called in question,  he tells us, was a few lines in a preface to one of his books; the  objection, says he, I must not pass in silence, because it was the  only part of his life that was liable to misinterpretation, even by  the confession of those that envied his fame.    \"In this case it were enough to alledge for him to men of moderate  minds, that what he there said was published before a book of poetry;  and so ought rather to be esteemed as a problem of his fancy and  invention, than as a real image of his judgement; but his defence in  this matter may be laid on a surer foundation. This is the true reason  to be given of his delivering that opinion: Upon his coming over he  found the state of the royal party very desperate. He perceived the  strength of their enemies so united, that till it should begin to  break within itself, all endeavours against it were like to prove  unsuccessful. On the other side he beheld their zeal for his Majesty's  cause to be still so active, that often hurried them into inevitable  ruin. He saw this with much grief; and tho' he approved their  constancy as much as any man living, yet he found their unreasonable  shewing it, did only disable themselves, and give their adversaries  great advantages of riches and strength by their defeats. He therefore  believed it would be a meritorious service to the King, if any man who  was known to have followed his interest, could insinuate into the  Usurper's minds, that men of his principles, were now willing to be  quiet, and could persuade the poor oppressed Royalists to conceal  their affections for better occasions. And as for his own particular,  he was a close prisoner when he writ that against which the exception  is made; so that he saw it was impos[s]ible for him to pursue the ends  for which he came hither, if he did not make some kind of declaration  of his peaceable intentions. This was then his opinon; and the success  of the thing seems to prove that it was not ill-grounded. For  certainly it was one of the greatest helps to the King's affairs about  the latter end of that tyranny, that many of his best friends  dissembled their counsels, and acted the same designs under the  disguises and names of other parties. The prelate concludes this  account with observing, that, that life must needs be very  unblameable, which had been tried in business of the highest  consequence, and practised in the hazardous secrets of courts and  cabinets, and yet there can nothing disgraceful be produced against  it, but only the error of one paragraph, and single metaphor.\"    About the year 1662, his two Books of Plants were published, to which  he added afterwards four more, and all these together, with his Latin  poems, were printed in London, 1678; his Books on Plants was written  during his residence in England, in the time of the usurpation, the  better to distinguish his real intention, by the study of physic, to  which he applied.    It appears by Wood's Fasti Oxon. that our poet was created Dr. of  Physic at Oxford, December 2, 1657, by virtue of a mandamus from the  then government. After the King's restoration, Mr. Cowley, being then  past the 4Oth year of his age, the greatest part of which had been  spent in a various and tempestuous condition, resolved to pass the  remainder of his life in a studious retirement: In a letter to one of  his friends, he talks of making a voyage to America, not from a view  of accumulating wealth, but there to chuse a habitation, and shut  himself up from the busy world for ever. This scheme was wildly  romantic, and discovered some degree of vanity, in the author; for Mr.  Cowley needed but retire a few miles out of town, and cease from  appearing abroad, and he might have been sufficiently secured against  the intrusion of company, nor was he of so much consequence as to be  forced from his retirement; but this visionary scheme could not be  carried into execution, by means of Mr. Cowley's want of money, for he  had never been much on the road of gain. Upon the settlement of the  peace of the nation, he obtained a competent estate, by the favour of  his principal patrons, the duke of Buckingham, and the earl of St.  Albans. Thus furnished for a retreat, he spent the last seven or eight  years of his life in his beloved obscurity, and possessed (says Sprat)  that solitude, which from his very childhood he so passionately  desired. This great poet, and worthy man, died at a house called the  Porch-house, towards the West end of the town of Chertsey in Surry,  July 28, 1667, in the 49th year of his age. His solitude, from the  very beginning, had never agreed so well with the constitution of his  body, as his mind: out of haste, to abandon the tumult of the city, he  had not prepared a healthful situation in the country, as he might  have done, had he been more deliberate in his choice; of this, he soon  began to find the inconvenience at Barn-elms, where he was afflicted  with a dangerous and lingring fever. Shortly after his removal to  Chertsey, he fell into another consuming disease: having languished  under this for some months, he seemed to be pretty well cured of its  ill symptoms, but in the heat of the summer, by staying too long  amongst his labourers in the meadows, he was taken with a violent  defluxion, and stoppage in his breast and throat; this he neglected,  as an ordinary cold, and refused to send for his usual physicians,  'till it was past all remedy, and so in the end, after a fortnight's  sickness, it proved mortal to him.    He was buried in Westminster Abbey, the 3d of August following, near  the ashes of Chaucer and Spenser. King Charles II. was pleased to  bestow upon him the best character, when, upon the news of his death,  his Majesty declared, that Mr. Cowley had not left a better man behind  him in England. A monument was erected to his memory in May 1675, by  George, duke of Buckingham, with a Latin inscription, written by Dr.  Sprat, afterwards lord bishop of Rochester.    Besides Mr. Cowley's works already mentioned, we have, by the fame  hand, A Proposition for the advancement of Experimental Philosophy. A  Discourse, by way of Vision,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#9)"],[1,"be left to bear the brunt of the  malcontents' vengeance when a Republic is established_.    And again on the 9th, from Heidelberg:    _The idea that we should somehow be compelled or induced to abandon  the country had taken great hold on the minds of some of the more  intelligent men that I met_. It has been seduously written up by a  portion of the South African press, English as well as Dutch. I  marked its effect particularly on men who said they had come from the  old Colony since the annexation, but would never have done so had  they believed that English rule would be withdrawn, and the country  left to its former state of anarchy....    _But there is great practical difficulty in conveying to the mass of  the people any idea of the real power of Government_.    It is not possible to pen a more severe and pregnant comment on the  after-policy of England than that suggested by the italicized lines,  written as they were by England's Plenipotentiary--an idea reported  to headquarters, not as a feeler, but as a suggestion so absurd that  it called for no expression of opinion. But he lived to find that it  was not too absurd to be realized; and perhaps, after all, it was  written as a warning, and the wise and cool-headed old statesman in  his inmost soul had a premonition of what eventually occurred.    Sir Bartle Frere met the Boers in their camp, and discussed with them  their grievances. He informed them that he had no power to revoke the  annexation, nor would he recommend it, as, in his judgment, such a  course would be a reversion to chaos and ruin. The Boers pressed  steadily for nothing less than repeal. Sir Bartle Frere reported  the historical meeting at Erasmus Farm to Sir M. Hicks Beach:      _April 14, 1879._    They were evidently much disappointed.... Our meeting separated with  no more definite decision than that they must report to the 'people,'  and be guided by their decision as to what was to be done.    If I may judge from the gentlemen composing the deputation, and  others of their class, whom I have had the honour of meeting since  coming to the Transvaal, the leaders are, with few exceptions, men  who deserve respect and regard for many valuable and amiable  qualities as citizens and subjects....    Of the results of our meeting it is impossible at present to say more  than that it must have cleared away misconceptions on all sides If  they have learnt anything as to the finality of the act of  annexation--that I have no power to undo it, and do not believe that  it will ever be undone, in the only sense in which they will ask  it--I have, on the other hand, been shown the stubbornness of a  determination to be content with nothing else, for which I was not  prepared by the general testimony of officials who had been longer in  the country, and who professed to believe that the opposition of the  Boers was mere bluster, and that they had not the courage of their  professed opinions.... I feel assured that the majority of the  Committee felt very deeply what they believed to be a great national  wrong.... But my conviction is that the real malcontents are far from  being a majority of the whole white population, or even of their own  class of Boer farmers.    I have no doubt whatever that if the Executive were in a position to  assert the supremacy of the law, to put an effectual stop to the  reign of terrorism which exists at present, the discontented minority  would cease to agitate, and would soon cease to feel grievances which  a very brief discussion shows to be in the main sentimental; not the  less keenly felt on that account, but not likely to survive  the prosperity and good government, with a fair measure of  self-government in its train, which are within their reach under  British rule.    And, again, he wrote to Lady Frere:      PRETORIA, _April 20, 1879._    My last letter had not been gone many hours by the mail express when  Lanyon ran into my room, to tell me that the Boer camp was actually  broken up and the Boers dispersing.    I need not tell you how thankful I was. The one thing I dreaded was  civil war and bloodshed, and had a single malcontent been shot, I  should have considered it a greater misfortune than the death of a  dozen Piet Retiefs, or Uys, dying like heroes in the field of battle  for their country and brethren. So you may imagine how thankful I  felt to the Giver of all good, who has guided and protected us  through life.    I am to see a deputation from the Boers' Committee again to-morrow,  and then I hope we shall have done with meetings and grievances--for  the present a phrase which they carefully put into all references to  their breaking up, and which they evidently mean. _It was clear to me  that it was not the annexation, so much as the neglect to fulfil the  promises and the expectations held out by Shepstone when he took  over the Government, that has stirred up the great mass of the  Boers, and given a handle to agitators._{02}    There it is in a single sentence! It was not the annexation which  caused the war; for nine men in every ten admitted that it was  welcomed and justified by considerations of general South African  policy, or else simply inevitable. No! It was the failure to fulfil  the conditions of annexation!    In 'A Narrative of the Boer War,' Mr. Thomas Fortescue Carter has  given with admirable skill and impartiality a full account of the  causes which led to the outbreak. His history is, indeed, so  determinedly just as to have met with considerable disapproval in  quarters where feelings are hot on either side, and where plain  truths are not palatable. Mr. Carter resided in the country for years  before the annexation, and went through the war as correspondent of a  well-known London daily, and this is his opinion:    Anyone who knows the acquaintance Sir T. Shepstone had with the Boers  of the Transvaal, years prior to the annexation, cannot doubt that,  regarded as a friend and almost as one of themselves, no one better  than he could have been selected for the task of ascertaining the  desires of the people; and no one who knows Sir T. Shepstone will  believe that he did not take sufficient evidence to prove to any man  that the Boers were anxious to be extricated from the dilemma they  were in, and really willing at that time that their country should be  annexed. Men who during the late war were our foes were at the time  of the annexation clamouring for it, welcoming Sir Theophilus  Shepstone as the deliverer and saviour of the country. I mention  Swart Dirk Uys, an eminent Boer, who fought against the English in  1880-81, as one amongst the hundreds and thousands who went out to  meet Sir Theophilus Shepstone with palm branches in their hands.    The natural aversion of the people to English rule was overcome for  the moment by their greater aversion to being wiped off the face of  the Transvaal by the blacks; that was a contingency staring them in  the face, and yet not even that imminent common danger availed to  secure unity amongst them, or would rouse men individually to take  upon their shoulders the responsibility which rests upon every member  of a State.    The Boer Volksraad, after promising to appeal to their constituents  on the subject of the new constitution proposed, almost immediately  passed a measure, which was familiarly styled by the people the 'Hou  jou smoel law.' The literal translation of this term is 'Hold your  to discuss the question of either confederation or annexation.    I come to the conclusion, then, that the cause of the annexation was  England's historical greed of territory, especially rich territory;  and that, however unworthy the motive on the part of the visiting  power, the Boers did not at that time receive the visitor with other  feelings than those of satisfaction, and practically surrendered  their country voluntarily and gladly to the ruler of a greater power,  under the impression that Sir Theophilus Shepstone would be permitted  to carry out, and that he therefore would carry out, the promises he  made them. As the programme was open before them, they had everything  to gain and nothing to lose, except the loss entailed by nominal  government by the British. No man, whether Boer or Britisher, who was  living in the Transvaal, or knew the feelings of the Boers at the  time of annexation, would in 1877 have given any other account of the  feeling of the nation; and if I have formed too low an opinion of the  motives of English statesmen at that time, and am not justified in  attributing the annexation to greed instead of to the purer and  nobler desire to protect England's colonies, or even the Transvaal  itself, from the inroads of savages, then my excuse must be that the  failure of England to send out at that time a force equal to the task  of restraining those savages and maintaining peace, has helped  materially to lead me to the unwarrantable conclusion.{03}    And so came the war. The history of it is written that all may read;  and it is not necessary here to refer at length to the details of it.  The utterly unjust treatment of Bezuidenhout at Potchefstroom was the  immediate cause of the outbreak. The armed interference of the  Potchefstroom burghers with the Imperial officials followed on  December 16, to be in turn succeeded by the battle of Bronkhorst  Spruit on the 20th.    The following account of the affair is taken from Mr. Carter's book:    All went well on this day till about 2.30 p.m., when the following  was about the order of march: One mounted infantryman in advance of  the main body next the band; of F company, forty men; of A company,  forty men; then followed the quarter-guard, thirteen men; and  provost-escort and prisoners, twenty-three men. The remainder of the  force was posted along the string of waggons, with the exception of  the rear-guard of about twenty men, which were some distance behind.  Colonel Anstruther, Captains"]]]
