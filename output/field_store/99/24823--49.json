In no way could he  do so. He was unable to depress the shoulder so as to push the elbow  beyond that edge of the timber which was nearest his knees; failing in  that, he could not raise the forearm and hand to grasp the beam. The  brace that made an angle with it downward and backward prevented him  from doing anything in that direction, and between it and his body the  space was not half so wide as the length of his forearm. Obviously he  could not get his hand under the beam nor over it; the hand could not,  in fact, touch it at all. Having demonstrated his inability, he  desisted, and began to think whether he could reach any of the debris  piled upon his legs.    In surveying the mass with a view to determining that point, his  attention was arrested by what seemed to be a ring of shining metal  immediately in front of his eyes. It appeared to him at first to  surround some perfectly black substance, and it was somewhat more than a  half-inch in diameter. It suddenly occurred to his mind that the  blackness was simply shadow and that the ring was in fact the muzzle of  his rifle protruding from the pile of debris. He was not long in  satisfying himself that this was so--if it was a satisfaction. By  closing either eye he could look a little way along the barrel--to the  point where it was hidden by the rubbish that held it. He could see the  one side, with the corresponding eye, at apparently the same angle as  the other side with the other eye. Looking with the right eye, the  weapon seemed to be directed at a point to the left of his head, and  _vice-versa._ He was unable to see the upper surface of the barrel, but  could see the under surface of the stock at a slight angle. The piece  was, in fact, aimed at the exact centre of his forehead.    In the perception of this circumstance, in the recollection that just  previously to the mischance of which this uncomfortable situation was  the result he had cocked the rifle and set the trigger so that a touch  would discharge it, Private Searing was affected with a feeling of  uneasiness. But that was as far as possible from fear; he was a brave  man, somewhat familiar with the aspect of rifles from that point of  view, and of cannon too. And now he recalled, with something like  amusement, an incident of his experience at the storming of Missionary  Ridge, where, walking up to one of the enemy's embrasures from which he  had seen a heavy gun throw charge after charge of grape among the  assailants he had thought for a moment that the piece had been  withdrawn; he could see nothing in the opening but a brazen circle. What  that was he had understood just in time to step aside as it pitched  another peck of iron down that swarming slope. To face firearms is one  of the commonest incidents in a soldier's life--firearms, too, with  malevolent eyes blazing behind them. That is what a soldier is for.  Still, Private Searing did not altogether relish the situation, and  turned away his eyes.    After groping, aimless, with his right hand for a time he made an  ineffectual attempt to release his left. Then he tried to disengage his  head, the fixity of which was the more annoying from his ignorance of  what held it. Next he tried to free his feet, but while exerting the  powerful muscles of his legs for that purpose it occurred to him that a  disturbance of the rubbish which held them might discharge the rifle;  how it could have endured what had already befallen it he could not  understand, although memory assisted him with several instances in  point. One in particular he recalled, in which in a moment of mental  abstraction he had clubbed his rifle and beaten out another gentleman's  brains, observing afterward that the weapon which he had been diligently  swinging by the muzzle was loaded, capped, and at full cock--knowledge  of which circumstance would doubtless have cheered his antagonist to  longer endurance. He had always smiled in recalling that blunder of his  \"green and salad days\" as a soldier, but now he did not smile. He turned  his eyes again to the muzzle of the rifle and for a moment fancied that  it had moved; it seemed somewhat nearer.    Again he looked away. The tops of the distant trees beyond the bounds of  the plantation interested him: he had not before observed how light and  feathery they were, nor how darkly blue the sky was, even among their  branches, where they somewhat paled it with their green; above him it  appeared almost black. \"It will be uncomfortably hot here,\" he thought,  \"as the day advances. I wonder which way I am looking.\"    Judging by such shadows as he could see, he decided that his face was  due north; he would at least not have the sun in his eyes, and north--  well, that was toward his wife and children.    \"Bah!\" he exclaimed aloud, \"what have they to do with it?\"    He closed his eyes. \"As I can't get out I may as well go to sleep. The  rebels are gone and some of our fellows are sure to stray out here  foraging. They'll find me.\"    But he did not sleep. Gradually he became sensible of a pain in his  forehead--a dull ache, hardly perceptible at first, but growing more and  more uncomfortable. He opened his eyes and it was gone--closed them and  it returned. \"The devil!\" he said, irrelevantly, and stared again at the  sky. He heard the singing of birds, the strange metallic note of the  meadow lark, suggesting the clash of vibrant blades. He fell into  pleasant memories of his childhood, played again with his brother and  sister, raced across the fields, shouting to alarm the sedentary larks,  entered the sombre forest beyond and with timid steps followed the faint  path to Ghost Rock, standing at last with audible heart-throbs before  the Dead Man's Cave and seeking to penetrate its awful mystery. For the  first time he observed that the opening of the haunted cavern was  encircled by a ring of metal. Then all else vanished and left him gazing  into the barrel of his rifle as before. But whereas before it had seemed  nearer, it now seemed an inconceivable distance away, and all the more  sinister for that. He cried out and, startled by something in his own  voice--the note of fear--lied to himself in denial: \"If I don't sing out  I may stay here till I die.\"    He now made no further attempt to evade the menacing stare of the gun  barrel. If he turned away his eyes an instant it was to look for  assistance (although he could not see the ground on either side the  ruin), and he permitted them to return, obedient to the imperative  fascination. If he closed them it was from weariness, and instantly the  poignant pain in his forehead--the prophecy and menace of the bullet--  forced him to reopen them.    The tension of nerve and brain was too severe; nature came to his relief  with intervals of unconsciousness. Reviving from one of these he became  sensible of a sharp, smarting pain in his right hand, and when he worked  his fingers together, or rubbed his palm with them, he could feel that  they were wet and slippery. He could not see the hand, but he knew the  sensation; it was running blood. In his delirium he had beaten it  against the jagged fragments of the wreck, had clutched it full of  splinters. He resolved that he would meet his fate more manly. He was a  plain, common soldier, had no religion and not much philosophy; he could  not die like a hero, with great and wise last words, even if there had  been some one to hear them, but he could die \"game,\" and he would. But  if he could only know when to expect the shot!    Some rats which had probably inhabited the shed came sneaking and  scampering about. One of them mounted the pile of debris that held the  rifle; another followed and another. Searing regarded them at first with  indifference, then with friendly interest; then, as the thought flashed  into his bewildered mind that they might touch the trigger of his rifle,  he cursed them and ordered them to go away. \"It is no business of  yours,\" he cried.    The creatures went away; they would return later, attack his face, gnaw  away his nose, cut his throat--he knew that, but he hoped by that time  to be dead.    Nothing could now unfix his gaze from the little ring of metal with its  black interior. The pain in his forehead was fierce and incessant. He  felt it gradually penetrating the brain more and more deeply, until at  last its progress was arrested by the wood at the back of his head. It  grew momentarily more insufferable: he began wantonly beating his  lacerated hand against the splinters again to counteract that horrible  ache. It seemed to throb with a slow, regular recurrence, each pulsation  sharper than the preceding, and sometimes he cried out, thinking he felt  the fatal bullet. No thoughts of home, of wife and children, of country,  of glory. The whole record of memory was effaced. The world had passed  away--not a vestige remained. Here in this confusion of timbers and  boards is the sole universe. Here is immortality in time--each pain an  everlasting life. The throbs tick off eternities.    Jerome Searing, the man of courage, the formidable enemy, the strong,  resolute warrior, was as pale as a ghost. His jaw was fallen; his eyes  protruded; he trembled in every fibre; a cold sweat bathed his entire  body; he screamed with fear. He was not insane--he was terrified.    In groping about with his torn and bleeding hand he seized at last a  strip of board, and, pulling, felt it give way. It lay parallel with his  body, and by bending his elbow as much as the contracted space would  permit, he could draw it a few inches at a time. Finally it was  altogether loosened from the wreckage covering his legs; he could lift  it clear of the ground its whole length. A great hope came into his  mind: perhaps he could work it upward, that is to say backward, far  enough to lift the end and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],[0,"Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#9)"],[1,"death and hell,  \"Look up to me from distant lands,  \"Light, life and heaven are in my hands.    4 \"I by my holy Name have sworn,  \"Nor shall the word in vain return,  \"To me shall all things bend the knee,  \"And every tongue shall swear to me.]    5 \"In me alone shall men confess  \"Lies all their strength and righteousness;  \"But such as dare despise my Name,  \"I'll clothe them with eternal shame.    6 \"In me the Lord, shall all the seed  \"Of Israel from their sins be freed,  \"And by their shining graces prove  \"Their interest in my pardoning love.\"      Hymn 1:85.

Eccles. 9. 4 3 6 10.    1 Life is the time to serve the Lord,  The time t' insure the great reward;  And while the lamp holds out to burn  The vilest sinner may return.    2 [Life is the hour that God has given  To 'scape from hell, and fly to heaven,  The day of grace, and mortals may  Secure the blessings of the day.]    3 The living know that they must die,  But all the dead forgotten lie,  Their memory and their sense is gone,  Alike unknowing and unknown.    4 [Their hatred and their love is lost,  Their envy bury'd in the dust;  They have no share in all that's done  Beneath the circuit of the sun.]    5 Then what my thoughts design to do,  My hands, with all your might pursue,  Since no device, nor work is found,  Nor faith, nor hope beneath the ground.    6 There are no acts of pardon past  In the cold grave to which we haste,  But darkness, death, and long despair  Reign in eternal silence there.      Hymn 1:89.  Youth and judgment, Eccles. 11. 9.    1 Ye sons of Adam, vain and young,  Indulge your eyes, indulge your tongue,  Taste the delight your souls desire,  And give a loose to all your fire.    2 Pursue the pleasures ye design,  And cheer your hearts with songs and wine,  Enjoy the day of mirth; but know  There is a day of judgment too.    3 God from on high beholds your thoughts,  His book records your secret faults;  The works of darkness you have done  Must all appear before the sun.    4 The vengeance to your follies due  Should strike your hearts with terror thro':  How will ye stand before his face,  Or answer for his injur'd grace?    5 Almighty God, turn off their eyes  From these alluring vanities;  And let the thunder of thy word  Awake their souls to fear the Lord.      Hymn 1:90.  The same.    1 Lo the young tribes of Adam rise,  And thro' all nature rove,  Fulfil the wishes of their eyes,  And taste the joys they love.    2 They give a loose to wild desires,  But let the sinners know,  The strict account that God requires  Of all the works they do.    3 The Judge prepares his throne on high,  The frighted earth and seas  Avoid the fury of his eye,  And flee before his face.    4 How shall I bear that dreadful day,  And stand the fiery test?  I give all mortal joys away  To be for ever blest.      Hymn 1:91.  Advice to youth; or, Old age and death in an  unconverted state, Eccles. 12. 1 7. Isa. 65. 20.    1 Now in the heat of youthful blood  Remember your Creator God,  Behold the months come hastening on  When you shall say, \"My joys are gone.\"    2 Behold, the aged sinner goes,  Laden with guilt and heavy woes  Down to the regions of the dead,  With endless curses on his head.    3 The dust returns to dust again,  The soul in agonies of pain  Ascends to God, not there to dwell,  But hears her doom, and sinks to hell.    4 Eternal King! I fear thy Name,  Teach me to know how frail I am;  And when my soul must hence remove,  Give me a mansion in thy love.      Hymn 1:92.  Christ the wisdom of God, Prov. 8. 1 22-32.    1 Shall wisdom cry aloud  And not her speech be heard?  The voice of God's eternal word,  Deserves it no regard?    2 \"I was his chief delight,  \"His everlasting Son,  \"Before the first of all his works,  \"Creation, was begun.    3 [\"Before the flying clouds,  \"Before the solid land,  \"Before the fields, before the floods,  \"I dwelt at his right hand.    4 \"When he adorn'd the skies,  \"And built them I was there  \"To order where the sun should rise,  \"And marshal every star.    5 \"When he pour'd out the sea,  \"And spread the flowing deep,  \"I gave the flood a firm decree,  \"In its own bounds to keep.]    6 \"Upon the empty air  The earth was balanc'd well;  \"With joy I saw the mansion where  \"The sons of men should dwell.    7 \"My busy thoughts at first  \"On their salvation ran,  \"Ere sin was born, or Adam's dust  \"Was fashioned to a man.    8 \"Then come, receive my grace,  \"Ye children, and be wise;  \"Happy the man that keeps my ways;  \"The man that shuns them dies.\"      Hymn 1:93.

Justification by faith, not by works; or, The law  condemns, grace justifies, Rom. 3. 19-22.    1 Vain are the hopes the sons of men  On their own works have built;  Their hearts by nature all unclean,  And all their actions guilt.    2 Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths  Without a murmuring word,  And the whole race of Adam stand  Guilty before the Lord.    3 In vain we ask God's righteous law  To justify us now,  Since to convince and to condemn  Is all the law can do.    4 Jesus, how glorious is thy grace,  When in thy name we trust,  Our faith receives a righteousness  That makes the sinner just.      Hymn 1:95.  Regeneration, John 1. 13. and 3. 3 &c.    1 Not all the outward forms on earth,  Nor rites that God has given,  Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth,  Can raise a soul to heaven.    2 The sovereign will of God alone  Creates us heirs of grace;  Born in the image of his Son,  A new peculiar race.    3 The Spirit like some heavenly wind  Blows on the sons of flesh,  New models all the carnal mind,  And forms the man afresh.    4 Our quicken'd souls awake, and rise  From the long sleep of death;  On heavenly things we fix our eyes,  And praise employs our breath.      Hymn 1:96.  Election excludes boasting, 1 Cor. 1. 26-31.    1 But few among the carnal wise,  But few of noble race,  Obtain the favour of thine eyes,  Almighty King of Grace.    2 He takes the men of meanest name  For sons and heirs of God;  And thus he pours abundant shame  On honourable blood.    3 He calls the fool, and makes him know  The mysteries of his grace,  To bring aspiring wisdom low,  And all its pride abase.    4 Nature has all its glories lost  When brought before his throne;  No flesh shall in his presence boast  But in the Lord alone.      Hymn 1:97.  Christ our wisdom, righteousness, &c. 1 Cor. 1. 30.    1 Bury'd in shadows of the night  We lie till Christ restores the light:  Wisdom descends to heal the blind,  And chase the darkness of the mind.    2 Our guilty souls are drown'd in tears  Till his atoning blood appears,  Then we awake from deep distress,  And sing, \"The Lord our Righteousness.\"    3 Our very frame is mix'd with sin,  His Spirit makes our natures clean;  Such virtues from his sufferings flow,  At once to cleanse and pardon too.    4 Jesus beholds where Satan reigns,  Binding his slaves in heavy chains;  He sets the prisoners free, and breaks  The iron bondage from our necks.    5 Poor helpless worms in thee possess  Grace, wisdom, power, and righteousness;  Thou art our mighty All, and we  Give our whole selves, O Lord, to thee.      Hymn 1:98.  The same.    1 How heavy is the night  That"]]]
