'Yes, she has a beauty that Greece itself never excelled,' resumed  Arbaces. 'But that is not all: she has a soul worthy to match with mine.  She has a genius beyond that of woman--keen--dazzling--bold. Poetry  flows spontaneous to her lips: utter but a truth, and, however intricate  and profound, her mind seizes and commands it.  Her imagination and her  reason are not at war with each other; they harmonize and direct her  course as the winds and the waves direct some lofty bark.  With this she  unites a daring independence of thought; she can stand alone in the  world; she can be brave as she is gentle; this is the nature I have  sought all my life in woman, and never found till now.  Ione must be  mine!  In her I have a double passion; I wish to enjoy a beauty of  spirit as of form.'    'She is not yours yet, then?' said the priest.    'No; she loves me--but as a friend--she loves me with her mind only.  She fancies in me the paltry virtues which I have only the profounder  virtue to disdain.  But you must pursue with me her history. The brother  and sister were young and rich: Ione is proud and ambitious--proud of  her genius--the magic of her poetry--the charm of her conversation.  When her brother left me, and entered your temple, in order to be near  him she removed also to Pompeii.  She has suffered her talents to be  known.  She summons crowds to her feasts; her voice enchants them; her  poetry subdues.  She delights in being thought the successor of Erinna.'    'Or of Sappho?'    'But Sappho without love!  I encouraged her in this boldness of  career--in this indulgence of vanity and of pleasure.  I loved to steep  her amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city.  Mark me,  Calenus!  I desired to enervate her mind!--it has been too pure to  receive yet the breath which I wish not to pass, but burningly to eat  into, the mirror.  I wished her to be surrounded by lovers, hollow,  vain, and frivolous (lovers that her nature must despise), in order to  feel the want of love.  Then, in those soft intervals of lassitude  that succeed to excitement--I can weave my spells--excite her  interest--attract her passions--possess myself of her heart.  For it is  not the young, nor the beautiful, nor the gay, that should fascinate  Ione; her imagination must be won, and the life of Arbaces has been one  scene of triumph over the imaginations of his kind.'    'And hast thou no fear, then, of thy rivals?  The gallants of Italy are  skilled in the art to please.'    'None!  Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans, and would scorn  itself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race.'    'But thou art an Egyptian, not a Greek!'    'Egypt,' replied Arbaces, 'is the mother of Athens.  Her tutelary  Minerva is our deity; and her founder, Cecrops, was the fugitive of  Egyptian Sais. This have I already taught to her; and in my blood she  venerates the eldest dynasties of earth.  But yet I will own that of  late some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind.  She is more silent  than she used to be; she loves melancholy and subduing music; she sighs  without an outward cause.  This may be the beginning of love--it may be  the want of love.  In either case it is time for me to begin my  operations on her fancies and her heart: in the one case, to divert the  source of love to me; in the other, in me to awaken it. It is for this  that I have sought you.'    'And how can I assist you?'    'I am about to invite her to a feast in my house: I wish to dazzle--to  bewilder--to inflame her senses.  Our arts--the arts by which Egypt  trained her young novitiates--must be employed; and, under veil of the  mysteries of religion, I will open to her the secrets of love.'    'Ah! now I understand:--one of those voluptuous banquets that, despite  our dull vows of mortified coldness, we, the priests of Isis, have  shared at thy house.'    'No, no!  Thinkest thou her chaste eyes are ripe for such scenes? No;  but first we must ensnare the brother--an easier task.  Listen to me,  while I give you my instructions.'        Chapter V    MORE OF THE FLOWER-GIRL.  THE PROGRESS OF LOVE.    THE sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber in the house of Glaucus,  which I have before said is now called the 'Room of Leda'.  The morning  rays entered through rows of small casements at the higher part of the  room, and through the door which opened on the garden, that answered to  the inhabitants of the southern cities the same purpose that a  greenhouse or conservatory does to us.  The size of the garden did not  adapt it for exercise, but the various and fragrant plants with which it  was filled gave a luxury to that indolence so dear to the dwellers in a  sunny clime.  And now the odorous, fanned by a gentle wind creeping from  the adjacent sea, scattered themselves over that chamber, whose walls  vied with the richest colors of the most glowing flowers.  Besides the  gem of the room--the painting of Leda and Tyndarus--in the centre of  each compartment of the walls were set other pictures of exquisite  beauty.  In one you saw Cupid leaning on the knees of Venus; in another  Ariadne sleeping on the beach, unconscious of the perfidy of Theseus.  Merrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and the  brilliant walls--far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart of  the young Glaucus.    'I have seen her, then,' said he, as he paced that narrow chamber--'I  have heard her--nay, I have spoken to her again--I have listened to the  music of her song, and she sung of glory and of Greece.  I have  discovered the long-sought idol of my dreams; and like the Cyprian  sculptor, I have breathed life into my own imaginings.'    Longer, perhaps, had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus, but at  that moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a young  female, still half a child in years, broke upon his solitude.  She was  dressed simply in a white tunic, which reached from the neck to the  ankles; under her arm she bore a basket of flowers, and in the other  hand she held a bronze water-vase; her features were more formed than  exactly became her years, yet they were soft and feminine in their  outline, and without being beautiful in themselves, they were almost  made so by their beauty of expression; there was something ineffably  gentle, and you would say patient, in her aspect.  A look of resigned  sorrow, of tranquil endurance, had banished the smile, but not the  sweetness, from her lips; something timid and cautious in her  step--something wandering in her eyes, led you to suspect the affliction  which she had suffered from her birth--she was blind; but in the orbs  themselves there was no visible defect--their melancholy and subdued  light was clear, cloudless, and serene. 'They tell me that Glaucus is  here,' said she; 'may I come in?'    'Ah, my Nydia,' said the Greek, 'is that you I knew you would not  neglect my invitation.'    'Glaucus did but justice to himself,' answered Nydia, with a blush; 'for  he has always been kind to the poor blind girl.'    'Who could be otherwise?' said Glaucus, tenderly, and in the voice of a  compassionate brother.    Nydia sighed and paused before she resumed, without replying to his  remark. 'You have but lately returned?'    'This is the sixth sun that hath shone upon me at Pompeii.'    'And you are well?  Ah, I need not ask--for who that sees the earth,  which they tell me is so beautiful, can be ill?'    'I am well.  And you, Nydia--how you have grown!  Next year you will be  thinking what answer to make your lovers.'    A second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia, but this time she frowned  as she blushed.  'I have brought you some flowers,' said she, without  replying to a remark that she seemed to resent; and feeling about the  room till she found the table that stood by Glaucus, she laid the basket  upon it: 'they are poor, but they are fresh-gathered.'    'They might come from Flora herself,' said he, kindly; 'and I renew  again my vow to the Graces, that I will wear no other garlands while thy  hands can weave me such as these.'    'And how find you the flowers in your viridarium?--are they thriving?'    'Wonderfully so--the Lares themselves must have tended them.'    'Ah, now you give me pleasure; for I came, as often as I could steal the  leisure, to water and tend them in your absence.'    'How shall I thank thee, fair Nydia?' said the Greek.  'Glaucus little  dreamed that he left one memory so watchful over his favorites at  Pompeii.'    The hand of the child trembled, and her breast heaved beneath her tunic.  She turned round in embarrassment.  'The sun is hot for the poor  flowers,' said she, 'to-day and they will miss me; for I have been ill  lately, and it is nine days since I visited them.'    'Ill, Nydia!--yet your cheek has more color than it had last year.'    'I am often ailing,' said the blind girl, touchingly; 'and as I grow up  I grieve more that I am blind.  But now to the flowers!' So saying, she  made a slight reverence with her head, and passing into the viridarium,  busied herself with watering the flowers.    'Poor Nydia,' thought Glaucus, gazing on her; 'thine is a hard doom!  Thou seest not the earth--nor the sun--nor the ocean--nor the  stars--above all, thou canst not behold Ione.'    At that last thought his mind flew back to the past evening, and was a  second time disturbed in its reveries by the entrance of Clodius.  It  was a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and to  refine the love of the Athenian for Ione, that whereas he had confided  to Clodius the secret of his first interview with her, and the effect it  had produced on him, he now felt an invincible aversion even to mention  to him her name.  He had seen Ione, bright, pure, unsullied, in the  midst of the gayest and most profligate gallants of Pompeii, charming  rather"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#9)"],[1," He heard the story of the castle and its sleeping beauty.    He knew what danger lay in the great hedge of thorn bushes.    But the young prince was brave, and he was not to be turned back.    \"I am not afraid. I will go out and see this beautiful Briar Rose,\" he  said.    It happened that the hundred years of the magic spell had just ended.    The day had come when the sleeping princess was to wake up again.    As the prince came to the hedge of thorn bushes, it was in full bloom  and covered with beautiful red flowers. There, through the thorn bushes,  lay a wide road.    Soon the prince came to the gates of the castle.    He found the horses and dogs lying asleep on the ground.    The doves sat on the roof with their heads under their wings.    He went into the castle.    Even the flies on the wall still slept.    Near the throne lay the king and queen, while all around were the  sleeping lords and ladies.    [Illustration]    The whole castle was so still that he could hear his heart beat.    The prince went on from room to room until he came to the old tower.    Going up the winding stair he saw the little door.    A rusty key was in the lock, and the door was half open.    There before him lay the sleeping princess.    The prince bent down and gave her a kiss.    As he did so the sleeping beauty opened her eyes. With her the whole  castle awoke.    The king waked up, and the queen, and all the lords and ladies.    The horses in the stable stood up and shook themselves.    The dogs jumped about and wagged their tails.    The doves on the roof lifted their heads and flew into the fields.    The flies on the wall began to buzz.    The fire in the kitchen began to burn.    The meat began to roast.    The cook boxed the ears of the kitchen boy, so that he ran off crying.    The hedge of thorn bushes around the castle dried up and blew away.    Then the prince married the beautiful princess, and they lived happily  ever after.    WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM              ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL        All things bright and beautiful,        All creatures great and small,      All things wise and wonderful,        The Lord God made them all.        Each little flower that opens,        Each little bird that sings,      He made their glowing colors,        He made their tiny wings.        The cold wind in the winter,        The pleasant summer sun,      The ripe fruits in the garden,        He made them every one.        He gave us eyes to see them,        And lips that we might tell      How great is God Almighty,        Who hath made all things well.        MRS. C.F. ALEXANDER          [Illustration]    THE BAKER BOYS AND THE BEES--I    trouble  Andernach  guarded      Long years ago many cities had great stone walls around them.    The walls were built to keep out enemies, for in those old days cities  often went to war with one another.    The city of Andernach had around it one of these great walls.    There was only one gateway into the city, and this gateway was guarded  by strong iron doors.    Just behind the doors lived a gatekeeper, who did nothing but open and  shut the gates.    He watched them well.    No one could come in who was not friendly to the city.    The gates were not opened very often. Some days they were not opened at  all. So the gatekeeper had much spare time.    \"I am very fond of honey,\" thought he. \"I think I will buy a few hives  of bees. I can place the hives on the top of the wall. There nobody will  trouble them.\"    Soon there were rows of beehives on the top of the wall over the gate.    It happened that, not far away, there was another walled city, named  Lintz.    The people of Lintz were the enemies of the people of Andernach.    They were always watching each other, and fought when they could get a  chance.    Now the people of Lintz planned to attack and capture the city of  Andernach.    They called their wisest men together to see how the attack should be  made.    Many plans were talked over.    At length an old man said, \"Men of Lintz, you know that the men of  Andernach are lazy. They like to lie late in their beds. If we attack  the city at sunrise, we shall capture it before they can get their eyes  open.\"    This plan seemed wise to the people of Lintz, and in army was soon ready  to march against the city of Andernach.    One dark night the army crept softly toward the walls of the sleeping  city.      THE BAKER BOYS AND THE BEES--II    The only people who rose early in Andernach were the bakers. They had to  have fresh bread ready for breakfast.    After their work was done the bakers used to have a morning nap, but the  baker boys had to stay awake and watch the loaves of bread.    Two of these boys, named Hans and Fritz, were fast friends and were  always together.    One morning, just at sunrise, Hans said to Fritz, \"Let us creep upon the  wall over the gatekeeper's house. I think we can find some honey. The  old gatekeeper is asleep; he will not hear us.\"    The two boys crept softly up the stairs.    They soon reached the top of the wall.    \"Did you hear that noise?\" whispered Fritz.    \"Yes, it must be the old gatekeeper,\" said Hans, in a low voice.    \"No, it seems to come from over the wall,\" said Fritz.    The two boys crawled to the edge of the wall and carefully looked over.    There stood the army of Lintz.    A ladder was placed against the wall.    The soldiers would soon mount over the gate into the city.    What was to be done?    There was no time to wake the people.    What could two boys do against an army?    In an instant Fritz thought of the beehives.    Ah, the bees were awake if the people were not!    Each boy seized a hive and bore it carefully to the edge of the wall.    Then with a strong push down tumbled hives, honey, and bees upon the  heads of the enemy.    Such buzzing, such stinging, such shouting as arose!    The boys ran down the stairs to the city hall.    [Illustration]    The old bell ringer was aroused by the cries.    Soon the wild clang of the bell awoke the people of Andernach.    Armed men ran to the city gate, but the bees had done their work well.  There was no need for soldiers.    The army of Lintz was running away.    Over the great gate the people of Andernach placed a statue of the two  baker boys whose quick wit had saved the city.    _German Folk Tale_              FALLING SNOW        See the pretty snowflakes        Falling from the sky;      On the wall and housetops        Soft and thick they lie.        On the window ledges,        On the branches bare;      Now how fast they gather,        Filling all the air.        Look into the garden,        Where the grass was green;      Covered by the snowflakes,        Not a blade is seen.        Now the bare black bushes        All look soft and white,      Every twig is laden,--        What a pretty sight!        ANONYMOUS          LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES      All the world must know that Two Shoes was not her real name. No; her  father's name was Meanwell, and he was for many years a well-to-do  farmer.    While Margery (for that was her real name) was yet a little girl her  father became very poor. He was so poor that at last he and Margery's  mother and Margery and her little brother were all turned out of doors.  They did not have a roof to cover their heads.    Margery's father felt so unhappy that at last he died, and only a few  days later Margery's mother died, too. Poor little Margery and her  brother were left alone in the wide world.    Their sorrow would have made you pity them, but it would have done your  heart good to see how fond they were of each other. They always went  about hand in hand, and when you saw one you were sure to see the other.    [Illustration]    Look at them in the picture.    They were both very ragged, and though Tommy had two shoes, Margery had  but one. They had nothing, poor little things, to live upon but what  kind people gave to them. Each night they lay on the hay in just such a  barn as you see here.    [Illustration]      LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--II    Mr. Smith was a very good man who lived in the town where little Margery  and Tommy were born. Although he was a poor man, he took the children  home to live with him.    \"They shall not want for food nor for a bed to sleep in while I live,\"  he said.    Mr. Smith had a friend who was a very wealthy man. When he heard the  story about Margery and Tommy, this man gave Mr. Smith some money to buy  little Margery a new pair of shoes and Tommy a new suit of clothes. Can  you see Tommy in the picture wearing his new clothes?    [Illustration]    The gentleman who had given the money for Margery's new shoes and  Tommy's new clothes wished to take Tommy with him to London to make a  sailor of him.    When the time came for Tommy to go, both children began to cry. They  kissed each other a hundred times. At last Tommy wiped away Margery's  tears and said:    \"Don't cry, little sister, for I will come home to you again and bring  you beautiful clothes and much money.\"    That night Margery went to bed weeping for her dear little brother. It  was the first time they had ever been parted.    The next morning the shoemaker came in with Margery's new shoes. She put  them on in great glee and ran out to Mrs. Smith crying, \"Two shoes, two  shoes. See goody two shoes!\" This she did to all the people she met, so  that soon she was known far and wide as Goody Two Shoes.      LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--III    Dear little Margery saw how good and wise Mr. Smith was. She thought it  was because he read so many books.    Soon Margery wished, above all things, to learn to read. She would  borrow books from the school children and sit down and read and read.  Very soon she could read better than any of her playmates.    Margery took such delight in her books that she wished everybody else  could read, too, so she formed this plan of teaching very little  children how to read.    First, she made"]]]
