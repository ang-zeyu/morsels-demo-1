But I would very much like to know why you come         to me to borrow so often.    [Illustration: Two girls seated, talking.]    Mary.  Because you never lose any of your things,         and always know where to find them.    Sarah. And why do I always know where to find my things?    Mary.  I do not know why, I am sure. If I did         know, I might sometimes find my own.    Sarah. I will tell you the secret. I have a place for         everything, and I put everything in its place when I         have done using it.    Mary.  O Sarah! who wants to run and put away a         thing as soon as she has used it, as if her life         depended upon it?    Sarah. Our life does not depend upon it, but our         comfort does, surely. How much more time will it         take to put a thing in its place, than to hunt for it or         to borrow whenever you want to use it ?    Mary.  Well, Sarah, I will never borrow of you         again, you may depend upon it.    Sarah. You are not offended with me, I hope.    Mary.  No, but I am ashamed. Before night, I will         have a place for everything, and then I will keep         everything in its place. You have taught me a lesson         that I shall remember.

George Ellet had a bright silver dollar for a New-year gift.    2. He thought of all the fine things he might buy with it.    3. The ground was all covered with snow; but the sun shone out bright, and  everything looked beautiful.    4. So George put on his hat, and ran into the street. As he went skipping  along, he met some boys throwing snowballs. George soon engaged in the  sport.    5. He sent a ball at James Mason, but it missed him, and broke a window on  the other side of the street.    6. George feared some one would come out of the house and find him. So he  ran off as fast as he could.    [Illustration: Boy throwing snowball through window.]    7. As soon as he got round the next corner, George stopped, because he was  very sorry for what he had done.    8. He said to himself, \"I have no right to spend my silver dollar, now. I  ought to go back, and pay for the glass I broke with my snowball.\"    9. He went up and down the street, and felt very sad. He wished very much  to buy something nice. He also wished to pay for the broken glass.    10. At last he said, \"It was wrong to break the window, though I did not  mean to do it. I will go and pay for it, if it takes all my money, I will  try not to be sorry. I do not think the man will hurt me if I pay for the  mischief I have done.\"        LESSON LXI.    mer'chant    hon'est ly    rang    mind    part'ner     with out'     rich    bell      THE BROKEN WINDOW.  (CONCLUDED.)    1. George started off, and felt much happier for having made up his mind  to do what was right.    2. He rang the doorbell. When the man came out, George said, \"Sir, I threw  a snowball through your window. But I did not intend to do it. I am very  sorry, and wish to pay you. Here is the dollar my father gave me as a New-  year gift.\"    3. The gentleman took the dollar, and asked George if he had no more  money. George said he had not. \"Well,\" said he, \"this will do.\"    [Illustration: George paying for broken window.]    4. So, after asking George his name, and where he lived, he called him an  honest boy, and shut the door.    5. George went home at dinner time, with a face as rosy, and eyes as  bright, as if nothing had gone wrong. At dinner, Mr. Ellet asked him what  he had bought with his money.    6. George very honestly told him all about the broken window, and said he  felt very well without any money to spend.    7. When dinner was over, Mr. Ellet told George to go and look in his cap.  He did so, and found two silver dollars there.    8. The man, whose window had been broken, had been there, and told Mr.  Ellet about it. He gave back George's dollar and another besides.    9. A short time after this, the man came and told Mr. Ellet that he wanted  a good boy to stay in his store.    10. As soon as George left school, he went to live with this man, who was  a rich merchant. In a few years he became the merchant's partner.

Hour-glass and flowers on  table between them.]      FRANK AND THE HOURGLASS.    1. Frank was a very talkative little boy. He never saw a new thing without  asking a great many questions about it.    2. His mother was very patient and kind. When it was proper to answer his  questions, she would do so.    3. Sometimes she would say, \"You are not old enough to understand that, my  son. When you are ten years old, you may ask me about it, and I will tell  you.\"    4. When his mother said this, he never teased any more. He knew she always  liked to answer him when he asked proper questions.    5. The first time Frank saw an hourglass, he was very much amused; but he  did not know what it was.    6. His mother said, \"An hourglass is made in the shape of the figure 8.  The sand is put in at one end, and runs through a small hole in the  middle. As much sand is put into the glass as will run through in an  hour.\"    7. Frank watched the little stream of sand. He was impatient, because it  would not run faster. \"Let me shake it, mother,\" said he; \"it is lazy, and  will never get through.\"    8. \"Oh yes, it will, my son,\" said his mother, \"The sand moves by little  and little, but it moves all the time. 9. \"When you look at the hands of  the clock, you think they go very slowly, and so they do; but they never  stop.    10, \"While you are at play the sand is running, grain by grain, The hands  of the clock are moving, second by second.    11. \"At night, the sand in the hourglass has run through twelve times. The  hour hand of the clock has moved all around its great face.    12. \"This because they keep work every minute. They do not stop to think  how much they have to do, and how long it will take them to do it.\"    13. Now, Frank's mother wanted him to learn a little hymn; but he said  \"Mother, I can never learn it.\"    14. His mother said, \"Study all the time. Never stop to ask how long it  will take to learn it. You will be able to say it very soon.\"    15. Frank followed his mother's advice. He studied line after line, very  busily; and in one hour and a half he knew the hymn perfectly.

In the snowing and the blowing,       In the cruel sleet,     Little flowers begin their growing       Far beneath our feet.    2. Softly taps the Spring, and cheerly,--       \"Darlings, are you here?\"     Till they answer, \"We are nearly,       Nearly ready, dear.\"    3. \"Where is Winter, with his snowing?       Tell us, Spring,\" they say.     Then she answers, \"He is going,       Going on his way.    4. \"Poor old Winter does not love you;       But his time is past;     Soon my birds shall sing above you;--       Set you free at last.\"                                  Mary Mapes Dodge.

She won't be caught.\"    [Illustration: Man and boy chasing horse.]    2. Such was the report the hired man brought in to Mrs. Templar one  pleasant May morning, when she had been planning a ride.    3. \"I suppose it can not be helped, but I wanted her very much,\" she said,  as she turned away.    4. \"What was it you wanted, mother?\" asked Jenny Templar, a bright,  brown-haired, brown-eyed girl of twelve, who had just come into the room.    5. \"Fanny,\" said the mother. \"It is such a beautiful morning, I meant to  drive down to the village, get some groceries, then call for your Aunt  Ann, have a nice ride up the river road, and bring her home to dinner.    6. \"But father is away for all day, and the men have been trying nearly an  hour to catch Fanny; one of the men says she can't be caught.\"    7. \"Maybe she can't by him,\" said Jenny, with a merry laugh. \"But, get  ready, mother; you shall go if you like. I'll catch Fanny, and harness  her, too.\"    8. \"Why, my child, they say she jumped the ditch three or four times, and  acted like a wild creature. You'll only be late at school, and tire  yourself for nothing.\"    9. \"It won't take me long, mother. Fanny will come to me,\" said Jenny,  cheerily.

The name means \"beautiful\" or \"pleasant,\"  and _Cassi_ appears in personal and tribal names, and also in  _Cassiterides_, an early name of Britain, perhaps signifying that the  new lands were \"more beautiful\" than those the Celts had left. When tin  was discovered in Britain, the Mediterranean traders called it [Greek:  chassiteros], after the name of the place where it was found, as  _cupreus_, \"copper,\" was so called from Cyprus.[117]    Many local tutelar divinities were also worshipped. When a new  settlement was founded, it was placed under the protection of a tribal  god, or the name of some divinised river on whose banks the village was  placed, passed to the village itself, and the divinity became its  protector. Thus Dea Bibracte, Nemausus, and Vasio were tutelar  divinities of Bibracte, Nimes, and Vaison. Other places were called  after Belenos, or a group of divinities, usually the _Matres_ with a  local epithet, watched over a certain district.[118] The founding of a  town was celebrated in an annual festival, with sacrifices and libations  to the protecting deity, a practice combated by S. Eloi in the eighth  century. But the custom of associating a divinity with a town or region  was a great help to patriotism. Those who fought for their homes felt  that they were fighting for their gods, who also fought on their side.  Several inscriptions, \"To the genius of the place,\" occur in Britain,  and there are a few traces of tutelar gods in Irish texts, but generally  local saints had taken their place.    The Celtic cult of goddesses took two forms, that of individual and that  of grouped goddesses, the latter much more numerous than the grouped  gods. Individual goddesses were worshipped as consorts of gods, or as  separate personalities, and in the latter case the cult was sometimes  far extended. Still more popular was the cult of grouped goddesses. Of  these the _Matres_, like some individual goddesses, were probably early  Earth-mothers, and since the primitive fertility-cults included all that  might then be summed up as \"civilisation,\" such goddesses had already  many functions, and might the more readily become divinities of special  crafts or even of war. Many individual goddesses are known only by their  names, and were of a purely local character.[119] Some local goddesses  with different names but similar functions are equated with the same  Roman goddess; others were never so equated.    The Celtic Minerva, or the goddesses equated with her, \"taught the  elements of industry and the arts,\"[120] and is thus the equivalent of  the Irish Brigit. Her functions are in keeping with the position of  woman as the first civiliser--discovering agriculture, spinning, the art  of pottery, etc. During this period goddesses were chiefly worshipped,  and though the Celts had long outgrown this primitive stage, such  culture-goddesses still retained their importance. A goddess equated  with Minerva in Southern France and Britain is Belisama, perhaps from  _qval_, \"to burn\" or \"shine.\"[121] Hence she may have been associated  with a cult of fire, like Brigit and like another goddess Sul, equated  with Minerva at Bath and in Hesse, and in whose temple perpetual fires  burned.[122] She was also a goddess of hot springs. Belisama gave her  name to the Mersey,[123] and many goddesses in Celtic myth are  associated with rivers.    Some war-goddesses are associated with Mars--Nemetona (in Britain and  Germany), perhaps the same as the Irish Nemon, and Cathubodua, identical  with the Irish war-goddess Badb-catha, \"battle-crow,\" who tore the  bodies of the slain.[124] Another goddess Andrasta, \"invincible,\"  perhaps the same as the Andarta of the Voconces, was worshipped by the  people of Boudicca with human sacrifices, like the native Bellona of the  Scordisci.[125]    A goddess of the chase was identified with Artemis in Galatia, where she  had a priestess Camma, and also in the west. At the feast of the  Galatian goddess dogs were crowned with flowers, her worshippers feasted  and a sacrifice was made to her, feast and sacrifice being provided out  of money laid aside for every animal taken in the chase.[126] Other  goddesses were equated with Diana, and one of her statues was destroyed  in Christian times at Treves.[127] These goddesses may have been thought  of as rushing through the forest with an attendant train, since in later  times Diana, with whom they were completely assimilated, became, like  Holda, the leader of the \"furious host\" and also of witches'  revels.[128] The Life of Caesarius of Arles speaks of a \"demon\" called  Diana by the rustics. A bronze statuette represents the goddess riding a  wild boar,[129] her symbol and, like herself, a creature of the forest,  but at an earlier time itself a divinity of whom the goddess became the  anthropomorphic form.    Goddesses, the earlier spirits of the waters, protected rivers and  springs, or were associated with gods of healing wells. Dirona or Sirona  is associated with Grannos mainly in Eastern Gaul and the Rhine  provinces, and is sometimes represented carrying grapes and grain.[130]  Thus this goddess may once have been connected with fertility, perhaps  an Earth-mother, and if her name means \"the long-lived,\"[131] this would  be an appropriate title for an Earth-goddess. Another goddess, Stanna,  mentioned in an inscription at Perigueux, is perhaps \"the standing or  abiding one,\" and thus may also have been Earth-goddess.[132] Grannos  was also associated with the local goddesses Vesunna and Aventia, who  gave their names to Vesona and Avanche. His statue also stood in the  temple of the goddess of the Seine, Sequana.[133] With Bormo were  associated Bormana in Southern Gaul, and Damona in Eastern Gaul--perhaps  an animal goddess, since the root of her name occurs in Irish _dam_,  \"ox,\" and Welsh _dafad_, \"sheep.\" Dea Brixia was the consort of  Luxovius, god of the waters of Luxeuil. Names of other goddesses of the  waters are found on _ex votos_ and plaques which were placed in or near  them. The Roman Nymphae, sometimes associated with Bormo, were the  equivalents of the Celtic water-goddesses, who survived in the  water-fairies of later folk-belief. Some river-goddesses gave their  names to many rivers in the Celtic area--the numerous Avons being named  from Abnoba, goddess of the sources of the Danube, and the many Dees and  Dives from Divona. Clota was goddess of the Clyde, Sabrina had her  throne \"beneath the translucent wave\" of the Severn, Icauna was goddess  of the Yonne, Sequana of the Seine, and Sinnan of the Shannon.    In some cases forests were ruled by goddesses--that of the Ardennes by  Dea Arduinna, and the Black Forest, perhaps because of the many waters  in it, by Dea Abnoba.[134] While some goddesses are known only by being  associated with a god, e.g. Kosmerta with Mercury in Eastern Gaul,  others have remained separate, like Epona, perhaps a river-goddess  merged with an animal divinity, and known from inscriptions as a  horse-goddess.[135] But the most striking instance is found in the  grouped goddesses.    Of these the _Deoe Matres_, whose name has taken a Latin form and whose  cult extended to the Teutons, are mentioned in many inscriptions all  over the Celtic area, save in East and North-West Gaul.[136] In art they  are usually represented as three in number, holding fruit, flowers, a  cornucopia, or an infant. They were thus goddesses of fertility, and  probably derived from a cult of a great Mother-goddess, the Earth  personified. She may have survived as a goddess Berecynthia; worshipped  at Autun, where her image was borne through the fields to promote  fertility, or as the goddesses equated with Demeter and Kore, worshipped  by women on an island near Britain.[137] Such cults of a Mother-goddess  lie behind many religions, but gradually her place was taken by an  Earth-god, the Celtic Dispater or Dagda, whose consort the goddess  became. She may therefore be the goddess with the cornucopia on  monuments of the horned god, or Aeracura, consort of Dispater, or a  goddess on a monument at Epinal holding a basket of fruit and a  cornucopia, and accompanied by a ram's-headed serpent.[138] These  symbols show that this goddess was akin to the _Matres_. But she  sometimes preserved her individuality, as in the case of Berecynthia and  the _Matres_, though it is not quite clear why she should have been thus  triply multiplied. A similar phenomenon is found in the close connection  of Demeter and Persephone, while the Celts regarded three as a sacred  number. The primitive division of the year into three seasons--spring,  summer, and winter--may have had its effect in triplicating a goddess of  fertility with which the course of the seasons was connected.[139] In  other mythologies groups of three goddesses are found, the Hathors in  Egypt, the Moirai, Gorgons, and Graiae of Greece, the Roman Fates, and  the Norse Nornae, and it is noticeable that the _Matres_ were sometimes  equated with the Parcae and Fates.[140]    In the _Matres_, primarily goddesses of fertility and plenty, we have  one of the most popular and also primitive aspects of Celtic religion.  They originated in an age when women cultivated the ground, and the  Earth was a goddess whose cult was performed by priestesses. But in  course of time new functions were bestowed on the _Matres_. Possibly  river-goddesses and others are merely mothers whose functions have  become specialised. The _Matres_ are found as guardians of individuals,  families, houses, of towns, a province, or a whole nation, as their  epithets in inscriptions show. The _Matres Domesticae_ are household  goddesses; the _Matres Treverae_, or _Gallaicae_, or _Vediantae_, are the  mothers of Treves, of the Gallaecae, of the Vediantii; the _Matres  Nemetiales_ are guardians of groves.
