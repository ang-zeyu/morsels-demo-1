When the  bow is to be used the upper part of the dress was thrown off from the  shoulders and arms, and a broad fold, the whole extent of it, was  secured round the loins, with a belt to keep the lower part from the  ground and the whole from falling off, when the arms were at liberty.  The collar of the dress was sometimes made of alternate stripes of  otter and deer skins sewed together, and sufficiently broad to cover  the head and face when turned up, and this is made to answer the  purpose of a hood of a cloak in bad weather--occasionally leggings or  gaiters were worn, and arm coverings, all made of deer skins--their  moccasins were also made of the same material; in summer, however,  they frequently went without any covering for the feet.      BOEOTHICK ARMS.    These, whether offensive or defensive, or for killing game, were  simply the bow and arrow, spear, and club. The arrow-heads were of two  kinds, viz.:--stone, bone or iron, the latter material being derived  from Europeans, and the blunt arrow, the point being a knob  continuous with the shaft--the former of these was used for killing  quadrupeds and large birds, the latter for killing small birds--two  strips of goose feathers were tied on to balance the arrow, and it has  been remarked by many persons who have seen the Red Indians' arrows,  that they have invariably been a yard long; the reason of this would  seem to be that their measure for the arrow was the arm's length, that  is, from the centre of the chest to the tip of the middle finger, that  being the proper length to draw the bow--the latter was about five  feet long, generally made of mountain ash, but sometimes of spruce.    Their spears were of two kinds--the one, their chief weapon, was  twelve feet in length, pointed with bone or iron, whenever the latter  material could be obtained, and was used in killing deer and other  animals. The other was fourteen feet in length and was used chiefly,  if not wholly, in killing seals--the head or point being easily  separated from the shaft--the service of the latter being, indeed  mainly, to guide the point into the body of the animal, and which  being effected, the shaft was withdrawn, and a strong strip of deer  skin, which was always kept fastened to the spear head, was held by  the Indian, and who in this manner secured his prey.      CANOES.    These varied from sixteen to twenty-two feet in length, with an upward  curve towards each end. Laths were introduced from stem to stern  instead of planks--they were provided with a gunwhale or edging which,  though slight, added strength to the fabric--the whole was covered on  the outside with deer skins sewed together and fastened by stitching  the edges round the gunwhale.      LANGUAGE.    The language of the Boeothicks, Mr. Cormack is of opinion, is  different from all the languages of the neighbouring tribes of Indians  with which any comparison has been made. Of all the words procured at  different times from the female Indian Shaw-na-dith-it, and which were  compared with the Micmac and Banake (the latter people bordering on  the Mohawk) not one was found similar to the language of the latter  people, and only two words which could be supposed to have had the  same origin, viz.: Keuis--Boeothick--and \"Kuse\" Banake--both words  meaning \"Sun,\"--and moosin Boeothick, and moccasin, Banake and Micmac.  The Boeothick also differs from the Mountaineer or Esquimaux language  of Labrador. The Micmac, Mountaineer, and Banake, have no \"_r_.\" The  Boeothick has; the three first use \"_l_\" instead of \"_r_.\" The  Boeothick has the dipthong _sh_.--the other languages, as before  enumerated, have it not. The Boeothicks have no characters to serve as  hieroglyphics or letters, but they had a few symbols or signatures.      METHOD OF INTERMENT.    The Boeothicks appear to have shown great respect for their dead, and  the most remarkable remains of them commonly observed by Europeans at  the sea coasts are their burial places. They had several modes of  interment--one was when the body of the deceased had been wrapped in  birch rind, it was then, with his property, placed on a sort of  scaffold about four feet from the ground--the scaffold supported a  flooring of small squared beams laid close together, on which the body  and property rested.    A second method was, when the body bent together and wrapped in birch  rinds was enclosed in a sort of box on the ground--this box was made  of small square posts laid on each other horizontally, and notched at  the corners to make them meet close--it was about four feet high,  three feet broad, and two-feet-and-a-half deep, well lined with birch  rind, so as to exclude the weather from the inside--the body was  always laid on its right side.    A third, and the most common method of burying among this people, was  to wrap the body in birch rind, and then cover it over with a heap of  stones on the surface of the earth; but occasionally in sandy places,  or where the earth was soft and easily removed, the body was sunk  lower in the earth and the stones omitted.      Their marriage ceremony consisted merely in a prolonged feast, and  which rarely terminated before the end of twenty-four hours. Polygamy  would seem not to have been countenanced by the tribe.    Of their remedies for disease, the following were those the most  frequently resorted to:--    For pains in the stomach, a decoction of the rind of the dogberry was  drank.    For sickness among old people--sickness in the stomach, pains in the  back, and for rheumatism, the vapor-bath was used.    For sore head, neck, &c., pounded sulphuret of iron mixed up with oil  was rubbed over the part affected, and was said generally to effect a  cure in two or three days.      Brief as the foregoing statement is, yet, so scanty are the materials  which relate to the subject, that it contains substantially all the  facts which can now be gathered together of that interesting people,  the original inhabitants of Newfoundland--a people whose origin and  fate are alike shrouded in mystery, and of whom, in their passage  across the stage of life, but little is certainly known, beyond the  cruel outrages, the bitter wrongs they endured at the hands of the  white man--before whose power, so mercilessly used, the tribe sank,  and was either utterly annihilated, or, as is more probable, a  remnant--worn out, harrassed beyond human endurance--left the homes of  their fathers, and in another land sought that security for their  lives which was denied them in this.

PERSONAL PRONOUNS (_contd._).      Pronouns in the Disjunctive form occupy the same position in the  sentence as they do in English.    Pronouns in the Conjunctive form precede the verb, as--    El los compro: He bought them.    Yo le mostrare a V. mi libro mayor y mi diario: I shall show you my  ledger and journal or day-book.    Mi cajero les pagara lo que les debo: My cashier will pay you what I owe  you.    Nos ha exhibido su libro de facturas: He showed us his invoice book.    Me cedio los valores y efectos en cartera: He made over to me his stock  of securities and bills.    El corredor le vio en la agencia de los vapores: The broker saw him at  the steamship agent's.      EXCEPTIONS--    1. When a sentence begins with a verb, especially if the sentence is a  long one, the Conjunctive pronoun _may_ follow the verb, _except when  this is in the Subjunctive Mood_, as--    Bonificole esta cantidad en cuenta corriente para no perder el cliente:  He credited him the amount in A/c current in order not to lose his  customer.    N.B.--Students should not indulge in this liberty until they have  acquired practice in the language. In conversation this change seldom  occurs. When the change is used the Subject Pronoun is generally left  understood.    2. When the verb is in the Infinitive Mood, Gerund, or Imperative  Mood,[78] the Conjunctive Pronoun _must_ follow, and is joined to the  verb to form one word: as--      Lo mejor con estos generos es venderlos en subasta:  The best thing with these goods is to sell them by auction.    Abandonandole la ganancia acabaremos con el asunto:  By giving up the profit to him, we shall end the matter.    Refieralos V. a los armadores: Refer them to the shipowners.    Hagannos Vs. esta bonificacion: Make us this allowance.    Carguenos en cuenta este renglon: Debit this line to our account.    Abonenle la suma que reclama: Credit him with the amount he claims.    [Footnote 78: By Imperative Mood, we mean Imperative Mood Affirmative.  In Spanish there is no imperative mood negative, its place being taken by  the Present Subjunctive, as--         Hablale tu: Speak to him.       No le hables tu: Do not speak to him.]      If two Conjunctive pronouns meet, contrary to the English general rule,  the pronoun which stands as indirect object precedes the pronoun  standing as direct object,[79] as--    Ellos nos lo garantizan: They guarantee it to us.    If these two pronouns are both in the 3rd person, the indirect object is  changed into =Se=, as--    Nosotros se lo vendimos: We sold it to him.  V. se lo mando (a ella)[80]: You sent it to her.  Nosotros se lo aconsejamos (a ellos)[80]: We gave them that advice.  Yo se lo digo (a V.)[80]: I tell it to you.    [Footnote 79: Combinations of _me_ and _te_ are _very rare_, and then _te_  precedes whether direct or indirect object, the context clearly showing  the meaning. In such cases it is better, however, to use a disjunctive  form, for the indirect object, as--         El te da a mi: He gives thee to me.       El me da a ti: He gives me to thee.]    [Footnote 80: _A el, a ella, a V._, etc., may be added for clearness, when  otherwise ambiguity might occur.]           VOCABULARY.    =administrador=, manager (of a branch house, etc.)  =arancel=, custom-house tariff  =aviso=, advice, notice  =confianza=, trust, confidence  =constantemente=, constantly  =conveniente=, convenient, suitable  =correo=, post, post office  =*dar aviso=, to inform, to give notice to leave  =*dar aviso de despedida=, to give notice of dismissal  =de moda=, fashionable  =devolver=, to give or send back  =efectuar=, to effect  =favorable=, favourable  =fijar=, to fix  =holgazan, haragan=, lazy  =honrar=, to honour  =indicar=, to indicate, to point out  =largo=, long  =noticia, noticias=, news  =*poner en condiciones=, to enable  =por=, _or_ =de, su cuenta=, on his account  =el sobre=, the envelope  =tomar nota=, to take note, to notice  =venta=, sale                                  EXERCISE 1 (17).

REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS.      These pronouns are not, of course, used as subject of the verb. They are  used as the object of the verb when this and the subject are the same.    They are the same as the other personal pronouns, as--                   Conjunctive form.   Disjunctive form.        myself             me                mi      thyself            te                ti    EXCEPTION--  3rd person for both genders & numbers:                         se                si      EXAMPLES--    El se ama: He loves himself.    Ella se atribuye la culpa: She attributes the fault to herself.    Maria habla siempre de si[82]: Mary is always talking about herself.    Nosotros nos divertimos al mismo tiempo que hacemos negocios: We enjoy  ourselves at the same time as we do business.    Ellos se respetan a si y a otros tambien: They respect themselves and  others too.    _Mismo-a,-os,-as_, may be added to the disjunctive form for emphasis,  as--    Maria habla siempre de si misma: Mary always speaks of herself.    Ella se atribuye la culpa: She attributes the fault to herself.    Ella se atribuye la culpa a si: She attributes the fault to herself.  (more emphatic).    Ella se atribuye la culpa a si misma: She attributes the fault to  herself (still more emphatic).    [Footnote 82: After _con_ (with) _si_ becomes Sigo; same change with  _mi_ and _ti_: conmigo, contigo, consigo, written in one word.]      The pronoun =Se= with any verb in the 3rd pers. sing. or plural may be  used to form the passive voice, as--    Se ha cerrado el almacen: The warehouse has been closed.    Se han encaminado las reclamaciones a la Compania de Seguros[83]:  The claims have been referred to the Insurance Company.    [ootnote 83: This form is preferable when the \"do"]]]
