EVELYN (1620-1706), the  diarist, after inspecting his chemical laboratory, rather harshly speaks  of him as \"an errant mountebank\". Elsewhere he well refers to him as \"a  teller of strange things\"--this was on the occasion of DIGBY'S relating  a story of a lady who had such an aversion to roses that one laid on her  cheek produced a blister!    (1) _A late Discourse... by Sir_ KENELM DIGBY, _Kt.&c. Touching the Cure  of Wounds by the Powder of Sympathy...rendered... out of French into  English by_ R. WHITE, Gent. (1658). This is entitled the second edition,  but appears to have been the first.      To return to the _Late Discourse_: after some preliminary remarks, Sir  KENELM records a cure which he claims to have effected by means of  the Powder. It appears that JAMES HOWELL (1594-1666, afterwards  historiographer royal to CHARLES II.), had, in the attempt to separate  two friends engaged in a duel, received two serious wounds in the hand.  To proceed in the writer's own words:--\"It was my chance to be lodged  hard by him; and four or five days after, as I was making myself ready,  he (Mr Howell) came to my House, and prayed me to view his wounds; for  I understand, said he, that you have extraordinary remedies upon such  occasions, and my Surgeons apprehend some fear, that it may grow to a  Gangrene, and so the hand must be cut off....    \"I asked him then for any thing that had the blood upon it, so he  presently sent for his Garter, wherewith his hand was first bound: and  having called for a Bason of water, as if I would wash my hands; I took  an handfull of Powder of Vitrol, which I had in my study, and presently  dissolved it. As soon as the bloody garter was brought me, I put it  within the Bason, observing in the interim what Mr _Howel_ did,  who stood talking with a Gentleman in the corner of my Chamber, not  regarding at all what I was doing: but he started suddenly, as if he had  found some strange alteration in himself; I asked him what he ailed? I  know not what ailes me, but I find that I feel no more pain, methinks  that a pleasing kind of freshnesse, as it were a wet cold Napkin  did spread over my hand, which hath taken away the inflammation that  tormented me before; I replied, since that you feel already so good an  effect of my medicament, I advise you to cast away all your Plaisters,  onely keep the wound clean, and in a moderate temper 'twixt heat and  cold. This was presently reported to the Duke of _Buckingham_, and a  little after to the King (James I.), who were both very curious to know  the issue of the businesse, which was, that after dinner I took the  garter out of the water, and put it to dry before a great fire; it was  scarce dry, but Mr _Howels_ servant came running (and told me), that his  Master felt as much burning as ever he had done, if not more, for the  heat was such, as if his hand were betwixt coales of fire: I answered,  that although that had happened at present, yet he should find ease in  a short time; for I knew the reason of this new accident, and I  would provide accordingly, for his Master should be free from that  inflammation, it may be, before he could possibly return unto him: but  in case he found no ease, I wished him to come presently back again, if  not he might forbear coming. Thereupon he went, and at the instant I  did put again the garter into the water; thereupon he found his Master  without any pain at all. To be brief, there was no sense of pain  afterward: but within five or six dayes the wounds were cicatrized, and  entirely healed.\"(1)      (1) _Ibid_., pp. 7-11.      Sir KENELM proceeds, in this discourse, to relate that he obtained the  secret of the Powder from a Carmelite who had learnt it in the East.  Sir KENELM says that he told it only to King JAMES and his celebrated  physician, Sir THEODORE MAYERNE (1573-1655). The latter disclosed it to  the Duke of MAYERNE, whose surgeon sold the secret to various persons,  until ultimately, as Sir KENELM remarks, it became known to every  country barber. However, DIGBY'S real connection with the Powder has  been questioned. In an Appendix to Dr NATHANAEL HIGHMORE'S (1613-1685)  _The History of Generation_, published in 1651, entitled _A Discourse  of the Cure of Wounds by Sympathy_, the Powder is referred to as Sir  GILBERT TALBOT'S Powder; nor does it appear to have been DIGBY who  brought the claims of the Sympathetic Powder before the notice of  the then recently-formed Royal Society, although he was a by no means  inactive member of the Society. HIGHMORE, however, in the Appendix  to the work referred to above, does refer to DIGBY'S reputed cure of  HOWELL'S wounds already mentioned; and after the publication of DIGBY'S  _Discourse_ the Powder became generally known as Sir KENELM DIGBY'S  Sympathetic Powder. As such it is referred to in an advertisement  appended to _Wit and Drollery_ (1661) by the bookseller, NATHANAEL  BROOK.(1)      (1) This advertisement is as follows: \"These are to give notice, that  Sir _Kenelme Digbies_ Sympathetical Powder prepar'd by Promethean fire,  curing all green wounds that come within the compass of a Remedy; and  likewise the Tooth-ache infallibly in a very short time: Is to be had at  Mr _Nathanael Brook's_ at the Angel in _Cornhil_.\"    The belief in cure by sympathy, however, is much older than DIGBY'S or  TALBOT'S Sympathetic Powder. PARACELSUS described an ointment consisting  essentially of the moss on the skull of a man who had died a violent  death, combined with boar's and bear's fat, burnt worms, dried boar's  brain, red sandal-wood and mummy, which was used to cure (?) wounds in a  similar manner, being applied to the weapon with which the hurt had been  inflicted. With reference to this ointment, readers will probably recall  the passage in SCOTT'S _Lay of the Last Minstrel_ (canto 3, stanza 23),  respecting the magical cure of WILLIAM of DELORAINE'S wound by \"the  Ladye of Branksome\":--      \"She drew the splinter from the wound    And with a charm she stanch'd the blood;    She bade the gash be cleans'd and bound:    No longer by his couch she stood;    But she had ta'en the broken lance,    And washed it from the clotted gore    And salved the splinter o'er and o'er.    William of Deloraine, in trance,    Whene'er she turned it round and round,    Twisted as if she gall'd his wound.    Then to her maidens she did say    That he should be whole man and sound    Within the course of a night and day.    Full long she toil'd; for she did rue    Mishap to friend so stout and true.\"      FRANCIS BACON (1561-1626) writes of sympathetic cures as follows:--\"It  is constantly Received, and Avouched, that the _Anointing_ of the  _Weapon_, that maketh the _Wound_, wil heale the _Wound_ it selfe. In  this _Experiment_, upon the Relation of _Men of Credit_, (though my  selfe, as yet, am not fully inclined to beleeve it,) you shal note  the _Points_ following; First, the _Ointment_... is made of Divers  _ingredients_; whereof the Strangest and Hardest to come by, are the  Mosse upon the _Skull_ of a _dead Man, Vnburied_; And the _Fats_ of a  _Boare_, and a _Beare_, killed in the _Act of Generation_. These Two  last I could easily suspect to be prescribed as a Starting Hole; That if  the _Experiment_ proved not, it mought be pretended, that the _Beasts_  were not killed in due Time; For as for the _Mosse_, it is certain  there is great Quantity of it in _Ireland_, upon _Slain Bodies_, laid  on _Heaps, Vnburied_. The other _Ingredients_ are, the _Bloud-Stone_  in _Powder_, and some other _Things_, which seeme to have a _Vertue_ to  _Stanch Bloud_; As also the _Mosse_ hath.... Secondly, the same _kind_  of _Ointment_, applied to the Hurt it selfe, worketh not the _Effect_;  but onely applied to the _Weapon_..... Fourthly, it may be applied to  the _Weapon_, though the Party Hurt be at a great Distance. Fifthly, it  seemeth the _Imagination_ of the Party, to be _Cured_, is not needfull  to Concurre; For it may be done without the knowledge of the _Party  Wounded_; And thus much hath been tried, that the _Ointment_ (for  _Experiments_ sake,) hath been wiped off the _Weapon_, without the  knowledge of the _Party Hurt_, and presently the _Party Hurt_, hath been  in great _Rage of Paine_, till the _Weapon_ was _Reannointed_. Sixthly,  it is affirmed, that if you cannot get the _Weapon_, yet if you put an  _Instrument_ of _Iron_, or _Wood_, resembling the _Weapon_, into the  _Wound_, whereby it bleedeth, the _Annointing_ of that _Instrument_ will  serve, and work the _Effect_. This I doubt should be a Device, to keep  this strange _Forme of Cure_, in Request, and Use; Because many times  you cannot come by the _Weapon_ it selve. Seventhly, the _Wound_ be at  first _Washed clean_ with _White Wine_ or the _Parties_ own _Water_; And  then bound up close in _Fine Linen_ and no more _Dressing_ renewed, till  it be _whole_.\"(1)      (1) FRANCIS BACON: _Sylva Sylvarum: or, A Natural History... Published  after the Authors death... The sixt Edition_ u.. (1651), p. 217.      Owing to the demand for making this ointment, quite a considerable trade  was done in skulls from Ireland upon which moss had grown owing to  their exposure to the atmosphere, high prices being obtained for fine  specimens.    The idea underlying the belief in the efficacy of sympathetic remedies,  namely, that by acting on part of a thing or on a symbol of it, one  thereby acts magically on the whole or the thing symbolised, is the  root-idea of all magic, and is of extreme antiquity. DIGBY and others,  however, tried to give a natural explanation to the supposed efficacy  of the Powder. They argued that particles of the blood would ascend from  the bloody cloth or weapon, only coming to rest when they had reached  their natural home in the wound from which they had originally issued.  These particles would carry with them the more volatile part of the  vitriol, which would effect a cure more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#9)"],[1,"custom.\"    \"That custom,\" said the knight, \"have I followed and will follow, let  whosoever will say nay, and if any is aggrieved at it, let him who will  amend it.\"    \"I will amend it,\" said King Arthur.    \"And I will defend it,\" answered the knight.    Then the knight mounted his horse and made himself ready, and charging at  each other they met so hard that both their lances splintered into pieces.  Then King Arthur drew his sword, but the knight cried out, \"Not so; but  let us run another tilt together with sharp spears.\"    \"I would with a good will,\" said King Arthur; \"but I have no more spears.\"    \"I have enough of spears,\" replied the knight, and called a squire, who  brought two good new lances.    Then spurring their horses, they rushed together with all their might, and  broke each one his own spear short off in his hand. Then the king again  put his hand to his sword, but the knight once more cried out, \"Nay, yet  abide awhile; ye are the best jouster that I ever met with; for the love  of knighthood, let us joust yet once again.\"    So once again they tilted with their fullest force, and this time King  Arthur's spear was shivered, but the knight's held whole, and drove so  furiously against the king that both his horse and he were hurled to the  ground.    At that, King Arthur was enraged and drew his sword and said, \"I will  attack thee now, Sir knight, on foot, for on horseback I have lost the  honour.\"    \"I will be on horseback,\" said the knight. But when he saw him come on  foot, he lighted from his horse, thinking it shame to have so great  advantage.    And then began they a strong battle, with many great strokes and grievous  blows, and so hewed with their swords that the fragments of their armour  flew about the fields, and both so bled that all the ground around was  like a marsh of blood. Thus they fought long and mightily, and anon, after  brief rest fell to again, and so hurtled together like two wild boars that  they both rolled to the ground. At last their swords clashed furiously  together, and the knight's sword shivered the king's in two.    Then said the knight, \"Now art thou in my power, to save thee or to slay.  Yield therefore as defeated, and a recreant knight, or thou shall surely  die.\"    \"As for death,\" replied King Arthur, \"welcome be it when it cometh; but as  for yielding me to thee as a recreant because of this poor accident upon  my sword, I had far liefer die than be so shamed.\"    So saying, he sprang on the knight, and took him by the middle and threw  him down, and tore off his helm. But the knight, being a huge man,  wrestled and struggled in a frenzy with the king until he brought him  under, and tore off his helm in turn, and would have smitten off his head.    At that came Merlin and said, \"Knight, hold thy hand, for if thou slayest  yonder knight, thou puttest all this realm to greater loss and damage than  ever realm was in; for he is a man of greater worship than thou dreamest  of.\"    \"Who then is he?\" cried the knight.    \"Arthur Pendragon!\" answered Merlin.    Then would he have slain him for dread of his wrath, but Merlin cast a  spell upon the knight, so that he fell suddenly to the earth in a deep  sleep. Then raising up the king, he took the knight's horse for himself  and rode away.    \"Alas,\" said King Arthur, \"what hast thou done, Merlin? hast thou slain  this good knight by thy crafts? There never lived a better knight; I had  rather lose my kingdom for a year than have him dead.\"    \"Be not afraid,\" said Merlin; \"he is more whole and sound than thou art,  and is but in a sleep, wherefrom in three hours' time he will awake. I  told thee what a knight he was, and how near thou wast to death. There  liveth not a better knight than he in all the world, and hereafter he  shall do thee good service. His name is King Pellinore, and he shall have  two sons, who shall be passing valiant men, and, save one another, shall  have no equal in prowess and in purity of life. The one shall be named  Percival, and the other Lamoracke of Wales.\"    So they rode on to Caerleon, and all the knights grieved greatly when they  heard of this adventure, that the king would jeopardise his person thus  alone. Yet could they not hide their joy at serving under such a noble  chief, who adventured his own life as much as did the poorest knight among  them all.          CHAPTER IV    _King Arthur Conquers Ireland and Norway, Slays the Giant of St. Michael's  Mount, and Conquers Gaul--The Adventures of Sir Balin_      The land of Britain being now in peace, and many great and valiant knights  therein ready to take part in whatsoever battles or adventures might  arise, King Arthur resolved to follow all his enemies to their own coasts.  Anon he fitted out a great fleet, and sailing first to Ireland, in one  battle he miserably routed the people of the country. The King of Ireland  also he took prisoner, and forced all earls and barons to pay him homage.    Having conquered Ireland, he went next to Iceland and subdued it also, and  the winter being then arrived, returned to Britain.    In the next year he set forth to Norway, whence many times the heathen had  descended on the British coasts; for he was determined to give so terrible  a lesson to those savages as should be told through all their tribes both  far and near, and make his name fearful to them.    As soon as he was come, Riculf, the king, with all the power of that  country, met and gave him battle; but, after mighty slaughter, the Britons  had at length the advantage, and slew Riculf and a countless multitude  besides.    Having thus defeated them, they set the cities on fire, dispersed the  country people, and pursued the victory till they had reduced all Norway,  as also Dacia, under the dominion of King Arthur.    Now, therefore, having thus chastised those pagans who so long had  harassed Britain, and put his yoke upon them, he voyaged on to Gaul, being  steadfastly set upon defeating the Roman governor of that province, and so  beginning to make good the threats which he had sent the emperor by his  ambassadors.    So soon as he was landed on the shores of Gaul, there came to him a  countryman who told him of a fearful giant in the land of Brittany, who  had slain, murdered, and devoured many people, and had lived for seven  years upon young children only, \"insomuch,\" said the man, \"that all the  children of the country are destroyed; and but the other day he seized  upon our duchess, as she rode out with her men, and took her away to his  lodging in a cave of a mountain, and though five hundred people followed  her, yet could they give her no help or rescue, but left her shrieking and  crying lamentably in the giant's hands; and, Lord, she is thy cousin  Hoel's wife, who is of thy near kindred; wherefore, as thou art a rightful  king, have pity on this lady; and as thou art a valiant conqueror, avenge  us and deliver us.\"    \"Alas!\" said King Arthur, \"this is a great mischief that ye tell of. I had  rather than the best realm I have, that I had rescued that lady ere the  giant laid his hand on her; but tell me now, good fellow, canst thou bring  me where this giant haunteth?\"    \"Yea, Lord!\" replied the man; \"lo, yonder, where thou seest two great  fires, there shall thou find him, and more treasure also than is in all  Gaul besides.\"    Then the king returned to his tent, and, calling Sir Key and Sir Bedwin,  desired them to get horses ready for himself and them, for that after  evensong he would ride a pilgrimage with them alone to St. Michael's  Mount. So in the evening they departed, and rode as fast as they could  till they came near the mount, and there alighted; and the king commanded  the two knights to await him at the hill foot, while he went up alone.    Then he ascended the mountain till he came to a great fire. And there he  found a sorrowful widow wringing her hands and weeping miserably, sitting  by a new-made grave. And saluting her, King Arthur prayed her wherefore  she made such heavy lamentations.    \"Sir knight,\" she said, \"speak softly, for yonder is a devil, who, if he  hear thy voice, will come and straightway slay thee. Alas! what dost thou  here? Fifty such men as thou were powerless to resist him. Here lieth dead  my lady, Duchess of Brittany, wife to Sir Hoel, who was the fairest lady  in the world, foully and shamefully slaughtered by that fiend! Beware that  thou go not too nigh, for he hath overcome and vanquished fifteen kings,  and hath made himself a coat of precious stones, embroidered with their  beards; but if thou art hardy, and wilt speak with him, at yonder great  fire he is at supper.\"    \"Well,\" said King Arthur, \"I will accomplish mine errand, for all thy  fearful words;\" and so went forth to the crest of the hill, and saw where  the giant sat at supper, gnawing on a limb of a man, and baking his huge  frame by the fire, while three damsels turned three spits whereon were  spitted, like larks, twelve young children lately born.    [Illustration: The giant sat at supper, gnawing on a limb of a man, and  baking his huge frame by the fire.]    When King Arthur saw all that, his heart bled for sorrow, and he trembled  for rage and indignation; then lifting up his voice he cried aloud--\"God,  that wieldeth all the world, give thee short life and shameful death, and  may the devil have thy soul! Why hast thou slain those children and that  fair lady? Wherefore arise, and prepare thee to perish, thou glutton and  fiend, for this day thou shalt die by my hands.\"    Then the giant, mad with fury at these words, started up, and seizing a  great club, smote the king, and struck his crown from off his head. But  King Arthur smote him with his sword so mightily in return, that all his  blood gushed forth in streams.    At that the giant, howling in great anguish, threw away his club of iron,  and caught the king in both his arms and strove to crush his ribs  together. But"]]]
