[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#9)"],[1," he naturally turns  his attention to the value of the land, as from this he draws his views  of the prosperity of the country. Now, twenty-five years ago the  Argentine had comparatively very few railways; consequently, the lands  at any long distance from Buenos Aires (the capital) were at a very low  value. The province of Buenos Aires, the largest in the country, has  always been the most populated, and its lands have always commanded the  highest prices, and these have risen tremendously, but not so much of  late years in proportion as land in the northern provinces. During the  years 1885, 1886, 1887, and 1888, there was a great boom in land.  Foreigners were pouring in, bringing capital; great confidence was put  by foreign capitalists in the country, several railways had run out new  branches, new railways were built, new banks were opened, and a very  large extent of land was opened up and cultivated, and put under wheat  and linseed, harvests were good and money was flowing into the country.  Then came a very bad year, 1889; the harvest was practically lost owing  to the heavy and continuous rains which fell from December till July  with hardly a clear day. This, together with a bad government and the  revolution of 1890, created a great panic and a tremendous slump in all  land, from which it took a long time to recover. Where people had bought  camps and mortgaged them, which was the general thing to do in those  days, the mortgagees foreclosed, and, when the camps were auctioned  off, they did not fetch half what the properties had been bought for in  the first instance, some four or five years previously. This, naturally,  had a serious effect on the credit, soundness, and finances of the  country, but really, the crisis was not felt until some three or four  years after, and it was 1896 and 1897 which were very serious years for  the country.    To give one an idea of the value of land in four or five of the  principal provinces of the country, I must begin with the Queen  Province, as it is called, viz., Buenos Aires. In 1885, property in the  city centre was worth 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. a yard, whereas to-day it has  been sold up to L200 sterling per yard, while suburban lots of 20 yards  by 60 yards realised L5 and to-day are fetching L150, and camp lands  have risen from L10,000, to L100,000 the square league. Of course this  is within a radius of 30 to 50 leagues of the city; lands away to the  south and west may yet be bought at L10,000, and, still further south  towards Neuquen and the far Pampa, at L2,000 per square league. The  province of Buenos Aires is not considered good for alfalfa growing, but  has good natural grass camps.    The province of Santa Fe is a large province, extending from the  northern boundary of the province of Buenos Aires to Santiago del  Estero, and contains what is known as the Gran Chaco. The southern  portion of this province is largely dedicated to the production of  wheat, linseed, and maize, for which it is admirably adapted. There are  also large estancias carrying vast herds of cattle, sheep, and horses,  while the northern portion has vast forests of very fine and valuable  timber.    [Illustration: _Wheat ready for Loading at Station on Central Argentine  Railway._]    The first part of this province to be developed was the country around  Rosario, the large port on the River Parana, where ocean-going steamers  call. This, together with good railway accommodation in all directions  combined with excellent land in the district, facilitates the  cultivation of cereals on a very large scale. Property in Rosario itself  is very valuable, and from L30 to L50 a yard is a common figure. In the  immediate district of Rosario land is rarely sold in large areas, but  may be calculated at L20 an acre, whilst 40 leagues further north it is  to-day worth L50,000 a league. I know of one estancia of one league  which was bought in 1885 for L2,000, resold, after being sown down in  alfalfa and divided into paddocks, without further improvements, at  L12,000 (this was in 1903), and again sold in 1909, certainly with  further improvements as regards watering arrangements and more paddocks,  house, and sheds, etc., in fact, a fair model estancia in good working  order, for L60,000. Land on the south-west of Rosario, and about 40  leagues distant, has in the twenty-five years risen from L2,000 a league  to L40,000 a league. This is for virgin camp, and to-day in these  districts the average price can be stated at from L30,000 to L40,000 per  league, yet 300 miles further north land--good land--can be had at from  L4,000 to L6,000 per league.    The next province, Cordoba, is one of the most hilly in the country, and  has been one of the most developed during latter years. Some twenty  years ago this was almost considered a desert, where one was told  nothing would grow and cattle could not live. To-day it is one of the  most prosperous; wheat and linseed are great products here, while  alfalfa, when carefully treated, that is, not overstocked, lives for  ever on account of the sandy soil, and water being so near the surface.  These lands twenty years ago were valued at about L500 to L600 per  league, while to-day it is difficult to acquire land under cultivation  or alfalfa at less than L30,000 per league. In the Northern part of this  province are very valuable stone quarries.    Another province that is advancing very fast is that of San Luis. Here,  again, it has been found that alfalfa is at home, and thrives  splendidly. This, again, is a very sandy soil, and consequently is much  sought after, but this land has not yet touched the value of that in the  provinces already mentioned; it will not stand so much cropping, and  will not carry the same amount of stock, but still the average price for  virgin camp is from L5,000 to L10,000 per league. In this province there  is a very large extent of very poor land, covered with a small shrub,  which is not worth more than L2,000 a league.    Mendoza is a more northerly province, and mostly dedicated to the grape  and wine industry, while a lot of fruit is also exported from there.  Wine is made in very large quantities, and a lot of very good quality.  The value of land varies very much. The greater portion is worth at  present very little. The great point is to get the water concessions for  irrigating; without irrigation the land is useless. A good vineyard in  its prime, with good irrigation rights, is worth as much as from L40 to  L50 per acre, while the ordinary camp land is at about 7s. per acre.    [Illustration: _The Maker of Land Values._]          REMARKS ON STORMS AND THE CLIMATE OF THE ARGENTINE.      The Argentine Republic, like all hot countries, is subject to very great  hurricanes and storms. They occur most frequently in the spring and  summer, when very sudden changes of temperature take place. The  thermometer has often been known to drop 25 degrees within half an hour.    A great deal of damage is always caused, trees which have taken years of  care and trouble are ruthlessly uprooted, roofs blown off, windmills  blown down, haystacks turned over, and valuable animals struck by  lightning. The terrible closeness and stillness which generally precede  a \"tormenta\" are certain forerunners of bad weather and storms. A  terrible hailstorm which took place some time ago will always be  remembered by its spectators. The usual signs of it were evident; the  atmosphere had become very close and it had been extremely hot for some  hours before. Though only about 4 p.m., it got peculiarly dark and a  strong gale began to blow, and distant sounds of thunder were heard. A  sudden lull came, which meant that the storm was about to break; sheets  of lightning of every description were followed by deafening peals of  thunder, which made man and beast tremble. Then there came a downfall of  huge hailstones; they were just like big lumps of jagged ice; some of  them measured about six to eight inches round and weighed over half a  pound. This storm did a fearful lot of harm; not a leaf was left on a  single tree, and hundreds of birds lay dead all around. Though very  violent, this hailstorm did not last more than ten minutes, in which  time an incalculable amount of destruction took place.    In September, 1909, a very bad cyclone suddenly came on us. The sky  turned black and blacker, and the clouds looked horribly wicked.  Suddenly a terrific gale got up, which caused every window and door to  rattle in a most alarming manner, though they had all been as well  secured as possible. The dust seemed to filter in just the same, and in  five minutes the house was an inch thick in it. We heard a loud bang and  then another over our heads, and on looking out of a window we saw the  roof of one of the outer buildings lying on the ground; part of it had  been blown over our house and had carried away the chimney, a big iron  one, on its way. We were told afterwards that the cook had had to use  all her force against the kitchen window to keep it from bursting open,  as, if the wind had got in, it would have carried away that roof as  well. This hurricane lasted for about an hour and a-half; as soon as it  had abated somewhat we went out to see the result. Everywhere reigned  havoc and confusion, the whole place looked an old ruin, brick-bats,  tiles, broken branches, loose sheets of corrugated iron lying all  around; three roofs had been blown away, several windmills knocked down  and carried 100 yards away, and lovely old trees had been completely  uprooted.    The natives, frightened of remaining in their own quarters, had, in  their terror, deserted them and taken refuge, with their wives and  children, in the open camp, where they fondly imagined they were safer.  Out in the camp the roofs of most of the \"puestos,\" or huts, had been  also carried away, leaving the occupants exposed to the cold rains and  winds which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#9)"],[1,"if  the majority be Gentiles.    _Bava Metzia_, fol. 24, col. 1.    (Prov. xiv. 34), \"Almsgiving exalteth a nation, but benevolence is a sin  to nations.\" \"Almsgiving exalteth a nation,\" that is to say, the nation  of Israel; as it is written (2 Sam. vii. 23), \"And what one nation in  the earth is like thy people, even like Israel?\" but \"benevolence\" is a  sin to nations, that is to say, for the Gentiles to exercise charity and  benevolence is sin.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 10, col. 2.    If a Gentile smite an Israelite, he is guilty of death; as it is written  (Exod. ii. 12), \"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw  there was no man, he slew the Egyptian.\"    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 58, col. 2.    All Israelites have a portion in the world to come; as it is written  (Isa. lx. 21), \"And thy people are all righteous: they shall inherit the  land.\"    Ibid., fol. 90, col. 1.    \"And they shall fall one on account of another\" (Lev. xxvi. 37),--one on  account of the sins of another. This teaches us that all Israel are  surety for one another.    _Shevuoth_, fol. 39, col. 1.    If one find a foundling in a locality where the majority are Gentiles,  then the child is (to be reckoned) a Gentile; if the majority be  Israelites, it is to be considered as an Israelite; and so also it is to  be, providing the numbers are equal.    _Machsheerin_, chap. 2, Mish. 7.    \"One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but the  earth abideth forever\" (Eccl. i. 4). One empire cometh and another  passeth away, but Israel abideth forever.    _Perek Hashalom._    The world was created only for Israel: none are called the children of  God but Israel; none are beloved before God but Israel.    _Gerim_, chap. 1.    The Jew that has no wife abideth without joy, without a blessing, and  without any good. Without joy, as it is written (Deut. xiv. 26), \"And  thou shalt reject, thou and thy household;\" without blessing, as it is  written (Ezek. xliv. 30), \"That He may cause a blessing to rest on thy  household;\" without any good, for it is written (Gen. ii. 8), \"It is not  good that man should be alone.\"    _Yevamoth_, fol. 62, col. 2.    The Jew that has no wife is not a man; for it is written (Gen. v. 2),  \"Male and female created He them and called their name man.\" To which  Rabbi Eleazar adds, \"So every one who has no landed property is no man;  for it is written (Ps. cxv. 16), 'The heaven, even the heavens, are the  Lord's, but the earth (the land, that is), hath He given to the children  of man.'\"    _Yevamoth_, fol. 63, col. 1.    Three things did Moses ask of God:--1. He asked that the Shechinah might  rest upon Israel; 2. That the Shechinah might rest upon none but Israel;  and 3. That God's ways might be made known unto him; and all these  requests were granted.    _Berachoth_, fol. 7, col. 1.        What was the Shechinah? Was it the presence of a Divine person      or only of a Divine power? The following quotations will show      what is the teaching of the Talmud on the matter, and will be      read with interest by the theologian, whether Jew or Christian.        Where do we learn that when ten persons pray together the      Shechinah is with them? In Ps. lxxxii. 1, where it is written,      \"God standeth in the congregation of the mighty.\" And where do      we learn that when two sit together and study the law the      Shechinah is with them? In Mal. iii. 16, where it is written,      \"Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and      the Lord hearkened and heard it.\" (_Berachoth_, fol. 6, col. 1.)        Where do we learn that the Shechinah does strengthen the sick?      In Ps. xli. 3, where it is written, \"The Lord will strengthen      him upon the bed of languishing.\" (_Shabbath_, fol. 12, col. 2.)        He who goes from the Synagogue to the lecture-room, and from the      lecture-room back to the Synagogue, will become worthy to      receive the presence of the Shechinah; as it is written (Ps.      lxxxiv. 1), \"They go from strength to strength; every one of      them in Zion appeareth before God.\" (_Moed Katan_, fol. 29, col.      1.)        Rabbi Yossi says, \"The Shechinah never came down here below, nor      did Moses and Elijah ever ascend on high, because it is written      (Ps. cxv. 16), 'The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's,      but the earth hath he given to the children of men.'\" (_Succah_,      fol. 5, col. 1.)        Esther \"stood in the inner court of the King's house\" (Esth. v,      1). Rabbi Levi says, \"When she reached the house of the images      the Shechinah departed from her. Then she exclaimed, 'My God! my      God! why hast thou forsaken me?'\" (_Meggillah_, fol. 15, col. 2.)        \"But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every      one of you this day\" (Deut. iv. 4). Is it possible to cleave to      the Shechinah? Is it not written (_ibid._, verse 24), \"For the      Lord thy God is a consuming fire\"? The reply is:--He that      bestows his daughter in marriage on a disciple of the wise (that      is, a Rabbi), or does business on behalf of the disciples of the      wise, or maintains them from his property, Scripture accounts it      as if he did cleave to the Shechinah. (_Kethuboth_, fol. iii,      col. 25.)        He who is angry has no regard even for the Shechinah; as it is      written (Ps. x. 4), \"The wicked, when his anger rises, does not      inquire after God; God is not in all his thoughts.\" (_Nedarim_,      fol. 22, col. 2.)        He who visits the sick should not sit upon the bed, nor even      upon a stool or a chair beside it, but he should wrap his mantle      round him and sit upon the floor, because of the Shechinah which      rests at the head of the bed of the invalid; as it is written      (Ps. xli. 3), \"The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of      languishing.\" (Ibid., fol. 40, col. 1.)        When Israel went up out of the Red Sea, both the babe on its      mother's lap and the suckling at the breast saw the Shechinah,      and said, \"This is my God, and I will prepare Him a habitation;\"      as it is written (Ps. viii. 2), \"Out of the mouths of babes and      sucklings thou hast ordained strength.\" (_Soteh_, fol. 30, col.      2.)        Where do we read that the Shechinah is present everywhere? In      Zech. ii. 3, where it is written, \"And behold the angel that      talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet      him.\" It is not said went out after him, but \"went out to meet      him.\" From this we know that the Shechinah is present      everywhere. (_Bava Bathra_ fol. 25, col. 1.)    Rabbi Akiva says, \"For three things I admire the Medes:--1. When they  carve meat, they do it on the table; 2. When they kiss, they only do so  upon the hand; 3. And when they consult, they do so only in the field.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 8, col. 2.    The stone which Og, king of Bashan, meant to throw upon Israel is the  subject of a tradition delivered on Sinai. \"The camp of Israel I see,\"  he said, \"extends three miles; I shall therefore go and root up a  mountain three miles in extent and throw it upon them.\" So off he went,  and finding such a mountain, raised it on his head, but the Holy  One--blessed be He!--sent an army of ants against him, which so bored  the mountain over his head that it slipped down upon his shoulders, from  which he could not lift it, because his teeth, protruding, had riveted  it upon him. This explains that which is written (Ps. iii. 7), \"Thou  hast broken the teeth of the ungodly;\" where read not \"Thou hast  broken,\" but \"Thou hast ramified,\" that is, \"Thou hast caused to branch  out.\" Moses being ten ells in height, seized an axe ten ells long, and  springing up ten ells, struck a blow on Og's ankle and killed him.    Ibid., fol. 54, col. 2.        This same story is given with more than Talmudic exaggeration in      the Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel, while the author of the Book      of Jasher (chap. lxv., verses 23, 24) makes the camp and the      mountain forty miles in extent. The giant here figures in      antediluvian tradition. He is said to have been saved at the      Flood by laying hold of the ark, and being fed day by day      through a hole in the side of the ark by Noah himself. A      tradition which says the soles of his feet were forty miles long      at once explains all the extraordinary feats ascribed to him.    Rav Yehudah used to say, \"Three things shorten a man's days and  years:--1. Neglecting to read the law when it is given to him for that  purpose; seeing it is written (Deut. xxx. 20), 'For He (who gave it) is  thy life and the length of thy days.' 2. Omitting to repeat the  customary benediction over a cup of blessing; for it is written (Gen.  xii. 3), 'And I will bless them that bless thee.' 3. And the assumption  of a Rabbinical air; for Rabbi Chama bar Chanena says, 'Joseph died  before any of his brethren, because he domineered over them.'\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 55, col. 1.        The first of these refers to the reading of the law in public      worship, the second to a practice after meals when more than two      adult Jews were present, and the third to the dictatorial air      often assumed by the Rabbis.    Three things proceed by pre-eminence from God Himself:--Famine, plenty,  and a wise ruler. Famine (2 Kings viii. 2): \"The Lord hath called for a  famine;\" plenty (Ezek. xxxvi. 29): \"I will call for corn and increase  it;\" a wise ruler; for it is written (Exod. xxxi. 2), \"I have called by  name Bezaleel.\" Rabbi Yitzchak says, \"A ruler is not to be appointed  unless the community be first consulted. God first consulted Moses, then  Moses consulted the nation concerning the appointment of Bezaleel.\"    Ibid., fol. 55, col. 1.    Three dreams come to pass:--That which is dreamed in the morning; that  which is also dreamed by one's neighbor; and a dream which is  interpreted within a dream; to which some add, one that is dreamed by  the"]]]
