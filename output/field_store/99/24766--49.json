That this was wrong and mischievous is granted; but  it is ordinary human conduct now as then. It was a most illogical,  capricious, and dangerous form of enforcing punishment, abating  nuisances, and shutting out disagreeable truths; fertile in injustice,  oppression, the shedding of innocent blood, and the extinguishing of  light. No one can justify it, or plead beneficial results from it which  could not have been secured with far less evil in other ways. But it was  natural that, believing the crime to exist, they should use the belief  to strike down offenders or annoyances out of reach of any other _legal_  means. They did not invent the crime for the purpose, nor did they  invent the death penalty for this crime.\" _Connecticut as a Colony_  (1: 206), MORGAN.    \"As to what you mention, concerning that poor creature in your town that  is afflicted and mentioned my name to yourself and son, I return you  hearty thanks for your intimation about it, and for your charity therein  mentioned; and I have great cause to bless God, who, of his mercy  hitherto, hath not left me to fall into such an horrid evil.\" Extract of  a Letter from Sec. Allyn to Increase Mather, Hartford, Mar. 18, 1692-93.      An accusation of witchcraft was a serious matter, one of life or death,  and often it was safer to become an accuser than one of the accused.  Made in terror, malice, mischief, revenge, or religious dementia, or of  some other ingredients in the Devil's brew, it passed through the  stages of suspicion, espionage, watchings, and searchings, to the formal  complaints and indictments which followed the testimony of the  witnesses, in their madness and delusion hot-foot to tell the story of  their undoing, their grotesque imaginings, their spectral visions, their  sufferings at the hands of Satan and his tools, and all aimed at people,  their neighbors and acquaintances, often wholly innocent, but having  marked personal peculiarities, or of irregular lives by the Puritan  standard, or unpopular in their communities, who were made the victim of  one base passion or another and brought to trial for a capital offense  against person and property.    Taking into account the actual number of accusations, trials, and  convictions or acquittals, the number of witnesses called and  depositions given was very great. And the later generations owe their  opportunity to judge aright in the matter, to the foresight of the men  of chief note in the communities who saw the vital necessity of record  evidence, and so early as 1666, in the General Court of Connecticut, it  was ordered that    \"Whatever testimonies are improved in any court of justice in this  corporation in any action or case to be tried, shall be presented in  writing, and so kept by the secretary or clerk of the said court on  file.\"    This preliminary analysis brings the searcher for the truth face to face  with the very witnesses who have left behind them, in the attested  records, the ludicrous or solemn, the pitiable or laughable memorials of  their own folly, delusion, or deviltry, which marked them then and now  as Satan's chosen servitors.    Among the many witnesses and their statements on oath now made  available, the chief difficulty is one of selection and elimination; and  there will be presented here with the context some of the chief  depositions[F] and statements in the most notable witchcraft trials in  some of the Connecticut towns, that are typical of all of them, and show  upon what travesties of evidence the juries found their verdicts and the  courts imposed their sentences.      [Footnote F: The selected testimonies herein given are from the  Connecticut and New Haven colonial records; from the original  depositions in some of the witchcraft cases, in manuscript, a part of  the _Wyllys Papers_, so called, now in the Connecticut State Library;  and from the notes and papers on witchcraft of the late Charles J.  Hoadley, LL.D., compiler of the colonial and state records, and for  nearly a half century the state librarian.]      KATHERINE (KATERAN) HARRISON    At a Court of Assistants held at Hartford May 11, 1669, presided over by  Maj. John Mason--the conqueror of the Pequots--then Deputy Governor,  Katherine Harrison, after an examination by the court on a charge of  suspicion of witchcraft, was committed to the common jail, to be kept in  durance until she came to trial and deliverance by the law.    At an adjourned session of the court at Hartford, May 25, 1669, presided  over by John Winthrop, Governor, with William Leete, Deputy Governor,  Major Mason and others as assistants, an indictment was found against  the prisoner in these words:    \"Kateran Harrison thou standest here indicted by ye name of Kateran  Harrison (of Wethersfield) as being guilty of witchcraft for that thou  not haueing the fear of God before thine eyes hast had familiaritie with  Sathan the grand enemie of god and mankind and by his help hast acted  things beyond and beside the ordinary course of nature and hast thereby  hurt the bodyes of divers of the subjects of or souraigne Lord the King  of which by the law of god and of this corporation thou oughtest to  dye.\"    Katherine plead not guilty and \"refered herself to a tryall by the jury  present,\" to whom this solemn oath was administered:    \"You doe sware by the great and dreadful name of the everliuing god that  you will well and truely try just verdict give and true deliverance make  between or Souraigne Lord the King and such prisoner or prisoners at the  barr as shall be given you in charge according to the Evidence given in  Court and the lawes so help you god in or lord Jesus.\"    A partial trial was had at the May session of the court, but the jury  could not agree upon a verdict, and adjournment was had until the  October session, when a verdict was to be given in, and the prisoner was  remanded to remain in prison in the meantime.    It seems incredible that men like Winthrop and Mason, Treat and Leete,  and others of the foremost rank in those days, could have served as  judges in such trials, and in all earnestness and sincerity listened to  and given credence to the drivel, the travesties of common sense, the  mockeries of truth, which fell from the lips of the witnesses in their  testimonies. Some of the absurd charges against Katherine Harrison  invite particular attention and need no comment. They speak for  themselves.      THOMAS BRACY (probably Tracy)--_Misfit jacket and breeches--Vision of  the red calf's head--Murderous counsel--\"Afflictinge\"_    \"Thomas Bracy aged about 31 years testifieth as follows that formerly  James Wakeley would haue borrowed a saddle of the saide Thomas Bracy,  which Thomas Bracy denyed to lend to him, he threatened Thomas and  saide, it had bene better he had lent it to him.

The lady appealed to a limited constituency, like M.H.;  but her pages, such as they are (for there are but thirty), are now  _publici juris_. The lesson to be drawn from Mistress Tillinghast's  printed labours is that, among our ancestors in 1678, pies and pasties  of all sorts, and sweet pastry, were in increased vogue. Her slender  volume is filled with elucidations on the proper manufacture of paste  of various sorts; and in addition to the pies designated by M.H. we  encounter a Lombard pie, a Battalia pie, an artichoke pie, a potato  (or secret) pie, a chadron [Footnote: A pie chiefly composed of a  calf's chadroa] pie, and a herring pie. The fair author takes care  to instruct us as to the sauces or dressings which are to accompany  certain of her dishes.    \"The Book of Cookery,\" 1500, of which there was a reprint by John  Byddell about 1530 was often republished, with certain modifications,  down to 1650, under the titles of \"A Proper New Book of Cookery,\"  or \"The Book of Cookery.\" Notwithstanding the presence of many  competitors, it continued to be a public favourite, and perhaps  answered the wants of those who did not desire to see on their tables  the foreign novelties introduced by travellers, or advertised in  collections of receipts borrowed from other languages.    In fact, the first half of the seventeenth century did not witness  many accessions to the store of literature on this subject. But from  the time of the Commonwealth, the supply of works of reference for the  housekeeper and the cook became much more regular and extensive. In  1653, Selden's friend, the Countess of Kent, brought out her \"Choice  Manual of Physic and Chirurgery,\" annexing to it receipts for  preserving and candying; and there were a few others, about the same  time, of whose works I shall add here a short list:--    1. The Accomplished Cook. By Robert May. 8vo, 1660. Fifth edition,  8vo, 1685.    2. The Whole Body of Cookery Dissected. By Will. Rabisha. 8vo, 1661.    3.

Translated by D.  Hay, M.D. 8vo, 1745.    This completes the list of books, so far as they have fallen in my  way, or been pointed out by the kindness of friends, down to the  middle of the last century.    It was probably Charles, Duke of Bolton (1698-1722), who was at one  time Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and who in the beginning of his ducal  career, at all events, resided in St. James's Street, that possessed  successively as head-cooks John Nott and John Middleton. To each of  these artists we owe a volume of considerable pretensions, and the  \"Cook's and Confectioner's Dictionary,\" 1723, by the former, is  positively a very entertaining and cyclopedic publication. Nott  inscribes his book \"To all Good Housewives,\" and declares that he  placed an Introduction before it merely because fashion had made it  as strange for a book to appear without one as for a man to be seen  in church without a neckcloth or a lady without a hoop-petticoat. He  congratulates himself and his readers on living in a land flowing with  milk and honey, quotes the saw about God sending meat and somebody  else sending cooks, and accounts for his omission of pigments by  saying, like a gallant man, that his countrywomen little needed such  things. Nott opens with _Some Divertisements in Cookery, us'd at  Festival-Times, as Twelfth-Day, etc._, which are highly curious,  and his dictionary itself presents the novelty of being arranged,  lexicon-wise, alphabetically. He seems to have been a fairly-read and  intelligent man, and cites, in the course of his work, many celebrated  names and receipts. Thus we have:--To brew ale Sir Jonas Moore's way;  to make Dr. Butler's purging ale; ale of health and strength, by the  Viscount St. Albans; almond butter the Cambridge way; to dress a leg  of mutton _a la Dauphine_; to dress mutton the Turkish way; to stew  a pike the City way. Dr. Twin's, Dr. Blacksmith's, and Dr. Atkin's  almond butter; an amber pudding, according to the Lord Conway's  receipt; the Countess of Rutland's Banbury cake; to make Oxford cake;  to make Portugal cakes; and so on. Nott embraces every branch of his  subject, and furnishes us with bills of fare for every month of the  year, terms and rules of carving, and the manner of setting out  a dessert of fruits and sweetmeats. There is a singular process  explained for making China broth, into which an ounce of china is  to enter. Many new ways had been gradually found of utilising the  materials for food, and vegetables were growing more plentiful. The  carrot was used in soups, puddings, and tarts. Asparagus and spinach,  which are wanting in all the earlier authorities, were common, and the  barberry had come into favour. We now begin to notice more frequent  mention of marmalades, blanc-manges, creams, biscuits, and sweet  cakes. There is a receipt for a carraway cake, for a cabbage pudding,  and for a chocolate tart.    The production by his Grace of Bolton's other _chef_, John Middleton,  is \"Five Hundred New Receipts in Cookery, Confectionary, Pastry,  Preserving, Conserving, Pickling,\" and the date is 1734. Middleton  doubtless borrowed a good deal from his predecessor; but he also  appears to have made some improvements in the science. We have here  the methods, to dress pikes _a la sauce Robert_, to make blackcaps  (apples baked in their skins); to make a Wood Street cake; to make  Shrewsbury cakes; to dress a leg of mutton like a gammon of bacon;  to dress eggs _a la Augemotte_; to make a dish of quaking pudding of  several colours; to make an Italian pudding, and to make an Olio. The  eye seems to meet for the first time with hasty pudding, plum-porridge  (an experiment toward the solidification of the older plum-broth),  rolled beef-steaks, samphire, hedgehog cream (so called from its  shape, currants being used for the eyes, and cut almonds for the  bristles), cocks'-combs, orange, spinach and bean tarts, custards  in cups (the 1723 book talks of jellies served on china plates), and  lastly, jam--the real jam of these days, made to last, as we are  told, the whole year. There is an excellent prescription for making  elderberry wine, besides, in which Malaga raisins are to be largely  used. \"In one year,\" says our _chef_, \"it will be as good and as  pleasant as French wine.\"    Let us extract the way \"to make Black-caps\":--\"Take a dozen of good  pippins, cut them in halves, and take out the cores; then place them  on a right Mazarine dish with the skins on, the cut side downwards;  put to them a very little water, scrape on them some loaf sugar, put  them in a hot oven till the skins are burnt black, and your apples  tender; serve them on Plates strew'd over with sugar.\"    Of these books, I select the preface to \"The Complete Housewife,\" by  E. Smith, 1736, because it appears to be a somewhat more ambitious  endeavour in an introductory way than the authors of such undertakings  usually hazard. From the last paragraph we collect that the writer was  a woman, and throughout she makes us aware that she was a person of  long practical experience. Indeed, as the volume comprehends a variety  of topics, including medicines, Mrs. or Miss Smith must have been  unusually observant, and have had remarkable opportunities of making  herself conversant with matters beyond the ordinary range of culinary  specialists. I propose presently to print a few samples of her  workmanship, and a list of her principal receipts in that section of  the book with which I am just now concerned. First of all, here is the  Preface, which begins, as we see, by a little piece of plagiarism from  Nott's exordium:--      \"_PREFACE._    \"It being grown as unfashionable for a book now to appear in publick  without a preface, as for a lady to appear at a ball without a  hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to custom for fashion-sake, and not  through any"]]]
