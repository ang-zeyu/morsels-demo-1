It was soon seen that the  little animal was directing its course across a bay toward the nearest  borders of the forest, and immediately the owner of the hound crossed  the bridge, running at full speed in the same direction, hoping to  stop his dog as he landed. On the fawn swam, as it never swam before,  its delicate head scarcely seen above the water, but leaving a  disturbed track, which betrayed its course alike to anxious friends  and fierce enemies. As it approached the land, the exciting interest  became intense. The hunter was already on the same line of shore,  calling loudly and angrily to his dog, but the animal seemed to have  quite forgotten his master's voice in the pitiless pursuit. The fawn  touched the land--in one leap it had crossed the narrow line of beach,  and in another instant it would reach the cover of the woods. The  hound followed, true to the scent, aiming at the same spot on the  shore; his master, anxious to meet him, had run at full speed, and was  now coming up at the most critical moment; would the dog hearken to  his voice, or could the hunter reach him in time to seize and control  him? A shout from the village bank proclaimed that the fawn had passed  out of sight into the forest; at the same instant, the hound, as he  touched the land, felt the hunter's strong arm clutching his neck.  The worst was believed to be over; the fawn was leaping up the  mountain-side, and its enemy under restraint. The other dogs, seeing  their leader cowed, were easily managed. A number of persons, men and  boys, dispersed themselves through the woods in search of the little  creature, but without success; they all returned to the village,  reporting that the animal had not been seen by them. Some persons  thought that after its fright had passed over it would return of  its own accord. It had worn a pretty collar, with its owner's name  engraved upon it, so that it could easily be known from any other fawn  that might be straying about the woods. Before many hours had passed a  hunter presented himself to the lady whose pet the little creature had  been, and showing a collar with her name on it said that he had been  out in the woods, and saw a fawn in the distance: the little animal  instead of bounding away as he expected, moved toward him; he took  aim, fired, and shot it to the heart. When he found the collar about  its neck he was very sorry he had killed it. And so the poor little  thing died; one would have thought that terrible chase would have  made it afraid of man: but no, it forgot the evil and remembered the  kindness only, and came to meet as a friend the hunter who shot it. It  was long mourned by its best friend.           *       *       *       *       *        MISCELLANIES.    CIRCUMNAVIGATING A POPE.--Cardinal Maury did not allow you to advance  far. He was fond of telling anecdotes, but he loved to select his  subject and to choose his terms. Memory well managed can furnish a  tolerable share of the wit and spirit of conversation, and he was, in  this respect, the most capital manoeuvrer I ever met with. As he had  been absent from Paris for fourteen years he had a great deal to tell.  Every one, therefore, listened to his stories with pleasure--himself  among the first. Even at the dinner-table he permitted himself the  indulgence of a vast quantity of Spanish snuff, which he generally  shared with his neighbors, distributing a large portion on their  plates, which rather spoiled the pleasure of those who had the good  fortune to be seated next to him, as it once happened to me at Madame  du Roure's. While singing the praises of his beautiful villa at  Monte-Fiascone, he frequently drew from his pocket an enormous  snuff-box, the contents of which were most liberally showered down  upon the company placed near him, and, between two pinches, he  informed us that he had formerly the pretension of taking the very  best snuff in France. He prepared it with his own hands, and spared  no pains in the important proceeding. When he emigrated to Rome he  carried with him two jars of the precious mixture. The future destiny  of the Abbe Maury was dependent on the pope, and he was a great  snuff-taker! \"I presented myself several times (I quote his own  expressions) before his holiness, and took great care never to omit  displaying my snuff-box, which I opened and shut several times during  the interview, making as loud a noise as possible. This was all I  dared do,--respect forbade me making any advances toward his holiness  by offering directly a taste of the mixture of which I was so justly  proud. At length my perseverance met with its reward. One day I  managed skillfully to push the snuff-box beneath his hand, and, in the  heat of argument, he opened it mechanically, and took a pinch of snuff  therefrom. It was an awful moment, as you may imagine. I observed him  with the greatest attention, and immediately remarked the expression  of satisfaction and surprise which overspread his features as he  stretched forth his fingers to take another pinch. \"_Donde vi viene  questo maraviglioso tobacco?_\" I told him that I alone possessed the  mixture, and that I had only two jars left, or rather that I had no  more, as, of course, they now belonged to his holiness. I am inclined  to believe that this present was agreeable to him, as it was useful to  me.\" After the story the cardinal boasted to us of the extraordinary  frankness of his character. He had shown more of this than he had  intended in the tale he had been telling.    --Souvenirs de France et d'Italie dans les Annees 1830, 1831 et 1832.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Deutsche Reform_ publishes as a curiosity a selection, though an  imperfect one, from the catalogue of the flying leaves and small cheap  journals, political and satirical, that sprung into existence after  the revolution, mostly in Berlin and Vienna; not more than three or  four of them now exist. The insect world was a favorite source of  names for the satirist, the sting of whose production was frequently  only in the title: every week produced the _Hornet_, the _Wasp_, the  _Gadfly_, and their plurals, the _Wasps_ and the _Gadflies_; there  was also an _Imperial Gadfly_, and one _Wasp's Nest_. The necessity  of enlightenment exhausted the means of doing it through the _Torch_,  the _Taper_, the _Jet of Gas_, the _Lamp_, the _Everburning Lamp_ (the  last flickers still at uncertain intervals, the extinguisher of the  Berlin police coming down on it whenever it appears), the _Lantern_  and the _White Lamp_, the _Snuffers_ followed the list of lights, and  the whole category concluded in an _Egyptian Darkness_, to which most  of them have descended. The other titles are not so well classified:  there was a _Democratic Reasoner_, a _Shrieker_ (or _Shouter_), and  the _Berlin Widemouth_, the _Barricade Journal_, the _Street Journal_,  the _Cat's Music_, the _Red Cap_, the _Sansculottes_ (_Ohne-Hosen_),  the _Tower of Fools_, are miscellaneous: there was a variety of  devils--the _Travelling Devil_, the _Devil Untied_, the _Church  Devil_, the _Revolutionary Devil_. Some of the titles were cant words,  quite untranslatable, as _Kladderadatsch_ (the Berlin _Punch_, still  existing), the _Klitsch-Klatsch_, and the _Pumpernickel_ (a kind of  black bread); the three last were--_The Prussians Have Come_, the  _General Wash_, and the _Political Ass_. In the provincial towns  all the flying leaves were something for the people--_Volks-boten,  Volks-freunde, Volks-zeitung_--in a list that would be too long to  repeat.           *       *       *       *       *    TRUE PROGRESS.--The civilization of antiquity was the advancement  of the few and the slavery of the many--in Greece 30,000 freemen and  300,000 slaves--and it passed away. True civilization must be measured  by the progress, not of a class or nation, but of all men. God admits  none to advance alone. Individuals in advance become martyrs--nations  in advance the prey of the barbarian. Only as one family of man can  we progress. But man must exist as an animal before he can exist as a  man: his physical requirements must be satisfied before those of mind;  and hitherto it has taken the whole time and energies of the many to  provide for their physical wants. Such wants have spread mankind over  the whole globe--the brute and the savage have disappeared before the  superior race--the black blood of the torrid zone has been mixed with  the white of the temperate, and a superior race, capable of living  and laboring under a zenith sun, has been formed, and we seem to be  preparing for a united movement onward. The elements have been pressed  into our service, the powers of steam and electricity would appear  boundless, and science has given man an almost unlimited control over  nature. The trammels which despotisms have hitherto imposed on body  and mind have been thrown off, and constitutional liberty has rapidly  and widely spread. The steamship and railway, and mutual interests in  trade and commerce, have united nation to nation, and the press has  given one mind and simultaneous thoughts to the whole community. Power  there is in plenty for the emancipation of the whole race; since the  steam engine and machinery may be to the working-classes what they  have hitherto been to those classes above them. All that is wanted  is to know how to use these forces for the general good.

If they forgot  September 2d, he could jog their memories that Cromwell's death on  September 3d, two centuries before, was no excuse for ignoring his  birth on September 3d, 1850.    Whether born on the anniversary of Cromwell's death or in the  boiler-shop, no stories of the youthful precocity of Eugene Field  survive to entertain us or to suggest that he gave early indication of  the possession either of unusual talent or of that unique personality  that were to distinguish him from the thousands born every day.    But Eugene and Roswell, Jr., were not long to know the watchful  tenderness and ambitious solicitude of that \"mother love\" of which the  elder has so sweetly sung. In November, 1856, when Eugene was six  years old, their mother died and their father's thoughts instinctively  turned to his sister, hoping to find with her, amid scenes familiar to  his own youth, a home and affectionate care for his motherless boys.  How the early loss of his mother affected the life of Eugene Field it  is impossible to tell. Not until the boy of six whom she left had  become a man of forty did he attempt to pay a tribute of filial love  to her memory. The following lines, under the simple title, \"To My  Mother,\" first appeared in his \"Sharps and Flats\" column, October  25th, 1890. It was reprinted in his \"Second Book of Verse.\" The  opening lines summon up a tender picture of a \"grace that is dead\":      _How fair you are, my mother!    Ah, though 'tis many a year    Since you were here,    Still do I see your beauteous face    And with the glow    Of your dark eyes cometh a grace    Of long ago._    The Mistress French of our earlier acquaintance, who was a widow when  we last knew her in Newfane, had married again and, as Mistress Thomas  Jones, had moved with her daughter, Mary Field French, to Amherst,  Mass. To the home of Mrs. Jones and the loving care of Miss French,  Eugene and Roswell, Jr., were entrusted. Miss French was at this time a  young woman, a spinster--Eugene delighted to call her--of about thirty  years. His old Munson tutor thus describes her:    \"Mary Field French, a daughter of Mrs. Jones by her first husband, was  a lady of strong mind, and much culture, with a sound judgment and  decision of character and very gracious manners. She was always  sociable and agreeable and so admirably adapted to the charge of the  two brothers.\" They retained through manhood the warmest affection for  this cousin-mother, and never wearied in showing toward her the  grateful devotion of loyal sons.    \"Here,\" continues Dr. Tufts, \"in this charming home, under the best of  New England influences and religious instruction, with nothing harsh or  repulsive, the boys could not have found a more congenial home. Indeed,  few mothers are able or even capable of doing so much for their own  children as Miss French did for these two brothers, watching over them  incessantly, yet not spoiling them by weak indulgence or repelling them  by harsh discipline.\"    [Illustration: EUGENE FIELD'S COUSINS, MARY FIELD FRENCH AND HER  YOUNGER HALF SISTER, AUGUSTA JONES.  _From a daguerreotype taken before Eugene and Roswell became members  of Miss French's family in Amherst, on the death of their mother._]    Here it was that Eugene was brought up in the \"nurture and admonition  of the Lord,\" as he would often declare with a mock severity of tone,  that left a mixed impression as to the beneficence of the nurture and  the abiding quality of the admonition. Here he spent his school days,  not in acquiring a broad or deep basis for future scholarship, but in  studying the ways and whims of womankind, in practising the subtile  arts whereby the boy of from six to fifteen attains a tyrannous mastery  over the hearts of a feminine household, and in securing the leadership  among the daring spirits of his own age and sex, for whom he was early  able to furnish a continuous programme of entertainment, adventure, and  mischief.    Of this period of Eugene Field's life we get the truest glimpse through  the eyes of his brother, who has written appreciatively of their  boyhood spent in Amherst. \"His boyhood,\" writes Roswell, \"was similar  to that of other boys brought up with the best surroundings in a  Massachusetts village, where the college atmosphere prevailed. He had  his boyish pleasures and his trials, his share of that queer mixture of  nineteenth century worldliness and almost austere Puritanism, which is  yet characteristic of many New England families.\"    If the reader wishes to know more of the New England atmosphere, in  which Eugene Field was permitted to have pretty much his own sweet way  by his cousin and aunt, let him have recourse to Mrs. Earle's \"The  Sabbath in Puritan New England,\" which I find in my library commended  to my perusal, \"with Eugene Field's love, December 25th, 1891\"--and to  other books by the same author. In a letter to Mrs. Earle, from which I  quoted in the opening paragraph of this narrative, I find the following  reference to the period of his life which we are now considering:    \"Fourteen years of my life were spent in Newfane, Vt., and Amherst,  Mass. My lovely old grandmother was one of the very elect. How many  times have I carried her footstove for her and filled it in the  vestry-room. I have frozen in the old pew while grandma kept nice and  warm and nibbled lozenges and cassia cakes during meeting. I remember  the old sounding-board. There was no melodeon in that meeting-house;  and the leader of the choir pitched the tune with a tuning-fork. As a  boy I used to play hi-spy in the horse-shed. But I am not so very  old--no, a man is still a boy at forty, isn't he?\"    [Illustration: THE FIELD HOMESTEAD AT NEWFANE, VT.]    Eugene Field would have been a boy at fifty and at eighty had he lived,  and he was very much of a boy at the period of which he wrote to Mrs.  Earle. I have no doubt that he was a very circumspect lad while under  the loving yet stern glance of that dear old grandmother, in whose  kindly yet dignified presence three generations of Fields moved with  varying emotions of love and circumspection. \"Her husband\" (General  Martin Field of our acquaintance), wrote \"Uncle Charles Kellogg,\" \"was  genial and social, full of humor and mirth, oftentimes filling the  house with his jocund laugh.\" She, however, \"true to her refined  womanly instinct, her sense of propriety, rarely disturbed by his merry  and harmless jests, with great discretion pursued 'the even tenor of  her way.' Patiently and with unfaltering devotion to the higher and  nobler purposes of life, she always maintained her self-possession,  strenuously avoided all levity and frivolity, rarely relaxed the  gravity of her deportment, and never failed in the end of controlling  both husband and household.\"    Eugene's own picture of his grandmother is contained in the following  passage in an article contributed by him to the Ladies' Home Journal:      \"Grandma was a pillar in the Congregational Church. At the decline    and disintegration of the Universalist society, she rejoiced    cordially as if a temple of Baal or an idol of Ashtaroth had been    overturned. Yes, grandma was Puritanical--not to the extent of    persecution, but a Puritan in the severity of her faith and in the    exacting nicety of her interpretation of her duties to God and    mankind. Grandma's Sunday began at six o'clock Saturday evening; by    that hour her house was swept and garnished, and her lamps trimmed,    every preparation made for a quiet, reverential observance of the    Sabbath Day. There was no cooking on Sunday. At noon Mrs. Deacon    Ranney and other old ladies used to come from church with grandma to    eat luncheon and discuss the sermon and suggest deeds of piety for    the ensuing week. I remember Mrs. Deacon Ranney and her frigid    companions very distinctly. They never smiled and they wore austere    bombazines that rustled and squeaked dolorously. Mrs. Deacon Ranney    seldom noticed me further than to regard me with a look that seemed    to stigmatize me as an incipient vessel of wrath that was not to be    approved of, and I never liked Mrs. Deacon Ranney after I heard her    reminding grandma one day that Solomon had truly said, 'spare the    rod and spoil the child.' I still think ill of Mrs. Deacon Ranney    for having sought to corrupt dear old grandma's gentle nature with    any such incendiary suggestions. The meeting-house was cold and    draughty, and the seats, with their straight backs, were oh, so    hard. Grandma's pew was near the pulpit. I remember now how ashamed    I used to be to carry her footstove all the way up that long aisle    for her--I was such a foolish little boy then--and now, ah me, how    ready and glad and proud I should be to do that service for dear old    grandma!      \"When grandma went to meeting she carried a lovely big black velvet    bag; it had a bouquet wrought in beads of subdued color upon it, and    it hung by two sombre silk puckering ribbons over grandma's arm. In    the bag grandma carried a supply of crackers and peppermint    lozenges, and upon these she would nibble in meeting whenever she    felt that feeling of goneness in the pit of her stomach, which I was    told old ladies sometimes suffer with. It was proper enough, I was    assured, for old ladies to nibble at crackers and peppermint    lozenges in meeting, but that such a proceeding would be very wicked    for a little boy.\"    From which it might appear that the atmosphere of Newfane, under the  grave and serious deportment of his grandmother, must have been a  change from the freedom Eugene and his brother enjoyed under the fond  rule of Miss French at Amherst. But when I was in Newfane in 1899 I was  informed by a dear old lady in bombazine, who remembered their visits  distinctly, that \"Eugene and Roswell were wild boys. Not bad, but just"]]]
