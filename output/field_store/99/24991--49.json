Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political  and military upheavals during more than 17 years of war, including the  nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February  1989). During the war one-third of the population fled the country,  with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6  million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan refugees remain  in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1 million have  probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Gross  domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 17 years  because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade  and transport. Millions of people continue to suffer from insufficient  food, clothing, housing, and medical care.

She took her money  to Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. She wanted some supplies ordered before she went  home, because, as she gravely said, \"the rheumatiz would get all the  money she had left when she got home,\"--meaning that her grandparents  would spend what remained for medicine.    The poor old grandparents read all the time of wonderful cures that  different dopes accomplish, and they spend every nickel they can get  their hands on for nostrums. They try everything they read of, and have  to buy it by the case,--horrid patent stuff! They have rolls of  testimonials and believe every word, so they keep on trying and hoping.  When there is any money they each order whatever medicine they want to  try. If Mrs. Edmonson's doesn't seem to help her, Grandpa takes it and  she takes his,--that is their idea of economy. They would spend hours  telling you about their different remedies and would offer you spoonful  after spoonful of vile-looking liquid, and be mildly grieved when you  refused to take it. Grandma's hands are so bent and twisted that she  can't sew, so dear old Grandpa tries to do it.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy told me that she helped out when she could. Three  years ago she made them all a complete outfit, but the \"rheumatiz\" has  been getting all the spare money since then, so there has been nothing  to sew. A peddler sold them a piece of gingham which they made up for  Cora Belle. It was broad pink and white stripes, and they wanted some  style to \"Cory's\" clothes, so they cut a gored skirt. But they had no  pattern and made the gores by folding a width of the goods biasly and  cutting it that way. It was put together with no regard to matching the  stripes, and a bias seam came in the center behind, but they put no  stay in the seam and the result was the most outrageous affair  imaginable.    Well, we had a large room almost empty and Mr. Stewart liked the idea  of a party, so Mrs. Louderer, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, and myself planned  for the event. It was to be a sewing-bee, a few good neighbors invited,  and all to sew for Grandma.... So Mrs. O'Shaughnessy went to Grandma's  and got all the material she had to make up. I had saved some  sugar-bags and some flour-bags. I knew Cora Belle needed underwear, so  I made her some little petticoats of the larger bags and some drawers  of the smaller. I had a small piece of white lawn that I had no use  for, and of that I made a dear little sunbonnet with a narrow edging of  lace around, and also made a gingham bonnet for her. Two days before  the time, came Mrs. Louderer, laden with bundles, and Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy, also laden. We had all been thinking of Cora Belle. Mr.  Stewart had sent by mail for her a pair of sandals for everyday wear  and a nice pair of shoes, also some stockings. Mrs. Louderer brought  cloth for three dresses of heavy Dutch calico, and gingham for three  aprons. She made them herself and she sews so carefully. She had bought  patterns and the little dresses were stylishly made, as well as well  made. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy brought a piece of crossbar with a tiny  forget-me-not polka dot, and also had goods and embroidery for a suit  of underwear. My own poor efforts were already completed when the rest  came, so I was free to help them.    Late in the afternoon of the 29th a funny something showed up. Fancy a  squeaky, rickety old wagon without a vestige of paint. The tires had  come off and had been \"set\" at home; that is done by heating the tires  red-hot and having the rims of the wheels covered with several layers  of burlap, or other old rags, well wet; then the red-hot tire is put on  and water hurriedly poured on to shrink the iron and to keep the burlap  from blazing. Well, whoever had set Cora Belle's tires had forgotten to  cut away the surplus burlap, so all the ragtags were merrily waving in  the breeze.    Cora Belle's team would bring a smile to the soberest face alive. Sheba  is a tall, lanky old mare. Once she was bay in color, but the years  have added gray hair until now she is roan. Being so long-legged she  strides along at an amazing pace which her mate, Balaam, a little  donkey, finds it hard to keep up with. Balaam, like Sheba, is full of  years. Once his glossy brown coat was the pride of some Mexican's  heart, but time has added to his color also, and now he is blue. His  eyes are sunken and dim, his ears no longer stand up in true donkey  style, but droop dejectedly. He has to trot his best to keep up with  Sheba's slowest stride. About every three miles he balks, but little  Cora Belle doesn't call it balking, she says Balaam has stopped to  rest, and they sit and wait till he is ready to trot along again. That  is the kind of layout which drew up before our door that evening. Cora  Belle was driving and she wore her wonderful pink dress which hung  down in a peak behind, fully six inches longer than anywhere else. The  poor child had no shoes. The winter had tried the last pair to their  utmost endurance and the \"rheumatiz\" had long since got the last  dollar, so she came with her chubby little sunburned legs bare. Her  poor little scarred feet were clean, her toe-nails full of nicks almost  into the quick, broken against rocks when she had been herding her  sheep. In the back of the wagon, flat on the bottom, sat Grandma and  Grandpa, such bundles of coats and blankets I can't describe. After a  great deal of trouble we got them unloaded and into the house. Then  Mrs. Louderer entertained them while Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and I prepared  supper and got a bath ready for Cora Belle. We had a T-bone steak,  mashed potatoes, hominy, hot biscuits and butter, and stewed prunes.  Their long ride had made them hungry and I know they enjoyed their  meal.    After supper Cora Belle and I washed the dishes while Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy laid out the little clothes. Cora Belle's clothes were to  be a surprise. The postmistress here also keeps a small store and has  ribbon, and when she heard of our plans from Mr. Stewart she sent up a  couple of pairs of hair-ribbon for Cora Belle. Soon Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  called us, and Cora Belle and I went into the bedroom where she was. I  wish you could have seen that child! Poor little neglected thing, she  began to cry. She said, \"They ain't for me, I know they ain't. Why, it  ain't my birthday, it's Granny's.\" Nevertheless, she had her arms full  of them and was clutching them so tightly with her work-worn little  hands that we couldn't get them. She sobbed so deeply that Grandma  heard her and became alarmed. She hobbled to the door and pounded with  her poor twisted hands, calling all the while, \"Cory, Cory Belle, what  ails you?\" She got so excited that I opened the door, but Cora Belle  told her to go away. She said, \"They ain't for you, Granny, and they  ain't for me either.\" ...    People here observe Decoration Day faithfully, and Cora Belle had  brought half a wagon-load of iris, which grows wild here. Next morning  we were all up early, but Cora Belle's flowers had wilted and she had  to gather more, but we all hurried and helped. She said as she was  going to see her mother she wanted to wear her prettiest dress, so Gale  and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy helped her to get ready. The cemetery is only  about two miles away, so we were all down quite early. We were obliged  to hurry because others were coming to help sew. Cora Belle went at  once to the graves where her parents lie side by side, and began  talking to her mother just as though she saw her. \"You didn't know me,  did you, Mother, with my pretty new things? But I am your little girl,  Mamma. I am your little Cora Belle.\" After she had talked and had  turned every way like a proud little bird, she went to work. And, oh,  how fast she worked! Both graves were first completely covered with  pine boughs. It looked like sod, so closely were the little twigs laid.  Next she broke the stems off the iris and scattered the blossoms over,  and the effect was very beautiful. Then we hurried home and everybody  got busy. The men took Grandpa off to another part of the ranch where  they were fanning oats to plant, and kept him all day. That was good  for him because then he could be with the men all day and he so seldom  has a chance to be with men. Several ladies came and they all made  themselves at home and worked like beavers, and we all had a fine  time....    Sedalia was present and almost caused a riot. She says she likes  unusual words because they lend distinction to conversation. Well, they  do--sometimes. There was another lady present whose children are very  gifted musically, but who have the bad name of taking what they want  without asking. The mother can neither read nor write, and she is very  sensitive about the bad name her children have. While we were all busy  some one made a remark about how smart these children were. Sedalia  thought that a good time to get in a big word, so she said, \"Yes, I  have always said Lula was a progeny.\" Mrs. Hall didn't know what she  meant and thought that she was casting reflections on her child's  honesty, so with her face scarlet and her eyes blazing she said,  \"Sedalia Lane, I won't allow you nor nobody else to say my child is a  progeny. You can take that back or I will slap you peaked.\" Sedalia  took it back in a hurry, so I guess little Lula Hall is not a progeny.    Every one left about four except Gale, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, Mrs.  Louderer, and the Edmonsons. They had farthest to go, so they stayed  over night again. We worked until ten o'clock that night over Grandma's  clothes, but everything was thoroughly finished. Every button was on,  every thread-end knotted and clipped, and some tired workers lay down  to rest, as did a very happy child and a very thankful old lady.    Every one got away by ten o'clock the next morning. The last I saw of  little Cora Belle was when they had reached the top of a"]]]
