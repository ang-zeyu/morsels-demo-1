God is very good to me, His blessings are unnumbered!\"    \"It seems a sad sort of bridal for you,\" he said, \"but I shall telegraph  the hour to mamma immediately, and they will all be thinking of and  praying for you.\"    \"Oh, that is a comfort I had not thought of!\" she exclaimed, with glad  tears shining in her eyes. \"What a blessing you are to me, brother dear!\"    Lester was not able to leave his bed or likely to be for weeks, but that  she might devote herself the more entirely to him Elsie had consented to  be married at once.    She laid aside her mourning for the occasion, and Dinah helped her to  array herself for her bridal in a very beautiful evening dress of some  white material which had been worn but once before.    \"Pity dars no time to get a new dress, Miss Elsie,\" remarked the  handmaiden half regretfully. \"Doe sho' nuff you couldn't look no sweeter  and beautifuller dan you does in dis.\"    \"I prefer this, Dinah, because they all--even dear, dear papa--have seen  me in it,\" Elsie said, hastily wiping away a tear; \"and I remember he said  it became me well. Oh, I can see his proud, fond smile as he said it, and  almost feel the touch of his lips; for he bent down and kissed me so  tenderly.\"    \"Miss Elsie, I jes b'lieves he's a lookin' at you now dis bressed minute,  and ef de res' of dose dat lubs you is far away he'll be sho to stan'  close side o' you when de ministah's a saying de words dat'll make you  Massa Leland's wife.\"    \"Ah, Dinah, what a sweet thought! and who shall say it may not be so!\"    \"Dar's Massa Edward!\" exclaimed Dinah, as a quick, manly step was heard,  followed by a light rap upon the door.    She hastened to open it \"We's ready, Marse Ed'ard.\"    He did not seem to hear or heed her; his eyes were fastened upon his  beautiful sister, more beautiful at this moment, he thought, than ever  before.    \"Elsie!\" he cried. \"Oh that mamma could see you! she herself could hardly  have been a lovelier bride! yet these are wanted to complete your attire,\"  opening a box he had brought, and taking therefrom a veil of exquisite  texture and design and a wreath of orange blossoms.    \"How kind and thoughtful, Edward!\" she said, thanking him with a sweet  though tearful smile; \"but are they suitable for such a bridal as this?\"    \"Surely,\" he said. \"Come, Dinah, and help me to arrange them.\"    Their labors finished, he stepped back a little to note the effect.    \"O darling sister,\" he exclaimed, \"never, I am sure, was there a lovelier  bride! I wish the whole world could see you!\"    \"Our own little world at Ion is all I should ask for,\" she responded in  tremulous tones.    \"Yes, it must be very hard for you,\" he said; \"especially not to have  mamma here, you who have always clung to her so closely. Such a different  wedding as it is from hers! But it's very romantic you know,\" he added  jocosely, trying to raise her drooping spirits.    \"Ah, I am forgetting a piece of news I have to tell I met an American  gentleman and his daughter, the other day, fell into conversation with  him, and learned that we have several common acquaintances I think we were  mutually pleased, and I have asked him and his daughter in to the wedding;  thinking it would not be unpleasant to you, and we should thus have two  more witnesses.\"    \"Perhaps it is best we should,\" she returned, in her sweet, gentle way,  yet looking somewhat disturbed.    \"I'm afraid I ought to have consulted you first,\" he said. \"I'm sorry, but  it is too late now His name is Love; his daughter--an extremely pretty  girl by the way--he calls Zoe.\"    Ben now came to the door to say that all was in readiness--the minister,  the doctor, and the other gentleman and a lady had arrived.    Edward gave his arm to his sister and led her into the room, to which  Lester had been carried a few moments before, and where he lay on a  luxurious couch, propped up with pillows into a half-sitting posture.    A touch of color came into his pale cheeks, and his eyes shone with love  and joy as they rested upon his lovely bride, as Edward led her to the  side of his couch.    Dinah and Ben followed, taking their places near the door and watching the  proceedings with interest and sympathy.    The minister stood up, the doctor, the stranger guests, the nurse also,  and the ceremony began.    Elsie's eyes were full of tears, but her sweet low tones were distinct and  clear as she took the marriage vows.    So were Lester's; his voice seemed stronger than it had been for weeks,  and when he took the small white-gloved hand in his, the grasp was firm as  well as tender.    \"One kiss, my love, my wife!\" he pleaded when the ceremony was ended.    A soft blush suffused the fair face and neck, but the request was  granted; she bent over him and for an instant their lips met.    Then Edward embraced her with brotherly affection and good wishes. He  grasped Lester's hand in cordial greeting, then turned and introduced his  new-made friends to the bride and groom.    A table loaded with delicacies stood in an adjoining room, and thither the  brother and sister and their guests now repaired, while for a short season  the invalid was left to quietness and repose that he might recover from  the unwonted excitement and fatigue.          CHAPTER VII.        \"Therein he them fall fair did entertain,       Not with such forged shows as fitter been       For courting fools, that courtesies would faine,       But with entire affection plain.\"            --_Spenser's \"Fairy Queen.\"_      One bright morning in November the Ion family were gathered about the  breakfast-table. Rosie and Walter were there for the first time since  their severe illness, a trifle pale and thin still, but nearly in usual  health, and very glad to be permitted to take their old places at the  table.    Mrs. Dinsmore had returned from her sojourn at the Laurels, the home of  her daughter Rose; the grandchildren there, whom she had been nursing,  having also recovered their health; and so the places of the eldest son  and daughter of the house were the only vacant ones.    Both Elsie and Edward were sorely missed, especially by the mother and  Violet.    \"It seems time we had letters again from our absentees, papa,\" Mrs.  Travilla remarked as she poured the coffee. \"We have had none since the  telegram giving the hour for the wedding.\"    \"No, but perhaps we may hear this morning--the mail has not come yet.\"    \"Yes, grandpa; here comes Solon with it,\" said Harold, glancing from the  window.    In a few moments the man came in bringing the mail-bag, which he handed to  Mr. Dinsmore.    All looked on with interest, the younger ones in eager expectation, while  their grandfather opened it and examined the contents.    \"Yes, daughter, there is a letter from each of them, both directed to  you,\" he said, glancing over the addresses on several letters which he now  held in his hand. \"Here, Tom,\" to the servant in waiting, \"take these to  your mistress. Don't read them to the neglecting of your breakfast,\" he  added with a smile, again addressing Mrs. Travilla.    \"No, sir; they will keep,\" she answered, returning the smile; \"and you  shall all share the pleasure of their perusal with me after prayers.  Doubtless they give the particulars we all want so much to learn.\"    They all gathered round her at the appointed time. She held the letters  open in her hand, having already given them a cursory examination lest  there should be some little confidence intended for none but \"mother's\"  eye.    \"Papa,\" she said, looking up half tearfully, half smilingly at him as he  stood at her side, \"the deed is indeed done, and another claims my  first-born darling as his own.\"    \"You have not lost her, Elsie dearest, but have gained a son; and I trust  we shall have them both with us ere long,\" he responded, bending down to  touch his lips to the brow still as smooth and fair as in the days of her  girlhood.    \"Poor dear Elsie! how she must have missed and longed for you, dearest  mamma!\" Violet sighed, kneeling close to her mother's chair and putting  her arms around her.    \"What is it? all about Elsie's wedding?\" asked Herbert. \"Please let us  hear it, mamma. The telegram told nothing but the hour when it was to be,  and I was so surprised, for I never understood that that was what she went  away for.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Harold; \"though I suppose it was very stupid in us not to  understand.\"    \"Who did get married with my sister Elsie, mamma?\" asked little Walter.    \"Mr. Leland, my son.\"    \"But I thought he was most dead,\" remarked Rosie in surprise.    \"He has been very ill,\" her mother said, \"but is improving fast, though  not yet able to sit up.\"    Rosie, opening her eyes wide in astonishment, was beginning another  question when Harold stopped her.    \"Wait, Rosie, don't you see mamma is going to read the letters? They will  tell us all about it, I presume.\"    \"I shall read Edward's first, it gives a very minute account of what they  have done since he wrote us last, just after their arrival in Rome,\" the  mother said. \"He is a good boy to take the trouble to tell us everything  in detail; is he not, papa?\"    \"Yes,\" Mr. Dinsmore assented, seating himself by her side and taking Rosie  upon one knee, Walter on the other; \"and so good a mother richly deserves  good, thoughtful sons and daughters, ever ready to do all in their power  to promote her happiness, or afford her pleasure. Does she not, children?\"    \"Yes, grandpa, indeed she does!\" they replied in chorus.    Her sweet soft eyes glistened with happy tears as she sent a loving glance  round the little circle; then all becoming perfectly quiet and attentive,  she began to read.    Edward's first item of news was that the marriage had just taken place;  the next that Lester's health was steadily improving. Then came a  description of the rooms they were occupying; both as they were when first  seen by Elsie and himself and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#9)"],[1,"    The kitten went back to the empty saucer, and sniffed at it, then with a  funny little hop and jump, it came back and rubbed, purring, against the  old man's leg, but it kept a sharp watch on the big dog.    \"We'll call it Hippity-Hop,\" decided Captain Smith, and as neither the  kitten nor Jan suggested a better name, that settled it.    Hippity-Hop was really quite a nice little kitten, even if she did not  have as many legs as most cats have. Her fur was dark grey, a white  breast and ring around her neck looked as though she had put on a clean  shirt and collar, while every one of her three paws was snow-white, like  nice white gloves. She spent a great deal of her time washing her fur  with her tongue.    For many days Hippity-Hop was afraid of Jan, who was big enough to  swallow her at one gulp; but when she learned that he stood back and let  her eat first from his dish, although she had just cleaned her own  plate, she lost her fear and grew to love him. Each night after supper  she crawled between his paws and went to sleep, while he lay very  still, that he might not waken his little friend.    Jan was very sure that Hippity-Hop was the nicest little kitten in the  world, after she had learned one thing:    When first she went to live with the captain and Jan and had seen  Cheepsie walking around on the floor, Hippity-Hop's green eyes  glistened. Then her claws reached out from the fur that hid them and her  tail twitched and jerked as she crouched to spring on the little yellow  bird that was paying no attention to the kitten. But, just as she was  ready to jump, there was a terrible roar behind her and she was grabbed  by Jan's big jaws.    Hippity-Hop gave a yowl of fear, and twisted to scratch Jan's eyes, but  he gripped her firmly, though his teeth did not hurt her. Captain Smith,  hearing the commotion ran into the room and understood at once what had  happened. He took the kitten from Jan, and though Hippity-Hop spit and  scratched and yowled, the old man dipped her several times in a tub of  water. Cats hate water, and Hippity-Hop hated water more than most  cats, for it made her think of the time she had been almost drowned in  the ocean.    \"You've got to learn to be kind to Cheepsie, or else you can't live here  with us,\" the old man said as he set the kitten on the porch floor.    The kitten began to lick her wet fur, but she was badly frightened and  very sure that if Jan did not eat her up, the captain would put her back  in the ocean again. So she resolved never to bother Cheepsie after that  one time.    The bird seemed to understand, too, for it was not long after this that  Hippity-Hop, Jan and Cheepsie ate out of the same dish. At times the  bird would perch on the dog's head and sing to them all. Jan always sat  as still as he could, until the song ended and Cheepsie had flown over  to the captain's shoulder. Often the old man took his violin from the  corner, and as he played he whistled or sang in a quavering voice, Jan's  tail beat time on the floor, Hippity-Hop joined with a song of her own,  though it was only a loud purr, while Cheepsie, perched on their loved  master's shoulder, sang and trilled as loudly as he could, trying to  make more music than the bird that lived in the violin.    \"It's a fine old world, Jan!\" the poundmaster would say, as he put the  violin away in its box.    Then Hippity-Hop and Jan knew it was time for bed, and Cheepsie hurried  to his cage and tucked his little head under his yellow wing.          Chapter VIII    THE MUZZLE      Jan's curiosity about the dogs that disappeared was satisfied when a  lady in a handsome gown was driven to the bungalow one evening.    Captain Smith met her with a happy smile, then he brought in an Airedale  dog that had been with the other dogs for many weeks. The lady patted  the dog, spoke to it gently, then she rose from her chair and the  captain followed her to the gate where an automobile was waiting. The  Airedale was lifted into the seat beside her.    \"He will have the kindest care,\" she leaned forward to say, \"and I hope  you will be able to find homes for all the other dogs, too. I will tell  my friends about them. Captain Smith, does the city pay for their feed  while you find homes for them all?\"    Jan saw his master slowly shake his head, \"It does not take much to feed  them,\" he answered. \"I am allowed to feed them a week, but I manage the  rest of it from my salary. It makes me happy to see their gratitude, for  most of them have been cuffed about so they don't know that there are  people who will be kind and love them.\"    After the visitor left, Jan lay quietly watching the old man moving  about the room. Now, he understood everything, and the dog rose quickly  and thrust his nose into the wrinkled hand. The smile on the old man's  face went deep into Jan's heart as the poundmaster, lifting the dog's  head, looked into Jan's eyes, saying, \"It's a pretty hard thing when any  human being is without a friend, Jan; but people can speak up for  themselves. A dog can't do that, and yet, he is the best friend any man  can have.\"    So Jan always felt happy after that day, for when he missed one of the  dogs now, he knew it had found a home and some one to love it. And on  those days the poundmaster went around with shining eyes while his lips  puckered up in a cheerful whistle, or Jan heard him singing:'        \"Old dog Tray is ever faithful,        Grief cannot drive him away;      He's gentle and he's kind      And you'll never, never find        A better friend than old dog Tray.\"    Many times when friends called to talk and smoke with the Captain, Jan  would go for a short walk along the beach. One evening the ocean looked  so inviting that the dog could not resist swimming far out, barking and  snapping at floating kelp. It was much later than usual when he reached  the shore and shook his long fur until it showered the salt water like a  rain storm, then with a loud \"Woof!\" of happiness, he ran toward his  home.    The high cliffs that rose above the beach threw dark shadows on the  sand. The little bungalow where the captain lived was at the top of this  cliff overlooking the ocean. The pound was not far away, and there were  several other bungalows a little distance apart from each other, and a  flight of wooden steps edged a twisting footpath which led directly up  to the front gate of Jan's home.    It was easier to scamper up the pathway than climb the wooden steps, and  the dog hurried to reach the top; but a slight noise made him pause and  look at the thick brush near him. There was nothing to be seen, but  Jan's ears listened sharply while his sensitive nose sniffed the air  suspiciously. One sniff was enough to make the hair bristle along his  back. William, his old enemy, was near.    Jan whirled quickly, his eyes shining with fury and hate, and his hair  formed a stiff ridge along his back while his teeth gleamed in a snarl.  Something slipped over his head and despite his struggles, it twisted  tightly around his neck. A strange odor made him sick and weak when he  tried to breathe. His paws clawed in his attempts to tear the sack from  his head, so that he could breathe and fight, but his legs grew limp, a  noise sounded inside his ears, something seemed to be hammering at the  top of his head. He made one more effort, staggered a few steps, then  crumpled down on the sand. But he knew it was William's boot that kicked  him, and William's voice that said, \"Guess that will settle you.\" Jan  tried to growl but he was too sick to make a sound.    The next thing he knew was when he woke in a strange dark place. His  whole body was stiff and sore, he felt sick all over and something hurt  his nose terribly. His paws clawed at the thing that hurt. It was made  of wire that cut deeply in his flesh. He knew it was a muzzle, for he  had seen other dogs suffer from them. The more he clawed, the worse it  hurt.    Then he rubbed his head sideways on the floor, but this made matters  worse, so he gave up fighting and lay with his nose against the floor  until he could stand the pain no longer. When he staggered to his feet,  he found a rope held him, but when he tried to chew the rope the muzzle  kept his jaws closed so that he was barely able to thrust the tip of his  swollen tongue between his front teeth.    Jan suffered torture, not only because the wire cut his flesh, but also  because any dog, when frightened, sick, or too hot, becomes feverish and  his tongue hangs from his mouth. That is the way a dog sweats, and  Prince Jan's mouth was clamped together by the muzzle. He could not hear  any noise in the room, so he lay down and kept very quiet. There was  really nothing else he could do, except howl. He knew that William had  something to do with all this trouble, and he hated William more than  ever.    A door opened. Jan sprang to his feet, hoping he might be able to break  the rope and escape before the door was closed. He crouched and leaped  with all his strength, but the rope was too strong and he fell with a  thud to the floor, where he panted heavily. A flash of light almost  blinded him, but he saw William and snarled defiance. Another man was in  the room. Jan caught a glimpse of him, gave a sniff, and knew that this  other man was the one who had been with William in the Pixley stable. He  felt that he had two enemies now to fight.    As William came toward the dog, Jan strained on the rope.    \"You'll get that temper taken out of you before long,\" threatened the  man, at the same time keeping carefully beyond the length of the rope.  But William's hatred outbalanced his caution, and he lifted his foot to  give the dog a kick. Jan shrank back, not from fear as William supposed,  but to get a better chance to spring and grab the man's leg.    \"Let him alone,\" called the other man. \"The worse you treat that dog the  harder it will be to handle him.\"    William scowled. \"The"]]]
