He was distinctly visible, from the strong and vivid phosphorescence  excited by his rapid motion through the sleeping waters of the dark  creek, which lit up his jaws, and head, and whole body; his eyes were  especially luminous, while a long wake of sparkles streamed away astern  of him from the lashing of his tail. As the boats lost their speed,  the luminousness of his appearance faded gradually as he shortened  sail also, until he disappeared altogether. He was then at rest, and  suspended motionless in the water; and the only thing that indicated  his proximity, was an occasional sparkle from the motion of a fin. We  brought the boats nearer together, after pulling a stroke or two, but he  seemed to sink as we closed, until at last we could merely distinguish  an indistinct halo far down in the clear black profound. But as we  separated, and resumed our original position, he again rose near the  surface; and although the ripple and dip of the oars rendered him  invisible while we were pulling, yet the moment we again rested on them,  there was the monster, like a persecuting fiend, once more right between  us, glaring on us, and apparently watching every motion. It was a  terrible spectacle, and rendered still more striking by the melancholy  occurrence of the forenoon. \"That's the very identical, damnable  _baste_ himself, as murthered poor little Louis this morning, yeer  honour; I knows him from the torn flesh of him under his larboard  blinker, sir--just where Wiggen's boat hook punished him,\" quoth the  Irish captain of the mizzen-top.    \"A water-kelpie,\" murmured another of the Captain's gigs, a Scotchman.    The men were evidently alarmed, \"Stretch out, men: never mind the shark.  He can't jump into the boat surely,\" said the skipper. \"What the deuce  are you afraid of?\"    We arrived within pistol-shot of the ship.    As we approached, the sentry hailed, \"Boat, ahoy!\"    \"Firebrand,\" sung out the skipper, in reply.    \"Man the side--gangway lanterns there,\" quoth the officer on duty; and  by the time we were close to, there were two sidesmen over the side with  the manropes ready stuck out to our grasp, and two boys with lanterns  above them. We got on deck.

Nor was the opinion which  Apollodorus gave with respect to the plans of a sumptuous temple of  Venus forgotten: viz.--upon seeing the statues sitting, as they were,  in the temple (which, it seems, wanted much of its due proportion in  height), he said, \"if the goddesses should ever attempt to stand upon  their feet, they would assuredly break their heads against the ceiling.\"  Adrian, meanly jealous and inexcusably revengeful, banished the  architect, and having caused him to be accused of various crimes, put  him to death.

They were naturally filled with curiosity  to ascertain who and what the trio were. One was a lord, another a sir, and  the third a surgeon; and this was all that was known to any one.    \"Have we really a live lord on board, Felix?\" asked Mrs. Blossom, as they  were waiting for breakfast in the music-room.    \"He is not a dead one, sure,\" replied the Milesian, \"though he would soon  have been a very dead one if we had not happened along when we did.\"    \"One of them was a colored man,\" added the good lady.    \"Sir Modava Rao!\" exclaimed Felix. \"He is not more than a shade darker than  you are, Aunty; and he is a great man in the country we visit next. But dry  up; the captain is going to say something.\"    The commander gave the names of the three distinguished persons who were  then in the cabin. It was very nearly breakfast-time, and the trio had had  abundant time to dress themselves in the garments provided for them, and he  requested all the party to descend to the cabin, leading the way himself.  They found the rescued party seated on the divans between the doors of the  state-rooms, and they all rose to their feet as soon as the commander  appeared.    They presented an entirely different appearance from what they did in their  drabbled garments; for those who had supplied them with clothing had  brought out their best clothes, and the three gentlemen seemed to be in  condition to go to church. Lord Tremlyn hastened to the captain with  extended hand as he stepped down upon the floor of the cabin.    \"I desire to express my gratitude anew to you, and to the gentlemen who  have made us capable of coming into your presence in proper condition,\"  said his lordship, as the commander took his offered hand, which was wrung  with the utmost cordiality.    \"So far as I am concerned, my Lord, I have done nothing but my duty; for I  am a sailor, and the true son of the ocean is always ready to sacrifice  even his life to save a shipwrecked brother of the sea,\" replied the  captain.    \"Then you are a true son of the ocean, Captain Ringgold, and I shall  remember you as long as I live in my prayers!\"    \"So shall we all!\" exclaimed Sir Modava, taking the hand of the commander.    \"I indorse the sentiment,\" added Dr. Ferrolan.    \"In regard to the clothing,\" said the commander, as he threw back his head,  elevated his shoulders, and spread out his arms, so as to exhibit to its  full extent the height and breadth of his stalwart form, \"I was,  unfortunately, unable to contribute to the supply of garments for your  party; for mine on any one of you would have been like a shirt on a  handspike.\"    \"But a London tailor could hardly have fitted us any better,\" replied the  spokesman of the trio.    \"I am happy to see you in such excellent condition so soon after the  disaster. With your permission, gentlemen, I desire to introduce you to  each of my passengers, promising to indicate those whose garments you  wear,\" continued the commander.    \"With the greatest pleasure,\" replied Lord Tremlyn; and the other two bowed  their acquiescence.    \"This, gentlemen, is Mr. Belgrave, the owner of the Guardian-Mother, the  steam-yacht in which he is making a voyage round the world.\"    \"I am extremely pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Belgrave,\" added  Lord Tremlyn, as he took the hand of the young millionaire. \"We owe our  lives to the fortunate presence of your magnificent steam-yacht in this  part of the Arabian Sea. Permit me to present to you Prince Modava, who has  been knighted for his distinguished services to the British Crown, and who  prefers to be known by his English title.\"    \"That's your colored man!\" whispered Felix to Mrs. Blossom.    \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the motherly lady. \"A live prince!\"    \"It affords me very great pleasure to become acquainted with you, Mr.  Belgrave,\" with a smile so sweet and expressive that it ravished the hearts  of the ladies. \"I am under a burden of obligation to you which I shall  never be able to repay; and I hope I shall be able to render you some  slight service in assisting you to see India, for I learn that you are  bound to Bombay.\"    \"I thank you, Sir Modava; and we shall gratefully accept any favors you may  extend to us.\"    \"Let me add, my Lord, that Mr. Belgrave pulled the stroke oar in the boat  which picked you up after you had sent our first cutter to the relief of  Sir Modava,\" interposed the commander.    \"Then I shall have an additional reason to remember with gratitude the  young gentleman,\" added Lord Tremlyn.    \"Mrs. Belgrave, gentlemen, the mother of our owner,\" the captain proceeded,  as he took the lady by the arm.    \"I congratulate you, madam, on being the mother of such a noble son; for  not many young men with the fortune he has at his command would pull an oar  in such a gale, such a storm, even to save his fellow-beings from perishing  in the angry waves,\" said his lordship, as he took the hand of the lady.  \"Blessed be the mother of such a boy!\"    The members of the Woolridge family were next presented to the trio; and  the distinguished strangers had something pleasant to say to each of them.  The \"live lord\" was only twenty-eight years old, and Sir Modava but thirty,  while Dr. Ferrolan was forty-six; and all of them seemed to be greatly  impressed, and even startled, when Miss Blanche dawned upon them; for she  was as beautiful to them as she was to everybody else, and they seemed to  be unwilling to allow her to make room for the others to be introduced.    Every person in the cabin seemed to enter into the spirit of the occasion;  and the wearers of the borrowed clothing, as the owners of the garments  were indicated, brought forth many humorous remarks from both sides, which  it would be pleasant to report if space permitted. The ceremony was  finished in due time, though it was rather a long time.    \"We are not accustomed to the companionship of titled personages,\" said the  commander at its conclusion. \"But we are eminently a social party, and we  desire our guests to make themselves as much at home on board of the  Guardian-Mother as if they owned her, and were running her for their own  pleasure.\"    \"Thank you, Captain Ringgold. Titles are not men, and we know that you are  all republicans. If we do not make ourselves worthy of the generous welcome  you have extended to us, we shall not ask any consideration on account  of the titles that have fallen upon us through the nature of our  constitutional government. I believe that we all stand on the same level  before our Maker; and whatever social distinctions prevail in our country,  they do not exempt any Briton from being a gentleman and an honest man,\"  replied Lord Tremlyn. And his remarks were warmly applauded by both English  and Americans; and the gentleman bowed his thanks for this appreciation of  his sentiments.    At a nod from the captain the bell was rung for breakfast. Taking the \"live  lord\" by the arm, he conducted him to the seat next him on his right. Louis  conducted Sir Modava to the place on the commander's left, and placed his  mother next to him. It was found impracticable to heed the names that had  been placed on the plates, for it would have taken too much time. Louis  took Miss Blanche to the place next to his mother, and seated himself at  her right.    Dr. Hawkes took possession of Dr. Ferrolan, and placed himself and Uncle  Moses on each side of him. The professor took charge of Mrs. Blossom. The  captain invited those who remained standing to take such seats as they  chose; and when all were placed at the table, he reverently said a brief  grace. Everybody was unusually social; but as the commander had announced  that the particulars of the wreck of the Travancore would be detailed in  due time by Dr. Ferrolan, the subject was ignored, and the voyage of the  Guardian-Mother was the general subject of conversation. The chief steward  had \"spread himself\" on the breakfast, and the meal was far more elaborate  than usual; and the wrecked trio proved that they had excellent appetites.                                           CHAPTER VII                        DR. FERROLAN'S EXPLANATION OF THE WRECK      With the rising of the sun the gale had broken, and by the time the party  in the cabin left the table, the north-east monsoon was soothing the ocean  with its gentle blast. The angry sea was rapidly becoming good-natured  again, though the waves were still high enough to give the ship an uneasy  motion. But all the party, and no less the trio added to their number, had  their sea-legs on, and no reasonable motion disturbed any of them.    The two engineers from the wreck of the Travancore had been as carefully  looked after as the strangers in the main cabin. They had been supplied  with clothing, and they had breakfasted in the mess-room on the best the  larder afforded. The third person brought in by the second cutter was the  Hindu cook of the wrecked steamer; but he spoke English very well, and had  been otherwise Europeanized. He had been turned over to Baldy Bickling, the  second cook of the ship, who had clothed and fed him, and seemed to be  unable to do enough for him.    The three gentlemen in the cabin were as sociable as could be desired; and  though it was Sunday morning, the scene at the tables had been very  animated.    When the meal was finished, the guests at their own request were shown over  the ship; and they were not at all reserved in the expression of their  admiration at the elegance with which she had been fitted up, and not less  at the convenience of all the arrangements.    Lord Tremlyn was particularly interested in the educational feature of the  Guardian-Mother, as Captain Ringgold explained his pet scheme in the  library, or study, abaft the state-cabin, as it was called on the plan of  the vessel prepared by the gentleman for whom she had been built. The  guests looked at the titles of the books,"]]]
