The  wound incident at Aboukir must have given great amusement as well as  anxiety to those about him. Unquestionably the wound had the  appearance at first of being mortal, but the surgeon soon gave a  reassuring opinion, and after binding up the ugly cut he requested his  patient to remain below. But Nelson, as soon as he knew he was not  going to die, became bored with the inactivity and insisted on writing  a dispatch to the Admiralty. His secretary was too excited to carry  out his wishes, so he tackled it himself. But his suffering being  great and his mind in a condition of whirling confusion, he did not  get far beyond the beginning, which intimated that \"Almighty God had  blessed His Majesty's arms.\" The battle raged on. The _Orient_ was set  on fire and her destruction assured. When Nelson was informed of the  terrible catastrophe to the great French line-of-battle ship, he  demanded to be assisted to the deck, whereupon he gave instructions  that his only boat not destroyed was to be sent with the _Vanguard's_  first lieutenant to render assistance to the crew. He remained on deck  until the _Orient_ blew up, and was then urged to go to bed.    But sleep under the circumstances and in view of his own condition  would not come. All night long he was sending messages directing the  plan of battle the news of which was to enthral the civilized world.  Nelson himself was not satisfied. \"Not one of the French vessels would  have escaped,\" he said, \"if it had pleased God that he had not been  wounded.\" This was rather a slur on those who had given their best  blood and really won the battle. Notwithstanding the apparent egotism  of this outburst, there are sound reasons for believing that the  Admiral's inspiring influence was much discounted by his not being  able to remain on deck. The sight of his guiding, magnetic figure had  an amazing effect on his men, but I think it must be admitted that  Nelson's head was not in a condition at that time to be entirely  relied upon, and those in charge of the different ships put the  finishing touches to the victory that was won by the force of his  courage and commanding genius in the initial stages of the struggle.      II    Nelson was a true descendant of a race of men who had never faltered  in the traditional belief that the world should be governed and  dominated by the British. His King, his country, and particularly the  profession to which he belonged, were to him the supreme authorities  whose destiny it was to direct the affairs of the universe. With  unfailing comic seriousness, intermixed with occasional explosions of  bitter violence, he placed the French low down in the scale of the  human family. There was scarcely a sailor adjective that was not  applied to them. Carlyle, in later years, designated the voice of  France as \"a confused babblement from the gutters\" and \"scarcely  human\"; \"A country indeed with its head cut off\"; but this quotation  does not reach some of the picturesque heights of nautical language  that was invented by Nelson to describe his view of them. Both he and  many of his fellow-countrymen regarded the chosen chief on whom the  French nation had democratically placed an imperial crown as the  embodiment of a wild beast.    The great Admiral was always wholehearted in his declamation against  the French people and their leaders who are our present allies  fighting against that country which now is, and which Napoleon  predicted to his dying day would become, one of the most imperious,  inhuman foes to civilization. Nelson and his government at that time  thought it a merciful high policy of brotherhood to protect and  re-create Prussia out of the wreck to which Napoleon had reduced it;  the result being that the military spirit of Prussia has been a  growing, determined menace to the peace of the world and to the cause  of human liberty in every form since the downfall of the man who  warned us at the time from his exiled home on the rock of St. Helena  that our policy would ultimately reflect with a vengeance upon  ourselves, and involve the whole world in a great effort to save  itself from destruction. He foresaw that Prussia would inveigle and  bully the smaller German states into unification with herself, and,  having cunningly accomplished this, that her perfidy would proceed to  consolidate the united fabric into a formidable power which would  crush all others by its military superiority; this dream of universal  control of human life and affairs was at one time nearly realized.    The German Empire has bankrupted herself in men, necessaries of life,  and money. But that in no degree minimizes the disaster she has  wrought on those who have had to bleed at every pore to avoid  annihilation. The Allies, as well as the Central Powers, are no longer  going concerns. It will take generations to get back to the point at  which we started in 1914. But the tragic thought of all is the  enormous sacrifice of life, and the mental and physical wrecks that  have survived the savage, brutal struggle brought on a world that was,  and wished to remain, at peace, when in 1914 the Central Powers  arrogantly forced the pace which caused an alliance to be formed  quickly by their enemies to save them from the doom which Napoleon,  with his clear vision, had predicted would come.    It was fitting that Nelson should by every conceivable means adopt  methods of declamation against the French, if by doing so he thought  it would inspire the men whom he commanded with the same conquering  spirit he himself possessed. His country was at war with the French,  and he was merely one of the instruments appointed to defeat them, and  this may account for his ebullitions of hatred from time to time. I  have found, however, no record that would in any way show that it was  intended as surface policy, so it may be concluded that his dislike  was as deep-seated as it appeared. Nelson never seems to have shown  evidences of being a humbug by saying things which he did not believe.  He had a wholesome dislike of the French people and of Bonaparte, who  was their idol at that time. But neither he nor his government can be  credited with the faculty of being students of human life. He and they  believed that Paris was the centre of all that was corrupt and brutal.  Napoleon, on the other hand, had no real hatred of the British people,  but during his wars with their government his avowed opinion was that  \"all the ills, and all the scourges that afflict mankind, came from  London.\" Both were wrong in their conclusions. They simply did not  understand each other's point of view in the great upheaval that was  disturbing the world. The British were not only jealous and afraid of  Napoleon's genius and amazing rise to eminence--which they attributed  to his inordinate ambition to establish himself as the dominating  factor in the affairs of the universe--but they determined that his  power should not only not be acknowledged, but destroyed, and their  policy after twenty years of bitter war was completely accomplished.    The merits or demerits of British policy must always remain a matter  of controversy. It is too big a question to deal with here. Napoleon  said himself that \"Everything in the life of man is subject to  calculation; the good and evil must be equally balanced.\" Other true  sayings of his indicate that he, at any rate, _was_ a student of human  life, and knew how fickle fortune is under certain conditions.  \"Reprisals,\" he declared, \"are but a sad resource\"; and again, no  doubt dwelling on his own misfortunes, but with vivid truth all the  same, he declares that \"The allies gained by victory will turn against  you upon the bare whisper of our defeat.\"      III    After his victory on the Nile, Nelson fully expected to be created a  Viscount, and his claim was well supported by Hood, his old Admiral.  He was made Baron Nelson of the Nile, and given a pension of L2,000  per annum--a poor recompense for the great service he had rendered to  his country. But that was by no means the measure of the public  gratitude. He was acclaimed from every corner of Great Britain as the  national hero. The City of London presented him with a two hundred  guinea sword, and a vote of thanks to himself, officers and men. There  was much prayer and thanksgiving, and several women went as daft as  brushes over him. One said her heart was absolutely bursting with all  sorts of sensations. \"I am half mad,\" says she, and any one who reads  the letter will conclude that she understated her mental condition.  But of all the many letters received by Nelson none surpasses in  extravagance of adulation that written by Amy Lyon, the daughter of a  village blacksmith, born at Great Neston in Cheshire, in 1761, who had  come to London in the early part of 1780, fallen into evil ways and  given birth to a little girl. She was then left destitute and sank as  low as it is possible for a woman to do. She rose out of the depths  into which she had fallen by appearing as the Goddess of Health in the  exhibition of a James Graham. Sir Henry Featherstonehaugh took her  under his protection for close on twelve months, but owing to her  extravagance and faithlessness he turned her out when within a few  months of a second child, which was stillborn. The first was handed  over to her grandmother to take care of. Charles Greville, the second  son of the Earl of Warwick, then took her to live with him. She had  intimate relations with him while she was still Featherstonehaugh's  mistress, and he believed the child about to be born was his. At this  time Amy Lyon changed her name to Emily Hart. Greville went to work on  business lines. He struck a bargain that all her previous lovers were  to be dropped, and under this compact she lived with him in a  respectable manner for nearly four years. He gave her some education,  but she seems to have had natural"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#9)"],[1,"it shall have been  twice read. Nor is it usual for it to be opposed until then; but it may  be opposed and rejected at the first reading.    Sec.12. After a bill has been twice read, and fully debated and amended, it  is proposed to be read on a future day the third time. If the question  on ordering the bill to a third reading is not carried, the bill is  lost, unless revived by a vote of the house to reconsider. But if the  question to read the third time is carried, the bill is accordingly read  on a future day, and the question taken on its final passage.    Sec.13. When the final vote is to be taken, the speaker puts the question:  \"Shall the bill pass?\" If a majority of the members present vote in the  affirmative, (the speaker also voting,) the bill is passed; if a  majority vote in the negative, the bill is lost. Also if the ayes and  noes are equal, it is lost, because there is not a majority in its  favor. In a senate where a lieutenant-governor presides, not being  properly a member, he does not vote, except when the ayes and noes are  equal; in which case there is said to be a _tie_; and he determines the  question by his vote, which is called the _casting_ vote. In some  states, on the final passage of a bill, a bare majority of the members  present is not sufficient to pass it, in case any members are absent.  The constitutions of those states require the votes of a majority of  _all the members elected_ to each house.    Sec.14. When a bill has passed one house it is sent to the other, where it  must pass through the same forms of action; that is, it must be referred  to a committee; reported by the committee to the house; and be read  three times before a vote is taken on its passage. This vote having  been taken, the bill is returned to the house from which it was  received. If it has been amended, the amendments must be agreed to by  the first house, or the second must recede from their amendments, or the  amendments must be so modified as to secure the approval of both houses,  before the bill can become a law.    Sec.15. Some young reader may inquire why a bill should take so long and  slow a course through two different houses; and why one body of  representatives is not sufficient. The object is to secure the enactment  of good laws. Notwithstanding bills go through the hands of a committee  and three different readings in the house; yet through undue haste,  wrong information, or from other causes, a house may, and often does,  commit serious errors. Legislatures are therefore divided into two  branches; and a bill having passed one house is sent to the other where  the mistakes of the former may be corrected, or the bill wholly  rejected.    Sec.16. But in many of the states, a bill, when passed by both houses, is  not yet a law. As the two houses may concur in adopting an unwise  measure, an additional safeguard is provided against the enactment of  bad laws, by requiring all bills to be sent to the governor for  examination and approval. If he approves a bill, he signs it, and it is  a law; if he does not sign it, it is not a law. In refusing to sign a  bill, he is said to _negative_, or _veto_ the bill. _Veto_, Latin,  means, _I forbid_.    Sec.17. But no governor has full power to prevent the passage of a law. If  he does not approve a bill, he must return it to the house in which it  originated, stating his objections to it; and if it shall be again  passed by both houses, it will be a law without the governor's assent  But in such cases greater majorities are generally required to pass a  law. In some states, a majority of two-thirds of the members present is  necessary; in others, a majority of _all the members elected_. In a few  states, only the same majorities are required to pass a bill against  the veto as in the first instance. Or if the governor does not return a  bill within a certain number of days, it becomes a law without his  signature, or without being considered a second time. In some states,  bills are not sent to the governor, but are laws when passed by both  houses and signed by their presiding officers.          Chapter XII.    Executive Department. Governor and Lieutenant-Governor.        Sec.1. The chief executive power of a state is, by the constitution, vested  in a governor. The governor is chosen by the people at the general  election; in South Carolina by the legislature. The term of office is  not the same in all the states. In the six New England states, the  governors are chosen annually; in the other states, for the different  terms of two, three, and four years.    Sec.2. The qualifications for the office of governor are also different in  the different states. To be eligible to the office of governor, a person  must have been for a certain number of years a citizen of the United  States, and for a term of years preceding his election a resident of the  state. He must also be above a certain age, which, in a majority of the  states, is at least thirty years; and in some states he must be a  freeholder.    Sec.3. The powers and duties of a governor are numerous. He communicates by  message to the legislature, at every session, information of the  condition of the state of its affairs generally, and recommends such  measures as he judges necessary and expedient. He is to take care that  the laws be faithfully executed, and to transact all necessary business  with the officers of the government. He may convene the legislature on  extraordinary occasions: that is, if, at a time when the legislature is  not in session, a matter should arise requiring immediate attention, the  governor may call a special meeting of the legislature, or as it is  usually termed, an extra session.    Sec.4. A governor has power to grant reprieves and pardons, except in cases  of impeachment, and, in some states, of treason. To _reprieve_ is to  postpone or delay for a time the execution of the sentence of death upon  a criminal. To _pardon_ is to annul the sentence by forgiving the  offense and releasing the offender. A governor may also _commute_ a  sentence; which is to exchange one penalty or punishment for another of  less severity; as, when a person sentenced to suffer death, is ordered  to be imprisoned.    Sec.5. The governor has power also, in some of the states, with the consent  of the senate, to appoint the higher officers of the militia of the  state, and the higher civil officers in the executive and judicial  departments. In a few of the states, there are executive councils whose  advice and consent are required in such cases. In making such  appointments, the governor nominates, that is, he _names_ to the senate,  in writing, the persons to be appointed. If a majority of the senators  consent, the persons so nominated are appointed. Many other duties are  by the constitution devolved upon the governor.    Sec.6. A lieutenant-governor has few duties to perform. He presides in the  senate, in which he has only a casting vote. In the state of New York,  he serves in some of the boards of executive officers. In nearly  one-half of the states the office of lieutenant-governor does not exist.  The chief object of electing this officer seems to be to provide a  suitable person to fill the vacancy in the office of governor in case  the latter should die, resign, be removed, or otherwise become  incompetent.    Sec.7. When the lieutenant-governor acts as governor, the senate chooses  from its own number a president. If the offices of both the governor and  lieutenant-governor should become vacant, the president of the senate  must act as governor. If there should be neither a governor, a  lieutenant-governor, nor a president or speaker of the senate, then, the  speaker of the house of representatives would become the acting  governor. This is believed to be the rule for supplying vacancies in  most if not all of the states.          Chapter XIII.    Assistant Executive State Officers.        Sec.1. Among the executive officers who assist in the administration of the  government, there are in every state, some or all of the following: a  secretary of state, a controller or auditor, a treasurer, an  attorney-general, a surveyor-general. The mode of their appointment and  the terms of their respective offices, are prescribed by the  constitution or by law. In some states they are appointed by the  governor and senate; in others by the legislature; and in others they  are elected by the people. They keep their offices at the seat of  government of the state.    Sec.2. The _secretary of state_ keeps a record of the official acts and  proceedings of the legislature and of the executive departments, and has  the care of the books, records, deeds of the state, parchments, the laws  enacted by the legislature, and all other papers and documents required  by law to be kept in his office. He causes the laws passed by the  legislature to be published in one or more newspapers, as directed by  law; and also to be printed and bound in a volume, and distributed among  the state officers for their use, and among the county and town clerks,  to be kept in their offices for the use of the people who wish to  examine the laws. Also one or more copies are exchanged with each of the  other states for copies of their laws to be kept in the state library.  Various other duties are performed by the secretary.    Sec.3. The _state auditor_, in some states called _controller_, manages  the financial concerns of the state; that is, the business relating to  the money, debts, land and other property of the state. He examines and  adjusts accounts and claims against the state, and superintends the  collection of moneys due the state. When money is to be paid out of the  treasury, he draws a warrant (a written order,) on the treasurer for the  money, and keeps a regular account with the treasurer of all moneys  received into and paid out of the treasury. And he reports to the  legislature"]]]
