How Field seized upon my absence from the city for the briefest visit  to bombard me with queer and fanciful letters, found another  illustration during Christmas week, 1885, which I spent with a house  party at Blair Lodge, the home of Walter Cranston Larned, whom I have  already mentioned as the possessor of Field's two masterpieces in  color. Each day of my stay was enlivened by a letter from Field. As  they are admirable specimens of the wonderful pains he took with  letters of this sort, and the expertness he attained in the command  of the archaic form of English, I need no excuse for introducing them  here. The first, which bears date \"December 27th, 1385,\" was written  on an imitation sheet of old letter paper, browned with dirt and  ragged edged. In the order of receipt these letters were as follows:      Soothly, sweet Sir, by thy hegira am I brought into sore distress and    grievous discomfiture; for not only doth that austere man, Sir    Melville, make me to perform prodigies of literary prowess, but all    the other knights do laugh me to scorn and entreat me shamelessly    when I be an hungered and do importune them for pelf whereby I may    compass victual. Aye, marry, by my faith, I swear't, it hath gone ill    with me since you strode from my castle in the direction of the    province wherein doth dwell Sir Walter, the Knight of the Tennis and    Toboggan. I beseech thee to hie presently unto me, or at least to    send silver or gold wherewith I may procure cheer--else will it go    hard with me, mayhap I shall die, in which event I do hereby name and    constitute thee executor of my estates and I do call upon the saints    in heaven to witness the solemn instrument. Verily, good Sir, I do    grievously miss thee and I do pine for thy joyous discourse and    triumphant cheer, nor, by my blade, shall I be content until once    more thou art come to keep me company.      Touching that varlet Knight, Sir Frank de Dock, I have naught to say,    save and excepting only that he be a caitiff and base-born dotard    that did deride me and steal away unto his castle this very night    when I did supplicate him to regale me with goodly viands around the    board of that noble host, the gracious Sir Wralsy of Murdough. I    would to heaven a murrain would seize the hearts of all such craven    caitiffs who hath not in them the sweet courtesy and generous    hospitality that doth so well become thee, O glorious and    ever-to-be-mulcted Sir Knight of the well-stored wallet. I do beseech    thee to have a care to spread about in the province wherein thou dost    sojourn a fair report of my gentleness and valor. Commend me to the    glorious and triumphant ladies and privily advise them to send me    hence guerdons of gold or silver if haply they are tormented by base    enchanters, cruel dragons, vile hippogriffins, or other untoward    monsters, and I do swear to redress their wrongs when those guerdons    do come unto me. For it doth delight me beyond all else to avenge    foul insults heaped upon princesses and lorn maidens. If so be thou    dost behold that incomparable pearl of female beauty and virtue, the    Fair Unknown, prithee kiss thou her bejewelled hand for me and by thy    invincible blade renew my allegiance unto her sweet cause. Methinks    her sunny locks and azure orbs do haunt my dreams, and anon I hear    her silvery tones supplicating me to accept another arms. And I do    lustily beshrew fate that these be but dreams.      Now in very sooth do I pray ye may speedily come unto me. Or if you    abide in that far-off province, heaven grant ye prosperity and    happiness such as surely cannot befall the Good Knight till thou dost    uplift his arms again.      I do supplicate thee to make obeisance unto all in my name and to    send hither tidings of thy well-being. How goeth the jousts and    tourneys with the toboggan, and hath the cyclonic Sir Barbour wrought    much havoc with his perennial rhetoric in the midst of thee? I do    kiss thy hand and subscribe myself,      Thy sweet and sorry slave,      THE GOOD KNIGHT.    All of this exercise in the phraseology of chivalry was written on a  single sheet of note-paper with such generous margins that the text  only covered a space of two and one-half by four inches on each page.  Next day I received the second of this knightly series:      While I addressed thee fair and subtile words on yester even, O    sweet and incomparable knight! there did enter into my presence a    base enchanter who did evilly enchant and bewitch me, making me to    do dire offence unto the mother tongue. Soothly this base born    enchanter did cause me to write \"arms,\" when soothly I did mean an    \"alms,\" and sore grievousness be come upon me lest haply thou dost    not understand this matter ere this missive reach thee. I do beseech    thee have a care to tell the fair princesses and glorious ladies    that I am in very truth a courteous knight and learned eke, and that    I shall neither taste food nor wine until I have slain the evil    enchanter that did so foully bewitch me. Odds bobs, I trow it was    that varlet dotard, Sir Frank de Dock, who hath entreated me most    naughtily since thou art departed unto that far-off province. By    this courier do I dispatch certain papers of state unto thee, and    faith would I have dispatched thy wages eke, but that caitiff    in minion, Sir Shekelsford, did taunt and revile me when I did    supplicate him to give up.      The incomparable Sir Melville hath all the good knights writing    editorials this eve, from the hoary and senile Dock down to the    knavish squire that sweeps out the castle.      May peace bide with thee in thy waking hours and brood o'er thy    slumbers, good gentle sir, and may heaven speed the day when in fair    health and well-walleted thou shalt return unto      Thy pining and sweet slave,      THE GOOD KNIGHT.    December 28th, 1885.    Before another day elapsed I received the third, and, in some respects,  most interesting of this series, addressed to me by my knightly title  at \"Blair Lodge Castle, Lake Forest,\" which is less than thirty miles  from Chicago:      Joyous and merry knight:--Soothly I wot this be the last message you    shall have from me ere you be come again hence, since else than the    stamp hereupon attached have I none nor ween I whence another can be    gotten. By the bright brow of Saint Aelfrida, this is a sorry world,    and misery and vexation do hedge us round about! A letter did this    day come unto the joyous and buxom wench, the lady Augusta, wherein    did Sir Ballantyne write how that he did not believe that the poem    \"Thine Eyes\" was printed in Sir Slosson's book. Now by St. Dunstan!    right merrily will he rail when so he learneth the whole truth.    Sir Melville hath not yet crossed the drawbridge of the castle,    albeit it lacketh now but the length of a barleycorn till the tenth    hour. Sir Frank de Dock hath hied him home for he is truly a senile    varlet and when I did supplicate him to regale me with a pasty this    night he quoth, \"Out upon thee, thou scurvy leech!\" \"Beshrew    thyself, thou hoary dotard!\" quoth I, nor tarried I in his presence    the saying of a pater noster, but departing hence did sup with that    lusty blade, Sir Paul of Hull, and verily he did regale me as well    beseemeth a good knight and a gentle eke.      Now, by my sword I swear't, all this venal and base-born rabble    shall rue their folly when thou art returned, O nonpareil of all the    brave and hospitable! I pray thee bring rich booty from that    province wherein thou dost now tarry--crowns, derniers, livres,    ducats, golden angels, and farthings. Then soothly shall we make    merry o'er butts of good October brewing. Commend me to the discreet    and beauteous ladies after the manner of that country, for I have    heard their virtues highly praised, it being said that they do sing    well, play the lute and spinet and work fair marvels with the    needle. I do beseech thee bespeak me fair unto the grand seneschal,    Sir Barbour, and thy joyous and courteous host, Sir Walter. In sooth    it is a devilry how I do miss you. Thy friend and slave in sweetness    and humility,      THE GOOD KNIGHT.    December 29th, 1885.          CHAPTER IV    MORE LETTERS      In the fall and winter of 1885-86 I succeeded in inducing Field to  take the only form of exercise he was ever known voluntarily to  indulge. While his column of \"Sharps and Flats\" to the end bore  almost daily testimony to his enthusiastic devotion to the national  game and of his critical familiarity with its fine points and  leading exponents, he was never known to bat or throw a ball. He  never wearied of singing the praises in prose and verse of Michael  J. Kelly, who for many years was the star of the celebrated \"White  Stockings\" of Chicago when it won the National League pennant year  after year. Nor did he cease to revile the Chicago base-ball  management when it transferred \"King Kel\" to the Boston club for the  then unheard-of premium of $10,000. When the base-ball season was at  its height his column would bristle with the proofs of his vivid  interest in it. I have known it on one day to contain over a score  of paragraphs relating to the national game, encouraging the home  nine or lampooning the rival club with all the personal vivacity of  a sporting reporter writing for a country weekly. Interspersed among  these notes would be many an odorous comparison like this, printed  June 28th, 1888:      Benjamin Harrison is a good, honest, patriotic man, and we like him.    But he never stole second base in all his life and he could not swat    Mickey Welch's down curves over the left-field fence. Therefore we    say again,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#9)"],[1," an instance of the fierce things fading for want of any principle  to be fierce about.  Nietzsche had some natural talent for sarcasm:  he could sneer, though he could not laugh; but there is always something  bodiless and without weight in his satire, simply because it has not  any mass of common morality behind it.  He is himself more preposterous  than anything he denounces.  But, indeed, Nietzsche will stand very  well as the type of the whole of this failure of abstract violence.  The softening of the brain which ultimately overtook him was not  a physical accident.  If Nietzsche had not ended in imbecility,  Nietzscheism would end in imbecility.  Thinking in isolation  and with pride ends in being an idiot.  Every man who will  not have softening of the heart must at last have softening of the brain.         This last attempt to evade intellectualism ends in intellectualism,  and therefore in death.  The sortie has failed.  The wild worship of  lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void.  Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately  in Tibet.  He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing  and Nirvana.  They are both helpless--one because he must not  grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything.  The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all  special actions are evil.  But the Nietzscheite's will is quite  equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good;  for if all special actions are good, none of them are special.  They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and  the other likes all the roads.  The result is--well, some things  are not hard to calculate.  They stand at the cross-roads.         Here I end (thank God) the first and dullest business  of this book--the rough review of recent thought.  After this I  begin to sketch a view of life which may not interest my reader,  but which, at any rate, interests me.  In front of me, as I close  this page, is a pile of modern books that I have been turning  over for the purpose--a pile of ingenuity, a pile of futility.  By the accident of my present detachment, I can see the inevitable smash  of the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Tolstoy, Nietzsche and Shaw,  as clearly as an inevitable railway smash could be seen from  a balloon.  They are all on the road to the emptiness of the asylum.  For madness may be defined as using mental activity so as to reach  mental helplessness; and they have nearly reached it.  He who  thinks he is made of glass, thinks to the destruction of thought;  for glass cannot think.  So he who wills to reject nothing,  wills the destruction of will; for will is not only the choice  of something, but the rejection of almost everything.  And as I  turn and tumble over the clever, wonderful, tiresome, and useless  modern books, the title of one of them rivets my eye.  It is called  \"Jeanne d'Arc,\" by Anatole France.  I have only glanced at it,  but a glance was enough to remind me of Renan's \"Vie de Jesus.\"  It has the same strange method of the reverent sceptic.  It discredits  supernatural stories that have some foundation, simply by telling  natural stories that have no foundation.  Because we cannot believe  in what a saint did, we are to pretend that we know exactly what  he felt.  But I do not mention either book in order to criticise it,  but because the accidental combination of the names called up two  startling images of Sanity which blasted all the books before me.  Joan of Arc was not stuck at the cross-roads, either by rejecting  all the paths like Tolstoy, or by accepting them all like Nietzsche.  She chose a path, and went down it like a thunderbolt.  Yet Joan,  when I came to think of her, had in her all that was true either in  Tolstoy or Nietzsche, all that was even tolerable in either of them.  I thought of all that is noble in Tolstoy, the pleasure in plain  things, especially in plain pity, the actualities of the earth,  the reverence for the poor, the dignity of the bowed back.  Joan of Arc had all that and with this great addition, that she  endured poverty as well as admiring it; whereas Tolstoy is only a  typical aristocrat trying to find out its secret.  And then I thought  of all that was brave and proud and pathetic in poor Nietzsche,  and his mutiny against the emptiness and timidity of our time.  I thought of his cry for the ecstatic equilibrium of danger, his hunger  for the rush of great horses, his cry to arms.  Well, Joan of Arc  had all that, and again with this difference, that she did not  praise fighting, but fought.  We KNOW that she was not afraid  of an army, while Nietzsche, for all we know, was afraid of a cow.  Tolstoy only praised the peasant; she was the peasant.  Nietzsche only  praised the warrior; she was the warrior.  She beat them both at  their own antagonistic ideals; she was more gentle than the one,  more violent than the other.  Yet she was a perfectly practical person  who did something, while they are wild speculators who do nothing.  It was impossible that the thought should not cross my mind that she  and her faith had perhaps some secret of moral unity and utility  that has been lost.  And with that thought came a larger one,  and the colossal figure of her Master had also crossed the theatre  of my thoughts.  The same modern difficulty which darkened the  subject-matter of Anatole France also darkened that of Ernest Renan.  Renan also divided his hero's pity from his hero's pugnacity.  Renan even represented the righteous anger at Jerusalem as a mere  nervous breakdown after the idyllic expectations of Galilee.  As if there were any inconsistency between having a love for  humanity and having a hatred for inhumanity!  Altruists, with thin,  weak voices, denounce Christ as an egoist.  Egoists (with  even thinner and weaker voices) denounce Him as an altruist.  In our present atmosphere such cavils are comprehensible enough.  The love of a hero is more terrible than the hatred of a tyrant.  The hatred of a hero is more generous than the love of a philanthropist.  There is a huge and heroic sanity of which moderns can only collect  the fragments.  There is a giant of whom we see only the lopped  arms and legs walking about.  They have torn the soul of Christ  into silly strips, labelled egoism and altruism, and they are  equally puzzled by His insane magnificence and His insane meekness.  They have parted His garments among them, and for His vesture they  have cast lots; though the coat was without seam woven from the top  throughout.        IV THE ETHICS OF ELFLAND           When the business man rebukes the idealism of his office-boy, it  is commonly in some such speech as this:  \"Ah, yes, when one is young,  one has these ideals in the abstract and these castles in the air;  but in middle age they all break up like clouds, and one comes down  to a belief in practical politics, to using the machinery one has  and getting on with the world as it is.\"  Thus, at least, venerable and  philanthropic old men now in their honoured graves used to talk to me  when I was a boy.  But since then I have grown up and have discovered  that these philanthropic old men were telling lies.  What has really  happened is exactly the opposite of what they said would happen.  They said that I should lose my ideals and begin to believe in the  methods of practical politicians.  Now, I have not lost my ideals  in the least; my faith in fundamentals is exactly what it always was.  What I have lost is my old childlike faith in practical politics.  I am still as much concerned as ever about the Battle of Armageddon;  but I am not so much concerned about the General Election.  As a babe I leapt up on my mother's knee at the mere mention  of it.  No; the vision is always solid and reliable.  The vision  is always a fact.  It is the reality that is often a fraud.  As much as I ever did, more than I ever did, I believe in Liberalism.  But there was a rosy time of innocence when I believed in Liberals.         I take this instance of one of the enduring faiths because,  having now to trace the roots of my personal speculation,  this may be counted, I think, as the only positive bias.  I was brought up a Liberal, and have always believed in democracy,  in the elementary liberal doctrine of a self-governing humanity.  If any one finds the phrase vague or threadbare, I can only pause  for a moment to explain that the principle of democracy, as I  mean it, can be stated in two propositions.  The first is this:  that the things common to all men are more important than the  things peculiar to any men.  Ordinary things are more valuable  than extraordinary things; nay, they are more extraordinary.  Man is something more awful than men; something more strange.  The sense of the miracle of humanity itself should be always more vivid  to us than any marvels of power, intellect, art, or civilization.  The mere man on two legs, as such, should be felt as something more  heartbreaking than any music and more startling than any caricature.  Death is more tragic even than death by starvation.  Having a nose  is more comic even than having a Norman nose.         This is the first principle of democracy:  that the essential  things in men are the things they hold in common, not the things  they hold separately.  And the second principle is merely this:  that the political instinct or desire is one of these things  which they hold in common.  Falling in love is more poetical than  dropping into poetry.  The democratic contention is that government  (helping to rule the tribe) is a thing like falling in love,  and not a thing like dropping into poetry.  It is not something  analogous to playing the church organ, painting on vellum,  discovering the North Pole (that insidious habit), looping the loop,  being Astronomer Royal, and so on.  For these things we do not wish  a man to do at all unless he"]]]
