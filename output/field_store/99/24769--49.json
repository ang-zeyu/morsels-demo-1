On the other hand,  all the digestive and procreative functions are inhibited.  What is the significance of this stimulation of some and inhibition  of other organs?  As far as we know, the stimulated organs  increase the efficiency of the animal for fight or for flight.  It is through skeletal muscles that the physical attack or escape  is effected; these muscles alone energize the claws, the teeth,  the hoofs, and the means for flight.  The increased action of the  muscles of the heart and the blood-vessels increases the efficiency  of the circulation; the secretion of the adrenal gland causes a rise  in the blood-pressure; the increased action of the thyroid gland causes  an increased metabolic activity; there is evidence that glycogen  is actively called out, this being the most immediately available  substance for the production of energy; the increased activity  of the respiration is needed to supply the greater need of oxygen  and the elimination of the increased amount of waste products;  the dilatation of the nostrils affords a freer intake of air;  the increased activity of the sweat-glands is needed to regulate  the temperature of the body which the increased metabolism causes to rise.  The activity of all the organs of perception--sight, hearing, smell--  is increased in order that the danger may be more accurately perceived.  It cannot be a mere coincidence that the organs and the tissues  that are stimulated in the emotion of fear are precisely those that  are actually utilized in a physical struggle for self-preservation.    Are any other organs stimulated by fear except those that can  or that do assist in making a defensive struggle?  I know of none.  On the other hand, if an animal could dispense with his bulky  digestive organs, whose functions are suspended by fear, if he could,  so to speak, clear his decks for battle, it would be to his advantage.  Although the marvelous versatility of natural selection apparently  could devise no means of affording this advantage, it nevertheless shut  off the nervous current and saved the vital force which is ordinarily  consumed by these non-combatants in the performance of their functions.  Whatever may be the origin of fear, its phenomena are due to a  stimulation of all the organs and tissues that add to the efficiency  of the physical struggle for self-preservation and an inhibition  of the func-      {illust. caption = FIG.  19--THE BROAD JUMP.  Note the similarity  of the expression to the facial expression of fear and of anger  (Figs. 12 and 21). (Wm. J. Brownlow, drawn from photo.)  tions of the leading organs that do not participate in that struggle--  the non-combatants, so to speak.  Fear arose from injury,  and is one of the oldest and surely the strongest emotion.  By the slow process of vast empiricism nature has evolved the  wonderful defensive motor me-chanism of many animals and of man.  The stimulation of this mechanism leading to a physical struggle is action,  and the stimulation of this mechanism without action is emotion.  We may say, therefore, that fear is a PHYLOGENETIC FIGHT OR FLIGHT (Fig.  18). On this hypothesis all the organs and parts {illust. caption  = FIG.  20.-FINISH OF RELAY RACE.    Compare the facial expression of the runners with those in Figs.  12, 19, 22.  These pictures illustrate the fact that the same  mechanism is stimulated in emotion as in physical action.  (Photo by Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.)}      of the body are integrated, connected, or correlated for the  self-preservation of the individual by the activity of his motor mechanism  (Figs. 12, 19, and 20). We fear not in our hearts alone, not in our  brains alone, not in our viscera alone--fear influences every organ  and tissue; each organ or tissue is stimulated or inhibited according  to its use or hindrance in the physical struggle for existence.  By thus concentrating all or most of the nerve force on the nerve-muscular  mechanism for defense, a greater physical power is developed.  Hence it is that under the stimulus of fear animals are able to perform  preternatural feats of strength.  For the same reason, the exhaustion  following fear will be increased as the powerful stimulus of fear drains  the cup of nervous energy even though no visible action may result.  An animal under the stimulus of fear may be likened to an automobile  with the clutch thrown out but whose engine is racing at full speed.  The gasoline is being consumed, the machinery is being worn,  but the machine as a whole does not move, though the power of its  engine may cause it to tremble.    When this conception is applied to the human beings of today,  certain mysterious phenomena are at once elucidated.  It must be borne  in mind that man has not been presented with any new organs to meet  the requirements of his present state of civilization; indeed, not only  does he possess organs of the same type as those of his savage fellows,  but of the same type also as those possessed by the lower animals even.  In fact, man has reached his present status of civilization with  the primary equipment of brutish organs.  Perhaps the most striking  difference between man and animals lies in the greater control  which man has gained over his primitive instinctive reactions.  As compared with the entire duration of organic evolution,  man came down from his arboreal abode and assumed his new role  of increased domination over the physical world but a moment ago.  And now, though sitting at his desk in command of the complicated  machinery of civilization, when he fears a business catastrophe  his fear is manifested in the terms of his ancestral physical battle  in the struggle for existence.  He cannot fear intellectually,  he cannot fear dispassionately, he fears with all his organs,  and the same organs are stimulated and inhibited as if, instead of it  being a battle of credit, of position, or of honor, it were a physical  battle with teeth and claws.  Whether the cause of acute fear  be moral, financial, social, or stage fright, the heart beats wildly,  the respirations are accelerated, perspiration is increased,  there are pallor, trembling, indigestion, dry mouth, etc.  The phenomena are those which accompany physical exertion  in self-defense or escape.  There is not one group of phenomena  for the acute fear of the president of a bank in a financial  crash and another for the hitherto trusted official who suddenly  and unexpectedly faces the imminent probability of the penitentiary;  or one for a patient who unexpectedly finds he has a cancer  and another for the hunter when he shoots his first big game.  Nature has but one means of response to fear, and whatever its cause  the phenomena are always the same--always physical.    If the stimulus of fear be repeated from day to day, whether in  the case of a mother anxious on account of the illness of a child;  a business man struggling against failure; a politician under contest  for appointment; a broker in the daily hazard of his fortune;  litigants in legal battle, or a jealous lover who fears a rival;  the countless real as well as the baseless fears in daily life,  in fact, all forms of fear, as it seems to me, express themselves  in like terms of ancestral physical contests.  On this law,  fear dominates the various organs and parts of the body.    Anger and fear express opposite emotional states.  Fear is the  expression of a strong desire to escape from danger; anger, of a  strong desire to attack physically and to vanquish opposition.  This hypothesis is strongly supported by the outward expressions  of fear and of anger.  When the business man is conducting a struggle  for existence against his rivals, and when the contest is at  its height, he may clench his fists, pound the table, perhaps show  his teeth, and exhibit every expression of physical combat.  Fixing the jaw and showing the teeth in anger merely emphasize  the remarkable tenacity of phylogeny.  Although the development  of the wonderful efficiency of the hands has led to a modification  of the once powerful canines of our progenitors, the ancestral use  of the teeth for attack and defense is attested in the display of anger.  In all stations of life differences of opinion may lead to argument  and argument to physical combats, even to the point of killing.  The physical violence of the savage and of the brute still lies  surprisingly near the surface (Fig. 21).    We have now presented some of the reasons based largely on gross animal  behavior why fear is to be regarded as a response to phylogenetic  association with physical danger.  In further support of this hypothesis,  I shall now present some clinical and experimental evidence.  Although there is not convincing proof, yet there is evidence that  the effect of the stimulus of fear upon the body when unaccompanied  by physical activity is more injurious than is an actual physical  contest which results in fatigue without gross physical injury.  It is well known that the soldier who, while under fire,  waits in vain for orders to charge, suffers more than the soldier  who flings himself into the fray; and that a wild animal endeavoring  to avoid capture suffers less than one cowering in captivity.  An unexpressed smouldering emotion is measurably relieved by action.  It is probable that the various energizing substances needed in  physical combat, such as the secretions of the thyroid, the adrenals  (Cannon), etc., may cause physical injury to the body when they  are not consumed by action (Fig. 22).    That the brain is definitely influenced--damaged even--  by fear has been proved by the following experiments:  Rabbits were frightened by a dog but were neither injured nor chased.  After various periods of time the animals were killed and their  brain-cells compared with the brain-cells of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12342"],[0,"The Nuttall Encyclopædia (#9)"],[1,"Socrates tried hard to win  over to virtue, but failed.
