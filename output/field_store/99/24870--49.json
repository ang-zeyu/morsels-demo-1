Graytail was some distance up the hill, and suddenly caught sight of a  new foe close at hand, the yellow cur, coming right on. Redruff, much  farther off, could not see him for the bushes, and Graytail became  greatly alarmed.    '_Kwit, kwit_' (Fly, fly), she cried, running down the hill for a start.  '_Kreet, k-r-r-r_' (This way, hide), cried the cooler Redruff, for he  saw that now the man with the gun was getting in range. He gained the  great trunk, and behind it, as he paused a moment to call earnestly to  Graytail, 'This way, this way,' he heard a slight noise under the bank  before him that betrayed the ambush, then there was a terrified cry from  Graytail as the dog sprang at her, she rose in air and skimmed behind  the shielding trunk, away from the gunner in the open, right into the  power of the miserable wretch under the bank.    _Whirr_, and up she went, a beautiful, sentient, noble being.    _Bang_, and down she fell--battered and bleeding, to gasp her life out  and to lie a rumpled mass of carrion in the snow.    It was a perilous place for Redruff. There was no chance for a safe  rise, so he squatted low. The dog came within ten feet of him, and the  stranger, coming across to Cuddy, passed at five feet, but he never  moved till a chance came to slip behind the great trunk away from both.  Then he safely rose and flew to the lonely glen by Taylor's Hill.    One by one the deadly cruel gun had stricken his near ones down, till  now, once more, he was alone. The Snow Moon slowly passed with many a  narrow escape, and Redruff, now known to be the only survivor of his  kind, was relentlessly pursued, and grew wilder every day.    It seemed, at length, a waste of time to follow him with a gun, so when  the snow was deepest, and food scarcest, Cuddy hatched a new plot. Right  across the feeding-ground, almost the only good one now in the Stormy  Moon, he set a row of snares. A cottontail rabbit, an old friend, cut  several of these with his sharp teeth, but some remained, and Redruff,  watching a far-off speck that might turn out a hawk, trod right in one  of them, and in an instant was jerked into the air to dangle by one  foot.    Have the wild things no moral or legal rights? What right has man to  inflict such long and fearful agony on a fellow-creature, simply because  that creature does not speak his language? All that day, with growing,  racking pains, poor Redruff hung and beat his great, strong wings in  helpless struggles to be free. All day, all night, with growing torture,  until he only longed for death. But no one came. The morning broke, the  day wore on, and still he hung there, slowly dying; his very strength a  curse. The second night crawled slowly down, and when, in the dawdling  hours of darkness, a great Horned Owl, drawn by the feeble flutter of a  dying wing, cut short the pain, the deed was wholly kind.           *       *       *       *       *    The wind blew down the valley from the north. The snow-horses went  racing over the wrinkled ice, over the Don Flats, and over the marsh  toward the lake, white, for they were driven snow, but on them,  scattered dark, were riding plumy fragments of partridge ruffs--the  famous rainbow ruffs. And they rode on the wind that night, away, away  to the south, over the dark lake, as they rode in the gloom of his Mad  Moon flight, riding and riding on till they were engulfed, the last  trace of the last of the Don Valley race.    For no partridge is heard in Castle Frank now--and in Mud Creek Ravine  the old pine drum-log, unused, has rotted in silence away.            RAGGYLUG    THE STORY OF A COTTONTAIL RABBIT      Raggylug, or Rag, was the name of a young cottontail rabbit. It was  given him from his torn and ragged ear, a life-mark that he got in his  first adventure. He lived with his mother in Olifant's swamp, where I  made their acquaintance and gathered, in a hundred different ways, the  little bits of proof and scraps of truth that at length enabled me to  write this history.    Those who do not know the animals well may think I have humanized them,  but those who have lived so near them as to know somewhat of their ways  and their minds will not think so.    Truly rabbits have no speech as we understand it, but they have a way of  conveying ideas by a system of sounds, signs, scents, whisker-touches,  movements, and example that answers the purpose of speech; and it must  be remembered that though in telling this story I freely translate from  rabbit into English, _I repeat nothing that they did not say_.          I      The rank swamp grass bent over and concealed the snug nest where  Raggylug's mother had hidden him. She had partly covered him with some  of the bedding, and, as always, her last warning was to 'lay low and say  nothing, whatever happens.' Though tucked in bed, he was wide awake and  his bright eyes were taking in that part of his little green world that  was straight above. A bluejay and a red-squirrel, two notorious thieves,  were loudly berating each other for stealing, and at one time Rag's home  bush was the centre of their fight; a yellow warbler caught a blue  butterfly but six inches from his nose, and a scarlet and black ladybug,  serenely waving her knobbed feelers, took a long walk up one grassblade,  down another, and across the nest and over Rag's face--and yet he never  moved nor even winked.    [Illustration: 'Mammy, Mammy!' he screamed, in mortal terror.]    After awhile he heard a strange rustling of the leaves in the near  thicket. It was an odd, continuous sound, and though it went this way  and that way and came ever nearer, there was no patter of feet with  it. Rag had lived his whole life in the swamp (he was three weeks old)  and yet had never heard anything like this. Of course his curiosity was  greatly aroused. His mother had cautioned him to lay low, but that was  understood to be in case of danger, and this strange sound without  footfalls could not be any to fear.    The low rasping went past close at hand, then to the right, then back,  and seemed going away. Rag felt he knew what he was about, he wasn't a  baby; it was his duty to learn what it was. He slowly raised his  roly-poly body on his short, fluffy legs, lifted his little round head  above the covering of his nest and peeped out into the woods. The sound  had ceased as soon as he moved. He saw nothing, so took one step forward  to a clear view, and instantly found himself face to face with an  enormous Black Serpent.    \"Mammy,\" he screamed in mortal terror as the monster darted at him. With  all the strength of his tiny limbs he tried to run. But in a flash the  Snake had him by one ear and whipped around him with his coils to gloat  over the helpless little baby bunny he had secured for dinner.    \"Mammy--Mammy,\" gasped poor little Raggylug as the cruel monster began  slowly choking him to death. Very soon the little one's cry would have  ceased, but bounding through the woods straight as an arrow came Mammy.  No longer a shy, helpless little Molly Cottontail, ready to fly from a  shadow: the mother's love was strong in her. The cry of her baby had  filled her with the courage of a hero, and-hop, she went over that  horrible reptile. Whack, she struck down at him with her sharp hind  claws as she passed, giving him such a stinging blow that he squirmed  with pain and hissed with anger.    \"M-a-m-m-y,\" came feebly from the little one. And Mammy came leaping  again and again and struck harder and fiercer until the loathsome  reptile let go the little one's ear and tried to bite the old one as she  leaped over. But all he got was a mouthful of wool each time, and  Molly's fierce blows began to tell, as long bloody rips were torn in the  Black Snake's scaly armor.    Things were now looking bad for the Snake; and bracing himself for the  next charge, he lost his tight hold on Baby Bunny, who at once wriggled  out of the coils and away into the underbrush, breathless and terribly  frightened, but unhurt save that his left ear was much torn by the  teeth of that dreadful Serpent.    Molly had now gained all she wanted. She had no notion of fighting for  glory or revenge. Away she went into the woods and the little one  followed the shining beacon of her snow-white tail until she led him to  a safe corner of the Swamp.          II      Old Olifant's Swamp was a rough, brambly tract of second-growth woods,  with a marshy pond and a stream through the middle. A few ragged  remnants of the old forest still stood in it and a few of the still  older trunks were lying about as dead logs in the brushwood. The land  about the pond was of that willow-grown, sedgy kind that cats and horses  avoid, but that cattle do not fear. The drier zones were overgrown with  briars and young trees. The outermost belt of all, that next the fields,  was of thrifty, gummy-trunked young pines whose living needles in air  and dead ones on earth offer so delicious an odor to the nostrils of the  passer-by, and so deadly a breath to those seedlings that would compete  with them for the worthless waste they grow on.    All around for a long way were smooth fields, and the only wild tracks  that ever crossed these fields were those of a thoroughly bad and  unscrupulous fox that lived only too near.    The chief indwellers of the swamp were Molly and Rag. Their nearest  neighbors were far away, and their nearest kin were dead. This was their  home, and here they lived together, and here Rag received the training  that made his success in life.    Molly was a good little mother and gave him a careful bringing up. The  first thing he learned was 'to lay low and say nothing.' His adventure  with the snake taught him the wisdom of this. Rag never forgot that  lesson; afterward he did as he was told, and it made the other things  come more easily.    The second lesson he learned was 'freeze.'

Do you think you could tell her again?\"    Jack thought he could, so his father told him to go by-and-by to the  bridge, and see if she was there, and if so bid her come home to take  tea with them.    And sure enough Jack spied her and told her how his old father had a  wish to meet her, and would she be pleased to drink tea with them.    The girl thanked him kindly, and said she could come the next day; she  was too busy at the moment.    \"All the better,\" said Jack, \"I'll have time to make ready.\"    So when she came Gobborn Seer could see she was a witty woman, and he  asked her if she would marry his Jack. She said \"Yes,\" and they were  married.    Not long after, Jack's father told him he must come with him and build  the finest castle that ever was seen, for a king who wished to outdo all  others by his wonderful castle.    And as they went to lay the foundation-stone, Gobborn Seer said to Jack,  \"Can't you shorten the way for me?\"    But Jack looked ahead and there was a long road before them, and he  said, \"I don't see, father, how I could break a bit off.\"    \"You're no good to me, then, and had best be off home.\"    So poor Jack turned back, and when he came in his wife said, \"Why, how's  this you've come alone?\" and he told her what his father had said and  his answer.    \"You stupid,\" said his witty wife, \"if you had told a tale you would  have shortened the road! Now listen till I tell you a story, and then  catch up with Gobborn Seer and begin it at once. He will like hearing  it, and by the time you are done you will have reached the  foundation-stone.\"    So Jack sweated and overtook his father. Gobborn Seer said never a word,  but Jack began his story, and the road was shortened as his wife had  said.    When they came to the end of their journey, they started building of  this castle which was to outshine all others. Now the wife had advised  them to be intimate with the servants, and so they did as she said, and  it was \"Good-morning\" and \"Good-day to you\" as they passed in and out.    Now, at the end of a twelvemonth, Gobborn, the wise man, had built such  a castle thousands were gathered to admire it.    And the king said: \"The castle is done. I shall return to-morrow and pay  you all.\"    \"I have just a ceiling to finish in an upper lobby,\" said Gobborn, \"and  then it wants nothing.\"    But after the king was gone off, the housekeeper sent for Gobborn and  Jack, and told them that she had watched for a chance to warn them, for  the king was so afraid they should carry their art away and build some  other king as fine a castle, he meant to take their lives on the morrow.  Gobborn told Jack to keep a good heart, and they would come off all  right.    When the king had come back Gobborn told him he had been unable to  complete the job for lack of a tool left at home, and he should like to  send Jack after it.    \"No, no,\" said the king, \"cannot one of the men do the errand?\"    \"No, they could not make themselves understood,\" said the Seer, \"but  Jack could do the errand.\"    \"You and your son are to stop here. But how will it do if I send my own  son?\"    \"That will do.\"    So Gobborn sent by him a message to Jack's wife. \"Give him _Crooked and  Straight_!\"    Now there was a little hole in the wall rather high up, and Jack's wife  tried to reach up into a chest there after \"crooked and straight,\" but  at last she asked the king's son to help her, because his arms were  longest.    But when he was leaning over the chest she caught him by the two heels,  and threw him into the chest, and fastened it down. So there he was,  both \"crooked and straight!\"    Then he begged for pen and ink, which she brought him, but he was not  allowed out, and holes were bored that he might breathe.    When his letter came, telling the king, his father, he was to be let  free when Gobborn and Jack were safe home, the king saw he must settle  for the building, and let them come away.    As they left Gobborn told him: Now that Jack was done with this work, he  should soon build a castle for his witty wife far superior to the  king's, which he did, and they lived there happily ever after.          Lawkamercyme         There was an old woman, as I've heard tell.       She went to the market her eggs for to sell;       She went to the market, all on a market-day,       And she fell asleep on the king's highway.         There came by a pedlar, whose name was Stout,       He cut her petticoats round about;       He cut her petticoats up to the knees,       Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.         When this old woman first did wake,       She began to shiver, and she began to shake;       She began to wonder, and she began to cry--       \"Lawkamercyme, this is none of I!\"         \"But if it be I, as I do hope it be,       I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;       If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,       And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail.\"         Home went the little woman, all in the dark;       Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;       He began to bark, so she began to cry--       \"Lawkamercyme, this is none of I!\"          Tattercoats      In a great Palace by the sea there once dwelt a very rich old lord, who  had neither wife nor children living, only one little granddaughter,  whose face he had never seen in all her life. He hated her bitterly,  because at her birth his favourite daughter died; and when the old nurse  brought him the baby, he swore, that it might live or die as it liked,  but he would never look on its face as long as it lived.    So he turned his back, and sat by his window looking out over the sea,  and weeping great tears for his lost daughter, till his white hair and  beard grew down over his shoulders and twined round his chair and crept  into the chinks of the floor, and his tears, dropping on to the  window-ledge, wore a channel through the stone, and ran away in a little  river to the great sea. And, meanwhile, his granddaughter grew up with  no one to care for her, or clothe her; only the old nurse, when no one  was by, would sometimes give her a dish of scraps from the kitchen, or a  torn petticoat from the rag-bag; while the other servants of the Palace  would drive her from the house with blows and mocking words, calling  her \"Tattercoats,\" and pointing at her bare feet and shoulders, till she  ran away crying, to hide among the bushes.    And so she grew up, with little to eat or wear, spending her days in the  fields and lanes, with only the gooseherd for a companion, who would  play to her so merrily on his little pipe, when she was hungry, or cold,  or tired, that she forgot all her troubles, and fell to dancing, with  his flock of noisy geese for partners.    But, one day, people told each other that the King was travelling  through the land, and in the town near by was to give a great ball, to  all the lords and ladies of the country, when the Prince, his only son,  was to choose a wife.    One of the royal invitations was brought to the Palace by the sea, and  the servants carried it up to the old lord who still sat by his window,  wrapped in his long white hair and weeping into the little river that  was fed by his tears.    But when he heard the King's command, he dried his eyes and bade them  bring shears to cut him loose, for his hair had bound him a fast  prisoner and he could not move. And then he sent them for rich clothes,  and jewels, which he put on; and he ordered them to saddle the white  horse, with gold and silk, that he might ride to meet the King.    Meanwhile Tattercoats had heard of the great doings in the town, and she  sat by the kitchen-door weeping because she could not go to see them.  And when the old nurse heard her crying she went to the Lord of the  Palace, and begged him to take his granddaughter with him to the King's  ball.    But he only frowned and told her to be silent, while the servants  laughed and said: \"Tattercoats is happy in her rags, playing with the  gooseherd, let her be--it is all she is fit for.\"    A second, and then a third time, the old nurse begged him to let the  girl go with him, but she was answered only by black looks and fierce  words, till she was driven from the room by the jeering servants, with  blows and mocking words.    Weeping over her ill-success, the old nurse went to look for  Tattercoats; but the girl had been turned from the door by the cook, and  had run away to tell her friend the gooseherd, how unhappy she was  because she could not go to the King's ball.    But when the gooseherd had listened to her story, he bade her cheer up,  and proposed that they should go together into the town to see the King,  and all the fine things; and when she looked sorrowfully down at her  rags and bare feet, he played a note or two upon his pipe, so gay and  merry, that she forgot all about her tears and her troubles, and before  she well knew, the herdboy had taken her by the hand, and she, and he,  and the geese before them, were dancing down the road towards the town.    Before they had gone very far, a handsome young man, splendidly dressed,  rode up and stopped to ask the way to the castle where the King was  staying; and when he found that they too were going thither, he got off  his horse and walked beside them along the road.    The herdboy pulled out his pipe and played a low sweet tune, and the  stranger looked again and again at Tattercoats' lovely face till he fell  deeply in love with her, and begged her to marry him.    But she only laughed, and shook her golden head.    \"You would be finely put to shame if you had a goosegirl for your wife!\"  said she; \"go and ask one of the great ladies you will see to-night at  the King's ball, and do not flout poor Tattercoats.\"    But the more she refused him the sweeter the pipe played, and the deeper  the young man fell in love; till at last he begged her, as a"]]]
