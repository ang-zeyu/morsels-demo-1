Kiss me, dear.\"    Mary did so, and her radiant smile at such praise from her honored  relative was beautiful to behold.    [Illustration: OLD RAG CARPET]          CHAPTER IX.    POETRY AND PIE.      \"Aunt Sarah,\" questioned Mary one day, \"do you mind if I copy some of  your recipes?\"    \"Certainly not, my dear,\" replied her Aunt.    \"And I'd like to copy some of the poems, also, I never saw any one  else have so much poetry in a book of cooking recipes.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" replied her Aunt, \"but you know, Mary, I believe in  combining pleasure with my work, and our lives are made up of poetry  and prose, and some lives are so very prosy. Many times when too tired  to look up a favorite volume of poems, it has rested me to turn the  pages of my recipe book and find some helpful thought, and a good  housewife will always keep her book of recipes where it may be readily  found for reference. I think, Mary, the poem 'Pennsylvania,' by Lydia  M.D. O'Neil, a fine one, and I never tire of reading it over and over  again. I have always felt grateful to my old schoolmaster. Professor  T----, for teaching me, when a school girl, to love the writing of  Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant, Tennyson and other well-known poets. I  still, in memory, hear him repeat 'Thanatopsis,' by Bryant and 'The  Builders,' by Longfellow. The rhymes of the 'Fireside Poet' are easily  understood, and never fail to touch the heart of common folk. I know  it appears odd to see so many of my favorite poems sandwiched in  between old, valued cooking recipes, but, Mary, the happiness of the  home life depends so largely on the food we consume. On the  preparation and selection of the food we eat depends our health, and  on our health is largely dependent our happiness and prosperity. Who  is it has said, 'The discovery of a new dish makes more for the  happiness of man than the discovery of a star'? So, dearie, you see  there is not such a great difference between the one who writes a poem  and the one who makes a pie. I think cooking should be considered one  of the fine arts--and the woman who prepares a dainty, appetizing dish  of food, which appeals to the sense of taste, should be considered as  worthy of praise as the artist who paints a fine picture to gratify  our sense of sight. I try to mix all the poetry possible in prosaic  every-day life. We country farmers' wives, not having the  opportunities of our more fortunate city sisters, such as witnessing  plays from Shakespeare, listening to symphony concerts, etc., turn to  'The Friendship of Books,' of which Washington Irving writes: 'Cheer  us with the true friendship, which never deceived hope nor deserted  sorrow.'\"    \"Yes,\" said Mary, \"but remember, Aunt Sarah, Chautauqua will be held  next Summer in a near-by town, and, as Uncle John is one of the  guarantors, you will wish to attend regularly and will, I know, enjoy  hearing the excellent lectures, music and concerts.\"    \"Yea,\" replied her Aunt, \"Chautauqua meetings will commence the latter  part of June, and I will expect you and Ralph to visit us then. I  think Chautauqua a godsend to country women, especially farmers'  wives; it takes them away from their monotonous daily toil and gives  them new thoughts and ideas.\"    \"I can readily understand, Aunt Sarah, why the poem, 'Life's Common  Things,' appeals to you; it is because you see beauty in everything.  Aunt Sarah, where did you get this very old poem, 'The Deserted  City'?\"    \"Why, that was given me by John's Uncle, who thought the poem fine.\"        \"Sad is the sight, the city once so fair!      An hundred palaces lie buried there;        Her lofty towers are fallen, and creepers grow        O'er marbled dome and shattered portico.        \"Once in the gardens, lovely girls at play,      Culled the bright flowers, and gently touched the spray;        But now wild creatures in their savage joy        Tread down the flowers and the plants destroy.        \"By night no torches in the windows gleam;      By day no women in their beauty beam;        The smoke has ceased--the spider there has spread        His snares in safety--and all else is dead.\"    \"Indeed, it is a 'gem,'\" said Mary, after slowly reading aloud parts  of several stanzas.    \"Yes,\" replied her Aunt, \"Professor Schmidt tells me the poem was  written by Kalidasa (the Shakespeare of Hindu literature), and was  written 1800 years before Goldsmith gave us his immortal work, 'The  Deserted Village.'\"    \"I like the poem, 'Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel,'\" said Mary, \"and I  think this true by Henry Ward Beecher:\"        \"'Do not be troubled because you have not great virtues,      God made a million spears of grass where He made one tree;      The earth is fringed and carpeted not with forests but with grasses,      Only have enough of little virtues and common fidelities,      And you need not mourn because you are neither a hero nor a saint.'    \"This is a favorite little poem of mine, Aunt Sarah. I'll just write  it on this blank page in your book.\"        There's a little splash of sunshine and a little spot of shade,      always somewhere near,      The wise bask in the sunshine, but the foolish choose the shade.      The wise are gay and happy, on the foolish, sorrow's laid,      And the fault's their own, I fear.        For the little splash of sunshine and the little spot of shade      Are here for joint consumption, for comparison are made;      We're all meant to be happy, not too foolish or too staid.      And the right dose to be taken is some sunshine mixed with shade.    \"Aunt Sarah, I see there is still space on this page to write another  poem, a favorite of mine. It is called, 'Be Strong,' by Maltbie  Davenport.\"            Be Strong!          We are not here to play, to dream, to drift;          We have hard word to do, and loads to lift,          Shun not the struggle; face it, 'tis God's gift.            Be Strong!          Say not the days are evil--who's to blame?          And fold the hands and acquiesce--Oh, shame!          Stand up, speak out, and bravely, in God's name.            Be Strong!          It matters not how deep intrenched the wrong,          How hard the battle goes, the day how long;          Faint not, fight on! Tomorrow comes the song,      LIFE'S COMMON THINGS.            How lovely are life's common things.            When health flows in the veins;          The golden sunshine of the days            When Phoebus holds the reins;            The floating clouds against the blue;            The fragrance of the air;          The nodding flowers by the way;            The green grass everywhere;            The feathery beauty of the elm,            With graceful-swaying boughs.          Where nesting songbirds find a home            And the night wind sighs and soughs;            The hazy blue of distant hill,            With wooded slope and crest;          The crimson sky when low at night            The sun sinks in the West;            The thrilling grandeur of the storm,            The lightning's vivid flash,          The mighty rush of wind and rain,            The thunder's awful crash.            And then the calm that follows storm,            And rainbow in the sky;          The rain-washed freshness of the earth--            A singing bird near by.            And oh, the beauty of the night!            Its hush, its thrill, its charm;          The twinkling brilliance of its stars;            Its tranquil peace and calm.            Oh, loving fatherhood of God            To give us every day          The lovely common things of life            To brighten all the way!            (Susan M. Perkins, in the Boston Transcript)      ABOU BEN ADHEM AND THE ANGEL.        Abou Ben Adhem--may his tribe increase--      Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace      And saw, within the moonlight of his room,      Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,      An angel writing in a book of gold.      Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,      And to the presence in the room he said:      \"What writest thou?\" The vision raised his head,      And with a look made of all sweet accord,      Answered: \"The names of those who love the Lord.\"      \"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so,\"      Replied the angel. Abou spoke low,      But cheerily still, and Said, \"I pray thee, then,      write me as one that loves his fellow-men.\"      The angel wrote and vanished. The next night      It came again, with a great, wakening light,      And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,      And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.        LEIGH HUNT.          CHAPTER X.      SIBYLLA LINSABIGLER.    A very original character was Sibylla Linsabigler, who had been a  member of the Landis household several years. She was Aunt Sarah's  only maid servant, but she disliked being referred to as a servant,  and when she overheard \"Fritz\" Schmidt, as he passed the Landis farm  on his way to the creek for a days fishing, call to Mary: \"Miss  Midleton, will you please send the butter over with the servant today,  as I shall not return home in time for dinner\" Sibylla said, \"I ain't  no servant. I'm hired girl What does that make out if I do work here?  Pop got mad with me 'cause I wouldn't work at home no more for him and  Mom without they paid me. They got three more girls to home yet that  can do the work. My Pop owns a big farm and sent our 'Chon' to the  college, and it's mean 'fer' him not to give us girls money for dress,  so I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#9)"],[1,"travel all night, but I was too much  fatigued to commence a journey of forty-nine miles over Canadian roads  that night. Our example was followed by a widow lady and her little  family.    We had some difficulty obtaining a lodging, the inns being full of  travellers; here, for the first time we experienced something of that  odious manner ascribed, though doubtless too generally, to the American.  Our host seemed perfectly indifferent to the comfort of his guests,  leaving them to wait on themselves or go without what they wanted. The  absence of females in these establishments is a great drawback where  ladies are travelling. The women keep entirely out of sight, or treat  you with that offensive coldness and indifference that you derive little  satisfaction from their attendance.    After some difficulty in obtaining sight of the landlady of the inn at  Cornwall, and asking her to show me a chamber where we might pass the  night, with a most ungracious air she pointed to a door which opened  into a mere closet, in which was a bed divested of curtains, one chair,  and an apology for a wash-stand. Seeing me in some dismay at the sight  of this uninviting domicile, she laconically observed there was that or  none, unless I chose to sleep in a four-bedded room, which had three  tenants in it,--and those gentlemen. This alternative I somewhat  indignantly declined, and in no very good humour retired to my cabin,  where vile familiars to the dormitory kept us from closing our weary  eye-lids till the break of day.    We took an early and hasty breakfast, and again commenced our journey.  Here our party consisted of myself, my husband, a lady and gentleman  with three small children, besides an infant of a month old, all of  whom, from the eldest to the youngest, were suffering from hooping-  cough; two great Cumberland miners, and a French pilot and his  companion--this was a huge amphibious-looking monster, who bounced in  and squeezed himself into a corner seat, giving a knowing nod and  comical grin to the driver, who was in the secret, and in utter defiance  of all remonstrance at this unlooked-for intrusion, cracked his whip  with a flourish, that appeared to be reckoned pretty considerably smart  by two American travellers that stood on either side of the door at the  inn, with their hats not in their hands nor yet on their heads, but  slung by a black ribbon to one of their waistcoat buttons, so as to fall  nearly under one arm. This practice I have seen adopted since, and think  if Johnny Gilpin had but taken this wise precaution he might have saved  both hat and wig.    I was dreadfully fatigued with this day's travelling, being literally  bruised black and blue. We suffered much inconvenience from the  excessive heat of the day, and could well have dispensed with the  company of two out of the four of our bulky companions.      We reached Prescott about five the same afternoon, where we met with  good treatment at the inn; the female servants were all English, and  seemed to vie with each other in attention to us.    We saw little in the town of Prescott to interest or please. After an  excellent breakfast we embarked on board the _Great Britain_, the finest  steamer we had yet seen, and here we were joined by our new friends, to  our great satisfaction.    At Brockville we arrived just in time to enjoy what was to me quite a  novel sight,--a ship-launch. A gay and exciting scene it was. The sun  shone brilliantly on a concourse of people that thronged the shore in  their holiday attire; the church bells rang merrily out, mingling with  the music from the deck of the gaily painted vessel that, with flags and  streamers, and a well-dressed company on board, was preparing for the  launch.    To give additional effect, a salute was fired from a temporary fort  erected for the occasion on a little rocky island in front of the town.  The schooner took the water in fine style, as if eager to embrace the  element which was henceforth to be subject to her. It was a moment of  intense interest. The newly launched was greeted with three cheers from  the company on board the _Great Britain_, with a salute from the little  fort, and a merry peal from the bells, which were also rung in honour of  a pretty bride that came on board with her bridegroom on their way to  visit the falls of Niagara.    Brockville is situated just at the entrance of the lake of the Thousand  Islands, and presents a pretty appearance from the water. The town has  improved rapidly, I am told, within the last few years, and is becoming  a place of some importance.    The shores of the St. Laurence assume a more rocky and picturesque  aspect as you advance among its thousand islands, which present every  variety of wood and rock. The steamer put in for a supply of fire-wood  at a little village on the American side the river, where also we took  on board five-and-twenty beautiful horses, which are to be exhibited at  Cobourg and York for sale.    There was nothing at all worthy of observation in the American village,  unless I except a novelty that rather amused me. Almost every house had  a tiny wooden model of itself, about the bigness of a doll's house, (or  baby-house, I think they are called,) stuck up in front of the roof or  at the gable end. I was informed by a gentleman on board, these baby-  houses, as I was pleased to call them, were for the swallows to build  in.    It was midnight when we passed Kingston, so of course I saw nothing of  that \"key to the lakes,\" as I have heard it styled. When I awoke in the  morning the steamer was dashing gallantly along through the waters of  the Ontario, and I experienced a slight sensation of sickness.    When the waters of the lake are at all agitated, as they sometimes are,  by high winds, you might imagine yourself upon a tempest-tossed sea.    The shores of the Ontario are very fine, rising in waving lines of hill  and dale, clothed with magnificent woods, or enlivened by patches of  cultivated land and pretty dwellings. At ten o'clock we reached Cobourg.    Cobourg, at which place we are at present, is a neatly built and  flourishing village, containing many good stores, mills, a banking-  house, and printing-office, where a newspaper is published once a week.  There is a very pretty church and a select society, many families of  respectability having fixed their residences in or near the town.    To-morrow we leave Cobourg, and shall proceed to Peterborough, from  which place I shall again write and inform you of our future  destination, which will probably be on one of the small lakes of the  Otanabee.          LETTER V.    Journey from Cobourg to Amherst.--Difficulties to be encountered on  first settling in the Backwoods.--Appearance of the Country.--Rice  Lake.--Indian Habits.--Voyage up the Otanabee.--Log-house, and its  Inmates.--Passage boat.--Journey on foot to Peterborough.    Peterborough, Newcastle District.  September 8, 1832.    We left Cobourg on the afternoon of the 1st of September in a light  waggon, comfortably lined with buffalo robes. Our fellow travellers  consisted of three gentlemen and a young lady, all of whom proved very  agreeable, and willing to afford us every information respecting the  country through which we were travelling. The afternoon was fine--one of  those rich mellow days we often experience in the early part of  September. The warm hues of autumn were already visible on the forest  trees, but rather spoke of ripeness than decay. The country round  Cobourg is well cultivated, a great portion of the woods having been  superseded by open fields, pleasant farms, and fine flourishing  orchards, with green pastures, where abundance of cattle were grazing.    The county gaol and court-house at Amherst, about a mile and a half from  Cobourg, is a fine stone edifice, situated on a rising ground, which  commands an extensive view over the lake Ontario and surrounding  scenery. As you advance farther up the country, in the direction of the  Hamilton or Rice Lake plains, the land rises into bold sweeping hills  and dales.    The outline of the country reminded me of the hilly part of  Gloucestershire; you want, however, the charm with which civilization  has so eminently adorned that fine county, with all its romantic  villages, flourishing towns, cultivated farms, and extensive downs, so  thickly covered with flocks and herds. Here the bold forests of oak,  beech, maple, and bass-wood, with now and then a grove of dark pine,  cover the hills, only enlivened by an occasional settlement, with its  log-house and zig-zag fences of split timber: these fences are very  offensive to my eye. I look in vain for the rich hedge rows of my native  country. Even the stone fences in the north and west of England, cold  and bare as they are, are less unsightly. The settlers, however,  invariably adopt whatever plan saves time, labour, and money. The great  law of expediency is strictly observed;--it is borne of necessity.  Matters of taste appear to be little regarded, or are, at all events,  after-considerations.    I could see a smile hover on the lips of my fellow travellers on hearing  of our projected plans for the adornment of our future dwelling.    \"If you go into the backwoods your house must necessarily be a log-  house,\" said an elderly gentleman, who had been a settler many years in  the country. \"For you will most probably be out of the way of a saw-  mill, and you will find so much to do, and so many obstacles to  encounter, for the first two or three years, that you will hardly have  opportunity for carrying these improvements into effect.    \"There is an old saying,\" he added, with a mixture of gravity and good  humour in his looks, \"that I used to hear when I was a boy, 'first  creep* and then go.'
