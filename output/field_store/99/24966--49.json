While they were sitting two rabbits came to play about in the brush.  They ran round and round in a circle, and all their movements were very  quick and twisty. Sometimes they jumped over each other six or seven  times in succession, and every now and then they sat upright on their  hind legs, and washed their faces with their paws. At other times they  picked up a blade of grass, which they ate with great deliberation,  pretending all the time that it was a complicated banquet of cabbage  leaves and lettuce.    While the children were playing with the rabbits an ancient, stalwart  he-goat came prancing through the bracken. He was an old acquaintance of  theirs, and he enjoyed lying beside them to have his forehead scratched  with a piece of sharp stick. His forehead was hard as rock, and the hair  grew there as sparse as grass does on a wall, or rather the way moss  grows on a wall--it was a mat instead of a crop. His horns were long and  very sharp, and brilliantly polished. On this day the he-goat had two  chains around his neck--one was made of butter-cups and the other was  made of daisies, and the children wondered to each other who it was  could have woven these so carefully. They asked the he-goat this  question, but he only looked at them and did not say a word. The  children liked examining this goat's eyes; they were very big, and of  the queerest light-gray colour. They had a strange steadfast look, and  had also at times a look of queer, deep intelligence, and at other times  they had a fatherly and benevolent expression, and at other times  again, especially when he looked sidewards, they had a mischievous,  light-and-airy, daring, mocking, inviting and terrifying look; but he  always looked brave and unconcerned. When the he-goat's forehead had  been scratched as much as he desired he arose from between the children  and went pacing away lightly through the wood. The children ran after  him and each caught hold of one of his horns, and he ambled and reared  between them while they danced along on his either side singing snatches  of bird songs, and scraps of old tunes which the Thin Woman of Inis  Magrath had learned among the people of the Shee.    In a little time they came to Gort na Cloca Mora, but here the he-goat  did not stop. They went past the big tree of the Leprecauns, through  a broken part of the hedge and into another rough field. The sun was  shining gloriously. There was scarcely a wind at all to stir the harsh  grasses. Far and near was silence and warmth, an immense, cheerful  peace. Across the sky a few light clouds sailed gently on a blue so vast  that the eye failed before that horizon. A few bees sounded their deep  chant, and now and again a wasp rasped hastily on his journey. Than  these there was no sound of any kind. So peaceful, innocent and safe did  everything appear that it might have been the childhood of the world as  it was of the morning.    The children, still clinging to the friendly goat, came near the edge  of the field, which here sloped more steeply to the mountain top. Great  boulders, slightly covered with lichen and moss, were strewn about, and  around them the bracken and gorse were growing, and in every crevice of  these rocks there were plants whose little, tight-fisted roots gripped  a desperate, adventurous habitation in a soil scarcely more than half  an inch deep. At some time these rocks had been smitten so fiercely that  the solid granite surfaces had shattered into fragments. At one place  a sheer wall of stone, ragged and battered, looked harshly out from the  thin vegetation. To this rocky wall the he-goat danced. At one place  there was a hole in the wall covered by a thick brush. The goat pushed  his way behind this growth and disappeared. Then the children, curious  to see where he had gone, pushed through also. Behind the bush they  found a high, narrow opening, and when they had rubbed their legs, which  smarted from the stings of nettles, thistles and gorse prickles, they  went into the hole which they thought was a place the goat had for  sleeping in on cold, wet nights. After a few paces they found the  passage was quite comfortably big, and then they saw a light, and  in another moment they were blinking at the god Pan and Caitilin Ni  Murrachu.    Caitilin knew them at once and came forward with welcome.    \"O, Seumas Beg,\" she cried reproachfully, \"how dirty you have let your  feet get. Why don't you walk in the grassy places? And you, Brigid, have  a right to be ashamed of yourself to have your hands the way they are.  Come over here at once.\"    Every child knows that every grown female person in the world has  authority to wash children and to give them food; that is what grown  people were made for, consequently Seumas and Brigid Beg submitted to  the scouring for which Caitilin made instant preparation. When they were  cleaned she pointed to a couple of flat stones against the wall of the  cave and bade them sit down and be good, and this the children did,  fixing their eyes on Pan with the cheerful gravity and curiosity which  good-natured youngsters always give to a stranger.    Pan, who had been lying on a couch of dried grass, sat up and bent an  equally cheerful regard on the children.    \"Shepherd Girl,\" said he, \"who are those children?\"    \"They are the children of the Philosophers of Coilla Doraca; the  Grey Woman of Dun Gortin and the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath are their  mothers, and they are decent, poor children, God bless them.\"    \"What have they come here for?\"    \"You will have to ask themselves that.\"    Pan looked at them smilingly.    \"What have you come here for, little children?\" said he.    The children questioned one another with their eyes to see which of them  would reply, and then Seumas Beg answered:    \"My father sent me to see you, sir, and to say that you were not doing a  good thing in keeping Caitilin Ni Murrachu away from her own place.\"    Brigid Beg turned to Caitilin-\"Your father came to see our father, and  he said that he didn't know what had become of you at all, and that  maybe you were lying flat in a ditch with the black crows picking at  your flesh.\"    \"And what,\" said Pan, \"did your father say to that?\"    \"He told us to come and ask her to go home.\"    \"Do you love your father, little child?\" said Pan.    Brigid Beg thought for a moment. \"I don't know, sir,\" she replied.    \"He doesn't mind us at all,\" broke in Seumas Beg, \"and so we don't know  whether we love him or not.\"    \"I like Caitilin,\" said Brigid, \"and I like you.\"    \"So do I,\" said Seumas.    \"I like you also, little children,\" said Pan. \"Come over here and sit  beside me, and we will talk.\"    So the two children went over to Pan and sat down one each side of him,  and he put his arms about them. \"Daughter of Murrachu,\" said he, \"is  there no food in the house for guests?\"    \"There is a cake of bread, a little goat's milk and some cheese,\" she  replied, and she set about getting these things.    \"I never ate cheese,\" said Seumas. \"Is it good?\"    \"Surely it is,\" replied Pan. \"The cheese that is made from goat's milk  is rather strong, and it is good to be eaten by people who live in the  open air, but not by those who live in houses, for such people do not  have any appetite. They are poor creatures whom I do not like.\"    \"I like eating,\" said Seumas.    \"So do I,\" said Pan. \"All good people like eating. Every person who is  hungry is a good person, and every person who is not hungry is a bad  person. It is better to be hungry than rich.\"    Caitilin having supplied the children with food, seated herself in front  of them. \"I don't think that is right,\" said she. \"I have always been  hungry, and it was never good.\"    \"If you had always been full you would like it even less,\" he replied,  \"because when you are hungry you are alive, and when you are not hungry  you are only half alive.\"    \"One has to be poor to be hungry,\" replied Caitilin. \"My father is poor  and gets no good of it but to work from morning to night and never to  stop doing that.\"    \"It is bad for a wise person to be poor,\" said Pan, \"and it is bad for a  fool to be rich. A rich fool will think of nothing else at first but to  find a dark house wherein to hide away, and there he will satisfy his  hunger, and he will continue to do that until his hunger is dead and  he is no better than dead but a wise person who is rich will carefully  preserve his appetite. All people who have been rich for a long time, or  who are rich from birth, live a great deal outside of their houses, and  so they are always hungry and healthy.\"    \"Poor people have no time to be wise,\" said Caitilin.    \"They have time to be hungry,\" said Pan. \"I ask no more of them.\"    \"My father is very wise,\" said Seumas Beg.    \"How do you know that, little boy?\" said Pan.    \"Because he is always talking,\" replied Seumas. \"Do you always listen,  my dear?\"    \"No, sir,\" said Seumas; \"I go to sleep when he talks.\"    \"That is very clever of you,\" said Pan.    \"I go to sleep too,\" said Brigid.    \"It is clever of you also, my darling. Do you go to sleep when your  mother talks?\"    \"Oh, no,\" she answered. \"If we went to sleep then our mother would pinch  us and say that we were a bad breed.\"    \"I think your mother is wise,\" said Pan. \"What do you like best in the  world, Seumas Beg?\"    The boy thought for a moment and replied: \"I don't know, sir.\"    Pan also thought for a little time.    \"I don't know what I like best either,\" said he. \"What do you like best  in the world, Shepherd Girl?\"    Caitilin's eyes were fixed on his.    \"I don't know yet,\" she answered slowly.    \"May the gods keep you safe from that knowledge,\" said Pan gravely.    \"Why would you say that?\" she replied. \"One must find out all things,  and when we find out a thing we know if it is good or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#9)"],[1,"|a.

(p. 40, l. 15)    (_f_) In some words vowels that would normally form a  diphthong are usually disyllabic by analogy with other  forms derived from the same stem: _fi|e_, _fi|o_ (cf.  _fi|o_), _ri|o_, _ri|e|ron_ (cf. _ri|o_), _con|ti|nu|e_  (cf. _con|ti|nu|o_), _di|a|rio_ (cf. _di|a_), _bri|o|so_  (cf. _bri|o_), _hu|i_, _hu|i|mos_ (cf. _hu|yo_), etc.    Syneresis is rare, but possible, as in _brio|so_ for  _bri|o|so_.    (_g_) Prefixes, except _a_-, usually form separate  syllables: _pre|in|ser|to_, _re|im|pri|mir_, _re|hu|sar_;  but _aho|gar_. If the syllable after _a_-is stressed,  dieresis usually occurs:      A | los | que a|ho|ra a|cla|ma.                  (p. 220, l. 3)    En | la | sub|li|me | so|le|dad | a|ho|ra...                  (p. 188, l. 3)      (2) DIERESIS    By poetic license vowels that normally form one syllable  may often be dissolved into separate syllables (this is  called \"dieresis\") at the will of the poet: _glo|rio|so_  or _glo|ri|o|so_, _rui|do_ or _rue|i|do_, etc.[17] See also  (1), _d_, above.    [Footnote 17: Note that the dieresis mark is generally used  in dieresis of two weak vowels, or of strong and weak  vowels where the strong vowel is stressed.]                                                                page liii  But dieresis is impossible if the diphthong is _ie_ or  _ue_ from Latin _[e]_ and _[o]_ respectively, as in  _bien_, _siente_, _huevo_, _puedo_.      (3) SYNALEPHA    The final vowel or diphthong of one word and the initial  vowel or diphthong of an immediately following word in the  same line usually combine to form one syllable (this is  called \"synalepha\")[18] as in:      Cuan|do | re|cuer|do | la | pie|dad | sin|ce|ra      Con | qu=e e=n | m=i e=|dad | pri|me|ra    En|tra|b=a e=n | nues|tras | vie|jas | ca|te|dra|les.

(p. 49, ll. 6-7)    [Footnote 18: Note that the union of vowels in separate  words is called synalepha, while the union of vowels  within a word is called syneresis. But synalepha may occur  in combinations of vowels in which syneresis would be  impossible. Compare _te|ni|a_ and _ca|no|a_ with:      A|si al | man|ce|bo in|te|rrum|pe (p. 94, l. 13).    Ni | la | mi|ra|da | que | lan|zo al | sos|la|yo (p. 219, l. 8).]    The vowels of three words may thus combine if the middle  word is _a_ (or _ha_) (see also (4), _a_):      Le | di|j=o e=s|t=e a u=|na | mu|jer.

(p. 84, l. 3)    De | sus | a|la|mos | y | huer|tos.      (p. 91, l. 8)    Y hoy | en | sus | can|ta|res | llo|ra.      (p. 84, l. 18)    [Footnote 19: Note that hiatus between words is equivalent  to dieresis within a word.]    Note that, similarly, the vowels of three words may not  combine, if the middle word is _y, e_ (or _he_), _o_ (or  _oh_), _u_:      O|las| de | pla|ta y | a|zul.      (p. 73, l. 12)    Que | la al|ma | no|che | o el | bri|llan|te | di|a.      (p. 180, l. 20)    ?Quien | cal|ma|ra, | iOh Es|pa|na! | tus | pe|sa|res?      (p. 79, l. 7)    And in all such expressions as: _o|cio|so e |  i|rri|ta|do_, _Se|vi|lla | u O|vie|do_, etc.    Except when a vowel is repeated:      Si he es|cu|cha|do | cuan|do ha|bla|bas.      (Calderon, _No hay burlas con el amor_, III)    In modern Spanish, _h_, being silent, has no effect,  but in older Spanish, _h_ for Latin _f_, being then  pronounced, prevented synalepha, as in:      Por | el | mes | e|ra | de | ma|yo    cuan|do | ha|ce | la | ca|lor.      (p. 7, l. 1-2)                                                                  page lv  Hiatus was common in Old Spanish, except when the first  of two words was the definite article, a personal  pronoun-object or the preposition _de_; or when the vowels  were the same.    (_b_) Hiatus is usual when the initial vowel of the second  word has a strong accent (usually the rhythmic accent at  the end of a line or phrase):      Pues | en | fin | me | de|jo | una (Calderon).    Ta|les | fue|ron | ya | es|tos | cual | her|mo|so (Herrera).    Tal | de | lo | al|to | tem|pes|tad | des|he|cha (Maury).    No hay | pla|ce|res | en | su | al | ma.

(p. 139, l. 22)    Yo | le | da|re|; mas | no en | el | ar|pa | de o|ro...      (p. 49, l. 5)    And synalepha is the rule, if stress on the initial  syllable is weak:      A o|tra per|so|na en | Ma|drid.      (p. 36, l. 19)    To|da, to|da e|res | per|fec|ta.      (p. 44, l. 22)    If the vowels are the same, they usually combine into one:      Del | sol | en | la al|ta | cum|bre      (p. 49, l. 13)    Tem|blar | en | tor|no | de el|: un | ar|co in|men|so...      (p. 180, l. 10)      (5) FINAL SYLLABLES    In estimating the number of syllables in a Spanish  verse-line one final unstressed syllable after the last  stressed syllable is counted whether it be present or not;  or, if there be two unstressed syllables at the end of  the line, only one is counted.[21] Thus the following are  considered 8-syllable lines although, in fact, one line  has nine syllables and another has only seven:      La | sal|pi|ca | con | es|com|bros    De | cas|ti|llos | y | de al|ca|za|res...    Pa|ra | vol|ver | a | bro|tar...    [Footnote 21: In Spanish, a word stressed on the final  syllable is called _agudo_; a word with one syllable after  the stress is called _grave_ or _llano_; one with two  syllables after the stress, _esdrujulo: farol, pluma,  pajaro_.]                                                                page lvii  This system of counting syllables obtains in Spanish  because there is one and only one unstressed syllable at  the end of most verse-lines. It would, perhaps, be more  logical to stop the count with the last stressed syllable,  as the French do. For instance, a Spanish 11-syllable  line would be called a \"feminine\" 10-syllable line by the  French; but the French language has only one vowel (_e_)  that may occur in a final unstressed syllable, while in  Spanish there are several (_a, e, o,_ rarely _i, u_).      RIME    Spanish poetry may be in rimed verse or in blank verse.  (1) Rimed verse may have \"consonance,\" in which there is  rime of the last stressed vowel and of any consonants and  vowels that may follow in the line, as in:        En las presas    Yo divido    Lo cogido    Por igual:    Solo quiero    Por riqueza    La belleza    Sin rival.      (p. 75, ll. 5-12)      Madre mia, yo soy nina;    No se enfade, no me rina,    Si fiada en su prudencia    Desahogo mi conciencia,      (p. 51, ll. 10-13)      iCuan solitaria la nacion que un dia    Poblara inmensa gente!    iLa nacion cuyo imperio se extendia    Del ocaso al oriente!      (p. 76, ll. 19-22)                                                               page lviii      iOh tu, que duermes en casto l=echo=,    De sinsabores ajeno el p=echo=,    Y a los encantos de la hermos=ura=    Unes las gracias del coraz=on=,    Deja el descanso, doncella p=ura=,    Y oye los ecos de mi canc=ion=!      (p. 199, ll. 1-6)    In a diphthong consisting of a strong and a weak vowel  the weak vowel may be disregarded in rime. Cf. above:  _prudencia, conciencia; corazon, cancion; igual, rival_.    (2) Or rimed verse may have \"assonance,\" in which there  is rime of the last accented vowel and of any final vowel  that may follow in the line, but not of consonants.[22]    [Footnote 22: Assonance is rare in popular English verse,  but it occurs in some household rimes; e. g.:      Little Tommy Tucker,    He cried for his supper.
