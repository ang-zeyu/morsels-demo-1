The nunnery stands at the outer edge of the town  next the fields, wherein by report there are 70 nuns. Here lives in  archbishop, who has a fine palace in the town; and the governor's palace  is a fair stone building, and looks handsome to the sea, though but  indifferently furnished within: both Spaniards and Portuguese in their  plantations abroad, as I have generally observed, affecting to have large  houses; but are little curious about furniture, except pictures some of  them. The houses of the town are 2 or 3 stories high, the walls thick and  strong, being built with stone, with a covering of pantile; and many of  them have balconies. The principal streets are large, and all of them  paved or pitched with small stones. There are also parades in the most  eminent places of the town, and many gardens, as well within the town as  in the out parts of it, wherein are fruit trees, herbs, saladings and  flowers in great variety, but ordered with no great care nor art.    OF ITS GOVERNOR, SHIPS AND MERCHANTS; AND COMMODITIES TO AND FROM EUROPE.    The governor who resides here is called Don John de Lancastrio, being  descended, as they say, from our English Lancaster family; and he has a  respect for our nation on that account, calling them his countrymen. I  waited on him several times, and always found him very courteous and  civil. Here are about 400 soldiers in garrison. They commonly draw up and  exercise in a large parade before the governor's house; and many of them  attend him when he goes abroad. The soldiers are decently clad in brown  linen, which in these hot countries is far better than woollen; but I  never saw any clad in linen but only these. Beside the soldiers in pay,  he can soon have some thousands of men up in arms on occasion. The  magazine is on the skirts of the town, on a small rising between the  nunnery and the soldiers' church. It is big enough to hold 2 or 3000  barrels of powder; but I was told it seldom has more than 100, sometimes  but 80. There are always a band of soldiers to guard it, and sentinels  looking out both day and night.    A great many merchants always reside at Bahia; for it is a place of great  trade: I found here above 30 great ships from Europe, with 2 of the King  of Portugal's ships of war for their convoy; beside 2 ships that traded  to Africa only, either to Angola, Gambia, or other places on the coast of  Guinea; and abundance of small craft that only run to and fro on this  coast, carrying commodities from one part of Brazil to another.    The merchants that live here are said to be rich, and to have many negro  slaves in their houses, both of men and women. Themselves are chiefly  Portuguese, foreigners having but little commerce with them; yet here was  one Mr. Cock, an English merchant, a very civil gentleman and of good  repute. He had a patent to be our English consul, but did not care to  take upon him any public character because English ships seldom come  hither, here having been none in 11 or 12 years before this time. Here  was also a Dane, and a French merchant or two; but all have their effects  transported to and from Europe in Portuguese ships, none of any other  nation being admitted to trade hither. There is a custom-house by the  seaside, where all goods imported or exported are entered. And to prevent  abuses there are 5 or 6 boats that take their turns to row about the  harbour, searching any boats they suspect to be running of goods.    The chief commodities that the European ships bring hither are linen  cloths, both coarse and fine; some woollens, also as bays, serges,  perpetuanas, etc. Hats, stockings, both of silk and thread,  biscuit-bread, wheat flour, wine (chiefly port) oil olive, butter,  cheese, etc. and salt-beef and pork would there also be good commodities.  They bring hither also iron, and all sorts of iron tools; pewter vessels  of all sorts, as dishes, plates, spoons, etc. looking-glasses, beads, and  other toys; and the ships that touch at St. Jago bring thence, as I said,  cotton cloth, which is afterwards sent to Angola.    The European ships carry from hence sugar, tobacco, either in roll or  snuff, never in leaf, that I know of: these are the staple commodities.  Besides which, here are dye-woods, as fustick, etc. with woods for other  uses, as speckled wood, Brazil, etc. They also carry home raw hides,  tallow, train-oil of whales, etc. Here are also kept tame monkeys,  parrots, parakeets, etc, which the seamen carry home.    CLAYING OF SUGAR.    The sugar of this country is much better than that which we bring home  from our plantations: for all the sugar that is made here is clayed,  which makes it whiter and finer than our muscovada, as we call our  unrefined sugar. Our planters seldom refine any with clay, unless  sometimes a little to send home as presents for their friends in England.  Their way of doing it is by taking some of the whitest clay and mixing it  with water, till it is like cream. With this they fill up the pans of  sugar that are sunk 2 or 3 inches below the brim by the draining of the  molasses out of it: first scraping off the thin hard crust of the sugar  that lies at the top, and would hinder the water of the clay from soaking  through the sugar of the pan. The refining is made by this percolation.  For 10 to 12 days time that the clayish liquor lies soaking down the pan  the white water whitens the sugar as it passes through it; and the gross  body of the clay itself grows hard on the top, and may be taken off at  pleasure; when scraping off with a knife the very upper-part of the sugar  which will be a little sullied, that which is underneath will be white  almost to the bottom: and such as is called Brazil sugar is thus  whitened. When I was here this sugar was sold for about 50 shillings per  100 pounds. And the bottoms of the pots, which is very coarse sugar, for  about 20 shillings per 100 pounds, both sorts being then scarce; for here  was not enough to lade the ships, and therefore some of them were to lie  here till the next season.    THE SEASON FOR THE EUROPEAN SHIPS, AND COIR CABLES: OF THEIR GUINEA TRADE  AND OF THE COASTING TRADE, AND WHALE KILLING.    The European ships commonly arrive here in February or March, and they  have generally quick passages; finding at that time of the year brisk  gales to bring them to the Line, little trouble, then, in crossing it,  and brisk east-north-east winds afterwards to bring them hither. They  commonly return from hence about the latter end of May, or in June. It  was said when I was here that the ships would sail hence the 20th day of  May; and therefore they were all very busy, some in taking in their  goods, others in careening and making themselves ready. The ships that  come hither usually careen at their first coming; here being a hulk  belonging to the king for that purpose. This hulk is under the charge of  the superintendent I spoke of, who has a certain sum of money for every  ship that careens by her. He also provides firing and other necessaries  for that purpose: and the ships do commonly hire of the merchants here  each 2 cables to moor by all the time they lie here, and so save their  own hempen cables; for these are made of a sort of hair that grows on a  certain kind of trees, hanging down from the top of their bodies, and is  very like the black coir in the East Indies, if not the same. These  cables are strong and lasting: and so much for the European ships.    The ships that use the Guinea trade are small vessels in comparison of  the former. They carry out from hence rum, sugar, the cotton cloths of  St. Jago, beads, etc. and bring in return gold, ivory, and slaves; making  very good returns.    The small craft that belong to this town are chiefly employed in carrying  European goods from Bahia, the centre of the Brazilian trade, to the  other places on this coast; bringing back hither sugar, tobacco, etc.  They are sailed chiefly with negro slaves; and about Christmas these are  mostly employed in whale killing: for about that time of the year a sort  of whales, as they call them, are very thick on this coast. They come in  also into the harbours and inland lakes where the seamen go out and kill  them. The fat of them is boiled to oil; the lean is eaten by the slaves  and poor people: and I was told by one that had frequently eaten of it  that the flesh was very sweet and wholesome. These are said to be but  small whales; yet here are so many, and so easily killed, that they get a  great deal of money by it. Those that strike them buy their licence for  it of the king: and I was informed that he receives 30,000 dollars per  annum for this fishery. All the small vessels that use this coasting  traffic are built here; and so are some men of war also for the king's  service. There was one a-building when I was here, a ship of 40 or 50  guns: and the timber of this country is very good and proper for this  purpose. I was told it was very strong, and more durable than any we have  in Europe; and they have enough of it. As for their ships that use the  European trade some of them that I saw there were English built, taken  from us by the French, during the late war, and sold by them to the  Portuguese.    OF THE INHABITANTS OF BAHIA; THEIR CARRYING IN HAMMOCKS: THEIR  ARTIFICERS, CRANE FOR GOODS, AND NEGRO SLAVES.    Besides merchants and others that trade by sea from this port here are  other pretty wealthy men, and several artificers and tradesmen of most  sorts, who by labour and industry maintain themselves very well;  especially such as can arrive at the purchase of a negro slave or two.  And indeed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#9)"],[1,"over the measures  that were adopted. The counsellors, with whom the governor consulted on  matters of state, were appointed by himself. This sort of government was  no better than an absolute despotism.    \"The people suffered much wrong, while Sir Edmund Andros ruled over them,\"  continued Grandfather, \"and they were apprehensive of much more. He had  brought some soldiers with him from England, who took possession of the  old fortress on Castle Island, and of the fortification on Fort Hill.  Sometimes it was rumored that a general massacre of the inhabitants was to  be perpetrated by these soldiers. There were reports, too, that all the  ministers were to be slain or imprisoned.\"    \"For what?\" inquired Charley.    \"Because they were the leaders of the people, Charley,\" said Grandfather.  \"A minister was a more formidable man than a general, in those days. Well;  while these things were going on in America, King James had so misgoverned  the people of England, that they sent over to Holland for the Prince of  Orange. He had married the king's daughter, and was therefore considered  to have a claim to the crown. On his arrival in England, the Prince of  Orange was proclaimed king, by the name of William the Third. Poor old  King James made his escape to France.\"    Grandfather told how, at the first intelligence of the landing of the  Prince of Orange in England, the people of Massachusetts rose in their  strength, and overthrew the government of Sir Edmund Andros. He, with  Joseph Dudley, Edmund Randolph, and his other principal adherents, were  thrown into prison. Old Simon Bradstreet, who had been governor, when King  James took away the charter, was called by the people to govern them  again.    \"Governor Bradstreet was a venerable old man, nearly ninety years of age,\"  said Grandfather. \"He came over with the first settlers, and had been the  intimate companion of all those excellent and famous men who laid the  foundation of our country. They were all gone before him to the grave; and  Bradstreet was the last of the Puritans.\"    Grandfather paused a moment, and smiled, as if he had something very  interesting to tell his auditors. He then proceeded:    \"And now, Laurence,--now, Clara,--now, Charley,--now, my dear little  Alice,--what chair do you think had been placed in the council chamber, for  old Governor Bradstreet to take his seat in? Would you believe that it was  this very chair in which grandfather now sits, and of which he is telling  you the history?\"    \"I am glad to hear it, with all my heart!\" cried Charley, after a shout of  delight. \"I thought Grandfather had quite forgotten the chair.\"    \"It was a solemn and affecting sight,\" said Grandfather, \"when this  venerable patriarch, with his white beard flowing down upon his breast,  took his seat in his Chair of State. Within his remembrance, and even  since his mature age, the site where now stood the populous town, had been  a wild and forest-covered peninsula. The province, now so fertile, and  spotted with thriving villages, had been a desert wilderness. He was  surrounded by a shouting multitude, most of whom had been born in the  country which he had helped to found. They were of one generation, and he  of another. As the old man looked upon them, and beheld new faces  everywhere, he must have felt that it was now time for him to go, whither  his brethren had gone before him.\"    \"Were the former governors all dead and gone?\" asked Laurence.    \"All of them,\" replied Grandfather. \"Winthrop had been dead forty years.  Endicott died, a very old man, in 1665. Sir Henry Vane was beheaded in  London, at the beginning of the reign of Charles the Second. And Haynes,  Dudley, Bellingham and Leverett, who had all been governors of  Massachusetts, were now likewise in their graves. Old Simon Bradstreet was  the sole representative of that departed brotherhood. There was no other  public man remaining to connect the ancient system of government and  manners with the new system, which was about to take its place. The era of  the Puritans was now completed.\"    \"I am sorry for it,\" observed Laurence; \"for, though they were so stern,  yet it seems to me that there was something warm and real about them. I  think, Grandfather, that each of these old governors should have his  statue set up in our State House, sculptured out of the hardest of New  England granite.\"    \"It would not be amiss, Laurence,\" said Grandfather; \"but perhaps clay, or  some other perishable material, might suffice for some of their  successors. But let us go back to our chair. It was occupied by Governor  Bradstreet from April, 1689, until May, 1692. Sir William Phips then  arrived in Boston, with a new charter from King William, and a commission  to be governor.\"          Chapter X      \"And what became of the chair,\" inquired Clara.    \"The outward aspect of our chair,\" replied Grandfather, \"was now somewhat  the worse for its long and arduous services. It was considered hardly  magnificent enough to be allowed to keep its place in the council chamber  of Massachusetts. In fact, it was banished as an article of useless  lumber. But Sir William Phips happened to see it and being much pleased  with its construction, resolved to take the good old chair into his  private mansion. Accordingly, with his own gubernatorial hands, he  repaired one of its arms, which had been slightly damaged\".    \"Why, Grandfather, here is the very arm!\" interrupted Charley, in great  wonderment. \"And did Sir William Phips put in these screws with his own  hands? I am sure, he did it beautifully! But how came a governor to know  how to mend a chair?\"    \"I will tell you a story about the early life of Sir William Phips,\" said  Grandfather. \"You will then perceive, that he well knew how to use his  hands.\"    So Grandfather related the wonderful and true tale of        THE SUNKEN TREASURE      Picture to yourselves, my dear children, a handsome, old-fashioned room,  with a large, open cupboard at one end, in which is displayed a  magnificent gold cup, with some other splendid articles of gold and silver  plate. In another part of the room, opposite to a tall looking-glass,  stands our beloved chair, newly polished, and adorned with a gorgeous  cushion of crimson velvet tufted with gold.    In the chair sits a man of strong and sturdy frame, whose face has been  roughened by northern tempests, and blackened by the burning sun of the  West Indies. He wears an immense periwig, flowing down over his shoulders.  His coat has a wide embroidery of golden foliage; and his waistcoat,  likewise, is all flowered over and bedizened with gold. His red, rough  hands, which have done many a good day's work with the hammer and adze,  are half covered by the delicate lace ruffles at his wrists. On a table  lies his silver-hilted sword, and in a corner of the room stands his  gold-headed cane, made of a beautifully polished West Indian wood.    Somewhat such an aspect as this, did Sir William Phips present, when he  sat in Grandfather's chair, after the king had appointed him governor of  Massachusetts. Truly, there was need that the old chair should be  varnished, and decorated with a crimson cushion, in order to make it  suitable for such a magnificent looking personage.    But Sir William Phips had not always worn a gold embroidered coat, nor  always sat so much at his ease as he did in Grandfather's chair. He was a  poor man's son, and was born in the province of Maine, where he used to  tend sheep upon the hills, in his boyhood and youth. Until he had grown to  be a man, he did not even know how to read and write. Tired of tending  sheep, he next apprenticed himself to a ship-carpenter, and spent about  four years in hewing the crooked limbs of oak trees into knees for  vessels.    In 1673, when he was twenty-two years old, he came to Boston, and soon  afterwards was married to a widow lady, who had property enough to set him  up in business. It was not long, however, before he lost all the money  that he had acquired by his marriage, and became a poor man again. Still,  he was not discouraged. He often told his wife that, some time or other,  he should be very rich, and would build a \"fair brick house\" in the Green  Lane of Boston.    Do not suppose, children, that he had been to a fortune-teller to inquire  his destiny. It was his own energy and spirit of enterprise, and his  resolution to lead an industrious life, that made him look forward with so  much confidence to better days.    Several years passed away; and William Phips had not yet gained the riches  which he promised to himself. During this time he had begun to follow the  sea for a living. In the year 1684, he happened to hear of a Spanish ship,  which had been cast away near the Bahama Islands, and which was supposed  to contain a great deal of gold and silver. Phips went to the place in a  small vessel, hoping that he should be able to recover some of the  treasure from the wreck. He did not succeed, however, in fishing up gold  and silver enough to pay the expenses of his voyage.    But, before he returned, he was told of another Spanish ship or galleon,  which had been cast away near Porto de la Plata. She had now lain as much  as fifty years beneath the waves. This old ship had been laden with  immense wealth; and, hitherto, nobody had thought of the possibility of  recovering any part of it from the deep sea, which was rolling and tossing  it about. But though it was now an old story, and the most aged people had  almost forgotten that such a vessel had been wrecked. William Phips  resolved that the sunken treasure should again be brought to light.    He went to London, and obtained admittance to King James, who had not yet  been driven from his throne. He told the king of the vast wealth that was  lying at the bottom of the sea. King James listened with attention, and  thought this a fine opportunity to fill his treasury with Spanish"]]]
