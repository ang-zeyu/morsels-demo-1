[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12235"],[0,"Popular Law-making (#9)"],[1,"in very early times in  England. \"Disseised of his freehold, of his liberties or his free  customs\"--that is the basis of all our modern law of freedom of trade,  against restraint of trade, and the basis on which our actions against  the modern trusts rest; the right to freely engage in any business, to  be protected against monopoly either of the state or brought about  by competitors, to freely make one's own contracts, for labor or  property, to work as long as one chooses, for what wages one wills,  and all the other liberties of labor and trade. \"Or be outlawed or  exiled or otherwise destroyed\"--that is a broad general phrase for any  interference with a man's property, life, or liberty. \"Nor will we go  upon him\"--that has been translated in various ways, but it means what  it says; it means that the king won't descend upon a man personally or  with his army; nor will we \"send upon him\"--a law officer after  him; \"but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the  land\"--that means jury trial, or at least the law of the land, as it  then was; and that phrase, or its later equivalent--due process of  law--is discussed to-day probably in one case out of every ten that  arise in our highest courts. Many books have been written upon it.  To start with, it means that none of these things can be done except  _under law_; that is, except under a lawsuit; except under a process  in a court, having jury trial if it be a civil case, and also  an indictment if it be a criminal case, with all the rights and  consequences that attend a regularly conducted lawsuit. It must be  done by the courts, and not by the executive, not by the mere will of  the king; and, still more important to us to-day, not by legislatures,  not even by Parliament. \"We will sell to no man, we will deny or delay  to no man, either right or justice,\" needs no explanation; it is  equality before the law, repeated in our own Fourteenth Amendment.    Lastly, we have in cap. 41: \"Merchants shall have safe conduct in  England, subject only to the ancient and allowed customs, not to evil  tolls\"--a forecast of the allowable tariff as well as of the spirit  of modern international law. Finally, there is a chapter on mortmain,  recognizing that land might not be given to monasteries or religious  houses, and particularly under a secret trust; the object being to  keep the land, which made the power of the realm, out of the hands of  the church. As far as that part of it goes, it is merely historical to  us, but it developed into the principle that corporations \"which have  no souls,\" and do not die, should not own too much land, or have too  much power--and that is a very live question in the United States  to-day.    One must not be misled by the generality of the phrase used in chapter  39, and think it unimportant because it looks simple. It is hard for  an American or Englishman to get a fresh mind on these matters. We all  grow up with the notion that nobody has the right to arrest us, nobody  has the right to deprive us of our liberty, even for an hour. If  anybody, be he President of the United States or be he a police  officer, chooses to lay his hand on our shoulder or attempts to  confine us, we have the same right to try him, if he makes a mistake,  as if he were a mere trespasser; and that applies just as much to the  highest authority, to the president, to the general of the army, to  the governor, as it does to a tramp. But one cannot be too often  reminded that this principle is peculiar to English and American  civilization. Throughout the Continent any official, any judge,  anybody \"who has a red band around his cap,\" who, in any indirect way,  represents the state--a railway conductor, a spy, a station agent--not  only has the right to deprive you of your freedom, but you have no  right to question him; the \"red band around the cap\" is a final  answer. Hence that extraordinary incident, at which all England  laughed, the Kupenick robbery. A certain crook who had been a soldier  and was familiar with the drill and the passwords, obtained possession  of an old captain's uniform, walked into a provincial town of some  importance, ordered the first company of soldiers he met to follow  him, and then with that retinue, appeared before the town hall and  demanded of the mayor the keys of the treasury. These were surrendered  without question and he escaped with the money, representing, of  course, that he had orders from the Imperial government. It never  occurred to any one to question a soldier in full uniform, and it was  only some days later, when the town accounts were sent to Berlin to be  approved, that the robbery was discovered.    Such a thing could by no possibility have happened in England or with  us; the town treasurer would at once have demanded his authority, his  order from the civil authorities; the uniform would have failed to  impress him. Moreover, under our local self-government, under our  decentralized system, nobody is _above_ even a town officer, or a  State or city official at the head of his department, however small it  be, except the courts. State officers may not command town officers,  nor Federal officers State officers; nor soldiers give orders to  policemen. The president, the governor, may perhaps remove them; but  that is all. And even the policeman acts at his peril, and may be sued  in the ordinary courts, if he oversteps his authority. The notion that  a free citizen has a right absolutely to question his constraint by  any State officer is peculiar to the English and American people, and  this cannot be too often repeated; for it is what foreigners simply  fail to understand. And it rests on this chapter in the Great Charter,  originally, as amplified and explained by the courts and later acts of  Parliament, such, as the Habeas Corpus Act. If a man is arrested by  any official, that person, however great, has to justify the arrest.  In theory, a man arrested has a right to sue him for damages, and  to sue him criminally for trespass; and if that man, be he private  individual or be he an official or president, cannot show by a \"due  course of law\"--that is, by a due lawsuit, tried with a jury--that he  did it under a duly enacted law, and that the facts of the case were  such as to place the man under that law--then that official, however  high, is just as much liable in the ordinary courts, as if he were the  merest footpad trying to stop a man on the highway--a doctrine almost  unknown to any country in the world outside of England, the United  States, and English colonies.          III    RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ANGLO-SAXON LAW      Going on with the statutes, the next thing we will note is a matter  that concerns the personal relations. It shows again how eagerly our  English common law overruled the church law, the canon law. Although  the church under the pope always pretended that it alone had authority  to regulate relations between the sexes, marriage and divorce, we  found Henry I interfering with the priests themselves, and we now find  as early as 1235, a secular statute which extends the interference of  the secular law over the relations between parent and child; that is,  as to when a child should be legitimate and when not. We shall have a  great deal to say later about marriage and divorce laws, particularly  divorce laws as they exist in this country and as they apparently are  going to be. As early as 1235 the secular courts interfered with the  marriage relation; and the importance of that is here: there is one  great school to-day, including largely clergymen and the divorce  reformers, so-called, who hold substantially that marriage is a  sacrament, or at least a status; that the secular law has nothing to  do with it and should not be allowed to grant a divorce except for  canonical causes, _i.e._, causes recognized by the church; that it  is not like any other contract, which can be set aside with mutual  consent; when a marriage takes place, they say, it is a sacrament,  or, at least, a status ensues which cannot in future be altered.  Consequently, it is not like a contract; for all contracts can be  abrogated by mutual consent. On the other hand, the most radical  people go to the other extreme, and say that marriage _is_ like any  other contract; it is purely a civil contract, not a sacrament, not  a status; just like any other, and some of them go to what is the  logical conclusion of that position and say that therefore marriage,  like any other contract, ought to be ended at any time by the consent  of both parties. The extreme radical view leads to the conclusion that  a man and woman ought to be divorced any time by merely saying that  they want to be; and some States have almost got to this position in  their statutes. This may seem a very far cry from this early statute,  which does not directly concern marriage but the status of children;  nevertheless it has this bearing--it is an interference by Parliament,  by the secular, legislative branch of government, with a relation  which the church believed to belong only to the church. It so happens  that in this instance the secular law instead of being liberal and  kindly was extremely cruel and the reverse of liberal. Under the  church law, when a man married a woman by whom he already had  children, all those children were thereby made legitimate, and that  certainly seems the kindly and the Christian law. But the secular  barons who constituted the Parliament, in their jealousy for the  common law, took the harsher view, that any children born of parents  who are not married at the time they are born shall be illegitimate,  although their parents may marry afterward. Beaumont and Fletcher, in  one of their plays, make a punning reference to that. It seems to have  struck Beaumont and Fletcher as it does us, that it was a cruel law  for the Parliament to make; when the church for once was liberal, it  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12238"],[0,"Science in the Kitchen (#9)"],[1,"writer has aptly said: \"Simplify cookery, thus  reducing the cost of living, and how many longing individuals would  thereby be enabled to afford themselves the pleasure of culture and  social intercourse! When the barbarous practice of stuffing one's guests  shall have been abolished, a social gathering will not then imply, as it  does now, hard labor, expensive outlay, and dyspepsia. Perhaps when that  time arise, we shall be sufficiently civilized to demand pleasures of a  higher sort. True, the entertainments will then, in one sense, be more  costly, as culture is harder to come by than cake. The profusion of  viands now heaped upon the table, betrays poverty of the worst sort.  Having nothing better to offer, we offer victuals; and this we do with  something of that complacent, satisfied air with which some more  northern tribes present their tidbits of whale and walrus.\"          TABLE TOPICS.          \"Let appetite wear reason's golden chain,      and find in due restrain its luxury.\"        A man's food, when he has the means and opportunity of selecting it,      suggests his moral nature. Many a Christian is trying to do by      prayer that which cannot be done except through corrected      diet.--_Talmage._        Our pious ancestors enacted a law that suicides should be buried      where four roads meet, and that a cart-load of stones should be      thrown upon the body. Yet, when gentlemen or ladies commit suicide,      not by cord or steel, but by turtle soup or lobster salad, they may      be buried on consecrated ground, and the public are not ashamed to      read an epitaph upon their tombstones false enough to make the      marble blush.--_Horace Mann._        It is related by a gentleman who had an appointment to breakfast      with the late A.T. Stewart, that the butler placed before them both      an elaborate bill of fare; the visitor selected a list of rare      dishes, and was quite abashed when Mr. Stewart said, \"Bring me my      usual breakfast,--oatmeal and boiled eggs.\" He then explained to his      friend that he found simple food a necessity to him, otherwise he      could not think clearly. That unobscured brain applied to nobler      ends would have won higher results, but the principle remains the      same.--_Sel._        Study simplicity in the number of dishes, and a variety in the      character of the meals.--_Sel._        I have come to the conclusion that more than half the disease which      embitters life is due to avoidable errors in diet, ... and that more      mischief, in the form of actual disease, of impaired vigor, and of      shortened life, accrues to civilized man from erroneous habits of      eating than from the habitual use of alcoholic drink, considerable      as I know that evil to be.--_Sir Henry Thompson._        The ancient Gauls, who were a very brave, strong, and hearty race,      lived very abstemiously. Their food was milk, berries, and herbs.      They made bread of nuts. They had a very peculiar fashion of wearing      a metal ring around the body, the size of which was regulated by act      of Parliament. Any man who outgrew in circumference his metal ring      was looked upon as a lazy glutton, and consequently was disgraced.         To keep in health this rule is wise:         Eat only when you need, and relish food,         chew thoroughly that it may do you good,       have it well cooked, unspiced, and undisguised.        --_Leonardo da Vinci_          THE DIGESTION OF FOODS.    It is important that the housekeeper not only understand the nature and  composition of foods, but she should also know something of their  digestive properties, since food, to be serviceable, must be not only  nutritious, but easily digested. Digestion is the process by which food  rendered soluble, and capable of being absorbed for use in carrying on  the various vital processes.    The digestive apparatus consists of a long and tortuous tube called the  alimentary canal, varying in length from twenty-five to thirty feet,  along which are arranged the various digestive organs,--the mouth, the  stomach, the liver, and the pancreas,--each of which, together with the  intestines, has an important function to perform. In these various  organs nature manufactures five wonderful fluids for changing and  dissolving the several food elements. The mouth supplies the saliva; in  the walls of the stomach are little glands which produce the gastric  juice; the pancreatic juice is made by the pancreas; the liver secretes  bile; while scattered along the small intestines are minute glands  which make the intestinal juice. Each of these fluids has a particular  work to do in transforming some part of the food into suitable material  for use in the body. The saliva acts upon the starch of the food,  changing it into sugar; the gastric juice digests albumin and other  nitrogenous elements; the bile digests fat, and aids in the absorption  of other food elements after they are digested; the pancreatic juice is  not confined in its action to a single element, but digests starch,  fats, and the albuminous elements after they have been acted upon by the  gastric juice; the intestinal juice is capable of acting upon all  digestible food elements.    [Illustration: The Alimentary Canal, _a._ Esophagus; _b._ Stomach; _c._  Cardiac Orifice; _d._ Pylorus; _e._ Small Intestine; _f._ Bile Duct;  _g._ Pancreatic Duct; _h._ Ascending Colon; _i._ Transverse Colon; _j._  Descending Colon; _k._ Rectum.]    THE DIGESTION OF A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD.--A mouthful of bread  represents all, or nearly all, the elements of nutrition. Taking a  mouthful of bread as a representative of food in general, it may be said  that its digestion begins the moment that it enters the mouth, and  continues the entire length of the alimentary canal, or until the  digestible portion of the food has been completely digested and  absorbed. We quote the following brief description of the digestive  process from Dr. J.H. Kellogg's Second Book in Physiology[A]:--    [Footnote A: Good Health Pub. Co., Battle Creek, Mich.]    \"_Mastication._--The first act of the digestive process is mastication,  or chewing the food, the purpose of which is to crush the food and  divide it into small particles, so that the various digestive fluids may  easily and promptly come into contact with every part of it.    \"_Salivary Digestion._--During the mastication of the food, the salivary  glands are actively pouring out the saliva, which mingles with the food,  and by softening it, aids in its division and prepares it for the action  of the other digestive fluids. It also acts upon the starch, converting  a portion of it into grape-sugar.    \"_Stomach Digestion._--After receiving the food, the stomach soon begins  to pour out the gastric juices, which first makes its appearance in  little drops, like beads of sweat upon the face when the perspiration  starts. As the quantity increases, the drops run together, trickle down  the side of the stomach, and mingle with the food. The muscular walls of  the stomach contract upon the food, moving it about with a sort of  crushing action, thoroughly mixing the gastric juice with the food.  During this process both the openings of the stomach are closed tightly.  The gastric juice softens the food, digests albumen, and coagulates  milk. The saliva continues its action upon starch for sometime after the  food reaches the stomach.    \"After the food has remained in the stomach from one to three hours, or  even longer, if the digestion is slow, or indigestible foods have been  eaten, the contractions of the stomach become so vigorous that the more  fluid portions of the food are squeezed out through the pylorus, the  lower orifice of the stomach, thus escaping into the intestine. The  pylorus does not exercise any sort of intelligence in the selection of  food, as was once supposed. The increasing acidity of the contents of  the stomach causes its muscular walls to contract with increasing  vigor, until finally those portions of the food which may be less  perfectly broken up, but which the stomach has been unable to digest,  are forced through the pylorus.    \"_Intestinal Digestion._--As it leaves the stomach, the partially  digested mass of food is intensely acid, from the large quantity of  gastric juices which it contains. Intestinal digestion cannot begin  until the food becomes alkaline. The alkaline bile neutralizes the  gastric juice, and renders the digesting mass slightly alkaline. The  bile also acts upon the fatty elements of the food, converting them into  an emulsion. The pancreatic juice converts the starch into grape-sugar,  even acting upon raw starch. It also digest fats and albumem. The  intestinal juice continues the work begun by the other digestive fluids,  and, in addition, digests cane-sugar, converting it into grape-sugar.    \"_Other Uses of the Digestive Fluids._--In addition to the uses which we  have already stated, several of the digestive fluids possess other  interesting properties. The saliva aids the stomach by stimulating its  glands to make gastric juice. The gastric juice and the bile are  excellent antiseptics, by which the food is preserved from fermentation  while undergoing digestion. The bile also stimulates the movements of  the intestines by which the food is moved along, and aids absorption. It  is remarkable and interesting that a fluid so useful as the bile should  be at the same time composed of waste matters which are being removed  from the body. This is an illustration of the wonderful economy shown by  nature in her operations.    \"The food is moved along the alimentary canal, from the stomach  downward, by successive contractions of the muscular walls of the  intestines, known as peristaltic movements, which occur with great  regularity during digestion.    \"_Absorption_.--The absorption of the food begins as soon as any portion  has been digested.
