Now Nosey Browne and Jorrocks were old friends, and Nosey's affairs  having gone crooked, why of course, like most men in a similar  situation, he was all the better for it; and while his creditors were  taking twopence-halfpenny in the pound, he was taking his diversion on  his wife's property, which a sagacious old father-in-law had secured to  the family in the event of such a contingency as a failure happening; so  knowing Jorrock's propensity for sports, and being desirous of chatting  over all his gallant doings with \"The Surrey,\" shortly after the  above-mentioned day he dispatched a \"twopenny,\" offering him a day's  shooting on his property in Surrey, adding, that he hoped he would dine  with him after. Jorrocks being invited himself, with a freedom peculiar  to fox-hunters, invited his friend the Yorkshireman, and visiting his  armoury, selected him a regular shot-scatterer of a gun, capable of  carrying ten yards on every side.    At the appointed hour on the appointed morning, the Yorkshireman  appeared in Great Coram Street, where he found Mr. Jorrocks in the  parlour in the act of settling himself into a new spruce green cut-away  gambroon butler's pantry-jacket, with pockets equal to holding  a powder-flask each, his lower man being attired in tight drab  stocking-net pantaloons, and Hessian boots with large tassels--a  striking contrast to the fustian pocket-and-all-pocket jackets marked  with game-bag strap, and shot-belt, and the weather-beaten many-coloured  breeches and gaiters, and hob-nail shoes, that compose the equipment of  a shooter in Yorkshire. Mr. Jorrocks not keeping any \"sporting dogs,\" as  the tax-papers call them, had borrowed a fat house-dog--a cross between  a setter and a Dalmatian--of his friend Mr. Evergreen the greengrocer,  which he had seen make a most undeniable point one morning in the  Copenhagen Fields at a flock of pigeons in a beetroot garden. This  valuable animal was now attached by a trash-cord through a ring in his  brass collar to a leg of the sideboard, while a clean licked dish at his  side, showed that Jorrocks had been trying to attach him to himself, by  feeding him before starting.    \"We'll take a coach to the Castle\", said Jorrocks, \"and then get a  go-cart or a cast somehow or other to Streatham, for we shall have  walking enough when we get there. Browne is an excellent fellow, and  will make us range every acre of his estate over half a dozen times  before we give in\". A coach was speedily summoned, into which Jorrocks,  the dog Pompey, the Yorkshireman, and the guns were speedily placed, and  away they drove to the \"Elephant and Castle.\"    There were short stages about for every possible place except Streatham.  Greenwich, Deptford, Blackheath, Eltham, Bromley, Footscray, Beckenham,  Lewisham--all places but the right. However, there were abundance of  \"go-carts,\" a species of vehicle that ply in the outskirts of the  metropolis, and which, like the watering-place \"fly,\" take their name  from the contrary--in fact, a sort of _lucus a non lucendo_. They are  carts on springs, drawn by one horse (with curtains to protect the  company from the weather), the drivers of which, partly by cheating, and  partly by picking pockets, eke out a comfortable existence, and are  the most lawless set of rascals under the sun. Their arrival at  the \"Elephant and Castle\" was a signal for a general muster of the  fraternity, who, seeing the guns, were convinced that their journey was  only what they call \"a few miles down the road,\" and they were speedily  surrounded by twenty or thirty of them, all with \"excellent 'osses, vot  vould take their honours fourteen miles an hour.\" All men of business  are aware of the advantages of competition, and no one more so  than Jorrocks, who stood listening to their offers with the utmost  sang-froid, until he closed with one to take them to Streatham Church  for two shillings, and deliver them within the half-hour, which was a  signal for all the rest to set-to and abuse them, their coachman, and  his horse, which they swore had been carrying \"stiff-uns\" [14] all night,  and \"could not go not none at all\". Nor were they far wrong; for the  horse, after scrambling a hundred yards or two, gradually relaxed into  something between a walk and a trot, while the driver kept soliciting  every passer-by to \"ride,\" much to our sportsmen's chagrin, who  conceived they were to have the \"go\" all to themselves. Remonstrance  was vain, and he crammed in a master chimney-sweep, Major Ballenger the  licensed dealer in tea, coffee, tobacco, and snuff, of Streatham  (a customer of Jorrocks), and a wet-nurse; and took up an Italian  organ-grinder to ride beside himself on the front, before they had  accomplished Brixton Hill. Jorrocks swore most lustily that he would  fine him, and at every fresh assurance, the driver offered a passer-by  a seat; but having enlisted Major Ballenger into their cause, they at  length made a stand, which, unfortunately for them, was more than the  horse could do, for just as he was showing off, as he thought, with a  bit of a trot, down they all soused in the mud. Great was the scramble;  guns, barrel-organ, Pompey, Jorrocks, driver, master chimney-sweep,  Major Ballenger, were all down together, while the wet-nurse, who sat at  the end nearest the door, was chucked clean over the hedge into a dry  ditch. This was a signal to quit the vessel, and having extricated  themselves the best way they could, they all set off on foot, and left  the driver to right himself at his leisure.    [Footnote 14: Doing a bit of resurrection work.]    Ballenger looked rather queer when he heard they were going to Nosey  Browne's, for it so happened that Nosey had managed to walk into his  books for groceries and kitchen-stuff to the tune of fourteen pounds, a  large sum to a man in a small way of business; and to be entertaining  friends so soon after his composition, seemed curious to Ballenger's  uninitiated suburban mind.    Crossing Streatham Common, a short turn to the left by some yew-trees  leads, by a near cut across the fields, to Browne's house; a fiery-red  brick castellated cottage, standing on the slope of a gentle eminence,  and combining almost every absurdity a cockney imagination can be  capable of. Nosey, who was his own \"Nash,\" set out with the intention of  making it a castle and nothing but a castle, and accordingly the windows  were made in the loophole fashion, and the door occupied a third of the  whole frontage. The inconveniences of the arrangements were soon felt,  for while the light was almost excluded from the rooms, \"rude Boreas\"  had the complete run of the castle whenever the door was opened. To  remedy this, Nosey increased the one and curtailed the other, and the  Gothic oak-painted windows and door flew from their positions to make  way for modern plate-glass in rich pea-green casements, and a door of  similar hue. The battlements, however, remained, and two wooden guns  guarded a brace of chimney-pots and commanded the wings of the castle,  one whereof was formed into a green-, the other into a gig-house.    The peals of a bright brass-handled bell at a garden-gate, surmounted by  a holly-bush with the top cut into the shape of a fox, announced their  arrival to the inhabitants of \"Rosalinda Castle,\" and on entering they  discovered young Nosey in the act of bobbing for goldfish, in a  pond about the size of a soup-basin; while Nosey senior, a fat,  stupid-looking fellow, with a large corporation and a bottle nose,  attired in a single-breasted green cloth coat, buff waistcoat, with drab  shorts and continuations, was reposing, _sub tegmine fagi_, in a sort  of tea-garden arbour, overlooking a dung-heap, waiting their arrival to  commence an attack upon the sparrows which were regaling thereon. At  one end of the garden was a sort of temple, composed of oyster-shells,  containing a couple of carrier-pigeons, with which Nosey had intended  making his fortune, by the early information to be acquired by them: but  \"there is many a slip,\" as Jorrocks would say.    Greetings being over, and Jorrocks having paid a visit to the larder,  and made up a stock of provisions equal to a journey through the  Wilderness, they adjourned to the yard to get the other dog, and the  man to carry the game--or rather, the prog, for the former was but  problematical. He was a character, a sort of chap of all work, one, in  short, \"who has no objection to make himself generally useful\"; but if  his genius had any decided bent, it was, perhaps, an inclination towards  sporting.    Having to act the part of groom and gamekeeper during the morning,  and butler and footman in the afternoon, he was attired in a sort of  composition dress, savouring of the different characters performed. He  had on an old white hat, a groom's fustian stable-coat cut down into a  shooting-jacket, with a whistle at the button-hole, red plush smalls,  and top-boots.    There is nothing a cockney delights in more than aping a country  gentleman, and Browne fancied himself no bad hand at it; indeed, since  his London occupation was gone, he looked upon himself as a country  gentleman in fact. \"Vell, Joe,\" said he, striddling and sticking his  thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, to this invaluable man of  all work, \"we must show the gemmem some sport to-day; vich do you think  the best line to start upon--shall we go to the ten hacre field, or the  plantation, or Thompson's stubble, or Timms's turnips, or my meadow, or  vere?\" \"Vy, I doesn't know,\" said Joe; \"there's that old hen-pheasant as  we calls Drab Bess, vot has haunted the plantin' these two seasons, and  none of us ever could 'it (hit), and I hears that Jack, and Tom, and  Bob, are still left out of Thompson's covey; but, my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#9)"],[1,"get the boat out  to go after the slaves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but  they got the other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully for thus  attempting to prefer death to slavery. In this manner we continued to  undergo more hardships than I can now relate, hardships which are  inseparable from this accursed trade. Many a time we were near  suffocation from the want of fresh air, which we were often without  for whole days together. This, and the stench of the necessary tubs,  carried off many. During our passage I first saw flying fishes, which  surprised me very much: they used frequently to fly across the ship,  and many of them fell on the deck. I also now first saw the use of the  quadrant; I had often with astonishment seen the mariners make  observations with it, and I could not think what it meant. They at  last took notice of my surprise; and one of them, willing to increase  it, as well as to gratify my curiosity, made me one day look through  it. The clouds appeared to me to be land, which disappeared as they  passed along. This heightened my wonder; and I was now more persuaded  than ever that I was in another world, and that every thing about me  was magic. At last we came in sight of the island of Barbadoes, at  which the whites on board gave a great shout, and made many signs of  joy to us. We did not know what to think of this; but as the vessel  drew nearer we plainly saw the harbour, and other ships of different  kinds and sizes; and we soon anchored amongst them off Bridge Town.  Many merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the  evening. They put us in separate parcels, and examined us attentively.  They also made us jump, and pointed to the land, signifying we were to  go there. We thought by this we should be eaten by these ugly men, as  they appeared to us; and, when soon after we were all put down under  the deck again, there was much dread and trembling among us, and  nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these  apprehensions, insomuch that at last the white people got some old  slaves from the land to pacify us. They told us we were not to be  eaten, but to work, and were soon to go on land, where we should see  many of our country people. This report eased us much; and sure  enough, soon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all  languages. We were conducted immediately to the merchant's yard, where  we were all pent up together like so many sheep in a fold, without  regard to sex or age. As every object was new to me every thing I saw  filled me with surprise. What struck me first was that the houses were  built with stories, and in every other respect different from those in  Africa: but I was still more astonished on seeing people on horseback.  I did not know what this could mean; and indeed I thought these people  were full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this  astonishment one of my fellow prisoners spoke to a countryman of his  about the horses, who said they were the same kind they had in their  country. I understood them, though they were from a distant part of  Africa, and I thought it odd I had not seen any horses there; but  afterwards, when I came to converse with different Africans, I found  they had many horses amongst them, and much larger than those I then  saw. We were not many days in the merchant's custody before we were  sold after their usual manner, which is this:--On a signal given,(as  the beat of a drum) the buyers rush at once into the yard where the  slaves are confined, and make choice of that parcel they like best.  The noise and clamour with which this is attended, and the eagerness  visible in the countenances of the buyers, serve not a little to  increase the apprehensions of the terrified Africans, who may well be  supposed to consider them as the ministers of that destruction to  which they think themselves devoted. In this manner, without scruple,  are relations and friends separated, most of them never to see each  other again. I remember in the vessel in which I was brought over, in  the men's apartment, there were several brothers, who, in the sale,  were sold in different lots; and it was very moving on this occasion  to see and hear their cries at parting. O, ye nominal Christians!  might not an African ask you, learned you this from your God, who says  unto you, Do unto all men as you would men should do unto you? Is it  not enough that we are torn from our country and friends to toil for  your luxury and lust of gain? Must every tender feeling be likewise  sacrificed to your avarice? Are the dearest friends and relations, now  rendered more dear by their separation from their kindred, still to be  parted from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of  slavery with the small comfort of being together and mingling their  sufferings and sorrows? Why are parents to lose their children,  brothers their sisters, or husbands their wives? Surely this is a new  refinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone for  it, thus aggravates distress, and adds fresh horrors even to the  wretchedness of slavery.          CHAP.

I stayed in this island for a few days; I believe it could not be  above a fortnight; when I and some few more slaves, that were not  saleable amongst the rest, from very much fretting, were shipped off  in a sloop for North America. On the passage we were better treated  than when we were coming from Africa, and we had plenty of rice and  fat pork. We were landed up a river a good way from the sea, about  Virginia county, where we saw few or none of our native Africans, and  not one soul who could talk to me. I was a few weeks weeding grass,  and gathering stones in a plantation; and at last all my companions  were distributed different ways, and only myself was left. I was now  exceedingly miserable, and thought myself worse off than any of the  rest of my companions; for they could talk to each other, but I had no  person to speak to that I could understand. In this state I was  constantly grieving and pining, and wishing for death rather than any  thing else. While I was in this plantation the gentleman, to whom I  suppose the estate belonged, being unwell, I was one day sent for to  his dwelling house to fan him; when I came into the room where he was  I was very much affrighted at some things I saw, and the more so as I  had seen a black woman slave as I came through the house, who was  cooking the dinner, and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with  various kinds of iron machines; she had one particularly on her head,  which locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak; and  could not eat nor drink. I was much astonished and shocked at this  contrivance, which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle.  Soon after I had a fan put into my hand, to fan the gentleman while he  slept; and so I did indeed with great fear. While he was fast asleep I  indulged myself a great deal in looking about the room, which to me  appeared very fine and curious. The first object that engaged my  attention was a watch which hung on the chimney, and was going. I was  quite surprised at the noise it made, and was afraid it would tell the  gentleman any thing I might do amiss: and when I immediately after  observed a picture hanging in the room, which appeared constantly to  look at me, I was still more affrighted, having never seen such things  as these before. At one time I thought it was something relative to  magic; and not seeing it move I thought it might be some way the  whites had to keep their great men when they died, and offer them  libation as we used to do to our friendly spirits. In this state of  anxiety I remained till my master awoke, when I was dismissed out of  the room, to my no small satisfaction and relief; for I thought that  these people were all made up of wonders. In this place I was called  Jacob; but on board the African snow I was called Michael. I had been  some time in this miserable, forlorn, and much dejected state, without  having any one to talk to, which made my life a burden, when the kind  and unknown hand of the Creator (who in very deed leads the blind in a  way they know not) now began to appear, to my comfort; for one day the  captain of a merchant ship, called the Industrious Bee, came on some  business to my master's house. This gentleman, whose name was Michael  Henry Pascal, was a lieutenant in the royal navy, but now commanded  this trading ship, which was somewhere in the confines of the county  many miles off. While he was at my master's house it happened that he  saw me, and liked me so well that he made a purchase of me. I think I  have often heard him say he gave thirty or forty pounds sterling for  me; but I do not now remember which. However, he meant me for a  present to some of his friends in England: and I was sent accordingly  from the house of my then master, one Mr. Campbell, to the place where  the ship lay; I was conducted on horseback by an elderly black man, (a  mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me). When I arrived I  was carried on board a fine large ship, loaded with tobacco, &c. and  just ready to sail for England. I now thought my condition much  mended; I had sails"]]]
