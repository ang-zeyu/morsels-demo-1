These supports should not be  made of any hard material nor should they be good conductors of  heat, as such qualities would result in frequent breakage.    A French magazine suggests making the supports from the large  corks of glass jars in which crystal chemicals are usually  supplied from the dealers. The manner of making them is clearly  shown in the sketch. Each cork is cut as in Fig. 1 and placed on a  wire ring (Fig. 2) whose ends are twisted together and the last  section of cork is cut through from the inner side to the center  and thus fitted over the wire covering the twisted ends, which  binds them together. The corks in use are shown in Fig. 3.        ** Rustic Window Boxes [30]    Instead of using an ordinary green-painted window box, why not  make an artistic one in which the color does not clash with the  plants contained in it but rather harmonizes with them.    Such a window box can be made by anyone having usual mechanical  ability, and will furnish more opportunities for artistic and  original design than many other articles of more complicated  construction.    The box proper should be made a little shorter than the length of  the window to allow for the extra space taken up in trimming and  should be nearly equal in width to the sill, as shown in Fig. 1.  If the sill is inclined, as is usually the case, the box will  require a greater height in front, to make it set level, as shown  in Fig. 2.    The box should be well nailed or screwed together and should then  be painted all over to make it more durable. A number of 1/2-in.  holes should be drilled in the bottom, to allow the excess water  to run out and thus prevent rotting of the plants and box.    Having completed the bare box, it may be trimmed to suit the fancy  of the maker. The design shown in Fig. 1 is very simple and easy  to construct, but may be replaced with a panel or other design.  One form of panel design is shown in Fig. 3.    Trimming having too rough a surface will be found unsuitable for  this work as it is difficult to fasten and cannot be split as well  as smooth trimming. It should be cut the proper length before  being split and should be fastened with brads. The half-round  hoops of barrels will be found very useful in trimming, especially  for filling-in purposes, and by using them the operation of  splitting is avoided. After the box is trimmed, the rustic work  should be varnished, in order to thoroughly preserve it, as well  as improve its appearance.    [Illustration: Artistic Flower Boxes]        ** Antidote for Squirrel Pest [30]    To the owner of a garden in a town where squirrels are protected  by law, life in the summer time is a vexation. First the squirrels  dig up the sweet corn and two or three replantings are necessary.  When the corn is within two or three days of being suitable for  cooking, the squirrels come in droves from far and near. They eat  all they can and carry away the rest. When the corn is gone  cucumbers, cabbages, etc., share the same fate, being partly eaten  into. At the risk of being arrested for killing the squirrels I  have used a small target rifle morning and night, but during my  absence the devastation went on steadily. Last year they destroyed  my entire corn crop. Traps do no good; can't use poison, too  dangerous. But I have solved the difficulty; it's easy.    Shake cayenne pepper over the various vegetables which are being  ruin, and observe results.        ** Homemade Electric Stove [31]  By J. F. THOLL    The construction of an electric stove is very simple, and it can  be made by any home mechanic having a vise and hand drill. The  body is made of sheet or galvanized iron, cut out and drilled as  shown in Fig. 1.    Each long projection represents a leg, which is bent at right  angles on the center line by placing the metal in the jaws of a  vise and hammering the metal over flat. If just the rim is gripped  in the vise, it will give a rounding form to the lower part of the  legs. The small projections are bent in to form a support for the  bottom.    The bottom consists of a square piece of metal, as shown in Fig.  2. Holes are drilled near the edges for stove bolts to fasten it  to the bottom projections. Two of the larger holes are used for  the ends of the coiled rod and the other two for the heating-wire  terminals. The latter holes should be well insulated with  porcelain or mica. The top consists of a square piece of metal  drilled as shown in Fig. 3. Four small ears are turned down to  hold the top in place.    One end of the coiled rod is shown in Fig. 4. This illustrates how  two pins are inserted in holes, drilled at right angles, to hold  the coil on the bottom plate. The coiled rod is 3/16 in.    [Illustration: Pattern for Parts of the Electric Stove]    in diameter and 27 in. long. The rod is wrapped with sheet  asbestos, cut in 1/2-in. strips.    The length of the heating wire must be determined by a test. This  wire can be purchased from electrical stores. Stovepipe wire will  answer the purpose when regular heating wire cannot be obtained.  The wire is coiled around the asbestos-covered rod, so that no  coil will be in contact with another coil. If, by trial, the coil  does not heat sufficiently, cut some of it off and try again.  About 9-1/2 ft. of No. 26 gauge heating wire will be about right.  The connection to an electric-lamp socket is made with ordinary  flexible cord, to which is attached a screw plug for making  connections.        ** Glass-Cleaning Solution [31]    Glass tumblers, tubing and fancy bottles are hard to clean by  washing them in the ordinary way, as the parts are hard to reach  with the fingers or a brush. The following solution makes an  excellent cleaner that will remove dirt and grease from crevices  and sharp corners. To 9 parts of water add 1 part of strong  sulphuric acid. The acid should be added to the water slowly and  not the water to the acid. Add as much bichromate of potash as the  solution will dissolve. More bichromate of potash should be added  as the precipitate is used in cleaning.    The chemicals can be purchased cheaply from a local drug store,  and made up and kept in large bottles. The solution can be used  over and over again. -- Contributed by Loren Ward Des Moines,  Iowa.        ** Automatic-Closing Kennel Door [32]    When the neighborhood cats are retired for the night and there is  nothing more to chase, my fox terrier seems to realize that his  usefulness    [Illustration: Diagram of Closing Door]    for the day is over and begs to be put in his kennel that he may  not bark at the moon as some dogs are apt to do. This necessitates  my putting him out at a time when it may not be convenient.  Frequently in stormy weather this is a disagreeable duty and I  found a way to obviate it by making a trapdoor device for his  kennel as shown in the sketch whereby he may lock himself in when  he crosses the threshold.    The outer half A of the hinged trapdoor is made heavier than the  inner half B by a cleat, C, and a strip, D, to cause the door to  swing shut. The tripper stick E is set between cleats C and F to  hold the door open. When the dog steps on the inner half of the  trapdoor B, it falls to stop G, releasing tripper stick E (which  is heavier on the top end H) to cause it to fall clear of the path  of the trapdoor. The door then swings shut in the direction of the  arrow, the latch I engaging a slot in the door as it closes, and  the dog has locked himself in for the night. The latch I is made  of an old-fashioned gate latch which is mortised in the bottom  joist of the kennel. When releasing the dog in the morning the  door is set for the evening.  --Contributed by Victor Labadie, Dallas, Texas.        ** Polishing Cloths for Silver [32]    Mix 2 lb. of whiting and 1/2 oz. of oleic acid with 1 gal. of  gasoline. Stir and mix thoroughly. Soak pieces of gray outing  flannel of the desired size--15 by 12 in. is a good size--in this  compound. Wring the surplus fluid out and hang them up to dry,  being careful to keep them away from the fire or an open flame.  These cloths will speedily clean silver or plated ware and will  not soil the hands.    In cleaning silver, it is best to wash it first in hot water and  white soap and then use the polishing cloths. The cloths can be  used until they are worn to shreds. Do not wash them. Knives,  forks, spoons and other small pieces of silver will keep bright  and free from tarnish if they are slipped into cases made from the  gray outing flannel and treated with the compound.    Separate bags for such pieces as the teapot, coffee pot, hot-water  pot, cake basket and other large pieces of silverware will keep  them bright and shining.  --Contributed by Katharine D. Morse, Syracuse, N. Y.        ** A Book-Holder [32]    Books having a flexible back are difficult to hold in an upright  position when copying from them. A makeshift combination of  paperweights and other books is often used, but with  unsatisfactory results.    [Illustration: Fig 2. Box Corner Makes a Book Holder]    The book-holder shown in the sketch will hold such books securely,  allow the pages to be turned easily and conceal the smallest  possible portion of each page.    The holder can be cut out of a box corner and fitted with two  screw eyes, which have the part shown by the dotted lines at A  (Fig. 1) removed. The length of the back board determines the  slope for the book rest.  --Contributed by James M.

It was they who gave relief to French Canada from the  absolutism of old France, and started her in a career of self-government  and political liberty. When the great procession passed before the Queen  of England on the day of the \"Diamond Jubilee\"--when delegates from all  parts of a mighty, world-embracing empire gave her their loyal and  heartfelt homage--Canada was represented by a Prime Minister who  belonged to that race which has steadily gained in intellectual  strength, political freedom, and material prosperity, since the  memorable events of 1759 and 1760. In that imperial procession nearly  half the American Continent was represented--Acadia and Canada first  settled by France, the north-west prairies first traversed by French  Canadian adventurers, the Pacific coast first seen by Cook and  Vancouver. There, too, marched men from Bengal, Madras, Bombay,  Jeypore, Haidarabad, Kashmir, Punjaub, from all sections of that great  empire of India which was won for England by Clive and the men who, like  Wolfe, became famous for their achievements in the days of Pitt. Perhaps  there were in that imperial pageant some Canadians whose thoughts  wandered from the Present to the Past, and recalled the memory of that  illustrious statesman and of all he did for Canada and England, when  they stood in Westminster Abbey, and looked on his expressive effigy,  which, in the eloquent language of a great English historian, \"seems  still, with eagle face and outstretched arm, to bid England be of good  cheer and to hurl defiance at her foes.\"          CHAPTER II.    BEGINNINGS OF BRITISH RULE. 1760-1774.      SECTION I.--From the Conquest until the Quebec Act.    For nearly four years after the surrender of Vaudreuil at Montreal,  Canada was under a government of military men, whose headquarters were  at Quebec, Three Rivers, and Montreal--the capitals of the old French  districts of the same name. General Murray and the other commanders  laboured to be just and considerate in all their relations with the new  subjects of the Crown, who were permitted to prosecute their ordinary  pursuits without the least interference on the part of the conquerors.  The conditions of the capitulations of Quebec and Montreal, which  allowed the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, were  honourably kept. All that was required then, and for many years later,  was that the priests and cures should confine themselves exclusively to  their parochial duties, and not take part in public matters. It had been  also stipulated at Montreal that the communities of nuns should not be  disturbed in their convents; and while the same privileges were not  granted by the articles of capitulation to the Jesuits, Recollets, and  Sulpitians, they had every facility given to them to dispose of their  property and remove to France. As a matter of fact there was practically  no interference with any of the religious fraternities during the early  years of British rule; and when in the course of time the Jesuits  disappeared entirely from the country their estates passed by law into  the possession of the government for the use of the people, while the  Sulpitians were eventually allowed to continue their work and develope  property which became of great value on the island of Montreal. (The  French merchants and traders were allowed all the commercial and trading  privileges that were enjoyed by the old subjects of the British  Sovereign, not only in the valley of the St. Lawrence, but in the rich  fur regions of the West and North-West.) The articles of capitulation  did not give any guarantees or pledges for the continuance of the civil  law under which French Canada had been governed for over a century, but  while that was one of the questions dependent on the ultimate fate of  Canada, the British military rulers took every possible care during the  continuance of the military regime to respect so far as possible the old  customs and laws by which the people had been previously governed.  French writers of those days admit the generosity and justice of the  administration of affairs during this military regime.    The treaty of Paris, signed on the 10th February, 1763, formally ceded  to England Canada as well as Acadia, with all their dependencies. The  French Canadians were allowed full liberty \"to profess the worship of  their religion according to the rites of the Romish Church, as far as  the laws of Great Britain permit.\" The people had permission to retire  from Canada with all their effects within eighteen months from the date  of the ratification of the treaty. All the evidence before us goes to  show that only a few officials and seigniors ever availed themselves of  this permission to leave the country. At this time there was not a  single French settlement beyond Vaudreuil until the traveller reached  the banks of the Detroit between Lakes Erie and Huron. A chain of forts  and posts connected Montreal with the basin of the great lakes and the  country watered by the Ohio, Illinois, and other tributaries of the  Mississippi. The forts on the Niagara, at Detroit, at Michillimackinac,  at Great Bay, on the Maumee and Wabash, at Presqu' isle, at the junction  of French Creek with the Alleghany, at the forks of the Ohio, and at  less important localities in the West and South-West, were held by small  English garrisons, while the French still occupied Vincennes on the  Wabash and Chartres on the Mississippi, in the vicinity of the French  settlements at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and the present site of St. Louis.    Soon after the fall of Montreal, French traders from New Orleans and the  French settlements on the Mississippi commenced to foment disaffection  among the western Indians, who had strong sympathy with France, and were  quite ready to believe the story that she would ere long regain Canada.  The consequence was the rising of all the western tribes under the  leadership of Pontiac, the principal chief of the Ottawas, whose  warriors surrounded and besieged Detroit when he failed to capture it by  a trick. Niagara was never attacked, and Detroit itself was successfully  defended by Major Gladwin, a fearless soldier; but all the other forts  and posts very soon fell into the hands of the Indians, who massacred  the garrisons in several places. They also ravaged the border  settlements of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and carried off a number of  women and children to their wigwams. Fort Pitt at the confluence of the  Alleghany and the Monongahela rivers--the site of the present city of  Pittsburg--was in serious peril for a time, until Colonel Bouquet, a  brave and skilful officer, won a signal victory over the Indians, who  fled in dismay to their forest fastnesses. Pontiac failed to capture  Detroit, and Bouquet followed up his first success by a direct march  into the country of the Shawnees, Mingoes and Delawares, and forced them  to agree to stern conditions of peace on the banks of the Muskingum. The  power of the western Indians was broken for the time, and the British in  1765 took possession of the French forts of Chartres and Vincennes, when  the _fleur-de-lys_ disappeared for ever from the valley of the  Mississippi. The French settlers on the Illinois and the Mississippi  preferred to remain under British rule rather than cross the great river  and become subjects of Spain, to whom Western Louisiana had been ceded  by France. From this time forward France ceased to be an influential  factor in the affairs of Canada or New France, and the Indian tribes  recognized the fact that they could no longer expect any favour or aid  from their old ally. They therefore transferred their friendship to  England, whose power they had felt in the Ohio valley, and whose policy  was now framed with a special regard to their just treatment.    This Indian war was still in progress when King George III issued his  proclamation for the temporary government of his new dependencies in  North America. As a matter of fact, though the proclamation was issued  in England on the 7th October, 1763, it did not reach Canada and come  into effect until the 10th August, 1764. The four governments of Quebec,  Grenada, East Florida, and West Florida were established in the  territories ceded by France and Spain. The eastern limit of the province  of Quebec did not extend beyond St. John's River at the mouth of the St.  Lawrence, nearly opposite to Anticosti, while that island itself and the  Labrador country, east of the St. John's as far as the Straits of  Hudson, were placed under the jurisdiction of Newfoundland. The islands  of Cape Breton and St. John, now Prince Edward, became subject to the  Government of Nova Scotia, which then included the present province of  New Brunswick. The northern limit of the province did not extend beyond  the territory known as Rupert's Land under the charter given to the  Hudson's Bay Company in 1670, while the western boundary was drawn  obliquely from Lake Nipissing as far as Lake St. Francis on the St.  Lawrence; the southern boundary then followed line 45 deg. across the upper  part of Lake Champlain, whence it passed along the highlands which  divide the rivers that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those  that flow into the sea--an absurdly defined boundary since it gave to  Canada as far as Cape Rosier on the Gaspe peninsula a territory only a  few miles wide. No provision whatever was made in the proclamation for  the government of the country west of the Appalachian range, which was  claimed by Pennsylvania, Virginia, and other colonies under the  indefinite terms of their original charters, which practically gave  them no western limits. Consequently the proclamation was regarded with  much disfavour by the English colonists on the Atlantic coast. No  provision was even made for the great territory which extended beyond  Nipissing as far as the"]]]
