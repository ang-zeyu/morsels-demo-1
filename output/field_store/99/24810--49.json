In considering the relation of the Brain to the Voice we have not only a  physiological but a psychological problem to deal with. Since language is  essentially a human attribute, we can only study the relation of the Brain  to Speech by observations on human beings who during life have suffered  from various speech defects, and then correlate these defects with the  anatomical changes found in the brain after death.    Between the vocal instrument of the primitive savage and that of the most  cultured singer or orator there is little or no discoverable difference;  neither by careful naked-eye inspection of the brain, nor aided by the  highest powers of the microscope, should we be able to discover any  sufficient structural difference to account for the great difference in the  powers of performance of the vocal instrument of the one as compared with  that of the other; nor is there any sufficient difference in size or minute  structure of the brain to account for the vast store of intellectual  experiences and knowledge of the one as compared with the other. The  cultured being descended from cultured beings inherits tendencies whereby  particular modes of motion or vibration which have been experienced by  ancestors are more readily aroused in the central nervous system; when  similar stimuli producing similar modes of motion affect the sense organs.  But suppose there were an island inhabited only by deaf mutes, upon which a  ship was wrecked, and the sole survivors of the wreck were infants who had  never used the voice except for crying, would these infants acquire  articulate speech and musical vocalisation? I should answer, No. They would  only be able to imitate the deaf mutes in their gesture language and  possibly the musical sounds of birds; for the language a child learns is  that which it hears; they might however develop a simple natural language  to express their emotions by vocal sounds. The child of English-speaking  parents would not be able spontaneously to utter English words if born in a  foreign country and left soon after birth amongst people who could not  speak a word of English, although it would possess a potential facility to  speak the language of its ancestors and race.    It is necessary, however, before proceeding further, to say a few words  explanatory of the brain and its structure, and the reader is referred to  figs. 15, 16, 17. The brain consists of (1) the great brain or cerebrum,  (2) the small brain or cerebellum, and (3) the stem of the brain, which is  continuous with the spinal cord. The cerebro-spinal axis consists of grey  matter and white matter. The grey matter covers the surface of the cerebrum  and cerebellum, the white matter being internal. The stem of the brain, the  medulla oblongata, and the spinal cord, consists externally of white  matter, the grey matter being internal. The grey matter consists for the  most part of nerve cells (ganglion cells), and the white matter consists of  nerve fibres; it is white on account of the phosphoretted fatty  sheath--myelin--that covers the essential axial conducting portion of the  nerve fibres. If, however, the nervous system be examined microscopically  by suitable staining methods, it will be found that the grey and white  matters are inseparably connected, for the axial fibres of the nerves in  the white matter are really prolongations of the ganglion cells of the grey  matter; in fact the nervous system consists of countless myriads of nervous  units or neurones; and although there are structural differences in the  nervous units or neurones, they are all constructed on the same general  architectural plan (_vide_ fig. 15). They may be divided into groups,  systems, and communities; but there are structural differences of the  separate systems, groups, and communities which may be correlated with  differences of function. The systems may be divided into: (1) afferent  sensory, including the special senses and general sensibility; (2) motor  efferent; (3) association.    [Illustration: Fig. 15]    [Description: FIG. 15.--Diagrammatic representation of a motor neurone  magnified 300 diameters. Whereas the nerve cell and its branching processes  (the dendrons) form but a minute speck of protoplasm, the nerve fibre which  arises from it, although microscopic in diameter, extends a very long  distance; in some cases it is a yard long; consequently only a minute  fraction of the nerve fibre is represented in the diagram.]    The great brain or cerebrum consists of two halves equal in weight, termed  hemispheres, right and left; and the grey matter covering their surface is  thrown into folds with fissures between, thus increasing enormously the  superficial area of the grey matter and of the neurones of which it  consists without increasing the size of the head. The pattern of the folds  or convolutions shows a general similarity in all human beings, certain  fissures being always present; and around these fissures which are  constantly present are situated fibre systems and communities of neurones  having particular functions (_vide_ fig. 16.) Thus there is a significance  in the convolutional pattern of the brain. But just as there are no two  faces alike, so there are no two brains alike in their pattern; and just as  it is rare to find the two halves of the face quite symmetrical, so the two  halves of the brain are seldom exactly alike in their pattern. Although  each hemisphere is especially related to the opposite half of the body, the  two are unified in function by a great bridge of nerve fibres, called the  corpus callosum, which unites them. The cortical centres or structures with  specialised functions localised in particular regions of one hemisphere are  associated by fibres passing to the same region in the opposite hemisphere  by this bridge.    [Illustration: Fig. 16]    [Description: FIG. 16.--Diagram of the left hemisphere of the brain showing  localised centres, of which the functions are known. It will be observed  that the centres for the special senses, tactile, muscular, hearing, and  vision, are all situated behind the central fissure. The tactile-motor  kinaesthetic sense occupies the whole of the post-central convolution; the  centre for hearing (and in the left hemisphere memory of words) is shown at  the end of the first temporal convolution, but the portion shaded by no  means indicates the whole of the grey cortex which possesses this function;  a large portion of this centre cannot be seen because it lies within the  fissure forming the upper surface of the temporal lobe. Behind this is the  angular gyrus which is connected with visual word memory. The half-vision  centre, and by this is meant the portion of brain which receives  impressions from each half of the field of vision, is situated for the most  part on the inner (unseen) surface of the occipital lobe. In front of the  central fissure is situated the motor area, or that region destruction of  which causes paralysis of the muscles moving the structures of the opposite  half of the body. If the situations indicated by black dots be excited by  an interrupted electric current, movements of the limbs, trunk, and face  occur in the precise order shown, from the great toe to the larynx. In  front of this precentral convolution are the three frontal convolutions,  and it would seem that the functions of these convolutions are higher  movements and attention in fixation of the eyes; moreover, in the lowest  frontal region, indicated by fine dots, we have Broca's convolution, which  is associated with motor speech; above at the base of the second middle  frontal convolution is the portion of cortex in which is localised the  function of writing. Taste and smell functions reside in brain cortex only  a small portion of which can be seen, viz. that at the tip of the temporal  lobe.]    Muscles and groups of muscles on the two sides of the body which invariably  act together may thus be innervated from either hemisphere, e.g. the  muscles of the larynx, the trunk, and upper part of the face.    Gall, the founder of the doctrine of Phrenology, wrecked his fame as a  scientist by associating mental faculties with conditions of the skull  instead of conditions of the brain beneath; nevertheless, he deserves the  highest credit for his discoveries and deductions, for he was the first to  point out that that part of the brain with which psychic processes are  connected must be the cerebral hemispheres. He said, if we compare man with  animals we find that the sensory functions of animals are much finer and  more highly developed than in man; in man, on the other hand, we find  intelligence much more highly developed than in animals. Upon comparing the  corresponding anatomical conditions, we see, he said, that in animals the  deeper situated parts of the brain are relatively more developed and the  hemispheres less developed than in man; in man, the hemispheres so surpass  in development those of animals that we can find no analogy. Gall therefore  argued that we must consider the cerebral hemispheres to be the seat of the  higher functions of the mind. We must moreover acknowledge that the  following deductions of Gall are quite sound: \"The convolutions ought to be  recognised as the parts where the instincts, feelings, thoughts, talents,  the affective qualities in general, and the moral and intellectual forces  are exercised.\" The Paris Academy of Science appointed a commission of  inquiry, May, 1808, which declared the doctrine of Gall to be erroneous.  Gall moreover surmised that the faculty of language lay in the frontal  lobes, and Bouillaud supported Gall's proposition by citing cases in which  speech had been affected during life, and in which after death the frontal  lobes were found to be damaged by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"the 14th May, 1873.\" Later he writes:--    \"This Magpie breeds in the Darjeeling District in May, June, and July,  most commonly at elevations between 2000 and 4000 feet. It affects  clear cultivated tracts interspersed with a few standing shrubs and  bamboos, in which it builds. The nest is generally placed from 6 to 12  feet from the ground in the inner part of the shrubs, and is made of  pieces of creeper stems intermixed with a few small twigs loosely  put together without any lining. There is scarcely any cup, merely a  depression towards the centre for the eggs to rest in. Internally it  measures about 4.8 in breadth by 1.5 in depth. The eggs are three or  four in number.    \"This is a very common and abundant bird between 2000 and 4000 feet,  but is rarely found far from cultivated fields. It seems to be  exceedingly fond of chestnuts, and, in autumn, when they are ripe,  lives almost entirely on them; but at other times is a great pest in  the grain-fields, devouring large quantities of the grain and being  held in detestation by the natives in consequence. Jerdon says 'it  usually feeds on trees,' but I have seen it quite as frequently  feeding on the ground as on trees.\"    Mr. Hodgson has two notes on the nidification of this species in  Nepal:--\"_May 18th_.--Nest, two eggs and two young; nest on the  fork of a small tree, saucer-shaped, made of slender twigs twisted  circularly and without lining; cavity 3.5 in diameter by 0.5 deep;  eggs yellowish, white, blotched with pale olive chiefly at the larger  end; young just born.    \"_Jaha Powah, 6th June_.--Female and nest in forest on a largish tree  placed on the fork of a branch; a mere bunch of sticks like a  Crow's nest; three eggs, short and thick, fawny white blotched with  fawn-brown chiefly at the thick end.\"    Dr. Jerdon says:--\"I have had the nest and eggs brought me at  Darjeeling frequently. The nest is made of sticks and roots, and  the eggs, three or four in number, are of a pale dull greenish-fawn  colour, with a few pale reddish-brown spots and blotches, sometimes  very indistinct.\"    Captain Hutton tells us that this species \"occurs abundantly at  Mussoorie, at about 5000 feet elevation, during summer, and more  sparingly at greater elevations. In the winter it leaves the mountains  for the Dhoon.    \"It breeds in May, on the 27th of which month I took a nest with three  eggs and another with three young ones. The nest is like that of  _Urocissa occipitalis_, being composed externally of twigs and lined  with finer materials, according to the situation; one nest, taken in  a deep glen by the side of a stream, was lined with the long fibrous  leaves of the Mare's tail (_Equisetum_) which grew abundantly by the  water's edge; another, taken much higher on the hillside and away from  the water, was lined with tendrils and fine roots. The nest is placed  rather low, generally about 8 or 10 feet from the ground, sometimes at  the extremity of a horizontal branch, sometimes in the forks of young  bushy oaks. The eggs somewhat resemble those of _U. occipitalis_, but  are paler and less spotted, being of a dull greenish ash with brown  blotches and spots, somewhat thickly clustered at the larger end.\"    Mr. J.R. Cripps says:--\"On the 15th June, 1880, I found a nest [in the  Dibrugarh District] with three fresh eggs. It was fixed in the middle  branches of a sapling, about ten feet off the ground, in dense  forest, and was built of twigs, presenting a fragile appearance; the  egg-cavity was 41/2 inches [in diameter] and 1 inch deep, and lined with  fine twigs and grass-roots.\"    Captain Wardlaw Ramsay writes:--\"I obtained two eggs of this species  at an elevation of 4200 feet in the Karen hills east of Toungngoo on  the 16th April, 1875.\"    Taking the eggs as a body they are rather regular, somewhat elongated  ovals, but broader and again more pointed varieties occur. The  ground-colour varies a great deal: in a few it is nearly pure white,  generally it has a dull greenish or yellowish-brown tinge, in some  it is creamy, in some it has a decided pinky tinge. The markings are  large irregular blotches and streaks, almost always most dense at the  large end, where they are often more or less confluent, forming an  irregular mottled cap, and not unfrequently very thinly set over the  rest of the surface of the egg. In one egg, however, the zone is about  the thick end, and there are scarcely any markings elsewhere. As a  rule the markings are of an olive-brown of one shade or another; but  when the ground is at all pinkish then the markings are more or less  of a reddish brown. Besides these primary markings, all the eggs  exhibit a greater or smaller number of faint lilac or purple spots or  blotches, which chiefly occur where the other markings are most dense.  In length they vary from 1.06 to 1.22, and in breadth from 0.8 to 1.0,  but the average of 34 eggs is 1.14 by 0.85.      21. Crypsirhina varians (Lath.). _The Black Racket-tailed Magpie_.    Crypsirhina varians (_Lath._), _Hume, Cat._ no. 678 quat.    This Magpie is very common in Lower Pegu, where Mr. Oates found many  nests. He says:--    \"This bird appears to lay from the 1st of June to the 15th of July;  most of my nests were taken in the latter month. It selects either one  of the outer branches of a very leafy thorny bush, or perhaps more  commonly a branch of a bamboo, at heights varying from 5 to 20 feet.    \"The nest is composed of fine dead twigs firmly woven together. The  interior is lined with twisted tendrils of convolvulus and other  creepers. The uniformity with which this latter material is used in  all nests is remarkable. The inside diameter is 5 inches, and the  depth only 1, thus making the structure very flat. The exterior  dimensions are not so definite, for the twigs and creepers stick out  in all directions; but making all allowances, the outside diameter may  be put down at 7 or 8 inches, and the total depth at 11/2 inches.    \"The eggs are usually three in number, but occasionally only two well  incubated eggs may be found. In a nest from which two fresh eggs had  been taken, a third was found a few days later.    \"The eggs measure from 1.09 to .88 in length, and from .76 to .68 in  breadth. The average of 22 eggs is .98 by .72.\"    In shape the eggs are typically moderately broad, rather regular  ovals, but some are distinctly compressed towards the small end, some  are slightly pyriform, some even pointed, though in the great majority  of cases the egg is pretty obtuse at the small end; the shell is  compact and tolerably fine, and has a faint gloss. The ground-colour  seems to be invariably a pale yellowish stone-colour. The markings  vary a good deal: in some they are more speckly, in others more  streaky, but taking them as a whole they are intermediate between  those of _Dendrocitta_ and those of _Garrulus_, neither so bold and  streaky as the former, nor so speckly as the latter. The markings are  a yellowish olive-brown; they consist of spots, specks, small streaky  blotches and frecklings; they are always pretty densely set over the  whole surface of the egg, but they are always most dense in a zone or  sometimes a cap at the large end, where they are often, to a great  extent, confluent. In some eggs small dingy brownish-purple spots  and little blotches are intermingled in the zone. The eggs differ  in general appearance a good deal, because in some almost all the  markings are fine grained and freckly, and in such eggs but little of  the ground-colour is visible, while in other eggs the markings are  bolder (in comparison, for they are never really bold) and thinner  set, and leave a good deal of the ground-colour visible.      23. Platysmurus leucopterus (Temm.). _The White-winged Jay_.    Platysmurus leucopterus (_Temm._), _Hume, Cat._ no. 678 quint.    Mr. W. Davison writes:--    \"I found a nest of this bird on the 8th of April at the hot springs at  Ulu Laugat. The nest was built on the frond of a _Calamus_, the end  of which rested in the fork of a small sapling. The nest was a great  coarse structure like a Crow's, but even more coarsely and irregularly  built, and with the egg-cavity shallower. It was composed externally  of small branches and twigs, and loosely lined with coarse fibres and  strips of bark. It contained two young birds about a couple of days  old. The nest was placed about 6 feet from the ground. The surrounding  jungle was moderately thick, with a good deal of undergrowth.\"      24. Garrulus lanceolatus, Vigors. _The Black-throated Jay_.    Garrulus lanceolatus, _Vig., Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 308; _Hume, Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 670.    The Black-throated Jay breeds throughout the Himalayas, at elevations  of from 4000 to 8000 feet, from the Valley of Nepal to Murree.    They lay from the middle of April until the middle of June.    They build on trees or thick bushes, never at any great height from  the ground, and often within reach of the hand. They always, I think,  choose a densely foliaged tree, and place the nest sometimes in a main  fork and sometimes on some horizontal bough supported by one or more  upright shoots.    All the nests I have seen were moderately shallow cups, built with  slender twigs and sticks, some 6 inches in external diameter, and from  less than 3 inches to nearly 4 inches in height, with a nest-cavity  some 4 inches across and 2 inches deep, lined with grass and  moss-roots. Once only I found a nest almost entirely composed of  grass, and with no lining but fine grass-stems.    The eggs vary from four to six, but this latter number is rarely met  with.    Colonel C.H.T. Marshall writes:--\"This is one of the commonest birds  about Murree; we always found it well to the front during our rambles,  chattering about in the trees. They breed from the middle of April  till the end of June. We have taken their eggs between the 20th April  and the 16th June. They keep above 5000 feet. I"]]]
