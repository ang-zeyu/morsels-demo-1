It is the man, who, on catching sight of the  automobile, nervously gathers up his reins, grabs his whip, and  pulls and jerks, who makes his own troubles; he is searching for  trouble, expects it, and is disappointed if he gets by without it.  Nine times out of ten it is the driver who really frightens the  horse. A country plug, jogging quietly along, quite unterrified,  may be roused to unwonted capers by the person behind.    Some take the antics of their horses quite philosophically. One  old farmer, whose wheezy nag tried to climb the fence, called  out,--    \"Gee whiz! I wish you fellers would come this way every day; the  old hoss hasn't showed so much ginger for ten year.\"    Another, carrying just a little more of the wine of the country  than his legs could bear, stood up unsteadily in his wagon and  shouted,--    \"If you (hic) come around these pa-arts again with that thres-in'  ma-a-chine, I'll have the law on you,--d'ye hear?\"    The personal equation is everything on the road, as elsewhere.    It is quite idle to expect skill, courage, or common sense from  the great majority of drivers. They get along very well so long as  nothing happens, but in emergencies they are helpless, because  they have never had experience in emergencies. The man who has  driven horses all his life is frequently as helpless under unusual  conditions as the novice. Few drivers know when and how to use the  whip to prevent a runaway or a smash-up.    With the exception of professional and a few amateur whips, no one  is ever taught how to drive. Most persons who ride--even country  boys--are given many useful hints, lessons, and demonstrations;  but it seems to be assumed that driving is a natural acquirement.    As a matter of fact, it is much more important to be taught how to  drive than how to ride. A horse in front of a vehicle can do all  the mean things a horse under a saddle can do, and more; and it is  far more difficult to handle an animal in shafts by means of long  reins and a whip.    If people knew half as much about horses as they think they do,  there would be no mishaps; if horses were half as nervous as they  are supposed to be, the accidents would be innumerable.    The truth is, the horse does very well if managed with a little  common sense, skill, and coolness.    As a matter of law, the automobile is a vehicle, and has precisely  the same rights on the highway that a bicycle or a carriage has.  The horse has no monopoly of the highway, it enjoys no especial  privileges, but must share the road with all other vehicles.  Furthermore, the law makes it the business of the horse to get  accustomed to strange sights and behave itself This duty has been  onerous the last few years; the bicycle, the traction engine, and  the trolley have come along in quick succession; the automobile is  about the last straw.    Until the horse is accustomed to the machine, it is the duty--by  law and common sense--of the automobile driver to take great care  in passing; the care being measured by the possibility and  probability of at accident.    The sympathy of every chauffeur must be entirely with the driver  of the horse. Automobiles are not so numerous in this country that  they may be looked for at every turn, and one cannot but feel for  the man or woman who, while driving, sees one coming down the  road. The best of drivers feel panicky, while women and children  are terror-stricken.    It is no uncommon sight to see people jump out of their carriages  or drive into fields or lanes, anywhere, to get out of the way. In  localities where machines have been driven recklessly, men and  women, though dressed in their best, frequently jump out in the  mud as soon as an automobile comes in sight, and long before the  chauffeur has an opportunity to show that he will exercise caution  in approaching. All this is wrong and creates an amount of  ill-feeling hard to overcome.    If one is driving along a fine road at twenty or thirty miles an  hour, it is, of course, a relief to see coming vehicles turn in  somewhere; but it ought not to be necessary for them to do so.  Often people like to turn to one side for the sake of seeing the  machine go by at full speed; but if they do not wish to, the  automobile should be so driven as to pass with safety.    On country roads there is but one way to pass horses without risk,  and that is let the horses pass the machine.    In cities horses give very little trouble; in the country they  give no end of trouble; they are a very great drawback to the  pleasure of automobiling. Horses that behave well in the city are  often the very worst in the country, so susceptible is the animal  to environment.    On narrow country roads three out of five will behave badly, and  unless the outward signs are unmistakable, it is never safe to  assume one is meeting an old plug,--even the plug sometimes jumps  the ditch.    The safe, the prudent, the courteous thing to do is to stop and  let the driver drive or lead his horse by; if a child or woman is  driving, get out and lead the horse.    By stopping the machine most horses can be gotten by without much  trouble. Even though the driver motions to come on, it is seldom  safe to do so; for of all horses the one that is brought to a  stand-still in front of a machine is surest to shy, turn, or bolt  when the machine starts up to pass. If one is going to pass a  horse without stopping, it is safer to do so quickly,--the more  quickly the better; but that is taking great chances.    Whenever a horse, whether driven or hitched, shows fright, a loud,  sharp \"Whoa!\" from the chauffeur will steady the animal. The voice  from the machine, if sharp and peremptory, is much more effective  than any amount of talking from the carriage.    Much of the prejudice against automobiles is due to the fact that  machines are driven with entire disregard for the feelings and  rights of horse owners; in short, the highway is monopolized to  the exclusion of the public. The prejudice thus created is  manifested in many ways that are disagreeable to the chauffeur and  his friends.    The trouble is not in excessive speed, and speed ordinances will  not remedy the trouble. A machine may be driven as recklessly at  ten or twelve miles an hour as at thirty. In a given distance more  horses can be frightened by a slow machine than a fast. It is all  in the manner of driving.    Speed is a matter of temperament. In England, the people and local  boards cannot adopt measures stringent enough to prevent speeding;  in Ireland, the people and local authorities line the highways,  urging the chauffeur to let his machine out; in America, we are  suspended between English prudence and repression on the one side  and Irish impulsiveness and recklessness on the other.    The Englishman will not budge; the Irishman cries, \"Let her go.\"    Speaking of the future of the automobile, the Professor said,--    \"Cupid will never use the automobile, the little god is too  conservative; fancy the dainty sprite with oil-can and waste  instead of bow and arrow. I can see him with smut on the end of  his mischievous nose and grease on the seat of the place where his  trousers ought to be. What a picture he would make in overalls and  jumper, leather jacket and cap; he could not use dart or arrow, at  best he could only run the machine hither and thither bunting  people into love--knocking them senseless, which is perhaps the  same thing. No, no, Cupid will never use the automobile. Imagine  Aphrodite in goggles, clothed in dust, her fair skin red from  sunburn and glistening with cold cream; horrible nightmare of a  mechanical age, avaunt!    \"The chariots of High Olympus were never greased, they used no  gasoline, the clouds we see about them are condensed zephyrs and  not dust. Omniscient Jove never used a monkey-wrench, never sought  the elusive spark, never blew up a four-inch tire with a half-inch  pump. Even if the automobile could surmount the grades, it would  never be popular on Olympian heights. Mercury might use it to  visit Vulcan, but he would never go far from the shop.    \"As for conditions here on earth, why should a young woman go  riding with a man whose hands, arms, and attention are entirely  taken up with wheels, levers, and oil-cups? He can't even press  her foot without running the risk of stopping the machine by  releasing some clutch; if he moves his knees a hair's-breadth in  her direction it does something to the mechanism; if he looks her  way they are into the ditch; if she attempts to kiss him his  goggles prevent; his sighs are lost in the muffler and hers in the  exhaust; nothing but dire disaster will bring an automobile  courtship to a happy termination; as long as the machine goes  love-making is quite out of the question.    \"Dobbin, dear old secretive Dobbin, what difference does it make  to you whether you feel the guiding hand or not? You know when the  courtship begins, the brisk drives about town to all points of  interest, to the pond, the poorhouse, and the cemetery; you know  how the courtship progresses, the long drives in the country, the  idling along untravelled roads and woodland ways, the moonlight  nights and misty meadows; you know when your stops to nibble by  the wayside will not be noticed, and you alone know when it is  time to get the young couple home; you know, alas! when the  courtship--blissful period of loitering for you--is ended and when  the marriage is made, by the tighter rein, the sharper word, and  the occasional swish of the whip. Ah, Dobbin, you and I--\" The  Professor was becoming indiscreet.    \"What do you know about love-making, Professor?\"    \"My dear fellow, it is the province of learning to know everything  and practise nothing.\"    \"But Dobbin--\"    \"We all have had our Dobbins.\"    For some miles the road out of Erie was soft, dusty,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],[0,"Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#9)"],[1," of life which earns life's crown;    Earns, but not always wins; but he--    The star ascended in his nativity.        The March to the Sea.  (December, 1864.)      Not Kenesaw high-arching,    Nor Allatoona's glen--  Though there the graves lie parching--    Stayed Sherman's miles of men;  From charred Atlanta marching    They launched the sword again.          The columns streamed like rivers            Which in their course agree,          And they streamed until their flashing            Met the flashing of the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              That marching to the sea.    They brushed the foe before them    (Shall gnats impede the bull?);  Their own good bridges bore them    Over swamps or torrents full,  And the grand pines waving o'er them    Bowed to axes keen and cool.          The columns grooved their channels.            Enforced their own decree,          And their power met nothing larger            Until it met the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              A marching glad and free.    Kilpatrick's snare of riders    In zigzags mazed the land,  Perplexed the pale Southsiders    With feints on every hand;  Vague menace awed the hiders    In forts beyond command.          To Sherman's shifting problem            No foeman knew the key;          But onward went the marching            Unpausing to the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              The swinging step was free.    The flankers ranged like pigeons    In clouds through field or wood;  The flocks of all those regions,    The herds and horses good,  Poured in and swelled the legions,    For they caught the marching mood.          A volley ahead! They hear it;            And they hear the repartee:          Fighting was but frolic            In that marching to the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              A marching bold and free.    All nature felt their coming,    The birds like couriers flew,  And the banners brightly blooming    The slaves by thousands drew,  And they marched beside the drumming,    And they joined the armies blue.          The cocks crowed from the cannon            (Pets named from Grant and Lee),          Plumed fighters and campaigners            In the marching to the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              For every man was free.    The foragers through calm lands    Swept in tempest gay,  And they breathed the air of balm-lands    Where rolled savannas lay,  And they helped themselves from farm-lands--    As who should say them nay?          The regiments uproarious            Laughed in Plenty's glee;          And they marched till their broad laughter            Met the laughter of the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              That marching to the sea.    The grain of endless acres    Was threshed (as in the East)  By the trampling of the Takers,    Strong march of man and beast;  The flails of those earth-shakers    Left a famine where they ceased.          The arsenals were yielded;            The sword (that was to be),          Arrested in the forging,            Rued that marching to the sea:              It was glorious glad marching,              But ah, the stern decree!    For behind they left a wailing,    A terror and a ban,  And blazing cinders sailing,    And houseless households wan,  Wide zones of counties paling,    And towns where maniacs ran.          Was it Treason's retribution--            Necessity the plea?          They will long remember Sherman            And his streaming columns free--              They will long remember Sherman              Marching to the sea.        The Frenzy in the Wake.[14]  Sherman's advance through the Carolinas.  (February, 1865.)      So strong to suffer, shall we be    Weak to contend, and break  The sinews of the Oppressor's knee    That grinds upon the neck?      O, the garments rolled in blood        Scorch in cities wrapped in flame,      And the African--the imp!        He gibbers, imputing shame.    Shall Time, avenging every woe,    To us that joy allot  Which Israel thrilled when Sisera's brow    Showed gaunt and showed the clot?      Curse on their foreheads, cheeks, and eyes--        The Northern faces--true      To the flag we hate, the flag whose stars        Like planets strike us through.    From frozen Maine they come,    Far Minnesota too;  They come to a sun whose rays disown--    May it wither them as the dew!      The ghosts of our slain appeal:        \"Vain shall our victories be\"      But back from its ebb the flood recoils--        Back in a whelming sea.    With burning woods our skies are brass,    The pillars of dust are seen;  The live-long day their cavalry pass--    No crossing the road between.      We were sore deceived--an awful host!        They move like a roaring wind.      Have we gamed and lost? but even despair        Shall never our hate rescind.        The Fall of Richmond.  The tidings received in the Northern Metropolis.  (April, 1865.)      What mean these peals from every tower,    And crowds like seas that sway?  The cannon reply; they speak the heart    Of the People impassioned, and say--  A city in flags for a city in flames,    Richmond goes Babylon's way--          _Sing and pray._    O weary years and woeful wars,    And armies in the grave;  But hearts unquelled at last deter  The helmed dilated Lucifer--    Honor to Grant the brave,  Whose three stars now like Orion's rise    When wreck is on the wave--          _Bless his glaive._    Well that the faith we firmly kept,    And never our aim forswore  For the Terrors that trooped from each recess  When fainting we fought in the Wilderness,    And Hell made loud hurrah;  But God is in Heaven, and Grant in the Town,    And Right through might is Law--          _God's way adore._        The Surrender at Appomattox.  (April, 1865.)      As billows upon billows roll,    On victory victory breaks;  Ere yet seven days from Richmond's fall    And crowning triumph wakes  The loud joy-gun, whose thunders run    By sea-shore, streams, and lakes.      The hope and great event agree      In the sword that Grant received from Lee.    The warring eagles fold the wing,    But not in Caesar's sway;  Not Rome o'ercome by Roman arms we sing,    As on Pharsalia's day,  But Treason thrown, though a giant grown,    And Freedom's larger play.      All human tribes glad token see      In the close of the wars of Grant and Lee.        A Canticle:  Significant of the national exaltation of enthusiasm at  the close of the War.      O the precipice Titanic    Of the congregated Fall,  And the angle oceanic    Where the deepening thunders call--      And the Gorge so grim,      And the firmamental rim!  Multitudinously thronging    The waters all converge,  Then they sweep adown in sloping    Solidity of surge.        The Nation, in her impulse        Mysterious as the Tide,      In emotion like an ocean        Moves in power, not in pride;      And is deep in her devotion        As Humanity is wide.            Thou Lord of hosts victorious,            The confluence Thou hast twined;          By a wondrous way and glorious            A passage Thou dost find--            A passage Thou dost find:          Hosanna to the Lord of hosts,            The hosts of human kind.    Stable in its baselessness    When calm is in the air,  The Iris half in tracelessness    Hovers faintly fair.  Fitfully assailing it    A wind from heaven blows,  Shivering and paling it    To blankness of the snows;  While, incessant in renewal,    The Arch rekindled grows,  Till again the gem and jewel    Whirl in blinding overthrows--  Till, prevailing and transcending,    Lo, the Glory perfect there,  And the contest finds an ending,    For repose is in the air.    But the foamy Deep unsounded,    And the dim and dizzy ledge,  And the booming roar rebounded,    And the gull that skims the edge!      The Giant of the Pool      Heaves his forehead white as wool--  Toward the Iris every climbing    From the Cataracts that call--  Irremovable vast arras    Draping all the Wall.        The Generations pouring        From times of endless date,      In their going, in their flowing        Ever form the steadfast State;      And Humanity is growing        Toward the fullness of her fate.            Thou Lord of hosts victorious,            Fulfill the end designed;          By a wondrous way and glorious            A passage Thou dost find--            A passage Thou dost find:          Hosanna to the Lord of hosts,            The hosts of human kind.        The Martyr.  Indicative of the passion of the people on the 15th of  April, 1865.      Good Friday was the day    Of the prodigy and crime,  When they killed him in his pity,    When they killed him in his prime  Of clemency and calm--      When with yearning he was filled      To redeem the evil-willed,  And, though conqueror, be kind;    But they killed him in his kindness,    In their madness and their blindness,  And they killed him from behind.            There is sobbing of the strong,            And a pall upon the land;          But the People in their weeping              Bare the iron hand:          Beware the People weeping            When they bare the iron hand.    He lieth in his blood--    The father in his face;  They have killed him, the Forgiver--    The Avenger takes his place, [15]  The Avenger wisely stern,      Who in righteousness shall do      What the heavens call him to,  And the parricides remand;    For they killed him in his kindness,    In their madness and their blindness,  And his blood is on their hand.            There is sobbing of the strong,            And a pall upon the land;          But the People in their weeping              Bare the iron hand:          Beware the People weeping            When they bare the iron hand.        \"The Coming Storm:\"  A Picture by S.R.
