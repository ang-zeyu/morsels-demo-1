The common people aver that demons reside in these swamps; and, indeed,  at night fiery shapes are seen, which, to the ignorant, are sufficient  confirmation of such tales. The vapour, where it is most dense, takes  fire, like the blue flame of spirits, and these flaming clouds float to  and fro, and yet do not burn the reeds. The superstitious trace in them  the forms of demons and winged fiery serpents, and say that white  spectres haunt the margin of the marsh after dusk. In a lesser degree,  the same thing has taken place with other ancient cities. It is true  that there are not always swamps, but the sites are uninhabitable  because of the emanations from the ruins. Therefore they are avoided.  Even the spot where a single house has been known to have existed, is  avoided by the hunters in the woods.    They say when they are stricken with ague or fever, that they must have  unwittingly slept on the site of an ancient habitation. Nor can the  ground be cultivated near the ancient towns, because it causes fever;  and thus it is that, as I have already stated, the present places of the  same name are often miles distant from the former locality. No sooner  does the plough or the spade turn up an ancient site than those who work  there are attacked with illness. And thus the cities of the old world,  and their houses and habitations, are deserted and lost in the forest.  If the hunters, about to pitch their camp for the night, should stumble  on so much as a crumbling brick or a fragment of hewn stone, they at  once remove at least a bowshot away.    The eastward flow of the Thames being at first checked, and finally  almost or quite stopped by the formation of these banks, the water  turned backwards as it were, and began to cover hitherto dry land. And  this, with the other lesser rivers and brooks that no longer had any  ultimate outlet, accounts for the Lake, so far as this side of the  country is concerned.    At the western extremity the waters also contract between the steep  cliffs called the Red Rocks, near to which once existed the city of  Bristol. Now the Welsh say, and the tradition of those who dwell in that  part of the country bears them out, that in the time of the old world  the River Severn flowed past the same spot, but not between these  cliffs. The great river Severn coming down from the north, with England  on one bank and Wales upon the other, entered the sea, widening out as  it did so. Just before it reached the sea, another lesser river, called  the Avon, the upper part of which is still there, joined it passing  through this cleft in the rocks.    But when the days of the old world ended in the twilight of the  ancients, as the salt ocean fell back and its level became lower, vast  sandbanks were disclosed, which presently extended across the most part  of the Severn river. Others, indeed, think that the salt ocean did not  sink, but that the land instead was lifted higher. Then they say that  the waves threw up an immense quantity of shingle and sand, and that  thus these banks were formed. All that we know with certainty, however,  is, that across the estuary of the Severn there rose a broad barrier of  beach, which grew wider with the years, and still increases westwards.  It is as if the ocean churned up its floor and cast it forth upon the  strand.    Now when the Severn was thus stayed yet more effectually than the  Thames, in the first place it also flowed backwards as it were, till its  overflow mingled with the reflux of the Thames. Thus the inland sea of  fresh water was formed; though Silvester hints (what is most improbable)  that the level of the land sank and formed a basin. After a time, when  the waters had risen high enough, since all water must have an outlet  somewhere, the Lake, passing over the green country behind the Red  Rocks, came pouring through the channel of the Avon.    Then, farther down, it rose over the banks which were lowest there, and  thus found its way over a dam into the sea. Now when the tide of the  ocean is at its ebb, the waters of the Lake rush over these banks with  so furious a current that no vessel can either go down or come up. If  they attempted to go down, they would be swamped by the meeting of the  waves; if they attempted to come up, the strongest gale that blows could  not force them against the stream. As the tide gradually returns,  however, the level of the ocean rises to the level of the Lake, the  outward flow of water ceases, and there is even a partial inward flow of  the tide which, at its highest, reaches to the Red Rocks. At this state  of the tide, which happens twice in a day and night, vessels can enter  or go forth.    The Irish ships, of which I have spoken, thus come into the Lake,  waiting outside the bar till the tide lifts them over. The Irish ships,  being built to traverse the ocean from their country, are large and  stout and well manned, carrying from thirty to fifty men. The Welsh  ships, which come down from that inlet of the Lake which follows the  ancient course of the Severn, are much smaller and lighter, as not being  required to withstand the heavy seas. They carry but fifteen or twenty  men each, but then they are more numerous. The Irish ships, on account  of their size and draught, in sailing about the sweet waters, cannot  always haul on shore at night, nor follow the course of the ships of  burden between the fringe of islands and the strand.    They have often to stay in the outer and deeper waters; but the Welsh  boats come in easily at all parts of the coast, so that no place is safe  against them. The Welsh have ever been most jealous of the Severn, and  will on no account permit so much as a canoe to enter it. So that  whether it be a narrow creek, or whether there be wide reaches, or what  the shores may be like, we are ignorant. And this is all that is with  certainty known concerning the origin of the inland sea of sweet water,  excluding all that superstition and speculation have advanced, and  setting down nothing but ascertained facts.    A beautiful sea it is, clear as crystal, exquisite to drink, abounding  with fishes of every kind, and adorned with green islands. There is  nothing more lovely in the world than when, upon a calm evening, the sun  goes down across the level and gleaming water, where it is so wide that  the eye can but just distinguish a low and dark cloud, as it were,  resting upon the horizon, or perhaps, looking lengthways, cannot  distinguish any ending to the expanse. Sometimes it is blue, reflecting  the noonday sky; sometimes white from the clouds; again green and dark  as the wind rises and the waves roll.    Storms, indeed, come up with extraordinary swiftness, for which reason  the ships, whenever possible, follow the trade route, as it is called,  behind the islands, which shelter them like a protecting reef. They drop  equally quickly, and thus it is not uncommon for the morning to be calm,  the midday raging in waves dashing resistlessly upon the beach, and the  evening still again. The Irish, who are accustomed to the salt ocean,  say, in the suddenness of its storms and the shifting winds, it is more  dangerous than the sea itself. But then there are almost always islands,  behind which a vessel can be sheltered.    Beneath the surface of the Lake there must be concealed very many  ancient towns and cities, of which the names are lost. Sometimes the  anchors bring up even now fragments of rusty iron and old metal, or  black beams of timber. It is said, and with probability, that when the  remnant of the ancients found the water gradually encroaching (for it  rose very slowly), as they were driven back year by year, they  considered that in time they would be all swept away and drowned. But  after extending to its present limits the Lake rose no farther, not even  in the wettest seasons, but always remains the same. From the position  of certain quays we know that it has thus remained for the last hundred  years at least.    Never, as I observed before, was there so beautiful an expanse of water.  How much must we sorrow that it has so often proved only the easiest  mode of bringing the miseries of war to the doors of the unoffending!  Yet men are never weary of sailing to and fro upon it, and most of the  cities of the present time are upon its shore. And in the evening we  walk by the beach, and from the rising grounds look over the waters, as  if to gaze upon their loveliness were reward to us for the labour of the  day.            Part II    WILD ENGLAND        CHAPTER I    SIR FELIX      On a bright May morning, the sunlight, at five o'clock, was pouring into  a room which face the east at the ancestral home of the Aquilas. In this  room Felix, the eldest of the three sons of the Baron, was sleeping. The  beams passed over his head, and lit up a square space on the opposite  whitewashed wall, where, in the midst of the brilliant light, hung an  ivory cross. There were only two panes of glass in the window, each no  more than two or three inches square, the rest of the window being  closed by strong oaken shutters, thick enough to withstand the stroke of  an arrow.    In the daytime one of these at least would have been thrown open to  admit air and light. They did not quite meet, and a streak of sunshine,  in addition to that which came through the tiny panes, entered at the  chink. Only one window in the house contained more than two such panes  (it was in the Baroness's sitting-room), and most of them had none at  all. The glass left by the ancients in their dwellings had long since  been used up or broken, and the fragments that remained were too  precious to be put in ordinary rooms. When larger pieces were  discovered, they were taken for the palaces of the princes, and even  these were but sparingly supplied, so that the saying \"he has glass in  his window\" was equivalent to \"he belongs to the upper ranks\".

To the cross-piece that holds the axle of the drums the inventors have  added (Fig. 5) a support formed of a strip of brass, S, with whose  extremity is jointed (at the lower part) a double lever, A. This latter is  held in a horizontal position by a small counterpoise, _i_, so that the  finger at the opposite extremity shall prevent the pendulum, P, from  swinging. To keep the latter in a position of rest a bent lever, _n n'_,  is jointed to the upper part of the support, S. The longer arm, _n'_, of  this lever is bent forward at right angles, so that it may come into  contact with and repel the small rod of the pendulum as soon as the lever  has been lifted by means of a small cord which is connected with the  larger arm, _n_, and runs up to a small hook, from whence it descends and  makes its exit under the clock-case.    In order to stop the clock, then, it is only necessary to pull on this  cord slightly, when, by moving the pendulum to the left, it will thrust  it against the inclined plane of the finger of the lever arm, A. It is  clear that the extremity of the pendulum, upon striking against the  finger, will depress it slightly and go beyond the projection against  which it remains fixed owing to the counterpoise, _i_. The fever, _n n'_,  is brought back to its position of rest by means of a small counterpoise  at the extremity of the arm, _n_. When the lever, A, is depressed, the  pendulum escapes and sets the clock running. This depression is effected  by means of an electro-magnet, E, whose armature, which is connected with  the rod, _t, t_, lifts the arm, _i_, of the lever, and depresses A. The  wires of the two bobbins of the electro-magnet end in two clamps, 1 and 2.  The second of these latter is insulated from the clock-case. Both  communicate with the extremities of the circuit in which is interposed the  seismic telltale that brings about a closing of the current. Having noted  the position of the hands on the dial when the clock was running, one can  deduce therefrom the moment at which the shock occurred that set the clock  in motion.    In addition to the parts that we have described, there are other accessory  ones, R R_r_, and a third clamp, 3, which constitute a sort of rheotome  that is designed to keep the circuit closed after the momentary closing  that is produced by the telltale has occurred. This little mechanism is  indispensable when the disturbed telltale has also to act upon an electric  bell. This rheotome, which is very simple, is constructed as follows: A  small brass rod, R, which is screwed to the support, S, carries at its  left extremity a brass axis, X, which is insulated from the rod, R, by  means of an ivory piece. Toward the center of this small rod, the bent  lever, _r_, carries a small arm that is bent forward, and against which  abuts the axis of the pendulum, thus causing it to be thrust toward the  left when the pendulum is arrested by the projection of the finger, A. As  soon as the pendulum is set free, the lever, _r_, redescends and places  itself against the axis, X. This latter communicates with clamp 3, which  is insulated, while the rod, R, communicates with clamp 1. The external  communications are so arranged that the circuit in which the bell is  interposed remains definitely closed when the lever, _r_, is in contact  with the rod, X.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--ROSSI'S TREMITOSCOPE.]    _Rossi's Tremitoscope._--This instrument (Fig. 6) unites, upon the same  stone base, three different arrangements for showing evidences of  trepidations of the earth. On one side we find (protected by a glass tube)  a weight suspended over a mercury cup by a spring, and designed to show  vertical motions. The two other parts of the apparatus are designed for  registering horizontal motions. The first is a pendulum which causes a  contact with four distinct springs, and whose movements are watched with a  spy-glass. The second is a steel spring which carries at its upper part a  heavy ball that vibrates at the least shock. This ball is provided with a  point which is movable within a second ball, so that its motion produces  a contact. All these different contacts are signaled or registered  electrically.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--SCATENI'S SEISMOGRAPH.]    _Scateni's Registering Seismograph._--This apparatus, which is shown in  Figs. 7 and 8, consists of two parts--of a transmitter and of a  registering device.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--REGISTERING APPARATUS.]    The transmitter consists of a glass vessel supported upon a steel point  and provided beneath with a platinum circle connected with a pile. All  around this circle are four strips of platinum, against one of which abuts  the circle at every movement of the glass. Each strip of platinum  communicates, through a special wire, with one of the electro-magnets of  the registering device (Fig. 8). This latter consists of an ordinary clock  that carries three concentric dials--one for minutes, one for hours, and  one for seconds. In a direction with the radii of these dials there are  four superposed levers, each of which is actuated by one of the electros.  On another hand, each dial is divided into four zones that correspond to  the four cardinal points. When a shock coming from the north, for example,  produces a contact, the corresponding electro is affected, and its lever  falls and marks upon each of the dials a point in its north zone. We thus  obtain the exact hour of the shock, as well as its direction. As may be  seen, the apparatus, as regards principle, is one of the simplest of its  kind.--_La Lumiere Electrique._           *       *       *       *       *          NEW ACCUMULATORS.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.--ARNOULD & TAMINE'S ACCUMULATOR.]    In Messrs. Arnould and Tamine's accumulators, shown in Fig. 1, the  formation is effected directly by the current, as in the Plante pile, but  the plates are formed of wires connected horizontally at their extremities  by soldering. These plates are held apart either by setting them into  paraffined wooden grooves at the ends of the trough or by interposing  between them pieces of paraffined wood.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--BARRIER & TOURVIELLE'S ELECTRODOCK.]    In Messrs. Barrier and Tourville's _Electrodock_ (Fig. 2) the plates are  formed of concentric leaden tubes fixed into a wooden cover. These tubes  are threaded internally and externally, and the grooves thus produced are  filled with a peculiar cement composed of litharge, powdered charcoal, and  permanganate of potash, triturated together, sifted, and then mixed with  glucose or sugar sirup so as to make a paste of them. This mixture forms a  cement that is very adhesive after, as well as before, the electrolytic  action.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--KORNBLUH'S ACCUMULATOR.]    In Kornbluh's accumulators the plates consist of ribbed leaden gratings  between which is compressed red lead prepared in a peculiar manner, and  constituting, 48 hours after formation, a compact mass with the lead. The  tangs of the plates are widened so as to touch one another while leaving a  proper distance between the plates themselves, and are hollowed out for  the reception of a rod provided at its extremities with a winged nut and  jam nut for passing them up close to one another. The plates, properly so  called, are held apart by rubber bauds. The glass vessels are placed in  osier baskets.--_La Lumiere Electrique._           *       *       *       *       *          INDUSTRIAL MODEL OF THE REYNIER ZINC ACCUMULATOR.      The three models of a secondary battery that I recently made known to the  readers of this journal have been the object of continuous experiment.  Conformably to the provisions of theory, the zinc accumulator has shown  itself practically superior to the two others, and I have therefore chosen  this type for getting up an industrial model, which is shown in the  annexed cut. The accumulator contains four Plante positives, having a wide  surface, and three negatives constructed of smooth sheets of lead covered  with zinc by the electrolysis of the acidulated solution of zinc sulphate  in which the couple is immersed. Accidental contact with the interior of  the pile is prevented by glass tubes fixed to the negatives by means of  leaden bands. The seven electrodes are carried by as many distinct  crosspieces of paraffined wood, which rest upon the edges of the trough  and hold the plates at a certain distance from the bottom. These various  crosspieces, which touch one another, take the place of a cover. Each  plate is provided with a terminal. The four positive terminals are all on  the same side, and the three negatives are on the opposite side. Two brass  rods ending in a wire-clamp connect the respective terminals of the same  name. The trough consists of two oblong wooden receptacles, one within the  other, and having a play of several millimeters. This space is lined with  a tight, elastic, insulating cement having tar for a base.    [Illustration: REYNIER'S ZINC ACCUMULATOR. (One-fifth actual size.)]    The careful insulation of the trough and all parts of the apparatus, and  the purity of the metal and its amalgamation, reduce the local attack of  the zinc to almost nothing. So the coefficient of restitution is now  comparable with that of accumulators of the Plante type.    The following are the principal numerical data of the new zinc  accumulator.
