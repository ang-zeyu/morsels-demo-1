For example in  expendo, spend; exemplum, sample; excipio, scape; extraneus, strange;  extractum, stretch'd; excrucio, to screw; exscorio, to scour; excorio, to  scourge; excortico, to scratch; and others beginning with ex: as also,  emendo, to mend; episcopus, bishop, in Danish bisp; epistola, epistle;  hospitale, spittle; Hispania, Spain; historia, story.        Many of these etymologies are doubtful, and some evidently mistaken.        The following are somewhat harder, Alexander, Sander; Elisabetha,      Betty; apis, bee; aper, bar; p passing into b, as in bishop; and by      cutting off a from the beginning, which is restored in the middle; but      for the old bar or bare, we now say boar; as for lang, long, for bain,      bane; for stane, stone; aprugna, brawn, p, being changed into b and a      transposed, as in aper, and g changed into w, as in pignus, pawn; lege,      law; [Greek: alopex], fox, cutting off the beginning, and changing p      into f, as in pellis, a fell; pullus, a foal; pater, father; pavor,      fear; polio, file; pleo, impleo, fill, full; piscis, fish; and      transposing o into the middle, which was taken from the beginning;      apex, a piece; peak, pike; zophorus, freese; mustum, stum; defensio,      fence; dispensator, spencer; asculto, escouter, Fr. scout; exscalpo,      scrape; restoring l instead of r, and hence scrap, scrabble, scrawl;      exculpo, scoop; exterritus, start; extonitus, attonitus, stonn'd;      stomachus, maw; offendo, fined; obstipo, stop; audere, dare; cavere,      ware; whence, a-ware, beware, wary, warn, warning; for the Latin v      consonant formerly sounded like our w, and the modern sound of the v      consonant was formerly that of the letter f, that is, the AEolick      digamma, which had the sound of [Greek: ph], and the modern sound of      the letter f was that of the Greek [Greek: ph] or ph; ulcus, ulcere,      ulcer, sore, and hence sorry, sorrow, sorrowful; ingenium, engine, gin,      scalenus, leaning, unless you would rather derive it from [Greek:      klino], whence inclino; infundibulum, funnel; gagates, jett, projectum,      to jett forth, a jetty; cucullus, a cowl.        There are syncopes somewhat harder; from tempore, time; from nomine,      name, domina, dame; as the French homme, femme, nom, from homine,      foemina, nomine. Thus pagina, page; [Greek: poterion], pot; [Greek:      kypella], cup; cantharus, can; tentorium, tent; precor, pray; preda,      prey; specio, speculor, spy; plico, ply; implico, imply; replico,      reply; complico, comply; sedes episcopalis, see.        A vowel is also cut off in the middle, that the number of the syllables      may be lessened; as amita, aunt; spiritus, spright; debitum, debt;      dubito, doubt; comes, comitis, count; clericus, clerk; quietus, quit,      quite; acquieto, to acquit; separo, to spare; stabilis, stable;      stabulum, stable; pallacium, palace, place; rabula, rail, rawl, wrawl,      brawl, rable, brable; quaesito, quest.        As also a consonant, or at least one of a softer sound, or even a whole      syllable, rotundus, round; fragilis, frail; securus, sure; regula,      rule; tegula, tile; subtilis, subtle; nomen, noun; decanus, dean;      computo, count; subitaneus, sudden, soon; superare, to soar; periculum,      peril; mirabile, marvel; as magnus, main; dignor, deign; tingo, stain;      tinctum, taint; pingo, paint; praedari, reach.        The contractions may seem harder, where many of them meet, as [Greek:      kyriakos], kyrk, church; presbyter, priest; sacristanus, sexton;      frango, fregi, break, breach; fagus, [Greek: phega], beech, f changed      into b, and g into ch, which are letters near akin; frigesco, freeze,      frigesco, fresh, sc into sh, as above in bishop, fish, so in scapha,      skiff, skip, and refrigesco, refresh; but viresco, fresh; phlebotamus,      fleam; bovina, beef; vitulina, veal; scutifer, squire; poenitentia,      penance; sanctuarium, sanctuary, sentry; quaesitio, chase; perquisitio,      purchase; anguilla, eel; insula, isle, ile, island, iland; insuletta,      islet, ilet, eyght, and more contractedly ey, whence Owsney, Ruley,      Ely; examinare, to scan; namely, by rejecting from the beginning and      end e and o, according to the usual manner, the remainder xamin, which      the Saxons, who did not use x, writ csamen, or scamen, is contracted      into scan: as from dominus, don; nomine, noun; abomino, ban; and indeed      apum examen; they turned into sciame; for which we say swarme, by      inserting r to denote the murmuring; thesaurus, store; sedile, stool;      [Greek: hyetos], wet; sudo, sweat; gaudium, gay; jocus, joy; succus,      juice; catena, chain; caliga, calga; chause, chausse, French, hose;      extinguo, stand, squench, quench, stint; foras, forth; species, spice;      recito, read; adjuvo, aid; [Greek: aion], aevum, ay, age, ever; floccus,      lock; excerpo, scrape, scrabble, scrawl; extravagus, stray, straggle;      collectum, clot, clutch; colligo, coil: recolligo, recoil; severo,      swear; stridulus, shrill; procurator, proxy; pulso, to push; calamus, a      quill; impetere, to impeach; augeo, auxi, wax; and vanesco, vanui,      wane; syllabare, to spell; puteus, pit; granum, corn; comprimo, cramp,      crump, crumple, crinkle.        Some may seem harsher, yet may not be rejected, for it at least      appears, that some of them are derived from proper names, and there are      others whose etymology is acknowledged by every body; as, Alexander,      Elick, Scander, Sander, Sandy, Sanny; Elizabetha, Elizabeth, Elisabeth,      Betty, Bess; Margareta, Margaret, Marget, Meg, Peg; Maria, Mary, Mal,      Pal, Malkin, Mawkin, Mawkes; Mathaeus, Mattha, Matthew; Martha, Mat,      Pat; Gulielmus, Wilhelmus, Girolamo, Guillaume, William, Will, Bill,      Wilkin, Wicken, Wicks, Weeks.        Thus cariophyllus, flos; gerofilo, Italian, giriflee, gilofer, French,      gilliflower, which the vulgar call julyflower, as if derived from the      month July; petroselinum, parsley; portulaca, purslain; cydonium,      quince; cydoniatum, quiddeny; persicum, peach; eruca, eruke, which they      corrupt to earwig, as if it took its name from the ear; annulus      geminus, a gimmal, or gimbal-ring; and thus the word gimbal or jumbal      is transferred to other things thus interwoven; quelques choses,      kickshaws. Since the origin of these, and many others, however forced,      is evident, it ought to appear no wonder to any one if the ancients      have thus disfigured many, especially as they so much affected      monosyllables; and, to make the sound the softer, took this liberty of      maiming, taking away, changing, transposing, and softening them.        But while we derive these from the Latin, I do not mean to say, that      many of them did not immediately come to us from the Saxon, Danish,      Dutch, and Teutonick languages, and other dialects; and some taken more      lately from the French or Italians, or Spaniards.        The same word, according to its different significations, often has a      different origin; as, to bear a burden, from fero; but to bear, whence      birth, born, bairn, comes from pario; and a bear, at least if it be of      Latin original, from fera. Thus perch, a fish, from perca; but perch, a      measure, from pertica, and likewise to perch. To spell is from syllaba;      but spell, an inchantment, by which it is believed that the boundaries      are so fixed in lands that none can pass them against the master's      will, from expello; and spell, a messenger, from epistola; whence      gospel, good-spell, or god-spell. Thus freese, or freeze, from      frigesco; but freeze, an architectonick word, from zophorus; but      freeze, for cloth, from Frisia, or perhaps from frigesco, as being more      fit than any other for keeping out the cold.        There are many words among us, even monosyllables, compounded of two or      more words, at least serving instead of compounds, and comprising the      signification of more words that one; as, from scrip and roll comes      scroll; from proud and dance, prance; from st of the verb stay or stand      and out, is made stout; from stout and hardy, sturdy; from sp of spit      or spew, and out, comes spout; from the same sp with the termination      in, is spin; and adding out, spin out: and from the same sp, with it,      is spit, which only differs from spout in that it is smaller, and with      less noise and force; but sputter is, because of the obscure u,      something between spit and spout: and by reason of adding r, it      intimates a frequent iteration and noise, but obscurely confused;      whereas spatter, on account of the sharper and clearer vowel a,      intimates a more distinct poise, in which it chiefly differs from      sputter. From the same sp and the termination ark, comes spark,      signifying a single emission of fire with a noise; namely sp, the      emission, ar, the more acute noise, and k, the mute consonant,      intimates its being suddenly terminated; but adding l, is made the      frequentative sparkle. The same sp, by adding r, that is spr, implies a      more lively impetus of diffusing or expanding itself; to which adding      the termination ing, it becomes spring: its vigour spr imports; its      sharpness the termination ing; and lastly in acute and tremulous,      ending in the mute consonant g, denotes the sudden ending of any      motion, that it is meant in its primary signification, of a single, not      a complicated exilition. Hence we call spring whatever has an elastick      force; as also a fountain of water,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#9)"],[1,"passage from Rio to the Cape--Account of the Harbours there--The  Cape of Good Hope not the most Southern point--Height of Table Mountain  and others--Supineness of the European nations in neglecting to occupy the  Cape--Live stock laid in--Departure--Separation of the fleet--Arrival of the  Supply at Botany Bay.    4 September 1787    A Prosperous course by sea, like a state of profound peace and  tranquility in civil society, though most advantageous to those who enjoy  it, is unfavourable to the purposes of narration. The striking facts  which the writer exerts himself to record, and the reader is eager to  peruse, arise only from difficult situations: uniform prosperity is  described in very few words. Of this acceptable but unproductive kind was  the passage of the Botany Bay fleet from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of  Good Hope; uniformly favourable, and not marked by any extraordinary  incidents. This run, from about lat. 22 deg. south, long. 43 west of London,  to lat. 34 deg. south, long. 18 deg. east of London, a distance of about four  thousand miles, was performed in thirty-nine days: for having left Rio on  the 4th of September, on the 13th of October the ships came to anchor in  Table Bay. Here they were to take their final refreshment, and lay in  every kind of stock with which they were not already provided. In this  period no additional lives had been lost, except that of a single convict  belonging to the Charlotte transport, who fell accidentally into the sea,  and could not by any efforts be recovered.    13 October 1787    Table Bay, on the north-west side of the Cape of Good Hope, is named from  the Table Mountain, a promontory of considerable elevation, at the foot  of which, and almost in the centre of the Bay, stands Cape Town, the  principal Dutch settlement in this territory. This Bay cannot properly be  called a port, being by no means a station of security; it is exposed to  all the violence of the winds which set into it from the sea; and is far  from sufficiently secured from those which blow from the land. The gusts  which descend from the summit of Table Mountain are sufficient to force  ships from their anchors, and even violently to annoy persons on the  shore, by destroying any tents or other temporary edifices which may be  erected, and raising clouds of fine dust, which produce very troublesome  effects. A gale of this kind, from the south-east, blew for three days  successively when Capt. Cook lay here in his first voyage, at which time,  he informs us, the Resolution was the only ship in the harbour that had  not dragged her anchors. The storms from the sea are still more  formidable; so much so, that ships have frequently been driven by them  from their anchorage, and wrecked at the head of the Bay. But these  accidents happen chiefly in the quaade mousson, or winter months, from  May 14 to the same day of August; during which time few ships venture to  anchor here. Our fleet, arriving later, lay perfectly unmolested as long  as it was necessary for it to remain in this station.    False Bay, on the south-east side of the Cape, is more secure than Table  Bay, during the prevalence of the north-west winds, but still less so in  strong gales from the south-east. It is however less frequented, being  twenty-four miles of very heavy road distant from Cape Town, whence  almost all necessaries must be procured. The most sheltered part of False  Bay is a recess on the west side, called Simon's Bay.    The Cape of Good Hope, though popularly called, and perhaps pretty  generally esteemed so, is not in truth the most southern point of Africa.  The land which projects furthest to the south is a point to the east of  it, called by the English Cape Lagullus; a name corrupted from the  original Portugueze das Agulhas, which, as well as the French appellation  des Aiguilles, is descriptive of its form, and would rightly be  translated Needle Cape. Three eminences, divided by very narrow passes,  and appearing in a distant view like three summits of the same mountain,  stand at the head of Table Bay.--They are however of different heights, by  which difference, as well as by that of their shape, they may be  distinguished. Table Mountain is so called from its appearance, as it  terminates in a flat horizontal surface, from which the face of the rock  descends almost perpendicularly. This mountain rises to about 3567 feet  above the level of the sea. Devil's Head, called also Charles mountain,  is situated to the east of the former, and is not above 3368 feet in  height; and on the west side of Table Mountain, Lion's Head, whose name  is also meant to be descriptive, does not exceed 2764 feet. In the  neighbourhood of the latter lies Constantia, a district consisting of two  farms, wherein the famous wines of that name are produced.    Our voyagers found provisions less plentiful and less reasonable in price  at Cape Town than they had been taught to expect. Board and lodging,  which are to be had only in private houses, stood the officers in two  rix-dollars a day, which is near nine shillings sterling. This town, the  only place in the whole colony to which that title can be applied with  propriety, is of no great extent; it does not in any part exceed two  miles: and the country, colonized here by the Dutch, is in general so  unfavourable to cultivation, that it is not without some astonishment  that we find them able to raise provisions from it in sufficient  abundance to supply themselves, and the ships of so many nations which  constantly resort to the Cape.    When we consider the vast advantages derived by the Dutch colonists from  this traffic, and the almost indispensible necessity by which navigators  of all nations are driven to seek refreshment there, it cannot but appear  extraordinary, that from the discovery of the Cape in 1493, by Barthelemi  Diaz, to the year 1650, when, at the suggestion of John Van Riebeck, the  first Dutch colony was sent, a spot so very favourable to commerce and  navigation should have remained unoccupied by Europeans. Perhaps all the  perseverance of the Dutch character was necessary even to suggest the  idea of maintaining an establishment in a soil so burnt by the sun, and  so little disposed to repay the toil of the cultivator. The example and  success of this people may serve, however, as an useful instruction to  all who in great undertakings are deterred by trifling obstacles; and  who, rather than contend with difficulties, are inclined to relinquish  the most evident advantages.    But though the country near the Cape had not charms enough to render it  as pleasing as that which surrounds Rio de Janeiro, yet the Governor,  Mynheer Van Graaffe, was not far behind the Viceroy of Brazil in  attention to the English officers. They were admitted to his table, where  they were elegantly entertained, and had reason to be pleased in all  respects with his behaviour and disposition. Yet the minds of his people  were not at this time in a tranquil state; the accounts from Holland were  such as occasioned much uneasiness, and great preparations were making at  the fort, from apprehension of a rupture with some other power.    In the course of a month, the live stock and other provisions were  procured; and the ships, having on board not less than five hundred  animals of different kinds, but chiefly poultry, put on an appearance  which naturally enough excited the idea of Noah's ark. This supply,  considering that the country had previously suffered from a dearth, was  very considerable; but it was purchased of course at a higher expence  considerably than it would have been in a time of greater plenty.    12 November 1787    On the 12th of November the fleet set sail, and was for many days much  delayed by strong winds from the south-east.    25 November 1787    On the 25th, being then only 80 leagues to the eastward of the Cape,  Governor Phillip left the Sirius and went on board the Supply tender;  in hopes, by leaving the convoy, to gain sufficient time for examining  the country round Botany Bay, so as to fix on the situation most  eligible for the colony, before the transports should arrive. At the  same time he ordered the agents for the transports, who were in the  Alexander, to separate themselves from the convoy with that ship,  the Scarborough and Friendship, which, as they were better sailors  than the rest, might reasonably be expected sooner: in which case,  by the labour of the convicts they had on board, much might be done  in making the necessary preparations for landing the provisions and  stores.    Major Ross, the Commandant of Marines, now left the Sirius, and went on  board the Scarborough, that he might accompany that part of the  detachment which probably would be landed first. Captain Hunter, in the  Sirius, was to follow with the store-ships, and the remainder of the  transports; and he had the necessary instructions for his future  proceedings, in case the Supply had met with any accident. Lieutenant  Gidley King, since appointed Commandant of Norfolk Island, accompanied  Governor Phillip in the Supply.    3 January 1788    From this time to the 3d of January, 1788, the winds were as favourable  as could be wished, blowing generally in very strong gales from the  north-west, west, and south-west. Once only the wind had shifted to the  east, but continued in that direction not more than a few hours. Thus  assisted, the Supply, which sailed but very indifferently, and turned  out, from what she had suffered in the voyage, to be hardly a safe  conveyance, performed in fifty-one days a voyage of more than seven  thousand miles. On the day abovementioned she was within sight of the  coast of New South Wales. But the winds then became variable, and a  current, which at times set very strongly to the southward, so much  impeded her course, that it was not till the 18th that she arrived at  Botany Bay.
