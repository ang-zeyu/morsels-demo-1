They should also remember that different persons have  different ideas on the subject of enjoyment, and that the surest way  of making a guest happy is to find out what gives her pleasure; not to  impose that upon her which is pleasure to themselves.    A visitor should avoid giving unnecessary trouble to the servants of  the house, and should be liberal to them on leaving.    The signal for retiring to rest is generally given by the appearance  of the servant with wine, water, and biscuits, where a late  dinner-hour is observed and suppers are not the custom. This is the  last refreshment of the evening, and the visitor will do well to  rise and wish good-night shortly after it has been partaken of by the  family.           *       *       *       *       *    XII.--GENERAL HINTS.      Do not frequently repeat the name of the person with whom you are  conversing. It implies either the extreme of _hauteur_ or familiarity.  We have already cautioned you against the repetition of titles.  Deference can always be better expressed in the voice, manner, and  countenance than in any forms of words.    Never speak of absent persons by only their christian or surnames; but  always as Mr. ---- or Mrs. ----. Above all, never name anybody by the  first letter of his name. Married people are sometimes guilty of this  flagrant offence against taste.    No lady should permit any gentleman who is not a near relative, or  very old friend of her family, to defray the cost of her entrance  fee to any theatre or exhibition, or to pay for her refreshments or  vehicles when she happens to be out under his protection.    If a person of greater age or higher rank than yourself desires you  to step first into a carriage, or through a door, it is more polite to  bow and obey than to decline.    Compliance with, and deference to, the wishes of others is the finest  breeding.    When you cannot agree with the propositions advanced in general  conversation, be silent. If pressed for your opinion, give it with  modesty. Never defend your own views too warmly. When you find others  remain unconvinced, drop the subject, or lead to some other topic.    Look at those who address you.    Never boast of your birth, your money, your grand friends, or  anything that is yours. If you have travelled, do not introduce that  information into your conversation at every opportunity. Any one can  travel with money and leisure. The real distinction is to come home  with enlarged views, improved tastes, and a mind free from prejudice.    If you present a book to a friend, do not write his or her name in  it, unless requested. You have no right to presume that it will be  rendered any the more valuable for that addition; and you ought not to  conclude beforehand that your gift will be accepted.    Never undervalue the gift which you are yourself offering; you have no  business to offer it if it is valueless. Neither say that you do not  want it yourself, or that you should throw it away if it were not  accepted, &c., &c. Such apologies would be insults if true, and mean  nothing if false.    No compliment that bears insincerity on the face of it is a compliment  at all.    Unmarried ladies may not accept presents from gentlemen who are  neither related nor engaged to them. Presents made by a married lady  to a gentleman can only be offered in the joint names of her husband  and herself.    Married ladies may occasionally accept presents from gentlemen who  visit frequently at their houses, and who desire to show their sense  of the hospitality which they receive there.    There is an art and propriety in the giving of presents which it  requires a natural delicacy of disposition rightly to apprehend. You  must not give too rich a gift, nor too poor a gift. You must not give  to one much wealthier than yourself; and you must beware how you give  to one much poorer, lest you offend her pride. You must never make  a present with any expectation of a return; and you must not be too  eager to make a return yourself, when you accept one. A gift must not  be ostentatious, but it should be worth offering. On the other hand,  mere costliness does not constitute the soul of a present.    A gift should be precious for something better than its price. It may  have been brought by the giver from some far or famous place; it may  be unique in its workmanship; it may be valuable only from association  with some great man or strange event. Autographic papers, foreign  curiosities, and the like, are elegant gifts. An author may offer his  book, or a painter a sketch, with grace and propriety. Offerings of  flowers and game are unexceptionable, and may be made even to those  whose position is superior to that of the giver.    Never refuse a present unless under very exceptional circumstances.  However humble the giver, and however poor the gift, you should  appreciate the goodwill and intention, and accept it with kindness and  thanks. Never say \"I fear I rob you,\" or \"I am really ashamed to  take it,\" &c., &c. Such deprecatory phrases imply that you think the  bestower of the gift cannot spare or afford it.    Acknowledge the receipt of a present without delay.    Give a foreigner his name in full, as Monsieur de Vigny--never as  _Monsieur_ only. In speaking of him, give him his title, if he has  one. Foreign noblemen are addressed _viva voce_ as Monsieur. In  speaking of a foreign nobleman before his face, say Monsieur le Comte,  or Monsieur le Marquis. In his absence, say Monsieur le Comte de  Vigny.    Converse with a foreigner in his own language. If not competent to do  so, apologize, and beg permission to speak English.    To get in and out of a carriage gracefully is a simple but important  accomplishment. If there is but one step, and you are going to take  your seat facing the horses, put your left foot on the step, and enter  the carriage with your right, in such a manner as to drop at once  into your seat. If you are about to sit with your back to the horses,  reverse the process. As you step into the carriage, be careful to keep  your back towards the seat you are about to occupy, so as to avoid the  awkwardness of turning when you are once in.    Members of one family should not converse together in society.          Etiquette for Gentlemen.           *       *       *       *       *    I.--INTRODUCTIONS.      To introduce persons who are mutually unknown is to undertake a  serious responsibility, and to certify to each the respectability of  the other. Never undertake this responsibility without in the first  place asking yourself whether the persons are likely to be agreeable  to each other; nor, in the second place, without ascertaining whether  it will be acceptable to both parties to become acquainted.    Always introduce the gentleman to the lady--never the lady to  the gentleman. The chivalry of etiquette assumes that the lady is  invariably the superior in right of her sex, and that the gentleman  is honoured in the introduction. This rule is to be observed even when  the social rank of the gentleman is higher than that of the lady.    Where the sexes are the same, always present the inferior to the  superior.    Never present a gentleman to a lady without first asking her  permission to do so.    When you are introduced to a lady, never offer your hand. When  introduced, persons limit their recognition of each other to a bow.  On the Continent, ladies never shake hands with gentlemen unless under  circumstances of great intimacy.    Never introduce morning visitors who happen to encounter each other  in your rooms, unless they are persons whom you have already obtained  permission to make known to each other. Visitors thus casually meeting  in the house of a friend should converse with ease and freedom, as if  they were acquainted. That they are both friends of the hostess is a  sufficient guarantee of their respectability. To be silent and stiff  on such an occasion would show much ignorance and ill-breeding.    Persons who have met at the house of a mutual friend without being  introduced should not bow if they afterwards meet elsewhere. A bow  implies acquaintance; and persons who have not been introduced are not  acquainted.    If you are walking with one friend, and presently meet with, or  are joined by, a third, do not commit the too frequent error of  introducing them to each other. You have even less right to do so than  if they encountered each other at your house during a morning call.    There are some exceptions to the etiquette of introductions. At a  ball, or evening party where there is dancing, the mistress of the  house may introduce any gentleman to any lady without first asking the  lady's permission. But she should first ascertain whether the lady is  willing to dance; and this out of consideration for the gentleman,  who may otherwise be refused. No man likes to be refused the hand of a  lady, though it be only for a quadrille.    A brother may present his sister, or a father his son, without any  kind of preliminary; but only when there is no inferiority on the part  of his own family to that of the acquaintance.    Friends may introduce friends at the house of a mutual acquaintance;  but, as a rule, it is better to be introduced by the mistress of the  house. Such an introduction carries more authority with it.    Introductions at evening parties are now almost wholly dispensed with.  Persons who meet at a friend's house are ostensibly upon an equality,  and pay a bad compliment to the host by appearing suspicious and  formal. Some old-fashioned country hosts yet persevere in introducing  each new comer to all the assembled guests. It is a custom that  cannot be too soon abolished, and one that places the last unfortunate  visitor in a singularly awkward position. All that he can do is to  make a semicircular bow, like a concert singer before an audience, and  bear the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12428"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#9)"],[1,"years to the study of the English law, that he might  the better advocate the cause of these miserable people. The result of  these studies was the publication of a book in the year 1769, which he  called \"A Representation of the Injustice and dangerous Tendency of  Tolerating Slavery in England.\" In this work he refuted, in the clearest  manner, the opinion of York and Talbot. He produced against it the opinion  of the Lord Chief Justice Holt, who many years before had determined, that  every slave coming into England became free. He attacked and refuted it  again by a learned and laborious inquiry into all the principles of  Villenage. He refuted it again, by showing it to be an axiom in the British  constitution, \"That every man in England was free to sue for and defend his  rights, and that force could not be used without a legal process,\" leaving  it to the judges to determine, whether an African was a man. He attacked,  also, the opinion of Judge Blackstone, and showed where his error lay. This  valuable book, containing these and other kinds of arguments on the  subject, he distributed, but particularly among the lawyers, giving them an  opportunity of refuting or acknowledging the doctrines it contained.    While Mr. Sharp was engaged in this work, another case offered, in which he  took a part. This was in the year 1768. Hylas, an African slave, prosecuted  a person of the name of Newton for having kidnapped his wife, and sent her  to the West Indies. The result of the trial was, that damages to the amount  of a shilling were given, and the defendant was bound to bring back the  woman, either by the first ship, or in six months from this decision of the  court.    But soon after the work just mentioned was out, and when Mr. Sharp was  better prepared, a third case occurred. This happened in the year 1770.  Robert Stapylton, who lived at Chelsea, in conjunction with John Malony and  Edward Armstrong, two watermen, seized the person of Thomas Lewis, an  African slave, in a dark night, and dragged him to a boat lying in the  Thames; they then gagged him, and tied him with a cord, and rowed him down  to a ship, and put him on board to be sold as a slave in Jamaica. This base  action took place near the garden of Mrs. Banks, the mother of the present  Sir Joseph Banks. Lewis, it appears, on being seized, screamed violently.  The servants of Mrs. Banks, who heard his cries, ran to his assistance, but  the boat was gone. On informing their mistress of what had happened, she  sent for Mr. Sharp, who began now to be known as the friend of the helpless  Africans, and professed her willingness to incur the expense of bringing  the delinquents to justice. Mr. Sharp, with some difficulty, procured a  habeas corpus, in consequence of which Lewis was brought from Gravesend  just as the vessel was on the point of sailing. An action was then  commenced against Stapylton, who defended himself, on the plea, \"That Lewis  belonged to him as his slave.\" In the course of the trial, Mr. Dunning, who  was counsel for Lewis, paid Mr. Sharp a handsome compliment, for he held in  his hand Mr. Sharp's book on the injustice and dangerous tendency of  tolerating slavery in England, while he was pleading; and in his address to  the jury he spoke and acted thus: \"I shall submit to you,\" says Mr.  Dunning, \"what my ideas are upon such evidence, reserving to myself an  opportunity of discussing it more particularly, and reserving to myself a  right to insist upon a position, which I will maintain (and here he held up  the book to the notice of those present) in any place and in any court of  the kingdom, that our laws admit of no such property[A].\" The result of the  trial was, that the jury pronounced the plaintiff not to have been the  property of the defendant, several of them crying out \"No property, no  property.\"    [Footnote A: It is lamentable to think, that the same Mr. Dunning, in a  cause of this kind, which came on afterwards, took the opposite side of the  question.]    After this, one or two other trials came on, in which the oppressor was  defeated, and several cases occurred, in which poor slaves were liberated  from the holds of vessels, and other places of confinement, by the  exertions of Mr. Sharp. One of these cases was singular. The vessel on  board which a poor African had been dragged and confined had reached the  Downs, and had actually got under weigh for the West Indies. In two or  three hours she would have been out of sight; but just at this critical  moment the writ of habeas corpus was carried on board. The officer, who  served it on the captain, saw the miserable African chained to the  mainmast, bathed in tears, and casting a last mournful look on the land of  freedom, which was fast receding from his sight. The captain, on receiving  the writ, became outrageous; but, knowing the serious consequences of  resisting the law of the land, he gave up his prisoner, whom the officer  carried safe, but now crying for joy, to the shore.    But though the injured Africans, whose causes had been tried, escaped  slavery, and though many, who had been forcibly carried into dungeons,  ready to be transported into the Colonies, had been delivered out of them.  Mr. Sharp was not easy in his mind. Not one of the cases had yet been  pleaded on the broad ground, \"Whether an African slave coming into England  became free?\" This great question had been hitherto studiously avoided. It  was still, therefore, left in doubt. Mr. Sharp was almost daily acting as  if it had been determined, and as if he had been following the known law of  the land. He wished therefore that the next cause might be argued upon this  principle. Lord Mansfield too, who had been biassed by the opinion of York  and Talbot, began to waver in consequence of the different pleadings he had  heard on this subject. He saw also no end of trials like these, till the  law should be ascertained, and he was anxious for a decision on the same  basis as Mr. Sharp. In this situation the following case offered, which was  agreed upon for the determination of this important question.    James Somerset, an African slave, had been brought to England by his  master, Charles Stewart, in November 1769. Somerset, in process of time,  left him. Stewart took an opportunity of seizing him, and had him conveyed  on board the Ann and Mary, captain Knowles, to be carried out of the  kingdom and sold as a slave in Jamaica. The question was-\"Whether a slave,  by coming into England, became free?\"    In order that time might be given for ascertaining the law fully on this  head, the case was argued at three different sittings. First, in January,  1772; secondly, in February, 1772; and thirdly, in May, 1772. And that no  decision otherwise than what the law warranted might be given, the opinion  of the Judges was taken upon the pleadings. The great and glorious result  of the trial was, That as soon as ever any slave set his foot upon English  territory, he became free.    Thus ended the great case of Somerset, which, having been determined after  so deliberate an investigation of the law, can never be reversed while the  British Constitution remains. The eloquence displayed in it by those who  were engaged on the side of liberty, was perhaps never exceeded on any  occasion; and the names of the counsellors Davy, Glynn, Hargrave,  Mansfield, and Alleyne, ought always to be remembered with gratitude by the  friends of this great cause. For when we consider in how many crowded  courts they pleaded, and the number of individuals in these, whose minds  they enlightened, and whose hearts they interested in the subject, they are  certainly to be put down as no small instruments in the promotion of it:  but chiefly to him, under Divine Providence, are we to give the praise, who  became the first great actor in it, who devoted his time, his talents, and  his substance to this Christian undertaking, and by whose laborious  researches the very pleaders themselves were instructed and benefited. By  means of his almost incessant vigilance and attention, and unwearied  efforts, the poor African ceased to be hunted in our streets as a beast of  prey. Miserable as the roof might be, under which he slept, he slept in  security. He walked by the side of the stately ship, and he feared no  dungeon in her hold. Nor ought we, as Englishmen, to be less grateful to  this distinguished individual than the African ought to be upon this  occasion. To him we owe it, that we no longer see our public papers  polluted by hateful advertisements of the sale of the human species, or  that we are no longer distressed by the perusal of impious rewards for  bringing back the poor and the helpless into slavery, or that we are  prohibited the disgusting spectacle of seeing man bought by his  fellow-man.--To him, in short, we owe this restoration of the beauty of our  constitution--this prevention of the continuance of our national disgrace.    I shall say but little more of Mr. Sharp at present, than that he felt it  his duty, immediately after the trial, to write to Lord North, then  principal minister of state, warning him, in the most earnest manner, to  abolish immediately both the trade and the slavery of the human species in  all the British dominions, as utterly irreconcileable with the principles  of the British constitution, and the established religion of the land.    Among other coadjutors, whom the cruel and wicked practices which have now  been so amply detailed brought forward, was a worthy clergyman, whose name  I have not yet been able to learn. He endeavoured to interest the public  feeling in behalf of the injured Africans, by writing an epilogue to the  Padlock, in which Mungo appeared as a black servant. This epilogue is so  appropriate to the case, that I cannot but give it to the reader. Mungo  enters, and thus addresses the audience:--      \"Thank you, my Massas! have you laugh your fill?   "]]]
