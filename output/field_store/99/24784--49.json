Dave Naab moored his boat on that side of  the river, and returned with George.    \"We'll look over my farm,\" said August, as they retraced their steps. He  led Hare through fields of alfalfa, in all stages of growth, explaining  that it yielded six crops a year. Into one ten-acre lot pigs and cows  had been turned to feed at will. Everywhere the ground was soggy; little  streams of water trickled down ditches. Next to the fields was an  orchard, where cherries were ripe, apricots already large, plum-trees  shedding their blossoms, and apple-trees just opening into bloom. Naab  explained that the products of his oasis were abnormal; the ground was  exceedingly rich and could be kept always wet; the reflection of the sun  from the walls robbed even winter of any rigor, and the spring, summer,  and autumn were tropical. He pointed to grape-vines as large as a man's  thigh and told of bunches of grapes four feet long; he showed sprouting  plants on which watermelons and pumpkins would grow so large that one  man could not lift them; he told of one pumpkin that held a record of  taking two men to roll it.    \"I can raise any kind of fruit in such abundance that it can't be used.  My garden is prodigal. But we get little benefit, except for our own  use, for we cannot transport things across the desert.\"    The water which was the prime factor in all this richness came from a  small stream which Naab, by making a dam and tunnelling a corner of  cliff, had diverted from its natural course into his oasis.    Between the fence and the red wall there was a wide bare plain which  stretched to the house. At its farthest end was a green enclosure, which  Hare recognized as the cemetery mentioned by Snap. Hare counted thirty  graves, a few with crude monuments of stone, the others marked by wooden  head-pieces.    \"I've the reputation of doctoring the women, and letting the men die,\"  said Naab, with a smile. \"I hardly think it's fair. But the fact is no  women are buried here. Some graves are of men I fished out of the river;  others of those who drifted here, and who were killed or died keeping  their secrets. I've numbered those unknown graves and have kept a  description of the men, so, if the chance ever comes, I may tell some  one where a father or brother lies buried. Five sons of mine, not one of  whom died a natural death, found graves here--God rest them! Here's the  grave of Mescal's father, a Spaniard. He was an adventurer. I helped him  over in Nevada when he was ill; he came here with me, got well, and  lived nine years, and he died without speaking one word of himself or  telling his name.\"    \"What strange ends men come to!\" mused Hare. Well, a grave was a grave,  wherever it lay. He wondered if he would come to rest in that quiet  nook, with its steady light, its simple dignity of bare plain graves  fitting the brevity of life, the littleness of man.    \"We break wild mustangs along this stretch,\" said Naab, drawing Hare  away. \"It's a fine run. Wait till you see Mescal on Black Bolly tearing  up the dust! She's a Navajo for riding.\"    Three huge corrals filled a wide curved space in the wall. In one corral  were the teams that had hauled the wagons from White Sage; in another  upward of thirty burros, drooping, lazy little fellows half asleep; in  the third a dozen or more mustangs and some horses which delighted Hare.  Snap Naab's cream pinto, a bay, and a giant horse of mottled white  attracted him most.    \"Our best stock is out on the range,\" said Naab. \"The white is Charger,  my saddle-horse. When he was a yearling he got away and ran wild for  three years. But we caught him. He's a weight-carrier and he can run  some. You're fond of a horse--I can see that.\"    \"Yes,\" returned Hare, \"but I--I'll never ride again.\" He said it  brightly, smiling the while; still the look in his eyes belied the  cheerful resignation.    \"I've not the gift of revelation, yet I seem to see you on a big gray  horse with a shining mane.\" Naab appeared to be gazing far away.    The cottonwood grove, at the western curve of the oasis, shaded the five  log huts where August's grown sons lived with their wives, and his own  cabin, which was of considerable dimensions. It had a covered porch on  one side, an open one on the other, a shingle roof, and was a roomy and  comfortable habitation.    Naab was pointing out the school-house when he was interrupted by  childish laughter, shrieks of glee, and the rush of little feet.    \"It's recess-time,\" he said.    A frantic crowd of tousled-headed little ones were running from the log  school-house to form a circle under the trees. There were fourteen of  them, from four years of age up to ten or twelve. Such sturdy, glad-eyed  children Hare had never seen. In a few moments, as though their happy  screams were signals, the shady circle was filled with hounds, and a  string of puppies stepping on their long ears, and ruffling turkey-  gobblers, that gobbled and gobbled, and guinea-hens with their shrill  cries, and cackling chickens, and a lame wild goose that hobbled along  alone. Then there were shiny peafowls screeching clarion calls from the  trees overhead, and flocks of singing blackbirds, and pigeons hovering  over and alighting upon the house. Last to approach were a woolly sheep  that added his baa-baa to the din, and a bald-faced burro that walked in  his sleep. These two became the centre of clamor. After many tumbles  four chubby youngsters mounted the burro; and the others, with loud  acclaim, shouting, \"Noddle, Noddle, getup! getup!\" endeavored to make  him go. But Noddle nodded and refused to awaken or budge. Then an  ambitious urchin of six fastened his hands in the fur of the sheep and  essayed to climb to his back. Willing hands assisted him. \"Ride him,  Billy, ride him. Getup, Navvy, getup!\"    Navvy evidently had never been ridden, for he began a fair imitation of  a bucking bronco. Billy held on, but the smile vanished and the corners  of his mouth drew down.    \"Hang on, Billy, hang on,\" cried August Naab, in delight. Billy hung on  a moment longer, and then Navvy, bewildered by the pestering crowd about  him, launched out and, butting into Noddle, spilled the four youngsters  and Billy also into a wriggling heap.    This recess-time completed Hare's introduction to the Naabs. There were  Mother Mary, and Judith and Esther, whom he knew, and Mother Ruth and  her two daughters very like their sisters. Mother Ruth, August's second  wife, was younger than Mother Mary, more comely of face, and more sad  and serious of expression. The wives of the five sons, except Snap  Naab's frail bride, were stalwart women, fit to make homes and rear  children.    \"Now, Jack, things are moving all right,\" said August. \"For the present  you must eat and rest. Walk some, but don't tire yourself. We'll  practice shooting a little every day; that's one thing I'll spare time  for. I've a trick with a gun to teach you. And if you feel able, take a  burro and ride. Anyway, make yourself at home.\"    Hare found eating and resting to be matters of profound enjoyment.  Before he had fallen in with these good people it had been a year since  he had sat down to a full meal; longer still since he had eaten  wholesome food. And now he had come to a \"land overflowing with milk and  honey,\" as Mother Ruth smilingly said. He could not choose between roast  beef and chicken, and so he waived the question by taking both; and what  with the biscuits and butter, apple-sauce and blackberry jam, cherry pie  and milk like cream, there was danger of making himself ill. He told his  friends that he simply could not help it, which shameless confession  brought a hearty laugh from August and beaming smiles from his women-  folk.    For several days Hare was remarkably well, for an invalid. He won golden  praise from August at the rifle practice, and he began to take lessons  in the quick drawing and rapid firing of a Colt revolver. Naab was  wonderfully proficient in the use of both firearms; and his skill in  drawing the smaller weapon, in which his movement was quicker than the  eye, astonished Hare. \"My lad,\" said August, \"it doesn't follow because  I'm a Christian that I don't know how to handle a gun. Besides, I like  to shoot.\"    In these few days Hare learned what conquering the desert made of a man.  August Naab was close to threescore years; his chest was wide as a door,  his arm like the branch of an oak. He was a blacksmith, a mechanic, a  carpenter, a cooper, a potter. At his forge and in his shop, everywhere,  were crude tools, wagons, farming implements, sets of buckskin harness,  odds and ends of nameless things, eloquent and pregnant proof of the  fact that necessity is the mother of invention. He was a mason; the  levee that buffeted back the rage of the Colorado in flood, the wall  that turned the creek, the irrigation tunnel, the zigzag trail cut on  the face of the cliff--all these attested his eye for line, his judgment  of distance, his strength in toil. He was a farmer, a cattle man, a  grafter of fruit-trees, a breeder of horses, a herder of sheep, a  preacher, a physician. Best and strangest of all in this wonderful man  was the instinct and the heart to heal. \"I don't combat the doctrine of  the Mormon church,\" he said, \"but I administer a little medicine with my  healing. I learned that from the Navajos.\" The children ran to him with  bruised heads, and cut fingers, and stubbed toes; and his blacksmith's  hands were as gentle as a woman's. A mustang with a lame leg claimed his  serious attention; a sick sheep gave him an anxious look; a steer with a  gored skin sent him running for a bucket of salve. He could not pass by  a crippled quail. The farm was overrun by Navajo sheep which he had  found strayed and lost on the desert. Anything hurt or helpless had in  August Naab a friend. Hare found himself looking up to a great and  luminous figure,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#9)"],[1," manner universal  throughout nature. Science recognizes in the spiral an archetypal  form, whether found in a whirlpool or in a nebula. A fret is a series  of highly conventionalized spirals: translate it from angular to  curved and we have the wave-band; isolate it and we have the volute.  Egg and dart are phallic emblems, female and male; or, if you prefer,  as ellipse and straight line, they are symbols of finite existence  contrasted with infinity. [Figure 1.]    [Illustration: Figure 1.]    Suppose that we determine to divest ourselves of these and other  precious inheritances, not because they have lost their beauty and  meaning, but rather on account of their manifold associations with a  past which the war makes suddenly more remote than slow centuries have  done; suppose that we determine to supplant these symbols with others  no less charged with beauty and meaning, but more directly drawn from  the inexhaustible well of mathematical truth--how shall we set to  work?    We need not _set_ to work, because we have done that already, we are  always doing it, unknowingly, and without knowing the reason why. All  ornamentalists are subjective mathematicians--an amazing statement,  perhaps, but one susceptible of confirmation in countless amusing  ways, of which two will be shown.    [Illustration: Figure 2.]    Consider first your calendar--your calendar whose commonplace face,  having yielded you information as to pay day, due day, and holiday,  you obliterate at the end of each month without a qualm, oblivious to  the fact that were your interests less sordid and personal it would  speak to you of that order which pervades the universe; would make you  realize something of the music of the spheres. For on that familiar  checkerboard of the days are numerical arrangements which are  mysterious, \"magical\"; each separate number is as a spider at the  center of an amazing mathematical web. That is to say, every number  is discovered to be half of the sum of the pairs of numbers which  surround it, vertically, horizontally, and diagonally: all of the  pairs add to the same sum, and the central number divides this sum by  two. A graphic indication of this fact on the calendar face by means  of a system of intersecting lines yields that form of classic grille  dear to the heart of every tyro draughtsman. [Figure 2.] Here is  an evident relation between mathematical fact and ornamental mode,  whether the result of accident, or by reason of some subconscious  connection between the creative and the reasoning part of the mind.    To show, by means of an example other than this acrostic of the days,  how the pattern-making instinct follows unconsciously in the groove  traced out for it by mathematics, the attention of the reader is  directed to the design of the old Colonial bed-spread shown in Figure  3. Adjacent to this, in the upper right hand corner, is a magic  square of four. That is, all of the columns of figures of which it is  composed: vertical, horizontal and diagonal add to the same sum: 34.  An analysis of this square reveals the fact that it is made up of  the figures of two different orders of counting: the ordinary order,  beginning at the left hand upper corner and reading across and down in  the usual way, and the reverse-ordinary, beginning at the lower right  hand corner and reading across and up. The figures in the four central  cells and in the four outside corner cells are discovered to belong  in the first category, and the remaining figures in the second. Now  if the ordinary order cells be represented by white, and the reverse  ordinary by black, just such a pattern has been created as forms the  decorative motif of the quilt.    It may be claimed that these two examples of a relation between  ornament and mathematics are accidental and therefore prove nothing,  but they at least furnish a clue which the artist would be foolish not  to follow up. Let him attack his problem this time directly, and  see if number may not be made to yield the thing he seeks: namely,  space-rhythms which are beautiful and new.    We know that there is a beauty inherent in _order_, that necessity of  one sort or another is the parent of beauty. Beauty in architecture  is largely the result of structural necessity; beauty in ornament  may spring from a necessity which is numerical. It is clear that the  arrangement of numbers in a magic square is necessitous--they must be  placed in a certain way in order that the summation of every column  shall be the same. The problem then becomes to make that necessity  reveal itself to the eye. Now most magic squares contain a _magic  path_, discovered by following the numbers from cell to cell in  their natural order. Because this is a necessitous line it should not  surprise us that it is frequently beautiful as well.    [Illustration: Figure 3.]    The left hand drawing in Figure 4 represents the smallest aggregation  of numbers that is capable of magic square arrangement. Each vertical,  horizontal, and corner diagonal column adds up to 15, and the sum of  any two opposite numbers is 10, which is twice the center number. The  magic path is the endless line developed by following, free hand, the  numbers in their natural order, from 1 to 9 and back to 1 again. The  drawing at the right of Figure 4 is this same line translated into  ornament by making an interlace of it, and filling in the larger  interstices with simple floral forms. This has been executed in white  plaster and made to perform the function of a ventilating grille.    Now the number of magic squares is practically limitless, and while  all of them do not yield magic lines of the beauty of this one, some  contain even richer decorative possibilities. But there are also other  ways of deriving ornament from magic squares, already hinted at in the  discussion of the Colonial quilt.    [Illustration: Figure 4.]    [Illustration: Figure 5.]    Magic squares of an even number of cells are found sometimes to  consist of numbers arranged not only in combinations of the ordinary  and the reverse ordinary orders of counting, but involving two others  as well: the reverse of the ordinary (beginning at the upper right  hand, across, and down) and the reversed inverse, (beginning at the  lower left hand, across, and up). If, in such a magic square, a simple  graphic symbol be substituted for the numbers belonging to each order,  pattern spontaneously springs to life. Figures 5 and 6 exemplify the  method, and Figures 7 and 8 the translation of some of these squares  into richer patterns by elaborating the symbols while respecting their  arrangement. By only a slight stretch of the imagination the beautiful  pierced stone screen from Ravenna shown in Figure 9 might be conceived  of as having been developed according to this method, although of  course it was not so in fact. Some of the arrangements shown in Figure  6 are closely paralleled in the acoustic figures made by means of  musical tones with sand, on a sheet of metal or glass.    [Illustration: Figure 6.]    [Illustration: Figure 7.]    The celebrated Franklin square of 16 cells can be made to yield a  beautiful pattern by designating some of the lines which give the  summation of 2056 by different symbols, as shown in Figure 10. A free  translation of this design into pattern brickwork is indicated in  Figure 11.    If these processes seem unduly involved and elaborate for the  achievement of a simple result--like burning the house down in  order to get roast pig--there are other more simple ways of deriving  ornament from mathematics, for the truths of number find direct and  perfect expression in the figures of geometry. The squaring of  a number--the raising of it to its second power--finds graphic  expression in the plane figure of the square; and the cubing of a  number--the raising of it to its third power--in the solid figure  of the cube. Now squares and cubes have been recognized from time  immemorial as useful ornamental motifs. Other elementary geometrical  figures, making concrete to the eye the truths of abstract number, may  be dealt with by the designer in such a manner as to produce ornament  the most varied and profuse. Moorish ceilings, Gothic window tracery,  Grolier bindings, all indicate the richness of the field.    [Illustration: Figure 8.]    [Illustration: PLATE XII. IMAGINARY COMPOSITION. THE BALCONY]    [Illustration: Figure 9.]    Suppose, for example, that we attempt to deal decoratively which such  simple figures as the three lowest Platonic solids--the tetrahedron,  the hexahedron, and the octahedron. [Figure 12.] Their projection on a  plane yields a rhythmical division of space, because of their inherent  symmetry. These projections would correspond to the network of lines  seen in looking through a glass paperweight of the given shape, the  lines being formed by the joining of the several faces. Figure 13  represents ornamental bands developed in this manner. The dodecahedron  and icosahedron, having more faces, yield more intricate patterns, and  there is no limit to the variety of interesting designs obtainable by  these direct and simple means.    [Illustration: Figure 10.]    If the author has been successful thus far in his exposition, it  should be sufficiently plain that from the inexhaustible well of  mathematics fresh beauty may be drawn. But what of its significance?  Ornament must _mean something_; it must have some relation to the  dominant ideation of the day; it must express the psychological mood.    What is the psychological mood? Ours is an age of transition; we live  in a changing world. On the one hand we witness the breaking up of  many an old thought crystal, on the other we feel the pressure of  those forces which shall create the new. What is nature's first  visible creative act? The formation of a geometrical crystal. The  artist should take this hint, and organize geometry into a new  ornamental"]]]
