They only inflamed her passion the more by feeding  her hopes. She said: \"There, seest thou, thou dost love me  now! It sufficeth for me that thou takest thought for me  and for the safety of my children. I expect now that my  desire will be fulfilled.\" She did not know that Joseph spoke  as he did for the sake of God, and not for her sake.[110]    His mistress, or, as she was called, Zuleika, pursued him  day after day with her amorous talk and her flattery, saying:  \"How fair is thy appearance, how comely thy form! Never  have I seen so well-favored a slave as thou art.\" Joseph  would reply: \"God, who formed me in my mother's womb,  hath created all men.\"    Zuleika: \"How beautiful are thine eyes, with which thou  hast charmed all Egyptians, both men and women!\"    Joseph: \"Beautiful as they may be while I am alive, so  ghastly they will be to look upon in the grave.\"    Zuleika: \"How lovely and pleasant are thy words! I  pray thee, take thy harp, play and also sing, that I may hear  thy words.\"    Joseph: \"Lovely and pleasant are my words when I proclaim  the praise of my God.\"    Zuleika: \"How beautiful is thy hair! Take my golden  comb, and comb it.\"    Joseph: \"How long wilt thou continue to speak thus to  me? Leave off! It were better for thee to care for thy  household.\"    Zuleika: \"There is nothing in my house that I care for,  save thee alone.\"    But Joseph's virtue was unshaken. While she spoke thus,  he did not so much as raise his eyes to look at his  mistress.[111]  He remained equally steadfast when she lavished gifts upon  him, for she provided him with garments of one kind for the  morning, another for noon, and a third kind for the evening.  Nor could threats move him. She would say, \"I will bring  false accusations against thee before thy master,\" and Joseph  would reply, \"The Lord executeth judgment for the oppressed.\"  Or, \"I will deprive thee of food;\" whereupon  Joseph, \"The Lord giveth food to the hungry.\" Or, \"I  will have thee thrown into prison;\" whereupon Joseph,  \"The Lord looseth the prisoners.\" Or, \"I will put heavy  labor upon thee that will bend thee double;\" whereupon  Joseph, \"The Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down.\"  Or, \"I will blind thine eyes;\" whereupon Joseph, \"The  Lord openeth the eyes of the blind.\"[112]    When she began to exercise her blandishments upon him,  he rejected them with the words, \"I fear my master.\" But  Zuleika would say, \"I will kill him.\" Joseph replied with  indignation, \"Not enough that thou wouldst make an adulterer  of me, thou wouldst have me be a murderer, besides?\"  And he spoke furthermore, saying, \"I fear the Lord my  God!\"    Zuleika: \"Nonsense! He is not here to see thee!    Joseph: \"Great is the Lord and highly to be praised, and  His greatness is unsearchable.\"    Thereupon she took Joseph into her chamber, where an  idol hung above the bed. This she covered, that it might not  be a witness of what she was about to do. Joseph said:  \"Though thou coverest up the eyes of the idol, remember,  the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.  Yes,\" continued Joseph, \"I have many reasons not to do this  thing for the sake of God. Adam was banished from Paradise  on account of violating a light command; how much  more should I have to fear the punishment of God, were I to  commit so grave a sin as adultery! The Lord is in the habit  of choosing a favorite member of our family as a sacrifice  unto Himself. Perhaps He desireth to make choice of me,  but if I do thy will, I make myself unfit to be a sacrifice unto  God. Also the Lord is in the habit of appearing suddenly,  in visions of the night, unto those that love Him. Thus did  He appear unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I fear that  He may appear unto me at the very moment while I am defiling  myself with thee. And as I fear God, so I fear my  father, who withdrew the birthright from his first-born son  Reuben, on account of an immoral act, and gave it to me.  Were I to fulfil thy desire, I would share the fate of my  brother Reuben.\"[113]    With such words, Joseph endeavored to cure the wife of  his master of the wanton passion she had conceived for him,  while he took heed to keep far from a heinous sin, not from  fear of the punishment that would follow, nor out of  consideration for the opinion of men, but because he desired to  sanctify the Name of God, blessed be He, before the whole  world.[114] It was this feeling of his that Zuleika could not  comprehend, and when, finally, carried away by passion, she  told him in unmistakable language what she desired,[115] and  he recoiled from her, she said to Joseph: \"Why dost thou  refuse to fulfil my wish? Am I not a married woman?  None will find out what thou hast done.\" Joseph replied:  \"If the unmarried women of the heathen are prohibited  unto us, how much more their married women?[116] As the  Lord liveth, I will not commit the crime thou biddest me do.\"  In this Joseph followed the example of many pious men, who  utter an oath at the moment when they are in danger of succumbing  to temptation, and seek thus to gather moral courage  to control their evil instincts.\"    When Zuleika could not prevail upon him, to persuade  him, her desire threw her into a grievous sickness, and all  the women of Egypt came to visit her, and they said unto  her, \"Why art thou so languid and wasted, thou that lackest  nothing? Is not thy husband a prince great and esteemed  in the sight of the king? Is it possible that thou canst want  aught of what thy heart desireth?\" Zuleika answered them,  saying, \"This day shall it be made known unto you whence  cometh the state wherein you see me.\"    She commanded her maid-servants to prepare food for all  the women, and she spread a banquet before them in her  house. She placed knives upon the table to peel the oranges,  and then ordered Joseph to appear, arrayed in costly garments,  and wait upon her guests. When Joseph came in,  the women could not take their eyes off him, and they all cut  their hands with the knives, and the oranges in their hands  were covered with blood, but they, not knowing what they  were doing, continued to look upon the beauty of Joseph  without turning their eyes away from him.    Then Zuleika said unto them: \"What have ye done?  Behold, I set oranges before you to eat, and you have cut  your hands.\" All the women looked at their hands, and, lo,  they were full of blood, and it flowed down and stained their  garments. They said to Zuleika, \"This slave in thy house  did enchant us, and we could not turn our eyes away from  him on account of his beauty.\" She then said: \"This happened  to you that looked upon him but a moment, and you  could not refrain yourselves! How, then, can I control  myself in whose house he abideth continually, who see him  go in and out day after day? How, then, should I not waste  away, or keep from languishing on account of him!\" And  the women spake, saying: \"It is true, who can look upon  this beauty in the house, and refrain her feelings? But he  is thy slave! Why dost thou not disclose to him that which  is in thy heart, rather than suffer thy life to perish through  this thing?\" Zuleika answered them: \"Daily do I endeavor  to persuade him, but he will not consent to my  wishes. I promised him everything that is fair, yet have I  met with no return from him, and therefore I am sick, as  you may see.\"    Her sickness increased upon her. Her husband and her  household suspected not the cause of her decline, but all the  women that were her friends knew that it was on account  of the love she bore Joseph, and they advised her all the time  to try to entice the youth. On a certain day, while Joseph  was doing his master's work in the house, Zuleika came and  fell suddenly upon him, but Joseph was stronger than she,  and he pressed her down to the ground. Zuleika wept, and  in a voice of supplication, and in bitterness of soul, she said  to Joseph: \"Hast thou ever known, seen, or heard of a  woman my peer in beauty, let alone a woman with beauty  exceeding mine? Yet I try daily to persuade thee, I fall  into decline through love of thee, I confer all this honor  upon thee, and thou wilt not hearken unto my voice! Is it  by reason of fear of thy master, that he punish thee? As  the king liveth, no harm shall come upon thee from thy  master on account of this thing. Now, therefore, I pray  thee, listen to me, and consent unto my desire for the sake of  the honor that I have conferred upon thee, and take this  death away from me. For why should I die on account of  thee?\" Joseph remained as steadfast under these importunities  as before. Zuleika, however, was not discouraged;  she continued her solicitations unremittingly, day after  day,[118] month after month, for a whole year, but always  without the least success, for Joseph in his chastity did not  permit himself even to look upon her, wherefore she resorted  to constraint. She had an iron shackle placed upon his chin,  and he was compelled to keep his head up and look her in  the face.\"[119]      JOSEPH RESISTS TEMPTATION    Seeing that she could not attain her object by entreaties  or tears, Zuleika finally used force, when she judged that  the favorable chance had come. She did not have long to  wait. When the Nile overflowed its banks, and, according  to the annual custom of the Egyptians, all repaired to the  river, men and women, people and princes, accompanied by  music, Zuleika remained at home under pretense of being  sick.

They were  the voices of Mr. Fox and Mr. Badger.    \"'These are terrible times,' said Mr. Fox. 'I'm so hungry that I'm  wasting away to a shadow. I wonder who has dug this hole.'    \"'Mr. Mole,' replied Mr. Badger. 'I saw him at work here this  morning.    Have you noticed how very plump he looks?'    \"'Yes,' replied Mr. Fox. 'He made my mouth water the very last time I  saw him. Seems to me I can smell him now. If he had made this hole  just a little bit bigger I would go down and pull him out, but I am  too tired to do any digging now.'    \"'I tell you what,' replied Mr. Badger. 'We'll hunt together a little  longer, and then if we can't find anything to eat, we'll come back,  and I'll help you dig, I hate to hurt Mr. Mole, because he always  minds his own business, but these are hard times, and each one must  look out for himself.'    \"With that they went away, leaving Mr. Mole shaking with fright at the  bottom of his hole. 'It's of no use,' thought Mr. Mole. 'If I go  outside, they will soon find me, and if I stay here, they will dig me  out. Oh, dear, oh, dear! What ever can I do?'    \"He lay there feeling very helpless and miserable, when all of a  sudden a thought came to him. If he had made his hole small, just big  enough for him to crawl into, Mr. Badger and Mr. Fox would have had to  do a great deal of digging to make it big enough for either of them to  get in! He would make a little tunnel off one side and hide in that.  So he went to work and made a little tunnel off one side just big  enough for him to squeeze into. He worked very hard and very fast, and  by the time Mr. Badger and Mr. Fox returned, Mr. Mole was at the end  of a long tunnel, so far from the hole he had first dug that he knew  it would take them a long time to dig him out, even if they noticed  his tunnel.    \"But they didn't. They dug down to the bottom of his hole and then,  because they didn't find him there, they straightway fell to  quarreling, each blaming the other for suggesting such a lot of hard  work for nothing. Finally they went away, still calling each other  names, and from that day to this, Foxes and Badgers have never been  friends.    \"Mr. Mole was very thankful for his narrow escape, and it set him to  thinking. If he had a lot of these underground tunnels, no one would  be able to catch him. It was a splendid idea! He went to work on it at  once. And then he made a discovery--such a splendid discovery! There  was plenty of food to eat right down under ground--worms and  grubs--all he needed. After that, Mr. Mole spent all his time in his  tunnels and seldom put his nose outside. He was safe, and he was  comfortable, and he could always find something to eat by digging for  it.    \"Little by little his old neighbors forgot all about him. Because he  had little use for them, his eyes grew smaller and smaller, and when  he did come up into the light, they hurt him so that he was glad to go  back into the dark again. He was perfectly happy and satisfied there,  and what is there in life better than to be happy and satisfied?\"    \"Nothing,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, at whom Grandfather Frog happened  to be looking when he asked the question.    \"Right!\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"And now you know why Miner the  Mole lives under ground--because he is perfectly happy and satisfied  there.\"    Just then up came Peter Rabbit, all out of breath.    \"Has Grandfather Frog been telling a story?\" he panted.    \"Yes,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, winking at Grandfather Frog, \"and now  we are going back home perfectly happy and satisfied.\"    And to this day Peter Rabbit wonders what the story was that he  missed.          X    WHY MR. SNAKE CANNOT WINK      Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were playing tag on the Green Meadows.  Of course Peter can run so much faster than Johnny Chuck that he would  never have been \"it\" if he had tried his best to keep out of the way.  But he didn't. No, Sir, Peter Rabbit didn't do anything of the kind.  He pretended that one of his long hind-legs was lame so that he had to  run on three legs, while Johnny Chuck could use all four. It was great  fun. They raced and dodged and twisted and turned. Sometimes Peter was  so excited that he would forget and use all four legs. Then Johnny  Chuck would shout \"No fair!\" Peter would say that he didn't mean to,  and to make up for it would be \"it\" and try to catch Johnny.    Now it happened that curled up on a little grassy tussock, taking an  early morning sun-bath, lay little Mr. Greensnake. Of course Peter  Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were not afraid of him. If it had been Mr.  Rattlesnake or Mr. Gophersnake, it would have been different. But from  little Mr. Greensnake there was nothing to fear, and sometimes, just  for fun, Peter would jump right over him. When he did that, Peter  always winked good-naturedly. But Mr. Greensnake never winked back.  Instead he would raise his head, run his tongue out at Peter, and hiss  in what he tried to make a very fierce and angry manner. Then Peter  would laugh and wink at him again. But never once did Mr. Greensnake  wink back.    [Illustration: He would make no reply, save to run out his tongue at  them.]    Peter was thinking of this as he and Johnny Chuck stretched out in a  sunny spot to get their breath and rest. He had never thought of it  before, but now that he had noticed it, he couldn't remember that he  ever had seen little Mr. Greensnake wink, nor any of Mr. Greensnake's  relatives. He mentioned the matter to Johnny Chuck.    \"That's so,\" replied Johnny thoughtfully. \"I never have seen any of  them wink, either. Do you suppose they can wink?\"    \"Let's go ask Mr. Greensnake,\" said Peter.    Up they hopped and raced over to the grassy tussock where Mr.  Greensnake lay, but to all their questions he would make no reply save  to run out his tongue at them. Finally they gave up asking him.    \"I tell you what, let's go over to the Smiling Pool and ask  Grandfather Frog. He'll be sure to know, and perhaps, if he is feeling  good, he'll tell us a story,\" said Peter.    So off they scampered to the Smiling Pool. There they found  Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily-pad just as usual, and  Peter knew by the look in his great, goggly eyes that Grandfather Frog  had a good breakfast of foolish green flies tucked away inside his  white and yellow waistcoat. His eyes twinkled as Peter and Johnny very  politely wished him good morning.    \"Good morning,\" said he gruffly.    But Peter had seen that twinkle in his eyes and knew that Grandfather  Frog was feeling good-natured in spite of his gruff greeting.    \"If you please, Grandfather Frog, why doesn't Mr. Greensnake wink at  us when we wink at him?\" he asked.    \"Chug-a-rum! Because he can't,\" replied Grandfather Frog.    \"Can't!\" cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck together.    \"That's what I said--can't,\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"And no more  can Mr. Blacksnake, or Mr. Rattlesnake, or Mr. Gophersnake, or any  other member of the Snake family.\"    \"Why not?\" cried Peter and Johnny, all in the same breath.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog, folding his hands across his  white and yellow waistcoat, \"if you will sit still until I finish,  I'll tell you; but if you move or ask any foolish questions, I'll stop  right where I am, and you'll never hear the end of the story, for no  one else knows it.\"    Of course Peter and Johnny promised to sit perfectly still and not say  a word. After they had made themselves comfortable, Grandfather Frog  cleared his throat as if to begin, but for a long time he didn't say a  word. Once Peter opened his mouth to ask why, but remembered in time  and closed it again without making a sound.    At last Grandfather Frog cleared his throat once more, and with a  far-away look in his great, goggly eyes began:    \"Once upon a time, long, long ago, when the world was young, lived old  Mr. Snake, the grandfather a thousand times removed of little Mr.  Greensnake and all the other Snakes whom you know. Of course he wasn't  old then. He was young and spry and smart, was Mr. Snake. Now there is  such a thing as being too smart. That was the trouble with Mr. Snake.  Yes, Sir, that was the trouble with Mr. Snake. He was so smart that he  soon found out that he was the smartest of all the meadow and forest  people, and that was a bad thing. It certainly was a very bad thing.\"  Grandfather Frog shook his head gravely.    \"You see,\" he continued, \"as soon as he found that out, he began to  take advantage of his neighbors and cheat them, but he would do it so  smoothly that they never once suspected that they were being cheated.  Mr. Snake would go about all day cheating everybody he met. At night  he would go home and chuckle over his smartness. It wasn't long before  he began to look down on his neighbors for being so honest that they  didn't suspect other people of being dishonest, and for being so  easily cheated.    \"Now one bad habit almost always leads to another. From cheating, Mr.  Snake just naturally slipped to stealing. Yes, Sir, he became a thief.  Of course that made trouble right away, but still no one suspected  Mr. Snake. He was always very polite to every one and always offering  to do favors for his neighbors. In fact, Mr. Snake was very well liked  and much respected. When any one had been robbed, he was always the  first to offer sympathy and join in the hunt for the thief. He was so  spry and slim, and could slip through the tall grass so fast, that he  could go almost where he pleased without being seen, and this made him  very bold. If he did happen to be found near the scene of trouble, he  always had a story ready to account for his presence, and it sounded  so true, and he told it in such an honest manner, that no one thought  of doubting it.    \"So Mr. Snake found that lying helped him to cheat and steal, and all  the time he kept thinking how smart he was. But even "]]]
