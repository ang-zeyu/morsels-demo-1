Upon his final retirement from this post, and, in fact, from  all public employment, the administration of General Jackson sought  to secure his services in the mission to Constantinople, but the  proffered appointment was declined.    \"There are many interesting incidents in his public and diplomatic  career, which a more extended notice would enable us to detail.  Indeed, we hope that so instructive a life as that of Mr. Erving  may hereafter find a fit historian. That historian may not have  to chronicle victories won upon the battle field, but the civic  achievement he will have to record, if not so dazzling as the former,  will, at least, be as replete with evidences of public usefulness.    \"The latter years of his life were passed in Europe, chiefly in Paris.  The public agitations consequent upon the last French revolution,  need of quiet at his advanced age, and the presentiment of approaching  dissolution, induced him to return home. Indeed it was meet that he  should close his mortal career in that country which he had so long  and faithfully served, and whose welfare and happiness had been the  constant object of his every earthly aspiration.\"           *       *       *       *       *    DR. JOHN BURNS.    Among those who perished in the wreck of the _Orion_, was Dr. John  Burns, Professor of Surgery in the University of Glasgow, aged about  eighty years. Dr. Burns held a distinguished place in the medical  world, for at least half a century, as an author and a teacher. He was  a son of the Rev. Dr. John Burns, for more than sixty years minister  of the Barony parish of Glasgow, who died about fourteen years ago,  at the age of ninety. He was originally intended to be a manufacturer,  and in his time the necessary training for this business included  a practical application to the loom. A disease of the knee-joint  unfitted him for becoming a weaver, and he turned his attention to  the medical profession, winch the neighboring university afforded him  easy and ample means of studying. He early entered into business as  a general practitioner, but his ambition led him very soon to be an  instructor. In 1800, he published _Dissertations on Inflammation_,  which raised his name to a high position in the literature of his  profession. In 1807, he published a kindred volume on Hemorrhage.  In the mean time he had turned his attention to lecturing, and  he continued to give, for many years, lectures on midwifery. His  observations and experience on this subject he offered to the world  in _The Principles of Midwifery_, a work which has run through  twelve editions, and been translated into several of the continental  languages. It is very elaborate and valuable, and as each succeeding  edition presented the result of the author's increasing experience, it  became a standard in every medical library. Its chief defect is a want  of clearness in the arrangement, and sometimes in the language. In  1815, the crown instituted a Professorship of Surgery in the Glasgow  University, and the Duke of Montrose, its chancellor, appointed to  it Mr. Burns, a choice which the voice of the profession generally  approved. The value of the professorship might average 500l. yearly.    As a professor, Dr. Burns was highly popular. He had a cheerful and  attractive manner, and was fond of bringing in anecdotes more or less  applicable, but always enlivening. His language was plain and clear,  but not always correct or elegant. In personal appearance, he was  of the middle size, of an anxious and careworn, but gentlemanly  and intelligent, expression of countenance. In 1830, he published  _Principles of Surgery_, first volume, which was followed by another.  This work is confused, both in style and arrangement, and has been  very little read, but it did credit to his zeal and industry, for he  had now acquired fame and fortune, and had long had at his command  the most extensive practice in the west of Scotland. John Burns,  the younger, had written and published a work on the evidences and  principles of Christianity, which was extensively read, and went  through many editions. His name was not at first on the title-page,  but that it was the production of a medical man was obvious. He gave  a copy to his father, who shortly after said, \"Ah, John, I wish _you_  could have written such a book!\" Dr. Burns has many friends in the  United States, who were once his pupils. One of the most eminent of  them is Professor Pattison of the Medical Department of the New York  University, in this city.           *       *       *       *       *    HORACE SUMNER.    This gentleman, one of the victims of the lamentable wreck of the  Elizabeth, was the youngest son of the late Charles P. Sumner, of  Boston, for many years Sheriff of Suffolk county, and the brother of  George Sumner, Esq., of Boston, who is well known for his legal and  literary eminence throughout the country. He was about twenty-four  years of ago, and has been abroad for nearly a year, traveling in the  south of Europe for the benefit of his health. The past winter was  spent by him chiefly in Florence, where he was on terms of familiar  intimacy with the Marquis and Marchioness d'Ossoli, and was induced  to take passage in the same vessel with them for his return to his  native land. He was a young man of singular modesty of deportment,  of an original turn of mind, and greatly endeared to his friends  by the sweetness of his disposition and the purity of his  character.--_Tribune_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FINE ARTS.      POWERS'S STATUE OF CALHOUN.--An unfortunate fatality appears to wait  upon the works of Hiram Powers. It is but a few weeks since his \"Eve\"  was lost on the coast of Spain, and it is still uncertain here whether  that exquisite statue is preserved without such injury as materially  to affect its value. And his masterpiece in history--perhaps his  masterpiece in all departments--the statue of Calhoun, which has been  so anxiously looked-for ever since the death of the great senator, was  buried under the waves in which Madame d'Ossoli and Horace Sumner were  lost, on the morning of the 19th, near Fire Island. At the time this  sheet is sent to press we are uncertain as to the recovery of the  statue, but we hope for the sake of art and for the satisfaction of  all the parties interested, that it will still reach its destination.  It is insured in Charleston, and Mr. Kellogg, the friend and agent  of Mr. Powers, has been at the scene of the misfortune, with all  necessary means for its preservation, if that be possible.           *       *       *       *       *    HORACE VERNET, the great painter, has returned to Paris from St.  Petersburgh. Offensive reports were current respecting his journey: he  had been paid, it was alleged, in most princely style by the Emperor,  for his masterly efforts in translating to canvas the principal  incidents of the Hungarian and Polish wars. He came back, it was  declared, loaded and content, with a hundred thousand dollars and a  kiss--an actual kiss--from his Imperial Majesty. M. Vernet has deemed  it necessary to publish a letter, correcting what was erroneous in  these reports. He says:--\"In repairing to Russia I was actuated by  only one desire, and had but a single object, and that was, to thank  His Majesty, the Emperor, for the honors with which he had already  loaded me, and for the proofs of his munificence which I had  previously received. I intended to bring back, and in fact have  brought back from the journey, nothing but the satisfaction of having  performed an entirely disinterested duty of respectful gratitude.\" It  is true, however, that he lent his powers to illustrate the triumph of  despotism, and if he brought back no gold the matter is not all helped  by that fact.           *       *       *       *       *          AUTHORS AND BOOKS.      THE REV. JAMES H. PERKINS, of Cincinnati, whose suicide during a fit  of madness, several months ago, will be generally recollected for  the many expressions of profound regret which it occasioned, we are  pleased to learn, is to be the subject of a biography by the Rev. W.H.  Channing. Mr. Perkins was a man of the finest capacities, and of large  and genial scholarship. He wrote much, in several departments, and  almost always well. His historical works, relating chiefly to the  western States, have been little read in this part of the Union;  but his contributions to the North American Review and the Christian  Examiner, and his tales, sketches, essays, and poems, printed under  various signatures, have entitled him to a desirable reputation as  a man of letters. These are all to be collected and edited by Mr.  Channing.           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. ESLING, better known as Miss Catherine H.

Violet and Slingsby and Guy and Lionel were greatly struck with this  singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked  permission of the Blue-Bottle-Flies (which was most courteously granted),  the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front  of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some  pebbles in the hot water; and the Quangle-Wangle played some tunes over it  on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the  very best quality.    The four children then entered into conversation with the  Blue-Bottle-Flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though  with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each  held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned  a fizzy, extraneous utterance.    \"Why,\" said Violet, \"would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles;  and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed,  in yellow bottles?\"    To which questions a very aged Blue-Bottle-Fly answered, \"We found the  bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great-  great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. And, when the  winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely  feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the  case with bottles of any other color than blue.\"    \"Of course it could not,\" said Slingsby. \"But, if we may take the liberty  of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?\"    \"Mainly on oyster-patties,\" said the Blue-Bottle-Fly; \"and, when these are  scarce, on raspberry vinegar and Russian leather boiled down to a jelly.\"    \"How delicious!\" said Guy.    To which Lionel added, \"Huzz!\" And all the Blue-Bottle-Flies said, \"Buzz!\"    At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to  be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the Blue-Bottle-Flies began to  buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and  mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the  tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant  mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly  virtuous. The Moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky,  while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of  the Blue-Bottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all  Nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.    In many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that  evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past  midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the  Quangle-Wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective  positions, and the Pussy-Cat stationed at the helm--the children each took  a last and affectionate farewell of the Blue-Bottle-Flies, who walked down  in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.    [Illustration]    As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a courtesy quite down  to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into  the back hair of the most pleasing of the Blue-Bottle-Flies; while  Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them three small boxes, containing,  respectively, black pins, dried figs, and Epsom salts; and thus they left  that happy shore forever.    Overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped  into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. But all along the shore, for  many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs,  and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their  pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly  along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from  the Land of the Happy Blue-Bottle-Flies.    Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that,  as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an  unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of Crabs and  Crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and  endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they  moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and  white-wine negus.    \"Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?\" said the four  children.    \"Thank you kindly,\" said the Crabs consecutively. \"We are trying to make  some worsted mittens, but do not know how.\"    On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of  mitten-making, said to the Crabs, \"Do your claws unscrew, or are they  fixtures?\"    \"They are all made to unscrew,\" said the Crabs; and forthwith they  deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which Violet  uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens  with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having resumed and screwed on  their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly  on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.    After this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast  and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could  be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there  appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer  approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody  in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and  oyster-shells. \"It does not quite look like a human being,\" said Violet  doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the  Quangle-Wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly  in a loud voice, \"It is the co-operative Cauliflower!\"    [Illustration]    And so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for  an immense wig was in reality the top of the Cauliflower; and that he had  no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and  graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which  naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.    Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with  mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat  plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps  supported by two superincumbent confidential Cucumbers, and a large number  of Waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a  row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a  crystal cloud of sudorific sand.    [Illustration]    So remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply;  and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of  undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.    Shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some  high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious  little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate  upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was  instantly upset.    [Illustration]    But this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to  swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the  moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered  the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense  force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in  rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of  lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits;  whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became  unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were  turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.    Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place,  where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of  mulberry-jam. This is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed Apes who  abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food  in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve  it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of  the country. Only one of the yellow-nosed Apes was on the spot, and he was  fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the Quangle-Wangle and Pussy were  so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they  merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their  boat without delay.    What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the  tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an aquatic and  ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in  those excessive longitudes! In a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into  fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became  quite clear that Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel could no longer  preliminate their voyage by sea.    The four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their  wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at  that moment an elderly Rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four  mounting on his back,--the Quangle-Wangle sitting on his horn, and holding  on by his ears, and the Pussy-Cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they  set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes  to last through their whole journey.
