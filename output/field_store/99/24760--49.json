In his agitation, he stepped forward into the  lighter part of the room, and I could see that his face was pale to  ghastliness--except his nose and the adjacent red patches on his cheeks,  which stood out in grotesquely hideous contrast. Presently, however, he  recovered a little and said:    \"I really think--at least I hope--that you take an unnecessarily serious  view of his condition. He has been like this before, you know.\"    I felt pretty certain that he had not, but there was no use in  discussing the question. I therefore replied, as I continued my efforts  to rouse the patient:    \"That may or may not be. But in any case there comes a last time; and it  may have come now.\"    \"I hope not,\" he said; \"although I understand that these cases always  end fatally sooner or later.\"    \"What cases?\" I asked.    \"I was referring to sleeping sickness; but perhaps you have formed some  other opinion as to the nature of this dreadful complaint.\"    I hesitated for a moment, and he continued: \"As to your suggestion that  his symptoms might be due to drugs, I think we may consider that as  disposed of. He has been watched, practically without cessation since  you came last, and, moreover, I have myself turned out the room and  examined the bed and have not found a trace of any drug. Have you gone  into the question of sleeping sickness?\"    I looked at the man narrowly before answering, and distrusted him more  than ever. But this was no time for reticence. My concern was with the  patient and his present needs. After all, I was, as Thorndyke had said,  a doctor, not a detective, and the circumstances called for  straightforward speech and action on my part.    \"I have considered that question,\" I said, \"and have come to a perfectly  definite conclusion. His symptoms are not those of sleeping sickness.  They are in my opinion undoubtedly due to morphine poisoning.\"    \"But my dear sir!\" he exclaimed, \"the thing is impossible! Haven't I  just told you that he has been watched continuously?\"    \"I can only judge by the appearances that I find,\" I answered; and,  seeing that he was about to offer fresh objections, I continued: \"Don't  let us waste precious time in discussion, or Mr. Graves may be dead  before we have reached a conclusion. If you will hurry them up about the  coffee that I asked for some time ago, I will take the other necessary  measures, and perhaps we may manage to pull him round.\"    The rather brutal decision of my manner evidently daunted him. It must  have been plain to him that I was not prepared to accept any explanation  of the unconscious man's condition other than that of morphine  poisoning; whence the inference was pretty plain that the alternatives  were recovery or an inquest. Replying stiffly that I \"must do as I  thought best,\" he hurried from the room, leaving me to continue my  efforts without further interruption.    For some time these efforts seemed to make no impression. The man lay as  still and impassive as a corpse excepting for the slow, shallow and  rather irregular breathing with its ominous accompanying rattle. But  presently, by imperceptible degrees, signs of returning life began to  make their appearance. A sharp slap on the cheek with the wet towel  produced a sensible flicker of the eyelids; a similar slap on the chest  was followed by a slight gasp. A pencil, drawn over the sole of the  foot, occasioned a visible shrinking movement, and, on looking once  more at the eyes, I detected a slight change that told me that the  atropine was beginning to take effect.    This was very encouraging, and, so far, quite satisfactory, though it  would have been premature to rejoice. I kept the patient carefully  covered and maintained the process of gentle irritation, moving his  limbs and shoulders, brushing his hair and generally bombarding his  deadened senses with small but repeated stimuli. And under this  treatment, the improvement continued so far that on my bawling a  question into his ear he actually opened his eyes for an instant, though  in another moment, the lids had sunk back into their former position.    Soon after this, Mr. Weiss re-entered the room, followed by Mrs.  Schallibaum, who carried a small tray, on which were a jug of coffee, a  jug of milk, a cup and saucer and a sugar basin.    \"How do you find him now?\" Mr. Weiss asked anxiously.    \"I am glad to say that there is a distinct improvement,\" I replied. \"But  we must persevere. He is by no means out of the wood yet.\"    I examined the coffee, which looked black and strong and had a very  reassuring smell, and, pouring out half a cupful, approached the bed.    \"Now, Mr. Graves,\" I shouted, \"we want you to drink some of this.\"    The flaccid eyelids lifted for an instant but there was no other  response. I gently opened the unresisting mouth and ladled in a couple  of spoonfuls of coffee, which were immediately swallowed; whereupon I  repeated the proceeding and continued at short intervals until the cup  was empty. The effect of the new remedy soon became apparent. He began  to mumble and mutter obscurely in response to the questions that I  bellowed at him, and once or twice he opened his eyes and looked  dreamily into my face. Then I sat him up and made him drink some coffee  from the cup, and, all the time, kept up a running fire of questions,  which made up in volume of sound for what they lacked of relevancy.    Of these proceedings Mr. Weiss and his housekeeper were highly  interested spectators, and the former, contrary to his usual practice,  came quite close up to the bed, to get a better view.    \"It is really a most remarkable thing,\" he said, \"but it almost looks as  if you were right, after all. He is certainly much better. But tell me,  would this treatment produce a similar improvement if the symptoms were  due to disease?\"    \"No,\" I answered, \"it certainly would not.\"    \"Then that seems to settle it. But it is a most mysterious affair. Can  you suggest any way in which he can have concealed a store of the drug?\"    I stood up and looked him straight in the face; it was the first chance  I had had of inspecting him by any but the feeblest light, and I looked  at him very attentively. Now, it is a curious fact--though one that most  persons must have observed--that there sometimes occurs a considerable  interval between the reception of a visual impression and its complete  transfer to the consciousness. A thing may be seen, as it were,  unconsciously, and the impression consigned, apparently, to instant  oblivion; and yet the picture may be subsequently revived by memory with  such completeness that its details can be studied as though the object  were still actually visible.    Something of this kind must have happened to me now. Preoccupied as I  was, by the condition of the patient, the professional habit of rapid  and close observation caused me to direct a searching glance at the man  before me. It was only a brief glance--for Mr. Weiss, perhaps  embarrassed by my keen regard of him, almost immediately withdrew into  the shadow--and my attention seemed principally to be occupied by the  odd contrast between the pallor of his face and the redness of his nose  and by the peculiar stiff, bristly character of his eyebrows. But there  was another fact, and a very curious one, that was observed by me  subconsciously and instantly forgotten, to be revived later when I  reflected on the events of the night. It was this:    As Mr. Weiss stood, with his head slightly turned, I was able to look  through one glass of his spectacles at the wall beyond. On the wall was  a framed print; and the edge of the frame, seen through the  spectacle-glass, appeared quite unaltered and free from distortion,  magnification or reduction, as if seen through plain window-glass; and  yet the reflections of the candle-flame in the spectacles showed the  flame upside down, proving conclusively that the glasses were concave on  one surface at least. The strange phenomenon was visible only for a  moment or two, and as it passed out of my sight it passed also out of my  mind.    \"No,\" I said, replying to the last question; \"I can think of no way in  which he could have effectually hidden a store of morphine. Judging by  the symptoms, he has taken a large dose, and, if he has been in the  habit of consuming large quantities, his stock would be pretty bulky. I  can offer no suggestion whatever.\"    \"I suppose you consider him quite out of danger now?\"    \"Oh, not at all. I think we can pull him round if we persevere, but he  must not be allowed to sink back into a state of coma. We must keep him  on the move until the effects of the drug have really passed off. If you  will put him into his dressing-gown we will walk him up and down the  room for a while.\"    \"But is that safe?\" Mr. Weiss asked anxiously.    \"Quite safe,\" I answered. \"I will watch his pulse carefully. The danger  is in the possibility, or rather certainty, of a relapse if he is not  kept moving.\"    With obvious unwillingness and disapproval, Mr. Weiss produced a  dressing-gown and together we invested the patient in it. Then we  dragged him, very limp, but not entirely unresisting, out of bed and  stood him on his feet. He opened his eyes and blinked owlishly first at  one and then at the other of us, and mumbled a few unintelligible words  of protest; regardless of which, we thrust his feet into slippers and  endeavoured to make him walk. At first he seemed unable to stand, and we  had to support him by his arms as we urged him forward; but presently  his trailing legs began to make definite walking movements, and, after  one or two turns up and down the room, he was not only able partly to  support his weight, but showed evidence of reviving consciousness in  more energetic protests.    At this point Mr. Weiss astonished me by transferring the arm that he  held to the housekeeper.    \"If you will excuse me, doctor,\" said he, \"I will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#9)"],[1,"thisaway. I  do have spells when I'm some lucid.\"    It was not much, but such as it was it stood for his oath of  allegiance.    Alexander P. Dill sat up straight, his long, bony fingers--which  Billy could still mentally see gripping the necks of those two in  the saloon--lying loosely upon the chair-arms. \"I hope you will  not mention the matter again,\" he said. \"I realize that this is not  Michigan, and that the temptations are--But we will not discuss it. I  shall be very grateful for your friendship, and--\"    \"Grateful!\" snorted Billy, spilling tobacco on the strip of faded  ingrain carpet before the bed. \"Grateful--hell!\"    Mr. Dill looked at him a moment and there was a certain keen  man-measuring behind the wistfulness. But he said no more about the  friendship of Charming Billy Boyle, which was as well.    That is why the two of them later sat apart on the sunny side of the  hotel \"office\"--which was also a saloon--and talked of many things,  but chiefly of the cattle industry as Montana knows it and of the  hopes and the aims of Alexander P. Dill. Perhaps, also, that is why  Billy breathed clean of whisky and had the bulk of his winter wages  still unspent in his pocket.    \"Looks to me,\" he was saying between puffs, \"like you'd uh stayed back  where yuh knew the lay uh the land, instead uh drifting out here where  it's all plumb strange to yuh.\"    \"Well, several incidents influenced my actions,\" Mr. Dill explained  quietly. \"I had always lived within twenty miles of my birthplace.  I owned a general store in a little place near the old farm, and did  well. The farm paid well, also. Then mother died and the place did  not seem quite the same. A railroad was built through the town and the  land I owned there rose enormously in value. I had a splendid location  for a modern store but I could not seem to make up my mind to change.  So I sold out everything--store, land, the home farm and all, and  received a good figure--a _very_ good figure. I was very fortunate in  owning practically the whole townsite--the new townsite, that is. I  do not like these so-called booms, however, and so I left to begin  somewhere else. I did not care to enter the mercantile business again,  and our doctor advised me to live as much as possible in the open air.  Mother died of consumption. So I decided to come West and buy a cattle  ranch. I believed I should like it. I always liked animals.\"    \"Uh-huh--so do I.\" It was not just what Charming Billy most wanted to  say, but that much was perfectly safe, and noncommittal to say.    Mr. Dill was silent a minute, looking speculatively across to  the Hardup Saloon which was practically empty and therefore quite  peaceful. Billy, because long living on the range made silence easy,  smoked and said nothing.    \"Mr. Boyle,\" began Dill at last, in the hesitating way that he had  used when Billy first met him, \"you say you know this country, and  have worked at cattle-raising for a good many years--\"    \"Twelve,\" supplemented Charming Billy. \"Turned my first cow when I was  sixteen.\"    \"So you must be perfectly familiar with the business. I frankly admit  that I am not familiar with it. You say you are at present out of  employment and so I am thinking seriously of offering you a position  myself, as confidential adviser if you like. I really need some  one who can accompany me about the country and keep me from such  deplorable blunders as was yesterday's experience. After I have bought  a place, I shall need some one who is familiar with the business and  will honestly work for my interests and assist me in the details until  I have myself gained a practical working-knowledge of it. I think I  can make such an arrangement to your advantage as well as my own. From  the start the salary would be what is usually paid to a foreman. What  do you say?\"    For an appreciable space Charming Billy Boyle did not say a word. He  was not stupid and he saw in a flash all the possibilities that lay in  the offer. To be next the very top--to have his say in the running of  a model cow-outfit--and it should be a model outfit if he took charge,  for he had ideas of his own about how these things should be  done--to be foreman, with the right to \"hire and fire\" at his own  discretion--He turned, flushed and bright-eyed, to Dill.    \"God knows why yuh cut _me_ out for the job,\" he said in a rather  astonished voice. \"What you've seen uh me, so far, ain't been what  I'd call a gilt-edge recommend. But if you're fool enough to mean it  serious, it's as I told yuh a while back: Yuh can count on me till  they're cutting figure-eights all over hell.\"    \"That, according to the scientists who are willing to concede the  existence of such a place, will be quite as long as I shall be likely  to have need of your loyalty,\" observed Mr. Dill, puckering his long  face into the first smile Billy had seen him attempt.    He did not intimate the fact that he had inquired very closely into  the record and the general range qualifications of Charming Billy  Boyle, sounding, for that purpose, every responsible man in Hardup.  With the new-born respect for him bred by his peculiarly efficacious  way of handling those who annoyed him beyond the limit, he was told  the truth and recognized it as such. So he was not really as rash and  as given over to his impulses as Billy, in his ignorance of the man,  fancied.    The modesty of Billy would probably have been shocked if he had heard  the testimony of his fellows concerning him. As it was, he was rather  dazed and a good deal inclined to wonder how Alexander P. Dill had  ever managed to accumulate enough capital to start anything--let  alone a cow-outfit--if he took on trust every man he met. He privately  believed that Dill had taken a long chance, and that he should  consider himself very lucky because he had accidentally picked a man  who would not \"steal him blind.\"           *       *       *       *       *    After that there were many days of riding to and fro, canvassing all  northern Montana in search of a location and an outfit that suited  them and that could be bought. And in the riding, Mr. Dill became  under the earnest tutelage of Charming Billy a shade less ignorant of  range ways and of the business of \"raising wild cattle for the Eastern  markets.\"    He even came to speak quite easily of \"outfits\" in all the nice shades  of meaning which are attached to that hard-worked term. He could lay  the saddle-blanket smooth and unwrinkled, slap the saddle on and cinch  it without fixing it either upon the withers or upon the rump of his  long-suffering mount. He could swing his quirt without damaging his  own person, and he rode with his stirrups where they should be to  accommodate the length of him--all of which speaks eloquently of the  honest intentions of Dill's confidential adviser.          CHAPTER VIII.    _Just a Day-dream._      Charming Billy rode humped over the saddle-horn, as rides one whose  mind feels the weight of unpleasant thoughts. Twice he had glanced  uncertainly at his companion, opening his lips for speech; twice he  had closed them silently and turned again to the uneven trail.    Mr. Dill also was humped forward in the saddle, but if one might judge  from his face it was because he was cold. The wind blew chill from out  the north and they were facing it; the trail they followed was frozen  hard and the gray clouds above promised snow. The cheek-bones of Dill  were purple and the point of his long nose was very red. Tears stood  in his eyes, whipped there by the biting wind.    \"How far are we now from town?\" he asked dispiritedly.    \"Only about five miles,\" Billy cheered. Then, as if trivial speech had  made easier what he had in mind to say, he turned resolutely toward  the other. \"Yuh expect to meet old man Robinson there, don't yuh?\"    \"That was the arrangement, as I understood it\"    \"And you're thinking strong of buying him out?\"    \"His place appeals to me more than any of the others, and--yes, it  seems to me that I can't do better.\" Mr. Dill turned the collar of his  coat up a bit farther--or fancied he did so--and looked questioningly  at Billy.    \"Yuh gave me leave to advise yuh where yuh needed it,\" Billy said  almost challengingly, \"and I'm going to call yuh, right here and now.  If yuh take my advice yuh won't go making medicine with old Robinson  any more. He'll do yuh, sure. He's asking yuh double what the outfit's  worth. They _all_ are. It looks to me like they think you're just out  here to get rid of your pile and the bigger chunk they can pry loose  from yuh the better. I was going to put yuh next before this, only yuh  didn't seem to take to any uh the places real serious, so it wasn't  necessary.\"    \"I realize that one cannot buy land and cattle for nothing,\" Dill  chuckled. \"It seemed to me that, compared with the prices others have  asked, Mr. Robinson's offer was very reasonable.\"    \"It may be lower than Jacobs and Wilter, but that don't make it  right.\"    \"Well, there were the Two Sevens\"--he meant the Seventy-Seven, but  that was a mere detail--\"I didn't get to see the owner, you know. I  have written East, however, and should hear from him in a few days.\"    \"Yuh ain't likely to do business with _that_ layout, because I don't  believe they'd sell at any price. Old Robinson is the washout yuh want  to ride around at present; I ain't worrying about the rest, right now.  He's a smooth old devil, and he'll do yuh sure.\"    To this Mr. Dill made no reply whatever. He fumbled the fastenings on  his coon-skin coat, tried to pull his cap lower and looked altogether  unhappy. And Charming Billy, not at ail sure that his advice would be  taken or his warning heeded, stuck the spurs into his horse and set a  faster pace reflecting gloomily upon the trials of being confidential  adviser to one who, in a perfectly mild and good-mannered fashion,  goes right along doing pretty much as he pleases."]]]
