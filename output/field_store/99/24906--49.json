Mrs. Gibson was the first to speak again. \"Well I'd like to have that  kind, but I'd like wonderfully well to try the other a while first.\"    Elsie looked at the thin, sallow face with its hollow cheeks and sunken  eyes, and wished mamma were there to talk of Jesus to this poor woman, who  surely had but little time to prepare for another world.    \"Is your mother at the Crags?\" asked Mrs. Gibson turning to her again.    Elsie answered in the affirmative, adding that they had been there for  some time and would probably remain a week or two longer.    \"Do you think she would be willing to come here to see me?\" was the next  question, almost eagerly put.    \"Mamma is very kind and I am sure she will come if you wish to see her,\"  answered the child.    \"Then tell her I do; tell her I, her old governess, am sick and poor and  in great trouble.\"    Tears rolled down her cheeks and for a moment her eyes rested upon her  daughter's face with an expression of keen anguish. \"She's going blind,\"  she whispered in Elsie's ear, drawing the child toward her, and nodding in  the direction of Sally, stitching away at the window.    \"Blind! oh how dreadful!\" exclaimed the little girl in low moved tones,  the tears springing to her eyes. \"I wish she could go to Doctor Thomson.\"    \"Doctor Thomson! who is he?\"    \"An oculist: he lives in Philadelphia. A friend of mamma's had something  growing over her eyes so that she was nearly blind, and he cut it off and  she can see now as well as anybody.\"    \"I don't think that is the trouble with Sally's; though of course I can't  tell. But she's always had poor sight, and now that she has to support the  family with her needle, her eyes are nearly worn out.\"    Sally had been for several minutes making vain attempts to thread a  needle.    Elsie sprang to her side with a kindly, eager, \"Let me do it, won't you?\"    It was done in a trice and the girl thanked her with lips and eyes.    \"It often takes me full five or ten minutes,\" she said, \"and sometimes I  have to get mother to do it for me.\"    \"What a pity! it must be a great hindrance to your work.\"    \"Yes, indeed, and my eyes ache so that I can seldom sew or read for more  than an hour or two at a time. Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to lose my sight  altogether.\"    The tone was inexpressibly mournful, and Elsie's eyes filled again.    \"Don't fret about it,\" she said, \"I think--I hope you can be cured.\"    The rain had nearly ceased, and Philip, saying the worst was over, and  they were in danger of being late at dinner, hurried the girls into the  phaeton.    \"What was that woman whispering to you?\" asked Gertrude, as soon as they  were fairly off.    Elsie looked uncomfortable. \"It was something I was to tell mamma,\" she  replied.    \"But what is it?\"    \"I'm afraid she wanted to keep it a secret from you, Gerty, or she would  have spoken out loud.\"    \"I think you're very mean and disobliging,\" retorted Gertrude, beginning  to pout.    \"No, she isn't,\" said Philip pompously, \"she's honorable, and one of the  few females who can keep a secret. But I overheard it, Elsie, and feel  pretty sure that the reason she whispered it, was to keep the poor girl  from hearing. It's very natural she shouldn't want her to know she's  afraid her sight's leaving her.\"    \"Oh, yes; I suppose that was it!\" returned Elsie. \"But you were very wise  to think of it, Phil.\"    \"Don't flatter him,\" said Gertrude; \"he thinks a great deal too much of  himself, already.\"    Dinner was just ready when they reached home, and their mammas were on the  porch looking for them.    \"So there you are at last! what detained you so long?\" said Mrs. Ross.    \"Went further than we intended; and then the rain, you know,\" said  Philip.    \"And, oh, we had an adventure!\" cried the girls, and hastened to tell it.    Mrs. Travilla had not forgotten her old governess, and though no pleasant  recollection of her lingered in her memory, neither was there any dislike  or revengeful feeling there. She heard of her sorrows with commiseration  and rejoiced in the ability to alleviate them.    \"That Mrs. Gibson!\" exclaimed Lucy, \"I've seen her many a time at the door  or window, in driving past, and have often thought there was something  familiar in her face, but never dreamed who she was. That hateful Miss  Day! as I used to call her; Elsie, I wouldn't do a thing for her, if I  were you. Why she treated you with absolute cruelty.\"    \"She was sometimes unjust and unkind,\" said Mrs. Travilla, smiling at her  friend's vehemence, \"but probably my sensitiveness, timidity and  stupidity, were often very trying.\"    \"No such thing!--if you will excuse me for contradicting you--everybody  that knew you then, would testify that you were the sweetest, dearest,  most patient, industrious little thing that ever was made.\"    Elsie laughed and shook her head, \"Ah, Lucy, you always flattered me;  never were jealous even when I was held up to you as a pattern an evidence  that yours was a remarkably sweet disposition. Now, tell me, please, if  you know anything about these Gibsons?\"    \"Not much; they came to that hut years ago, evidently very poor, and quite  as evidently--so report says--having seen better days. The husband and  father drank deeply, and the wife earned a scanty support for the family  by sewing and knitting; that is about all I know of them, except that  several of their children died of scarlet fever within a few days of each  other, soon after they came to the neighborhood, and that a year ago last  winter, the man, coming home very drunk, fell into a snow-drift, and next  day was found frozen to death. I was told at that time they had only two  children--a son who was following in his father's footsteps, and this  daughter.\"    \"Poor woman!\" sighed Elsie, \"she is sorely tried and afflicted. I must go  to her at once.\"    \"Do, mamma, and get a doctor for her,\" said little Elsie; \"she looked so  sick and miserable.\"    Mrs. Ross offered her carriage, and the shower having cooled the air,  Elsie went, shortly after the conclusion of the meal.          CHAPTER NINTH.             \"I'll not chide thee;      Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.\"                                     --SHAKESPEARE.      \"I never saw such a likeness in my life!\" said Mrs. Gibson looking after  the phaeton as it drove away; \"she's the very image of her mother. I could  just have believed it was the very little Elsie Dinsmore I used to teach  more than twenty years ago.\"    \"She's lovely!\" exclaimed Sally with enthusiasm. \"Mother, did you see what  a pretty watch she had?\"    \"Yes,\" gloomily; \"some folks seem to have nothing but prosperity, and  others nothing but poverty and losses and crosses. They're as rich as  Croesus and we have hardly enough to keep us from starving.\"    \"Better times may come,\" said Sally, trying to speak hopefully, \"Tom may  reform and go to work. I do think, mother, if you'd try to----\"    \"Hush! I'm a great deal better to him than he deserves.\"    It was some moments before Sally spoke again, then it was only to ask,  \"Will you have your dinner now, mother?\"    \"No; there's nothing in the house but bread and potatoes, and I couldn't  swallow either. Dear me what a table they used to set at Roselands! enough  to tempt the appetite of an epicure.\"    \"I must rest my eyes a little. I can't see any longer,\" said the girl,  laying down her work and going to the door.    \"It's just dreadful,\" sighed her mother, \"but don't get out of heart;  these people will help us and it is possible some skilful oculist may  understand your case and be able to help you.\"    The girl's eyes were fixed upon the distant mountain-tops where, through a  rift in the clouds the sun shone suddenly out for a moment. \"'I will lift  up mine eyes unto the hills whence cometh my help,'\" she murmured softly  to herself. Then from a full heart went up a strong cry, \"O God, my  Father, save me, I beseech thee, from this bitter trial that I so dread!  Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. Oh, help me to be content  with whatsoever thou shalt send!\"    \"Sally, you're standing there a long time.\" It was the mother's querulous  voice again.    The girl turned toward her, answering in a patient tone. \"Yes, mother, it  rests my eyes to look at the sky and the mountains or any distant object.\"    \"You'd better get yourself something to eat. It must be six or eight hours  at least since breakfast.\"    An hour later Sally, again busied with her sewing, by the window, lifted  her head at the sound of wheels and exclaimed in a low tone, \"There is the  same carriage again! It has stopped and a lady is getting out of it.\"    But turning her head she perceived that her mother, who was now lying on  the bed, had fallen asleep. Dropping her work, she stepped quickly to the  door in time to prevent a rap.    She recognized the lady at once from her likeness to her namesake  daughter, and holding out her hand with a joyful admiring smile said,  \"Mrs. Travilla, is it not? Thank you for coming. I am so glad, and mother  will be so delighted to see you; but she is sleeping just now.\"    She had spoken softly, and Elsie answered in the same subdued tone, as she  took the offered hand, then stepped in and sat down in a chair the girl  hastened to set for her, \"That is well; we must not wake her.\"    A long talk followed in which Elsie by her ready tact and sweet sympathy,  free from the slightest approach to patronage, drew from the girl the  story of their sorrows, privations and fears for the future.    Her mother had been gradually failing for some time, though she really did  not know what was the nature of the disease. For a while they had  contrived by their united efforts to make the two ends meet, but now that  all depended upon her, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#9)"],[1," now!    2. \"Foolhardy chaps who live in town,     What danger they are all in,     And now are quaking in their beds,     For fear the roof shall fall in;     Poor creatures, how they envy us,     And wish, as I've a notion,     For our good luck, in such a storm,     To be upon the ocean.    3. \"But as for them who're out all day,     On business from their houses,     And late at night are coming home,     To cheer the babes and spouses;     While you and I, Bill, on the deck,     Are comfortably lying,     My eyes! what tiles and chimney pots     About their heads are flying!    4. \"And very often have we heard     How men are killed and undone     By overturns of carriages,     By thieves, and fires in London.

XIX. TWO WAYS OF TELLING A STORY. (60)  By HENRY K. OLIVER.    1. In one of the most populous cities of New England, a few years ago, a  party of lads, all members of the same school, got up a grand sleigh ride.  The sleigh was a very large one, drawn by six gray horses.    2. On the following day, as the teacher entered the schoolroom, he found  his pupils in high glee, as they chattered about the fun and frolic of  their excursion. In answer to some inquiries, one of the lads gave him an  account of their trip and its various incidents.    3. As he drew near the end of his story, he exclaimed: \"Oh, sir! there was  one thing I had almost forgotten. As we were coming home, we saw ahead of  us a queer looking affair in the road. It proved to be a rusty old sleigh,  fastened behind a covered wagon, proceeding at a very slow rate, and  taking up the whole road.    4. \"Finding that the owner was not disposed to turn out, we determined  upon a volley of snowballs and a good hurrah. They produced the right  effect, for the crazy machine turned out into the deep snow, and the  skinny old pony started on a full trot.    5. \"As we passed, some one gave the horse a good crack, which made him run  faster than he ever did before, I'll warrant.    6. \"With that, an old fellow in the wagon, who was buried up under an old  hat, bawled out, 'Why do you frighten my horse?'  'Why don't you turn out,  then?' says the driver. So we gave him three rousing cheers more. His  horse was frightened again, and ran up against a loaded wagon, and, I  believe, almost capsized the old creature--and so we left him.\"    7. \"Well, boys,\" replied the teacher, \"take your seat\", and I will tell  you a story, and all about a sleigh ride, too. Yesterday afternoon a very  venerable old clergyman was on his way from Boston to Salem, to pass the  rest of the winter at the house of his son. That he might be prepared for  journeying in the following spring he took with him his wagon, and for the  winter his sleigh, which he fastened behind the wagon.    8. \"His sight and hearing were somewhat blunted by age, and he was  proceeding very slowly; for his horse was old and feeble, like his owner.  He was suddenly disturbed by loud hurrahs from behind, and by a furious  pelting of balls of snow and ice upon the top of his wagon.    9. \"In his alarm he dropped his reins, and his horse began to run away. In  the midst of the old man's trouble, there rushed by him, with loud shouts,  a large party of boys, in a sleigh drawn by six horses. 'Turn out! turn  out, old fellow!' 'Give us the road!' 'What will you take for your pony?'  'What's the price of oats, old man?' were the various cries that met his  cars.    10. \"'Pray, do not frighten my horse!' exclaimed the infirm driver. 'Turn  out, then! turn out!' was the answer, which was followed by repeated  cracks and blows from the long whip of the 'grand sleigh,' with showers of  snowballs, and three tremendous hurrahs from the boys.    11. \"The terror of the old man and his horse was increased, and the latter  ran away with him, to the great danger of his life. He contrived, however,  to stop his horse just in season to prevent his being dashed against a  loaded wagon. A short distance brought him to the house of his son. That  son, boys, is your instructor, and that 'old fellow,' was your teacher's  father!\"    12. When the boys perceived how rude and unkind their conduct appeared  from another point of view, they were very much ashamed of their  thoughtlessness, and most of them had the manliness to apologize to their  teacher for what they had done.      DEFINITIONS.-l. Pop'u-lous, full of inhabitants. 2. Ex-cur'-sion, a  pleasure trip. In'ci-dents, things that happen, events. 5. War'rant, to  declare with assurance. 6. Cap-sized', upset. 7. Ven'er-a-ble, deserving  of honor and respect. 8. Blunt'ed, dulled.      EXERCISES.--Repeat the boys' story of the sleigh ride. The teacher's  story. Were the boys ill-natured or only thoughtless? Is thoughtlessness  any excuse for rudeness or unkindness?        XX. FREAKS OF THE FROST. (63)    By Hannah Flagg Gould, who was born at Lancaster, Vermont, in 1789. She  published several volumes of poems (one for children) and one collection  of prose articles, entitled \"Gathered Leaves.\" She died in 1865.    1. The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,     And whispered, \"Now I shall be out of sight;     So through the valley and over the height       In silence I'll take my way;     I will not go on, like that blustering train,     The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,     Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,       But I'll be as busy as they.\"    2. Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest;     He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed     In diamond beads; and over the breast       Of the quivering lake, he spread     A coat of mail, that it need not fear     The downward point of many a spear,     That he hung on its margin, far and near,       Where a rock could rear its head.    3. He went to the windows of those who slept,     And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;     Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,       By the light of the morn were seen     Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;     There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees;     There were cities with temples and towers, and these       All pictured in silver sheen.    4. But he did one thing that was hardly fair;     He peeped in the cupboard, and, finding there     That all had forgotten for him to prepare,       \"Now just to set them a-thinking,     I'll bite this basket of fruit,\" said he,     \"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three;     And the glass of water they've left for me       Shall 'tchick!' to tell them I'm drinking.\"      DEFINITIONS.--l. Blus'ter-ing, being noisy and loud. Bus'tle, stir. 2.  Crest, the top. Quiv'er-ing, trembling, shaking. Mar'gin, edge, border. 3.  Bev'ies, flocks. Pic'tured, painted. Sheen, brightness, splendor of  appearance.      EXERCISES.--What did the frost say? What did he do to the mountain? The  trees? The lake? What is a \"coat of mail\"? What did he do to the window?  The pitcher?        XXI. WASTE NOT, WANT NOT. (64)    1. Mr. Jones. Boys, if you have nothing to do, will you unpack these  parcels for me?    2. The two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with good  whipcord. Ben took his parcel to the table, and began to examine the knot,  and then to untie it.    3. John took the other parcel, and tried first at one corner, and then at  the other, to pull off the string. But the cord had been too well secured,  and he only drew the knots tighter.    4. John. I wish these people would not tie up their parcels so tightly, as  if they were never to be undone. Why, Ben, how did you get yours undone?  What is in your parcel? I wonder what is in mine! I wish I could get the  string off. I will cut it.    5. Ben. Oh, no, do not cut it, John! Look, what a nice cord this is, and  yours is the same. It is a pity to cut it.    6. John. Pooh! what signifies a bit of pack thread?    7. Ben. It is whipcord.    8. John. Well, whipcord then! what signifies a bit of whipcord? You can  get a piece of whipcord twice as long as that for three cents; and who  cares for three cents? Not I, for one. So, here it goes.    9. So he took out his knife, and cut it in several places.    10. Mr. Jones. Well, my boys, have you undone the parcels for me?    11. John. Yes, sir; here is the parcel.    12. Ben. And here is my parcel, father, and here is also the string.    13. Mr. Jones. You may keep the string, Ben.    14. Ben. Thank you, sir. What excellent whipcord it is!    15. Mr. Jones. And you, John, may keep your string, too, if it will be of  any use to you.    16. John. It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir.    17.  Mr. Jones. No, I am afraid not, if this is it.    18. A few weeks after this, Mr. Jones gave each of his sons a new top.    19. John. How is this, Ben? These tops have no strings. What shall we do  for strings?    20. Ben. I have a string that will do very well for mine. And he pulled it  out of his pocket.    21. John. Why, if that is not the whipcord! I wish I had saved mine.    22. A few days afterward, there was a shooting match, with bows and  arrows, among the lads. The prize was a fine bow and arrows, to be given  to the best marksman. \"Come, come,\" said Master Sharp, \"I am within one  inch of the mark. I should like to see who will go nearer.\"    23. John drew his bow, and shot. The arrow struck within a"]]]
