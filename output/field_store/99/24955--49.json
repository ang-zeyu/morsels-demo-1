In this manner--the memorandum concludes--it may be hoped that by    co-ordinating all the particulars of this proposition with the    fundamental idea of reforming the Jewish people, and _by taking    compulsory measures to aid_, the goal of the Government will be    attained.    As a result of this _expose_ of the Council of State, an imperial  rescript was issued on December 27, 1840, calling for the establishment  of a \"Committee for Defining Measures looking to the Radical  Transformation of the Jews of Russia.\" Count Kiselev, Minister of the  Crown Domains, was appointed chairman. The other members included the  Ministers of Public Instruction and the Interior, the Assistant-Minister  of Finance, the Director of the Second Section of the imperial  chancellery, and the Chief of the Political Police, or the dreaded  \"Third Section.\" [1] The latter was entrusted with the special task \"to  keep a watchful eye on the intrigues and actions which may be resorted  to by the Jews during the execution of this matter.\"    [Footnote 1: See p. 21, n. 1.]    Moreover, the _expose_ of the Council of State, which was to serve as  the program of the new Committee, was sent out to the governors-general  of the Western region [1] \"confidentially_, for personal information and  consideration.\" The reformatory campaign against the Jews was thus  started without any formal declaration of war, under the guise of  secrecy and surrounded by police precautions. The procedure to be  followed by the Committee was to consider the project in the order  indicated in the memorandum: first \"enlightenment,\" then abolition of  autonomy, and finally disabilities.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 16, n. 1.]      2. UVAROV AND LILIENTHAL    An elaborate _expose_ on the question of enlightenment was composed and  laid before the Committee by the Minister of Public Instruction, Sergius  Uvarov. Having acquired the _bon ton_ of Western Europe, Uvarov prefaces  his statement by the remark that the European governments have abandoned  the method of \"persecution and compulsion\" in solving the Jewish  question and that \"this period has also arrived for us.\" \"Nations,\"  observes Uvarov, \"are not exterminated, least of all the nation which  stood at the foot of Calvary.\" From what follows, it seems evident that  the Minister is still in hopes that the gentle measures of enlightenment  may attract the Jews towards the religion which derives its origin from  Calvary.      The best among the Jews--he states--are conscious of the fact that    one of the principal causes of their humiliation lies in the    perverted interpretation of their religious traditions, that ... the    Talmud demoralized and continues to demoralize their    co-religionists. But nowhere is the influence of the Talmud so    potent as among us (in Russia) and in the Kingdom of Poland. [1]    This influence can be counteracted only by enlightenment, and the    Government can do no better than to act in the spirit that animates    the handful of the best among them.... The re-education of the    learned section among the Jews involves at the same time the    purification of their religious conceptions.    [Footnote 1: See on the meaning of the latter term Vol. I, p. 390, n. 1.]    What \"purification\" the author of the memorandum has in mind may be  gathered from his casual remark that the Jews, who maintain their  separatism, are rightly afraid of reforms: \"for is not the religion of  the Cross the purest symbol of universal citizenship?\" This, however,  Uvarov cautiously adds, should not be made public, for \"it would have no  other effect except that of arousing from the very beginning the  opposition of the majority of the Jews against the (projected) schools.\"    Officially the reform must confine itself to the opening in all the  cities of the Jewish Pale of elementary and secondary schools in which  Jewish children should be taught the Russian language, secular sciences,  Hebrew, and \"religion, according to the Holy Writ.\" The instruction  should be given in Russian, though, owing to the shortage in teachers  familiar with this language, the use of German is to be admitted  temporarily. The teachers in the low-grade schools shall provisionally  be recruited from among melammeds who \"can be depended upon\"; those in  the higher-grade schools shall be chosen from among the modernized Jews  of Russia and Germany.    The Committee endorsed Uvarov's scheme in its principal features, and  urgently recommended that, in order to prepare the Jewish masses for the  impending reform, a special propagandist be sent into the Pale of  Settlement for the purpose of acquainting this obstreperous nation with  \"the benevolent intentions of the Government.\" Such a propagandist was  soon found in the person of a young German Jew, Dr. Max Lilienthal, a  resident of Riga.    Lilienthal; who was a native of Bavaria (he was born in Munich in 1815)  and a German university graduate, was a typical representative of the  German Jewish intellectuals of that period, a champion of assimilation  and of moderate religious reform. Lilienthal had scarcely completed his  university course, when he was offered by a group of educated Jews in  Riga the post of preacher and director of the new local Jewish school,  one of the three modern Jewish schools then in existence in Russia.[1]  In a short time Lilienthal managed to raise the instruction in  secular and Jewish subjects to such a high standard of modernity that he  elicited a glowing tribute from Uvarov. The Minister was struck by the  idea that the Riga school might serve as a model for the net of schools  with which he was about to cover the whole Pale of Settlement, and  Lilienthal seemed the logical man for carrying out the planned reforms.    [Footnote 1: The other two schools were located in Odessa and in  Kishinev.]    In February, 1841, Lilienthal was summoned to St. Petersburg, where he  had a prolonged conversation with Uvarov. According to the testimony of  the official Russian sources, he tried to persuade the Minister to  abolish all \"private schools,\" the heders, and to forbid all private  teachers, the melammeds, to teach even temporarily in the projected new  schools, and to import, instead, the whole teaching staff from Germany.  Lilienthal himself tells us in his Memoirs that he made bold to remind  the Minister that all obstacles in the path of the desired re-education  of the Russian Jews would disappear, were the Tzar to grant them  complete emancipation. To this the Minister retorted that the initiative  must come from the Jews themselves who first must try to \"deserve the  favor of the Sovereign.\" At any rate, Lilienthal accepted the proffered  task. He was commissioned to tour the Pale of Settlement, to organize  there the few isolated progressive Jews, \"the lovers of enlightenment,\"  or Maskilim, as they styled themselves, and to propagate the idea of a  school-reform among the orthodox Jewish masses.    While setting out on his journey, Lilienthal himself did not fully  realize the difficulties of the task he had undertaken. He was to  instill confidence in the \"benevolent intentions of the Government\" into  the hearts of a people which by an uninterrupted series of persecutions  and cruel restrictions had been reduced to the level of pariahs. He was  to make them believe that the Government was a well-wisher of Jewish  children, those same children, who at that very time were hunted like  wild beasts by the \"captors\" in the streets of the Pale, who were turned  by the thousands into soldiers, deported into outlying provinces, and  belabored in such a manner that scarcely half of them remained alive and  barely a tenth remained within the Jewish fold. Guided by an infallible  instinct, the plain Jewish people formulated their own simplified theory  to account for the step taken by the Government: up to the present their  children had been baptized through the barracks, in the future they  would be baptized through the additional medium of the school.    Lilienthal arrived in Vilna in the beginning of 1842, and, calling a  meeting of the Jewish Community, explained the plan conceived by the  Government and by Uvarov, \"the friend of the Jews.\" He was listened to  with unveiled distrust.      The elders--Lilienthal tells us in his Memoirs [1]--sat there    absorbed in deep contemplation. Some of them, leaning on their    silver-adorned staffs or smoothing their long beards, seemed as if    agitated by earnest thoughts and justifiable suspicions; others were    engaging in a lively but quiet discussion on the principles    involved; such put to me the ominous question: \"Doctor, are you    fully acquainted with the leading principles of our government? You    are a stranger; do you know what you are undertaking? The course    pursued against all denominations but the Greek proves clearly that    the Government intends to have but one Church in the whole Empire;    that it has in view only its own future strength and greatness and    not our own future prosperity. We are sorry to state that we put no    confidence in the new measures proposed by the ministerial council,    and that we look with gloomy foreboding into the future.\"    [Footnote 1: I quote from _Max Lilienthal, American Rabbi, Life and  Writings_, by David Philipson, New York, 1915, p, 264.]    In his reply Lilienthal advanced an impressive array of arguments:      What will you gain by your resistance to the new measures? It will    only irritate the Government, and will determine it to pursue its    system of repression, while at present you are offered an    opportunity to prove that the Jews are not enemies of culture and    deserve a better lot.

It was obvious that Roylston had rather  minimized his own importance. Urrea flicked the mane of his mustang with  a small whip and replied:    \"Our President and General, the illustrious Santa Anna, is extremely  anxious to see him. Secrets of state are not for me. I merely seek to do  my work.\"    \"Then you take this from me,\" said the Panther, a blunt frontiersman,  \"my comrades an' me ain't buyin' our lives at the price of nobody  else's.\"    \"You feel that way about it, do you?\"    \"That's just the way we feel, and I want to say, too, that I wouldn't  take the word of either you or your Santa Anna. If we was to give up Mr.  Roylston--which we don't dream of doin'--you'd be after us as hot an'  strong as ever.\"    Urrea's swarthy cheeks flushed again.    \"I shall not notice your insults,\" he said. \"They are beneath me. I am a  Mexican officer and gentleman, and you are mere riders of the plains.\"    \"All the same,\" said the Panther grimly, \"if you are goin' to talk you  have to talk with us.\"    \"That is true,\" said Urrea lightly, having regained complete control of  his temper. \"In war one cannot choose his enemies. I make you the  proposition once more. Give us Roylston and go. If you do not accept we  shall nevertheless take him and all of you who do not fall first.  Remember that you are rebels and traitors and that you will surely be  shot or hanged.\"    \"I don't remember any of them things,\" said the Panther grimly. \"What I  do remember is that we are Texans fightin' fur our rights. To hang a man  you've first got to catch him, an' to shoot him you've first got to hit  him. An' since things are to be remembered, remember that what you are  tryin' to do to us we may first do to you. An' with that I reckon we'll  bid you good day, Mr. Urrea.\"    Urrea bowed, but said nothing. He rode back toward his men, and Ned and  the Panther returned to the grove. Roylston was much better that morning  and he was able to stand, leaning against a tree.    \"May I ask the result of your conference,\" he said.    \"There ain't no secret about it,\" replied the Panther, \"but them  Mexicans seem to be almighty fond of you, Mr. Roylston.\"    \"In what way did they show it?\"    \"Urrea said that all of us could go if we would give up you.\"    \"And your answer?\"    The Panther leaned forward a little on his horse.    \"You know something about the Texans, don't you, Mr. Roylston?\"    \"I have had much opportunity to observe and study them.\"    \"Well, they've got plenty of faults, but you haven't heard of them  buyin' their lives at the price of a comrade's, have you?\"    \"I have not, but I wish to say, Mr. Palmer, that I'm sorry you returned  this answer. I should gladly take my chances if the rest of you could  go.\"    \"We'd never think of it,\" said the Panther. \"Besides, them Mexicans  wouldn't keep their word. They're goin' to besiege us here, hopin' maybe  that starvation or thirst will make us give you up. Now the first thing  for us to do is to get water for the horses.\"    This presented a problem, as the horses could not go down to the creek,  owing to the steep high banks, but the Texans soon solved it. The cliff  was soft and they quickly cut a smooth sloping path with their knives  and hatchets. Old Jack was the first to walk down it and Ned led him.  The horse hung back a little, but Ned patted his head and talked to him  as a friend and equal. Under such persuasion Old Jack finally made the  venture, and when he landed safely at the bottom he drank eagerly. Then  the other two horses followed. Meanwhile two riflemen kept a keen watch  up and down the creek bed for lurking Mexican sharpshooters.    But the watering of the horses was finished without incident, and they  were tethered once more in the thicket. Fields and another man kept a  watch upon the plain, and the rest conferred under the trees. The  Panther announced that by a great reduction of rations the food could be  made to last two days longer. It was not a cheerful statement, as the  Mexicans must know the scanty nature of their supplies, and would wait  with all the patience of Indians.    \"All things, including starvation, come to him who waits long enough,\"  said Obed White soberly.    \"We'll jest set the day through,\" said the Panther, \"an' see what turns  up.\"    But the day was quite peaceful. It was warmer than usual and bright with  sunshine. The Mexicans appeared on some of the knolls, seemingly near in  the thin clear air, but far enough away to be out of rifle shot, and  began to play cards or loll on their serapes. Several went to sleep.    \"They mean to show us that they have all the time in the world,\" said  Ned to Will, \"and that they are willing to wait until we fall like ripe  apples into their hands.\"    \"Do you think they will get us again?\" asked Will anxiously.    \"I don't. We've got food for two days and I believe that something will  happen in our favor within that time. Do you notice, Will, that it's  beginning to cloud up again? In winter you can't depend upon bright  sunshine to last always. I think we're going to have a dark night and  it's given me an idea.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I won't tell you, because it may amount to nothing. It all depends upon  what kind of night we have.\"    The sun did not return. The clouds banked up more heavily, and in the  afternoon Ned went to the Panther. They talked together earnestly,  looking frequently at the skies, and the faces of both expressed  satisfaction. Then they entered the bed of the creek and examined it  critically. Will was watching them. When the two separated and Ned came  toward him, he said:    \"I can guess your idea now. We mean to escape to-night up the bed of the  creek.\"    Ned nodded.    \"Your first guess is good,\" he said. \"If the promise of a dark night  keeps up we're going to try.\"    The promise was fulfilled. The Mexicans made no hostile movement  throughout the afternoon, but they maintained a rigid watch.    When the sun had set and the thick night had come down the Panther told  of the daring enterprise they were about to undertake, and all approved.  By nine o'clock the darkness was complete, and the little band gathered  at the point where the path was cut down into the bed of the creek. It  was likely that Mexicans were on all sides of the grove, but the Panther  did not believe that any of them, owing to bitter experience, would  enter the cut made by the stream. But, as leader, he insisted upon the  least possible noise. The greatest difficulty would be with the horses.  Ned, at the head of Old Jack, led the way.    Old Jack made the descent without slipping and in a few minutes the  entire force stood upon the sand. They had made no sound that any one  could have heard thirty yards away.    \"Now Mr. Roylston,\" whispered the Panther to the merchant, \"you get on  Ned's horse an' we'll be off.\"    Roylston sighed. It hurt his pride that he should be a burden, but he  was a man of few words, and he mounted in silence. Then they moved  slowly over the soft sand. They had loaded the extra rifles and muskets  on the other two horses, but every man remained thoroughly armed and  ready on the instant for any emergency.    The Panther and Obed led. Just behind them came Ned and Will. They went  very slowly in order to keep the horses' feet from making any sound that  listening Mexican sentinels might hear. They were fortunate in the sand,  which was fine and soundless like a carpet. Ned thought that the  Mexicans would not make any attempt upon the grove until late at night,  and then only with skirmishers and snipers. Or they might not make any  attempt at all, content with their cordon.    But it was thrilling work as they crept along on the soft sand in the  darkness and between the high banks. Ned felt a prickling of the blood.  An incautious footstep or a stumble by one of the horses might bring the  whole Mexican force down upon them at any moment. But there was no  incautious footstep. Nor did any horse stumble. The silent procession  moved on, passed the curve in the bed of the creek and continued its  course.    Urrea had surrounded the grove completely. His men were on both sides of  the creek, but no sound came to them, and they had a healthy respect  for the deadly Texan rifles. Their leader had certainly been wise in  deciding to starve them out. Meanwhile the little procession in the bed  of the creek increased its speed slightly.    The Texans were now a full four hundred yards from the grove, and their  confidence was rising.    \"If they don't discover our absence until morning,\" whispered Ned to  Will, \"we'll surely get away.\"    \"Then I hope they won't discover it until then,\" said Will fervently. \"I  don't want to die in battle just now, nor do I want to be executed in  Mexico for a rebel or for anything else.\"    They were now a full mile from the grove and the banks of the creek were  decreasing in height. They did not rise anywhere more than three or four  feet. But the water increased in depth and the margin of sand was  narrower. The Panther called a halt and they listened. They heard no  sound but the faint moaning of the wind among the dips and swells, and  the long lone howl of a lonesome coyote.    \"We've slipped through 'em! By the great horn spoon, we've slipped  through 'em!\" said the Panther exultantly. \"Now, boys, we'll take to the  water here to throw 'em off our track, when they try to follow it in the  mornin'.\"    The creek was now about three feet in depth and flowing slowly like most  streams in that region, but over a bed of hard sand, where the trace of  a footstep would quickly vanish.    \"The water is likely to be cold,\" said the Panther, \"an' if any fellow  is afraid of it he can stay behind and consort with the Mexicans who  don't care much for water.\"    \"Lead on, Macduff,\" said Obed, \"and there's nobody who will cry 'hold,  enough.'\"    The Panther"]]]
