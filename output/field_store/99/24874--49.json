In the autumn of 1791 he is again in Corsica  on furlough, and remains there until the month of May following. He  finds the island rent by strifes which it would be tedious to  describe. Suffice it to say that the breach between Paoli and the  Buonapartes gradually widened owing to the dictator's suspicion of all  who favoured the French Revolution. The young officer certainly did  nothing to close the breach. Determined to secure his own election as  lieutenant-colonel in the new Corsican National Guard, he spent much  time in gaining recruits who would vote for him. He further assured  his success by having one of the commissioners, who was acting in  Paoli's interest, carried off from his friends and detained at the  Buonapartes' house in Ajaccio--his first _coup_[16] Stranger events  were to follow. At Easter, when the people were excited by the  persecuting edicts against the clergy and the closing of a monastery,  there was sharp fighting between the populace and Buonaparte's  companies of National Guards. Originating in a petty quarrel, which  was taken up by eager partisans, it embroiled the whole of the town  and gave the ardent young Jacobin the chance of overthrowing his  enemies. His plans even extended to the seizure of the citadel, where  he tried to seduce the French regiment from its duty to officers  whom he dubbed aristocrats. The attempt was a failure. The whole  truth can, perhaps, scarcely be discerned amidst the tissue of  lies which speedily enveloped the affair; but there can be no  doubt that on the second day of strife Buonaparte's National  Guards began the fight and subsequently menaced the regular troops in  the citadel. The conflict was finally stopped by commissioners sent by  Paoli; and the volunteers were sent away from the town.    Buonaparte's position now seemed desperate. His conduct exposed him to  the hatred of most of his fellow-citizens and to the rebukes of the  French War Department. In fact, he had doubly sinned: he had actually  exceeded his furlough by four months: he was technically guilty, first  of desertion, and secondly of treason. In ordinary times he would have  been shot, but the times were extraordinary, and he rightly judged  that when a Continental war was brewing, the most daring course was  also the most prudent, namely, to go to Paris. Thither Paoli allowed  him to proceed, doubtless on the principle of giving the young madcap  a rope wherewith to hang himself.    On his arrival at Marseilles, he hears that war has been declared by  France against Austria; for the republican Ministry, which Louis XVI.  had recently been compelled to accept, believed that war against an  absolute monarch would intensify revolutionary fervour in France and  hasten the advent of the Republic. Their surmises were correct.  Buonaparte, on his arrival at Paris, witnessed the closing scenes of  the reign of Louis XVI. On June 20th he saw the crowd burst into the  Tuileries, when for some hours it insulted the king and queen. Warmly  though he had espoused the principles of the Revolution, his patrician  blood boiled at the sight of these vulgar outrages, and he exclaimed:  \"Why don't they sweep off four or five hundred of that _canaille_ with  cannon? The rest would then run away fast enough.\" The remark is  significant. If his brain approved the Jacobin creed, his instincts  were always with monarchy. His career was to reconcile his reason with  his instincts, and to impose on weary France the curious compromise of  a revolutionary Imperialism.    On August 10th, from the window of a shop near the Tuileries, he  looked down on the strange events which dealt the _coup de grace_ to  the dying monarchy. Again the chieftain within him sided against the  vulture rabble and with the well-meaning monarch who kept his troops  to a tame defensive. \"If Louis XVI.\" (so wrote Buonaparte to his  brother Joseph) \"had mounted his horse, the victory would have been  his--so I judge from the spirit which prevailed in the morning.\"  When all was over, when Louis sheathed his sword and went for  shelter to the National Assembly, when the fierce Marseillais were  slaughtering the Swiss Guards and bodyguards of the king, Buonaparte  dashed forward to save one of these unfortunates from a southern  sabre. \"Southern comrade, let us save this poor wretch.--Are you  of the south?--Yes.--Well, we will save him.\"    Altogether, what a time of disillusionment this was to the young  officer. What depths of cruelty and obscenity it revealed in the  Parisian rabble. What folly to treat them with the Christian  forbearance shown by Louis XVI. How much more suitable was grapeshot  than the beatitudes. The lesson was stored up for future use at a  somewhat similar crisis on this very spot.    During the few days when victorious Paris left Louis with the sham  title of king, Buonaparte received his captain's commission, which was  signed for the king by Servan, the War Minister. Thus did the  revolutionary Government pass over his double breach of military  discipline at Ajaccio. The revolutionary motto, \"La carriere ouverte  aux talents,\" was never more conspicuously illustrated than in the  facile condoning of his offences and in this rapid promotion. It was  indeed a time fraught with vast possibilities for all republican or  Jacobinical officers. Their monarchist colleagues were streaming over  the frontiers to join the Austrian and Prussian invaders. But National  Guards were enrolling by tens of thousands to drive out the Prussian  and Austrian invaders; and when Europe looked to see France fall for  ever, it saw with wonder her strength renewed as by enchantment. Later  on it learnt that that strength was the strength of Antaeus, of a  peasantry that stood firmly rooted in their native soil. Organization  and good leadership alone were needed to transform these ardent masses  into the most formidable soldiery; and the brilliant military  prospects now opened up certainly knit Buonaparte's feelings more  closely with the cause of France. Thus, on September 21st, when the  new National Assembly, known as the Convention, proclaimed the  Republic, we may well believe that sincere convictions no less than  astute calculations moved him to do and dare all things for the sake  of the new democratic commonwealth.[17]    For the present, however, a family duty urges him to return to  Corsica. He obtains permission to escort home his sister Elise, and  for the third time we find him on furlough in Corsica. This laxity of  military discipline at such a crisis is explicable only on the  supposition that the revolutionary chiefs knew of his devotion to  their cause and believed that his influence in the island would render  his informal services there more valuable than his regimental duties  in the army then invading Savoy. For the word Republic, which fired  his imagination, was an offence to Paoli and to most of the  islanders; and the phrase \"Republic one and indivisible,\" ever on the  lips of the French, seemed to promise that the island must become a  petty replica of France--France that was now dominated by the authors  of the vile September massacres. The French party in the island was  therefore rapidly declining, and Paoli was preparing to sever the  union with France. For this he has been bitterly assailed as a  traitor. But, from Paoli's point of view, the acquisition of the  island by France was a piece of rank treachery; and his allegiance to  France was technically at an end when the king was forcibly dethroned  and the Republic was proclaimed. The use of the appellation \"traitor\"  in such a case is merely a piece of childish abuse. It can be  justified neither by reference to law, equity, nor to the popular  sentiment of the time. Facts were soon to show that the islanders were  bitterly opposed to the party then dominant in France. This hostility  of a clannish, religious, and conservative populace against the  bloodthirsty and atheistical innovators who then lorded it over France  was not diminished by the action of some six thousand French  volunteers, the off-scourings of the southern ports, who were landed  at Ajaccio for an expedition against Sardinia. In their zeal for  Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, these _bonnets rouges_ came to  blows with the men of Ajaccio, three of whom they hanged. So fierce  was the resentment caused by this outrage that the plan of a joint  expedition for the liberation of Sardinia from monarchical tyranny had  to be modified; and Buonaparte, who was again in command of a  battalion of Corsican guards, proposed that the islanders alone should  proceed to attack the Madalena Isles.    These islands, situated between Corsica and Sardinia, have a double  interest to the historical student. One of them, Caprera, was destined  to shelter another Italian hero at the close of his career, the noble  self-denying Garibaldi: the chief island of the group was the  objective of Buonaparte's first essay in regular warfare. After some  delays the little force set sail under the command of Cesari-Colonna,  the nephew of Paoli. According to Buonaparte's own official statement  at the close of the affair, he had successfully landed his men near  the town to be assailed, and had thrown the Sardinian defences into  confusion, when a treacherous order from his chief bade him to cease  firing and return to the vessels. It has also been stated that this  retreat was the outcome of a secret understanding between Paoli and  Cesari-Colonna that the expedition should miscarry. This seems highly  probable. A mutiny on board the chief ship of the flotilla was  assigned by Cesari-Colonna as the cause of his order for a retreat;  but there are mutinies and mutinies, and this one may have been a  trick of the Paolists for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#9)"],[1,"public but the very foundation upon which social life is  built.    Rule of etiquette the first--which hundreds of others merely paraphrase or  explain or elaborate--is:    Never do anything that is unpleasant to others.    Never take more than your share--whether of the road in driving a car, of  chairs on a boat or seats on a train, or food at the table.    People who picnic along the public highway leaving a clutter of greasy  paper and swill (not, a pretty name, but neither is it a pretty object!)  for other people to walk or drive past, and to make a breeding place for  flies, and furnish nourishment for rats, choose a disgusting way to repay  the land-owner for the liberty they took in temporarily occupying his  property.          CHAPTER VI    AT THE OPERA, THE THEATER, AND OTHER PUBLIC GATHERINGS      Excepting a religious ceremonial, there is no occasion where greater  dignity of manner is required of ladies and gentlemen both, than in  occupying a box at the opera. For a gentleman especially no other  etiquette is so exacting.    In walking about in the foyer of the opera house, a gentleman leaves his  coat in the box--or in his orchestra chair--but he always wears his high  hat. The \"collapsible\" hat is for use in the seats rather than in the  boxes, but it can be worn perfectly well by a guest in the latter if he  hasn't a \"silk\" one. A gentleman must always be in full dress, tail coat,  white waistcoat, white tie and white gloves whether he is seated in the  orchestra or a box. He wears white gloves nowhere else except at a ball,  or when usher at a wedding.    As people usually dine with their hostess before the opera, they arrive  together; the gentlemen assist the ladies to lay off their wraps, one of  the gentlemen (whichever is nearest) draws back the curtain dividing the  ante-room from the box, and the ladies enter, followed by the gentlemen,  the last of whom closes the curtain again. If there are two ladies besides  the hostess, the latter places her most distinguished or older guest in  the corner nearest the stage. The seat furthest from the stage is always  her own. The older guest takes her seat first, then the hostess takes her  place, whereupon the third lady goes forward in the center to the front of  the box, and stands until one of the gentlemen places a chair for her  between the other two. (The chairs are arranged in three rows, of one on  either side with an aisle left between.)    One of the duties of the gentlemen is to see that the curtains at the back  of the box remain tightly closed, as the light from the ante-room shining  in the faces of others in the audience across the house is very  disagreeable to them.    A gentleman never sits in the front row of a box, even though he is for a  time alone in it.      =AS TO VISITING=    It is the custom for a gentleman who is a guest in one box to pay visits  to friends in other boxes during the entr'actes. He must visit none but  ladies of his acquaintance and must never enter a box in which he knows  only the gentlemen, and expect to be introduced to the ladies. If Arthur  Norman, for instance, wishes to present a gentleman to Mrs. Gilding in her  box at the opera, he must first ask her if he may bring his friend James  Dawson. (He would on no account speak of him as Mr. Dawson unless he is an  elderly person.) A lady's box at the opera is actually her house, and only  those who are acceptable as visitors in her house should ask to be  admitted.    But it is quite correct for a gentleman to go into a stranger's box to  speak to a lady who is a friend of his, just as he would go to see her if  she were staying in a stranger's house. But he should not go into the box  of one he does not know, to speak to a lady with whom he has only a slight  acquaintance, since visits are not paid quite so casually to ladies who  are themselves visitors. Upon a gentleman's entering a box it is  obligatory for whoever is sitting behind the lady to whom the arriving  gentleman's visit is addressed, to relinquish his chair. Another point of  etiquette is that a gentleman must never leave the ladies of his own box  alone. Occasionally it happens that the gentlemen in Mrs. Gilding's box,  for instance, have all relinquished their places to visitors and have  themselves gone to Mrs. Worldly's or Mrs. Jones' or Mrs. Town's boxes.  Mrs. Gilding's guests must, from the vantage point of the Worldly, Jones  or Town boxes, keep a watchful eye on their hostess and instantly return  to her support when they see her visitors about to leave, even though the  ladies whom they are momentarily visiting be left to themselves. It is of  course the duty of the other gentlemen who came to the opera with Mrs.  Worldly, Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Town to hurry to them.    A gentleman must never stay in any box that he does not belong in, after  the lowering of the lights for the curtain. Nor, in spite of cartoons to  the contrary, does good taste permit conversation during the performance  or during the overture. Box holders arriving late or leaving before the  final curtain do so as quietly as possible and always without speaking.      =A \"BRILLIANT OPERA NIGHT\"=    A \"brilliant opera night,\" which one often hears spoken of (meaning merely  that all the boxes are occupied, and that the ladies are more elaborately  dressed than usual) is generally a night when a leader of fashion such as  Mrs. Worldly, Mrs. Gilding, or Mrs. Toplofty, is giving a ball; and most  of the holders of the parterre boxes are in ball dresses, with an unusual  display of jewels. Or a house will be particularly \"brilliant\" if a very  great singer is appearing in a new role, or if a personage be present, as  when Marshal Joffre went to the Metropolitan.      =AFTER THE PERFORMANCE=    One gentleman, at least, must wait in the carriage lobby until all the  ladies in his party have driven away. _Never_ under any circumstances may  \"the last\" gentleman leave a lady standing alone on the sidewalk. It is  the duty of the hostess to take all unattended ladies home who have not a  private conveyance of their own, but the obligation does not extend to  married couples or odd men. But if a married lady or widow has ordered her  own car to come for her, the odd gentleman waits with her until it  appears. It is then considerate for her to offer him a \"lift,\" but it is  equally proper for her to thank him for waiting and drive off alone.      =AT THE THEATER=    New Yorkers of highest fashion almost never occupy a box at the theater.  At the opera the world of fashion is to be seen in the parterre boxes (not  the first tier), and in boxes at some of the horse shows and at many  public charity balls and entertainments, but those in boxes at the theater  are usually \"strangers\" or \"outsiders.\"    No one can dispute that the best theater seats are those in the center of  the orchestra. A box in these days of hatlessness has nothing to recommend  it except that the people can sit in a group and gentlemen can go out  between the acts easily, but these advantages hardly make up for the  disadvantage to four or at least three out of the six box occupants who  see scarcely a slice of the stage.      =WILL YOU DINE AND GO TO THE PLAY?=    There is no more popular or agreeable way of entertaining people than to  ask them to \"dine and go to the play.\" The majority do not even prefer to  have \"opera\" substituted for \"play,\" because those who care for serious  music are a minority compared with those who like the theater.    If a bachelor gives a small theater party he usually takes his guests to  dine at the Fitz-Cherry or some other fashionable and \"amusing\"  restaurant, but a married couple living in their own house are more likely  to dine at home, unless they belong to a type prevalent in New York which  is \"restaurant mad.\" The Gildings, in spite of the fact that their own  chef is the best there is, are much more apt to dine in a restaurant  before going to a play--or if they don't dine in a restaurant, they go to  one for supper afterwards. But the Normans, if they ask people to dine and  go to the theater, invariably dine at home.    A theater party can of course be of any size, but six or eight is the  usual number, and the invitations are telephoned: \"Will Mr. and Mrs.  Lovejoy dine with Mr. and Mrs. Norman at seven-thirty on Tuesday and go to  the play?\"    Or \"Will Mr. and Mrs. Oldname dine with Mr. Clubwin Doe on Saturday at the  Toit d'Or and go to the play?\"    When Mr. and Mrs. Oldname \"accept with pleasure\" a second message is  given: \"Dinner will be at 7.30.\"    Mrs. Norman's guests go to her house. Mr. Doe's guests meet him in the  foyer of the Toit d'Or. But the guests at both dinners are taken to the  theater by their host. If a dinner is given by a hostess who has no car of  her own, a guest will sometimes ask: \"Don't you want me to have the car  come back for us?\" The hostess can either say to an intimate friend \"Why,  yes, thank you very much,\" or to a more formal acquaintance, \"No, thank  you just the same--I have ordered taxis.\" Or she can accept. There is no  rule beyond her own feelings in the matter.    Mr. Doe takes his guests to the theater in taxis. The Normans, if only the  Lovejoys are dining with them, go in Mrs. Norman's little town car, but if  there are to be six or eight, the ladies go in her car and the gentlemen  follow in a taxi. (Unless Mrs. Worldly or Mrs. Gilding are in the party  and order their cars back.)      =TICKETS BOUGHT IN ADVANCE=    Before inviting anyone to go to a particular play, a hostess must be sure  that good tickets are to be had. She should also try to get seats for a  play that is new; since it is dull to take people to something they have  already seen. This is not difficult in cities where new plays come to town  every week, but in New York, where the same ones run for a year or more,  it is often a choice between an old good one or a new one that is poor."]]]
