In this plain of sage Venters flushed birds and rabbits, and when he had  proceeded about a mile he caught sight of the bobbing white tails of  a herd of running antelope. He rode along the edge of the stream which  wound toward the western end of the slowly looming mounds of stone.  The high slope retreated out of sight behind the nearer protection.  To Venters the valley appeared to have been filled in by a mountain of  melted stone that had hardened in strange shapes of rounded outline.  He followed the stream till he lost it in a deep cut. Therefore Venters  quit the dark slit which baffled further search in that direction, and  rode out along the curved edge of stone where it met the sage. It was  not long before he came to a low place, and here Wrangle readily climbed  up.    All about him was ridgy roll of wind-smoothed, rain-washed rock. Not a  tuft of grass or a bunch of sage colored the dull rust-yellow. He saw  where, to the right, this uneven flow of stone ended in a blunt wall.  Leftward, from the hollow that lay at his feet, mounted a gradual  slow-swelling slope to a great height topped by leaning, cracked,  and ruined crags. Not for some time did he grasp the wonder of that  acclivity. It was no less than a mountain-side, glistening in the sun  like polished granite, with cedar-trees springing as if by magic out of  the denuded surface. Winds had swept it clear of weathered shale, and  rains had washed it free of dust. Far up the curved slope its beautiful  lines broke to meet the vertical rim-wall, to lose its grace in a  different order and color of rock, a stained yellow cliff of cracks and  caves and seamed crags. And straight before Venters was a scene less  striking but more significant to his keen survey. For beyond a mile  of the bare, hummocky rock began the valley of sage, and the mouths of  canyons, one of which surely was another gateway into the pass.      He got off his horse, and, giving the bridle to Ring to hold, he  commenced a search for the cleft where the stream ran. He was not  successful and concluded the water dropped into an underground passage.  Then he returned to where he had left Wrangle, and led him down off the  stone to the sage. It was a short ride to the opening canyons. There was  no reason for a choice of which one to enter. The one he rode into was a  clear, sharp shaft in yellow stone a thousand feet deep, with wonderful  wind-worn caves low down and high above buttressed and turreted  ramparts. Farther on Venters came into a region where deep indentations  marked the line of canyon walls. These were huge, cove-like blind  pockets extending back to a sharp corner with a dense growth of  underbrush and trees.    Venters penetrated into one of these offshoots, and, as he had hoped, he  found abundant grass. He had to bend the oak saplings to get his horse  through. Deciding to make this a hiding-place if he could find water, he  worked back to the limit of the shelving walls. In a little cluster of  silver spruces he found a spring. This inclosed nook seemed an ideal  place to leave his horse and to camp at night, and from which to make  stealthy trips on foot. The thick grass hid his trail; the dense growth  of oaks in the opening would serve as a barrier to keep Wrangle in, if,  indeed, the luxuriant browse would not suffice for that. So Venters,  leaving Whitie with the horse, called Ring to his side, and, rifle in  hand, worked his way out to the open. A careful photographing in mind  of the formation of the bold outlines of rimrock assured him he would be  able to return to his retreat even in the dark.    Bunches of scattered sage covered the center of the canyon, and among  these Venters threaded his way with the step of an Indian. At intervals  he put his hand on the dog and stopped to listen. There was a drowsy  hum of insects, but no other sound disturbed the warm midday stillness.  Venters saw ahead a turn, more abrupt than any yet. Warily he rounded  this corner, once again to halt bewildered.    The canyon opened fan-shaped into a great oval of green and gray  growths. It was the hub of an oblong wheel, and from it, at regular  distances, like spokes, ran the outgoing canyons. Here a dull red color  predominated over the fading yellow. The corners of wall bluntly rose,  scarred and scrawled, to taper into towers and serrated peaks and  pinnacled domes.    Venters pushed on more heedfully than ever. Toward the center of this  circle the sage-brush grew smaller and farther apart He was about to  sheer off to the right, where thickets and jumbles of fallen rock would  afford him cover, when he ran right upon a broad cattle trail. Like a  road it was, more than a trail, and the cattle tracks were fresh. What  surprised him more, they were wet! He pondered over this feature. It  had not rained. The only solution to this puzzle was that the cattle had  been driven through water, and water deep enough to wet their legs.    Suddenly Ring growled low. Venters rose cautiously and looked over the  sage. A band of straggling horsemen were riding across the oval. He  sank down, startled and trembling. \"Rustlers!\" he muttered. Hurriedly  he glanced about for a place to hide. Near at hand there was  nothing but sage-brush. He dared not risk crossing the open  patches to reach the rocks. Again he peeped over the sage. The  rustlers--four--five--seven--eight in all, were approaching, but not  directly in line with him. That was relief for a cold deadness which  seemed to be creeping inward along his veins. He crouched down with  bated breath and held the bristling dog.    He heard the click of iron-shod hoofs on stone, the coarse laughter of  men, and then voices gradually dying away. Long moments passed. Then he  rose. The rustlers were riding into a canyon. Their horses were tired,  and they had several pack animals; evidently they had traveled far.  Venters doubted that they were the rustlers who had driven the red herd.  Olding's band had split. Venters watched these horsemen disappear under  a bold canyon wall.    The rustlers had come from the northwest side of the oval. Venters kept  a steady gaze in that direction, hoping, if there were more, to see  from what canyon they rode. A quarter of an hour went by. Reward for his  vigilance came when he descried three more mounted men, far over to the  north. But out of what canyon they had ridden it was too late to tell.  He watched the three ride across the oval and round the jutting red  corner where the others had gone.    \"Up that canyon!\" exclaimed Venters. \"Oldring's den! I've found it!\"    A knotty point for Venters was the fact that the cattle tracks all  pointed west. The broad trail came from the direction of the canyon  into which the rustlers had ridden, and undoubtedly the cattle had been  driven out of it across the oval. There were no tracks pointing the  other way. It had been in his mind that Oldring had driven the red herd  toward the rendezvous, and not from it. Where did that broad trail come  down into the pass, and where did it lead? Venters knew he wasted  time in pondering the question, but it held a fascination not easily  dispelled. For many years Oldring's mysterious entrance and exit to  Deception Pass had been all-absorbing topics to sage-riders.    All at once the dog put an end to Venters's pondering. Ring sniffed the  air, turned slowly in his tracks with a whine, and then growled. Venters  wheeled. Two horsemen were within a hundred yards, coming straight at  him. One, lagging behind the other, was Oldring's Masked Rider.    Venters cunningly sank, slowly trying to merge into sage-brush. But,  guarded as his action was, the first horse detected it. He stopped  short, snorted, and shot up his ears. The rustler bent forward, as if  keenly peering ahead. Then, with a swift sweep, he jerked a gun from its  sheath and fired.    The bullet zipped through the sage-brush. Flying bits of wood struck  Venters, and the hot, stinging pain seemed to lift him in one leap.  Like a flash the blue barrel of his rifle gleamed level and he shot  once--twice.    The foremost rustler dropped his weapon and toppled from his saddle, to  fall with his foot catching in a stirrup. The horse snorted wildly and  plunged away, dragging the rustler through the sage.    The Masked Rider huddled over his pommel slowly swaying to one side, and  then, with a faint, strange cry, slipped out of the saddle.        CHAPTER V. THE MASKED RIDER    Venters looked quickly from the fallen rustlers to the canyon where the  others had disappeared. He calculated on the time needed for running  horses to return to the open, if their riders heard shots. He waited  breathlessly. But the estimated time dragged by and no riders appeared.  Venters began presently to believe that the rifle reports had not  penetrated into the recesses of the canyon, and felt safe for the  immediate present.    He hurried to the spot where the first rustler had been dragged by his  horse. The man lay in deep grass, dead, jaw fallen, eyes protruding--a  sight that sickened Venters. The first man at whom he had ever aimed a  weapon he had shot through the heart. With the clammy sweat oozing  from every pore Venters dragged the rustler in among some boulders and  covered him with slabs of rock. Then he smoothed out the crushed trail  in grass and sage. The rustler's horse had stopped a quarter of a mile  off and was grazing.    When Venters rapidly strode toward the Masked Rider not even the cold  nausea that gripped him could wholly banish curiosity. For he had shot  Oldring's infamous lieutenant, whose face had never been seen. Venters  experienced a grim pride in the feat. What would Tull say to this  achievement of the outcast who rode too often to Deception Pass?    Venters's curious eagerness and expectation had not prepared him for the  shock he received when he stood over a slight, dark figure.

Failing to find a good harbour here, he stood out  for the south and definitely discovered and named Cape Cod, not far  from the modern city of Boston. From Cape Cod he made his way to the  Elizabeth Islands in Buzzard's Bay, and here he built a storehouse and  fort, and may be said to have laid the foundations of the future  colony of New England. He brought back with him a cargo of sassafras  root, which was then much esteemed as a valuable medicine and a remedy  for almost all diseases.    [Footnote 4: In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh, the half-brother of Sir  Humphrey Gilbert, financed an expedition to sail to the coast of North  America in a more southerly direction. In this way was founded the  (afterwards abandoned) colony of Roanoke, in North Carolina. It was to  this region that Queen Elizabeth applied the title of Virginia, which  some years afterwards was transferred to the first English colony on  the James River.]    Subsequent expeditions of English ships explored and mapped the coast  of Maine, and took on board Amerindians for exhibition in England.  Their adventures, together with those of the colonists farther south,  led to the creation of chartered companies, and to the great British  colonies of New England, New York, Virginia, the Carolinas, and  Georgia, which were to become in time the United States of America--a  vast field of adventure which we cannot follow farther in this book.    As regards Newfoundland, James I, in 1610, granted a patent to a  Bristol merchant for the foundation there of a colony, and although  this attempt, and another under Sir George Calvert (Lord Baltimore) in  1616, came almost to nothing through the attacks of the French and the  dislike of the crews of the fishing vessels to permanent settlers who  might interfere with the fishing industry, the English colonization of  Newfoundland to some extent caught hold, so that in 1650 there were  about two thousand colonists of English descent along the east and  south-east coasts of the island. But settlement was prohibited within  six miles of the shore, to please the fishermen, and this regulation  checked for more than two hundred years the colonization of  Newfoundland.    Nova Scotia as a British colony also came into being as another result  of these adventurous British expeditions to North America in the reign  of James I. Under the name of Acadie this region had been declared to  be a portion of New France by De Monts and Champlain in 1604-14. But  the English colonists in 1614 drove the French out of the peninsula of  Nova Scotia on the plea that it was a part of the discoveries made by  the Cabots on behalf of the British Crown. In 1621 James I gave a  grant of all this territory to Sir William Alexander under the name of  Nova Scotia, and both Charles I and Cromwell encouraged settlement in  this beautiful region. When Charles II ceded it to France in 1667 the  English and Scottish colonists who were residing there, and the  English settlers of New England, refused to recognize the effects of  the Treaty of Breda, and so harassed the French in the years which  followed that in 1713 Nova Scotia was, together with Newfoundland,  recognized as belonging to Great Britain. The French colonists were  allowed to remain, but during the course of the eighteenth century  they combined with the Amerindians (who liked the French and disliked  the British) and made the position of the British colonists so  precarious that they were finally expelled and obliged to transfer  themselves to Louisiana and Canada. This was the departure of the  Acadians so touchingly described by Longfellow.    The British had become tenacious of their rights over the east coast  of Newfoundland, because from the middle of the seventeenth century  onwards they were becoming increasingly interested in the whale  fisheries and the fur trade of the lands bordering on Hudson's Bay,  and would not tolerate any blocking of the sea route thither by the  French.    In the explorations of Arctic America, Frobisher's expeditions had  been succeeded by those of JOHN DAVIS, who in the course of three  voyages, beginning in June, 1585, passed the entrance of Hudson's  Straits and reached a point as far north as 72 deg. 41', a lofty granite  island, which he named Sanderson's Hope. He saw beyond him a great  sea, free, large, very salt, and blue, unobstructed by ice and of an  unsearchable depth, and believed that he had completely discovered the  eastern entrance of the North-West Passage.    [Illustration: ICEBERGS AND POLAR BEARS]    HENRY HUDSON, the great English navigator, who had made two voyages  (1607-8) for the English-Moscovy Company to discover a north-east  passage to India, past Siberia, commanded a third experiment in 1609  at the expense of the Dutch East India Company. He was to discover the  North-West Passage. For this purpose he entered the river now named  the Hudson, but soon found it was only a river; though he returned to  Holland with such an encouraging account of the surrounding country  that the Dutch a little later on, founded on the banks of the Hudson  River their colony of New Amsterdam (afterwards the State of New  York). In 1610 Hudson accepted a British commission to sail beyond  where Davis and Frobisher had passed, and once more seek for the  north-west passage to China. Instead he found the way into Hudson's  Bay. Here his men, alarmed at the idea of being lost in these regions  of ice and snow, mutinied against him, placed him and those who were  faithful to him in a boat, and cast them off, themselves returning to  England with the news of his discovery. Hudson was never heard of  again, and, strange to say, the mutineers apparently received no  punishment.    Between 1602 and 1668, English adventurers from London and Bristol,  notable amongst whom were WILLIAM BAFFIN, LUKE FOX, and CAPTAIN JAMES,  mapped the coasts of Hudson's Bay and Baffin's Bay and brought to the  notice of merchants in England the abundance of whales in these Arctic  waters, and of fur-bearing beasts and fur-trading Indians in the  region of Hudson's Bay.    This last point was most forcibly presented to Charles II and his  Government by a disappointed French Canadian, Pierre Esprit Radisson,  whose adventures will later on be described. Radisson, conceiving  himself to be badly treated by the French Governor of Canada, crossed  over to England with his brother-in-law, Chouart, and the two were  warmly taken up by Prince Rupert of Bavaria, the cousin of Charles II.  They were sent out by Prince Rupert in command of an expedition  financed by him and a number of London merchants, and in 1669 the New  England captain, Gillam, returned to England with Chouart and the  first cargo of furs from Hudson's Bay. This cargo so completely met  the expectations of those who had promoted the venture that it led in  1670 to the foundation of the Governor and Company of Adventurers of  England trading into Hudson's Bay, a company chartered by Charles II  and presided over by Prince Rupert, and an association which proved to  be the germ of British North America, of the vast three-quarters of  the present Dominion of Canada.          CHAPTER IV    Champlain and the Foundation of Canada      From the first voyage of Cartier onwards, Canada was called  intermittently New France, and its possibilities were not lost sight  of by a few intelligent Frenchmen on account of the fur trade. Amongst  these was Amyard de Chastes, at one time Governor of Dieppe, who got  into correspondence with the adventurers who had settled as fur  traders at Tadoussac, prominent amongst whom was Du Pont-Grave. De  Chastes dispatched with Pont-Grave a young man whose acquaintance he  had just made, SAMUEL CHAMPLAIN.[1] This was the man who, more than  any other, created French Canada.    [Footnote 1: Afterwards the Sieur de Champlain. The title of _Sieur_  (from the Latin _Senior_) is the origin of the English \"sir\", and is  about equivalent to an English baronetcy.]    Champlain had had already a most adventurous life. He was born about  1567, at Brouage, in the Saintonge, opposite to the Island of Heron,  on the coast of western France. From his earliest years he had a  passion for the sea, but he also served as a soldier for six years.  His father had been a sea captain, and his uncle as an experienced  navigator was commissioned by the King of Spain to transport by sea to  that country the remainder of the Spanish soldiers who had been  serving in Brittany. The uncle took his nephew with him. Young  Champlain when in Spain managed to ingratiate himself so much with the  Spanish authorities that he was actually commissioned as a captain to  take a king's ship out to the West Indies. No sooner did he reach  Spanish America than he availed himself of the first chance to  explore it. For two years he travelled over Cuba, and above all  Mexico. He visited the narrowest part of Central America and conceived  the possibility of making a trans-oceanic canal across the Panama  isthmus.    When he got back to France he placed before Henry IV a report on  Spanish Central America, together with a project for making a canal at  Panama. Henry IV was so pleased with his work and enterprise that he  gave him a pension and the title of Geographer to the King. Shortly  afterwards he met Governor de Chastes at Dieppe, and was by him sent  out to Canada. The ship which carried Champlain, PONT-GRAVE,[2] the  SIEUR DE MONTS,[3] and other French adventurers (together with two  Amerindian interpreters whom Pont-Grave had brought from Canada to  learn French) arrived at Tadoussac on May 24, 1603.
