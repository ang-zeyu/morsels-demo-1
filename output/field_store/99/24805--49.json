Hardly, however, had I turned  the wriggling little victim out upon the leather-covered table, when  down came the doctor's great thumb-nail upon him, and an inch-long smear  proved the tomb of all my hopes, while the great bibliographer, wiping  his thumb on his coat sleeve, passed on with the remark, \"Oh, yes! they  have black heads sometimes.\" That was something to know--another fact  for the entomologist; for my little gentleman had a hard, shiny, white  head, and I never heard of a black-headed bookworm before or since.  Perhaps the great abundance of black-letter books in the Bodleian may  account for the variety. At any rate he was an Anobium.    I have been unmercifully \"chaffed\" for the absurd idea that a  paper-eating worm could be kept a prisoner in a paper box. Oh, these  critics! Your bookworm is a shy, lazy beast, and takes a day or two to  recover his appetite after being \"evicted.\" Moreover, he knew his own  dignity better than to eat the \"loaded\" glazed shoddy note paper in  which he was incarcerated.    In the case of Caxton's \"Lyf of oure ladye,\" already referred to, not  only are there numerous small holes, but some very large channels at the  bottom of the pages. This is a most unusual occurrence, and is probably  the work of the larva of \"Dermestes vulpinus,\" a garden beetle, which is  very voracious, and eats any kind of dry ligneous rubbish.    The scarcity of edible books of the present century has been mentioned.  One result of the extensive adulteration of modern paper is that the  worm will not touch it. His instinct forbids him to eat the china clay,  the bleaches, the plaster of Paris, the sulphate of barytes, the scores  of adulterants now used to mix with the fibre, and, so far, the wise  pages of the old literature are, in the race against Time with the  modern rubbish, heavily handicapped. Thanks to the general interest  taken in old books now-a-days, the worm has hard times of it, and  but slight chance of that quiet neglect which is necessary to his,  existence. So much greater is the reason why some patient entomologist  should, while there is the chance, take upon himself to study the habits  of the creature, as Sir John Lubbock has those of the ant.    I have now before me some leaves of a book, which, being waste, were  used by our economical first printer, Caxton, to make boards, by pasting  them together. Whether the old paste was an attraction, or whatever the  reason may have been, the worm, when he got in there, did not, as usual,  eat straight through everything into the middle of the book, but worked  his way longitudinally, eating great furrows along the leaves without  passing out of the binding; and so furrowed are these few leaves by long  channels that it is difficult to raise one of them without its falling  to pieces.    This is bad enough, but we may be very thankful that in these temperate  climes we have no such enemies as are found in very hot countries, where  a whole library, books, bookshelves, table, chairs, and all, may be  destroyed in one night by a countless army of ants.    Our cousins in the United States, so fortunate in many things, seem very  fortunate in this--their books are not attacked by the \"worm\"--at any  rate, American writers say so. True it is that all their black-letter  comes from Europe, and, having cost many dollars, is well looked after;  but there they have thousands of seventeenth and eighteenth century  books, in Roman type, printed in the States on genuine and wholesome  paper, and the worm is not particular, at least in this country, about  the type he eats through, if the paper is good.    Probably, therefore, the custodians of their old libraries could tell  a different tale, which makes it all the more amusing to find in  the excellent \"Encyclopaedia of Printing,\"[1] edited and printed by  Ringwalt, at Philadelphia, not only that the bookworm is a stranger  there, for personally he is unknown to most of us, but that his  slightest ravages are looked upon as both curious and rare. After  quoting Dibdin, with the addition of a few flights of imagination of his  own, Ringwalt states that this \"paper-eating moth is supposed to have  been introduced into England in hogsleather binding from Holland.\" He  then ends with what, to anyone who has seen the ravages of the worm in  hundreds of books, must be charming in its native simplicity. \"There is  now,\" he states, evidently quoting it as a great curiosity, \"there is  now, in a private library in Philadelphia, a book perforated by this  insect.\" Oh! lucky Philadelphians! who can boast of possessing the  oldest library in the States, but must ask leave of a private collector  if they wish to see the one wormhole in the whole city!      [1] \"American Encyclopaedia of Printing\": by Luther Ringwalt. 8vo.  Philadelphia, 1871.        CHAPTER VII. OTHER VERMIN.    BESIDES the worm I do not think there is any insect enemy of books worth  description. The domestic black-beetle, or cockroach, is far too modern  an introduction to our country to have done much harm, though he will  sometimes nibble the binding of books, especially if they rest upon the  floor.    Not so fortunate, however, are our American cousins, for in the \"Library  Journal\" for September, 1879, Mr. Weston Flint gives an account of a  dreadful little pest which commits great havoc upon the cloth bindings  of the New York libraries. It is a small black-beetle or cockroach,  called by scientists \"Blatta germanica\" and by others the \"Croton  Bug.\" Unlike our household pest, whose home is the kitchen, and whose  bashfulness loves secrecy and the dark hours, this misgrown flat  species, of which it would take two to make a medium-sized English  specimen, has gained in impudence what it has lost in size, fearing  neither light nor noise, neither man nor beast. In the old English Bible  of 1551, we read in Psalm xci, 5, \"Thou shalt not nede to be afraied  for eny Bugges by night.\" This verse falls unheeded on the ear of the  Western librarian who fears his \"bugs\" both night and day, for they  crawl over everything in broad sunlight, infesting and infecting each  corner and cranny of the bookshelves they choose as their home. There  is a remedy in the powder known as insecticide, which, however, is very  disagreeable upon books and shelves. It is, nevertheless, very fatal to  these pests, and affords some consolation in the fact that so soon as  a \"bug\" shows any signs of illness, he is devoured at once by his  voracious brethren with the same relish as if he were made of fresh  paste.    There is, too, a small silvery insect (Lepisma) which I have often  seen in the backs of neglected books, but his ravages are not of much  importance.    Nor can we reckon the Codfish as very dangerous to literature,  unless, indeed, he be of the Roman obedience, like that wonderful  Ichthiobibliophage (pardon me, Professor Owen) who, in the year 1626,  swallowed three Puritanical treatises of John Frith, the Protestant  martyr. No wonder, after such a meal, he was soon caught, and became  famous in the annals of literature. The following is the title of a  little book issued upon the occasion: \"Vox Piscis, or the Book-Fish  containing Three Treatises, which were found in the belly of a Cod-Fish  in Cambridge Market on Midsummer Eve, AD 1626.\" Lowndes says (see  under \"Tracey,\") \"great was the consternation at Cambridge upon the  publication of this work.\"    Rats and mice, however, are occasionally very destructive, as the  following anecdote will show: Two centuries ago, the library of the Dean  and Chapter of Westminster was kept in the Chapter House, and repairs  having become necessary in that building, a scaffolding was erected  inside, the books being left on their shelves. One of the holes made in  the wall for a scaffold-pole was selected by a pair of rats for their  family residence. Here they formed a nest for their young ones by  descending to the library shelves and biting away the leaves of various  books. Snug and comfortable was the little household, until, one day,  the builder's men having finished, the poles were removed, and--alas!  for the rats--the hole was closed up with bricks and cement. Buried  alive, the father and mother, with five or six of their offspring, met  with a speedy death, and not until a few years ago, when a restoration  of the Chapter House was effected, was the rat grave opened again for a  scaffold pole, and all their skeletons and their nest discovered. Their  bones and paper fragments of the nest may now be seen in a glass case in  the Chapter House, some of the fragments being attributed to books from  the press of Caxton. This is not the case, although there are pieces of  very early black-letter books not now to be found in the Abbey library,  including little bits of the famous Queen Elizabeth's Prayer book, with  woodcuts, 1568.    A friend sends me the following incident: \"A few years since, some rats  made nests in the trees surrounding my house; from thence they jumped on  to some flat roofing, and so made their way down a chimney into a  room where I kept books. A number of these, with parchment backs, they  entirely destroyed, as well as some half-dozen books whole bound in  parchment.\"    Another friend informs me that in the Natural History Museum of the  Devon and Exeter Institution is a specimen of \"another little pest,  which has a great affection for bindings in calf and roan. Its  scientific name is Niptus Hololeucos.\" He adds, \"Are you aware that  there was a terrible creature allied to these, rejoicing in the name  of Tomicus Typographus, which committed sad ravages in Germany in  the seventeenth century, and in the old liturgies of that country is  formally mentioned under its vulgar name, 'The Turk'?\" (See Kirby and  Spence, Seventh Edition, 1858, p. 123.) This is curious, and I did not  know it, although I know well that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#9)"],[1,"dog most  heroically.           *       *       *       *       *    Then, after the purely trick-picture is disciplined till it has fewer  tricks, and those more human and yet more fanciful, the producer can move  on up into the higher realms of the fairy-tale, carrying with him this  riper workmanship.    Mabel Taliaferro's Cinderella, seen long ago, is the best film  fairy-tale the present writer remembers. It has more of the fireside  wonder-spirit and Hallowe'en-witch-spirit than the Cinderella of Mary  Pickford.    There is a Japanese actor, Sessue Hayakawa, who takes the leading part  with Blanche Sweet in The Clew, and is the hero in the film version of  The Typhoon. He looks like all the actors in the old Japanese prints. He  has a general dramatic equipment which enables him to force through the  stubborn screen such stagy plays as these, that are more worth while in  the speaking theatre. But he has that atmosphere of pictorial romance  which would make him a valuable man for the retelling of the old Japanese  legends of Kwannon and other tales that are rich, unused moving picture  material, tales such as have been hinted at in the gleaming English of  Lafcadio Hearn. The Japanese genius is eminently pictorial. Rightly  viewed, every Japanese screen or bit of lacquer is from the Ancient Asia  Columbus set sail to find.    It would be a noble thing if American experts in the Japanese principles  of decoration, of the school of Arthur W. Dow, should tell stories of old  Japan with the assistance of such men as Sessue Hayakawa. Such things go  further than peace treaties. Dooming a talent like that of Mr. Hayakawa  to the task of interpreting the Japanese spy does not conduce to accord  with Japan, however the technique may move us to admiration. Let such of  us as are at peace get together, and tell the tales of our happy  childhood to one another.    This chapter is ended. You will of course expect to be exhorted to visit  some photoplay emporium. But you need not look for fairy-tales. They are  much harder to find than they should be. But you can observe even in the  advertisements and cartoons the technical elements of the story of the  old lady and the pig. And you can note several other things that show how  much more quickly than on the stage the borderline of All Saints' Day and  Hallowe'en can be crossed. Note how easily memories are called up, and  appear in the midst of the room. In any plays whatever, you will find  these apparitions and recollections. The dullest hero is given glorious  visualizing power. Note the \"fadeaway\" at the beginning and the end of  the reel, whereby all things emerge from the twilight and sink back into  the twilight at last. These are some of the indestructible least common  denominators of folk stories old and new. When skilfully used, they can  all exercise a power over the audience, such as the crystal has over the  crystal-gazer.    But this discussion will be resumed, on another plane, in the tenth  chapter: \"Furniture, Trappings, and Inventions in Motion.\"          CHAPTER V    THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR      Henceforth the reader will use his discretion as to when he will read the  chapter and when he will go to the picture show to verify it.    The shoddiest silent drama may contain noble views of the sea. This part  is almost sure to be good. It is a fundamental resource.    A special development of this aptitude in the hands of an expert gives  the sea of humanity, not metaphorically but literally: the whirling of  dancers in ballrooms, handkerchief-waving masses of people in balconies,  hat-waving political ratification meetings, ragged glowering strikers,  and gossiping, dickering people in the marketplace. Only Griffith and his  close disciples can do these as well as almost any manager can reproduce  the ocean. Yet the sea of humanity is dramatically blood-brother to the  Pacific, Atlantic, or Mediterranean. It takes this new invention, the  kinetoscope, to bring us these panoramic drama-elements. By the law of  compensation, while the motion picture is shallow in showing private  passion, it is powerful in conveying the passions of masses of men.  Bernard Shaw, in a recent number of the Metropolitan, answered several  questions in regard to the photoplay. Here are two bits from his  discourse:--    \"Strike the dialogue from Moliere's Tartuffe, and what audience would  bear its mere stage-business? Imagine the scene in which Iago poisons  Othello's mind against Desdemona, conveyed in dumb show. What becomes of  the difference between Shakespeare and Sheridan Knowles in the film? Or  between Shakespeare's Lear and any one else's Lear? No, it seems to me  that all the interest lies in the new opening for the mass of dramatic  talent formerly disabled by incidental deficiencies of one sort or  another that do not matter in the picture-theatre....\"    \"Failures of the spoken drama may become the stars of the picture palace.  And there are the authors with imagination, visualization and first-rate  verbal gifts who can write novels and epics, but cannot for the life of  them write plays. Well, the film lends itself admirably to the  succession of events proper to narrative and epic, but physically  impracticable on the stage. Paradise Lost would make a far better film  than Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman, though Borkman is a dramatic  masterpiece, and Milton could not write an effective play.\"    Note in especial what Shaw says about narrative, epic, and Paradise Lost.  He has in mind, no doubt, the pouring hosts of demons and angels. This is  one kind of a Crowd Picture.    There is another sort to be seen where George Beban impersonates The  Italian in a film of that title, by Thomas H. Ince and G. Gardener  Sullivan. The first part, taken ostensibly in Venice, delineates the  festival spirit of the people on the bridges and in gondolas. It gives  out the atmosphere of town-crowd happiness. Then comes the vineyard, the  crowd sentiment of a merry grape-harvest, then the massed emotion of many  people embarking on an Atlantic liner telling good-by to their kindred on  the piers, then the drama of arrival in New York. The wonder of the  steerage people pouring down their proper gangway is contrasted with the  conventional at-home-ness of the first-class passengers above. Then we  behold the seething human cauldron of the East Side, then the jolly  little wedding-dance, then the life of the East Side, from the policeman  to the peanut-man, and including the bar tender, for the crowd is treated  on two separate occasions.    It is hot weather. The mobs of children follow the ice-wagon for chips of  ice. They besiege the fountain-end of the street-sprinkling wagon quite  closely, rejoicing to have their clothes soaked. They gather round the  fire-plug that is turned on for their benefit, and again become wet as  drowned rats.    Passing through these crowds are George Beban and Clara Williams as The  Italian and his sweetheart. They owe the force of their acting to the  fact that they express each mass of humanity in turn. Their child is  born. It does not flourish. It represents in an acuter way another phase  of the same child-struggle with the heat that the gamins indicate in  their pursuit of the water-cart.    Then a deeper matter. The hero represents in a fashion the adventures of  the whole Italian race coming to America: its natural southern gayety set  in contrast to the drab East Side. The gondolier becomes boot-black. The  grape-gathering peasant girl becomes the suffering slum mother. They are  not specialized characters like Pendennis or Becky Sharp in the Novels of  Thackeray.    Omitting the last episode, the entrance into the house of Corrigan, The  Italian is a strong piece of work.    Another kind of Crowd Picture is The Battle, an old Griffith Biograph,  first issued in 1911, before Griffith's name or that of any actor in  films was advertised. Blanche Sweet is the leading lady, and Charles H.  West the leading man. The psychology of a bevy of village lovers is  conveyed in a lively sweet-hearting dance. Then the boy and his comrades  go forth to war. The lines pass between hand-waving crowds of friends  from the entire neighborhood. These friends give the sense of patriotism  in mass. Then as the consequence of this feeling, as the special agents  to express it, the soldiers are in battle. By the fortunes of war the  onset is unexpectedly near to the house where once was the dance.    The boy is at first a coward. He enters the old familiar door. He appeals  to the girl to hide him, and for the time breaks her heart. He goes forth  a fugitive not only from battle, but from her terrible girlish anger.  But later he rallies. He brings a train of powder wagons through fires  built in his path by the enemy's scouts. He loses every one of his men,  and all but the last wagon, which he drives himself. His return with that  ammunition saves the hard-fought day.    And through all this, glimpses of the battle are given with a splendor  that only Griffith has attained.    Blanche Sweet stands as the representative of the bevy of girls in the  house of the dance, and the whole body social of the village. How the  costumes flash and the handkerchiefs wave around her! In the battle the  hero represents the cowardice that all the men are resisting within  themselves. When he returns, he is the incarnation of the hardihood they  have all hoped to display. Only the girl knows he was first a failure.  The wounded general honors him as the hero above all. Now she is radiant,  she cannot help but be triumphant, though the side of the house is blown  out by a shell and the dying are everywhere.    This one-reel work of art has been reissued of late by the Biograph  Company. It should be kept in the libraries of the Universities as a  standard. One-reel films are unfortunate in this sense that in order to  see a favorite the student must wait through"]]]
