[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14375"],[0,"The Adventures of Grandfather Frog (#9)"],[1,"he opened his eyes to look around. Then he blinked them  rapidly for a minute or so. He rubbed them to make sure that he saw  aright. His heart seemed to sink way, way down towards his toes.  \"Chugarum!\" exclaimed Grandfather Frog, \"Chugarum!\" And after that for a  long time he didn't say a word.    You see, it was this way. All around him rose perfectly straight smooth  walls. He could look up and see a little of the blue, blue sky right  overhead and whispering leaves of trees and bushes. Over the edge of the  smooth straight wall grasses were bending. But they were so far above  his head, so dreadfully far! _There wasn't any place to climb out!_  Grandfather Frog was in a prison! He didn't understand it at all, but it  was so.    Of course, Farmer Brown's boy could have told him all about it. A long  time before Farmer Brown himself had found that spring, and because the  water was so clear and cold and pure, he had cleared away all the dirt  and rubbish around it. Then he had knocked the bottom out of a nice  clean barrel and had dug down where the water bubbled up out of the sand  and had set the barrel down in this hole and had filled in the bottom  with clean white sand for the water to bubble up through. About half-way  up the barrel he had cut a little hole for the water to run out as fast  as it bubbled in at the bottom. Of course the water never could fill the  barrel, because when it reached that hole, it ran out. This left a  straight, smooth wall up above, a wall altogether too high for  Grandfather Frog to jump over from the inside.    Poor old Grandfather Frog! He wished more than ever that he never, never  had thought of leaving the Smiling Pool to see the Great World. Round  and round he swam, but he couldn't see any way out of it. The little  hole where the water ran out was too small for him to squeeze through,  as he found out by trying and trying. So far as he could see, he had  just got to stay there all the rest of his life. Worse still, he knew  that Farmer Brown's boy sometimes came to the spring for a drink, for he  had seen him do it. That meant that the very next time he came, he would  find Grandfather Frog, because there was no place to hide. When  Grandfather Frog thought of that, he just lost heart. Yes, Sir, he just  lost heart. He gave up all hope of ever seeing the Smiling Pool again,  and two big tears ran out of his big goggly eyes.          XXI    THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TRY TO COMFORT GRANDFATHER FROG      When the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had left  Grandfather Frog in the Long Lane where Farmer Brown's boy had dropped  him, and had hurried as fast as ever they could to try to find some of  his friends to help him, not one of them had been successful. No one was  at home, and no one was in any of the places where they usually were to  be found. The Merry Little Breezes looked and looked. Then, one by one,  they sadly turned back to the Long Lane. They felt so badly that they  just hated to go back where they had left Grandfather Frog.    When they got there, they found Striped Chipmunk, who now was scolding  Farmer Brown's boy as fast as his tongue could go.    \"Where is he?\" cried the Merry Little Breezes excitedly.    Striped Chipmunk stopped scolding long enough to point to Farmer Brown's  boy, who was hunting in the grass for some trace of Grandfather Frog.    \"We don't mean him, you stupid! We can see him for ourselves. Where's  Grandfather Frog?\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, all speaking at once.    \"I don't know,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, \"and what's more, I don't  care!\"    Now this wasn't true, for Striped Chipmunk isn't that kind. It was  mostly talk, and the Merry Little Breezes knew it. They knew that  Striped Chipmunk really thinks a great deal of Grandfather Frog, just as  they do. So they pretended not to notice what he said or how put out he  seemed. After a while, he told them that he had set Grandfather Frog  free and that then he had started for the spring on the other side of  the Long Lane. The Merry Little Breezes were delighted to hear the good  news, and they said such a lot of nice things to Striped Chipmunk that  he quite forgot to scold Farmer Brown's boy. Then they started for the  spring, dancing merrily, for they felt sure that there Grandfather Frog  was all right, and they expected to find him quite at home.    \"Hello, Grandfather Frog!\" they shouted, as they peeped into the spring.  \"How do you like your new home?\"    Grandfather Frog made no reply. He just rolled his great goggly eyes up  at them, and they were full of tears.    \"Why--why--why, Grandfather Frog, what is the matter now?\" they cried.    \"Chugarum,\" said Grandfather Frog, and his voice sounded all choky, \"I  can't get out.\"    Then they noticed for the first time how straight and smooth the walls  of the spring were and how far down Grandfather Frog was, and they knew  that he spoke the truth. They tried bending down the grasses that grew  around the edge of the spring, but none were long enough to reach the  water. If they had stopped to think, they would have known that  Grandfather Frog couldn't have climbed up by them, anyway. Then they  tried to lift a big stick into the spring, but it was too heavy for  them, and they couldn't move it. However, they did manage to blow an old  shingle in, and this gave Grandfather Frog something to sit on, so that  he began to feel a little better. Then they said all the comforting  things they could think of. They told him that no harm could come to  him there, unless Farmer Brown's boy should happen to see him.    [Illustration: \"That's just what I'm afraid of!\" croaked Grandfather  Frog. _Page 109_.]    \"That's just what I am afraid of!\" croaked Grandfather Frog. \"He is sure  to see me if he comes for a drink, for there is no place for me to  hide.\"    \"Perhaps he won't come,\" said one of the Little Breezes hopefully.    \"If he does come, you can hide under the piece of shingle, and then he  won't know you are here at all,\" said another.    Grandfather Frog brightened up. \"That's so!\" said he. \"That's a good  idea, and I'll try it.\"    Then one of the Merry Little Breezes promised to keep watch for Farmer  Brown's boy, and all the others started off on another hunt for some one  to help Grandfather Frog out of this new trouble.          XXII    GRANDFATHER FROG'S TROUBLES GROW      Head first in; no way out;    It's best to know what you're about!      Grandfather Frog had had plenty of time to realize how very true this  is. As he sat on the old shingle which the Merry Little Breezes had  blown into the spring where he was a prisoner, he thought a great deal  about that little word \"if.\" _If_ he hadn't left the Smiling Pool, _if_  he hadn't been stubborn and set in his ways, _if_ he hadn't been in such  a hurry, _if_ he had looked to see where he was leaping--well, any one  of these _ifs_ would have kept him out of his present trouble.    It really wasn't so bad in the spring. That is, it wouldn't have been  so bad but for the fear that Farmer Brown's boy might come for a drink  and find him there. That was Grandfather Frog's one great fear, and it  gave him bad dreams whenever he tried to take a nap. He grew cold all  over at the very thought of being caught again by Farmer Brown's boy,  and when at last one of the Merry Little Breezes hurried up to tell him  that Farmer Brown's boy actually was coming, poor old Grandfather Frog  was so frightened that the Merry Little Breeze had to tell him twice to  hide under the old shingle as it floated on the water.    At last he got it through his head, and drawing a very long breath, he  dived into the water and swam under the old shingle. He was just in  time. Yes, Sir, he was just in time. If Farmer Brown's boy hadn't been  thinking of something else, he certainly would have noticed the little  rings on the water made by Grandfather Frog when he dived in. But he was  thinking of something else, and it wasn't until he dipped a cup in for  the second time that he even saw the old shingle.    \"Hello!\" he exclaimed. \"That must have blown in since I was here  yesterday. We can't have anything like that in our nice spring.\"    With that he reached out for the old shingle, and Grandfather Frog,  hiding under it, gave himself up for lost. But the anxious Little Breeze  had been watching sharply and the instant he saw what Farmer Brown's boy  was going to do, he played the old, old trick of snatching his hat from  his head. The truth is, he couldn't think of anything else to do. Farmer  Brown's boy grabbed at his hat, and then, because he was in a hurry and  had other things to do, he started off without once thinking of the old  shingle again.    \"Chugarum!\" cried Grandfather Frog, as he swam out from under the  shingle and climbed up on it, \"That certainly was a close call. If I  have many more like it, I certainly shall die of fright.\"    Nothing more happened for a long time, and Grandfather Frog was  wondering if it wouldn't be safe to take a nap when he saw peeping over  the edge above him two eyes. They were greenish yellow eyes, and they  stared and stared. Grandfather Frog stared and stared back. He just  couldn't help it. He didn't know who they belonged to. He couldn't  remember ever having seen them before. He was afraid, and yet somehow he  couldn't make up his mind to jump. He stared so hard at the eyes that he  didn't notice a long furry paw slowly, very slowly, reaching down  towards him. Nearer it crept and nearer. Then suddenly it moved like a  flash. Grandfather Frog felt sharp claws in his white and yellow  waistcoat, and before he could even open his mouth to cry \"Chugarum,\" he  was sent flying through the air and landed on his back in the grass.  Pounce! Two paws pinned him down, and the greenish yellow eyes were not  an inch from his own. They belonged to Black Pussy, Farmer Brown's cat.          XXIII      THE DEAR OLD SMILING POOL ONCE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#9)"],[1,"world, it can be clearly  perceived that all is controlled by the \"Law of Affinity,\" the  attraction of the one for the other.  There, all is Infinite Love,  understood in its true sense.    It may now not be out of place to recapitulate what has already been  said.  The first thing to be done is to study the axioms of Occultism  and work upon them by the deductive and the inductive methods, which is  real contemplation.  To turn this to a useful purpose, what is  theoretically comprehended must be practically realized.    --Damodar K. Mavalaukar            Chelas and Lay Chelas      A \"chela\" is a person who has offered himself to a master as a pupil to  learn practically the \"hidden mysteries of Nature and the psychical  powers latent in man.\"  The master who accepts him is called in India a  Guru;  and the real Guru is always an adept in the Occult Science.  A  man of profound knowledge, exoteric and esoteric, especially the latter;  and one who has brought his carnal nature under the subjection of the  WILL;  who has developed in himself both the power (Siddhi) to control  the forces of Nature, and the capacity to probe her secrets by the help  of the formerly latent but now active powers of his being--this is the  real Guru.  To offer oneself as a candidate for Chelaship is easy  enough, to develop into an adept the most difficult task any man could  possibly undertake.  There are scores of \"natural-born\" poets,  mathematicians, mechanics, statesmen, &c.  But a natural-born adept is  something practically impossible.  For, though we do hear at very rare  intervals of one who has an extraordinary innate capacity for the  acquisition of occult knowledge and power, yet even he has to pass the  self-same tests and probations, and go through the self-same training as  any less endowed fellow aspirant.  In this matter it is most true that  there is no royal road by which favourites may travel.    For centuries the selection of Chelas--outside the hereditary group  within the gon-pa (temple)--has been made by the Himalayan Mahatmas  themselves from among the class--in Tibet, a considerable one as to  number--of natural mystics.  The only exceptions have been in the cases  of Western men like Fludd, Thomas Vaughan, Paracelsus, Pico di  Mirandolo, Count St. Germain, &c., whose temperament affinity to this  celestial science, more or less forced the distant Adepts to come into  personal relations with them, and enabled them to get such small (or  large) proportion of the whole truth as was possible under their social  surroundings.  From Book IV. of Kui-te, Chapter on \"The Laws of  Upasanas,\" we learn that the qualifications expected in a Chela were:--    1. Perfect physical health;    2. Absolute mental and physical purity;    3. Unselfishness of purpose;  universal charity;  pity for all  animate beings;    4. Truthfulness and unswerving faith in the law of Karma, independent of  the intervention of any power in Nature:  a law whose course is not to  be obstructed by any agency, not to be caused to deviate by prayer or  propitiatory exoteric ceremonies;    5. A courage undaunted in every emergency, even by peril to life;    6. An intuitional perception of one's being the vehicle of the  manifested Avalokiteswara or Divine Atma (Spirit);    7. Calm indifference for, but a just appreciation of, everything that  constitutes the objective and transitory world, in its relation with,  and to, the invisible regions.    Such, at the least, must have been the recommendations of one aspiring  to perfect Chelaship.  With the sole exception of the first, which in  rare and exceptional cases might have been modified, each one of these  points has been invariably insisted upon, and all must have been more or  less developed in the inner nature by the Chela's unhelped exertions,  before he could be actually \"put to the test.\"    When the self-evolving ascetic--whether in, or outside the active  world--has placed himself, according to his natural capacity, above,  hence made himself master of his (1) Sarira--body;  (2) Indriya--senses;  (3) Dosha--faults;  (4) Dukkha--pain;  and is ready to become one with  his Manas--mind;  Buddhi--intellection, or spiritual intelligence;  and  Atma--highest soul, i.e., spirit; when he is ready for this, and,  further, to recognize in Atma the highest ruler in the world of  perceptions, and in the will, the highest executive energy (power), then  may he, under the time-honoured rules, be taken in hand by one of the  Initiates.  He may then be shown the mysterious path at whose farther  end is obtained the unerring discernment of Phala, or the fruits of  causes produced, and given the means of reaching Apavarga--emancipation  from the misery of repeated births, pretya-bhava, in whose determination  the ignorant has no hand.    But since the advent of the Theosophical Society, one of whose arduous  tasks it is to re-awaken in the Aryan mind the dormant memory of the  existence of this science and of those transcendent human capabilities,  the rules of Chela selection have become slightly relaxed in one  respect.  Many members of the Society who would not have been otherwise  called to Chelaship became convinced by practical proof of the above  points, and rightly enough thinking that if other men had hitherto  reached the goal, they too, if inherently fitted, might reach it by  following the same path, importunately pressed to be taken as  candidates.  And as it would be an interference with Karma to deny them  the chance of at least beginning, they were given it.  The results have  been far from encouraging so far, and it is to show them the cause of  their failure as much as to warn others against rushing heedlessly upon  a similar fate, that the writing of the present article has been  ordered.  The candidates in question, though plainly warned against it  in advance, began wrong by selfishly looking to the future and losing  sight of the past.  They forgot that they had done nothing to deserve  the rare honour of selection, nothing which warranted their expecting  such a privilege;  that they could boast of none of the above enumerated  merits.  As men of the selfish, sensual world, whether married or  single, merchants, civilian or military employees, or members of the  learned professions, they had been to a school most calculated to  assimilate them to the animal nature, least so to develop their  spiritual potentialities.  Yet each and all had vanity enough to suppose  that their case would be made an exception to the law of countless  centuries, as though, indeed, in their person had been born to the world  a new Avatar!  All expected to have hidden things taught, extraordinary  powers given them, because--well, because they had joined the  Theosophical Society.  Some had sincerely resolved to amend their lives,  and give up their evil courses:  we must do them that justice, at all  events.    All were refused at first, Col. Olcott the President himself, to begin  with:  and he was not formally accepted as a Chela until he had proved  by more than a year's devoted labours and by a determination which  brooked no denial, that he might safely be tested.  Then from all sides  came complaints--from Hindus, who ought to have known better, as well as  from Europeans who, of course, were not in a condition to know anything  at all about the rules.  The cry was that unless at least a few  Theosophists were given the chance to try, the Society could not endure.  Every other noble and unselfish feature of our programme was ignored--a  man's duty to his neighbour, to his country, his duty to help,  enlighten, encourage and elevate those weaker and less favoured than he;  all were trampled out of sight in the insane rush for adeptship.  The  call for phenomena, phenomena, phenomena, resounded in every quarter,  and the Founders were impeded in their real work and teased  importunately to intercede with the Mahatmas, against whom the real  grievance lay, though their poor agents had to take all the buffets.  At  last, the word came from the higher authorities that a few of the most  urgent candidates should be taken at their word.  The result of the  experiment would perhaps show better than any amount of preaching what  Chelaship meant, and what are the consequences of selfishness and  temerity.  Each candidate was warned that be must wait for year in any  event, before his fitness could be established, and that he must pass  through a series of tests that would bring out all there was in him,  whether bad or good.  They were nearly all married men, and hence were  designated \"Lay Chelas\"--a term new in English, but having long had its  equivalent in Asiatic tongues.  A Lay Chela is but a man of the world  who affirms his desire to become wise in spiritual things.  Virtually,  every member of the Theosophical Society who subscribes to the second of  our three \"Declared Objects\" is such;  for though not of the number of  true Chelas, he has yet the possibility of becoming one, for he has  stepped across the boundary-line which separated him from the Mahatmas,  and has brought himself, as it were, under their notice.  In joining the  Society and binding himself to help along its work, he has pledged  himself to act in some degree in concert with those Mahatmas, at whose  behest the Society was organized, and under whose conditional protection  it remains. The joining is then, the introduction;  all the rest depends  entirely upon the member himself, and he need never expect the most  distant approach to the \"favour\" of one of our Mahatmas or any other  Mahatmas in the world--should the latter consent to become known--that  has not been fully earned by personal merit. The Mahatmas are the  servants, not the arbiters of the Law of Karma.    Lay-Chelaship confers no privilege upon any one except that of working  for merit under the observation of a Master.  And whether that Master be  or be not seen"]]]
