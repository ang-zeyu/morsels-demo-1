We must remember that he  may merely have been brought here after the crime.\"    \"Such a short period elapsed,\" replied the Inspector, \"between his  leaving the New Avenue Theater and the approximate time of his death  that it seems unlikely that he visited any intermediate spot.\"    \"But he may not have been in the crate when Bolton and I saw it.\"    \"I don't believe he was in the crate then,\" replied Gatton, \"but I  think he was at the Red House nevertheless.\"    I stared at him with curiosity.    \"You mean that he was in the house at the time that the constable and  I opened the garage?\"    \"I do. I think he was in that room where supper was laid for two.\"    \"Good God!\" I exclaimed; for there was something horrible in the idea  of the man who now lay murdered having been in the house presumably  alive, whilst Bolton and I had stood within forty yards of him; in the  idea that it had lain in our power, except for those human limitations  which rendered us ignorant of his presence, to have averted his fate,  perhaps to have checked the remorseless movement of this elaborate  murder machine which seemingly had been set up in the Red House.    \"Some one was here last night,\" declared Gatton suddenly, as we turned  to leave the deserted room, \"after you and Bolton had gone. Everything  incriminating the assassin has been removed. Looking at the matter  judicially, it becomes quite evident that any one clever enough to  have planned this crime could not possibly have been guilty of an act  of such glaring stupidity as that of accidentally leaving a photograph  planted upon the mantelpiece.\"    That this fact had presented itself to the Inspector with such a force  of conviction raised a great load from my mind. It had all along been  evident to me, but I had feared that to the official outlook of my  companion, and the official outlook is always peculiar, it might have  seemed otherwise.    \"The clever and cunning villain who planned this thing,\" I said, \"has  overstepped himself, as you say, Gatton. If the murder was planned  artistically, in his attempt to throw the onus of the crime upon  innocent shoulders he has been guilty of a piece of very mediocre  work. It would not deceive a child.\"    \"No, I agree with you there. The discovery of that photograph has done  more to convince me of the innocence of Miss Merlin than any amount of  testimonials to her good character could ever have done. You see,\" he  added, smiling whimsically, \"all sorts of people hitherto unsuspected  by their closest friends of criminal tendency, develop that taint, so  that I am never surprised to find a convicted thief or assassin  possessed of credentials which would do justice to an Archbishop. But  when I see an obviously artificial clew I recognize it a mile off.  Real clews never stare you in the face like that.\"    Coming out of the front door, we walked down the leaf-strewn drive to  find that the constable on duty at the gate had been joined by a  plain-clothes man who was evidently waiting to speak to the Inspector.    \"Yes?\" said Gatton eagerly, at sight of the newcomer.    \"We have her, sir,\" he reported tersely.    \"Does he refer to Marie?\" I asked.    Gatton nodded.    \"I think, Mr. Addison,\" he said, \"I will proceed immediately to Bow  Street, where she has been taken to be interrogated. Will you come  with me or are you otherwise engaged?\"    I hesitated ere I replied:    \"I do not particularly want to confront this woman, but I should be  much indebted if you could let me know the result of your  examination.\"    \"I shall do that without fail,\" said Gatton, \"and some time to-day I  should be obliged if you could provide me with the facts concerning  the little cat-images which you said you had in your possession.\"    \"Certainly,\" I agreed. \"You are still of the opinion that the mark  upon the crate and the image of the cat-woman have an important  bearing upon the crime?\"    \"I don't doubt it,\" was the reply. \"If the photograph clew is a false  one, the cat clew is a true one and one to be followed up. Perhaps,\"  he added, \"it would be as well if you returned now and looked out the  points which you think would be of interest, as when I come I may not  have long to stay.\"    \"I will do so,\" I said, \"although I think I can lay my hands upon the  material almost immediately.\"    Accordingly Gatton set off with the detective who had brought the news  of Marie's arrest and I, turning in the opposite direction, proceeded  towards my cottage in such a state of mental tumult respecting what  the end of all this would be and what it might mean for Isobel, that I  found myself unable to think connectedly; and needless to say I failed  to conjure up by any stretch of the imagination a theory which could  cover this amazing and terrible sequence of events.          CHAPTER VII    THE CAT OF BUBASTIS      \"She belongs to the innumerable family of cats which suddenly came  forth from the ruins of Tell Bastah in 1878,\" I wrote, Sir Gaston  Maspero's \"Egyptian Art\" lying before me on the table, \"and were in a  few years scattered over the whole world.\"    \"She is Bast, a goddess of good family, the worship of whom flourished  especially in the east of the delta, and she is very often drawn or  named on the monuments, although they do not tell us enough of her  myths or her origin. She was allied or related to the Sun, and was now  said to be his sister or wife, now his daughter. She sometimes filled  a gracious and beneficent role, protecting men against contagious  diseases or evil spirits, keeping them off by the music of her  sistrum: she had also her hours of treacherous perversity, during  which she played with her victim as with a mouse, before finishing him  off with a blow of her claws. She dwelt by preference in the city that  bore her name, Poubastit, the Bubastis of classical writers. Her  temple, at which Cheops and Chephren had worked while building their  pyramids, was rebuilt by the Pharaohs of the 22nd Dynasty, enlarged by  those of the 26th; when Herodotus visited it in the middle of the  fifth century B.C. he considered it one of the most remarkable he had  seen in the parts of Egypt through which he had traveled.    \"The fetes of Bast attracted pilgrims from all parts of Egypt, as at  the present day those of Sidi Ahmed el-Bedawee draw people to the  modern fair of Tantah. The people of each village crowded into large  boats to get there, men and women pell-mell, with the fixed intention  of enjoying themselves on the journey, a thing they never failed to  do. They accompanied the slow progress of navigation with endless  songs, love songs rather than sacred hymns, and there were also to be  found among them flute-players and castanet-players to support or keep  time to the voices. Whenever they passed by a town they approached the  bank as near as they could without landing, and then, while the  orchestra redoubled its noise, the passengers threw volleys of insults  and coarse remarks at the women standing on the banks; they retorted,  and when they had exhausted words ...\"    I finished my notes at this point; the improper behavior of the  Ancient Egyptians mentioned by the great Egyptologist having no  possible bearing upon the matter in hand, I thought. I then proceeded  to add some facts directly relating to the votive offerings laid at  the feet of the goddess.    \"The greater number of pilgrims, before returning home, left a  souvenir of their visit at the feet of Bast. It was a votive stele  with a fine inscription, and a picture showing the donor worshiping  his goddess; or a statuette in blue or green pottery, or if they were  wealthy, in bronze, silver, or sometimes gold: the goddess would be  standing, seated, crouching, with a woman's body and a cat's head, a  sistrum or an aegis in her hand. During the Greek period the figures  were in bronze or in painted or gilded wood surmounted by a cat's head  in bronze, many were life-size and modeled with elaborate art; they  had eyes of enamel and amulets on the forehead.\"    The learned authority went on to explain that these accumulated  offerings were after a time stored by the priests in cellars or in  pits dug expressly for them, \"veritable _favissae_ similar to those of  classical times.\" They accumulated in thousands, large and small, some  intact and fresh as when just made, others already out of shape and of  no value. The places of concealment were soon forgotten, and the  stores hidden therein reposed beyond the reach of men until the day  when the chances of excavation brought them to light.    My notes completed, I turned my attention to the little image of green  enamel ware which Gatton had left with me for examination. It was not  possible to determine the period at which it was buried, but judging  from the contours and general forms, together with the aspect of the  enamel, I thought I recognized the style of the second Saite Period,  and attributed the piece to the early Ptolemies, or the fourth century  B.C. It was the time when the worship of Bast and her subordinate  forms, Pakh, Mait, was most popular, the period when the most  extensive cemetery of cats was established in Egypt. The execution of  the little figure was pure Egyptian, and in no way betrayed Greek  influence.    So far had my studies proceeded when I heard the door-bell ring, and  Coates entered the room.    \"Detective-Inspector Gatton to see you, sir.\"    Gatton came in looking if anything more puzzled than when I had left  him at the Red House; also I thought he looked tired, and:    \"Mix yourself a drink, Inspector,\" I said, pointing to a side-table  upon which refreshments were placed.    \"Thanks,\" replied Gatton. \"I have not had time to stop for a drink or  even a smoke since I left you; but evidence is coming in quickly  enough now.\"    He helped himself to a whisky and soda, being an old visitor and one  used to the Bohemian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#9)"],[1,"\"Good Night, Ladies\" as they trooped  down the walk.    \"What a pleasure it is to have such dear, good friends,\" thought Grace as  she lay back on her couch after they had gone. \"They are well worth all  the loyalty I can give them.\"    She went to sleep that night unconscious of how soon her loyalty to one of  them would be put to the test.          CHAPTER VII    GATHERING CLOUDS      \"A sprained ankle is not so serious,\" declared Grace from her nest among  the sofa cushions. It was the Monday after the game. Her various  sympathetic classmates were seated about the Harlowe's comfortable living  room. A wood fire crackled cheerfully in the big, open fireplace, while a  large plate of chocolate fudge circulated from one lap to another.    \"Jessica, will you pour the chocolate?\" continued Grace to her friend, who  rose at once to comply with her request. \"Anne, will you help serve,  please?\"    Anne accordingly drew about the room a little table on wheels, containing  on its several shelves plates containing sandwiches, cookies and cakes.    \"Trust to the Harlowe's to have lots of good things to eat,\" exclaimed  Marian Barber. \"It must be fun to be laid up, Grace, if you can give a  party every afternoon.\"    \"I must entertain my friends when they are kind enough to come and see  me,\" answered Grace. \"But some people think sandwiches poor provender  unless they are the fancy kind, with olives and nuts in them. Miriam, for  instance would never serve such plain fare to her company as cream cheese  sandwiches.\"    \"Here comes Miriam up the walk now,\" cried Jessica. \"She looks as though  she had something on her mind.\"    Presently the door opened and Miriam was ushered in. Grace wondered a  little at her call, considering the unfriendly spirit Miriam had recently  exhibited toward her. She greeted Miriam cordially. The laws of  hospitality were sacred in the Harlowe family, and not for worlds would  Grace have shown anything but the kindest feeling toward a guest under her  own roof.    Miriam accepted the chair and the cup of chocolate tendered her, ignoring  the plate of cakes offered by Anne. She looked about her like a marksman  taking aim before he fires. There was a danger signal in either eye.    \"She is out for slaughter,\" thought Nora.    \"Well, Miriam, what's the news?\" said Marian Barber good-naturedly. \"You  have a mysterious, newsy look in your eye. Is it good, bad or  indifferent?\"    \"How did you guess that I had news?\" inquired Miriam. Then without waiting  for an answer she went on. \"I certainly have, and very unpleasant news, at  that.\"    \"Out with it,\" said Nora, \"and don't keep us in suspense.\"    \"Well,\" said Miriam, \"I suppose you all noticed how the juniors outwitted  us at every point last Saturday? We put up a hard fight, too. The reason  of it was that they knew every one of our signals.\"    \"How dreadful!\" \"How did they get their information?\" \"Who told you so?\"  were the exclamations that rose from the assembled girls.    Grace had raised herself to a sitting position and was steadily regarding  Miriam, who, well aware of that keen, searching gaze, deliberately  continued:    \"What makes the matter so much worse is the fact that we were betrayed by  a member of our own class.\"    \"Oh, Miriam, you don't mean that?\" said Jessica.    \"I am sorry to say that it is true,\" replied Miriam, \"and I am going to  put the matter before the class.\"    \"Tell us who it is, Miriam,\" cried the girls. \"We'll fix her!\"    \"Miriam,\" said Grace in a tone of quiet command that made every girl look  toward her, \"you are to mention no names while in my house.\"    Miriam's face flamed. Before she could reply, however, Grace went on.  \"Girls you must realize the position in which Miriam's remarks place me.  She is sure that she knows who betrayed our signals, and is willing to  name the person. Suppose she names some girl present. Think of the  feelings of that girl, my guest, yet not safe from accusation while here.  I should prove a poor sort of hostess if I allowed the honor of any of my  friends to suffer while in my house.    \"The place to discuss these things is in school. There every girl stands  on an equal footing and can refute any charges made against her. I wish to  say that I have a communication to make which may put a different face on  the whole matter. I know something of the story of those signals. When I  go back to school I shall call a meeting of the basketball team and its  subs. and tell them what I know about it; but not until then. Furthermore  it is not strictly a class matter, as it pertains to the basketball  players alone. Therefore any one outside the team has no right to  interfere. Please don't think me disagreeable. It is because I am trying  to avoid unpleasant consequences that I am firm about having no names  mentioned here.\"    [Illustration: \"You Need Mention No Names While in My House.\"]    There was an absolute silence in the room. The girls had a deep regard for  Grace on account of her frank, open nature and love of fair play; but  Miriam had her own particular friends who had respect for her on account  of her being a Nesbit. She had a faculty of obtaining her own way, too,  that seemed, to them, little short of marvellous, and she spent more money  than any other girl in Oakdale High School. It was therefore difficult to  choose between the two factions.    Nora broke the embarrassing pause.    \"Grace is right as usual,\" she said, \"and none of you girls should feel  offended. What's the use of wasting the whole afternoon quarrelling over  an old basketball game? Do talk about something pleasant. The sophomore  ball for instance. Do you girls realize that we ought to be making some  plans for it? It's the annual class dance, and should be welcomed, with  enthusiasm. We've all been so crazy over basketball that we've neglected  to think about our class responsibilities. We ought to try to make it a  greater success than any other dance ever given by a sophomore class. We  must call a meeting very soon, not to fight over basketball, but to make  arrangements for our dance.\"    Nora's reminder of the coming ball was a stroke of diplomacy on her part.    What school girl does not grow enthusiastic over a class dance? A buzz of  conversation immediately arose as to gowns, decorations, refreshments and  the thousand and one things all important to a festivity of that kind.    Miriam seeing that it was useless to try to raise any further disturbance,  cut her call short, taking with her several girls who were her staunch  upholders.    Those who remained did not seem sorry at her departure, and Grace drew a  breath of relief as the door closed upon the wilful girl. She had at least  saved Anne from a cruel attack, but how much longer she could do so was a  question. Miriam would undoubtedly bring up the subject at the first class  meeting, and Grace was not so sure, now, that the girls would be willing  to overlook the loss of the signals when she told them of it.    \"I shall be loyal to Anne, no matter what it costs me,\" she decided. \"She  has done nothing wrong, and Miriam will find that she cannot trample upon  either of us with impunity. As for Jessica and Nora, I know they will  agree with me.\"    Under cover of conversation, Grace whispered to Jessica that she wished  her to remain after the others had gone, and to ask Nora and Anne to do  the same.    When the last of the callers had said good-bye, and the four chums had the  room to themselves, Grace told Nora and Jessica about Anne's mishap, and  how utterly innocent of blame she was.    \"Do you mean to tell me that Miriam meant Anne when she said she could  name the girl?\" demanded Nora.    \"She did, indeed,\" replied Anne, \"and if it had not been for Grace she  would have made things very unpleasant for me.\"    \"Humph,\" ejaculated the fiery Nora, \"then all I have to say is that I  don't see how a nice boy like David ever happened to have a horrid  hateful, scheming sister like Miriam. Stand up for Anne? Well I rather  think so! Let Miriam dare to say anything like that to me.\"    \"Or me,\" said Jessica.    \"I knew you girls would feel the same as I do,\" said Grace. \"Anne has some  true friends, thank goodness. You see Miriam is basing all her  suppositions on the fact that Anne was allowed to come to practice. She  doesn't know anything about the loss of the signals. You remember she  objected to Anne seeing the practice game. Now she will try to show that  she was right in doing so.\"    \"Let her try it,\" said Jessica, \"She'll be sorry.\"    \"I am not so sure of that,\" said Anne quietly. \"You know that Miriam has  plenty of influence with certain girls, while I am only a stranger about  whom no one cares except yourselves and the boys and Mrs. Gray.    \"You are the brightest girl in school just the same,\" said Nora, \"and that  counts for a whole lot. Miss Thompson likes you, too, and our crowd is not  to be despised.\"    \"You are the dearest people in the world,\" responded Anne gratefully.  \"Please don't think that I am unappreciative. You have done far too much  for me, and I don't want you to get into trouble on my account. As long as  you girls care for me, I don't mind what the others think.\"    \"Don't say that Anne,\" said Jessica. \"You don't know how mean some of  those girls can be. Don't you remember the junior that was cut by her  class last year? Of course, she did something for which she deserved to be  cut, but the girls made her life miserable. The story went through every  class, and she got the cold shoulder all around. She's not here this year.  Her father sent her away to school, she was so unhappy. You remember her,  don't you?\" turning to Grace and Nora.    Both girls nodded. The story of the unfortunate junior loomed up before  them. Every girl in High School knew it.    \"We can only hope that history will not repeat itself,\" said Grace  thoughtfully. \"Of course, I don't mean that there is"]]]
