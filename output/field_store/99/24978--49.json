The author next considered the strains to which a ship is exposed, and  stated that he had before him the calculations for three of the  largest vessels, two of them of iron and the other of steel; and he  found, in the case of the iron, the maximum tension on the gunwale  during the greatest hogging strains likely to be endured at sea would  not exceed about six tons per square inch, while in the case of the  steel ship it is only about 61/2 tons. These strains are well within the  limits of safety, and a comparison of the scantlings of these with the  others justifies the assertion as to their general safety from a  structural point of view. The sections of these three ships are shown  in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, with their principal scantlings. It will be seen  from these sections that the three ships differ materially in their  mode of construction. In the case of Fig. 1, which represents the City  of Rome, the largest of the three, it will be seen that the main  framing of the vessel is entirely transverse, with very heavy keelsons  in the bottom, and large partial bulkheads or web frames, and the  outside plating arranged on what is termed the edge to edge principle,  with a great portion of it double. In the next section, Fig. 2, the  Servia, which is built of steel, on the other hand, the bottom is  built on the longitudinal cellular system, the first application, he  believed, of this system to an Atlantic liner. The plating of the  Servia is of the usual alternate outer and inner strake system, partly  double; while the third section, the Oregon, approaches more nearly to  the ordinary system of framing and plating usually adopted, but it  will be seen that she was well tied in the bottom by very heavy  intercostal and plate keelsons, as well as in the top by heavy  stringers and sheer strakes, with much of her plating doubled, and  heavy web frames inside. The author next considered the question of  stability, and went on to deal with the subject of twin screws, and  stated that the Barrow Shipbuilding Company has done more in the way  of planning and designing for the adoption of twin screws lately than  for any other mode of propulsion, and this chiefly for passenger  steamers. He did not attach much importance to the particular form of  the blade either in single or twin screws, as he believed so long as  the disk area, the surface, and pitch were properly adjusted to the  speed of the vessel, and to enable the engines to use, at the maximum  speed, just the full quantity of steam that the boilers can make, we  have got pretty nearly as far as we can get. To fix these dimensions  of the propeller accurately at the present time, and without further  knowledge of the action of the screw on the water, was, he thought,  impossible. All the rules and formulae are empirical. The best one he  knew is given in Table IV., due to Mr. Thom, the head of the Barrow  Company's engineering drawing office, and at present acting manager,  who has used it for some years in practice. These formulae are based  upon the assumption that the area of propeller disk should be  proportional to the indicated horse power, divided by the cube of the  speed, and the same with the projected area of the propeller and also  the surface.

He said that if  they were to have greater speed on the Atlantic, there was one point  which was not alluded to in the paper, and that was the total  abolition of cargo on board the great passenger steamers. If vessels  were built solely for passenger traffic, they would be able to insure  greater speed by reason of the greater slightness in build and the  additional space at the command of the designer. The existing Atlantic  express steamer was far too heavy, and might, if cargo was dispensed  with, be made with finer lines and more yacht-like. He looked on the  proposition to fit such vessels with longitudinal bulkheads with great  fear. If a collision took place--such, for example, as that which sunk  the Oregon--water would get access to one side only of the ship, and  it was not at all improbable that if a sea was on, she would turn  right over. At all events, very serious risk would be involved.    Mr. W.H. White, Chief Constructor to the Admiralty, said the question  of twin screw propulsion was one of special interest to himself, and  had been so for many years. In 1878 he dealt with it as fully as he  then could on the basis of the Admiralty data, and he then ventured to  say everything in favor of twin screws that Mr. John had said in his  paper. If greater power than that now used in such a ship as the  Etruria, for example, were demanded, two screws must be used. Good as  are the results obtained with the Etruria, it was by no means certain  that still better might not be had. If she had been fitted with two  screws instead of one, very great advantage would be gained by the  greater submergence of the twin screws, as thus racing would be almost  wholly prevented.    Mr. Calvert urged that more attention should be devoted to studying  the relative values of different portions of the propeller.    The sitting was then suspended. In the afternoon, as we have already  stated, the members visited the steamship Germanic on the invitation  of Messrs. Ismay, Imrie & Co., subsequently proceeding to Messrs. Cope  Brothers' tobacco works, and thence to the exhibition, where the  dinner of the Institution took place in the evening.    On Friday morning no paper was read; some official business was  transacted, and this being done, the discussion on Mr. John's paper  was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#9)"],[1,"conduct  and bearing of these troops in strange and new surroundings to have been  highly satisfactory, and I am enabled from my own observations to fully  corroborate this statement.\"    Sir John French goes on to say that, while the whole line continued to  be heavily pressed, the Germans' efforts from Nov. 1 have been  concentrated upon breaking through the line held by the First British  and the Ninth French Corps and thus gaining possession of the town of  Ypres. Three Bavarian and one German corps, in addition to other troops,  were all directed against this northern line.    About Nov. 10, after several units of these corps had been completely  shattered in futile attacks, the Field Marshal continues, a division of  the Prussian Guard, which had been operating in the vicinity of Arras,  was moved up to this area with great speed and secrecy. Documents found  on dead officers, the report says, proved that the Guard received the  German Emperor's special command to break through and succeed where  their comrades of the line had failed. They took the leading part in the  vigorous attacks made against the centre on the 11th and 12th, says  Field Marshal French, but, like their comrades, were repulsed with  enormous casualties.    He pays high tribute to Sir Douglas Haig and his divisional and brigade  commanders, who, he says, \"held the line with marvelous tenacity and  undaunted courage.\" The Field Marshal predicts that \"their deeds during  these days of stress and trial will furnish some of the most brilliant  chapters which will be found in the military history of our time.\"    High praise is also given the Third Cavalry Division under Major Gen.  Julian Byng, whose troops \"were repeatedly called upon to restore  situations at critical points and fill gaps in the line caused by the  tremendous losses which occurred.\"    The Commander in Chief makes special mention of Col. Gordon Chesney  Wilson of the Royal Horse Guards, Major the Hon. Hugh Dawnay of the  Second Life Guards, and Brig. Gen. FitzClarence of the Irish Guards, who  were killed, and of Brig. Gen. the Earl of Cavan, who \"on many occasions  was conspicuous for the skill, coolness, and courage with which he led  his troops.\"    Of the Flying Corps the report says:    \"Every day new methods of employing them, both strategically and  tactically, are discovered and put into practice.\"    Concerning the Territorials who have been employed, the Field Marshal  says the conduct and bearing of these units under fire and the efficient  manner in which they have carried out the duties assigned to them \"has  imbued me with the highest hope as to the value and the help of the  Territorial troops generally.\"    [Illustration]          *Story of the \"Eye-Witness\"*    *By Col.

Later it became known that they were the work of Col.       Swinton, who was attached to Gen. French's headquarters in the       capacity of \"official observer.\"_          I.    *The Battle of the Aisne Begins*    [By the \"Official Observer,\" Col. E.D. Swinton.]      General Headquarters,  Sept. 18, 1914.    Sept. 14, the Germans were making a determined resistance along the  River Aisne. Opposition, which it was at first thought might possibly be  of a rear-guard nature, not entailing material delay to our progress,  has developed and has proved to be more serious than was anticipated.    The action, now being fought by the Germans along their line, may, it is  true, have been undertaken in order to gain time for some strategic  operation or move, and may not be their main stand. But, if this is so,  the fighting is naturally on a scale which as to extent of ground  covered and duration of resistance, makes it undistinguishable in its  progress from what is known as a \"pitched battle,\" though the enemy  certainly showed signs of considerable disorganization during the  earlier days of their retirement phase.    Whether it was originally intended by them to defend the position they  took up as strenuously as they have done, or whether the delay, gained  for them during the 12th and 13th by their artillery, has enabled them  to develop their resistance and force their line to an extent not  originally contemplated cannot yet be said.    So far as we are concerned the action still being contested is the  battle of the Aisne. The foe we are fighting is just across the river  along the whole of our front to the east and west. The struggle is not  confined to the valley of that river, though it will probably bear its  name.    The progress of our operations and the French armies nearest us for the  14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th will now be described:    On Monday, the 14th, those of our troops which had on the previous day  crossed the Aisne, after driving in the German rear guards on that  evening, found portions of the enemy's forces in prepared defensive  positions on the right bank and could do little more than secure a  footing north of the river. This, however, they maintained in spite of  two counter-attacks delivered at dusk and 10 P.M., in which the fighting  was severe.    During the 14th, strong reinforcements of our troops were passed to the  north bank, the troops crossing by ferry, by pontoon bridges, and by the  remains of permanent bridges. Close co-operation with the French forces  was maintained and the general progress made was good, although the  opposition was vigorous and the state of the roads, after the heavy  rains, made movements slow. One division alone failed to secure the  ground it expected to.    The First Army Corps, after repulsing repeated attacks, captured 600  prisoners and twelve guns. The cavalry also took a number of prisoners.  Many of the Germans taken belong to the reserve and Landwehr formations,  which fact appears to indicate that the enemy is compelled to draw on  other classes of soldiers to fill the gaps in his ranks.    There was a heavy rain throughout the night of Sept. 14-15, and during  the 15th. The situation of the British forces underwent no essential  change. But it became more and more evident that the defensive  preparations made by the enemy were more extensive than was at first  apparent.    In order to counterbalance these measures were taken by us to economize  our troops and to secure protection from the hostile artillery fire,  which was very fierce, and our men continued to improve their own  intrenchments. The Germans bombarded our lines nearly all day, using  heavy guns, brought, no doubt, from before Maubeuge, as well as those  with the corps.    All their counter attacks, however, failed, although in some places they  were repeated six times. One made on the Fourth Guards Brigade was  repulsed with heavy slaughter.    An attempt to advance slightly, made by part of our line, was  unsuccessful as regards gain of ground, but led to the withdrawal of  part of the enemy's infantry and artillery.    Further counter attacks made during the night were beaten off. Rain came  on toward evening and continued intermittently until 9 A.M. on the 16th.  Besides adding to the discomfort of the soldiers holding the line, the  wet weather to some extent hampered the motor transport service, which  was also hindered by broken bridges.    On Wednesday, the 16th, there was little change in the situation  opposite the British. The efforts made by the enemy were less active  than on the previous day, although their bombardment continued  throughout the morning and evening. Our artillery fire drove the  defenders off one of the salients of their position, but they returned  in the evening. Forty prisoners were taken by the Third Division.    On Thursday, the 17th, the situation, still remained unchanged in its  essentials. The German heavy artillery fire was more active than on the  previous day. The only infantry attacks made by the enemy were on the  extreme right of our position, and, as had happened before, were  repulsed with heavy loss, chiefly, on this occasion, by our field  artillery.    In order to convey some idea of the nature of the fighting it may be  said that along the greater part of our front the Germans have been  driven back from the forward slopes on the north of the river. Their  infantry are holding strong lines of trenches among and along the edge  of the numerous woods which crown the slopes. These trenches are  elaborately constructed and cleverly concealed. In many places there are  wire entanglements and lengths of rabbit fencing.    Both woods and open are carefully aligned, so that they can be swept by  rifle fire and machine guns, which are invisible from our side of the  valley. The ground in front of the infantry trenches is also, as a rule,  under crossfire from the field artillery placed on neighboring features  and under high-angle fire from pieces placed well back behind the woods  on top of the plateau.    A feature of this action, as of the previous fighting, is the use by the  enemy of their numerous heavy howitzers, with which they are able to  direct long-range fire all over the valley and right across it. Upon  these they evidently place great reliance.    Where our men are holding the forked edges of the high ground on the  north side they are now strongly intrenched. They are well fed, and in  spite of the wet weather of the last week are cheerful and confident.    The bombardment by both sides has been very heavy, and on Sunday,  Monday and Tuesday was practically continuous. Nevertheless, in spite of  the general din caused by the reports of the immense number "]]]
