[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#9)"],[1," of  June. In Guernsey it is rather locally distributed, being common all  round the coast, both on the high and low part of the Island, but only  making its appearance in the cultivated part in the interior as an  occasional straggler. It is quite as common in Alderney and the other  Islands as it is in Guernsey, in Alderney there being few or no  enclosures, and no hedgerow timber. It is more universally distributed  over the whole Island, in the cultivated as well as the wild parts.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, but marks it as only occurring  in Guernsey and Sark. There are several specimens in the Museum, but I  did not see any eggs either there or in young Le Cheminant's collection.  This is probably because in Guernsey the Wheatear has a great partiality  for laying its eggs under large slabs and boulders of granite perfectly  immovable; the stones forming one of the Druids' altars in the Vale,  were made use of to cover a nest when I was there.      35. REED WARBLER. _Acrocephalus streperus_, Vieillot. French,  \"Rousserolle effarvatte,\" \"Bec-fin des roseaux.\"--I did not find out the  Reed Warbler as a Guernsey bird till this year (1878), though it is a  rather numerous but very local summer visitant. But Mr. MacCulloch put  me on the right track, as he wrote to me to say--\"The Reed Warbler  builds in the Grand Mare. I have seen several of their curious hanging  nests brought from there.\" This put me on the right scent, and I went  to the place as soon as I could, and found parts of it a regular  paradise for Reed Warblers, and there were a considerable number there,  who seemed to enjoy the place thoroughly, climbing to the tops of the  long reeds and singing, then flying up after some passing insect, or  dropping like a stone to the bottom of the reed-bed if disturbed or  frightened. On my first visit to the Grand Mare I had not time to search  the reed-beds for nests. But on going there a second time, on June 17,  with Colonel l'Estrange, we had a good search for nests, and soon found  one with four eggs in it which were quite fresh. This nest was about  three feet from the ground, tied on to four reeds,[9] and, as usual,  having no support at the bottom, was made entirely of long dry bents of  rather coarse grass, and a little of the fluff of the cotton plant woven  amongst the bents outside, but none inside. We did not find any other  nests in the Grand Mare, though we saw a great many more birds; the  reeds, however, were very thick and tall, high over our heads, so that  when we were a few feet apart we could not see each other, and the place  was full of pitfalls with deep water in them, which were very difficult  to be seen and avoided. Many of the nests, I suspect, were amongst the  reeds which were growing out of the water. Subsequently, on July the  12th, I found another Reed Warbler's nest amongst some reeds growing by  Mr. De Putron's pond near the Vale Church; this nest, which was attached  to reeds of the same kind as those at the Grand Mare, growing out of  water about a foot deep: it was about the same height above the water  that the other was from the ground; it had five eggs in it hard sat.  There were one or two pairs more breeding amongst these reeds, though I  could not very well get at the place without a boat, but the birds were  very noisy and vociferous whenever I got near their nests, as were the  pair whose nest I found. There were also a few pairs in some reed-beds  of the same sort near L'Eree.    These are all the places in which I have been able to find the Reed  Warbler in Guernsey. I have not found it myself in Alderney, but Mr.  Gallienne, in his remarks published with Professor Ansted's list,  says:--\"I have put the Reed Wren as doubtful for Guernsey, but I have  seen the nest of this bird found at Alderney.\" In the list itself it is  marked as belonging to Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark.    The Reed Warbler, though entirely insectivorous, is a very tame and  amusing cage-bird, and may easily be fed on raw meat chopped fine and a  little hard-boiled egg; but its favourite food is flies, and of these it  will eat any quantity, and woe even to the biggest bluebottle that may  buzz through its cage, for the active little bird will have it in a  moment, and after a few sharp snaps of the beak there is quite an end of  the bluebottle. Daddy long-legs, too, are favourite morsels, and after a  little beating about disappear down the bird's throat--legs, wings, and  all, without any difficulty. The indigestible parts are afterwards cast  up in pellets in the same manner as with Hawks.    I have never seen the nearly-allied and very similar Marsh Warbler,  _Acrocephalus palustris_, in Guernsey, but, as it may occasionally  occur, it may be as well perhaps to point out what little distinction  there is between the species. This seems to me to consist chiefly in the  difference of colour, the Reed Warbler, _Acrocephalus streperus_, at all  ages and in all states of plumage, being a warmer, redder brown than  _Acrocephalus palustris_, which is always more or less tinged with  green. The legs in _A. streperus_ are always darker than in _A.  palustris_; the beak also in _A. palustris_ seems rather broader at the  base and thicker. This bird also has a whitish streak over the eye,  which seems wanting in _A. streperus._ These distinctions seem to me  always to hold, good even in specimens which have been kept some time  and have faded to what has now generally got the name of \"Museum  colour.\"    Mr. Dresser, in his 'Birds of Europe,' points out another distinction  which no doubt is a good one in adult birds with their quills fully  grown, but fails in young birds and in adults soon after the moult,  before the quills are fully grown, and also before the moult if any  quills have been shed and not replaced. This distinction is that in _A.  streperus_ the second (that is the first long quill, for the first in  both species is merely rudimentary) is shorter than the fourth, and in  _A. palustris_ it is longer.    Though I think it not at all improbable that the Marsh Warbler,  _Acrocephalus palustris_, may occur in Guernsey, I should not expect to  find it so much in the wet reed-beds in the Grand Mare and at the Vale  pond as amongst the lilac bushes and ornamental shrubs in the gardens,  or in thick bramble bushes in hedgerows and places of that sort.      36. SEDGE WARBLER. _Acrocephalus schoenobaenus_, Linnaeus. French,  \"Bee-fin phragmite.\"--The Sedge Warbler is by no means so common as the  Reed Warbler, though, like it, it is a summer visitant, and is quite as  local. I did not see any amongst the reeds which the Reed Warbler  delighted in, but I saw a few amongst some thick willow hedges with  thick grass and rushes growing by the side of the bank, and a small  running stream in each ditch. Though perfectly certain the birds were  breeding near, we could not find the nests. So well were they hidden  amongst the thick grass and herbage by the side of the stream that  Colonel l'Estrange and myself were quite beaten in our search for the  nest, though we saw the birds several times quite near enough to be  certain of their identity. I did not shoot one for the purpose of  identification, as perhaps I ought to have done, but I thought if I shot  one it would be extremely doubtful whether I should ever find it amongst  the thick tangle--certainly unless quite dead there would not have been  a chance. I felt quite certain, however, that all I saw were Sedge  Warblers; had I felt any doubt as to the possibility of one of them  turning out to be the Aquatic Warbler, _Acrocephalus aquaticus_, I  should certainly have tried the effect of a shot. As it is quite  possible, however, that the Aquatic Warbler may occasionally, or perhaps  regularly, in small numbers, visit the Channel Islands, as they are  quite within its geographical range, I may point out, for the benefit of  any one into whose hands it may fall, that it may easily be  distinguished from the Sedge Warbler by the pale streak passing through  the centre of the dark crown of the head.    The Sedge Warbler is not mentioned by Professor Ansted in his list, and  there is no specimen of either this or the Reed Warbler in the Museum.      37. DARTFORD WARBLER. _Melizophilus undatus,_ Boddaert. French, \"Pitchou  Provencal,\" \"Bee-fin Pittechou.\"--The Dartford Warbler is by no means  common in the Channel Islands--indeed I have never seen one there  myself, but Miss C.B. Carey records one in the 'Zoologist' for 1874 as  having been knocked down with a stone in the April of that year and  brought into Couch's shop, where she saw it. I have no doubt of the  correctness of this identification, as Miss Carey knew the bird well. I  see no reason why it should not be more common in Guernsey than is  usually supposed, as there are many places well suited to it, but its  rather dull plumage, and its habit of hiding itself in thick  furze-bushes, and creeping from one to another as soon as disturbed,  contribute to keep it much out of sight, unless one knows and can  imitate its call-note, in which case the male bird will soon answer and  flutter up to the topmost twig of the furze-bush in which it may have  previously been concealed, fluttering its wings, and repeating the call  until again disturbed. This is the only occurrence of which I am aware  in any of the Islands, included in the limits I have prescribed for  myself; but Mr. Harvie Brown has recorded two seen by him near Greve de  Lecq, in Jersey, in January. See 'Zoologist' for 1869, p. 1561.    It is not included in Professor Ansted's list, and there is no specimen  in the Museum.      38. WHITETHROAT. _Sylvia rufa_, Boddaert. French, \"Fauvette grise,\"  \"Bec-fin Grisette.\"--The Whitethroat has hitherto perhaps been better  known by the name used in the former edition of 'Yarrell' and by Messrs.  Degland and Gerbe, _Curruca cinerea_, but in consequence of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#9)"],[1,"jar, empty of all but air: if I examine it  with a taper, I shall find that it contains nothing but air. I will now  take this jar full of the gas that I am speaking of, and deal with it as  though it were a light body. I will hold both upside-down, and turn the  one up under the other; and that which did contain the gas procured from  the steam, what does it contain now? You will find it now only contains  air. But look! Here is the combustible substance [taking the other jar]  which I have poured out of the one jar into the other. It still preserves  its quality, and condition, and independence, and therefore is the more  worthy of our consideration, as belonging to the products of a candle.    Now, this substance which we have just prepared by the action of iron on  the steam or water, we can also get by means of those other things which  you have already seen act so well upon the water. If I take a piece of  potassium, and make the necessary arrangements, it will produce this gas;  and if, instead, a piece of zinc, I find, when I come to examine it very  carefully, that the main reason why this zinc cannot act upon the water  continuously as the other metal does, is because the result of the action  of the water envelopes the zinc in a kind of protecting coat. We have  learned in consequence, that if we put into our vessel only the zinc and  water, they by themselves do not give rise to much action, and we get no  result. But suppose I proceed to dissolve off this varnish--this  encumbering substance--which I can do by a little acid; the moment I do  this, I find the zinc acting upon the water exactly as the iron did, but  at the common temperature. The acid in no way is altered, except in its  combination with the oxide of zinc, which is produced. I have now poured  the acid into the glass, and the effect is as though I were applying heat  to cause this boiling up. There is something coming off from the zinc very  abundantly, which is not steam. There is a jar full of it; and you will  find that I have exactly the same combustible substance remaining in the  vessel, when I hold it upside-down, that I produced during the experiment  with the iron barrel. This is what we get from water--the same substance  which is contained in the candle.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    Let us now trace distinctly the connection between these two points. This  is hydrogen--a body classed among those things which in Chemistry we call  elements, because we can get nothing else out of them. A candle is not an  elementary body, because we can get carbon out of it; we can get this  hydrogen out of it, or at least out of the water which it supplies. And  this gas has been so named hydrogen, because it is that element which, in  association with another, generates water. [Footnote: [greek: hudos],  \"water,\" and [greek: gennao], \"I generate.\"] Mr. Anderson having now been  able to get two or three jars of gas, we shall have a few experiments to  make, and I want to shew you the best way of making these experiments. I  am not afraid to shew you, for I wish you to make experiments, if you will  only make them with care and attention, and the assent of those around  you. As we advance in Chemistry, we are obliged to deal with substances  which are rather injurious, if in their wrong places--the acids, and heat,  and combustible things we use, might do harm if carelessly employed. If  you want to make hydrogen, you can make it easily from bits of zinc, and  sulphuric or muriatic acid. Here is what in former times was called the  \"philosopher's candle.\" It is a little phial with a cork, and a tube or  pipe passing through it.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    And I am now putting a few little pieces of zinc into it. This little  instrument I am going to apply to a useful purpose in our  demonstrations--for I want to shew you that you can prepare hydrogen, and  make some experiments with it as you please at your own homes. Let me here  tell you why I am so careful to fill this phial nearly, and yet not quite  full. I do it because the evolved gas, which, as you have seen, is very  combustible, is explosive to a considerable extent when mixed with air,  and might lead to harm, if you were to apply a light to the end of that  pipe before all the air had been swept out of the space above the water. I  am now about to pour in the sulphuric acid. I have used very little zinc,  and more sulphuric acid and water, because I want to keep it at work for  some time. I therefore take care in this way to modify the proportions of  the ingredients, so that I may have a regular supply--not too quick, and  not too slow. Supposing I now take a glass and put it upside-down over the  end of the tube, because the hydrogen is light I expect that it will  remain in that vessel a little while. We will now test the contents of our  glass to see if there be hydrogen in it. I think I am safe in saying we  have caught some [applying a light]. There it is, you see. I will now  apply a light to the top of the tube. There is the hydrogen burning. There  is our philosophical candle. It is a foolish feeble sort of a flame, you  may say; but it is so hot that scarcely any common flame gives out so much  heat. It goes on burning regularly, and I am now about to put that flame  to burn under a certain arrangement, in order that we may examine its  results and make use of the information which we may thereby acquire.  Inasmuch as the candle produces water, and this gas comes out of the  water, let us see what this gives us by the same process of combustion  that the candle went through when it burnt in the atmosphere; and for that  purpose I am going to put the lamp under this apparatus, in order to  condense whatever may arise from the combustion within it In the course of  a short time you will see moisture appearing in the cylinder, and you will  get the water running down the side; and the water from this hydrogen  flame will have absolutely the same effect upon all our tests, being  obtained by the same general process as in the former case. This hydrogen  is a very beautiful substance. It is so light that it carries things up:  it is far lighter than the atmosphere; and I dare say I can shew you this  by an experiment which, if you are very clever, some of you may even have  skill enough to repeat. Here is our generator of hydrogen, and here are  some soap-suds. I have an india-rubber tube connected with the hydrogen  generator, and at the end of the tube is a tobacco-pipe.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    I can thus put the pipe into the suds, and blow bubbles by means of the  hydrogen. You observe how the bubbles fall downwards when I blow them with  my warm breath; but notice the difference when I blow them with hydrogen.  [The Lecturer here blew bubbles with hydrogen, which rose to the roof of  the theatre.] It shews you how light this gas must be in order to carry  with it not merely the ordinary soap-bubble, but the larger portion of a  drop hanging to the bottom of it. I can shew its lightness in a better way  than this; larger bubbles than these may be so lifted up; indeed, in  former times balloons used to be filled with this gas. Mr. Anderson will  fasten this tube on to our generator, and we shall have a stream of  hydrogen here with which we can charge this balloon made of collodion. I  need not even be very careful to get all the air out, for I know the power  of this gas to carry it up. [Two collodion balloons were inflated, and  sent up, one being held by a string.] Here is another larger one made of  thin membrane, which we will fill and allow to ascend. You will see they  will all remain floating about until the gas escapes.    What, then, are the comparative weights of these substances? I have a  table here which will shew you the proportion which their weights bear to  each other. I have taken a pint and a cubic foot as the measures, and have  placed opposite to them the respective figures. A pint measure of this  hydrogen weighs three-quarters of our smallest weight (a grain), and a  cubic foot weighs one-twelfth of an ounce; whereas a pint of water weighs  8,750 grains, and a cubic foot of water weighs almost 1,000 ounces. You  see, therefore, what a vast difference there is between the weight of a  cubic foot of water and a cubic foot of hydrogen.    Hydrogen gives rise to no substance that can become solid, either during  combustion or afterwards as a product of its combustion. But when it  burns, it produces water only; and if we take a cold glass and put it over  the flame, it becomes damp, and you have water, produced immediately in  appreciable quantity; and nothing is produced by its combustion but the  same water which you have seen the flame of the candle produce. It is  important to remember that this hydrogen is the only thing in nature which  furnishes water as the sole product of combustion.    And now we must endeavour to find some additional proof of the general  character and composition of water; and for this purpose I will keep you a  little longer, so that at our next meeting we may be better prepared for  the subject. We have the power of arranging the zinc which you have seen  acting upon the water by the assistance of an acid, in such a manner as to  cause all the power to be evolved in the place where we require it I have  behind me a voltaic pile, and I am just about to shew you, at the end of  this lecture, its character and power, that you may see what we shall have  to deal with when next we meet. I hold here the extremities of the wires  which transport the power from behind me, and which I shall cause to act  on the water.    We have previously seen what a power of combustion is possessed by the  potassium, or the zinc, or the iron-filings; but none of them shew such  energy as this.
