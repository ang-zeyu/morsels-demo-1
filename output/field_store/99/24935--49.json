THE STORY ABOUT ALCOHOL.    Several hundred years ago many people were trying to discover something  that would keep them young and strong, and prevent them from dying. It is  said by some that a man named Paracelsus, in making experiments, discovered  _alcohol_. He called it \"the water of life,\" and boasted that he would  never be weak and never die; so he went on drinking alcoholic liquors until  at last he died in a drunken fit.    What is this alcohol which has done and is doing so much mischief in the  world? I will show you some. What does it look like?--\"Water.\" Yes; and if  you were to smell it you would say it has a somewhat pleasant odor; if you  were to taste it, that it has a hot, biting taste, _i.e._, is pungent. If  you put a lighted match to it you would notice that it burns easily, and  with a flame, and may therefore be said to be combustible and inflammable.    What does it come from? Is it one of the drinks God has given us? Some of  the class think it is; we will try to learn whether this answer is correct  or not. If we study about it very carefully we shall discover that it is  not a natural drink, that it is not found except where it has been made  from decayed or rotten fruits, grains, or vegetables.    If you take some apples, and squeeze the juice out of them, you will find  it sweet and pleasant; let that juice stand for several days and what will  happen to it?--\"It will get bad.\" Yes; or, as grown people say, it will  _work_ or _ferment_; that is, the sugary part of the juice will be  separated into a kind of gas and a liquid. The gas is called _carbonic acid  gas_; the liquid is _alcohol_. Both the gas and the liquid are poisonous.    Alcohol may also be obtained from other fruits, as grapes, and from some  grains and vegetables. But all these must first become rotten before  alcohol will come out of them. This is one reason why we think that God,  who gives us good, wholesome food, did not intend alcohol to be a drink for  man, else He would have put it into the delicious ripe fruit, and not made  it impossible to get until they decay.    Now let us put upon the blackboard something which will help us remember  what we have learned about                              ALCOHOL.  DISCOVERED BY         DESCRIPTION.          MADE FROM  Paracelsus.           Water-like; with a    Fruits, Grains, or                        pleasant odor; a      Vegetables.  CALLED                hot, biting taste;  \"The water of life.\"  and will burn with a                        flame.           *       *       *       *       *    USES OF ALCOHOL.    We put some sugar into water; the children see that it melts; then some  glue or shellac is placed in the same liquid; they see that this is not  melted, but that, when alcohol is used instead of water, the glue or  shellac is dissolved. From this experiment they learn that alcohol is used  in making varnishes.    Some water is poured into one saucer, and alcohol into another; a lighted  match is applied to each; the class notices that the alcohol takes fire and  burns, while the water does not.    Next, we fill a lamp with alcohol, and put a wick into it; when the wick  becomes wet with the fluid it burns steadily and without smoke, as may be  seen by holding a clean white saucer over the flame. This shows why  jewellers and others, who wish to use a lamp to make things very hot,  prefer alcohol to kerosene, which, as the children know, smokes  lamp-chimneys, or anything else, so easily.    We show a thermometer; the children are told its use if they are not  already familiar with the instrument; we talk about the quicksilver in the  tube, about its rising or falling according to the degree of heat or cold;  then we inform the class that in some countries where it is very cold  quicksilver freezes; for this reason alcohol, which does not freeze, is  colored red and put into the thermometer tube to be used in these Arctic  regions.    Another use for alcohol is to keep or preserve substances. This we  illustrate by placing a piece of meat into some alcohol. We explain that  the water in the meat is that which causes it to decay. Alcohol has the  power to take up or _absorb_ water; so when meat is put into this liquid  the water from the meat is absorbed by it, and the meat does not become  bad. Those who wish to preserve insects a long time, and doctors who desire  to keep any portion of a human body after death, put these into alcohol, in  which they may be kept for a long time.    Lastly, we let the children smell cologne or other perfumery, and tell them  this is made from different oils mixed with alcohol.    At the close of this lesson the class is ready to help us make the  following BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.    FACTS ABOUT ALCOHOL.            GOOD USES OF ALCOHOL.  It melts gums.

In making jewelry.           *       *       *       *       *    USES OF ALCOHOL--_concluded_.    You see alcohol is very useful for some purposes; but do people ever drink  it? Some of the children think not, and we grant that no one is foolish  enough to drink _raw_ alcohol, because it is too strong. It would take only  a little to make them drunk, and only a few ounces to kill them instantly.    We ask the pupils if they have ever seen a drunken person, and what made  that person drunk? We soon obtain an answer, and place upon the board \"Rum,  gin, whiskey, brandy,\" as the names of drinks which will take away the good  sense of those who drink them. To these are added \"Wine, beer, ale, lager,  and cider.\"    We explain that all these have alcohol in them, as may be known by smelling  them, or by smelling the breath of those who have drunk even a little of  them; and that because they contain alcohol they are called _alcoholic  liquors_. If a person drinks any one of them he will be poisoned, more or  less, according to how much he takes. The children are astonished at the  word _poisoned_, but we explain that the very word, _intoxicated_, means  poisoned. So a drunken man is a poisoned man. If enough alcohol, or  alcoholic liquor, is drunk by anyone, he will drop down dead as quickly as  if he were shot by a cannon ball.    When told that alcohol is not a food, but a poison, the class readily  understands what we mean, and we have no difficulty in having the following  statements prepared and memorized:           *       *       *       *       *    FOOD.    That which makes the body grow, and helps to keep it alive.    POISON.    That which hurts the body, and makes it die.    ALCOHOL.    QUALITIES.                      GOOD USES.

By fermentation we mean the  change which takes place when a juice containing sugar decays, or goes to  pieces. You know decay always makes things fall to pieces.    You ask, what pieces is sugar made of? Very, very little pieces, called  _atoms_. There are different kinds of sugar. In that made from grapes,  called _grape sugar_, there are six atoms of carbon, twelve of hydrogen,  and six of oxygen. What are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen? Oxygen is the  kind of gas which keeps animals alive, and makes things burn. Hydrogen is  another kind, which you have smelled perhaps when water has been spilled on  a hot stove; the gas burned in street-lamps is hydrogen that has been  driven out of coal.

It takes me a little while after I return, to get  the vocal apparatus in shape again.    \"Thus it means constant study, eternal vigilance to attain the goal,  then to hold what you have attained and advance beyond it if possible.\"          VII    =LUISA TETRAZZINI=    THE COLORATURA VOICE      Luisa Tetrazzini has been called the greatest exponent of coloratura  singing that we have at the present time. Her phenomenal successes in  various quarters of the globe, where she has been heard in both opera  and concert, are well known, and form pages of musical history, full of  interest. This remarkable voice, of exquisite quality and development,  is another proof that we have as beautiful voices to-day, if we will but  realize the fact, as were ever known or heard of in the days of famous  Italian songsters.    [Illustration: LOUISA TETRAZZINI]    Portraits often belie the artist, by accentuating, unduly, some  individuality of face or figure, and Tetrazzini is no exception. From  her pictures one would expect to find one of the imperious, dominating  order of prima donnas of the old school. When I met the diva, I was at  once struck by the simplicity of her appearance and attire. There was  nothing pompous about her; she did not carry herself with the air of  one conscious of possessing something admired and sought after by all  the world, something which set her on a high pedestal apart from other  singers. Not at all. I saw a little lady of plump, comfortable figure, a  face which beamed with kindliness and good humor, a mouth wreathed with  smiles. Her manner and speech were equally simple and cordial, so that  the visitor was put at ease at once, and felt she had known the great  singer for years.    Before the conference could begin a pretty episode happened, which  showed the human side of the singer's character, and gave a glimpse into  her every day life. Mme. Tetrazzini was a little late for her  appointment, as she had been out on a shopping expedition, an occupation  which she greatly enjoys. Awaiting her return was a group of  photographers, who had arranged their apparatus, mirrors and flash-light  screen, even to the piano stool on which the singer was to be placed.  She took in the situation at a glance, as she entered, and obediently  gave herself into the hands of the picture makers.    \"Ah, you wish to make me beautiful,\" she exclaimed, with her pretty  accent; \"I am not beautiful, but you may try to make me look so.\" With  patience she assumed the required poses, put her head on this side or  that, drew her furs closer about her or allowed them to fall away from  the white throat, with its single string of pearls. The onlooker  suggested she be snapped with a little black \"Pom,\" who had found his  way into the room and was now an interested spectator, on his vantage  ground, a big sofa. So little \"Joy\" was gathered up and held in  affectionate, motherly arms, close against his mistress' face. It was  all very human and natural, and gave another side to the singer's  character from the side she shows to the public.    At last the ordeal was over, and Madame was free to leave her post and  sit in one of the arm chairs, where she could be a little more  comfortable. The secretary was also near, to be appealed to when she  could not make herself intelligible in English. \"My English is very  bad,\" she protested; \"I have not the time now to learn it properly; that  is why I speak it so very bad. In the summer, or next year, I will  really learn it. Now, what is it I can tell you? I am ready.\"      FOR THE DEBUTANTE    To ask such a natural born singer how she studies and works, is like  asking the fish swimming about in the ocean, to tell you where is the  sea! She could not tell you how she does it. Singing is as the breath of  life to Tetrazzini--as natural as the air she breathes. Realizing this,  I began at the other end.    \"What message have you, Madame, for the young singer, who desires to  make a career?\"    \"Ah, yes, the debutante. Tell her she must practice much--very much--\"  and Madame spread out her hands to indicate it was a large subject; \"she  must practice several hours every day. I had to practice very much when  I began my study--when I was sixteen; but now I do not have to spend  much time on scales and exercises; they pretty well go of themselves\";  and she smiled sweetly.    \"You say,\" she continued, \"the debutante--the young singer--does not  know--in America--how much she needs the foreign languages. But she  should learn them. She should study French, Italian and Spanish, and  know how to speak them. Because, if she should travel to those  countries, she must make herself understood, and she must be able to  sing in those languages, too.    \"Besides the languages, it is very good for her to study piano also;  she need not know it so well as if she would be a pianist, but she  should know it a little; yet it is better to know more of the piano--it  will make her a better musician.\"      THE COLORATURA VOICE    \"You love the coloratura music, do you not, Madame?\"    \"Ah, yes, I love the coloratura,--it suits me; I have always studied for  that--I know all the old Italian operas. For the coloratura music you  must make the voice sound high and sweet--like a bird--singing and  soaring. You think my voice sounds something like Patti's? Maybe. She  said so herself. Ah, Patti was my dear friend--my very dear friend--I  loved her dearly. She only sang the coloratura music, though she loved  Wagner and dramatic music. Not long before she died she said to me:  'Luisa, always keep to the coloratura music, and the beautiful _bel  canto_ singing; do nothing to strain your voice; preserve its velvety  quality.' Patti's voice went to C sharp, in later years; mine has  several tones higher. In the great aria in Lucia, she used to substitute  a trill at the end instead of the top notes; but she said to  me--'Luisa, _you_ can sing the high notes!'\"    \"Then the breathing, Madame, what would you say of that?\"    \"Ah, the breathing, that is very important indeed. You must breathe from  here, you know--what you call it--from the diaphragm, and from both  sides; it is like a bellows, going in and out,\" and she touched the  portions referred to. \"One does not sing from the chest,--that would  make queer, harsh tones.\" She sang a few tones just to show how harsh  they would be.    \"You have shown such wonderful breath control in the way you sustain  high tones, beginning them softly, swelling then diminishing them.\"    \"Ah, yes, the coloratura voice must always be able to do those things,\"  was the answer.    \"Should you ever care to become a dramatic singer?\" she was asked.    Tetrazzini grew thoughtful; \"No, I do not think so,\" she said, after a  pause; \"I love my coloratura music, and I think my audience likes it  too; it goes to the heart--it is all melody, and that is what people  like. I sing lyric music also--I am fond of that.\"    \"Yes, and you sing songs in English, with such good diction, that we  can all understand you--almost every word.\"    Madame beamed.    \"I promise you I will learn English better next year; for I shall come  back to my friends in America next autumn. I shall be in Italy in the  summer. I have two homes over there, one in Italy and one in  Switzerland.    \"Do I prefer to sing in opera or concert, you ask? I believe I like  concert much better, for many reasons. I get nearer to the audience; I  am freer--much freer, and can be myself and not some other person. There  is no change of costume, either; I wear one gown, so it is easier; yes,  I like it much more.    \"In traveling over your big country--you see I have just been out to  California and back--I find your people have advanced so very much in  appreciation of music; you know so much more than when I was here  before; that was indeed a long time ago--about twelve years,--\" and  Madame made a pretty little gesture.    \"But in one way your great big country has scarcely advanced any if at  all; you have not advanced in providing opera for your music lovers. You  need permanent opera companies in all the larger cities. The opera  companies of New York and Chicago are fine, oh yes,--but they cannot  give opera to the whole country. There are a few traveling companies  too, which are good. But what are they in your big country? You should  have opera stock companies all over, which would give opera for the  people. Then your fine American girls would have the chance to gain  operatic experience in their own country, which they cannot get now.  That is why the foreign singer has such a chance here, and that is why  the native singer can hardly get a chance. All the American girls' eyes  turn with longing to the Metropolitan Opera House; and with the best  intentions in the world the Director can only engage a small number of  those he would like to have, because he has no room for them. He can not  help it. So I say, that while your people have grown so much in the  liking and in the understanding of music, you do not grow on this side,  because your young singers are obliged to travel to a foreign land to  get the practice in opera they are unable to get at home. You need to do  more for the permanent establishing of opera in the large and small  cities of your country.\"    Madame did not express her thoughts quite as consecutively as I have set  them down, but I am sure she will approve, as these are her ideas of  the musical situation in this country.    As I listened to the words of this \"second Patti,\" as she is called, and  learned of her kindly deeds, I was as much impressed by her kindness of  heart as I had been by her beautiful art of song. She does much to  relieve poverty and suffering wherever she finds it. As a result of her  \"vocal mastery,\" she has been able to found a hospital in Italy for  victims of tuberculosis,"]]]
