Archias, who wrote in honour of Cicero's consulship, lived in the house of  the two Catuli[225].    We have seen that when Cicero found it too late to withdraw the first  edition of the _Academica_ from circulation, he affixed a prooemium to each  book, Catulus being lauded in the first, Lucullus in the second. From the  passages above quoted, and from our knowledge of Cicero's habit in such  matters, we can have no difficulty in conjecturing at least a portion of  the contents of the lost prooemium to the _Catulus_. The achievements of  the elder Catulus were probably extolled, as well as those of his son. The  philosophical knowledge of the elder man was made to cast its lustre on the  younger. Cicero's glorious consulship was once more lauded, and great  stress was laid upon the patronage it received from so famous a man as the  younger Catulus, whose praises were sung in the fervid language which  Cicero lavishes on the same theme elsewhere. Some allusion most likely was  made to the connection of Archias with the Catuli, and to the poem he had  written in Cicero's honour. Then the occasion of the dialogue, its supposed  date, and the place where it was held, were indicated. The place was the  Cuman villa of Catulus[226]. The feigned date must fall between the year 60  B.C. in which Catulus died, and 63, the year of Cicero's consulship, which  is alluded to in the _Lucullus_[227]. It is well known that in the  arrangement of his dialogues Cicero took every precaution against  anachronisms.    The prooemium ended, the dialogue commenced. Allusion was undoubtedly made  to the _Hortensius_, in which the same speakers had been engaged; and after  more compliments had been bandied about, most of which would fall to  Cicero's share, a proposal was made to discuss the great difference between  the dogmatic and sceptic schools. Catulus offered to give his father's  views, at the same time commending his father's knowledge of philosophy.  Before we proceed to construct in outline the speech of Catulus from  indications offered by the _Lucullus_, it is necessary to speak of the  character and philosophical opinions of Catulus the elder.    In the many passages where Cicero speaks of him, he seldom omits to mention  his _sapientia_, which implies a certain knowledge of philosophy. He was,  says Cicero, the kindest, the most upright, the wisest, the holiest of  men[228]. He was a man of universal merit, of surpassing worth, a second  Laelius[229]. It is easy to gather from the _De Oratore_, in which he  appears as an interlocutor, a more detailed view of his accomplishments.  Throughout the second and third books he is treated as the lettered man,  par excellence, of the company[230]. Appeal is made to him when any  question is started which touches on Greek literature and philosophy. We  are especially told that even with Greeks his acquaintance with Greek, and  his style of speaking it, won admiration[231]. He defends the Greeks from  the attacks of Crassus[232]. He contemptuously contrasts the Latin  historians with the Greek[233]. He depreciates the later Greek rhetorical  teaching, while he bestows high commendation on the early sophists[234].  The systematic rhetoric of Aristotle and Theophrastus is most to his  mind[235]. An account is given by him of the history of Greek speculation  in Italy[236]. The undefiled purity of his Latin style made him seem to  many the only speaker of the language[237]. He had written a history of his  own deeds, in the style of Xenophon, which Cicero had imitated[238], and  was well known as a wit and writer of epigrams[239].    Although so much is said of his general culture, it is only from the  _Academica_ that we learn definitely his philosophical opinions. In the _De  Oratore_, when he speaks of the visit of Carneades to Rome[240], he does  not declare himself a follower of that philosopher, nor does Crassus, in  his long speech about Greek philosophy, connect Catulus with any particular  teacher. The only Greek especially mentioned as a friend of his, is the  poet Antipater of Sidon[241]. Still it might have been concluded that he  was an adherent either of the Academic or Peripatetic Schools. Cicero  repeatedly asserts that from no other schools can the orator spring, and  the whole tone of the _De Oratore_ shows that Catulus could have had no  leaning towards the Stoics or Epicureans[242]. The probability is that he  had never placed himself under the instruction of Greek teachers for any  length of time, but had rather gained his information from books and  especially from the writings of Clitomachus. If he had ever been in actual  communication with any of the prominent Academics, Cicero would not have  failed to tell us, as he does in the case of Antonius[243], and  Crassus[244]. It is scarcely possible that any direct intercourse between  Philo and Catulus can have taken place, although one passage in the  _Lucullus_ seems to imply it[245]. Still Philo had a brilliant reputation  during the later years of Catulus, and no one at all conversant with Greek  literature or society could fail to be well acquainted with his  opinions[246]. No follower of Carneades and Clitomachus, such as Catulus  undoubtedly was[247], could view with indifference the latest development  of Academic doctrine. The famous books of Philo were probably not known to  Catulus[248].    I now proceed to draw out from the references in the _Lucullus_ the chief  features of the speech of Catulus the younger. It was probably introduced  by a mention of Philo's books[249]. Some considerable portion of the speech  must have been directed against the innovations made by Philo upon the  genuine Carneadean doctrine. These the elder Catulus had repudiated with  great warmth, even charging Philo with wilful misrepresentation of the  older Academics[250]. The most important part of the speech, however, must  have consisted of a defence of Carneades and Arcesilas against the dogmatic  schools[251]. Catulus evidently concerned himself more with the system of  the later than with that of the earlier sceptic. It is also exceedingly  probable that he touched only very lightly on the negative Academic  arguments, while he developed fully that positive teaching about the  [Greek: pithanon] which was so distinctive of Carneades. All the counter  arguments of Lucullus which concern the destructive side of Academic  teaching appear to be distinctly aimed at Cicero, who must have represented  it in the discourse of the day before[252]. On the other hand, those parts  of Lucullus' speech which deal with the constructive part of  Academicism[253] seem to be intended for Catulus, to whom the maintenance  of the genuine Carneadean distinction between [Greek: adela] and [Greek:  akatalepta] would be a peculiarly congenial task. Thus the commendation  bestowed by Lucullus on the way in which the _probabile_ had been handled  appertains to Catulus. The exposition of the sceptical criticism would  naturally be reserved for the most brilliant and incisive orator of the  party--Cicero himself. These conjectures have the advantage of establishing  an intimate connection between the prooemium, the speech of Catulus, and  the succeeding one of Hortensius. In the prooemium the innovations of Philo  were mentioned; Catulus then showed that the only object aimed at by them,  a satisfactory basis for [Greek: episteme], was already attained by the  Carneadean theory of the [Greek: pithanon]; whereupon Hortensius showed,  after the principles of Antiochus, that such a basis was provided by the  older philosophy, which both Carneades and Philo had wrongly abandoned.  Thus Philo becomes the central point or pivot of the discussion. With this  arrangement none of the indications in the _Lucullus_ clash. Even the  demand made by Hortensius upon Catulus[254] need only imply such a bare  statement on the part of the latter of the negative Arcesilaean doctrines  as would clear the ground for the Carneadean [Greek: pithanon]. One  important opinion maintained by Catulus after Carneades, that the wise man  would opine[255] ([Greek: ton sophon doxasein]), seems another indication  of the generally constructive character of his exposition. Everything  points to the conclusion that this part of the dialogue was mainly drawn by  Cicero from the writings of Clitomachus.    Catulus was followed by Hortensius, who in some way spoke in favour of  Antiochean opinions, but to what extent is uncertain[256]. I think it  extremely probable that he gave a resume of the history of philosophy,  corresponding to the speech of Varro in the beginning of the _Academica  Posteriora_. One main reason in favour of this view is the difficulty of  understanding to whom, if not to Hortensius, the substance of the speech  could have been assigned in the first edition. In the _Academica  Posteriora_ it was necessary to make Varro speak first and not second as  Hortensius did; this accounts for the disappearance in the second edition  of the polemical argument of Hortensius[257], which would be appropriate  only in the mouth of one who was answering a speech already made. On the  view I have taken, there would be little difficulty in the fact that  Hortensius now advocates a dogmatic philosophy, though in the lost dialogue  which bore his name he had argued against philosophy altogether[258], and  denied that philosophy and wisdom were at all the same thing[259]. Such a  historical resume as I have supposed Hortensius to give would be within the  reach of any cultivated man of the time, and would only be put forward to  show that the New Academic revolt against the supposed old  Academico-Peripatetic school was unjustifiable. There is actual warrant for  stating that his exposition of Antiochus was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],[0,"Mob Rule in New Orleans (#9)"],[1," the Negro threw up both hands. Constable Dannenhauer and    Patrolman Keegan took charge of him and hustled him off to jail, where    he was locked up. The Negro does not at all resemble Robert Charles, but    it was best for his sake that he was placed under lock and key. The    crowd was not in a humor to let any Negro pass muster last night. The    prisoner gave his name as Luke Wallace.      But now came the real excitement. The train had slowed down almost to a    standstill, in the very heart of town. Somebody shouted: \"There he goes,    on top of the train!\" And sure enough, somebody was going. It was a    Negro, too, and he was making a bee-line for the front end of the train.    A veritable shower of bullets, shot and rifle balls greeted the flying    form, but on it sped. The locomotive had stopped in the middle of the    square between La voisier and Newton Streets, and the Negro, flying with    the speed of the wind along the top of the cars, reached the first car    of the train and jumped to the tender and then into the cab. As he did    several white men standing at the locomotive made a rush into the cab.    The Negro sprang swiftly out of the other side, on to the sidewalk. But    there were several more men, and as he realized that he was rushing    right into their arms he made a spring to leap over the fence of Mrs.    Linden's home, on the wood side of the track. Before the Negro got to    the top one white man had hold of his legs, while another rushed up,    pistol in hand. The man who was holding the darkey's legs was jostled    out of the way and the man with the pistol, standing directly beneath    the Negro, sent two bullets at him.      There was a wild scramble, and the vision of a fleeing form in the    Linden yard, but that was the last seen of the black man. The yard was    entered and searched, and neighboring yards were also searched, but not    even the trace of blood was found. It is almost impossible to believe    that the Negro was not wounded, for the man who fired at him held the    pistol almost against the Negro's body.      The shots brought out almost everybody--white--in town, and though there    was nothing to show for the exciting work, except the arrest of the    Negro, who doesn't answer the description of the man wanted, Gretna's    male population had its little fan and felt amply repaid for all the    trouble it was put to, and all the ammunition it wasted.      +BRUTALITY IN NEW ORLEANS+    Mob rule reigned supreme Wednesday, and the scenes that were enacted  challenge belief. How many colored men and women were abused and injured  is not known, for those who escaped were glad to make a place of refuge  and took no time to publish their troubles. The mob made no attempt to  find Charles; its only purpose was to pursue, beat and kill any colored  man or woman who happened to come in sight. Speaking editorially, the  _Picayune_ of Thursday, the twenty-sixth of July, said:      +ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES+    At the Charity Hospital Wednesday night more than a score of people were  treated for wounds received at the hands of the mob. Some were able to  tell of their mistreatment, and their recitals are briefly given in the  _Picayune_ as follows:      Alex. Ruffin, who is quite seriously injured, is a Pullman car porter, a    native of Chicago. He reached New Orleans at 9:20 o'clock last night,    and after finishing his work, boarded a Henry Clay Avenue car to go to    Delachaise Street, where he has a sick son.      \"I hadn't ridden any way,\" said he, \"when I saw a lot of white folks.    They were shouting to 'Get the Niggers.' I didn't know they were after    every colored man they saw, and sat still. Two or three men jumped on    the car and started at me. One of them hit me over the head with a    slungshot, and they started to shooting at me. I jumped out of the car    and ran, although I had done nothing. They shot me in the arm and in the    leg. I would certainly have been killed had not some gentleman taken my    part. If I had known New Orleans was so excited I would never have left    my car.\"      George Morris is the name of a Negro who was badly injured by a mob    which went through the Poydras Market. Morris is employed as watchman    there. He heard the noise of the passing crowd and looked out to see    what the matter was. As soon as the mob saw him its members started    after him.      \"One man hit me over the head with a club,\" said George, after his    wounds had been dressed, \"and somebody cut me in the back. I didn't    hardly think what was the matter at first, but when I saw they were    after me I ran for my life. I ran to the coffee stand, where I work, for    protection, but they were right after me, and somebody shot me in the    back. At last the police got me away from the crowd. Just before I was    hit a friend of mine, who was in the crowd, said, 'You had better go    home, Nigger; they're after your kind.' I didn't know then what he    meant. I found out pretty quick.\"      Morris is at the hospital. He is a perfect wreck, and while he will    probably get well, he will have had a close call.      Esther Fields is a Negro washerwoman who lives at South Claiborne and    Toledano Streets. She was at home when she heard a big noise and went    out to investigate. She ran into the arms of the mob, and was beaten    into insensibility in less time than it takes to tell it. Esther is    being treated at the charity hospital, and should be able to get about    in a few days. The majority of her bruises are about the head.      T.P. Sanders fell at the hands of the Jackson Avenue mob. He lives at    1927 Jackson Avenue, and was sitting in front of his home when he saw    the crowd marching out the street. He stayed to see what the excitement    was all about, and was shot in the knee and thorax and horribly beaten    about the head before the mob came to the conclusion that he had been    done for, and passed on. The ambulance was called and he was picked up    and carried to the charity hospital, where his wounds were dressed and    pronounced serious.      Oswald McMahon is nothing more than a boy. He was shot in the leg and    afterward carried to the hospital. His injuries are very slight.      Dan White is another charity hospital patient. He is a Negro roustabout    and was sitting in the bar room at Poydras and Franklin Streets when a    mob passed along and espied him. He was shot in the hand, and would have    been roughly dealt with had some policeman not been luckily near and    rescued him.      In addition to the Negroes who suffered from the violence of the mob    there were several patients treated at the hospital during the night who    had been with the rioters and had been struck by stray bullets or    injured in scuffles. None of this class were hurt to any extent. They    got their wounds dressed and went out again.      +WAS CHARLES A DESPERADO?+    The press of the country has united in declaring that Robert Charles was a  desperado. As usual, when dealing with a negro, he is assumed to be guilty  because he is charged. Even the most conservative of journals refuse to  ask evidence to prove that the dead man was a criminal, and that his life  had been given over to lawbreaking. The minute that the news was flashed  across the country that he had shot a white man it was at once declared  that he was a fiend incarnate, and that when he was killed the community  would be ridden of a black-hearted desperado. The reporters of the New  Orleans papers, who were in the best position to trace the record of this  man's life, made every possible effort to find evidence to prove that he  was a villain unhung. With all the resources at their command, and  inspired by intense interest to paint him as black a villain as possible,  these reporters signally failed to disclose a single indictment which  charged Robert Charles with a crime. Because they failed to find any legal  evidence that Charles was a lawbreaker and desperado his accusers gave  full license to their imagination and distorted the facts that they had  obtained, in every way possible, to prove a course of criminality, which  the records absolutely refuse to show.    Charles had his first encounter with the police Monday night, in which he  was shot in the street duel which was begun by the police after Officer  Mora had beaten Charles three or four times over the head with his billy  in an attempt to make an illegal arrest. In defending himself against the  combined attack of two officers with a billy and their guns upon him,  Charles shot Officer Mora and escaped.    Early Tuesday morning Charles was traced to Dryades Street by officers who  were instructed to kill him on sight. There, again defending himself, he  shot and killed two officers. This, of course, in the eyes of the American  press, made him a desperado. The New Orleans press, in substantiating the  charges that he was a desperado, make statements which will be interesting  to examine.    In the first place the _New Orleans Times-Democrat_, of July 25, calls  Charles a \"ravisher and a daredevil.\" It says that from all sources that  could be searched \"the testimony was cumulative that the character of the  murderer, Robert Charles, is that of a daredevil and a fiend in human  form.\" Then in the same article it says:      The belongings of Robert Charles which were found in his room were a    complete index to the character of the man. Although the room and its    contents were in a state of chaos on account of the frenzied search for    clews by officers and citizens, an examination of his personal effects    revealed the mental state of the murderer and the rancor in his heart    toward the Caucasian race. Never was the adage, \"A little learning is a    dangerous thing,\" better exemplified than in the case of the negro who    shot to death the two officers.    His room was searched, and the"]]]
