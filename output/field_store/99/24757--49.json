Alas, the son of a _Suta_ hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife  of those who are possessed of abundant energy and might, and who are  liberal in gifts and proud of their dignity. Alas, the son of a _Suta_  hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those who, if they had  not been fettered by the ties of duty, could destroy this entire world.  Where, alas, are those mighty warriors today who, though living in  disguise, have always granted protection unto those that solicit it? Oh,  why do those heroes today, endued as they are with strength and  possessed of immeasurable energy, quietly suffer, like eunuchs, their  dear and chaste wife to be thus insulted by a _Suta's_ son? Oh, where is  that wrath of theirs, that prowess, and that energy, when they quietly  bear their wife to be thus insulted by a wicked wretch? What can I (a  weak woman) do when Virata, deficient in virtue, coolly suffereth my  innocent self to be thus wronged by a wretch? Thou dost not, O king, act  like a king towards this Kichaka. Thy behaviour is like that of a  robber, and doth not shine in a court. That I should thus be insulted in  thy very presence, O Matsya, is highly improper. Oh, let all the  courtiers here look at this violence of Kichaka. Kichaka is ignorant of  duty and morality, and Matsya also is equally so. These courtiers also  that wait upon such a king are destitute of virtue.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"With these and other words of the same kind the  beautiful Krishna with tearful eyes rebuked the king of the Matsyas. And  hearing her, Virata said, 'I do not know what your dispute has been out  of our sight. Not knowing the true cause how can I show my  discrimination?' Then the courtiers, having learnt every thing,  applauded Krishna, and they all exclaimed, 'Well done!' 'Well done!' and  censured Kichaka. And the courtiers said, 'That person who owneth this  large-eyed lady having every limb of hers endued with beauty for his  wife, possesseth what is of exceeding value and hath no occasion to  indulge in any grief. Surely, such a damsel of transcendent beauty and  limbs perfectly faultless is rare among men. Indeed, it seems to us that  she is a goddess.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"And while the courtiers, having beheld Krishna  (under such circumstances), were applauding her thus, Yudhishthira's  forehead, from ire, became covered with sweat. And that bull of the Kuru  race then addressed that princess, his beloved spouse, saying, 'Stay not  here, O Sairindhri; but retire to the apartments of Sudeshna. The wives  of heroes bear affliction for the sake of their husbands, and undergoing  toil in ministering unto their lords, they at last attain to region  where their husbands may go. Thy Gandharva husbands, effulgent as the  sun, do not, I imagine, consider this as an occasion for manifesting  their wrath, inasmuch as they do not rush to thy aid. O _Sairindhri_,  thou art ignorant of the timeliness of things, and it is for this that  thou weepest as an actress, besides interrupting the play of dice in  Matsya's court. Retire, O _Sairindhri_; the Gandharvas will do what is  agreeable to thee. And they will surely display thy woe and take the  life of him that hath wronged thee.' Hearing these words the  _Sairindhri_ replied, 'They of whom I am the wedded wife are, I ween,  extremely kind. And as the eldest of them all is addicted to dice, they  are liable to be oppressed by all.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"And having said this, the fair-hipped Krishna  with dishevelled hair and eyes red in anger, ran towards the apartments  of Sudeshna. And in consequence of having wept long her face looked  beautiful like the lunar disc in the firmament, emerged from the clouds.  And beholding her in that condition, Sudeshna asked, 'Who, O beauteous  lady, hath insulted thee? Why, O amiable damsel, dost thou weep? Who,  gentle one, hath done thee wrong? Whence is this thy grief?' Thus  addressed, Draupadi said, 'As I went to bring wine for thee, Kichaka  struck me in the court in the very presence of the king, as if in the  midst of a solitary wood.' Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'O thou of  tresses ending in beautiful curls, as Kichaka, maddened by lust hath  insulted thee that art incapable of being possessed by him, I shall  cause him to be slain if thou wishest it.' Thereupon Draupadi answered,  'Even others will slay him,--even they whom he hath wronged. I think it  is clear that he will have to go to the abode of Yama this very day!'\"      SECTION XVII    Vaisampayana said, \"Thus insulted by the _Suta's_ son, that illustrious  princess, the beautiful Krishna, eagerly wishing for the destruction of  Virata's general, went to her quarters. And Drupada's daughter of dark  hue and slender waist then performed her ablutions. And washing her body  and cloths with water Krishna began to ponder weepingly on the means of  dispelling her grief. And she reflected, saying, 'What am I to do?  Whither shall I go? How can my purpose be effected?' And while she was  thinking thus, she remembered Bhima and said to herself, 'There is none  else, save Bhima, that can today accomplish the purpose on which my  heart is set!' And afflicted with great grief, the large-eyed and  intelligent Krishna possessed of powerful protectors then rose up at  night, and leaving her bed speedily proceeded towards the quarters of  Bhimasena, desirous of beholding her lord. And possessed of great  intelligence, the daughter of Drupada entered her husband's quarters,  saying, 'How canst thou sleep while that wretched commander of Virata's  forces, who is my foe, yet liveth, having perpetrated today _that_ (foul  act)?'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then the chamber where Bhima slept, breathing  hard like a lion, being filled with the beauty of Drupada's daughter and  of the high-souled Bhima, blazed forth in splendour. And Krishna of  sweet smiles, finding Bhimasena in the cooking apartments, approached  him with the eagerness of a three-year old cow brought up in the woods,  approaching a powerful bull, in her first season, or of a she-crane  living by the water-side approaching her mate in the pairing season. And  the Princess of Panchala then embraced the second son of Pandu, even as  a creeper embraces a huge and mighty _Sala_ on the banks of the Gomati.  And embracing him with her arms, Krishna of faultless features awaked  him as a lioness awaketh a sleeping lion in a trackless forest. And  embracing Bhimasena even as a she-elephant embraceth her mighty mate,  the faultless Panchali addressed him in voice sweet as the sound of a  stringed instrument emitting _Gandhara_ note. And she said, 'Arise,  arise! Why dost thou, O Bhimasena, lie down as one dead? Surely, he that  is not dead, never suffereth a wicked wretch that hath disgraced his  wife, to live.' And awakened by the princess, Bhima of mighty arms, then  rose up, and sat upon his couch overlaid with a rich bed. And he of the  Kuru race then addressed the princess--his beloved wife, saying, 'For  what purpose hast thou come hither in such a hurry? Thy colour is gone  and thou lookest lean and pale. Tell me everything in detail. I must  know the truth. Whether it be pleasurable or painful, agreeable, or  disagreeable, tell me all. Having heard everything, I shall apply the  remedy. I alone, O Krishna, am entitled to thy confidence in all things,  for it is I who deliver thee from perils again and again! Tell me  quickly what is thy wish, and what is the purpose that is in thy view,  and return thou to thy bed before others awake.'\"      SECTION XVIII    \"Draupadi said, 'What grief hath she not who hath Yudhishthira for her  husband? Knowing all my griefs, why dost thou ask me? The _Pratikamin_  dragged me to the court in the midst of an assembly of courtiers,  calling me a slave. That grief, O Bharata, consumeth me. What other  princess, save Draupadi, would live having suffered such intense misery?  Who else, save myself, could bear such second insult as the wicked  Saindhava offered me while residing in the forest? Who else of my  position, save myself, could live, having been kicked by Kichaka in the  very sight of the wicked king of the Matsyas? Of what value is life, O  Bharata, when thou, O son of Kunti, dost not think me miserable,  although I am afflicted with such woes? That vile and wicked wretch, O  Bharata, known by the name of Kichaka, who is the brother-in-law of king  Virata and the commander of his forces, every day, O tiger among men,  addresses me who am residing in the palace as a _Sairindhri_, saying,  _Do thou become my wife_.--Thus solicited, O slayer of foes, by that  wretch deserving to be slain, my heart is bursting like a fruit ripened  in season. Censure thou that elder brother of thine addicted to  execrable dice, through whose act alone I have been afflicted with such  woe. Who else, save him that is a desperate gambler, would play, giving  up kingdom and everything including even myself, in order to lead a life  in the woods? If he had gambled morning and evening for many years  together, staking _nishkas_ by thousand and other kinds of substantial  wealth, still his silver, and gold, and robes, and vehicles, and teams,  and goats, and sheep, and multitudes of steeds and mares and mules would  not have sustained any diminution. But now deprived of prosperity by the  rivalry of dice, he sits dumb like a fool, reflecting on his own  misdeeds. Alas, he who, while sojourning, was followed by ten thousand  elephants adorned with golden garlands now supports himself by casting  dice. That Yudhishthira who at Indraprastha was adored by kings of  incomparable prowess by hundreds of thousands, that mighty monarch in  whose kitchen a hundred thousand maid-servants, plate in hand, used  every day to feed numerous guests day and night, that best of liberal  men, who gave (every day) a thousand _nishkas_, alas, even he  overwhelmed with woe in consequence of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 04 (#9)"],[1,"united, could reach that  point of clearness and definiteness of expression which he demanded of  himself. * * *    On the other hand, it would probably be agreeable to the reader of  this correspondence if I should attempt briefly to show how my opinion  of Schiller's individuality was formed by intercourse with him, by  reminiscences of his conversation, by the comparison of his  productions in their successive sequence, and by a study of the  development of his intellect.    What must necessarily have impressed every student of Schiller as most  characteristic was the fact that thinking was the very substance of  his life, in a higher and more significant sense than perhaps has ever  been the case with any other person. His intellect was alive with  spontaneous and almost tireless activity, which ceased only when the  attacks of his physical infirmity became overpowering. Such activity  seemed to him a recreation rather than an effort, and was manifested  most conspicuously in conversation, for which Schiller appeared to  have a natural aptitude.    He never sought for deep subjects of conversation, but seemed rather  to leave the introduction of a subject to chance; but from each topic  he led the discourse up to a general point of view, and after a short  dialogue one found oneself in the very midst of a mentally stimulating  discussion. He always treated the central idea as an end to be  attained in common; he always seemed to need the help of the person  with whom he was conversing, for, although the latter always felt that  the idea was supplied by Schiller alone, Schiller never allowed him to  remain inactive.    This was the chief difference between Schiller's and Herder's mode of  conversing. Never, perhaps, has there been a man who talked with  greater charm than Herder, if one happened to catch him in an  agreeable mood--not a difficult matter when any kind of note was  struck with which he was in harmony.    [Illustration: #WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT# FRANZ KRUeGER]    All the extraordinary qualities of this justly admired man seemed to  gain double power in conversation, for which they were so peculiarly  adapted. The thought blossomed forth in expression with a grace and  dignity which appeared to proceed from the subject alone, although  really belonging only to the individual. Thus speech flowed on  uninterruptedly with a limpidness which still left something remaining  for one's own imagination, and yet with a _chiaroscuro_ which did not  prevent one from definitely grasping the thought. As soon as one  subject was exhausted a new one was taken up. Nothing was gained by  making objections which would only have served as a hindrance. One had  listened, one could even talk oneself, but one felt the lack of an  interchange of thought.    Schiller's speech was not really beautiful, but his mind constantly  strove, with acumen and precision, to make new intellectual conquests;  he held this effort under control, however, and soared above his  subject in perfect liberty. Hence, with a light and delicate touch he  utilized any side-issue which presented itself, and this was the  reason why his conversation was peculiarly rich in words that are so  evidently the inspiration of the moment; yet, in spite of such seeming  freedom in the treatment of the subject, the final end was not lost  sight of. Schiller always held with firmness the thread which was  bound to lead thither, and, if the conversation was not interrupted by  any mishap, he was not prone to bring it to a close until he had  reached the goal.    And as Schiller in his conversation always aimed to add new ground to  the domain of thought, so, in general, it may be said that his  intellectual activity was always characterized by an intense  spontaneity. His letters demonstrate these traits very perceptibly,  and he knew absolutely no other method of working.    He gave himself up to mere reading late in the evening only, and  during his frequently sleepless nights. His days were occupied with  various labors or with specific preparatory studies in connection  with them, his intellect being thus kept at high tension by work and  research.    Mere studying undertaken with no immediate end in view save that of  acquiring knowledge, and which has such a fascination for those who  are familiar with it that they must be constantly on their guard lest  it cause them to neglect other more definite duties--such studying, I  say, he knew nothing about from experience, nor did he esteem it at  its proper value. Knowledge seemed to him too material, and the forces  of the intellect too noble, for him to see in this material anything  more than mere stuff to be worked up. It was only because he placed  more value upon the higher activity of the intellect, which creates  independently out of its own depths, that he had so little sympathy  with its efforts of a lower order. It is indeed remarkable from what a  small stock of material and how, in spite of wanting the means by  which such material is procured by others, Schiller obtained his  comprehensive theory of life (_Weltanschauung_), which, when once  grasped, fairly startles us by the intuitive truthfulness of genius;  for one can give no other name to that which originates without  outside aid.    Even in Germany he had traveled only in certain districts, while  Switzerland, of which his _William Tell_ contains such vivid  descriptions, he had never seen. Any one who has ever stood by the  Falls of the Rhine will involuntarily recall, at the sight, the  beautiful strophe in _The Diver_ in which this confusing tumult of  waters, that so captivates the eye, is depicted; and yet no personal  view of these rapids had served as the basis for Schiller's  description.    But whatever Schiller did acquire from his own experience he grasped  with a clearness which also brought distinctly before him what he  learned from the description of others. Besides, he never neglected to  prepare himself for every subject by exhaustive reading. Anything that  might prove to be of use, even if discovered accidentally, fixed  itself firmly in his memory; and his tirelessly-working imagination,  which, with constant liveliness, elaborated now this now that part of  the material collected from every source, filled out the deficiencies  of such second-hand information.    In a manner quite similar he made the spirit of Greek poetry his own,  although his knowledge of it was gained exclusively from translations.  In this connection he spared himself no pains. He preferred  translations which disclaimed any particular merit in themselves, and  his highest consideration was for the literal classical paraphrases.    * * * _The Cranes of Ibycus_ and the _Festival of Victory_ wear the  colors of antiquity with all the purity and fidelity which could be  expected from a modern poet, and they wear them in the most beautiful  and most spirited manner. The poet, in these works, has quite absorbed  the spirit of the ancient world; he moves about in it with freedom,  and thus creates a new form of poetry which, in all its parts,  breathes only such a spirit. The two poems, however, are in striking  contrast with each other. _The Cranes of Ibycus_ permitted a  thoroughly epic development; what made the subject of intrinsic value  to the poet was the idea which sprung from it of the power of artistic  representation upon the human soul. This power of poetry, of an  invisible force created purely by the intellect and vanishing away  when brought into contact with reality, belonged essentially to the  sphere of ideas which occupied Schiller so intensely.    As many as eight years before the time when this subject assumed the  ballad form within his mind it had floated before his vision, as is  evident in the lines which are taken from his poem _The Artists_--      \"Awed by the Furies' chorus dread    Murder draws down upon its head    The doom of death from their wild song.\"    This idea, moreover, permitted an exposition in complete harmony with  the spirit of antiquity; the latter had all the requisites for  bringing it into bold relief in all its purity and strength.  Consequently, every particular in the whole narrative is borrowed  immediately from the ancient world, especially the appearance and the  song of Eumenides. The chorus as employed by AEschylus is so  artistically interwoven with the modern poetic form, both in the  matter of rhyme and the length of the metre, that no portion of its  quiet grandeur is lost.    _The Festival of Victory_ is of a lyric, of a contemplative nature. In  this work the poet was able--indeed was compelled--to lend from his  own store an element which did not lie within the sphere of ideas and  the sentiments of antiquity; but everything else follows the spirit of  the Homeric poem with as great purity as it does in the _Cranes of  Ibycus_. The poem as a whole is clearly stamped with a higher, more  distinct, spirituality than is usual with the ancient singers; and it  is in this particular that it manifests its most conspicuous beauties.    The earlier poems of Schiller are also rich in particular traits  borrowed from the poems of the ancients, and into them he has often  introduced a higher significance than is found in the original. Let me  refer in this connection to his description of death from _The  Artists_--\"The gentle bow of necessity\"--which so beautifully recalls  the _gentle darts_ of Homer, where, however, the transfer of the  adjective from _darts_ to _bow_ gives to the thought a more tender and  a deeper significance.    Confidence in the intellectual power of man heightened to poetic form  is expressed in the distichs entitled _Columbus_, which are among the  most peculiar poetic productions that Schiller has given us. Belief in  the invisible force inherent in man, in the opinion, which is sublime  and deeply true, that there must be an inward mystic harmony between  it and the"]]]
