He will be with us also. I       most sincerely congratulate you, dear friend, also the young hero,       your dear son, the Crown Prince, and the Crown Prince Rupprecht, as       well as the incomparably brave German Army.

The glorious victories, so crushing to the foe, which the German       Army has won in battle under your chief command owe their begetting       and their success to your iron will, which sharpened and swung the       heavy sword.         To the laurel that crowns you as victor I wish to add, if I may,       the highest military honor which we possess, in begging you to take       in true brotherhood of arms and as a token of my appreciation the       Great Cross of my military Order of Marie Theresa. The decoration       itself, dear friend, shall be handed to you by a special envoy as       soon as it is convenient for you.             *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: COUNT LEOPOLD BERCHTOLD.  Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs.  (_Photo from Underwood & Underwood._)]               A PURELY DEFENSIVE WAR.    By Count Berchtold, Foreign Minister for Austria-Hungary.    (Copyright, Evening News Publishing Company of Newark, N.J., 1914.)           Austria-Hungary looks upon this war as a purely defensive one,       which has been forced on her by the agitation directed by Russia       against her very existence. Austria-Hungary has given many proofs       in late years of her peaceful intention. She refrained from any       interference with arms in the Balkan war, though her interests were       at stake. Subsequent events have proved what a serious danger the       increase in territory and prestige which it brought Servia were for       Austria-Hungary. Servia's ambitions have since grown and have been       solely directed against the Dual Monarchy. Russia has tacitly       approved of Servia's action because Russian statesmen wish to form       an iron ring of enemies around Austria-Hungary and Germany in order       that Russia's grasp on Constantinople and on Asia should never       again be meddled with. Austro-Hungarian soldiers are fighting for       their homes and for the maintenance of their country, the Russians       are fighting to help the Russian Czar to gain the rule of the       world, to destroy all his neighbors who may be dangerous to Russian       ambitions. England is helping the Russians to oust her German       rival. She feared for some time that German culture and German       scientific methods would prove the stronger in a peaceful       competition, and she now hopes to crush Germany with the help of       Russia and France. And France is fighting to win back       Alsace-Lorraine, to take her revenge on Germany, which the French       nation has been aiming at for the last forty-four years.         That is how Austria-Hungary looks upon the war. She never wished       for territorial increase, she wished for peace and that her people       should develop in safety.         Germany equally had nothing to gain by a war, but Germany knows       that Austria-Hungary's enemies are her enemies and that the       dismemberment of the Hapsburg monarchy would mean the isolation of       the German Empire.         And so, after all efforts to keep Russia and England from breaking       the peace of Europe had failed, she drew her sword to defend her       and her allies' (ally's) interests.         Truth and honor are on the side of the two empires in this war, the       unspeakable inventions and prevarications published by the French,       Russian, and English press in the last weeks alone must prove to       the American people who can afford to tell the truth and nothing       but the truth in this war.         The Austro-Hungarian and German people have a clear conscience and       need fear no misrepresentation of their action.             *       *       *       *       *          A DISCORDANT NOTE.    By Count Michael Karolyi, Leader of Hungarian Independent Party, New  York, July 27.           If Austria had pursued a policy of directly helping the Balkan       countries, if Austria had in the past made it a point to be       actively their friend, this war would not confront us. Since it has       come, of course all Hungarians will support the empire and internal       differences will be dismissed while the empire is imperiled.         As for the loyalty of the many Serbs within Austria-Hungary it is       hard to say. There again we must hope that they will take the       Austrian side. But the Austrian policy toward the Balkan countries       has been wrong, all wrong.             *       *       *       *       *          A German Review of the Evidence               *       *       *       *       *          Certified by Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, German Ex-Colonial  Secretary.      _The following is presented as a complete defense of the German position  in the present war and is based upon examination of the German and  English \"White Papers.\" It was prepared in Germany and forwarded to Dr.  Bernhard Dernburg, who had it translated for_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _of  Nov. 1, 1914_.    _Dr. Dernburg gives this statement his full approval and accepts complete  responsibility for it._      Two of the five great European powers that are at present engaged in  war, Austria-Hungary and Russia, whose differences for years have been  constantly increasing in sharpness, and after the tragedy in Serajevo  became impossible to be bridged by diplomacy, conjured up the frightful  struggle.    With these two, two other powers are so closely united by alliances that  their participation in the war also was unavoidable; they are Germany  and France.    There are two other great European powers whose relations to the two  aforesaid groups before the war were very much alike in the essential  points. Just as Italy was politically tied by alliance to the central  powers, so England was with the Franco-Russian Alliance. Hence it was  uncertain how these countries, each geographically removed from the main  body of the Continent, would act in a war, and it seemed quite possible  that both would decide to remain neutral.    As a matter of fact, the Italian Government came to the view that such a  stand would be for the best interests of its country.    This decision might have made it considerably more easy for England to  also maintain her neutrality, which, from political, economical, and  ethical reasons, would have been advantageous and natural for the Island  Empire. To the surprise and indignation of all those Germans who for  years had been working toward an adjustment of the conflicting interests  of both countries--among these ought to be mentioned, above all, the  Kaiser and the Imperial Chancellor--the Liberal British Ministry  immediately declared war on Germany, and did not confine itself to a  naval war, but, in keeping with agreements reached years ago between the  English and the French General Staffs, as is now admitted, equipped an  expeditionary army, thus considerably strengthening the French forces.    The question arises, \"What reasons led British politics to this  monstrous step?\"    Much has been written during the last weeks from the German side,  criticising most sharply and with great justification the motive of the  London Cabinet. In the following discussion we will confine ourselves to  an impartial review of the documents published by the English Government  itself in its own defense.    The essential part of this justification is contained in the  \"Correspondence Concerning the European Crisis,\" placed before the  British Parliament shortly after the start of the war, which is known as  the British \"White Paper.\" In amplification are to be considered the  \"White Book\" placed by the German Government before the Reichstag and  the \"Orange Book\" published by Russia.             *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: STATE COUNCILLOR SAZONOF  Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.  (_Photo (C) by American Press Assn._)]          I.    THE RUSSIAN MOBILIZATION.      In a public speech, delivered Sept. 19, the Secretary of the Treasury,  Mr. Lloyd George, according to the report of The Westminster Gazette,  which may be considered as his organ, characterized the quarrel between  Germany and Russia in the picturesque manner which this statesman  prefers, as follows:         GERMANY--I insist that you stand aside with crossed arms while       Austria strangles your little brother, (Servia.)         RUSSIA--Just you touch this little fellow and I will tear       your ramshackle empire limb from limb.    We will not waste words in considering the flippant form here used in a  discussion of an unspeakably bloody and world-historic conflict. But  this expression in very pregnant form makes Russia appear in the light  in which the London powers-that-be desire to show the empire of the Czar  to the British people, viz., in the role of the noble-hearted protector  of persecuted innocence, while Germany, supporting and egging on  Austria-Hungary, is shown as morally responsible for the war.    Cites English Documents.    This, also, is the chain of thought in the speech of the British Prime  Minister in the House of Commons on Aug. 4. Translations of this speech  have been spread by the British Government in neutral countries in  hundreds of thousands of copies under the title: \"The Power Responsible  for War Is Germany.\"    Now, we claim that the British \"White Paper\" itself furnishes  irrefutable proof that not Germany, which up to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#9)"],[1,"was at five or six in the evening. We  may observe this in the preface to the Heptameron of the Queen of  Navarre, where this princess, describing the mode of life which the  lords and ladies whom she assembles at the castle of Madame Oysille,  should follow, to be agreeably occupied and to banish languor, thus  expresses herself: \"As soon as the morning rose, they went to the  chamber of Madame Oysille, whom they found already at her prayers; and  when they had heard during a good hour her lecture, and then the mass,  they went to dine at ten o'clock; and afterwards each privately retired  to his room, but did not fail at noon to meet in the meadow.\" Speaking  of the end of the first day (which was in September) the same lady  Oysille says, \"Say where is the sun? and hear the bell of the abbey,  which has for some time called us to vespers; in saying this they all  rose and went to the religionists _who had waited for them above an  hour_. Vespers heard, they went to supper, and after having played a  thousand sports in the meadow they retired to bed.\" All this exactly  corresponds with the lines above quoted. Charles V. of France, however,  who lived near two centuries before Francis, dined at ten, supped at  seven, and all the court was in bed by nine o'clock. They sounded the  curfew, which bell warned them to cover their fire, at six in the  winter, and between eight and nine in the summer. Under the reign of  Henry IV. the hour of dinner at court was eleven, or at noon the latest;  a custom which prevailed even in the early part of the reign of Louis  XIV. In the provinces distant from Paris, it is very common to dine at  nine; they make a second repast about two o'clock, sup at five; and  their last meal is made just before they retire to bed. The labourers  and peasants in France have preserved this custom, and make three meals;  one at nine, another at three, and the last at the setting of the sun.    The Marquis of Mirabeau, in \"L'Ami des Hommes,\" Vol. I. p. 261, gives a  striking representation of the singular industry of the French citizens  of that age. He had learnt from several ancient citizens of Paris, that  if in their youth a workman did not work two hours by candle-light,  either in the morning or evening, he even adds in the longest days, he  would have been noticed as an idler, and would not have found persons  to employ him. On the 12th of May, 1588, when Henry III. ordered his  troops to occupy various posts at Paris, Davila writes that the  inhabitants, warned by the noise of the drums, began to shut their doors  and shops, which, according to the customs of that town to work before  daybreak, were already opened. This must have been, taking it at the  latest, about four in the morning. \"In 1750,\" adds the ingenious writer,  \"I walked on that day through Paris at full six in the morning; I passed  through the most busy and populous part of the city, and I only saw open  some stalls of the vendors of brandy!\"    To the article, \"Anecdotes of Fashions,\" (see Vol. I., p. 216) we may  add, that in England a taste for splendid dress existed in the reign of  Henry VII.; as is observable by the following description of Nicholas  Lord Vaux. \"In the 17th of that reign, at the marriage of Prince Arthur,  the brave young Vaux appeared in a gown of purple velvet, adorned with  pieces of gold so thick, and massive, that, exclusive of the silk and  furs, it was valued at a thousand pounds. About his neck he wore a  collar of SS, weighing eight hundred pounds in nobles. In those days it  not only required great bodily strength to support the weight of their  cumbersome armour; their very luxury of apparel for the drawing-room  would oppress a system of modern muscles.\"    In the following reign, according to the monarch's and Wolsey's  magnificent taste, their dress was, perhaps, more generally sumptuous.  We then find the following rich ornaments in vogue. Shirts and shifts  were embroidered with gold, and bordered with lace. Strutt notices also  perfumed gloves lined with white velvet, and splendidly worked with  embroidery and gold buttons. Not only gloves, but various other parts of  their habits, were perfumed; shoes were made of Spanish perfumed skins.    Carriages were not then used;[17] so that lords would carry princesses  on a pillion behind them, and in wet weather the ladies covered their  heads with hoods of oil-cloth: a custom that has been generally  continued to the middle of the seventeenth century. Coaches were  introduced into England by Fitzalan Earl of Arundel, in 1580, and at  first were only drawn by a pair of horses. The favourite Buckingham,  about 1619, began to have them drawn by six horses; and Wilson, in his  life of James I., tells us this \"was wondered at as a novelty, and  imputed to him as a mastering pride.\" The same _arbiter elegantiarum_  introduced sedan-chairs. In France, Catherine of Medicis was the first  who used a coach, which had leathern doors and curtains, instead of  glass windows. If the carriage of Henry IV. had had glass windows, this  circumstance might have saved his life. Carriages were so rare in the  reign of this monarch, that in a letter to his minister Sully, he  notices that having taken medicine that day, though he intended to have  called on him, he was prevented because the queen had gone out with the  carriage. Even as late as in the reign of Louis XIV. the courtiers rode  on horseback to their dinner parties, and wore their light boots and  spurs. Count Hamilton describes his boots of white Spanish leather, with  gold spurs.    Saint Foix observes, that in 1658 there were only 310 coaches in Paris,  and in 1758 there were more than 14,000.    Strutt has judiciously observed, that though \"luxury and grandeur were  so much affected, and appearances of state and splendour carried to such  lengths, we may conclude that their household furniture and domestic  necessaries were also carefully attended to; on passing through their  houses, we may expect to be surprised at the neatness, elegance, and  superb appearance of each room, and the suitableness of every ornament;  but herein we may be deceived. The taste of elegance amongst our  ancestors was very different from the present, and however we may find  them extravagant in their apparel, excessive in their banquets, and  expensive in their trains of attendants; yet, follow them home, and  within their houses you shall find their furniture is plain and homely;  no great choice, but what was useful, rather than any for ornament or  show.\"    Erasmus, as quoted by Jortin, confirms this account, and makes it worse;  he gives a curious account of English dirtiness; he ascribes the plague,  from which England was hardly ever free, and the sweating-sickness,  partly to the incommodious form, and bad exposition of the houses, to  the filthiness of the streets, and to the sluttishness within doors.  \"The floors,\" says he, \"are commonly of clay, strewed with rushes; under  which lies, unmolested, an ancient collection of beer, grease,  fragments, bones, spittle, excrement of dogs and cats, and everything  that is nasty.\"[18] And NOW, certainly we are the cleanest nation in  Europe, and the word COMFORTABLE expresses so peculiar an idea, that it  has been adopted by foreigners to describe a sensation experienced  nowhere but in England.    I shall give a sketch of the domestic life of a nobleman in the reign of  Charles the First, from the \"Life of the Duke of Newcastle,\" written by  his Duchess, whom I have already noticed. It might have been impertinent  at the time of its publication; it will now please those who are curious  about English manners.                          \"_Of his Habit_.    \"He accoutres his person according to the fashion, if it be one that is  not troublesome and uneasy for men of heroic exercises and actions. He  is neat and cleanly; which makes him to be somewhat long in dressing,  though not so long as many effeminate persons are. He shifts ordinarily  once a day, and every time when he uses exercise, or his temper is more  hot than ordinary.                           \"_Of his Diet_.    \"In his diet he is so sparing and temperate, that he never eats nor  drinks beyond his set proportion, so as to satisfy only his natural  appetite; he makes but one meal a day, at which he drinks two good  glasses of small beer, one about the beginning, the other at the end  thereof, and a little glass of sack in the middle of his dinner; which  glass of sack he also uses in the morning for his breakfast, with a  morsel of bread. His supper consists of an egg and a draught of small  beer. And by this temperance he finds himself very healthful, and may  yet live many years, he being now of the age of seventy-three.                  \"_His Recreation and Exercise_.    \"His prime pastime and recreation hath always been the exercise of  mannage and weapons, which heroic arts he used to practise every day;  but I observing that when he had overheated himself he would be apt to  take cold, prevailed so far, that at last he left the frequent use of  the mannage, using nevertheless still the exercise of weapons; and  though he doth not ride himself so frequently as he hath done, yet he  taketh delight in seeing his horses of mannage rid by his escuyers, whom  he instructs in that art for his own pleasure. But in the art of weapons  (in which he has a method beyond all that ever was famous in it, found  out by his own ingenuity and practice) he never taught any body but the  now Duke of Buckingham, whose guardian he hath been, and his own two  sons. The rest of his time he spends in music, poetry, architecture, and  the like.\"    The value of money, and the increase of our opulence, might form, says  Johnson, a curious subject of research. In the reign of Edward the  Sixth, Latimer mentions it as a proof of his father's prosperity, that  though but a yeoman, he gave his daughters five pounds each"]]]
