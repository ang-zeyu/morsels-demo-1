Scarcely was she  mistress of Cisalpine Gaul when she entered upon a quarrel with the  tribes which occupied the mountain-passes.  With an unsettled frontier,  and between neighbors of whom one is ambitious and the other barbarian,  pretexts and even causes are never wanting.  It is likely that the Gallic  mountaineers were not careful to abstain, they and their flocks, from  descending upon the territory that had become Roman.  The Romans, in  turn, penetrated into the hamlets, carried off flocks and people, and  sold them in the public markets at Cremona, at Placentia, and in all  their colonies.    The Gauls of the Alps demanded succor of the Transalpine Gauls, applying  to a powerful chieftain, named Cincibil, whose influence extended  throughout the mountains.  But the terror of the Roman name had reached  across.  Cincibil sent to Rome a deputation, with his brother at their  head, to set forth the grievances of the mountaineers, and especially to  complain of the consul Cassius, who had carried off and sold several  thousands of Gauls.  Without making any concession, the Senate was  gracious.  Cassius was away; he must be waited for.  Meanwhile the Gauls  were well treated; Cincibil and his brother received as presents two  golden collars, five silver vases, two horses fully caparisoned, and  Roman dresses for all their suite.  Still nothing was done.    Another, a greater and more decisive opportunity offered itself.  Marseilles was an ally of the Romans.  As the rival of Carthage, and with  the Gauls forever at her gates, she had need of Rome by sea and land.  She pretended, also, to the most eminent and intimate friendship with  Rome.  Her founder, the Phocean Euxenes, had gone to Rome, it was said,  and concluded a treaty with Tarquinius Priscus.  She had gone into  mourning when Rome was burned by the Gauls; she had ordered a public levy  to aid towards the ransom of the Capitol.  Rome did not dispute these  claims to remembrance.  The friendship of Marseilles was of great use to  her.  In the whole course of her struggle with Carthage, and but lately,  at the passage of Hannibal through Gaul, Rome had met with the best of  treatment there.  She granted the Massilians a place amongst her senators  at the festivals of the Republic, and exemption from all duty in her  ports.  Towards the middle of the second century B.C. Marseilles was at  war with certain Gallic tribes, her neighbors, whose territory she  coveted.  Two of her colonies, Nice and Antibes, were threatened.  She  called on Rome for help.  A Roman deputation went to decide the quarrel;  but the Gauls refused to obey its summons, and treated it with insolence.  The deputation returned with an army, succeeded in beating the refractory  tribes, and gave their land to the Massilians.  The same thing occurred  repeatedly with the same result.  Within the space of thirty years nearly  all the tribes between the Rhone and the Var, in the country which was  afterwards Provence, were subdued and driven back amongst the mountains,  with notice not to approach within a mile of the coast in general, and a  mile and a half of the places of disembarkation.  But the Romans did not  stop there.  They did not mean to conquer for Marseilles alone.  In the  year 123 B.C., at some leagues to the north of the Greek city, near a  little river, then called the Coenus and nowadays the Arc, the consul  C. Sextius Calvinus had noticed, during his campaign, an abundance of  thermal springs, agreeably situated amidst wood-covered hills.  There he  constructed an enclosure, aqueducts, baths, houses, a town in fact, which  he called after himself, Aquae Sextice, the modern Aix, the first Roman  establishment in Transalpine Gaul.  As in the case of Cisalpine Gaul,  with Roman colonies came Roman intrigue and dissensions got up and  fomented amongst the Gauls.  And herein Marseilles was a powerful  seconder; for she kept up communications with all the neighboring tribes,  and fanned the spirit of faction.  After his victories, the consul  C. Sextius, seated at his tribunal, was selling his prisoners by auction,  when one of them came up to him and said, \"I have always liked and served  the Romans; and for that reason I have often incurred outrage and danger  at the hands of my countrymen.\"  The consul had him set free,--him and  his family,--and even gave him leave to point out amongst the captives  any for whom he would like to procure the same kindness.  At his request  nine hundred were released.  The man's name was Crato, a Greek name,  which points to a connection with Marseilles or one of her colonies.  The  Gauls, moreover, ran of themselves into the Roman trap.  Two of their  confederations, the AEduans, of whom mention has already been made, and  the Allobrogians, who were settled between the Alps, the Isere, and the  Rhone, were at war.  A third confederation, the most powerful in Gaul at  this time, the Arvernians, who were rivals of the AEduans, gave their  countenance to the Allobrogians.  The AEduans, with whom the Massilians  had commercial dealings, solicited through these latter the assistance of  Rome.  A treaty was easily concluded.  The AEduans obtained from the  Romans the title of friends and allies; and the Romans received from the  AEduans that of brothers, which amongst the Gauls implied a sacred tie.  The consul Domitius forthwith commanded the Allobrogians to respect the  territory of the allies of Rome.  The Allobrogians rose up in arms and  claimed the aid of the Arvernians.  But even amongst them, in the very  heart of Gaul, Rome was much dreaded; she was not to be encountered  without hesitation.  So Bituitus, King of the Arvernians, was for trying  accommodation.  He was a powerful and wealthy chieftain.  His father  Luern used to give amongst the mountains magnificent entertainments; he  had a space of twelve square furlongs enclosed, and dispensed wine, mead,  and beer from cisterns made within the enclosure; and all the Arvernians  crowded to his feasts.  Bituitus displayed before the Romans his barbaric  splendor.  A numerous escort, superbly clad, surrounded his ambassador;  in attendance were packs of enormous hounds; and in front; went a bard,  or poet, who sang, with rotte or harp in hand, the glory of Bituitus and  of the Arvernian people.  Disdainfully the consul received and sent back  the embassy.  War broke out; the Allobrogians, with the usual confidence  and hastiness of all barbarians, attacked alone, without waiting for the  Arvernians, and were beaten at the confluence of the Rhone and the  Sorgue, a little above Avignon.  The next year, 121 B.C., the Arvernians  in their turn descended from the mountains, and crossed the Rhone with  all their tribes, diversely armed and clad, and ranged each about its own  chieftain.  In his barbaric vanity, Bituitus marched to war with the same  pomp that he had in vain displayed to obtain peace.  He sat upon a car  glittering with silver; he wore a plaid of striking colors; and he  brought in his train a pack of war-hounds.  At the sight of the Roman  legions, few in number, iron-clad, in serried ranks that took up little  space, he contemptuously cried, \"There is not a meal for my hounds.\"    The Arvernians were beaten, as the Allobrogians had been.  The hounds of  Bituitus were of little use to him against the elephants which the Romans  had borrowed from Asiatic usage, and which spread consternation amongst  the Gauls.  The Roman historians say that the Arvernian army was two  hundred thousand strong, and that one hundred and twenty thousand were  slain; but the figures are absurd, like most of those found in ancient  chronicles.  We know nowadays, thanks to modern civilization, which shows  everything in broad daylight, and measures everything with proper  caution, that only the most populous and powerful nations, and that at  great expenditure of trouble and time, can succeed in moving armies of  two hundred thousand men, and that no battle, however murderous it may  be, ever costs one hundred and twenty thousand lives.    Rome treated the Arvernians with consideration; but the Allobrogians lost  their existence as a nation.  The Senate declared them subject to the  Roman people; and all the country comprised between the Alps, the Rhone  from its entry into the Lake of Geneva to its mouth, and the  Mediterranean, was made a Roman consular province, which means that every  year a consul must march thither with his army.  In the three following  years, indeed, the consuls extended the boundaries of the new province,  on the right bank of the Rhone, to the frontier of the Pyrenees  southward.  In the year 115 B.C. a colony of Roman citizens was conducted  to Narbonne, a town even then of importance, in spite of the objections  made by certain senators who were unwilling, say the historians, so to  expose Roman citizens \"to the waves of barbarism.\"  This was the second  colony which went and established itself out of Italy; the first had been  founded on the ruins of Carthage.    Having thus completed their conquest, the Senate, to render possession  safe and sure, decreed the occupation of the passes of the Alps which  opened Gaul to Italy.  There was up to that time no communication with  Gaul save along the Mediterranean, by a narrow and difficult path, which  has become in our time the beautiful route called the Corniche.  The  mountain tribes defended their independence with desperation; when that  of the Stumians, who occupied the pass of the maritime Alps, saw their  inability to hold their own, they cut the throats of their wives and  children, set fire to their houses, and threw themselves into the flames.  But the Senate pursued its course imperturbably.  All the chief defiles  of the Alps fell into its hands.

On arriving,  in the early part of August, at Aigues-Mortes, he found assembled there a  fleet of thirty-eight vessels with a certain number of transport-ships  which he had hired from the republic of Genoa; and they were to convey to  the East the troops and personal retinue of the king himself.  The number  of these vessels proves that Louis was far from bringing one of those  vast armies with which the first crusades had been familiar; it even  appears that he had been careful to get rid of such mobs, for, before  embarking, he sent away nearly ten thousand bow-men, Genoese, Venetian,  Pisan, and even French, whom he had at first engaged, and of whom, after  inspection, he desired nothing further.  The sixth crusade was the  personal achievement of St. Louis, not the offspring of a popular  movement, and he carried it out with a picked army, furnished by the  feudal chivalry and by the religious and military orders dedicated to the  service of the Holy Land.    The Isle of Cyprus was the trysting-place appointed for all the forces of  the expedition.  Louis arrived there on the 12th of September, 1248, and  reckoned upon remaining there only a few days; for it was Egypt that he  was in a hurry to reach.  The Christian world was at that time of opinion  that, to deliver the Holy Land, it was necessary first of all to strike a  blow at Islamism in Egypt, wherein its chief strength resided.  But  scarcely had the crusaders formed a junction in Cyprus, when the vices of  the expedition and the weaknesses of its chief began to be manifest.  Louis, unshakable in his religious zeal, was wanting in clear ideas and  fixed resolves as to the carrying out of his design; he inspired his  associates with sympathy rather than exercised authority over them, and  he made himself admired without making himself obeyed.  He did not  succeed in winning a majority in the council of chiefs over to his  opinion as to the necessity for a speedy departure for Egypt; it was  decided to pass the winter in Cyprus, and during this leisurely halt of  seven months, the improvidence of the crusaders, their ignorance of the  places, people, and facts amidst which they were about to launch  themselves, their headstrong rashness, their stormy rivalries, and their  moral and military irregularities aggravated the difficulties of the  enterprise, great as they already were.  Louis passed his time in  interfering between them, in hushing up their quarrels, in upbraiding  them for their licentiousness, and in reconciling the Templars and  Hospitallers.  His kindness was injurious to his power; he lent too ready  an ear to the wishes or complaints of his comrades, and small matters  took up his thoughts and his time almost as much as great.    At last a start was made from Cyprus in May, 1249, and, in spite of  violent gales of wind which dispersed a large number of vessels, they  arrived on the 4th of June before Damietta.    The crusader-chiefs met on board the king's ship, the Mountjoy; and one  of those present, Guy, a knight in the train of the Count of Melun, in a  letter to one of his friends; a student at Paris, reports to him the  king's address in the following terms: \"My friends and lieges, we shall  be invincible if we be inseparable in brotherly love.  It was not without  the will of God that we arrived here so speedily.  Descend we upon this  land and occupy it in force.  I am not the King of France.  I am not Holy  Church.  It is all ye who are King and Holy Church.  I am but a man whose  life will pass away as that of any other man whenever it shall please  God.  Any issue of our expedition is to usward good; if we be conquered  we shall wing our way to heaven as martyrs; and if we be conquerors, men  will celebrate the glory of the Lord; and that of France, and, what is  more, that of Christendom, will grow thereby.  It were senseless to  suppose that God, whose providence is over everything, raised me up for  nought: He will see in us His own, His mighty cause.  Fight we for  Christ; it is Christ who will triumph in us, not for our own sake, but  for the honor and blessedness of His name.\"  It was determined to  disembark the next day.  An army of Saracens lined the shore.  The galley  which bore the oriflamme was one of the first to touch.  When the king  heard tell that the banner of St. Denis was on shore, he, in spite of the  pope's legate, who was with him, would not leave it; he leaped into the  sea, which was up to his arm-pits, and went, shield on neck, helm on  head, and lance in hand, and joined his people on the sea-shore.  When he  came to land, and perceived the Saracens, he asked what folk they were,  and it was told him that they were the Saracens; then he put his lance  beneath his arm and his shield in front of him, and would have charged  the Saracens, if his mighty men, who were with him, had suffered him.    This, from his very first outset, was Louis exactly, the most fervent of  Christians and the most splendid of knights, much rather than a general  and a king.    Such he appeared at the moment of landing, and such he was during the  whole duration, and throughout all the incidents of his campaign in  Egypt, from June, 1249, to May, 1250: ever admirable for his moral  greatness and knightly valor, but without foresight or consecutive plan  as a leader, without efficiency as a commander in action, and ever  decided or biassed either by his own momentary impressions or the fancies  of his comrades.  He took Damietta without the least difficulty.  The  Mussulmans, stricken with surprise as much as terror, abandoned the  place; and when Fakr-Eddin, the commandant of the Turks, came before the  Sultan of Egypt, Malek-Saleh, who was ill, and almost dying, \"Couldst  thou not have held out for at least an instant?\"  said the sultan.  \"What! not a single one of you got slain!\"  Having become masters of  Damietta,  St. Louis and the crusaders committed the same fault there as  in the Isle of Cyprus: they halted there for an indefinite time.  They  were expecting fresh crusaders; and they spent the time of expectation in  quarrelling over the partition of the booty taken in the city.  They made  away with it, they wasted it blindly.  \"The barons,\" said Joinville,  \"took to giving grand banquets, with an excess of meats; and the people  of the common sort took up with bad women.\"  Louis saw and deplored these  irregularities, without being in a condition to stop them.    At length, on the 20th of November, 1249, after more than five months'  inactivity at Damietta, the crusaders put themselves once more in motion,  with the determination of marching upon Babylon, that outskirt of Cairo,  now called _Old Cairo,_ which the greater part of them, in their  ignorance, mistook for the real Babylon, and where they flattered  themselves they would find immense riches, and avenge the olden  sufferings of the Hebrew captives.  The Mussulmans had found time to  recover from their first fright, and to organize, at all points, a  vigorous resistance.  On the 8th of February, 1250, a battle took place  twenty leagues from Damietta, at Mansourah (the city of victory), on the  right bank of the Nile.  The king's brother, Robert, Count of Artois,  marched with the vanguard, and obtained an early success; but William de  Sonnac, grand master of the Templars, and William Longsword, Earl of  Salisbury, leader of the English crusaders but lately arrived at  Damietta, insisted upon his waiting for the king before pushing the  victory to the uttermost.  Robert taxed them, ironically, with caution.  \"Count Robert,\" said William Longsword, \"we shall be presently where  thou'lt not dare to come nigh the tail of my horse.\"  There came a  message from the king ordering his brother to wait for him; but Robert  made no account of it.\"  I have already put the Saracens to flight,\" said  he, \"and I will wait for none to complete their defeat; \"and he rushed  forward into Mansourah.  All those who had dissuaded him followed after;  they found the Mussulmans numerous and perfectly rallied; in a few  moments the Count of Artois fell, pierced with wounds, and more than  three hundred knights of his train, the same number of English, together  with their leader, William Longsword, and two hundred and eighty  Templars, paid with their lives for the senseless ardor of the French  prince.    The king hurried up in all haste to the aid of his brother; but he had  scarcely arrived, and as yet knew nothing of his brother's fate, when he  himself engaged so impetuously in the battle that he was on the point of  being taken prisoner by six Saracens who had already seized the reins of  his horse.  He was defending himself vigorously with his sword, when  several of his knights came up with him, and set him free.  He asked one  of them if he had any news of his brother; and the other answered,  \"Certainly I have news of him: for I am sure that he is now in Paradise.\"  \"Praised be God!\" answered the king, with a tear or two, and went on with  his fighting.  The battle-field was left that day to the crusaders; but  they were not allowed to occupy it as conquerors, for, three days  afterwards, on the 11th of February, 1250, the camp of  St. Louis was  assailed by clouds of Saracens, horse and foot,"]]]
