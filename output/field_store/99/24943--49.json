I am friendless here, and ye are all against me, but I will not  be silent, and brook to have lies spoken of me.\"    Even Blunt stood aghast at Myles's boldness. Never had he heard any one  so speak to Sir James before. He did not dare for the moment even to  look up. Second after second of dead stillness passed, while Sir James  sat looking at Myles with a stern, terrifying calmness that chilled him  in spite of the heat of his passion.    \"Sir,\" said the old man at last, in a hard, quiet voice, \"thou dost know  naught of rules and laws of such a place as this. Nevertheless, it  is time for thee to learn them. So I will tell thee now that if thou  openest thy lips to say only one single word more except at my bidding,  I will send thee to the black vault of the donjon to cool thy hot  spirits on bread and water for a week.\" There was something in the  measured quietness of the old knight's tone that quelled Myles utterly  and entirely. A little space of silence followed. \"Now, then, Blunt,\"  said Sir James, turning to the bachelor, \"tell me all the ins and outs  of this business without any more underdealing.\"    This time Blunt's story, though naturally prejudiced in his own favor,  was fairly true. Then Myles told his side of the case, the old knight  listening attentively.    \"Why, how now, Blunt,\" said Sir James, when Myles had ended, \"I myself  gave the lads leave to go to the river to bathe. Wherefore shouldst thou  forbid one of them?\"    \"I did it but to punish this fellow for his mutiny,\" said the bachelor.  \"Methought we at their head were to have oversight concerning them.\"    \"So ye are,\" said the knight; \"but only to a degree. Ere ye take it upon  ye to gainsay any of my orders or permits, come ye first to me. Dost  thou understand?\"    \"Aye,\" answered Blunt, sullenly.    \"So be it, and now get thee gone,\" said the knight; \"and let me hear no  more of beating out brains with wooden clogs. An ye fight your battles,  let there not be murder in them. This is twice that the like hath  happed; gin I hear more of such doings--\" He did utter his threat, but  stopped short, and fixed his one eye sternly upon the head squire. \"Now  shake hands, and be ye friends,\" said he, abruptly.    Blunt made a motion to obey, but Myles put his hand behind him.    \"Nay, I shake not hands with any one who struck me while I was down.\"    \"So be it,\" said the knight, grimly. \"Now thou mayst go, Blunt. Thou,  Falworth, stay; I would bespeak thee further.\"    \"Tell me,\" said he, when the elder lad had left them, \"why wilt thou not  serve these bachelors as the other squires do? Such is the custom here.  Why wilt thou not obey it?\"    \"Because,\" said Myles, \"I cannot stomach it, and they shall not make me  serve them. An thou bid me do it, sir, I will do it; but not at their  command.\"    \"Nay,\" said the knight, \"I do not bid thee do them service. That lieth  with thee, to render or not, as thou seest fit. But how canst thou hope  to fight single-handed against the commands of a dozen lads all older  and mightier than thou?\"    \"I know not,\" said Myles; \"but were they an hundred, instead of  thirteen, they should not make me serve them.\"    \"Thou art a fool!\" said the old knight, smiling faintly, \"for that be'st  not courage, but folly. When one setteth about righting a wrong, one  driveth not full head against it, for in so doing one getteth naught but  hard knocks. Nay, go deftly about it, and then, when the time is ripe,  strike the blow. Now our beloved King Henry, when he was the Earl of  Derby, what could he have gained had he stood so against the old King  Richard, brooking the King face to face? I tell thee he would have been  knocked on the head as thou wert like to have been this day. Now were  I thee, and had to fight a fight against odds, I would first get me  friends behind me, and then--\" He stopped short, but Myles understood  him well enough.    \"Sir,\" said he, with a gulp, \"I do thank thee for thy friendship, and  ask thy pardon for doing as I did anon.\"    \"I grant thee pardon,\" said the knight, \"but tell thee plainly, an thou  dost face me so again, I will truly send thee to the black cell for a  week. Now get thee away.\"    All the other lads were gone when Myles came forth, save only the  faithful Gascoyne, who sacrificed his bath that day to stay with his  friend; and perhaps that little act of self-denial moved Myles more than  many a great thing might have done.    \"It was right kind of thee, Francis,\" said he, laying his hand  affectionately on his friend's shoulder. \"I know not why thou lovest me  so.\"    \"Why, for one thing, this matter,\" answered his friend; \"because  methinks thou art the best fighter and the bravest one of all of us  squires.\"    Myles laughed. Nevertheless Gascoyne's words were a soothing balm for  much that had happened that day. \"I will fight me no more just now,\"  said he; and then he told his friend all that Sir James had advised  about biding his time.    Gascoyne blew a long whistle. \"Beshrew me!\" quoth he, \"but methinks old  Bruin is on thy side of the quarrel, Myles. An that be so, I am with  thee also, and others that I can name as well.\"    \"So be it,\" said Myles. \"Then am I content to abide the time when we may  become strong enough to stand against them.\"        CHAPTER 10    Perhaps there is nothing more delightful in the romance of boyhood than  the finding of some secret hiding-place whither a body may creep away  from the bustle of the world's life, to nestle in quietness for an hour  or two. More especially is such delightful if it happen that, by  peeping from out it, one may look down upon the bustling matters of  busy every-day life, while one lies snugly hidden away unseen by any, as  though one were in some strange invisible world of one's own.    Such a hiding-place as would have filled the heart of almost any boy  with sweet delight Myles and Gascoyne found one summer afternoon. They  called it their Eyry, and the name suited well for the roosting-place  of the young hawks that rested in its windy stillness, looking down upon  the shifting castle life in the courts below.    Behind the north stable, a great, long, rambling building, thick-walled,  and black with age, lay an older part of the castle than that peopled  by the better class of life--a cluster of great thick walls, rudely but  strongly built, now the dwelling-place of stable-lads and hinds, swine  and poultry. From one part of these ancient walls, and fronting an inner  court of the castle, arose a tall, circular, heavy-buttressed tower,  considerably higher than the other buildings, and so mantled with a  dense growth of aged ivy as to stand a shaft of solid green. Above its  crumbling crown circled hundreds of pigeons, white and pied, clapping  and clattering in noisy flight through the sunny air. Several windows,  some closed with shutters, peeped here and there from out the leaves,  and near the top of the pile was a row of arched openings, as though of  a balcony or an airy gallery.    Myles had more than once felt an idle curiosity about this tower, and  one day, as he and Gascoyne sat together, he pointed his finger and  said, \"What is yon place?\"    \"That,\" answered Gascoyne, looking over his shoulder--\"that they call  Brutus Tower, for why they do say that Brutus he built it when he came  hither to Britain. I believe not the tale mine own self; ne'theless, it  is marvellous ancient, and old Robin-the-Fletcher telleth me that there  be stairways built in the wall and passage-ways, and a maze wherein  a body may get lost, an he know not the way aright, and never see the  blessed light of day again.\"    \"Marry,\" said Myles, \"those same be strange sayings. Who liveth there  now?\"    \"No one liveth there,\" said Gascoyne, \"saving only some of the stable  villains, and that half-witted goose-herd who flung stones at us  yesterday when we mocked him down in the paddock. He and his wife and  those others dwell in the vaults beneath, like rabbits in any warren. No  one else hath lived there since Earl Robert's day, which belike was  an hundred years agone. The story goeth that Earl Robert's brother--or  step-brother--was murdered there, and some men say by the Earl himself.  Sin that day it hath been tight shut.\"    Myles stared at the tower for a while in silence. \"It is a  strange-seeming place from without,\" said he, at last, \"and mayhap it  may be even more strange inside. Hast ever been within, Francis?\"    \"Nay,\" said Gascoyne; \"said I not it hath been fast locked since Earl  Robert's day?\"    \"By'r Lady,\" said Myles, \"an I had lived here in this place so long as  thou, I wot I would have been within it ere this.\"    \"Beshrew me,\" said Gascoyne, \"but I have never thought of such a  matter.\" He turned and looked at the tall crown rising into the warm  sunlight with a new interest, for the thought of entering it smacked  pleasantly of adventure. \"How wouldst thou set about getting within?\"  said he, presently.    \"Why, look,\" said Myles; \"seest thou not yon hole in the ivy branches?  Methinks there is a window at that place. An I mistake not, it is in  reach of the stable eaves. A body might come up by the fagot pile to the  roof of the hen-house, and then by the long stable to the north stable,  and so to that hole.\"    Gascoyne looked thoughtfully at the Brutus Tower, and then suddenly  inquired, \"Woulds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#9)"],[1," base at heart? It's  hideous. How little we know of men! I had my dream about Vaughn Steele.  I confess because it shames me--because I hate myself!\"    Next morning I awakened with a feeling that I was more like my old self.  In the experience of activity of body and mind, with a prospect that  this was merely the forerunner of great events, I came round to my own  again.    Sally was not forgotten; she had just become a sorrow. So perhaps my  downfall as a lover was a precursor of better results as an officer.    I held in abeyance my last conclusion regarding Sampson and Wright, and  only awaited Steele's return to have fixed in mind what these men were.    Wright's remark about Steele not returning did not worry me. I had heard  many such dark sayings in reference to Rangers.    Rangers had a trick of coming back. I did not see any man or men on the  present horizon of Linrock equal to the killing of Steele.    As Miss Sampson and Sally had no inclination to ride, I had even more  freedom. I went down to the town and burst, cheerily whistling, into Jim  Hoden's place.    Jim always made me welcome there, as much for my society as for the  money I spent, and I never neglected being free with both. I bought  a handful of cigars and shoved some of them in his pocket.    \"How's tricks, Jim?\" I asked cheerily.    \"Reckon I'm feelin' as well as could be expected,\" replied Jim. His head  was circled by a bandage that did not conceal the lump where he had been  struck. Jim looked a little pale, but he was bright enough.    \"That was a hell of a biff Snell gave you, the skunk,\" I remarked with  the same cheery assurance.    \"Russ, I ain't accusin' Snell,\" remonstrated Jim with eyes that made me  thoughtful.    \"Sure, I know you're too good a sport to send a fellow up. But Snell  deserved what he got. I saw his face when he made his talk to Sampson's  court. Snell lied. And I'll tell you what, Jim, if it'd been me instead  of that Ranger, Bud Snell would have got settled.\"    Jim appeared to be agitated by my forcible intimation of friendship.    \"Jim, that's between ourselves,\" I went on. \"I'm no fool. And much as I  blab when I'm hunky, it's all air. Maybe you've noticed that about me.  In some parts of Texas it's policy to be close-mouthed. Policy and  healthy. Between ourselves, as friends, I want you to know I lean some  on Steele's side of the fence.\"    As I lighted a cigar I saw, out of the corner of my eye, how Hoden gave  a quick start. I expected some kind of a startling idea to flash into  his mind.    Presently I turned and frankly met his gaze. I had startled him out of  his habitual set taciturnity, but even as I looked the light that might  have been amaze and joy faded out of his face, leaving it the same old  mask.    Still I had seen enough. Like a bloodhound, I had a scent. \"Thet's  funny, Russ, seein' as you drift with the gang Steele's bound to fight,\"  remarked Hoden.    \"Sure. I'm a sport. If I can't gamble with gentlemen I'll gamble with  rustlers.\"    Again he gave a slight start, and this time he hid his eyes.    \"Wal, Russ, I've heard you was slick,\" he said.    \"You tumble, Jim. I'm a little better on the draw.\"    \"On the draw? With cards, an' gun, too, eh?\"    \"Now, Jim, that last follows natural. I haven't had much chance to show  how good I am on the draw with a gun. But that'll come soon.\"    \"Reckon thet talk's a little air,\" said Hoden with his dry laugh. \"Same  as you leanin' a little on the Ranger's side of the fence.\"    \"But, Jim, wasn't he game? What'd you think of that stand? Bluffed the  whole gang! The way he called Sampson--why, it was great! The justice of  that call doesn't bother me. It was Steele's nerve that got me. That'd  warm any man's blood.\"    There was a little red in Hoden's pale cheeks and I saw him swallow  hard. I had struck deep again.    \"Say, don't you work for Sampson?\" he queried.    \"Me? I _guess_ not. I'm Miss Sampson's man. He and Wright have tried to  fire me many a time.\"    \"Thet so?\" he said curiously. \"What for?\"    \"Too many silver trimmings on me, Jim. And I pack my gun low down.\"    \"Wal, them two don't go much together out here,\" replied Hoden. \"But I  ain't seen thet anyone has shot off the trimmin's.\"    \"Maybe it'll commence, Jim, as soon as I stop buying drinks. Talking  about work--who'd you say Snell worked for?\"    \"I didn't say.\"    \"Well, say so now, can't you? Jim, you're powerful peevish to-day. It's  the bump on your head. Who does Snell work for?\"    \"When he works at all, which sure ain't often, he rides for Sampson.\"    \"Humph! Seems to me, Jim, that Sampson's the whole circus round Linrock.  I was some sore the other day to find I was losing good money at  Sampson's faro game. Sure if I'd won I wouldn't have been sorry, eh? But  I was surprised to hear some scully say Sampson owned the Hope So dive.\"    \"I've heard he owned considerable property hereabouts,\" replied Jim  constrainedly.    \"Humph again! Why, Jim, you _know_ it, only like every other scully you  meet in this town, you're afraid to open your mug about Sampson. Get me  straight, Jim Hoden. I don't care a damn for Colonel Mayor Sampson. And  for cause I'd throw a gun on him just as quick as on any rustler in  Pecos.\"    \"Talk's cheap, my boy,\" replied Hoden, making light of my bluster, but  the red was deep in his face.    \"Sure, I know that,\" I said, calming down. \"My temper gets up, Jim. Then  it's not well known that Sampson owns the Hope So?\"    \"Reckon it's known in Pecos, all right. But Sampson's name isn't  connected with the Hope So. Blandy runs the place.\"    \"That Blandy--I've got no use for him. His faro game's crooked, or I'm  locoed bronc. Not that we don't have lots of crooked faro dealers. A  fellow can stand for them. But Blandy's mean, back handed, never looks  you in the eyes. That Hope So place ought to be run by a good fellow  like you, Hoden.\"    \"Thanks, Russ,\" replied he, and I imagined his voice a little husky.  \"Didn't you ever hear _I_ used to run it?\"    \"No. Did you?\" I said quickly.    \"I reckon. I built the place, made additions twice, owned it for eleven  years.\"    \"Well, I'll be doggoned!\"    It was indeed my turn to be surprised, and with the surprise came  glimmering.    \"I'm sorry you're not there now, Jim. Did you sell out?\"    \"No. Just lost the place.\"    Hoden was bursting for relief now--to talk--to tell. Sympathy had made  him soft. I did not need to ask another question.    \"It was two years ago--two years last March,\" he went on. \"I was in a  big cattle deal with Sampson. We got the stock, an' my share, eighteen  hundred head, was rustled off. I owed Sampson. He pressed me. It come to  a lawsuit, an' I--was ruined.\"    It hurt me to look at Hoden. He was white, and tears rolled down his  cheeks.    I saw the bitterness, the defeat, the agony of the man. He had failed to  meet his obligation; nevertheless he had been swindled.    All that he suppressed, all that would have been passion had the man's  spirit not been broken, lay bare for me to see. I had now the secret of  his bitterness.    But the reason he did not openly accuse Sampson, the secret of his  reticence and fear--these I thought best to try to learn at some later  time, after I had consulted with Steele.    \"Hard luck! Jim, it certainly was tough,\" I said. \"But you're a good  loser. And the wheel turns!    \"Now, Jim, here's what I come particular to see you for. I need your  advice. I've got a little money. Between you and me, as friends, I've  been adding some to that roll all the time. But before I lose it I want  to invest some. Buy some stock or buy an interest in some rancher's  herd.    \"What I want you to steer me on is a good, square rancher. Or maybe a  couple of ranchers if there happen to be two honest ones in Pecos. Eh?  No deals with ranchers who ride in the dark with rustlers! I've a hunch  Linrock's full of them.    \"Now, Jim, you've been here for years. So you must know a couple of men  above suspicion.\"    \"Thank God I do, Russ,\" he replied feelingly. \"Frank Morton an' Si  Zimmer, my friends an' neighbors all my prosperous days. An' friends  still. You can gamble on Frank and Si. But Russ, if you want advice from  me, don't invest money in stock now.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because any new feller buyin' stock in Pecos these days will be  rustled quicker'n he can say Jack Robinson. The pioneers, the new  cattlemen--these are easy pickin'. But the new fellers have to learn the  ropes. They don't know anythin' or anybody. An' the old ranchers are  wise an' sore. They'd fight if they....\"    \"What?\" I put in as he paused. \"If they knew who was rustling the stock?\"    \"Nope.\"    \"If they had the nerve?\"    \"Not thet so much.\"    \"What then? What'd make them fight?\"    \"A leader!\"    I went out of Hoden's with that word ringing in my ears. A leader! In my  mind's eye I saw a horde of dark faced, dusty-booted cattlemen riding  grim and armed behind Vaughn Steele.    More thoughtful than usual, I walked on, passing some of my old haunts,  and was about to turn in front of a feed and grain store when a hearty  slap on my back disturbed my reflection.    \"Howdy thar, cowboy,\" boomed a big voice.    It was Morton, the rancher whom Jim had mentioned, and whose  acquaintance I had made. He was a man of great bulk, with a ruddy,  merry face.    \"Hello, Morton. Let's have a drink,\" I replied.    \"Gotta rustle home,\" he said. \"Young feller, I've a ranch to work.\"    \"Sell it to me, Morton.\"    He laughed and said he wished he could. His buckboard stood at the rail,  the horses stamping impatiently.    \"Cards must be runnin' lucky,\" he went on, with another hearty laugh.    \"Can't kick on the luck. But I'm afraid it will change. Morton, my  friend Hoden gave me a hunch you'd be a good man to tie to. Now, I've  a little money, and before I lose it I'd like to invest it in stock.\"    He smiled broadly, but for all his doubt of me he took definite  interest.    \"I'm"]]]
