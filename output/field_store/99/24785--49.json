The world of image and concept, the endless and  ever-shifting picture of objective reality, is the unavoidable  subject-matter of human communication, for it is only, or mainly, in  terms of this world that effective action is possible. Desire, purpose,  emotion are the personal color of the objective world; they are applied  privately by the individual soul and are of relatively little importance  to the neighboring one. All this does not mean that volition and emotion  are not expressed. They are, strictly speaking, never absent from normal  speech, but their expression is not of a truly linguistic nature. The  nuances of emphasis, tone, and phrasing, the varying speed and  continuity of utterance, the accompanying bodily movements, all these  express something of the inner life of impulse and feeling, but as these  means of expression are, at last analysis, but modified forms of the  instinctive utterance that man shares with the lower animals, they  cannot be considered as forming part of the essential cultural  conception of language, however much they may be inseparable from its  actual life. And this instinctive expression of volition and emotion is,  for the most part, sufficient, often more than sufficient, for the  purposes of communication.    There are, it is true, certain writers on the psychology of language[9]  who deny its prevailingly cognitive character but attempt, on the  contrary, to demonstrate the origin of most linguistic elements within  the domain of feeling. I confess that I am utterly unable to follow  them. What there is of truth in their contentions may be summed up, it  seems to me, by saying that most words, like practically all elements of  consciousness, have an associated feeling-tone, a mild, yet none the  less real and at times insidiously powerful, derivative of pleasure or  pain. This feeling-tone, however, is not as a rule an inherent value in  the word itself; it is rather a sentimental growth on the word's true  body, on its conceptual kernel. Not only may the feeling-tone change  from one age to another (this, of course, is true of the conceptual  content as well), but it varies remarkably from individual to individual  according to the personal associations of each, varies, indeed, from  time to time in a single individual's consciousness as his experiences  mold him and his moods change. To be sure, there are socially accepted  feeling-tones, or ranges of feeling-tone, for many words over and above  the force of individual association, but they are exceedingly variable  and elusive things at best. They rarely have the rigidity of the  central, primary fact. We all grant, for instance, that _storm_,  _tempest_, and _hurricane_, quite aside from their slight differences of  actual meaning, have distinct feeling-tones, tones that are felt by all  sensitive speakers and readers of English in a roughly equivalent  fashion. _Storm_, we feel, is a more general and a decidedly less  \"magnificent\" word than the other two; _tempest_ is not only associated  with the sea but is likely, in the minds of many, to have obtained a  softened glamour from a specific association with Shakespeare's great  play; _hurricane_ has a greater forthrightness, a directer ruthlessness  than its synonyms. Yet the individual's feeling-tones for these words  are likely to vary enormously. To some _tempest_ and _hurricane_ may  seem \"soft,\" literary words, the simpler _storm_ having a fresh, rugged  value which the others do not possess (think of _storm and stress_). If  we have browsed much in our childhood days in books of the Spanish Main,  _hurricane_ is likely to have a pleasurably bracing tone; if we have had  the misfortune to be caught in one, we are not unlikely to feel the word  as cold, cheerless, sinister.    [Footnote 9: E.g., the brilliant Dutch writer, Jac van Ginneken.]    The feeling-tones of words are of no use, strictly speaking, to science;  the philosopher, if he desires to arrive at truth rather than merely to  persuade, finds them his most insidious enemies. But man is rarely  engaged in pure science, in solid thinking. Generally his mental  activities are bathed in a warm current of feeling and he seizes upon  the feeling-tones of words as gentle aids to the desired excitation.  They are naturally of great value to the literary artist. It is  interesting to note, however, that even to the artist they are a danger.  A word whose customary feeling-tone is too unquestioningly accepted  becomes a plushy bit of furniture, a _cliche_. Every now and then the  artist has to fight the feeling-tone, to get the word to mean what it  nakedly and conceptually should mean, depending for the effect of  feeling on the creative power of an individual juxtaposition of concepts  or images.          III    THE SOUNDS OF LANGUAGE      We have seen that the mere phonetic framework of speech does not  constitute the inner fact of language and that the single sound of  articulated speech is not, as such, a linguistic element at all. For all  that, speech is so inevitably bound up with sounds and their  articulation that we can hardly avoid giving the subject of phonetics  some general consideration. Experience has shown that neither the purely  formal aspects of a language nor the course of its history can be fully  understood without reference to the sounds in which this form and this  history are embodied. A detailed survey of phonetics would be both too  technical for the general reader and too loosely related to our main  theme to warrant the needed space, but we can well afford to consider a  few outstanding facts and ideas connected with the sounds of language.    The feeling that the average speaker has of his language is that it is  built up, acoustically speaking, of a comparatively small number of  distinct sounds, each of which is rather accurately provided for in the  current alphabet by one letter or, in a few cases, by two or more  alternative letters. As for the languages of foreigners, he generally  feels that, aside from a few striking differences that cannot escape  even the uncritical ear, the sounds they use are the same as those he is  familiar with but that there is a mysterious \"accent\" to these foreign  languages, a certain unanalyzed phonetic character, apart from the  sounds as such, that gives them their air of strangeness. This naive  feeling is largely illusory on both scores. Phonetic analysis convinces  one that the number of clearly distinguishable sounds and nuances of  sounds that are habitually employed by the speakers of a language is far  greater than they themselves recognize. Probably not one English speaker  out of a hundred has the remotest idea that the _t_ of a word like  _sting_ is not at all the same sound as the _t_ of _teem_, the latter  _t_ having a fullness of \"breath release\" that is inhibited in the  former case by the preceding _s_; that the _ea_ of _meat_ is of  perceptibly shorter duration than the _ea_ of _mead_; or that the final  _s_ of a word like _heads_ is not the full, buzzing _z_ sound of the _s_  in such a word as _please_. It is the frequent failure of foreigners,  who have acquired a practical mastery of English and who have eliminated  all the cruder phonetic shortcomings of their less careful brethren, to  observe such minor distinctions that helps to give their English  pronunciation the curiously elusive \"accent\" that we all vaguely feel.  We do not diagnose the \"accent\" as the total acoustic effect produced by  a series of slight but specific phonetic errors for the very good reason  that we have never made clear to ourselves our own phonetic stock in  trade. If two languages taken at random, say English and Russian, are  compared as to their phonetic systems, we are more apt than not to find  that very few of the phonetic elements of the one find an exact analogue  in the other. Thus, the _t_ of a Russian word like _tam_ \"there\" is  neither the English _t_ of _sting_ nor the English _t_ of _teem_. It  differs from both in its \"dental\" articulation, in other words, in being  produced by contact of the tip of the tongue with the upper teeth, not,  as in English, by contact of the tongue back of the tip with the gum  ridge above the teeth; moreover, it differs from the _t_ of _teem_ also  in the absence of a marked \"breath release\" before the following vowel  is attached, so that its acoustic effect is of a more precise,  \"metallic\" nature than in English. Again, the English _l_ is unknown in  Russian, which possesses, on the other hand, two distinct _l_-sounds  that the normal English speaker would find it difficult exactly to  reproduce--a \"hollow,\" guttural-like _l_ and a \"soft,\" palatalized  _l_-sound that is only very approximately rendered, in English terms, as  _ly_. Even so simple and, one would imagine, so invariable a sound as  _m_ differs in the two languages. In a Russian word like _most_ \"bridge\"  the _m_ is not the same as the _m_ of the English word _most_; the lips  are more fully rounded during its articulation, so that it makes a  heavier, more resonant impression on the ear. The vowels, needless to  say, differ completely in English and Russian, hardly any two of them  being quite the same.    I have gone into these illustrative details, which are of little or no  specific interest for us, merely in order to provide something of an  experimental basis to convince ourselves of the tremendous variability  of speech sounds. Yet a complete inventory of the acoustic resources of  all the European languages, the languages nearer home, while  unexpectedly large, would still fall far short of conveying a just idea  of the true range of human articulation. In many of the languages of  Asia, Africa, and aboriginal America there are whole classes of sounds  that most of us have no knowledge of. They are not necessarily more  difficult of enunciation than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12630"],[0,"The Adventures of Old Mr. Toad (#9)"],[1,"everything but the need of getting out of sight of Mr. Blacksnake  as soon as ever he could. So away went Old Mr. Toad, hop, hop,  hipperty-hop, hop, hop, hipperty-hop! He heard Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk  and Johnny Chuck and others of his old friends and neighbors shouting with  laughter. Yes, and he heard the deep, grumbly-rumbly laugh of Buster Bear.  But he didn't mind it. Not then, anyway. He hadn't room for any feeling  except fear of Mr. Blacksnake.    But Old Mr. Toad had to stop after a while. You see, his legs were so tired  they just wouldn't go any longer. And he was so out of breath that he  wheezed. He crawled under a big piece of bark, and there he lay flat on the  ground and panted and panted for breath. He would stay there until jolly,  round, bright Mr. Sun went to bed behind the Purple Hills. Then Mr.  Blacksnake would go to bed too, and it would be safe for him to go home.  Now, lying there in the dark, for it was dark under that big piece of bark,  Old Mr. Toad had time to think. Little by little he began to understand  that his invitation to dine with Buster Bear had been part of a plan by his  old friends and neighbors whom he had so snubbed and looked down on when he  had been puffed up with pride, to teach him a lesson. At first he was  angry, very angry indeed. Then he began to see how foolish and silly he had  been, and shame took the place of anger. As he remembered the deep,  grumbly-rumbly laughter of Buster Bear, the feeling of shame grew.    \"I deserve it,\" thought Old Mr. Toad. \"Yes, Sir, I deserve every bit of it.  The only thing that I have to be proud of is that I'm honest and work for  my living. Yes, Sir, that's all.\"    When darkness came at last, and he crawled out to go home, he was feeling  very humble. Peter Rabbit happened along just then. Old Mr. Toad opened his  mouth to speak, but Peter suddenly threw his head up very high and strutted  past as if he didn't see Old Mr. Toad at all. Mr. Toad gulped and went on.  Pretty soon he met Jimmy Skunk. Jimmy went right on about his business and  actually stepped right over Old Mr. Toad as if he had been a stick or a  stone. Old Mr. Toad gulped again and went on. The next day he went down to  see Danny Meadow Mouse. He meant to tell Danny how ashamed he was for the  way he had treated Danny and his other friends. But Danny brushed right  past without even a glance at him. Old Mr. Toad gulped and started up to  see Johnny Chuck. The same thing happened again. So it did when he met  Striped Chipmunk.    At last Old Mr. Toad gave up and went home, where he sat under a big  mullein leaf the rest of the day, feeling very miserable and lonely. He  didn't have appetite enough to snap at a single fly. Late that afternoon he  heard a little noise and looked up to find all his old friends and  neighbors forming a circle around him. Suddenly they began to dance and  shout:      \"Old Mr. Toad is a jolly good fellow!    His temper is sweet, disposition is mellow!    And now that his bubble of pride is quite busted    We know that he knows that his friends can be trusted.\"    Then Old Mr. Toad knew that all was well once more, and presently he began  to dance too, the funniest dance that ever was seen.    This is all for now about homely Old Mr. Toad, because I have just got to  tell you about another homely fellow,--Prickly Porky the Porcupine,--who  carries a thousand little spears. The next book will tell you all about  _his_ adventures."]]]
