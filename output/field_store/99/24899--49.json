'Therefore,' said Tom, 'beware of the first drink!'  9. \"It was not long before he began to follow his old habit.  He knew the danger, but it seemed as if he could not resist  his desire to drink. His poor mother soon died of grief and  shame. His lovely wife followed her to the grave.  10. \"He lost the respect of all, went on from bad to worse,  and has long been a perfect sot. Last night, I had a letter  from the city, stating that Tom Smith had been found guilty  of stealing, and sent to the state prison for ten years.  11. \"There I suppose he will die, for he is now old. It is  dreadful to think to what an end he has come.

Speak gently; it is better far  To rule by love than fear:  Speak gently; let no harsh words mar  The good we might do here.    2. Speak gently to the little child;  Its love be sure to gain;  Teach it in accents soft and mild;  It may not long remain.    3. Speak gently to the aged one;  Grieve not the careworn heart:  The sands of life are nearly run;  Let such in peace depart.    4. Speak gently, kindly, to the poor;  Let no harsh tone be heard;  They have enough they must endure,  Without an unkind word.    5. Speak gently to the erring; know  They must have toiled in vain;  Perhaps unkindness made them so;  Oh, win them back again.     THIRD READER.  115    6. Speak gently: 'tis a little thing  Dropped in the heart's deep well;  The good, the joy, which it may bring,  Eternity shall tell.  George Washington Langford.          LESSON XLIV.    THE SEVEN STICKS.  1. A man had seven sons, who were always quarreling.  They left their studies and work, to quarrel among  themselves. Some bad men were looking forward to the  death of their father, to cheat them out of their property by  making them quarrel about it.  2. The good old man, one day, called his sons around him.  He laid before them seven sticks, which were bound  together. He said, \"I will pay a hundred dollars to the one  who can break this bundle.\"  3. Each one strained every nerve to break the bundle.  After a long but vain trial, they all said that it could not be  done.     116  ECLECTIC SERIES.  4. \"And yet, my boys,\" said the father, \"nothing is easier  to do.\" He then untied the bundle, and broke the sticks, one  by one, with perfect ease.    5. \"Ah!\" said his sons, \"it is easy enough to do it so;  anybody could do it in that way.\"  6. Their father replied, \"As it is with these sticks, so is it  with you, my sons. So     THIRD READER.  117  long as you hold fast together and aid each other, you will  prosper, and none can injure you.  7. \"But if the bond of union be broken, it will happen to  you just as it has to these sticks, which lie here broken on the  ground.\"    Home, city, country, all are prosperous found,  When by the powerful link of union bound.        LESSON XLV.  THE MOUNTAIN SISTER.  1. The home of little Jeannette is far away, high up among  the mountains. Let us call her our mountain sister.  2. There are many things you would like to hear about her,  but I can only tell you now how she goes with her father and  brother, in the autumn, to help gather nuts for the long  winter.     118  ECLECTIC SERIES.  3. A little way down the mountain side is a chestnut wood.  Did you ever see a chestnut tree? In the spring its branches  are covered with bunches of  creamy flowers, like long  tassels. All the hot summer these are turning into sweet nuts,  wrapped safely in large, prickly, green balls.  4. But when the frost of autumn comes, these prickly balls  turn brown, and crack open. Then you may see inside one,  two, three, and even four, sweet, brown nuts.  5. When her father says, one night at supper time, \"I think  there will be a frost tonight,\" Jeannette knows very well what  to do. She dances away early in the evening to her little bed,  made in a box built up against the wall.  6. Soon she falls asleep to dream about       THIRD READER.  119  the chestnut wood, and the little brook that springs from rock  to rock down under the tall, dark trees. She wakes with the  first daylight, and is out of bed in a minute, when she hears  her father's cheerful call, \"Come, children; it is time to be  off.\"  7. Their dinner is ready in a large basket. The donkey  stands before the door with great bags for the nuts hanging at  each side. They go merrily over the crisp, white frost to the  chestnut trees. How the frost has opened the burs! It has  done half their work for them already.  8. How they laugh and sing, and shout to each other as  they fill their baskets! The sun looks down through the  yellow leaves; the rocks give them mossy seats; the birds  and squirrels wonder what these strange people are doing in  their woods.  9. Jeannette really helps, though she is only a little girl;  and her father says at night, that his Jane is a dear, good  child. This makes her very happy. She thinks about it at  night, when she says her prayers. Then she goes to sleep to  dream of the merry autumn days.  10. Such is our little mountain sister, and     120  ECLECTIC SERIES.      here is a picture of her far-away home. The mountain life is  ever a fresh and happy one.         THIRD READER.  121    LESSON XLVI.    HARRY AND THE GUIDEPOST.    1. The night was dark, the sun was hid  Beneath the mountain gray,  And not a single star appeared  To shoot a silver ray.    2. Across the heath the owlet flew,  And screamed along the blast;  And onward, with a quickened step,  Benighted Harry passed.    3. Now, in thickest darkness plunged,  He groped his way to find;  And now, he thought he saw beyond,  A form of horrid kind.    4. In deadly white it upward rose,  Of cloak and mantle bare,  And held its naked arms across,  To catch him by the hair.    5. Poor Harry felt his blood run cold,  At what before him stood;  But then, thought he, no harm, I'm sure,  Can happen to the good.     122  ECLECTIC SERIES.    6. So, calling all his courage up,  He to the monster went;  And eager through the dismal gloom  His piercing eyes he bent.    7. And when he came well nigh the ghost  That gave him such affright,  He clapped his hands upon his side,  And loudly laughed outright.    8. For 't was a friendly guidepost stood,  His wandering steps to guide;  And thus he found that to the good,  No evil could betide.         THIRD READER.  123    9.   Ah well, thought he, one thing I've learned,  Nor shall I soon forget;  Whatever frightens me again,  I'll march straight up to it.    10. And when I hear an idle tale,  Of monster or of ghost,  I'll tell of this, my lonely walk,  And one tall, white guidepost.          LESSON XLVII.    THE MONEY AMY DID N'T EARN.    1. Amy was a dear little girl, but she was too apt to waste  time in getting ready to do her tasks, instead of doing them at  once as she ought.     124  ECLECTIC SERIES.  2. In the village in which she lived, Mr. Thornton kept a  store where he sold fruit of all kinds, including berries in  their season. One day he said to Amy, whose parents were  quite poor, \"Would you like to earn some money? \"  3. \"Oh, yes,\" replied she, \"for I want some new shoes, and  papa has no money to buy them with.\"  4. \"Well, Amy,\" said Mr. Thorhton, \"I noticed some fine,  ripe blackberries in Mr. Green's pasture to-day, and he said  that anybody was welcome to them. I will pay you thirteen  cents a quart for all you will pick for me.\"  5. Amy was delighted at the thought of earning some  money; so she ran home to get a basket, intending to go  immediately to pick the berries.  6. Then she thought she would like to know how much  money she would get if she picked five quarts. With the help  of her slate and pencil, she found out that she would get  sixty-five cents.  7. \"But supposing I should pick a dozen quarts,\" thought  she, \"how much should I earn then?\" \"Dear me,\" she said,  after     THIRD READER.  125  figuring a while, \"I should earn a dollar and fifty-six cents.\"  8. Amy then found out what Mr. Thornton would pay her  for fifty, a hundred, and two hundred quarts. It took her some  time to    do this, and then it was so near dinner time that she had to  stay at home until afternoon.  9. As soon as dinner was over, she took     126  ECLECTIC SERIES,  her basket and hurried to the pasture. Some boys had been  there before dinner, and all the ripe berries were picked. She  could not find enough to fill a quart measure.  10. As Amy went home, she thought of what her teacher  had often told her--\"Do your task at once; then think about  it,\" for \"one doer is worth a hundred dreamers.\"        LESSON XLVIII.  WHO MADE THE STARS?    1. \"Mother, who made the stars, which light  The beautiful blue sky?  Who made the moon, so clear and bright,  That rises up so high?\"    2. \"'T was God, my child, the Glorious One,  He formed them by his power;  He made alike the brilliant sun,  And every leaf and flower.     THIRD  READER.  127    3. \"He made your little feet to walk;  Your sparkling eyes to see;  Your busy, prattling tongue to talk,  And limbs so light and free.    4. \"He paints each fragrant flower that blows,  With loveliness and bloom;  He gives the violet and the rose  Their beauty and perfume.    5. \"Our various wants his hands supply;  He guides us every hour;  We're kept beneath his watchful eye,  And guarded by his power.    6. \"Then let your little heart, my love,  Its grateful homage pay  To that kind Friend, who, from above,  Thus guides you every day.    7. \"In all the changing scenes of time,  On Him our hopes depend;  In every age,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14772"],[0,"Acton's Feud: A Public School Story (#9)"],[1,"ur. \"I'm an  ass,\" he said to himself; \"but, anyhow, I'll look up what the blessed word  does mean, and try to do it.\"    \"I see,\" said Grim, \"they've got a poem on 'Cock House' for number two.  That seems all right, eh?\"    \"Oh yes; it's always done.\"    \"Well, we'll have one too, eh? Who's got to do the poetry, though?  Somebody propose somebody\"--thereupon every fag proposed his chiefest  enemy, and the battles raged along the line. \"And you call yourselves  gentlemen!\" said Grim in disgust--he had been overlooked for the time  being.    \"I propose Sharpe,\" said Wilson, dusting himself. \"He does no end swell  construes from 'Ovid.'\"    \"I second that,\" said Rogers. \"He has long hair. Poets always have. Milton  had.\"    \"That bit is _side,_\" said the chairman, judicially. \"Those who are  in favour of Sharpe doing the poetry hold--Carried, _nem. con._\"    \"_Nem. con_. is side too, Grim,\" said Rogers.    \"Shut up, you mule! Sharpe, you'll have to do the poem.\"    \"I say, you fellows, it will be horse work,\" said Sharpe, disconsolately.  \"There isn't a rhyme to Biffen's.\"    \"Oh! isn't there? What about 'spiffing'?\"    Sharpe choked.    \"Griffin.\"    \"Tiffin.\"    Lamb squeaked out \"stiff 'un,\" and some one gently led him out--even  Biffen's fags caved in at that.    \"Sharpe, you're booked for number two, old man. Gentlemen, I direct your  attention to number three--Corker's did Indian clubs and the gold-fish  dodge.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Wilson, \"we're not going to copy Corker's, anyhow. Let's  do dumb-bells and something else.\"    \"I propose that Wilson does the something else,\" said Cherry,  good-naturedly.    Wilson said he was ready to do something to Cherry any time that was  convenient. Rogers suggested that they ask the niggers to do something on  the bars, and Sharpe seconded it, so the dervishes were written to and  promised a scragging if they didn't turn themselves inside out for the  glory of Biffen's concert.    \"I say, you fellows,\" said Grim, \"it's to be a concert, you know, and  except for Fruity's epilogue there isn't any music down yet.\" Cherry  groaned to think he'd been let in for a song.    \"What about Thurston?\" asked half a dozen of the fags.    \"Right, oh! Now, 'Dicky Bird,' hop up to the front, and trot out your  list.\"    Thurston wasn't shy, and rather fancied his bleat, so he said, \"Oh! I  don't mind at all.\"    \"We thought you wouldn't,\" said the chairman, winking.    \"What do you say to 'Alice, where art thou'?\"    \"We don't fancy your shouting five minutes for her at all. Next, please.\"    \"'Only to see her face again,' then?\"    \"Whose?\" said Sharpe, irreverently.    \"Why, the girl's the fellow is singing about,\" said Thurston, hotly.    \"Oh! you'll see her the day after to-morrow, Dicky Bird, so don't you fret  about that now. Do you know 'My first cigar'?\"    \"Do you mean the one that sent you to hospital, Grimmy?\"    \"No I don't. None of your cheek. I'm chairman. I mean the one Corney Grain  used to sing.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, you sing that and you'll make the fellows die with laughing. And  mind you illustrate it with plenty of life-like pantomime, do you hear?\"    \"Carried, _nem. con_.,\" shouted all the fags with enthusiasm.    \"Hear, hear, Grimmy!\"    \"So that's settled for you, and if you get an encore, Dicky Bird, you can  trot 'Alice' out if you like.\"    \"Which of the fellows have we to invite out of the eleven to help us?\"    \"Acton,\" was the universal yell.    \"We'll see him, then, to-night.\"    \"Three cheers for Acton,\" said someone, and the roof echoed.    \"Well, we're getting on, and I say, you chaps, I have an idea.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" said Cherry, acidly; \"Grimmy _has_ an idea.\"    \"A grand idea, Fruity. Your epilogue isn't in it.\"    \"What is it, Grim?\"    \"We'll have a boxing competition open to St. Amory's juniors only. Rogers  should pull that off, eh?\"    \"Rather,\" said they all. \"One more feather in Biffen's cap.\".    \"But, Grimmy,\" said Rogers, \"I don't last, you know.\"    \"Ah!\" said the chairman, brilliantly, \"we'll only have one two-minutes'  round each draw. It will go by points. You're safe as a house, my pet,  really.\"    \"Who'll be judge about points? I propose you, Grim,\" said Rogers, with  intent.    \"Thanks, old cock, but I really couldn't do the honourable if you were  'rocky' in the last rounds. We'll ask Carr to see us through that part.  You'll be all right, I tell you.\"    \"Who's to accompany on the P and O?\"    \"Oh, Brown must see to that!\"    \"I propose Brown key-thumper.\"    \"I second that.\"    \"Carried,\" said the chair, smartly.    \"I say,\" said Grim, \"I propose myself stage manager. I'm the only fellow  who knows a ha'porth about it.\"    \"A ha'porth is an awful lot; besides, a chairman can't propose himself,\"  said Cherry, revengefully.    \"I second the chairman's proposal,\" said Wilson, backing up his chum.    \"Carried, _nem. con_.\"    \"No, I'm hanged if it was!\" said Cherry. \"You're a fraud, Grimmy.\"    \"All right now, you chaps, the meeting is over. Wilson and I will go up to  Acton, and see what he'll do for us, and then we'll rough out a swagger  programme.\"        CHAPTER IX    THE END OF TERM      The two worthies, Grim and Wilson, after seeing Acton, began to get out  their programme. Here it is:--           BIFFEN'S JUNIORS' CONCERT.         _Cock House, December, 1898._         (1) Epilogue.            B.A.M. CHERRY.         (2) Poem on the subject of Cock House.            B. SHARPE.         (3) Bar Act.         (4) First Round Junior Boxing Competition.            PRINCE RUNJIT MEHTAH and RAM SINGH.         (5) SONG. \"My First Cigar.\"            R.E. THURSTON.         (6) PIANOFORTE SOLO. \"Oh! listen to the band.\"            O. BROWN.         (7) Second Round Boxing.         (8) SONG. \"Jim.\"            J. ACTON, ESQ.         (9) Third and Concluding Rounds Boxing.         (10) SONG. \"Well, suppose you did?\"            R.E. THURSTON.              GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.         ACCOMPANIST           O.E. BROWN.       _Trinity College (by Examination)._         STAGE MANAGER         W.E. GRIM.         N.B.--The Manager begs to state that there will be no Latin       or classical allusions throughout the evening. No waits. No       charge for programmes. No antediluvian jokes.      This was printed on paper blushing pink--Biffen's colours--and Grim and  Wilson, when they got the advance proof last thing on Saturday night,  almost embraced in their jubilation. There was such a swagger look about  the \"N.B.\"    Meanwhile B.A.M. Cherry had consulted his dictionary, and therein found  that an \"epilogue\" was defined as \"a concluding speech in an oration or  play.\" He broke into a cold sweat of horror. That was an epilogue, then!  Where could he find one? What would be the good of one if he did find it?  And supposing he had one and could recite it, it was at the wrong end of  the programme--the programme which had already been printed in such hot  haste? It was too late to tell Grim, who would have instantly summoned all  the strength of Biffen's to scrag him. The wretched Cherry shuddered at  his awful plight.    Nothing could he do or dare he do. In desperation he determined to fall  ill on the concert night. B.A.M. Cherry hadn't the heroic soul, and when  Grim asked him cheerfully how the epilogue was going on, he said  \"spiffing,\" in the tone of a martyr at the stake.    On the Monday Grim scuttled about all day--now on the stage, listening to  Thurston going over his songs with Brown, now getting entries for his  boxing competition, now encouraging Sharpe, who was in the throes of  composition, and now criticizing the Dervishes with much force. Acton put  in an appearance in the concert-room, and gave Brown the accompaniment to  \"Jim;\" and, after hearing him play it through, went and read his novel the  rest of his spare time.    At 7.30 the juniors of St. Amory's began to stroll in, Biffen's lot  collaring the front seats as per custom. The programmes were distributed  to each one as he came in, and created no end of sensation, and W.E. Grim  was allowed to have come out very strong in the programme line. St.  Amory's fags did not spot anything wrong about item one, but the older  fellows chuckled a little and said \"the manager was a funny ass.\" This  opinion was instantly conveyed to Grim by one of his cronies, and made  that young gentleman think himself no end of a sly dog.    Punctually to the minute Grim rang his bell, and, darting into the  dressing-room, said, \"Now, Cherry, come along with your epilogue, They're  all waiting. Where is that ass?\"    \"Cherry has not turned up yet, Grim.\"    \"What?\" he said in horror.    \"Not turned up yet!\"    \"I'll go and fetch the beggar at once.\"    Grim darted out of the room, tore along the street, and was hammering at  Cherry's door within the minute.    \"Fruity, hurry up, they're all waiting.\"    \"I'm not well, Grim.\"    \"What?\"    \"I'm not well--I'm in bed.\"    \"You miserable beast!\" shouted Grim. \"I'll massacre you. You'll make us  the laughing stock of the whole school. Get up, man, Be a man.\"    \"I'm ill,\" moaned Cherry from within.    \"You miserable beast! You'll be dead to-morrow.\" He shook the door  violently, but Cherry was not quite the utter fool Grim took him for, for  he had locked the door. Grim stood outside on the corridor for some  seconds, petrified with rage and disgust, and then flew like a madman back  to the concert-room. He cannoned up against some one leisurely strolling  up to the dressing-room, and was darting on again _sans_ apology. A  hand gently closed upon his collar and pulled him back.    \"Hallo, young shaver! Little boys used to apologize when they--Why,  it's Grim! What in the name----\"    Grim, almost blubbing with anger and shame, poured out his tale, and Acton  listened with an amused smile. \"Sheer funk, Grim. Well, go on, and tell  'em their Cherry has rotted, but that I'll come and tell 'em a little tale  instead.\"    Grim would have embraced Acton"]]]
