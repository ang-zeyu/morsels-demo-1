This can be clearly seen from the  experiences before naval courts, where it is usual to demonstrate  collisions of ships by small ship models on the table in the  courtroom. Experience has frequently shown that helmsmen, who have  found their course a life long among real vessels in the harbor and on  the sea, become entirely confused when they are to demonstrate by the  models the relative positions of the ships. Even in the naval war  schools where the officers play at war with small model ships, a  certain inner readjustment is always necessary for them to bring the  miniature ships on the large table into the tactical game. On the  water, for instance, the navy officer sees the far-distant ships very  much smaller than those near by, while on the naval game table all the  ships look equally large. On the whole, I feel inclined to say from my  experience so far that experiments with small models of the actual  industrial mechanism are hardly appropriate for investigations in the  field of economic psychology. The essential point for the  psychological experiment is not the external similarity of the  apparatus, but exclusively the inner similarity of the mental  attitude. The more the external mechanism with which or on which the  action is carried out becomes schematized, the more the action itself  will appear in its true character.    In the method of my experiments with the motormen, accordingly, I had  to satisfy only two demands. The method of examination promised to be  valuable if, first, it showed good results with reliable motormen and  bad results with unreliable ones; and secondly, if it vividly aroused  in all the motormen the feeling that the mental function which they  were going through during the experiment had the greatest possible  similarity with their experience on the front platform of the  electric car. These are the true tests of a desirable experimental  method, while it is not necessary that the apparatus be similar to the  electric car or that the external activities in the experiment be  identical with their performance in the service. After several  unsatisfactory efforts, in which I worked with too complicated  instruments, I finally settled on the following arrangement of the  experiment which seems to me to satisfy those two demands.    The street is represented by a card 9 half-inches broad and 26  half-inches long. Two heavy lines half an inch apart go lengthwise  through the centre of the card, and accordingly a space of 4  half-inches remains on either side. The whole card is divided into  small half-inch squares which we consider as the unit. Thus there is  in any cross-section 1 unit between the two central lines and 4 units  on either side. Lengthwise there are 26 units. The 26 squares which  lie between the two heavy central lines are marked with the printed  letters of the alphabet from A to Z. These two heavy central lines are  to represent an electric railway track on a street. On either side the  4 rows of squares are filled in an irregular way with black and red  figures of the three first digits. The digit 1 always represents a  pedestrian who moves just one step, and that means from one unit into  the next; the digit 2 a horse, which moves twice as fast, that is,  which moves 2 units; and the digit 3 an automobile which moves three  times as fast, that is, 3 units. Moreover, the black digits stand for  men, horses, and automobiles which move parallel to the track and  cannot cross the track, and are therefore to be disregarded in looking  out for dangers. The red digits, on the other hand, are the dangerous  ones. They move from either side toward the track. The idea is that  the man to be experimented on is to find as quickly as possible those  points on the track which are threatened by the red figures, that is,  those letters in the 26 track units at which the red figures would  land, if they make the steps which their number indicates. A red digit  3 which is 4 steps from the track is to be disregarded, because it  would not reach the track. A red digit 3 which is only 1 or 2 steps  from the track is also to be disregarded, because it would cross  beyond the track, if it took 3 steps. But a red 3 which is 3 units  from the track, a red 2 which is 2 units from the track, and a red 1  which is 1 unit from the track would land on the track itself; and the  aim is quickly to find these points. The task is difficult, as the  many black figures divert the attention, and as the red figures too  near or too far are easily confused with those which are just at the  dangerous distance.    As soon as this principle for the experiment was recognized as  satisfactory, it was necessary to find a technical device by which a  movement over this artificial track could be produced in such a way  that the rapidity could be controlled by the subject of the experiment  and at the same time measured. Again we had to try various forms of  apparatus. Finally we found the following form most satisfactory.  Twelve such cards, each provided with a handle, lie one above another  under a glass plate through which the upper card can be seen. If this  highest card is withdrawn; the second is exposed, and from below  springs press the remaining cards against the glass plate. The glass  plate with the 12 cards below lies in a black wooden box and is  completely covered by a belt 8 inches broad, made of heavy black  velvet. This velvet belt moves over two cylinders at the front and the  rear ends of the apparatus. In the centre of the belt is a window  4-1/2 inches wide and 2-1/2 inches high. If the front cylinder is  turned by a metal crank, the velvet belt passes over the glass plate  and the little window opening moves over the card with its track and  figures. The whole breadth of the card, with its central track and its  4 units on either side, is visible through it over an area of 5 units  in the length direction. If the man to be experimented on turns the  crank with his right hand, the window slips over the whole length of  the card, one part of the card after another becomes visible, and then  he simply has to call the letters of those units in the track at which  the red figures on either side would land, if they took the number of  steps indicated by the digit. At the moment the window has reached Z  on the card, the experimenter withdraws that card and the next becomes  visible, as a second window in the belt appears at the lower end when  the first disappears at the upper end. In this way the subject can  turn his crank uninterruptedly until he has gone through the 12 cards.  The experimenter notes down the numbers of the cards and the letters  which the subject calls. Besides this, the number of seconds required  for the whole experiment, from the beginning of the first card to the  end of the twelfth, is measured with a stopwatch. This time is, of  course, dependent upon the rapidity with which the crank is turned.  The result of the experiment is accordingly expressed by three  figures, the number of seconds, the number of omissions, that is, of  places at which red figures would land on the track which were not  noticed by the subject; and, thirdly, the number of incorrect places  where letters were called in spite of the fact, that no danger  existed. In using the results, we may disregard this third figure and  give our attention to the speed and the number of omissions.    The necessary condition for carrying out the experiments with this  apparatus is a careful, quiet, practical explanation of the device.  The experiment must not under any circumstances be started until the  subject completely understands what he has to do and for what he has  to look out. For this purpose I at first always show the man one card  outside of the apparatus and explain to him the differences between  the black and the red figures, and the counting of the steps, and show  to him in a number of cases how some red figures do not reach the  track, how others go beyond the track, and how some just land in  danger on the track. As soon as he has completely understood the  principle, we turn to the apparatus and he moves the window slowly  over a test card, and tries to find the dangerous spots, and I turn  his attention to every case in which he has omitted one or has given  an incorrect letter. We repeat this slowly until he completely masters  the rules of the game. Only then is he allowed to start the  experiment. I have never found a man with whom this preparation takes  more than a few minutes.    After developing this method in the psychological laboratory, I  turned to the study of men actually in the service of a great electric  railway company which supported my endeavors in the most cordial  spirit. In accordance with my request, the company furnished me with a  number of the best motormen in its service, men who for twenty years  and more had performed their duties practically without accidents,  and, on the other hand, with a large number of motormen who had only  just escaped dismissal and whose record was characterized by many more  or less important collisions or other accidents. Finally, we had men  whose activity as motormen was neither especially good nor especially  bad.    The test of the method lies first in the fact that the tried motormen  agreed that they really pass through the experiment with the feeling  which they have on their car. The necessity of looking out in both  directions, right and left, for possible obstacles, of distinguishing  those which move toward the track from the many which move along the  track, the quick discrimination among the various rates of rapidity,  the steady forward movement of the observation point, the constant  temptation to give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#9)"],[1,"said, and began to take up the anchor. The queen went  up into the boat in great haste; and the moment she was on board the  boat started, and falling into the current passed on swiftly like an  arrow. The boat went on and on till it reached the sea. After it had  gone many furlongs into the open sea, the boat came near a whirlpool  where the prince saw a great many rubies of monstrous size floating on  the waters. Such large rubies no one had ever seen, each being in value  equal to the wealth of seven kings. The prince caught hold of  half-a-dozen of those rubies, and put them on board. His mother said,  \"Darling, don't take up those red balls; they must belong to somebody  who has been shipwrecked, and we may be taken up as thieves.\" At the  repeated entreaties of his mother, the prince threw them into the sea,  keeping only one tied up in his clothes. The boat then drifted toward  the coast, and the queen and the prince arrived at a certain port where  they landed.    The port where they landed was not a small place; it was a large city,  the capital of a great king. Not far from the palace, the queen and her  son hired a hut where they lived. As the prince was yet a boy, he was  fond of playing at marbles. When the children of the king came out to  play on a lawn before the palace, our young prince joined them. He had  no marbles, but he played with the ruby which he had in his possession.  The ruby was so hard that it broke every taw against which it struck.  The daughter of the king, who used to watch the games from a balcony of  the palace, was astonished to see a brilliant red ball in the hand of  the strange lad, and wanted to take possession of it. She told her  father that a boy of the street had an uncommonly bright stone in his  possession which she must have or else she would starve herself to  death. The king ordered his servants to bring to him the lad with that  precious stone. When the boy was brought, the king wondered at the  largeness and brilliancy of the ruby. He had never seen anything like  it. He doubted whether any king of any country in the world possessed so  great a treasure. He asked the lad where he had got it. The lad replied  that he got it from the sea. The king offered a thousand rupees for the  ruby, and the lad, not knowing its value, readily parted with it for  that sum. He went with the money to his mother, who was not a little  frightened, thinking that her son had stolen the money from some rich  man's house. She became quiet, however, on being assured that the money  was given to him by the king in exchange for the red ball which he had  picked up in the sea.    The king's daughter, on getting the ruby put it in her hair, and,  standing before her pet parrot, said to the bird, \"Oh, my darling  parrot, don't I look very beautiful with this ruby in my hair?\" The  parrot replied, \"Beautiful! you look quite hideous with it! What  princess ever puts only one ruby in her hair? It would be somewhat  feasible if you had two at least.\" Stung with shame at the reproach cast  in her teeth by the parrot, the princess went into the grief-chamber of  the palace, and would neither eat nor drink. The king was not a little  concerned when he heard that his daughter had gone into the  grief-chamber. He went to her, and asked her the cause of her grief. The  princess told the king what her pet parrot had said, and added, \"Father,  if you do not procure for me another ruby like this, I'll put an end to  my life by mine own hands.\" The king was overwhelmed with grief. Where  was he to get another ruby like it? He doubted whether another like it  could be found in the whole world. He ordered the lad who had sold the  ruby, to be brought into his presence. \"Have you, young man,\" asked the  king, \"another ruby like the one you sold me?\" The lad replied: \"No, I  have not got one. Why, do you want another? I can give you lots, if you  wish to have them. They are to be found in a whirlpool in the sea, far,  far away. I can go and fetch some for you.\" Amazed at the lad's reply,  the king offered rich rewards for procuring only another ruby of the  same sort.    The lad went home and said to his mother that he must go to sea again to  fetch some rubies for the king. The woman was quite frightened at the  idea, and begged him not to go. But the lad was resolved on going, and  nothing could prevent him from carrying out his purpose. He accordingly  went alone on board that same vessel which had brought him and his  mother, and set sail. He reached the whirlpool, from near which he had  formerly picked up the rubies. This time, however, he determined to go  to the exact spot whence the rubies were coming out. He went to the  centre of the whirlpool, where he saw a gap reaching to the bottom of  the ocean. He dived into it, leaving his boat to wheel round the  whirlpool. When he reached the bottom of the ocean he saw there a  beautiful palace. He went inside. In the central room of the palace  there was the god Siva, with his eyes closed, and absorbed apparently in  intense meditation. A few feet above Siva's head was a platform, on  which lay a young lady of exquisite beauty. The prince went to the  platform and saw that the head of the lady was separated from her body.  Horrified at the sight, he did not know what to make of it. He saw a  stream of blood trickling from the severed head, falling upon the matted  head of Siva, and running into the ocean in the form of rubies. After a  little two small rods, one of silver and one of gold, which were lying  near the head of the lady, attracted his eyes. As he took up the rods in  his hands, the golden rod accidentally fell upon the head, on which the  head immediately joined itself to the body, and the lady got up.  Astonished at the sight of a human being, the lady asked the prince who  he was and how he had got there. After hearing the story of the prince's  adventures, the lady said, \"Unhappy young man, depart instantly from  this place; for when Siva finishes his meditations he will turn you to  ashes by a single glance of his eyes.\" The young man, however, would not  go except in her company, as he was over head and ears in love with the  beautiful lady. At last they both contrived to run away from the palace,  and coming up to the surface of the ocean they climbed into the boat  near the centre of the whirlpool, and sailed away toward land, having  previously laden the vessel with a cargo of rubies. The wonder of the  prince's mother at seeing the beautiful damsel may be well imagined.  Early next morning the prince sent a basin full of big rubies, through a  servant. The king was astonished beyond measure. His daughter, on  getting the rubies, resolved on marrying the wonderful lad who had made  a present of them to her. Though the prince had a wife, whom he had  brought up from the depths of the ocean, he consented to have a second  wife. They were accordingly married, and lived happily for years,  begetting sons and daughters.        Here my story endeth,      The Natiya-thorn withereth, etc.          X    LONG, BROAD, AND SHARPSIGHT      There was a king, who was already old, and had but one son. Once upon a  time he called this son to him and said to him: \"My dear son! you know  that old fruit falls to make room for other fruit. My head is already  ripening, and maybe the sun will soon no longer shine upon it; but  before you bury me, I should like to see your wife, my future daughter.  My son, marry!\" The prince said: \"I would gladly, father, do as you  wish; but I have no bride, and don't know any.\" The old king put his  hand into his pocket, took out a golden key and showed it to his son,  with the words, \"go up into the tower, to the top story, look round  there, and then tell me which you fancy.\" The prince went without delay.  Nobody within the memory of man had been up there or had ever heard what  was up there.    When he got up to the last story, he saw in the ceiling a little iron  door like a trap-door. It was closed. He opened it with the golden key,  lifted it, and went up above it. There was a large circular room. The  ceiling was blue like the sky on a clear night, and silver stars  glittered on it, the floor was a carpet of green silk, and around in the  wall were twelve high windows in golden frames, and in each window on  crystal glass was a damsel painted with the colours of the rainbow, with  a royal crown on her head, in each window a different one in a different  dress, each handsomer than the other, and it was a wonder that the  prince did not let his eyes dwell upon them. When he had gazed at them  with astonishment, the damsels began to move as if they were alive,  looked down upon him, smiled, and did everything but speak.    Now the prince observed that one of the twelve windows was covered with  a white curtain; he drew the curtain to see what was behind it. There  there was a damsel in a white dress, girt with a silver girdle, with a  crown of pearls on her head; she was the most beautiful of all, but was  sad and pale, as if she had risen from the grave. The prince stood long  before the picture, as if he had made a discovery, and as he thus  gazed, his heart pained him, and he cried, \"This one will I have, and no  other.\" As he said the words the damsel bowed her head, blushed like a  rose, and that instant all the pictures disappeared.    When he went down and related to his father what he had seen and which  damsel he had selected, the old king became sad, bethought himself, and  said: \"You have done ill, my son, in uncovering what was curtained over,  and have placed yourself in great danger on account of those words. That  damsel is in the power of a wicked wizard, and kept captive in an iron  castle; of all who have attempted to set her free, not one has hitherto  returned. But what's done cannot be undone; the plighted word is a law.  Go! try your luck, and return home safe and sound!\"    The prince"]]]
