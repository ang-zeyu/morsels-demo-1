With regard to  private vessels of war, the Lords of the Admiralty are empowered by  the 9th Section, to issue Letters of Marque, to the _Commanders_ of  any such ships or vessels,         \"for the attacking and taking any place or fortress upon the       land, or any ship or vessel, arms, ammunition, stores of       war, goods, or merchandize, belonging or possessed by any of       Her Majesty's enemies in any sea, creek, river, or haven.\"    It was the purpose of the persons who brought in this bill, that  Privateers should not be allowed to make depredations upon the coasts  of the enemy for the purpose of plundering individuals, and for that  reason they were restricted to fortified places and fortresses, and to  property water-borne.[91]    As Privateers sometimes sail in company with Queen's vessels, and also  in small squadrons, for the purpose of mutual assistance, the rights  of the privateers vary. When a Privateer is sailing under the convoy  of a Queen's ship, she takes no share in any prize taken by the ship,  or even by herself, unless she has received orders from the convoying  royal ship to give chase, or has acted hostilely against the enemy,  actually aiding and assisting in the capture.[92]    When Privateers have sailed in company, it has often happened that not  every vessel has been actually engaged in the capture of the prize,  though they may have been rendering valuable assistance in a variety  of forms, such as watching in the offing, guarding an open outlet of  escape to the intended prize. In the disputes arising from these joint  captures, Sir William Scott was the first to establish a settled  intelligible system, on principles that might become in future easily  applicable to the various cases that might arise.    [Sidenote: Constructive Captors.]    He says         \"the Act of Parliament (meaning the Prize Act), and the       proclamation, give the benefit of prize to the takers, by       which term, are naturally to be understood those who       _actually take possession_, or those affording an actual       contribution of endeavour to that event; either of these       persons are naturally included under the name of takers, but       the Courts of Law have gone further, and have extended the       term 'takers' to those who, not having contributed actual       service, are supposed to have rendered a constructive       assistance, either by conveying encouragement to the captor,       or intimidation to the enemy. * * * It has been contended       that where ships are associated in a _common enterprize_,       that circumstance is sufficient to entitle them to share       equally and alike in the prizes that are made; but many       cases might be stated when ships so associated would _not_       share. I must ever hold that the principle of mere common       enterprise is not sufficient--it is not sufficiently       specific--it must be more limited. What is the real and true       criterion? She being in sight, or seeing the enemy's fleet       accidentally, a day or two before, will not be sufficient;       it must be at the commencement of the engagement, either in       the act of chasing, or in preparations for chase, or       afterwards during its continuance. If a ship was detached in       sight of the enemy, and under preparation for chase, I       should have no hesitation in saying that she ought to share;       but if she was sent away after the enemy had been descried,       but before any preparations for chase, or any hostile       movements had taken place, I think it would be otherwise;       there must be _some actual contribution of endeavour as well       as a general intention_.\"[93]    [Sidenote: Efforts to suppress Privateering.]    Powerful efforts have been made by humane and enlightened individuals  to suppress Privateering, as inconsistent with the liberal spirit of  the age. In the language of Chancellor Kent,         \"the object is not honour, or chivalric fame, but plunder       and profit. The discipline of the crews is not apt to be of       the highest order, and privateers are often guilty of       enormous excesses, and become the scourge of neutral       commerce.\"    They are sometimes manned and officered by foreigners, having no  permanent connection with the country, or interest in the cause. This  was a complaint made by the United States in 1819, in relation to  irregularities and atrocities committed by private armed vessels,  sailing under the flag of Buenos Ayres. Under the best regulations the  business tends strongly to blunt the sense of private right, and to  nourish a lawless and fierce spirit of rapacity.    Its abolition has generally been attempted by treaty. In the treaty of  Prussia and the United States, in 1785, stipulations against private  armed vessels were included. In 1675, a similar agreement was made  between Sweden and Holland, but the agreement was not performed.  France, soon after the breaking out of the war with Austria, in 1792,  passed a decree for the total suppression of privateering, but that  was a transitory act, and was soon swept away in the tempest of the  Revolution.    [Sidenote: Piratical Privateering.]    On these considerations naturally follows that of the classes of  Privateers that can be considered Pirates.    A Privateer differs from a Pirate, in that--first, the former is  provided with a Commission, or with Letters of Marque from a Sovran,  of which the Pirate is destitute. Secondly, the Privateer supposes a  state of war (or at least that of reprisals); the Pirate plunders in  the midst of peace, as well as in war. Thirdly, the Privateer is  obliged to observe the rules and instructions that have been given  him, and to attack by virtue of them only the enemy's ships, or those  neutral vessels which carry on an illicit commerce; the Pirate  plunders indiscriminately the ships of all nations, without observing  even the laws of war. But in this last point Privateers may become  Pirates when they transgress the limits prescribed to them; and this  is one of the reasons why we often see the former confounded with the  latter.[94]    Under these general definitions, we see that it is quite open to any  citizen of the world to become a privateer under a foreign Sovran; and  Martens goes on to say, that         \"there is nothing that prevents the granting of Letters of       Marque, even to the subjects of neutral or allied powers who       are able to solicit them; but since it is contrary to       neutrality to suffer subjects to contribute by this means to       the reinforcement of one of the belligerent powers, and to       the annoyance of the other, states generally prohibit their       subjects from taking Letters of Marque from a power, without       the permission of their Sovereigns, and many treaties oblige       them also to prohibit their subjects from doing it, as well       as to forbid every species of armaments on the enemy's       account, in their ports. However, the enemy is not justified       in _punishing them as pirates_, when they have letters       patent from one of the powers with whom it is at war,       although their ship may be confiscated.\"[95]    The laws of the United States have made ample provision on this  subject, and they may be considered as an expression of the general  wish of civilized nations; and they prescribed specific punishment for  acts which were before unlawful.    American citizens are prohibited from being concerned, beyond the  limits of the United States, in fitting out or otherwise assisting any  private vessel of war, to cruize against the subjects of friendly  powers.[96]    In the various treaties between the powers of Europe, in the two last  centuries, and in the several treaties between the United States and  France, Holland, Sweden, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, Colombia,  Chili, &c., it is declared, that no subject or citizen of either  nation shall accept a commission or letter of marque, to assist an  enemy in hostilities against the other, under penalty of being treated  as an enemy.[97]    The Title to Property taken in War may, upon general Title to  principles, be considered as immediately divested from the original  owner, and transferred to the captor. As to personal property, the  title is considered as lost to the former proprietor, as soon as the  enemy has acquired a firm possession, which, as a general rule, is  considered as taking place after the lapse of twenty-four hours.[98]    Ships and goods captured _at sea_, are excepted from the operation of  this rule. The right to all captures rests primarily in the Sovran,  and no individual can have any interest in a prize, whether made by a  crown or private armed vessel, but what he receives under the grant of  the state.    When a prize is taken at sea, it must be brought with due care into  some port, for adjudication by a competent court. The condemnation  must be pronounced by a prize court of the Government of the captor,  sitting either in the country of the captor, or of his ally. The prize  court of an ally cannot condemn.[99]    [Sidenote: Proceedings Preliminary to Condemnation.]    The Proceedings Preliminary to Condemnation may be roughly described  as follows:--    The _captor_, immediately on bringing his prize into port, sends up  and delivers upon oath to the registry of the Court of Admiralty, all  papers found on board the prize. The preparatory examinations of the  captain and some of the crew of the _captured ship_ are then taken,  upon a set of standing interrogatories, before the commissioners of  the port to which the prize is brought. These also are forwarded to  the registry of the Court of Admiralty. A written _notice_, called a  _monition_, is extracted by the captor from the registry, and served  upon the Royal Exchange, notifying the capture, and calling upon all  persons interested, to appear and show"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#9)"],[1," murderer was wearing a very remarkable pair of shoes,  and those shoes left very remarkable footprints in the smooth sand, and  those footprints were seen and examined by a very acute and painstaking  police-officer, Sergeant Payne, whose evidence you will hear presently.  The sergeant not only examined the footprints, he made careful drawings  of them on the spot--on the spot, mind you, not from memory--and he made  very exact measurements of them, which he duly noted down. And from  those drawings and those measurements, those tell-tale shoes have been  identified, and are here for your inspection.    \"And now, who is the owner of those very singular, those almost unique  shoes? I have said that the motive of this murder must have been a  personal one, and, behold! the owner of those shoes happens to be the  one person in the whole of this district who could have had a motive for  compassing the murdered man's death. Those shoes belong to, and were  taken from the foot of, the prisoner, Alfred Draper, and the prisoner,  Alfred Draper, is the only person living in this neighbourhood who was  acquainted with the deceased.    \"It has been stated in evidence at the inquest that the relations of  these two men, the prisoner and the deceased, were entirely friendly;  but I shall prove to you that they were not so friendly as has been  supposed. I shall prove to you, by the evidence of the prisoner's  housekeeper, that the deceased was often an unwelcome visitor at the  house, that the prisoner often denied himself when he was really at home  and disengaged, and, in short, that he appeared constantly to shun and  avoid the deceased.    \"One more question and I have finished. Where was the prisoner on the  night of the murder? The answer is that he was in a house little more  than half a mile from the scene of the crime. And who was with him in  that house? Who was there to observe and testify to his going forth and  his coming home? No one. He was alone in the house. On that night, of  all nights, he was alone. Not a soul was there to rouse at the creak of  a door or the tread of a shoe--to tell as whether he slept or whether he  stole forth in the dead of the night.    \"Such are the facts of this case. I believe that they are not disputed,  and I assert that, taken together, they are susceptible of only one  explanation, which is that the prisoner, Alfred Draper, is the man who  murdered the deceased, Charles Hearn.\"    Immediately on the conclusion of this address, the witnesses were  called, and the evidence given was identical with that at the inquest.  The only new witness for the prosecution was Draper's housekeeper, and  her evidence fully bore out Mr. Bashfield's statement. The sergeant's  account of the footprints was listened to with breathless interest, and  at its conclusion the presiding magistrate--a retired solicitor, once  well known in criminal practice--put a question which interested me as  showing how clearly Thorndyke had foreseen the course of events,  recalling, as it did, his remark on the night when we were caught in the  rain.    \"Did you,\" the magistrate asked, \"take these shoes down to the beach and  compare them with the actual footprints?\"    \"I obtained the shoes at night,\" replied the sergeant, \"and I took them  down to the shore at daybreak the next morning. But, unfortunately,  there had been a storm in the night, and the footprints were almost  obliterated by the wind and rain.\"    When the sergeant had stepped down, Mr. Bashfield announced that that  was the case for the prosecution. He then resumed his seat, turning an  inquisitive eye on Anstey and Thorndyke.    The former immediately rose and opened the case for the defence with a  brief statement.    \"The learned counsel for the prosecution,\" said he, \"has told us that  the facts now in the possession of the Court admit of but one  explanation--that of the guilt of the accused. That may or may not be;  but I shall now proceed to lay before the Court certain fresh  facts--facts, I may say, of the most singular and startling character,  which will, I think, lead to a very different conclusion. I shall say no  more, but call the witnesses forthwith, and let the evidence speak for  itself.\"    The first witness for the defence was Thorndyke; and as he entered the  box I observed Polton take up a position close behind him with a large  wicker trunk. Having been sworn, and requested by Anstey to tell the  Court what he knew about the case, he commenced without preamble:    \"About half-past four in the afternoon of the 28th of September I walked  down Sundersley Gap with Dr. Jervis. Our attention was attracted by  certain footprints in the sand, particularly those of a man who had  landed from a boat, had walked up the Gap, and presently returned,  apparently to the boat.    \"As we were standing there Sergeant Payne and Dr. Burrows passed down  the Gap with two constables carrying a stretcher. We followed at a  distance, and as we walked along the shore we encountered another set of  footprints--those which the sergeant has described as the footprints of  the deceased. We examined these carefully, and endeavoured to frame a  description of the person by whom they had been made.\"    \"And did your description agree with the characters of the deceased?\"  the magistrate asked.    \"Not in the least,\" replied Thorndyke, whereupon the magistrate, the  inspector, and Mr. Bashfield laughed long and heartily.    \"When we turned into St. Bridget's Bay, I saw the body of deceased lying  on the sand close to the cliff. The sand all round was covered with  footprints, as if a prolonged, fierce struggle had taken place. There  were two sets of footprints, one set being apparently those of the  deceased and the other those of a man with nailed shoes of a very  peculiar and conspicuous pattern. The incredible folly that the wearing  of such shoes indicated caused me to look more closely at the  footprints, and then I made the surprising discovery that there had in  reality been no struggle; that, in fact, the two sets of footprints had  been made at different times.\"    \"At different times!\" the magistrate exclaimed in astonishment.    \"Yes. The interval between them may have been one of hours or one only  of seconds, but the undoubted fact is that the two sets of footprints  were made, not simultaneously, but in succession.\"    \"But how did you arrive at that fact?\" the magistrate asked.    \"It was very obvious when one looked,\" said Thorndyke. \"The marks of the  deceased man's shoes showed that he repeatedly trod in his own  footprints; but never in a single instance did he tread in the  footprints of the other man, although they covered the same area. The  man with the nailed shoes, on the contrary, not only trod in his own  footprints, but with equal frequency in those of the deceased. Moreover,  when the body was removed, I observed that the footprints in the sand on  which it was lying were exclusively those of the deceased. There was not  a sign of any nail-marked footprint under the corpse, although there  were many close around it. It was evident, therefore, that the  footprints of the deceased were made first and those of the nailed shoes  afterwards.\"    As Thorndyke paused the magistrate rubbed his nose thoughtfully, and  the inspector gazed at the witness with a puzzled frown.    \"The singularity of this fact,\" my colleague resumed, \"made me look at  the footprints yet more critically, and then I made another discovery.  There was a double track of the nailed shoes, leading apparently from  and back to the Shepherd's Path. But on examining these tracks more  closely, I was astonished to find that the man who had made them had  been walking backwards; that, in fact, he had walked backwards from the  body to the Shepherd's Path, had ascended it for a short distance, had  turned round, and returned, still walking backwards, to the face of the  cliff near the corpse, and there the tracks vanished altogether. On the  sand at this spot were some small, inconspicuous marks which might have  been made by the end of a rope, and there were also a few small  fragments which had fallen from the cliff above. Observing these, I  examined the surface of the cliff, and at one spot, about six feet above  the beach, I found a freshly rubbed spot on which were parallel  scratches such as might have been made by the nailed sole of a boot. I  then ascended the Shepherd's Path, and examined the cliff from above,  and here I found on the extreme edge a rather deep indentation, such as  would be made by a taut rope, and, on lying down and looking over, I  could see, some five feet from the top, another rubbed spot with very  distinct parallel scratches.\"    \"You appear to infer,\" said the chairman, \"that this man performed these  astonishing evolutions and was then hauled up the cliff?\"    \"That is what the appearances suggested,\" replied Thorndyke.    The chairman pursed up his lips, raised his eyebrows, and glanced  doubtfully at his brother magistrates. Then, with a resigned air, he  bowed to the witness to indicate that he was listening.    \"That same night,\" Thorndyke resumed, \"I cycled down to the shore,  through the Gap, with a supply of plaster of Paris, and proceeded to  take plaster moulds of the more important of the footprints.\" (Here the  magistrates, the inspector, and Mr. Bashfield with one accord sat up at  attention; Sergeant Payne swore quite audibly; and I experienced a  sudden illumination respecting a certain basin and kitchen spoon which  had so puzzled me on the night of Thorndyke's arrival.) \"As I thought  that liquid plaster might confuse or even obliterate the prints in sand,  I filled up the respective footprints with dry plaster, pressed it down  lightly, and then cautiously poured water on to it. The moulds, which  are excellent impressions, of course show the appearance of the boots  which made the footprints, and from these"]]]
