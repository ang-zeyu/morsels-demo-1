I gave the widow an  equal portion with the married; I did not prefer the rich to the poor.\"    The moral standard thus set up, though satisfactory, so far as it went,  was in many respects deficient. It did not comprise humility; it  scarcely seems to have comprised purity. The religious sculptures of the  Egyptians were grossly indecent; their religious festivals were kept in  an indecent way; phallic orgies were a part of them, and phallic orgies  of a gross kind. The Egyptians tolerated incest, and could defend it by  the example of the gods. Osiris had married his sister; Khem was \"the  Bull of his mother\". The Egyptian novelettes are full of indecency and  immorality, and Egyptian travellers describe their amours very much in  the spirit of Ferdinand, Count Fathom; moreover, the complacency with  which each Egyptian declares himself on his tomb to have possessed every  virtue, and to have been free from all vices, is most remarkable. \"I was  a good man before the king; I saved the population in the dire calamity  which befell all the land; I shielded the weak against the strong; I did  all good things when the time came to do them; I was pious towards my  father, and did the will of my mother; I was kind-hearted towards my  brethren ... I made a good sarcophagus for him who had no coffin. When  the dire calamity befell the land, I made the children to live, I  established the houses, I did for them all such good things as a father  does for his sons.\"    And, notwithstanding all this braggadocio, performance seems to have  lagged sadly behind profession. Kings boast of slaying their unresisting  prisoners with their own hand, and represent themselves in the act of  doing so. They come back from battle with the gory heads of their slain  enemies hanging from their chariots. Licentiousness prevailed in the  palace, and members of the royal harem intrigued with those who sought  the life of the king. A belief in magic was general, and men endeavoured  to destroy or injure those whom they hated by wasting their waxen  effigies at a slow fire to the accompaniment of incantations. Thieves  were numerous, and did not scruple even to violate the sanctity of the  tomb in order to obtain a satisfactory booty. A famous \"thieves'  society,\" formed for the purpose of opening and plundering the royal  tombs, contained among its members persons of the sacerdotal order.    Social ranks in Egypt were divided somewhat sharply. There was a large  class of nobles, who were mostly great landed proprietors living on  their estates, and having under them a vast body of dependents,  servants, labourers, artizans &c. There was also a numerous official  class, partly employed at the court, partly holding government posts  throughout the country, which regarded itself as highly dignified, and  looked down _de haut en has_ on \"the people.\" Commands in the army seem  to have been among the prizes which from time to time fell to the lot of  such persons. Further, there was a literary class, which was eminently  respectable, and which viewed with contempt those who were engaged in  trade or handicrafts.    Below these three classes, and removed from them by a long interval, was  the mass of the population--\"the multitude\" as the Egyptians called  them. These persons were engaged in manual labour of different kinds.  The greater number were employed on the farms of the nobles, in the  cultivation of the soil or in the rearing of cattle. A portion were  boatmen, fishermen, or fowlers. Others pursued the various known  handicrafts. They were weavers, workers in metal, stone-cutters, masons,  potters, carpenters, upholsterers, tailors, shoe-makers, glass-blowers,  boat-builders, wig-makers, and embalmers. There were also among them  painters and sculptors. But all these employments \"stank\" in the  nostrils of the upper classes, and were regarded as unworthy of any one  who wished to be thought respectable.    Still, the line of demarcation, decided as it was, might be crossed. It  is an entire mistake to suppose that caste existed in Egypt. Men  frequently bred up their sons to their own trade or profession, as they  do in all countries, but they were not obliged to do so--there was  absolutely no compulsion in the matter. The \"public-schools\" of Egypt  were open to all comers, and the son of the artizan sat on the same  bench with the son of the noble, enjoyed the same education, and had an  equal opportunity of distinguishing himself. If he showed sufficient  promise, he was recommended to adopt the literary life; and the literary  life was the sure passport to State employment. State employment once  entered upon, merit secured advancement; and thus there was, in fact, no  obstacle to prevent the son of a labouring man from rising to the very  highest positions in the administration of the empire. Successful  ministers were usually rewarded by large grants of land from the royal  domain; and it follows that a clever youth of the labouring class might  by good conduct and ability make his way even into the ranks of the  landed aristocracy.    On the other hand, practically, the condition of the labouring class  was, generally speaking, a hard and sad one. The kings were entitled to  employ as many of their subjects as they pleased in forced labours, and  monarchs often sacrificed to their inordinate vanity the lives and  happiness of thousands. Private employers of labour were frequently  cruel and exacting; their overseers used the stick, and it was not easy  for those who suffered to obtain any redress. Moreover, taxation was  heavy, and inability to satisfy the collector subjected the defaulter to  the bastinado. Those who have studied the antiquities of Egypt with most  care, tell us that there was not much to choose between the condition of  the ancient labourers and that of the unhappy _fellahin_[6] of the  present day.        FOOTNOTES:    [4] Nefer-hotep, a deceased king.    [5] Brugsch, \"Histoire d'Egypte,\" p. 15.    [6] A fellah is a peasant, one of the labouring class, just above the  slave.          III.    THE DAWN OF HISTORY.      All nations, unless they be colonies, have a prehistoric time--a dark  period of mist and gloom, before the keen light of history dawns upon  them. This period is the favourite playground of the myth-spirits, where  they disport themselves freely, or lounge heavily and listlessly,  according to their different natures. The Egyptian spirits were of the  heavier and duller kind--not light and frolicsome, like the Greek and  the Indo-Iranian. It has been said that Egypt never produced more than  one myth, the Osirid legend; and this is so far true that in no other  case is the story told at any considerable length, or with any  considerable number of exciting incidents. There are, however, many  short legends in the Egyptian remains, which have more or less of  interest, and show that the people was not altogether devoid of  imagination, though their imagination was far from lively. Seb, for  instance, once upon a time, took the form of a goose, and laid the  mundane egg, and hatched it. Thoth once wrote a wonderful book, full of  wisdom and science, which told of everything concerning the fowls of the  air, and the fishes of the sea, and the four-footed beasts of the earth.  He who knew a single page of the book could charm the heaven, the  earth, the great abyss, the mountains, and the seas. Thoth took the work  and enclosed it in a box of gold, and the box of gold he placed within a  box of silver, and the silver box within a box of ivory and ebony, and  that again within a box of bronze; and the bronze box he enclosed within  a box of brass, and the brass box within a box of iron; and the box,  thus guarded, he threw into the Nile at Coptos. But a priest discovered  the whereabouts of the book, and sold the knowledge to a young noble for  a hundred pieces of silver, and the young noble with great trouble  fished the book up. But the possession of the book brought him not good  but evil. He lost his wife; he lost his child; he became entangled in a  disgraceful intrigue. He was glad to part with the book. But the next  possessor was not more fortunate; the book brought him no luck. The  quest after unlawful knowledge involved all who sought it in calamity.    Another myth had for its subject the proposed destruction of mankind by  Ra, the Sun-god. Ra had succeeded Phthah as king of Egypt, and had  reigned for a long term of years in peace, contented with his subjects  and they with him. But a time came when they grew headstrong and unruly;  they uttered words against Ra; they plotted evil things; they grievously  offended him. So Ra called the council of the gods together and asked  them to advise him what he should do. They said mankind must be  destroyed, and committed the task of destruction to Athor and Sekhet,  who proceeded to smite the men over the whole land. But now fear came  upon mankind; and the men of Elephantine made haste, and extracted the  juice from the best of their fruits, and mingled it with human blood,  and filled seven thousand jars, and brought them as an offering to the  offended god. Ra drank and was content, and ordered the liquor that  remained in the jars to be poured out; and, lo! it was an inundation  which covered the whole land of Egypt; and when Athor went forth the  next day to destroy, she saw no men in the fields, but only water, which  she drank, and it pleased her, and she went away satisfied.    It would require another Euhemerus to find any groundwork of history in  these narratives. We must turn away from the \"shadow-land\" which the  Egyptians called the time of the gods on earth, if we would find trace  of the real doings of men in the Nile valley, and put before our readers  actual human beings in the place of airy phantoms. The Egyptians  themselves taught that the first man of whom they had any record was a  king called M'na, a name "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#9)"],[1," Other nouns have one gender in the Singular, another in the Plural;  as,--      SINGULAR.

The Gen. Sing. Masc. and Neut. of Adjectives in -ius ends in -ii (not in  -i as in case of Nouns; see Sec. 25, 1; 2). So also the Voc. Sing. of such  Adjectives ends in -ie, not in i. Thus eximius forms Gen. eximii; Voc.  eximie.    2. Distributives (see Sec. 78, 1, c) regularly form the Gen. Plu. Masc. and  Neut. in -um instead of -orum (compare Sec. 25, 6); as, denum centenum; but  always singulorum.    64. Masculine like puer:--                         Tener, _tender_.                            SINGULAR.            MASCULINE.

Most adjectives in -er are declined like sacer. The following however,  are declined like tener: asper, _rough_; lacer, _torn_; liber, _free_;  miser, _wretched_; prosper, _prosperous_; compounds in -fer and -ger;  sometimes dexter, _right_.    2. Satur, _full_, is declined: satur, satura, saturum.    Nine Irregular Adjectives.    66. Here belong--      alius, _another_;           alter, _the other_;    ullus, _any_;               nullus, _none_;    uter, _which?_ (of two);    neuter, _neither_;    solus, _alone_;             totus, _whole_;                  unus, _one_, _alone_.

These fall into three classes,--    1. Adjectives of three terminations in the Nominative Singular,--one for  each gender.    2. Adjectives of two terminations.    3. Adjectives of one termination.      a. With the exception of Comparatives, and a few other words mentioned    below in Sec. 70, 1, all Adjectives of the Third Declension follow the    inflection of i-stems; i.e. they have the Ablative Singular in -i, the    Genitive Plural in -ium, the Accusative Plural in -is (as well as -es) in    the Masculine and Feminine, and the Nominative and Accusative Plural in    -ia in Neuters.    Adjectives of Three Terminations.    68. These are declined as follows:--                          Acer, _sharp_.                            SINGULAR.            MASCULINE.      FEMININE.

Celer, celeris, celere, _swift_, retains the e before r, but lacks the  Genitive Plural.    3. In the Nominative Singular of Adjectives of this class the Feminine form  is sometimes used for the Masculine. This is regularly true of salubris,  silvestris, and terrestris. In case of the other words in the list, the use  of the Feminine for the Masculine is confined chiefly to early and late  Latin, and to poetry.    Adjectives of Two Terminations.    69. These are declined as follows:--                   Fortis, _strong._              Fortior, _stronger._                                  SINGULAR.            M. AND F.       NEUT.           M.
