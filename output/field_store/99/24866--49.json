He fenced with Mr. Smart's inquiry as best he could, saying that he was  ignorant of the history of the instrument, but not contradicting the  assumption that it had been a long time in his family's possession.    \"It is indeed singular,\" Mr. Smart continued, \"that so magnificent  an instrument should have lain buried so long; that even those best  acquainted with such matters should be in perfect ignorance of its  existence. I shall have to revise the list of famous instruments in the  next edition of my 'History of the Violin,' and to write,\" he added  smiling, \"a special paragraph on the 'Worth Maltravers Stradivarius.'\"    After much more, which I need not narrate, Mr. Smart suggested that  the violin should be left with him that he might examine it more at  leisure, and that my brother should return in a week's time, when he  would have the instrument opened, an operation which would be in any  case advisable. \"The interior,\" he added, \"appears to be in a strictly  original state, and this I shall be able to ascertain when opened. The  label is perfect, but if I am not mistaken I can see something higher up  on the back which appears like a second label. This excites my interest,  as I know of no instance of an instrument bearing two labels.\"    To this proposal my brother readily assented, being anxious to enjoy  alone the pleasure of so gratifying a discovery as that of the undoubted  authenticity of the instrument.    As he thought over the matter more at leisure, he grew anxious as to  what might be the import of the second label in the violin of which Mr.  Smart had spoken. I blush to say that he feared lest it might bear some  owner's name or other inscription proving that the instrument had not  been so long in the Maltravers family as he had allowed Mr. Smart to  suppose. So within so short a time it was possible that Sir John  Maltravers of Worth should dread being detected, if not in an absolute  falsehood, at least in having by his silence assented to one.    During the ensuing week John remained in an excited and anxious  condition. He did little work, and neglected his friends, having his  thoughts continually occupied with the strange discovery he had made.  I know also that his sense of honour troubled him, and that he was not  satisfied with the course he was pursuing. The evening of his return  from London he went to Mr. Gaskell's rooms at New College, and spent an  hour conversing with him on indifferent subjects. In the course of their  talk he proposed to his friend as a moral problem the question of the  course of action to be taken were one to find some article of value  concealed in his room. Mr. Gaskell answered unhesitatingly that he  should feel bound to disclose it to the authorities. He saw that my  brother was ill at ease, and with a clearness of judgment which he  always exhibited, guessed that he had actually made some discovery of  this sort in the old cupboard in his rooms. He could not divine, of  course, the exact nature of the object found, and thought it might  probably relate to a hoard of gold; but insisted with much urgency on  the obligation to at once disclose anything of this kind. My brother,  however, misled, I fear, by that feeling of inalienable right which the  treasure-hunter experiences over the treasure, paid no more attention to  the advice of his friend than to the promptings of his own conscience,  and went his way.    From that day, my dear Edward, he began to exhibit a spirit of  secretiveness and reserve entirely alien to his own open and honourable  disposition, and also saw less of Mr. Gaskell. His friend tried, indeed,  to win his confidence and affection in every way in his power; but in  spite of this the rift between them widened insensibly, and my brother  lost the fellowship and counsel of a true friend at a time when he could  ill afford to be without them.    He returned to London the ensuing week, and met Mr. George Smart by  appointment in Bond Street. If the expert had been enthusiastic on a  former occasion, he was ten times more so on this. He spoke in terms  almost of rapture about the violin. He had compared it with two  magnificent instruments in the collection of the late Mr. James Loding,  then the finest in Europe; and it was admittedly superior to either,  both in the delicate markings of its wood and singularly fine varnish.  \"Of its tone,\" he said, \"we cannot, of course, yet pronounce with  certainty, but I am very sure that its voice will not belie its splendid  exterior. It has been carefully opened, and is in a strangely perfect  condition. Several persons eminently qualified to judge unite with me  in considering that it has been exceedingly little played upon, and  admit that never has so intact an interior been seen. The scroll is  exceptionally bold and original. Although undoubtedly from the hand of  the great master, this is of a pattern entirely different and distinct  from any that have ever come under my observation.\"    He then pointed out to my brother that the side lines of the scroll were  unusually deeply cut, and that the front of it projected far more than  is common with such instruments.    \"The most remarkable feature,\" he concluded, \"is that the instrument  bears a double label. Besides the label which you have already seen  bearing '_Antonius Stradiuarius Cremonensis faciebat_,' with the date of  his most splendid period, 1704, so clearly that the ink seems scarcely  dry, there is another smaller one higher up on the back which I will  show you.\"    He took the violin apart and showed him a small label with characters  written in faded ink. \"That is the writing of Antonio Stradivarius  himself, and is easily recognisable, though it is much firmer than  a specimen which I once saw, written in extreme old age, and giving  his name and the date 1736. He was then ninety-two, and died in the  following year. But this, as you will see, does not give his name, but  merely the two words '_Porphyrius philosophus_.' What this may refer  to I cannot say: it is beyond my experience. My friend Mr. Calvert has  suggested that Stradivarius may have dedicated this violin to the pagan  philosopher, or named it after him; but this seems improbable. I have,  indeed, heard of two famous violins being called 'Peter' and 'Paul,'  but the instances of such naming are very rare; and I believe it to be  altogether without precedent to find a name attached thus on a label.    \"In any case, I must leave this matter to your ingenuity to decipher.  Neither the sound-post nor the bass-bar have ever been moved, and you  see here a Stradivarius violin wearing exactly the same appearance as  it once wore in the great master's workshop, and in exactly the same  condition; yet I think the belly is sufficiently strong to stand modern  stringing. I should advise you to leave the instrument with me for some  little while, that I may give it due care and attention and ensure its  being properly strung.\"    My brother thanked him and left the violin with him, saying that he  would instruct him later by letter to what address he wished it sent.          CHAPTER VIII      Within a few days after this the autumn term came to an end, and in  the second week of December John returned to Worth Maltravers for  the Christmas vacation. His advent was always a very great pleasure  to me, and on this occasion I had looked forward to his company with  anticipation keener than usual, as I had been disappointed of the visit  of a friend and had spent the last month alone. After the joy of our  first meeting had somewhat sobered, it was not long before I remarked a  change in his manner, which puzzled me. It was not that he was less kind  to me, for I think he was even more tenderly forbearing and gentle than  I had ever known him, but I had an uneasy feeling that some shadow had  crept in between us. It was the small cloud rising in the distance that  afterwards darkened his horizon and mine. I missed the old candour and  open-hearted frankness that he had always shown; and there seemed to be  always something in the background which he was trying to keep from me.  It was obvious that his thoughts were constantly elsewhere, so much so  that on more than one occasion he returned vague and incoherent answers  to my questions. At times I was content to believe that he was in love,  and that his thoughts were with Miss Constance Temple; but even so,  I could not persuade myself that his altered manner was to be thus  entirely accounted for. At other times a dazed air, entirely foreign to  his bright disposition, which I observed particularly in the morning,  raised in my mind the terrible suspicion that he was in the habit of  taking some secret narcotic or other deleterious drug.    We had never spent a Christmas away from Worth Maltravers, and it had  always been a season of quiet joy for both of us. But under these  altered circumstances it was a great relief and cause of thankfulness  to me to receive a letter from Mrs. Temple inviting us both to spend  Christmas and New Year at Royston. This invitation had upon my brother  precisely the effect that I had hoped for. It roused him from his moody  condition, and he professed much pleasure in accepting it, especially as  he had never hitherto been in Derbyshire.    There was a small but very agreeable party at Royston, and we passed a  most enjoyable fortnight. My brother seemed thoroughly to have shaken  off his indisposition; and I saw my fondest hopes realised in the warm  attachment which was evidently springing up between him and Miss  Constance Temple.    Our visit drew near its close, and it was within a week of John's return  to Oxford. Mrs. Temple celebrated the termination of the Christmas  festivities by giving a ball on Twelfth-night, at which a large party  were present, including most of the county families.

[Footnote 46: Noer, I, 490 n.]    Germany should be proud that the personality of Akbar who according to  his own words \"desired to live at peace with all humanity, with every  creature of God,\" has so inspired a noble German of princely blood in  the last century that he consecrated the work of his life to the  biography of Akbar. This man is the Prince Friedrich August of  Schleswig-Holstein, Count of Noer, who wandered through the whole of  Northern India on the track of Akbar's activities, and on the basis  of the most careful investigation of sources has given us in his large  two-volumed work the best and most extensive information which has  been written in Europe about the Emperor Akbar. How much his work has  been a labor of love can be recognized at every step in his book but  especially may be seen in a touching letter from Agra written on the  24th of April, 1868, in which he relates that he utilized the early  hours of this day for an excursion to lay a bunch of fresh roses on  Akbar's grave and that no visit to any other grave had ever moved him  so much as this.[47]      [Footnote 47: Noer, II, 564, 572.]    [Illustration]"]]]
