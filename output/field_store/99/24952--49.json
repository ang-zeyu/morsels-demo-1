Here a long halt was made in order to  reorganize the attack, and when the word was given the men pressed  forward and threw-themselves upon the rough front of the acclivity after  a rush across an open slope. The crest was attained and carried without  much difficulty; for all but a few stalwarts had quitted it when they  saw the British bayonets pricking upwards towards their hold.    It seemed now that the victory was won, but an unfortunate mistake  postponed it. The two field batteries on the plain, which had ceased  fire before the final infantry rush, changed position and came under a  heavy fire from the Boers who were still in possession of a section of  the Talana ridge. The light was bad and the guns re-opened upon the  crest line in the belief that the whole of it was still occupied by the  enemy. The practice was excellent, and in a brief space both sides were  driven off the hill by the shrapnel. A subsequent attempt to take it was  successful. The result of the battle, which lasted from sunrise until 2  p.m., might have been reversed but for the inaction of the main Boer  force posted on Lennox Hill under L. Meyer, and of another force on  Impati under Erasmus, who, though he could hear the noise of battle  pealing through the mist which lay upon the hill, abstained from  intervening.    The whole Boer force was now in full retreat along the line by which it  had advanced so silently the night before, and Yule ordered the two  field batteries up to the nek between Talana and Lennox to pound the  retreating burghers as they slowly trekked towards the Buffalo River;  but again an unfortunate misapprehension intervened. The officer in  command, being under the impression that an armistice asked for by Meyer  two hours before had been granted, refrained from opening fire and the  Boers escaped untouched. A serious misadventure marred the success of  the day. The 18th Hussars, who at the commencement of the action  received orders to hold themselves in readiness to advance when occasion  offers, soon appeared to the restless general to be losing their  opportunity, and were hustled into activity. They charged in various  directions and even made some prisoners; but one squadron lost its way  and was captured in an attempt to ride round Impati by a detachment of  Erasmus' force at a farm where it had taken refuge.    The fight for Talana Hill encouraged each belligerent. In England it was  received as an indication of the early and successful termination of the  struggle. The Boers regarded it as a reconnaissance in force from which  they had returned with slight loss, and they could boast that they had  reaped the first fruits of the harvest of war; a squadron of British  cavalry which, with the commanding officer of the regiment, was at once  dispatched into captivity at Pretoria, where its arrival was accepted as  a proof of a great Boer victory in Natal.    Talana Hill regarded as an isolated event in the Natal campaign was a  distinctly successful encounter, the credit of which is due entirely to  the infantry engaged in it. Twice the artillery blundered, and the  cavalry was inoperative. The extent of the loss suffered by the Natal  Field Force in the death of Symons must always be a matter for  speculation. But it is at least probable that if he had survived to take  part in the subsequent operations, his ardent, impetuous, Prince Rupert  like temperament would have beneficially impregnated with greater  audacity the stolid and ponderous tactics and strategy of the Natal  campaign.    The unreality of the Talana Hill victory soon became apparent. The  threat of Erasmus sitting on Impati still impended, and Yule moved his  camp next day to a site which he believed to be out of range. But in the  meantime Erasmus awoke from his trance and, on the afternoon of October  21, opened fire with a six-inch gun,[18] and again Yule was compelled to  shift his camp. He had already asked for reinforcements, but White was  unable to spare them, and recommended him to fall back upon Ladysmith.  Next day Yule was encouraged by the news of a British success at  Elandslaagte; and with the object of intercepting the Boers who were  reported to be retreating on Newcastle, he endeavoured to seize Glencoe,  but Erasmus on Impati forbade the movement.    Shortly before midnight on October 19, Kock, a Free Stater who commanded  a force chiefly composed of foreign auxiliaries and who was working  southwards from Newcastle, sent on an advanced party to swoop down upon  the railway between Ladysmith and Glencoe, and Elandslaagte station was  seized. Early next morning Kock came in with his main body. White at  first made no serious attempt to clear the line beyond sending out a  reconnoitring force which he soon recalled, as he was reluctant to  employ troops away from the immediate neighbourhood of Ladysmith, which  had been already threatened on the N.W. by Free State commandos.    The news however of Yule's success at Talana changed the situation and  seemed to justify a more forward policy; and early in the morning of  October 21 French was sent out to re-occupy Elandslaagte and repair the  line. Although he succeeded in driving the enemy out of the railway  station and in holding it for a very brief period, he found himself  outclassed in artillery and too weak to stand up to the Boers, and  withdrew a few miles southward; at the same time asking White to  reinforce him. It was reported that Kock expected shortly to be  reinforced.    The main Boer position was on the northern limb of a horseshoe  arrangement of kopjes which develops close to the railway station and  swings round southwards and westwards, at an elevation generally about  300 feet above the normal level of the ground. Two posts were also held  north of the railway. The southern limb of the horseshoe was lightly  held, and against it French, without waiting for the arrival of all his  reinforcements, moved with his mounted troops, and easily cleared it.  Here he was joined by the Manchester Regiment, one of the battalions of  the brigade of infantry sent out by White under the command of Ian  Hamilton, and established himself on the left flank of the Boer position  on the two kopjes on the northern limb of the horseshoe.    The other two battalions, the Devonshire Regiment and the Gordon  Highlanders, simultaneously came into position, the former for a frontal  attack, and the latter as a reserve acting in the interval between the  Manchesters and the Devons; while the artillery advanced between the two  limbs and shelled the enemy's position on the kopjes. The artillery  preparation enjoined by the regulations had, however, to be curtailed  owing to the approach of night, but not before the two Boer guns on the  southern kopje were silenced; and then the main attack was delivered.    The Boers on the kopjes were reinforced by a body of German auxiliaries  under Schiel, who had been driven out of a position north of the railway  by the cavalry acting on the left and who circled round to the main  position, but the reinforcement did not avail them. Hardly pressed on  their left, they were unable to withstand the frontal charge of the  Devons led by Hamilton in person. The guns were captured and the  position occupied at sunset. By this time most of the Boers were in  retreat and their tracks were made devious by the cavalry, which so long  as light remained harried them hither and thither.    Suddenly a white flag was seen fluttering near the laager between the  kopjes. There is no reason to believe that it was treacherously raised,  but it compelled Hamilton to order the Cease Fire. Yet at once half a  hundred Boers started up and rushed as a forlorn hope upon the crest: a  remnant of stalwarts, who even succeeded in firing a round or two from  the guns which had just been taken from them. There was a moment or two  of doubt and bewilderment, but Hamilton with the help of a few junior  officers rallied the waverers, and earned the Victoria Cross, which on  account of his high military rank was withheld from him; the guns were  recovered, the laager rushed, and the tactical victory was complete.    Elandslaagte was as unreal a victory as Talana. The troops had not  rested many hours in their bivouacs on the ridge before they received  orders to return without delay to Ladysmith, which was still threatened  from the west by the Free State commandos; and by noon on October 22 not  only had Elandslaagte been hurriedly evacuated, but stores, ammunition  and even some prisoners had been left behind in the scuttle. Next day it  passed without effort into the possession of a small body of Free  Staters, who were astonished to find it abandoned.    Meanwhile Yule after the failure of his movement on Glencoe found his  position insecure and reluctantly resolved to retire on Ladysmith,  although it entailed leaving not only his supplies and ammunition but  also his wounded behind him. The victory of Talana had indeed been won  but the victors were exhausted by it and unfit to stand up to Erasmus on  Impati. It became necessary for Yule to disappear immediately and  stealthily.    On October 23 soon after midnight the maimed and harassed force slipped  quietly away and trudged wearily to the south. When the mist rolling  aside next morning disclosed the evacuation the Transvaalers on Impati  occupied the town almost simultaneously with the reoccupation of  Elandslaagte by their allies the Free Staters; and thus the battlefields  of two British victories were redeemed by the defeated. It is no  reproach to Yule that military necessity compelled him to leave behind  the wounded of Talana Hill. The death of Symons on October 23 was a  pathetic episode of the Natal Campaign. He passed away of his mortal  wound while the Boers were looting the camp in which he was lying and  wondering, in the rare"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#9)"],[1,"the attention of our table.    1st.  What shape are the rooms in an octagon house?  Some of the girls  insist that they're square; but I think they'd have to be shaped like a  piece of pie.  Don't you?    2nd.  Suppose there were a great big hollow sphere made of  looking-glass and you were sitting inside.  Where would it stop  reflecting your face and begin reflecting your back?  The more one  thinks about this problem, the more puzzling it becomes.  You can see  with what deep philosophical reflection we engage our leisure!    Did I ever tell you about the election?  It happened three weeks ago,  but so fast do we live, that three weeks is ancient history.  Sallie  was elected, and we had a torchlight parade with transparencies saying,  'McBride for Ever,' and a band consisting of fourteen pieces (three  mouth organs and eleven combs).    We're very important persons now in '258.' Julia and I come in for a  great deal of reflected glory.  It's quite a social strain to be living  in the same house with a president.    Bonne nuit, cher Daddy.                           Acceptez mez compliments,                             Tres respectueux,                                 je suis,                                     Votre Judy                                                         12th November    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    We beat the Freshmen at basket ball yesterday.  Of course we're  pleased--but oh, if we could only beat the juniors!  I'd be willing to  be black and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witch-hazel  compress.    Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her.  She  lives in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Wasn't it nice of her?  I shall  love to go.  I've never been in a private family in my life, except at  Lock Willow, and the Semples were grown-up and old and don't count.  But the McBrides have a houseful of children (anyway two or three) and  a mother and father and grandmother, and an Angora cat.  It's a  perfectly complete family!  Packing your trunk and going away is more  fun than staying behind.  I am terribly excited at the prospect.    Seventh hour--I must run to rehearsal.  I'm to be in the Thanksgiving  theatricals.  A prince in a tower with a velvet tunic and yellow curls.  Isn't that a lark?                                           Yours,                                                     J. A.                                                             Saturday    Do you want to know what I look like?  Here's a photograph of all three  that Leonora Fenton took.    The light one who is laughing is Sallie, and the tall one with her nose  in the air is Julia, and the little one with the hair blowing across  her face is Judy--she is really more beautiful than that, but the sun  was in her eyes.                                         'STONE GATE',                                     WORCESTER, MASS.,                                           31st December    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas cheque,  but life in the McBride household is very absorbing, and I don't seem  able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk.    I bought a new gown--one that I didn't need, but just wanted.  My  Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family just  sent love.    I've been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie.  She  lives in a big old-fashioned brick house with white trimmings set back  from the street--exactly the kind of house that I used to look at so  curiously when I was in the John Grier Home, and wonder what it could  be like inside.  I never expected to see with my own eyes--but here I  am!  Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike; I walk from  room to room and drink in the furnishings.    It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in; with  shadowy nooks for hide and seek, and open fire places for pop-corn, and  an attic to romp in on rainy days and slippery banisters with a  comfortable flat knob at the bottom, and a great big sunny kitchen, and  a nice, fat, sunny cook who has lived in the family thirteen years and  always saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake.  Just the  sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again.    And as for families!  I never dreamed they could be so nice.  Sallie  has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest  three-year-old baby sister all over curls, and a medium-sized brother  who always forgets to wipe his feet, and a big, good-looking brother  named Jimmie, who is a junior at Princeton.    We have the jolliest times at the table--everybody laughs and jokes and  talks at once, and we don't have to say grace beforehand.  It's a  relief not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat.  (I  dare say I'm blasphemous; but you'd be, too, if you'd offered as much  obligatory thanks as I have.)    Such a lot of things we've done--I can't begin to tell you about them.  Mr. McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for the  employees' children.  It was in the long packing-room which was  decorated with evergreens and holly.  Jimmie McBride was dressed as  Santa Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents.    Dear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation!  I felt as benevolent as  a Trustee of the John Grier home.  I kissed one sweet, sticky little  boy--but I don't think I patted any of them on the head!    And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for  ME.    It was the first really true ball I ever attended--college doesn't  count where we dance with girls.  I had a new white evening gown (your  Christmas present--many thanks) and long white gloves and white satin  slippers.  The only drawback to my perfect, utter, absolute happiness  was the fact that Mrs. Lippett couldn't see me leading the cotillion  with Jimmie McBride.  Tell her about it, please, the next time you  visit the J. G. H.                           Yours ever,                                      Judy Abbott      PS.  Would you be terribly displeased, Daddy, if I didn't turn out to  be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain Girl?                                                 6.30, Saturday    Dear Daddy,    We started to walk to town today, but mercy! how it poured.  I like  winter to be winter with snow instead of rain.    Julia's desirable uncle called again this afternoon--and brought a  five-pound box of chocolates.  There are advantages, you see, about  rooming with Julia.    Our innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited for a later  train in order to take tea in the study.  We had an awful lot of  trouble getting permission.  It's hard enough entertaining fathers and  grandfathers, but uncles are a step worse; and as for brothers and  cousins, they are next to impossible.  Julia had to swear that he was  her uncle before a notary public and then have the county clerk's  certificate attached.  (Don't I know a lot of law?) And even then I  doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean had chanced to see how  youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.    Anyway, we had it, with brown bread Swiss cheese sandwiches.  He helped  make them and then ate four.  I told him that I had spent last summer  at Lock Willow, and we had a beautiful gossipy time about the Semples,  and the horses and cows and chickens.  All the horses that he used to  know are dead, except Grover, who was a baby colt at the time of his  last visit--and poor Grove now is so old he can just limp about the  pasture.    He asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue  plate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantry--and they do!  He  wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck's hole under the pile of  rocks in the night pasture--and there is!  Amasai caught a big, fat,  grey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson of the one  Master Jervis caught when he was a little boy.    I called him 'Master Jervie' to his face, but he didn't appear to be  insulted.  Julia says she has never seen him so amiable; he's usually  pretty unapproachable.  But Julia hasn't a bit of tact; and men, I  find, require a great deal.  They purr if you rub them the right way  and spit if you don't. (That isn't a very elegant metaphor.  I mean it  figuratively.)    We're reading Marie Bashkirtseff's journal.  Isn't it amazing?  Listen  to this:  'Last night I was seized by a fit of despair that found  utterance in moans, and that finally drove me to throw the dining-room  clock into the sea.'    It makes me almost hope I'm not a genius; they must be very wearing to  have about--and awfully destructive to the furniture.    Mercy! how it keeps Pouring.  We shall have to swim to chapel tonight.                                   Yours ever,                                                 Judy                                                         20th Jan.    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen from the cradle in  infancy?    Maybe I am she!  If we were in a novel, that would be the denouement,  wouldn't it?    It's really awfully queer not to know what one is--sort of exciting and  romantic.  There are such a lot of possibilities.  Maybe I'm not  American; lots of people aren't. I may be straight descended from the  ancient Romans, or I may be a Viking's daughter, or I may be the child  of a Russian exile and belong by rights in a Siberian prison, or maybe  I'm a Gipsy--I think perhaps I am.  I have a very WANDERING spirit,  though I haven't as yet had much chance to develop it.    Do you know about that one scandalous blot in my career the time I ran  away from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies?  It's down in the books free for any Trustee to read.  But really,  Daddy, what could you expect?  When you put a hungry little nine-year  girl in the pantry scouring knives, with the cookie jar at"]]]
