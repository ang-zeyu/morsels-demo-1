Germany's Submarine War      LONDON, March 13.--The Admiralty announced tonight that the British  collier Invergyle was torpedoed today off Cresswell, England, and sunk.  All aboard were saved.    This brings the total British losses of merchantmen and fishing vessels,  either sunk or captured during the war, up to 137. Of these ninety were  merchant ships and forty-seven were fishing craft.    A further submarine casualty today was the torpedoing of the Swedish  steamer Halma off Scarborough, and the loss of the lives of six of her  crew.    The Admiralty announces that since March 10 seven British merchant  steamers have been torpedoed by submarines. Two of them, it is stated,  were sunk, and of two others it is said that \"the sinking is not  confirmed.\" Three were not sunk.    The two steamers officially reported sunk were the Invergyle and the  Indian City, which was torpedoed off the Scilly Islands on March 12. The  crew of the Indian City was reported rescued.    The two steamers whose reported sinking is not yet officially confirmed  are the Florazan, which was torpedoed at the mouth of the Bristol  Channel on March 11, all of her crew being landed at Milford Haven, with  the exception of one fireman, and the Andalusian, which was attacked off  the Scilly Islands on March 12. The crew of the Andalusian is reported  to have been rescued.    The Adenwen was torpedoed in the English Channel on March 11, and has  since been towed into Cherbourg. Her crew was landed at Brisham.    The steamer Headlands was torpedoed on March 12 off the Scilly Islands.  It is reported that her crew was saved. The steamer Hartdale was  torpedoed on March 13 off South Rock, in the Irish Channel. Twenty-one  of her crew were picked up and two were lost.    Supplementary to the foregoing the Admiralty tonight issued a report  giving the total number of British merchant and fishing vessels lost  through hostile action from the outbreak of the war to March 10. The  statement says that during that period eighty-eight merchant vessels  were sunk or captured. Of these fifty-four were victims of hostile  cruisers, twelve were destroyed by mines, and twenty-two by submarines.  Their gross tonnage totaled 309,945.    In the same period the total arrivals and sailings of overseas steamers  of all nationalities of more than 300 tons net were 4,745.    Forty-seven fishing vessels were sunk or captured during this time.  Nineteen of these were blown up by mines and twenty-eight were captured  by hostile craft. Twenty-four of those captured were caught on Aug. 26,  when the Germans raided a fishing fleet.    [Illustration: Dotted portion indicates the limits of \"War Zone\" defined  in the German order which became effective Feb. 18, 1915.]          German People Not Blinded    By Karl Lamprecht    [Published in New York by the German Information Service, Feb. 3, 1915.]           Denying flatly that the German people were swept blindly and       ignorantly into the war by the headlong ambitions of their       rulers--the view advanced by Dr. Charles W. Eliot, President       Emeritus of Harvard University, and Dr. Nicholas Murray       Butler, President of Columbia--Dr. Karl Lamprecht, Professor       of History in the University of Leipsic and world-famous       German historian, has addressed the open letter which appears       below to the two distinguished American scholars. Dr.       Lamprecht asserts that under the laws which govern the German       Empire the people as citizens have a deciding will in affairs       of state and that Germany is engaged in the present conflict       because the sober judgment of the German people led them to       resort to arms.    _Dr. C.W. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University; Dr. N.M.  Butler, President of Columbia University._    Gentlemen: I feel confident that you are not in ignorance of my regard  and esteem for the great American Republic and its citizens. They have  been freely expressed on many occasions and have taken definite form in  the journal of my travels through the United States, published in the  booklet \"Americana,\" 1905.    My sentiments and my judgment have not changed since 1905. I now refer,  gentlemen, to the articles and speeches which you have published about  my country and which have aroused widespread interest. I will not  criticise your utterances one by one. If I did that I might have to  speak on occasion with a frankness that would be ungracious, considering  the fine appreciation which both of you still feel for old Germany. It  would be specially ungracious toward you, President Eliot, for in quite  recent times you honored me by your ready help in my scientific labors.  All I want to do is to remove a few fundamental errors--in fact, only  one. I feel in duty bound to do so, since many well-disposed Americans  share that error.    The gravest and perhaps most widely spread misconception about us  Germans is that we are the serfs of our Princes. (Fuerstenknechte,)  servile and dependent in political thought. That false notion has  probably been dispelled during the initial weeks of the present war.    With absolute certainty the German Nation, with one voice and  correctly, diagnosed the political situation without respect to party or  creed and unanimously and of its own free will acted.    But this misconception is so deep rooted that more extended discussion  is needed. I pass on to other matters.    The essential point is that public opinion have free scope of  development. Every American will admit that. Now, public opinion finds  its expression in the principles that govern the use of the suffrage.  The German voting system is the freest in the world, much freer than the  French, English, or American system, because not only does it operate in  accordance with the principle that every one shall have a direct and  secret vote, but the powers of the State are exercised faithfully and  conscientiously to carry out that principle in practice. The  constitutional life of the German Nation is of a thoroughly democratic  character.    Those who know that were not surprised that our Social Democrats marched  to war with such enthusiasm. Already among their ranks many have fallen  as heroes, never to be forgotten by any German when his thoughts turn to  the noble blood which has saturated foreign soil--thank God, foreign  soil! Many of the Socialist leaders and adherents are wearing the Iron  Cross, that simple token that seems to tell you when you speak of its  bearer, \"Now, this is a fearless and faithful soul.\"    Let it be said once and for all: He who wants to understand us must  accept our conception that constitutionally we enjoy so great a  political freedom that we would not change with any country in the  world. Everybody in America knows that our manners and customs have been  democratic for centuries, while in France and England they have been  ever aristocratic. Americans, we know, always feel at home on German  soil.    But the Kaiser, you will say, speaks of \"his monarchy,\" therefore must  the Germans be Fuerstenknechte, (servants of Princes.)    First of all, as to the phrase \"Fuerstenknechte.\" Does not the King of  England speak of his \"subjects\"? That word irritates a German, because  he is conscious that he is not a subject, but a citizen of the empire.  Yet he will not infer from the English King's use of the term"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#9)"],[1," Scharnhorst caught fire forward, but not seriously, and her fire  slackened perceptibly; the Gneisenau was badly hit by the Inflexible.    At 3:30 P.M. the Scharnhorst led around about ten points to starboard;  just previously her fire had slackened perceptibly, and one shell had  shot away her third funnel; some guns were not firing, and it would  appear that the turn was dictated by a desire to bring her starboard  guns into action. The effect of the fire on the Scharnhorst became more  and more apparent in consequence of smoke from fires, and also escaping  steam. At times a shell would cause a large hole to appear in her side,  through which could be seen a dull red glow of flame. At 4:04 P.M. the  Scharnhorst, whose flag remained flying to the last, suddenly listed  heavily to port, and within a minute it became clear that she was a  doomed ship, for the list increased very rapidly until she lay on her  beam ends, and at 4:17 P.M. she disappeared.    The Gneisenau passed on the far side of her late flagship, and continued  a determined but ineffectual effort to fight the two battle cruisers.    At 5:08 P.M. the forward funnel was knocked over and remained resting  against the second funnel. She was evidently in serious straits, and her  fire slackened very much.    At 5:15 P.M. one of the Gneisenau's shells struck the Invincible; this  was her last effective effort.    At 5:30 P.M. she turned toward the flagship with a heavy list to  starboard, and appeared stopped, with steam pouring from her escape  pipes and smoke from shell and fires rising everywhere. About this time  I ordered the signal \"Cease fire!\" but before it was hoisted the  Gneisenau opened fire again, and continued to fire from time to time  with a single gun.    At 5:40 P.M. the three ships closed in on the Gneisenau, and at this  time the flag flying at her fore truck was apparently hauled down, but  the flag at the peak continued flying.    At 5:50 P.M. \"Cease fire!\" was made.    At 6 P.M. the Gneisenau heeled over very suddenly, showing the men  gathered on her decks and then walking on her side as she lay for a  minute on her beam ends before sinking.    The prisoners of war from the Gneisenau report that by the time the  ammunition was expended some 600 men had been killed and wounded. The  surviving officers and men were all ordered on deck and told to provide  themselves with hammocks and any articles that could support them in the  water.    When the ship capsized and sank there were probably some 200 unwounded  survivors in the water, but, owing to the shock of the cold water, many  were drowned within sight of the boats and ship.    Every effort was made to save life as quickly as possible, both by boats  and from the ships; lifebuoys were thrown and ropes lowered, but only a  portion could be rescued. The Invincible alone rescued 108 men,  fourteen of whom were found to be dead after being brought on board.  These men were buried at sea the following day with full military  honors.    (C)--ACTION WITH THE LIGHT CRUISERS.    At about 1 P.M., when the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau turned to port to  engage the Invincible and Inflexible, the enemy's light cruisers turned  to starboard to escape; the Dresden was leading and the Nuernberg and  Leipzig followed on each quarter.    In accordance with my instructions, the Glasgow, Kent, and Cornwall at  once went in chase of these ships; the Carnarvon, whose speed was  insufficient to overtake them, closed the battle cruisers.    The Glasgow drew well ahead of the Cornwall and Kent, and at 3 P.M.  shots were exchanged with the Leipzig at 12,000 yards. The Glasgow's  object was to endeavor to outrange the Leipzig with her 6-inch guns and  thus cause her to alter course and give the Cornwall and Kent a chance  of coming into action.    At 4:17 P.M. the Cornwall opened fire, also on the Leipzig.    At 7:17 P.M. the Leipzig was on fire fore and aft, and the Cornwall and  Glasgow ceased fire.    The Leipzig turned over on her port side and disappeared at 9 P.M. Seven  officers and eleven men were saved.    At 3:36 P.M. the Cornwall ordered the Kent to engage the Nuernberg, the  nearest cruiser to her.    Owing to the excellent and strenuous efforts of the engine room  department, the Kent was able to get within range of the Nuernberg at 5  P.M. At 6:35 P.M. the Nuernberg was on fire forward and ceased firing.  The Kent also ceased firing and closed to 3,300 yards; as the colors  were still observed to be flying on the Nuernberg, the Kent opened fire  again. Fire was finally stopped five minutes later on the colors being  hauled down, and every preparation was made to save life. The Nuernberg  sank at 7:27 P.M., and, as she sank, a group of men were waving a German  ensign attached to a staff. Twelve men were rescued, but only seven  survived.    The Kent had four killed and twelve wounded, mostly caused by one shell.    During the time the three cruisers were engaged with the Nuernberg and  Leipzig, the Dresden, which was beyond her consorts, effected her escape  owing to her superior speed. The Glasgow was the only cruiser with  sufficient speed to have had any chance of success. However, she was  fully employed in engaging the Leipzig for over an hour before either  the Cornwall or Kent could come up and get within range. During this  time the Dresden was able to increase her distance and get out of sight.    The weather changed after 4 P.M., and the visibility was much reduced;  further, the sky was overcast and cloudy, thus assisting the Dresden to  get away unobserved.    (D)--ACTION WITH THE ENEMY'S TRANSPORTS.    A report was received at 11:27 A.M. from H.M.S. Bristol that three ships  of the enemy, probably transports or colliers, had appeared off Port  Pleasant. The Bristol was ordered to take the Macedonia under his orders  and destroy the transports.    H.M.S. Macedonia reports that only two ships, steamships Baden and Santa  Isabel, were present; both ships were sunk after the removal of the  crews.    I have pleasure in reporting that the officers and men under my orders  carried out their duties with admirable efficiency and coolness, and  great credit is due to the engineer officers of all the ships, several  of which exceeded their normal full speed.

It  should be understood that the narrative is made purely from the French  standpoint. The additional installment of the document dealing with the  victory of the Marne, Sept. 6th to 15th, is as follows:_    If one examines on the map the respective positions of the German and  French armies on Sept. 6 as previously described, it will be seen that  by his inflection toward Meaux and Coulommiers General von Kluck was  exposing his right to the offensive action of our left. This is the  starting point of the victory of the Marne.    On the evening of Sept. 5 our left army had reached the front  Penchard-Saint-Souflet-Ver. On the 6th and 7th it continued its  attacks vigorously with the Ourcq as objective. On the evening of  the 7th it was some kilometers from the Ourcq, on the front  Chambry-"]]]
