This belief of the bergers respecting the cows is  supported by several circumstantial and apparently trustworthy accounts  of fearful fights among herds of cattle over the grave of some of the  herd. The sight of a companion's blood is said to have a similar effect  upon them. Thus a small pasturage between Anzeindaz and the Col de  Cheville, on the border of the cantons Vaud and Valais, is still called  _Boulaire_ from legendary times, when the herdsmen of Vaud (then Berne)  won back from certain Valaisan thieves the cattle the latter were  carrying off from La Varraz. Some of the cows were wounded in the  battle, and the sight of their blood drove the others mad, so that they  fought till almost all the herd was destroyed; whence the name  Boulaire, from _eboueler_, to disembowel,--a word formed from _boue_,  the patois for _boyau_.    When we left the lower darkness and ascended to the floor of ice once  more, Mignot expressed a desire to see my attempt at a sketch of the  glaciere from that point, as he had been much struck during his  negotiatory visit of the night before by the sketch of the entrance to  the Glaciere of S. Georges, chiefly because he had guessed what it was  meant for. He was evidently disappointed with the representation of his  own cave, for he could see nothing but a network of lines, with  unintelligible words written here and there, and after some hesitation  he confessed that it was not the least like it. A little explanation  soon set that right, and then he began to plead vigorously for the wall  which surrounded the trees at the mouth of the pit. Why was it not put  in? He was told, because it could not be seen from below; but  nevertheless he strongly urged its introduction, on the ground that he  had built it himself, and it was such a well-built wall; facts which far  more than balanced any little impossibility that might otherwise have  prevented its appearance. After we had reached the grass of the outer  world again, he made me sketch the entrance to the pit, pointing to the  containing wall with parental pride, and standing over the sketch-book  and the sketcher with an umbrella which speedily turned inside out  under the combined pressure of wind, and rain, and years; a feat which  it had already performed _des fois_, he said, in the course of his  acquaintance with it.    Before finally leaving the glaciere, I examined the structure of the  great stream of ice, at different points near the top of the limiting  wall. From its outward appearance it might have been expected to be  rough, but it was not so; it was knotty to the eye, but perfectly smooth  to the foot, and, when cut, showed itself perfectly clear and limpid. It  did not separate under the axe into misshapen pieces, with faces of  every possible variation from regularity, that is, with what is called  vitreous fracture, but rather separated into a number of nuts of limpid  ice, each being of a prismatic form, and of much regularity in shape and  size. It was smooth, dark-grey, and clear; free from air, and free from  surface lines; very hard, and suggesting the idea of coarse internal  granulation. In the large ice-streams of some darker glacieres, this ice  assumed a rather lighter colour by candle-light, but always presented  the same granular appearance, and cut up into the same prismatic nuts,  and was evidently free from constitutional opacity.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 18: _Sancti Liberii locus_, the Swiss Dryasdust explains.  There is nothing to connect any known S. Liberius with this  neighbourhood, unless it be the Armenian prince who secretly left his  father's court for Jerusalem, and was sought for throughout Burgundy and  other countries. It seems that Saint Oliver is merely a corruption of S.  Liberius, the Italian form of the latter, Santo Liverio, having become  Sant-Oliverio, as S. Otho became in another country Sant Odo, and thence  San Todo, thus creating a new Saint, S. Todus.--Act SS. May 27.]    [Footnote 19: My sisters made a two-days' excursion from Arzier to this  glaciere in the autumn of 1862, and found no snow in the bottom of the  pit. They took the route by Gimel to Biere, intending to defer the visit  to the glaciere to the morning of the second day; but being warned by  the appearance known locally as _le sappeur qui fume_, a vaporous cloud  at the mouth of a cavern near the Dent d'Oche, on the other side of the  Lake of Geneva, they caught the communal forester at once, and put  themselves under his guidance. The distance from Biere is two hours'  good walking, and an hour and a half for the return. There was no ladder  for the final descent, and the neighbouring chalet could provide nothing  longer than 15 feet, the drop being 30 feet. Two Frenchmen had attempted  to make their way to the cave a week before; but the old 30-foot ladder  of the previous year broke under the foremost of them, and he fell into  the pit, whence he was drawn up by means of a cord composed of  rack-ropes from the chalet, tied together. However useful a string of  cow-ties may be for rescuing a man from such a situation, A. and M. did  not care to make use of that apparatus for a voluntary descent, so they  were perforce contented with a distant view of the ice from the lower  edge of the pit.]    [Footnote 20: See the section of this cave and pit on page 41.]             *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER IV.    THE UPPER GLACIERE OF THE PRE DE S. LIVRES.      We now put ourselves under the guidance of the accomplice, Louis, who  began to express doubts of his ability to find the upper glaciere,  administering consolation by reminding us that if he could not find it  no one else could.    As we walked on through the mist and rain, it became necessary to  circumvent a fierce-looking bull, and Mignot and the accomplice told  rival tales of the dangers to which pedestrians are exposed from the  violence of the cattle on some montagnes, where the bulls are allowed  to grow to full size and fierceness. Mignot was quite motherly in his  advice and his cautions, recommending as the surest safeguard a  pocket-pistol, loaded with powder only, to be flashed in the bull's  face as he makes his charge. When informed that in England an umbrella  or a parasol is found to answer this purpose, he shook his head  negatively, evidently having no confidence in his own umbrella, and  doubting its obeying his wishes at the critical moment; indeed, it  would require a considerable time, and much care and labour, to unfurl  a lumbering instrument of that description. He had the best of the  tale-contest with Renaud in the end, for he had himself been grazed by  a bull which came up with him at the moment when he sprang into a  tree.    Before very long we reached a little kennel-like hut of boughs, which no  decent dog would have lived in, and no large dog could have entered, and  from this we drew a charcoal-burner. No, he said, he did not know the  glaciere; he had heard that one had been discovered near there, and he  had spent hours in searching for it without success. A herdsman on his  way from one pasturage to another could give no better help, and we  began to despair, till at length Louis desired us to halt in a place  sheltered from the rain, while he prosecuted the search alone. We had  abundant time for observing that, like other leafy places sheltered from  the rain, our resting-place was commanded by huge and frequent drops of  water; but at last a joyful _Jodel_ announced the success of the  accomplice, and we ran off to join him.    At first sight there was very little to see. Louis had lately been  enunciating an opinion that the cave was not worth visiting, and I now  felt inclined to agree with him. The general plan appeared to be much  the same as in the one we had just left, but the scale was  considerably smaller. The pit was not nearly so deep or so large, and,  owing to the falling-in of rock and earth at one side, the snow was  approached by a winding path with a gradual fall. As soon as the snow  was reached, the slope became very steep, and led promptly to an arch  in the rock, where the stream of ice began. The cave being shallow,  the stream soon came to an end, and, unlike that in the lower  glaciere, it filled the cave down to the terminal wall, and did not  fill it up to the left wall. Here the ground of the cave was visible,  strewn with the remains of columns, and showing the thickness of the  bottom of the stream to be about 6 feet only. The arch of entrance had  evidently been almost closed by a succession of large columns, but  these had succumbed to the rain and heat to which they had been  exposed by their position.    The left side of the cave, in descending, that is the west side, was  comparatively light, being in the line from the arch; but the other side  was quite dark, and after a time we found that the ice-stream, instead  of terminating as we had supposed with the wall of rock at the end of  the cavern, turned off to the right, and was lost in the darkness. Of  course candles were brought out, though Louis assured us that he had  explored this part of the cave on his previous visit, and had found that  the right wall of the cave very soon stopped the stream: we, on the  contrary, by tying a candle to a long stick, and thrusting it down the  slope of ice, found that the stream passed down extremely steeply, and  poured under a narrow and low arch in the wall of the cave, beyond  which nothing could be seen. We despatched pieces of ice along the  slope, and could hear them whizzing on after they had passed the arch, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#9)"],[1,"lofty Caesar, seeking to put an end to his toils,  in the Pierian grotto, as soon as he had distributed in towns his  troops, wearied by campaigning: you administer [to him] moderate  counsel, and graciously rejoice at it when administered. We are aware  how he, who rules the inactive earth and the stormy main, the cities  also, and the dreary realms [of hell], and alone governs with a  righteous sway both gods and the human multitude, how he took off the  impious Titans and the gigantic troop by his falling thunderbolts. That  horrid youth, trusting to the strength of their arms, and the brethren  proceeding to place Pelion upon shady Olympus, had brought great dread  [even] upon Jove. But what could Typhoeus, and the strong Mimas, or what  Porphyrion with his menacing statue; what Rhoetus, and Enceladus, a  fierce darter with trees uptorn, avail, though rushing violently against  the sounding shield of Pallas? At one part stood the eager Vulcan, at  another the matron Juno, and he, who is never desirous to lay aside his  bow from his shoulders, Apollo, the god of Delos and Patara, who bathes  his flowing hair in the pure dew of Castalia, and possesses the groves  of Lycia and his native wood. Force, void of conduct, falls by its own  weight; moreover, the gods promote discreet force to further advantage;  but the same beings detest forces, that meditate every kind of impiety.  The hundred-handed Gyges is an evidence of the sentiments I allege: and  Orion, the tempter of the spotless Diana, destroyed by a virgin dart.  The earth, heaped over her own monsters, grieves and laments her  offspring, sent to murky Hades by a thunderbolt; nor does the active  fire consume Aetna that is placed over it, nor does the vulture desert  the liver of incontinent Tityus, being stationed there as an avenger of  his baseness; and three hundred chains confine the amorous Pirithous.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE V.    ON THE RECOVERY OF THE STANDARDS FROM PHRAATES.      We believe from his thundering that Jupiter has dominion in the heavens:  Augustus shall be esteemed a present deity the Britons and terrible  Parthians being added to the empire. What! has any soldier of Crassus  lived, a degraded husband with a barbarian wife? And has (O [corrupted]  senate, and degenerate morals!) the Marsian and Apulian, unmindful of  the sacred bucklers, of the [Roman] name and gown, and of eternal Vesta,  grown old in the lands of hostile fathers-in-law, Jupiter and the city  being in safety? The prudent mind of Regulus had provided against this,  dissenting from ignominious terms, and inferring from such a precedent  destruction to the succeeding age, if the captive youth were not to  perish unpitied. I have beheld, said he, the Roman standards affixed to  the Carthaginian temples, and their arms taken away from our soldiers  without bloodshed. I have beheld the arms of our citizens bound behind  their free-born backs, and the gates [of the enemy] unshut, and the  fields, which were depopulated by our battles, cultivated anew. The  soldier, to be sure, ransomed by gold, will return a braver  fellow!--No--you add loss to infamy; [for] neither does the wool once  stained by the dye of the sea-weed ever resume its lost color; nor does  genuine valor, when once it has failed, care to resume its place in  those who have degenerated through cowardice. If the hind, disentangled  from the thickset toils, ever fights, then indeed shall he be valorous,  who has intrusted himself to faithless foes; and he shall trample upon  the Carthaginians in a second war, who dastardly has felt the thongs  with his arms tied behind him, and has been afraid of death. He, knowing  no other way to preserve his life, has confounded peace with war. O  scandal! O mighty Carthage, elevated to a higher pitch by Italy's  disgraceful downfall! He _(Regulus)_ is reported to have rejected the  embrace of his virtuous wife and his little sons like one degraded; and  to have sternly fixed his manly countenance on the ground, until, as an  adviser, by his counsel he confirmed the wavering senators, and amid his  weeping friends hastened away, a glorious exile. Notwithstanding he knew  what the barbarian executioner was providing for him, yet he pushed from  his opposing kindred and the populace retarding his return, in no other  manner, than if (after he had quitted the tedious business of his  clients, by determining their suit) he was only going to the Venafrian  plains, or the Lacedaemonian Tarentum.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VI.    TO THE ROMANS.      Thou shalt atone, O Roman, for the sins of your ancestors, though  innocent, till you shall have repaired the temples and tottering shrines  of the gods, and their statues, defiled with sooty smoke. Thou boldest  sway, because thou bearest thyself subordinate to the gods; to this  source refer every undertaking; to this, every event. The gods, because  neglected, have inflicted many evils on calamitous Italy. Already has  Monaeses, and the band of Pacorus, twice repelled our inauspicious  attacks, and exults in having added the Roman spoils to their trivial  collars. The Dacian and Ethiopian have almost demolished the city  engaged in civil broils, the one formidable for his fleet, the other  more expert for missile arrows. The times, fertile in wickedness, have  in the first place polluted the marriage state, and [thence] the issue  and families. From this fountain perdition being derived, has  overwhelmed the nation and people. The marriageable virgin delights to  be taught the Ionic dances, and even at this time is trained up in  [seductive] arts, and cherishes unchaste desires from her very infancy.  Soon after she courts younger debauchees when her husband is in his  cups, nor has she any choice, to whom she shall privately grant her  forbidden pleasures when the lights are removed, but at the word of  command, openly, not without the knowledge of her husband, she will come  forth, whether it be a factor that calls for her, or the captain of a  Spanish ship, the extravagant purchaser of her disgrace. It was not a  youth born from parents like these, that stained the sea with  Carthaginian gore, and slew Pyrrhus, and mighty Antiochus, and terrific  Annibal; but a manly progeny of rustic soldiers, instructed to turn the  glebe with Sabine spades, and to carry clubs cut [out of the woods] at  the pleasure of a rigid mother, what time the sun shifted the shadows of  the mountains, and took the yokes from the wearied oxen, bringing on the  pleasant hour with his retreating chariot. What does not wasting time  destroy? The age of our fathers, worse than our grandsires, produced us  still more flagitious, us, who are about to product am offspring more  vicious [even than ourselves].           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VII.    TO ASTERIE.      Why, O Asterie, do you weep for Gyges, a youth of inviolable constancy,  whom the kindly zephyrs will restore to you in the beginning of the  Spring, enriched with a Bithynian cargo? Driven as far as Oricum by the  southern winds, after [the rising] of the Goat's tempestuous  constellation, he sleepless passes the cold nights in abundant weeping  [for you]; but the agent of his anxious landlady slyly tempts him by a  thousand methods, informing him that [his mistress], Chloe, is sighing  for him, and burns with the same love that thou hast for him. He  remonstrates with him how a perfidious woman urged the credulous  Proetus, by false accusations, to hasten the death of the over-chaste  Bellerophon. He tells how Peleus was like to have been given up to the  infernal regions, while out of temperance he avoided the Magnesian  Hippolyte: and the deceiver quotes histories to him, that are lessons  for sinning. In vain; for, heart-whole as yet, he receives his words  deafer than the Icarian rocks. But with regard to you, have a care lest  your neighbor Enipeus prove too pleasing. Though no other person equally  skillful to guide the steed, is conspicuous in the course, nor does any  one with equal swiftness swim down the Etrurian stream, yet secure your  house at the very approach of night, nor look down into the streets at  the sound of the doleful pipe; and remain inflexible toward him, though  he often upbraid thee with cruelty.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VIII.    TO MAECENAS.      O Maecenas, learned in both languages, you wonder what I, a single man,  have to do on the calends of March; what these flowers mean, and the  censer replete with frankincense, and the coals laid upon the live turf.  I made a vow of a joyous banquet, and a white goat to Bacchus, after  having been at the point of death by a blow from a tree. This day,  sacred in the revolving year, shall remove the cork fastened with pitch  from that jar, which was set to inhale the smoke in the consulship of  Tullus. Take, my Maecenas, a hundred cups on account of the safety of  your friend, and continue the wakeful lamps even to day-light: all  clamor and passion be far away. Postpone your political cares with  regard to the state: the army of the Dacian Cotison is defeated; the  troublesome Mede is quarreling with himself in a horrible [civil] war:  the Cantabrian, our old enemy on the Spanish coast, is subject to us,  though conquered by a long-disputed victory: now, too, the Scythians are  preparing to quit the field with their imbent bows. Neglectful, as a  private person, forbear to be too solicitous lest the community in any  wise suffer, and joyfully seize the boons of the present hour, and quit  serious affairs.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE IX.
