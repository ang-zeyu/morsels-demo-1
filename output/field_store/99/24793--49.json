Trowth, they had muckle for to blame!       'Twas neither broken wing nor limb,       But twa-three draps about the wame,       Scarce thro' the feathers;       An' baith a yellow George to claim,       An' thole their blethers!

A Poet's Welcome To His Love-Begotten Daughter^1         [Footnote 1: Burns never published this poem.]         The First Instance That Entitled Him To       The Venerable Appellation Of Father           Thou's welcome, wean; mishanter fa' me,       If thoughts o' thee, or yet thy mamie,       Shall ever daunton me or awe me,       My bonie lady,       Or if I blush when thou shalt ca' me       Tyta or daddie.         Tho' now they ca' me fornicator,       An' tease my name in kintry clatter,       The mair they talk, I'm kent the better,       E'en let them clash;       An auld wife's tongue's a feckless matter       To gie ane fash.         Welcome! my bonie, sweet, wee dochter,       Tho' ye come here a wee unsought for,       And tho' your comin' I hae fought for,       Baith kirk and queir;       Yet, by my faith, ye're no unwrought for,       That I shall swear!         Wee image o' my bonie Betty,       As fatherly I kiss and daut thee,       As dear, and near my heart I set thee       Wi' as gude will       As a' the priests had seen me get thee       That's out o' hell.         Sweet fruit o' mony a merry dint,       My funny toil is now a' tint,       Sin' thou came to the warl' asklent,       Which fools may scoff at;       In my last plack thy part's be in't       The better ha'f o't.         Tho' I should be the waur bestead,       Thou's be as braw and bienly clad,       And thy young years as nicely bred       Wi' education,       As ony brat o' wedlock's bed,       In a' thy station.         Lord grant that thou may aye inherit       Thy mither's person, grace, an' merit,       An' thy poor, worthless daddy's spirit,       Without his failins,       'Twill please me mair to see thee heir it,       Than stockit mailens.         For if thou be what I wad hae thee,       And tak the counsel I shall gie thee,       I'll never rue my trouble wi' thee,       The cost nor shame o't,       But be a loving father to thee,       And brag the name o't.          Song--O Leave Novels^1         [Footnote 1: Burns never published this poem.]         O leave novels, ye Mauchline belles,       Ye're safer at your spinning-wheel;       Such witching books are baited hooks       For rakish rooks, like Rob Mossgiel;       Your fine Tom Jones and Grandisons,       They make your youthful fancies reel;       They heat your brains, and fire your veins,       And then you're prey for Rob Mossgiel.         Beware a tongue that's smoothly hung,       A heart that warmly seems to feel;       That feeling heart but acts a part--       'Tis rakish art in Rob Mossgiel.       The frank address, the soft caress,       Are worse than poisoned darts of steel;       The frank address, and politesse,       Are all finesse in Rob Mossgiel.          Fragment--The Mauchline Lady         Tune--\"I had a horse, I had nae mair.\"           When first I came to Stewart Kyle,       My mind it was na steady;       Where'er I gaed, where'er I rade,       A mistress still I had aye.         But when I came roun' by Mauchline toun,       Not dreadin anybody,       My heart was caught, before I thought,       And by a Mauchline lady.          Fragment--My Girl She's Airy         Tune--\"Black Jock.\"           My girl she's airy, she's buxom and gay;       Her breath is as sweet as the blossoms in May;       A touch of her lips it ravishes quite:       She's always good natur'd, good humour'd, and free;       She dances, she glances, she smiles upon me;       I never am happy when out of her sight.          The Belles Of Mauchline         In Mauchline there dwells six proper young belles,       The pride of the place and its neighbourhood a';       Their carriage and dress, a stranger would guess,       In Lon'on or Paris, they'd gotten it a'.         Miss Miller is fine, Miss Markland's divine,       Miss Smith she has wit, and Miss Betty is braw:       There's beauty and fortune to get wi' Miss Morton,       But Armour's the jewel for me o' them a'.          Epitaph On A Noisy Polemic         Below thir stanes lie Jamie's banes;       O Death, it's my opinion,       Thou ne'er took such a bleth'rin bitch       Into thy dark dominion!          Epitaph On A Henpecked Country Squire         As father Adam first was fool'd,       (A case that's still too common,)       Here lies man a woman ruled,       The devil ruled the woman.          Epigram On The Said Occasion         O Death, had'st thou but spar'd his life,       Whom we this day lament,       We freely wad exchanged the wife,       And a' been weel content.         Ev'n as he is, cauld in his graff,       The swap we yet will do't;       Tak thou the carlin's carcase aff,       Thou'se get the saul o'boot.          Another         One Queen Artemisia, as old stories tell,       When deprived of her husband she loved so well,       In respect for the love and affection he show'd her,       She reduc'd him to dust and she drank up the powder.       But Queen Netherplace, of a diff'rent complexion,       When called on to order the fun'ral direction,       Would have eat her dead lord, on a slender pretence,       Not to show her respect, but--to save the expense!          On Tam The Chapman         As Tam the chapman on a day,       Wi'Death forgather'd by the way,       Weel pleas'd, he greets a wight so famous,       And Death was nae less pleas'd wi' Thomas,       Wha cheerfully lays down his pack,       And there blaws up a hearty crack:       His social, friendly, honest heart       Sae tickled Death, they could na part;       Sae, after viewing knives and garters,       Death taks him hame to gie him quarters.          Epitaph On John Rankine         Ae day, as Death, that gruesome carl,       Was driving to the tither warl'       A mixtie--maxtie motley squad,       And mony a guilt-bespotted lad--       Black gowns of each denomination,       And thieves of every rank and station,       From him that wears the star and garter,       To him that wintles in a halter:       Ashamed himself to see the wretches,       He mutters, glowrin at the bitches,         \"By God I'll not be seen behint them,       Nor 'mang the sp'ritual core present them,       Without, at least, ae honest man,       To grace this damn'd infernal clan!\"       By Adamhill a glance he threw,       \"Lord God!\" quoth he, \"I have it now;       There's just the man I want, i' faith!\"       And quickly stoppit Rankine's breath.          Lines On The Author's Death         Written With The Supposed View Of       Being Handed To Rankine After The Poet's Interment           He who of Rankine sang, lies stiff and dead,       And a green grassy hillock hides his head;       Alas! alas! a devilish change indeed.          Man Was Made To Mourn: A Dirge         When chill November's surly blast       Made fields and forests bare,       One ev'ning, as I wander'd forth       Along the banks of Ayr,       I spied a man, whose aged step       Seem'd weary, worn with care;       His face furrow'd o'er with years,       And hoary was his hair.         \"Young stranger, whither wand'rest thou?\"       Began the rev'rend sage;       \"Does thirst of wealth thy step constrain,       Or youthful pleasure's rage?       Or haply, prest with cares and woes,       Too soon thou hast began       To wander forth, with me to mourn       The miseries of man.         \"The sun that overhangs yon moors,       Out-spreading far and wide,       Where hundreds labour to support       A haughty lordling's pride;--       I've seen yon weary winter-sun       Twice forty times return;       And ev'ry time has added proofs,       That man was made to mourn.         \"O man! while in thy early years,       How prodigal of time!       Mis-spending all thy precious hours--       Thy glorious, youthful prime!       Alternate follies take the sway;       Licentious passions burn;       Which tenfold force gives Nature's law.       That man was made to mourn.         \"Look not alone on youthful prime,       Or manhood's active might;       Man then is useful to his kind,       Supported in his right:       But see him on the edge of life,       With cares and sorrows worn;       Then Age and Want--oh! ill-match'd pair--       Shew man was made to mourn.         \"A few seem favourites of fate,       In pleasure's lap carest;       Yet, think not all the rich and great       Are likewise truly blest:       But oh! what crowds in ev'ry land,       All wretched and forlorn,       Thro' weary life this lesson learn,       That man was made to mourn.         \"Many and sharp the num'rous ills       Inwoven with our frame!       More pointed still we make ourselves,       Regret, remorse, and shame!       And man, whose heav'n-erected face       The smiles of love adorn,--       Man's inhumanity to man       Makes countless thousands mourn!         \"See yonder poor, o'erlabour'd wight,       So abject, mean, and vile,       Who begs a brother of the earth       To give him leave to toil;       And see his lordly fellow-worm       The poor petition spurn,       Unmindful, tho' a weeping wife       And helpless offspring mourn.         \"If I'm design'd yon lordling's slave,       By Nature's law design'd,       Why was an independent wish       E'er planted in my mind?       If not, why am I subject to       His cruelty, or scorn?       Or why has man the will and pow'r       To make his fellow mourn?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12797"],[0,"The Log of a Cowboy: A Narrative of the Old Trail Days (#9)"],[1,"as we needed was growing daily  more difficult to find. The first week after leaving San Antonio, our  foreman scouted in quest of water a full day in advance of the herd.  One evening he returned to us with the news that we were in for a dry  drive, for after passing the next chain of lakes it was sixty miles to  the next water, and reports regarding the water supply even after  crossing this arid stretch were very conflicting.    \"While I know every foot of this trail through here,\" said the  foreman, \"there's several things that look scaly. There are only five  herds ahead of us, and the first three went through the old route, but  the last two, after passing Indian Lakes, for some reason or other  turned and went westward. These last herds may be stock cattle,  pushing out west to new ranges; but I don't like the outlook. It would  take me two days to ride across and back, and by that time we could be  two thirds of the way through. I've made this drive before without a  drop of water on the way, and wouldn't dread it now, if there was any  certainty of water at the other end. I reckon there's nothing to do  but tackle her; but isn't this a hell of a country? I've ridden fifty  miles to-day and never saw a soul.\"    The Indian Lakes, some seven in number, were natural reservoirs with  rocky bottoms, and about a mile apart. We watered at ten o'clock the  next day, and by night camped fifteen miles on our way. There was  plenty of good grazing for the cattle and horses, and no trouble was  experienced the first night. McCann had filled an extra twenty gallon  keg for this trip. Water was too precious an article to be lavish  with, so we shook the dust from our clothing and went unwashed. This  was no serious deprivation, and no one could be critical of another,  for we were all equally dusty and dirty.    The next morning by daybreak the cattle were thrown off the bed ground  and started grazing before the sun could dry out what little moisture  the grass had absorbed during the night. The heat of the past week had  been very oppressive, and in order to avoid it as much as possible, we  made late and early drives. Before the wagon passed the herd during  the morning drive, what few canteens we had were filled with water for  the men. The _remuda_ was kept with the herd, and four changes of  mounts were made during the day, in order not to exhaust any one  horse. Several times for an hour or more, the herd was allowed to lie  down and rest; but by the middle of the afternoon thirst made them  impatient and restless, and the point men were compelled to ride  steadily in the lead in order to hold the cattle to a walk. A number  of times during the afternoon we attempted to graze them, but not  until the twilight of evening was it possible.    After the fourth change of horses was made, Honeyman pushed on ahead  with the saddle stock and overtook the wagon. Under Flood's orders he  was to tie up all the night horses, for if the cattle could be induced  to graze, we would not bed them down before ten that night, and all  hands would be required with the herd. McCann had instructions to make  camp on the divide, which was known to be twenty-five miles from our  camp of the night before, or forty miles from the Indian Lakes. As we  expected, the cattle grazed willingly after nightfall, and with a fair  moon, we allowed them to scatter freely while grazing forward. The  beacon of McCann's fire on the divide was in sight over an hour before  the herd grazed up to camp, all hands remaining to bed the thirsty  cattle. The herd was given triple the amount of space usually required  for bedding, and even then for nearly an hour scarcely half of them  lay down.    We were handling the cattle as humanely as possible under the  circumstances. The guards for the night were doubled, six men on the  first half and the same on the latter, Bob Blades being detailed to  assist Honeyman in night-herding the saddle horses. If any of us got  more than an hour's sleep that night, he was lucky. Flood, McCann, and  the horse wranglers did not even try to rest. To those of us who could  find time to eat, our cook kept open house. Our foreman knew that a  well-fed man can stand an incredible amount of hardship, and  appreciated the fact that on the trail a good cook is a valuable  asset. Our outfit therefore was cheerful to a man, and jokes and songs  helped to while away the weary hours of the night.    The second guard, under Flood, pushed the cattle off their beds an  hour before dawn, and before they were relieved had urged the herd  more than five miles on the third day's drive over this waterless  mesa. In spite of our economy of water, after breakfast on this third  morning there was scarcely enough left to fill the canteens for the  day. In view of this, we could promise ourselves no midday  meal--except a can of tomatoes to the man; so the wagon was ordered to  drive through to the expected water ahead, while the saddle horses  were held available as on the day before for frequent changing of  mounts. The day turned out to be one of torrid heat, and before the  middle of the forenoon, the cattle lolled their tongues in despair,  while their sullen lowing surged through from rear to lead and back  again in piteous yet ominous appeal. The only relief we could offer  was to travel them slowly, as they spurned every opportunity offered  them either to graze or to lie down.    It was nearly noon when we reached the last divide, and sighted the  scattering timber of the expected watercourse. The enforced order of  the day before--to hold the herd in a walk and prevent exertion and  heating--now required four men in the lead, while the rear followed  over a mile behind, dogged and sullen. Near the middle of the  afternoon, McCann returned on one of his mules with the word that it  was a question if there was water enough to water even the horse  stock. The preceding outfit, so he reported, had dug a shallow well in  the bed of the creek, from which he had filled his kegs, but the stock  water was a mere loblolly. On receipt of this news, we changed mounts  for the fifth time that day; and Flood, taking Forrest, the cook, and  the horse wrangler, pushed on ahead with the _remuda_ to the waterless  stream.    The outlook was anything but encouraging. Flood and Forrest scouted  the creek up and down for ten miles in a fruitless search for water.  The outfit held the herd back until the twilight of evening, when  Flood returned and confirmed McCann's report. It was twenty miles yet  to the next water ahead, and if the horse stock could only be watered  thoroughly, Flood was determined to make the attempt to nurse the herd  through to water. McCann was digging an extra well, and he expressed  the belief that by hollowing out a number of holes, enough water could  be secured for the saddle stock. Honeyman had corralled the horses and  was letting only a few go to the water at a time, while the night  horses were being thoroughly watered as fast as the water rose in the  well.    Holding the herd this third night required all hands. Only a few men  at a time were allowed to go into camp and eat, for the herd refused  even to lie down. What few cattle attempted to rest were prevented by  the more restless ones. By spells they would mill, until riders were  sent through the herd at a break-neck pace to break up the groups.  During these milling efforts of the herd, we drifted over a mile from  camp; but by the light of moon and stars and the number of riders,  scattering was prevented. As the horses were loose for the night, we  could not start them on the trail until daybreak gave us a change of  mounts, so we lost the early start of the morning before.    Good cloudy weather would have saved us, but in its stead was a sultry  morning without a breath of air, which bespoke another day of sizzling  heat. We had not been on the trail over two hours before the heat  became almost unbearable to man and beast. Had it not been for the  condition of the herd, all might yet have gone well; but over three  days had now elapsed without water for the cattle, and they became  feverish and ungovernable. The lead cattle turned back several times,  wandering aimlessly in any direction, and it was with considerable  difficulty that the herd could be held on the trail. The rear overtook  the lead, and the cattle gradually lost all semblance of a trail herd.  Our horses were fresh, however, and after about two hours' work, we  once more got the herd strung out in trailing fashion; but before a  mile had been covered, the leaders again turned, and the cattle  congregated into a mass of unmanageable animals, milling and lowing in  their fever and thirst. The milling only intensified their sufferings  from the heat, and the outfit split and quartered them again and  again, in the hope that this unfortunate outbreak might be checked. No  sooner was the milling stopped than they would surge hither and yon,  sometimes half a mile, as ungovernable as the waves of an ocean. After  wasting several hours in this manner, they finally turned back over  the trail, and the utmost efforts of every man in the outfit failed to  check them. We threw our ropes in their faces, and when this failed,  we resorted to shooting; but in defiance of the fusillade and the  smoke they walked sullenly through the line of horsemen across their  front. Six-shooters were discharged so close to the leaders' faces as  to singe their hair, yet, under a noonday sun, they disregarded this  and every other device to turn them, and passed wholly out of our  control. In a number of instances wild steers deliberately walked  against our horses, and then for the first time a fact dawned on us  that chilled the marrow in our bones,--_the herd was going blind_.    The bones of men and animals that lie bleaching along the trails  abundantly testify that this was not the first instance in which the"]]]
