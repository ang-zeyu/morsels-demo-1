My strength is greater than a mountain and my words  are more fearful than a hurricane. This servant of thine cannot  even touch me. With one breath of my mouth I can blow over this  whole palace.    THE KING. Dost thou hear the impudence he is offering me? Why  dost thou not seize him? What is the matter with thee? Why dost  thou not call the guards?    THE BEGGAR. I will not harm thee now. I will only cry aloud in  the streets for bread wherewith to fill my belly. But one day I  will not be so kind to thee. On that day my mouth will be filled  with a rushing wind and my arms will become as strong as steel  rods, and I will blow over this palace, and all the bones in thy  foolish body I will snap between my fingers. I will beat upon a  large drum and thy head will be my drumstick. I will not do these  things now. But one day I will do them. Therefore, when my voice  sounds again in thine ears, begging for bread, remember what I  have told thee. Remember, O king, and be afraid!    (_He walks out. THE SERVANT, struck dumb, stares after him. THE  KING sits in his chair, dazed._)    THE KING (_suddenly collecting his wits_). After him! After him! He  must not be allowed to escape! After him!    THE SERVANT (_faltering_). O king--I cannot seem to move.    THE KING. Quick, then. Call the guards. He must be caught and put  in chains. Quick, I say. Call the guards!    THE SERVANT. O king--I cannot seem to call them.    THE KING. How! Art thou dumb? Ah!    (THE BEGGAR'S _voice is heard outside._)    THE BEGGAR. Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.    THE KING. Ah. (_He turns toward the window, half-frightened, and  then, almost instinctively, raises his hands toward his crown,  and seems on the point of tossing it out the window. But with an  oath he replaces it and presses it firmly on his head._) How! Am I  afraid of a beggar!    THE BEGGAR (_continuing outside_). Bread. Bread. Give me some  bread.    THE KING (_with terrible anger_). Close that window!    (THE SERVANT _stands stupent, and the voice of THE BEGGAR grows  louder as the curtain falls._)          TIDES[1]    George Middleton    [Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission of the author and of Messrs.  Henry Holt and Company, the publishers, from the volume, _Masks  and Other One-Act Plays_ (1920).]    CHARACTERS    WILLIAM WHITE, a famous Internationalist  HILDA, his wife  WALLACE, their son    SCENE: _At the Whites'; spring, 1917. A simply furnished study.  The walls are lined with bookshelves, indicating, by their  improvised quality, that they have been increased as occasion  demanded. On these are stacked, in addition to the books  themselves, many files of papers, magazines, and \"reports.\" The  large work-table, upon which rests a double student lamp and a  telephone, is conspicuous. A leather couch with pillows is  opposite, pointing toward a doorway which leads into the  living-room. There is also a doorway in back, which apparently  opens on the hallway beyond. The room is comfortable in spite of  its general disorder: it is essentially the workshop of a busy  man of public affairs. The strong sunlight of a spring day comes  in through the window, flooding the table._    WILLIAM WHITE _is standing by the window, smoking a pipe. He is  about fifty, of striking appearance: the visual incarnation of  the popular conception of a leader of men. There is authority and  strength in the lines of his face; his whole personality is  commanding; his voice has all the modulations of a well-trained  orator; his gestures are sweeping--for, even in private  conversation, he is habitually conscious of an audience.  Otherwise, he is simple and engaging, with some indication of his  humble origin._    _On the sofa opposite, with a letter in her hand,_ HILDA WHITE, _his  wife, is seated. She is somewhat younger in fact, though in  appearance she is as one who has been worn a bit by the struggle  of many years. Her manner contrasts with her husband's: her  inheritance of delicate refinement is ever present in her soft  voice and gentle gesture. Yet she, too, suggests strength--the  sort which will endure all for a fixed intention._    _It is obvious throughout that she and her husband have been happy  comrades in their life together, and that a deep fundamental bond  has united them in spite of the different social spheres from  which each has sprung._      WHITE (_seeing she has paused_). Go on, dear; go on. Let's hear all  of it.    HILDA. Oh, what's the use, Will? You know how differently he  feels about the war.    WHITE (_with quiet sarcasm_). But it's been so many years since  your respectable brother has honored me even with the slightest  allusion--    HILDA. If you care for what he says--(_continuing to read the  letter_)--\"Remember, Hilda, you are an American. I don't suppose  your husband considers that an honor; but I do.\"    WHITE (_interrupting_). And what kind of an American has he been in  times of peace? He's wrung forty per cent profit out of his  factory and fought every effort of the workers to organize. Ah,  these smug hypocrites!    HILDA (_reading_). \"His violent opposition to America going in has  been disgrace enough--\"    WHITE. But his war profits were all right. Oh, yes.    HILDA. Let me finish, dear, since you want it. (_Reading_) \"--been  disgrace enough. But now that we're in, I'm writing in the faint  hope, if you are not too much under his influence, that you will  persuade him to keep his mouth shut. This country will tolerate  no difference of opinion now. You radicals had better get on  board the band wagon. It's prison or acceptance.\" (_She stops  reading._) He's right, dear. There will be nothing more  intolerant than a so-called democracy at war.    WHITE. By God! It's superb! Silence for twenty years and now he  writes his poor misguided sister for fear she will be further  disgraced by her radical husband.    HILDA. We mustn't descend to his bitterness.    WHITE. No: I suppose I should resuscitate the forgotten doctrine  of forgiving my enemies.    HILDA. He's not your enemy; he merely looks at it all  differently.    WHITE. I was thinking of his calm contempt for me these twenty  years--ever since you married me--\"out of your class,\" as he  called it.    HILDA. Oh, hush, Will. I've been so happy with you I can bear him  no ill will. Besides, doesn't his attitude seem natural? You  mustn't forget that no man in this country has fought his class  more than you. That hurts--especially coming from an _acquired_  relative.    WHITE. Yes; that aggravates the offense. And I'll tell you  something you may not know. (_Bitterly_) Whenever I've spoken  against privilege and wealth it's been his pudgy, comfortable  face I've shaken my fist at. He's been so damned comfortable all  his life.    HILDA. (_She looks at him in surprise._) Why, Will, you surely  don't envy him his comfort, do you? I can't make you out. What's  come over you these last weeks? You've always been above such  personal bitterness; even when you were most condemned and  ridiculed. If it were anybody but you I'd think you had done  something you were ashamed of.    WHITE. What do you mean?    HILDA. Haven't you sometimes noticed that is what bitterness to  another means: a failure within oneself? (_He goes over to chair  and sits without answering._) I can think of you beaten by outside  things--that sort of failure we all meet; but somehow I can never  think of you failing yourself. You've been so brave and  self-reliant: you've fought so hard for the truth.    WHITE (_tapping letter_). But he thinks he knows the truth, too.    HILDA. He's also an intense nature.    WHITE (_thoughtfully after a pause_). Yet there is _some_  truth in what he says.    HILDA (_smiling_). But you didn't like it--coming from him?    WHITE. It will be different with you and me now that America's  gone in.    HILDA. Yes. It will be harder for us here; for hate is always  farthest from the trenches. But you and I are not the sort who  would compromise to escape the persecution which is the resource  of the non-combatant.    (_The phone rings: he looks at his watch._)    WHITE. That's for me.    HILDA. Let me. (_She goes._) It may be Wallace. (_At phone_) Yes:  this is 116 Chelsea. Long Distance? (_He starts as she says to  him_) It must be our boy. (_At phone_) Who? Oh--Mr. William White?  Yes: he'll be here. (_She hangs up receiver._) She'll ring when she  gets the connection through.    WHITE (_turning away_). It takes so long these days.    HILDA. Funny he didn't ask for me.    WHITE. What made you think it was Wallace?    HILDA. I took it for granted. He must be having a hard time at  college with all the boys full of war fever.    WHITE. And a father with my record.    HILDA. He should be proud of the example. He has more than other  boys to cling to these days when everybody is losing his head as  the band plays and the flag is waved. He won't be carried away by  it. He'll remember all we taught him. Ah, Will, when I think we  now have conscription--as they have in Germany--I thank God every  night our boy is too young for the draft.    WHITE. But when his time comes what will he do?    HILDA (_calmly_). He will do it with courage.    WHITE (_referring to her brother's letter_). Either prison or  acceptance!    HILDA. I would rather have my son in prison than have him do what  he felt was wrong. Wouldn't you?    WHITE (_evasively_). We won't have to face that problem for two  years.    HILDA. And when it comes--if he falters--I'll give him these  notes of that wonderful speech you made at the International  Conference in 1910. (_Picking it up_) I was looking through it only  this morning.    WHITE (_troubled_). Oh, that speech.    HILDA (_glancing through it with enthusiasm_). \"All wars are  imperialistic in origin.

Then give it some little vent, else the Barrel would break.  When it is at the end of the working, stop it up close. She useth to make  it at the end of Summer, when she takes up her Honey, and begins to drink  it in Lent. But it will be better if you defer piercing it till next  Winter. When part of the Barrel is drunk, she botteleth the rest, which  maketh it quicker and better. You clear the Decoction from the Herbs by a  Hair-sieve.      SOME NOTES ABOUT HONEY    The Honey of dry open Countries, where there is much Wild-thyme, Rosemary,  and Flowers, is best. It is of three sorts, Virgin-honey, Life-honey, and  Stock-honey. The first is the best. The Life-honey next. The Virgin-honey  is of Bees, that swarmed the Spring before, and are taken up in Autumn; and  is made best by chusing the Whitest combs of the Hive, and then letting the  Honey run out of them lying upon a Sieve without pressing it, or breaking  of the Combs. The Life-honey is of the same Combs broken after the  Virgin-honey is run from it; The Merchants of Honey do use to mingle all  the sorts together. The first of a swarm is called Virgin-honey. That of  the next year, after the Swarm was hatched, is Life-honey. And ever after,  it is Honey of Old-stocks. Honey that is forced out of the Combs, will  always taste of Wax. Hampshire Honey is most esteemed at London. About  Bisleter there is excellent good. Some account Norfolk honey the best.      MR. CORSELLISES ANTWERP MEATH    To make good Meath, good white and thick Marsilian or Provence-honey is  best; and of that, to four Holland Pints (the Holland Pint is very little  bigger then the English Wine-pint:) of Water, you must put two pound of  Honey; The Honey must be stirred in Water, till it be all melted; If it be  stirred about in warm water, it will melt so much the sooner.    When all is dissolved, it must be so strong that an Egge may swim in it  with the end upwards. And if it be too sweet or too strong, because there  is too much Honey; then you must put more water to it; yet so, that, as  above, an Hens Egge may swim with the point upwards: And then that newly  added water must be likewise well stirred about, so that it may be mingled  all alike. If the Eggs sink (which is a token that there is not honey  enough) then you must put more Honey to it, and stir about, till it be all  dissolved, and the Eggs swim, as abovesaid. This being done, it must be  hanged over the fire, and as it beginneth to seeth, the scum, that doth  arise upon it, both before and after, must be clean skimed off. When it is  first set upon the fire, you must measure it first with a stick, how deep  the Kettel is, or how much Liquor there be in it; and then it must boil so  long, till one third part of it be boiled away. When it is thus boiled, it  must be poured out into a Cooler, or open vessel, before it be tunned in  the Barrel; but the Bung-hole must be left open, that it may have vent. A  vessel, which hath served for Sack is best.      TO MAKE EXCELLENT MEATHE    To every quart of Honey, take four quarts of water. Put your water in a  clean Kettle over the fire, and with a stick take the just measure, how  high the water cometh, making a notch, where the superficies toucheth the  stick. As soon as the water is warm, put in your Honey, and let it boil,  skiming it always, till it be very clean; Then put to every Gallon of  water, one pound of the best Blew-raisins of the Sun, first clean picked  from the stalks, and clean washed. Let them remain in the boiling Liquor,  till they be throughly swollen and soft; Then take them out, and put them  into a Hair-bag, and strain all the juice and pulp and substance from them  in an Apothecaries Press; which put back into your liquor, and let it boil,  till it be consumed just to the notch you took at first, for the measure of  your water alone. Then let your Liquor run through a Hair-strainer into an  empty Woodden-fat, which must stand endwise, with the head of the upper-end  out; and there let it remain till the next day, that the liquor be quite  cold. Then Tun it up into a good Barrel, not filled quite full, but within  three or four fingers breadth; (where Sack hath been, is the best) and let  the bung remain open for six weeks with a double bolter-cloth lying upon  it, to keep out any foulness from falling in. Then stop it up close, and  drink not of it till after nine months.    This Meathe is singularly good for a Consumption, Stone, Gravel,  Weak-sight, and many more things. A Chief Burgomaster of Antwerpe, used  for many years to drink no other drink but this; at Meals and all times,  even for pledging of healths. And though He were an old man, he was of an  extraordinary vigor every way, and had every year a Child, had always a  great appetite, and good digestion; and yet was not fat.      A WEAKER, BUT VERY PLEASANT, MEATHE    To every quart of Honey take six of water; boil it till 1/3 be consumed,  skiming it well all the while. Then pour it into an open Fat, and let it  cool. When the heat is well slakened, break into a Bowl-full of this warm  Liquor, a New-laid-egge, beating the yolk and white well with it; then put  it into the Fat to all the rest of the Liquor, and stir it well together,  and it will become very clear. Then pour it into a fit very clean Barrel,  and put to it some Mother of Wine, that is in it's best fermentation or  working, and this will make the Liquor work also. This will be ready to  drink in three or four Months, or sooner.      AN EXCELLENT WHITE MEATHE    Take one Gallon of Honey, and four of water; Boil and scum them till there  rise no more scum; then put in your Spice a little bruised, which is most  of Cinnamon, a little Ginger, a little Mace, and a very little Cloves. Boil  it with the Spice in it, till it bear an Egge. Then take it from the fire,  and let it Cool in a Woodden vessel, till it be but lukewarm; which this  quantity will be in four or five or six hours. Then put into it a hot tost  of White-bread, spread over on both sides, pretty thick with fresh barm;  that will make it presently work. Let it work twelve hours, close covered  with Cloves. Then Tun it into a Runlet wherein Sack hath been, that is  somewhat too big for that quantity of Liquor; for example, that it fill it  not by a Gallon; You may then put a little Limon-pill in with it. After it  hath remained in the vessel a week or ten days, draw it into Bottles. You  may begin to drink it after two or three Months: But it will be better  after a year. It will be very spritely and quick and pleasant and pure  white.      A RECEIPT TO MAKE A TUN OF METHEGLIN    Take two handfuls of Dock (_alias_ wild Carrot) a reasonable burthen of  Saxifrage, Wild-sage, Blew-button, Scabious, Bettony, Agrimony,  Wild-marjoram, of each a reasonable burthen; Wild-thyme a Peck, Roots and  all. All these are to be gathered in the fields, between the two Lady days  in Harvest. The Garden-herbs are these; Bay-leaves, and Rosemary, of each  two handfuls; a Sieveful of Avens, and as much Violet-leaves: A handful of  Sage; three handfuls of Sweet-Marjoram, Three Roots of young Borrage,  leaves and all, that hath not born seed; Two handfuls of Parsley-roots, and  all that hath not born Seed. Two Roots of Elecampane that have not seeded:  Two handfuls of Fennel that hath not seeded: A peck of Thyme; wash and pick  all your herbs from filth and grass: Then put your field herbs first into  the bottom of a clean Furnace, and lay all your Garden-herbs thereon; then  fill your Furnace with clean water, letting your herbs seeth, till they be  so tender, that you may easily slip off the skin of your Field-herbs, and  that you may break the roots of your Garden-herbs between your Fingers.  Then lade forth your Liquor, and set it a cooling. Then fill your Furnace  again with clear water to these Herbs, and let them boil a quarter of an  hour. Then put it to your first Liquor, filling the Furnace, until you have  sufficient to fill your Tun. Then as your Liquor begins to cool, and is  almost cold, set your servants to temper Honey and wax in it, Combs and  all, and let them temper it well together, breaking the Combes very small;  let their hands and nails be very clean; and when you have tempered it very  well together, cleanse it through a cleansing sieve into another clean  vessel; The more Honey you have in your Liquor, the stronger it will be.  Therefore to know, when it is strong enough, take two New-laid eggs, when  you begin to cleanse, and put them in whole into the bottome of your  cleansed Liquor; And if it be strong enough, it will cause the Egge to  ascend upward, and to be on the top as broad as sixpence; if they do not  swim on the top; put more.      THE COUNTESS OF BULLINGBROOK'S WHITE METHEGLIN    Take eight Gallons of Conduit-water, and boil it very well; then put as  much Honey in it, as will bear an Egge, and stir it well together. Then set  it upon the fire, and put in the whites of four Eggs to clarifie it; And as  the scum riseth, take it off clean: Then put in a pretty quantity of  Rosemary, and let it boil, till it tasteth a little of it: Then with a  scummer take out the Rosemary, as fast as you can, and let it boil half a  quarter of an hour; put it into earthen pans to cool; next morning put it  into a barrel, and put into it a little barm, and an Ounce of Ginger  scraped and sliced; And let it stand a Month or six Weeks. Then bottle it  up close; you must be sure not to let it stand at all in Brass.      MR. WEBBES MEATH    Master Webbe, who maketh the Kings Meathe, ordereth it thus. Take as much  of Hyde-park water as will make a Hogshead of Meathe: Boil in it about two  Ounces of the best Hopp's for about half an hour. By that time, the water  will have drawn out the strength of the Hopp's. Then skim them clean "]]]
