These are generally adults with weak digestions, or elderly  persons who, on account of their age and the sluggish action of their  assimilative functions, require comparatively little food. Children, on  account of their vigorous vitality, rapid growth and hearty appetites,  ought not to be restricted to this number. Persons who have got into the  pernicious habit of greatly over-eating, and whose stomachs have become  distended and unusually large, sometimes find it easier to restrict their  daily food to a healthy quantity by taking only two meals. The general  objections against two meals are that either two little food is taken, or  the ingestion of such a large quantity is bad for the stomach and causes  it to press on the adjacent viscera. The large quantity of blood and nerve  force drawn to the over-distended stomach, depletes the brain and nervous  system, causing drowsiness and incapacity for mental and physical work.  The carnivora, whose opportunity for obtaining food--unlike the  herbivora--is irregular and often at long intervals, gorge themselves upon  opportunity and are in the habit of sleeping after a meal. The frugivora  and herbivora, however, are alert and ready to fly from their enemies  should such appear. The conveying of so much nourishment to the liver and  blood stream at one time, is probably a greater tax on them. A light lunch  between the usual full meals has nothing to recommend it. The stomach is  burdened to little purpose, often before it has finished with one meal  another is imposed upon it, no time being left for recuperation.    Dietaries.--The best proportions of proteids, carbo-hydrates and fats  required for the nourishment of the body has not yet been conclusively  decided. The common plan is to average the dietary of large bodies of  persons, particualrly of soldiers and prisoners. These dietaries have been  adjusted empirically (the earlier ones at least), and are generally  considered as satisfactory. They are chiefly of English and German origin.  Another method is to laboriously analyse the injesta or food consumed and  compare it with the dejecta or excretions, until a quantity and kind of  food is found which is just sufficient to keep the body in equilibrium.  This latter plan is the best, but to be quite satisfactory must be tried  on a large number of suitable persons under varying conditions, both of  quantity and kind of food. Nearly all the experiments have been made on  persons accustomed to a stimulating dietary: their usual food has included  a considerable quantity of flesh and alcoholic drinks. Sufficient  attention has not been paid to the dietaries of the more abstemious races  who partake of little if any flesh food. The standard daily dietary for a  man of average weight, doing a moderate amount of work, is variously  stated by the best authorities as proteids from 100 to 130 grammes, fat 35  to 125 grammes, and carbo-hydrates 450 to 550 grammes. There is a  surprising difference of opinion on the amount of fat, but those who give  least fat give the largest quantity of carbo-hydrate and _vice-versa_. Dr.  R. Hutchison in \"Food and Dietetics,\" sums up the quantities given by the  highest authorities as follows:---    Proteid       125 g. ( 4.4 oz.) x 4.1 =  512 cal. = 20 g. N,  62 C  Carbo-hydrate 500 g. (17.6 oz.)   4.1   2050                 200  Fat            50 g. ( 1.8 oz.)   9.3    465                  38                -----------------         ----        -------- -----                 675 g.(23.8    )         3027 Total  20 g. N, 300 C    The nutrient ratio is 1 : 4.9. For scientific purposes, metrical weights  and measures are used, instead of the inconvenient English grains, ounces,  pounds, &c. (1 gramme = 15.43 grains; 1 ounce avoirdupois = 437.5 grains =  28.35 grammes). A calorie is a measure of the power of a food in  generating heat and muscular energy (these two being convertible).    The calories used in food tables are kilo-calories, representing the  amount of heat which would raise a kilogramme (1000 grammes) of water  1 deg. Centigrade. This is the same as raising 1 pound weight 4 deg.  Fahrenheit. According to the table given, 125 grammes of dry proteid are  required per day; this contains 20 grammes of nitrogen and 62 of carbon.  When thoroughly consumed or utilised in the body, the heat or its  equivalent in muscular work equals 512 kilo-calories. Proteids have, of  course, an additional value as tissue formers. The factors used here, of  4.1 and 9.3, are those commonly employed; but the latest and most  reliable research, taking account only of that part of the food which  is actually available in the body, gives for proteid and carbo-hydrate  4 calories, and for fat 8.9 calories.    Fat has a higher food value than the carbo-hydrates, as 4.1 : 9.3 = 2.27  or 4.0 : 89 = 2.225, according to whether the old or new factors are used.  In the table of analyses 2.225 was used. The standard dietary for a woman,  or of a boy 14 to 16 years of age, is given as equivalent to eight-tenths  that of a man; a child of 10 to 13 six-tenths; of 2 to 5 four-tenths. A  man doing hard work requires one-tenth more. The following table gives  three standard dietaries, and a few actual ones, in grammes per day. The  food of persons in easy circumstances, and of working men in the receipt  of good wages, approximate to the standard dietaries, except that the fat  is higher and the carbo-hydrates proportionately less. This is due to an  abundance of animal food. It was thought unnecessary to give them in  detail:--                                                     Pr't. Fat. C'rb. Cal. N.R.

NOTES.--(_a_) The Japanese are of small stature and weight.    (_b_) One of a series of experiments by A.W. Blyth, 1888. 1-1/2 lbs. of  wheatmeal per day was required for equilibrium; sedentary occupation, with  a daily walk of six miles.    (_c_) See \"A Text Book of Physiology,\" by M. Foster, 5th edition, part  ii., p. 839; the diet was bread, fruit and oil. The man was in apparently  good health and stationary weight; only 59 per cent. of the proteids were  digested, leaving the small quantity of 32 grammes available for real use.  In commenting upon this, Professor Foster writes:--\"We cannot  authoritatively say that such a reduction is necessarily an evil; for our  knowledge will not at present permit us to make an authoritative exact  statement as to the extent to which the proteid may be reduced without  disadvantage to the body, when accompanied by adequate provision of the  other elements of food; and this statement holds good whether the body be  undertaking a small or large amount of labour.\"    (_d_) The Miller of Billericay's case is quoted by Dr. Carpenter, and also  by Dr. Pavy. It was reported to the College of Physicians in 1767 by Sir  George Baker. A remarkable degree of vigour is said to have been sustained  for upwards of eighteen years on no other nutriment than 16 oz. of flour,  made into a pudding with water, no other liquid of any kind being taken.    A striking instance of abstemiousness is that of Cornaro, a Venetian  nobleman, who died in the year 1566 at the age of 98. Up to the age of 40  he spent a life of indulgence, eating and drinking to excess. At this  time, having been endowed with a feeble constitution, he was suffering  from dyspepsia, gout, and an almost continual slow fever, with an  intolerable thirst continually hanging upon him. The skill of the best  physicians of Italy was unavailing. At length he completely changed his  habits of diet, and made a complete recovery. At the age of 83 he wrote a  treatise on a \"Sure and certain method of attaining a long and healthful  life.\" He says, what with bread, meat, the yolk of an egg and soup, I ate  as much as weighed 12 ozs., neither more nor less. I drank 14 oz. of wine.  When 78 he was persuaded to increase his food by the addition of 2 oz. per  day, and this nearly proved fatal. He writes that, instead of old age  being one of weakness, infirmity and misery, I find myself to be in the  most pleasant and delightful stage of life. At 83 I am always merry,  maintaining a happy peace in my own mind. A sober life has preserved me in  that sprightliness of thought and gaiety of humour. My teeth are all as  sound as in my youth. He was able to take moderate exercise in riding and  walking at that age. He was very passionate and hasty in his youth. He  wrote other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#9)"],[1," to  Kinshasa where we stop and land. Here as usual the keynote is  development. Roads are being made, avenues of palms, mangoes and pine  apples planted and store houses, factories and plantations constructed.  At the coffee factory here, the beans are extracted from the shells,  sorted into sizes and qualities and packed in bags. Many kinds of coffee  have been planted in the Congo, but none are equal to the wild variety  found in the forest, which is as good as any in the world when properly  made. Near at hand is a brick field, where the bricks are made in metal  moulds, the clay being forced in by long levers. They are not made as  quickly as those fashioned by a machine but the process is a great  improvement on the old-fashioned method of brick making in wooden  moulds. It is already apparent that beer is regarded as a luxury here so  we order some dozens at three francs a bottle and having taken some  photos return to the ship.    On the beach were some fine elephant tusks which have been collected by  the agents of the _Societe Anonyme Belge_. When a native finds a pair of  tusks in the territory of the company, the State takes one as a royalty  and the company buys the other for a certain quantity of cloth. This  only represents a fraction of the value in Europe, but is gladly  accepted by the native who has no use for it except to make war horns.  Indeed in the old days, the chiefs used to form a kind of fence round  their huts by sticking the points in the ground, little thinking that in  another part of the world, not even the millionaire of fiction ever  constructed such an expensive railing. Then the Arab slave raiders came  and stole both the native women and the ivory, so that the white man who  gives beautiful coloured cloth for these useless elephants' tusks is  regarded as a very generous trader. In the afternoon the _Flandre_  continued her journey threading her way between the numerous islands in  Stanley Pool, and finally tied up to the bank of the island of Bamu  which is French territory. This island enjoys the distinction of being  the only one in the Congo which has an owner, for all the rest are  declared to be no man's land by international treaty. It is reputed to  be full of game, and we go ashore to look for it, but return without  seeing anything. As the mosquitoes prevent all sleep in the cabin, we  arrange to make up a bed on deck and obtain a better night's rest, for  it is comparatively cool here in the evening in the open.    I am very anxious to bathe next morning, but the captain strongly  disadvises for the currents are very strong here, and the river is full  of crocodiles. In the midst of breakfast we are startled by the report  that the ship is on fire, and smoke is seen to be issuing from the fore  hatch, under which much of the wood used for fuel is stored. None of the  Europeans however, are more excited than the natives, who, leisurely and  with due deliberation, hand up buckets of water. Nothing indeed could  make a native hurry. The captain seems a trifle upset, and states that  it may be necessary to run on a rock, and thus make a hole in the bows  and flood the hold. This seems to be rather a desperate remedy, but no  one shows the slightest interest. This appeared curious at the time;  since however, it has transpired that fires in the holds are of common  occurrence, and that as the ships are all of iron, they usually burn  themselves out without harming anything. Soon after however, the captain  with an alarmed look, rushes up on deck and said that a terrible crime  or a great mistake had been committed. It appeared that by some error,  our cases of beer and some others belonging to Commandant Sillye had  been left on the beach at Kinshasa. Immediately we anchored last night a  native boatswain, or capita, was sent with six men in a canoe to fetch  them and ought to have returned by midnight. Nothing however, was heard  of the boat until now when the capita appeared and told a harrowing  story. He found the cases all right and started to return across the  river, but as it began to blow hard, he thought it better to make for  land and wait until the morning before trying to find the ship. He  succeeded in landing on the island of Bamu and soon after a white man  appeared with some Senegalese soldiers and demanded to know what was in  the cases. He explained, when the white man fired and killed all the  crew, but he ran away and escaped. The affair seemed serious so Lord  Mountmorres and Commandant Sillye left for Brazzaville to discover the  truth, while I stayed on the ship to superintend the landing of our  cargo if the fire extended.    Soon after the Commandant of the Port of Leopoldville arrived in a  steamer and asked if we wanted assistance as another ship had run on the  rocks higher up and sunk and he was hastening to rescue any possible  survivors. Sunday, July 24th indeed, seemed to be a veritable day of  horrors, but still no one appeared at all excited. By midday the fire in  the forehold was extinguished and thus one danger was removed. Later in  the afternoon just before sunset, an immense flock of ducks and geese  crossed the river, but as they were flying nearly a hundred feet up in  the air, it was impossible to shoot them. Soon after Mountmorres and  Sillye returned and reported they had found all the crew safe, except  one man who had probably deserted and had also brought back the cases of  beer. The white man was a French officer of Customs, who had naturally  thought the crew of the canoe were engaged in smuggling and had fired  blank cartridges to frighten them. So passed an eventful day with much  smoke but little fire. It was indeed becoming apparent that the Congo  was a true land of exaggerations. On all sides were great hills, great  plains, great forests, great rivers, great beasts, great trees, and  great lies.    Next day we continued our course up Stanley-Pool, which meant threading  our way up narrow channels between uninteresting sandbanks covered with  forest or grass. In the distance could be seen the hills forming the  boundaries of the Pool and at its upper end _Dover Cliffs_ so called  from their resemblance to that part of the English coast. About midday  we sighted the _Anversville_, the vessel which was supposed to have been  sunk, comfortably lying on a sand bank, and the _Brugesville_ which had  gone to her assistance, also resting on the same bank. One of the  passengers came off to the _Flandre_ and told us that no one was hurt  and all the baggage was safe and that he had heard we had been burnt  out, attacked by natives and all killed. Truly the Congo is a wonderful  place.    As the _Flandre_ moors we decide to go ashore hunting. Within a few  yards of the bank is the lair of a hippopotamus and the spoor of  elephants. It is however, very difficult walking, for patches of land  are covered with long grass seven or eight feet high and the rest is  bog. After struggling along for a few minutes, I hear a curious noise  like a very asthmatic fog horn not above five yards away. Nothing is  however, visible, for the grass forms a complete cover. Again the grunt  with a suspicious after-sniff and at the same moment Chikaia, who is  carrying my gun snaps his fingers--the usual sign to indicate game--and  beckons me to follow. I endeavour to do so, and at once sink in the bog  up to the knees, but fortunately keep my rifle dry. By clutching the  grass, I get out and we follow the spoor of the hippo as rapidly as  possible. This is very clearly marked, for the grass has been recently  thrust aside and there are great holes in the soft mud over a foot wide  and deep, made by the great feet of the beast. These holes were in pairs  lying close together, showing that the hippo was galloping as he passed  and unfortunately they led straight to the river.    Next day we leave the Pool and enter a part of the river called the  Channel. Here there are no islands and both banks are visible all the  time, the width not being more than a mile in some places. A low range  of hills covered with acacias or coarse grass, exists on each side. As  usual, we stop at a Wood Post to take fuel on board. This is cut in logs  three or four feet long and stacked in heaps about the same in width and  height. Sticks are placed in the ground connected by lines at the  required height and the logs are laid in rows until the space is filled.  The result is a cubic yard of wood known in the Congo as a _bras_, but  the bras differs in size and price considerably, in some cases the cost  being 5 mitakos and in others double that amount. A native can easily  collect a bras of wood in the forest and carry it to the bank in a day  and in some of the Wood Posts fifty or sixty natives are employed. Even  then however, the demand for wood by the big steamers is sometimes  greater than the supply.    At 6 p.m. every day the steamer stops for the night and makes fast to a  tree on the bank. All the native passengers at once go ashore, light  fires and arrange their beds for the night. They sleep on mats or with  the whole body, and head also, wrapped up closely in rugs. Either their  feet or heads are always within a few inches of the fire and their  bodies radiate out like the spokes of a wheel. Until 9.30 p.m., however,  when all lights on the steamer must be put out, a ceaseless chatter  proceeds with an occasional angry discussion as the natives take their  meal of kwanga, fish, and any odd piece of meat they can procure. It is  a somewhat weird sight, the black forms showing dimly in the ruddy light  of the fires under the trees. The bell on the steamer rings the command  and everyone goes to bed, and then one appreciates the real silence of  the equatorial forest which one has heard about at home. Within a few  yards, hundreds of frogs commence to croak loudly and continue steadily,  with a few pauses to breathe, until daybreak. Hundreds of monkeys "]]]
