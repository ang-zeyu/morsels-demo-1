Psalm 27:1. 1-6. First Part.  The church is our delight and safety.    1 The Lord of glory is my light,  And my salvation too;  God is my strength, nor will I fear  What all my foes can do.    2 One privilege my heart desires;  O grant me an abode  Among the churches of thy saints,  The temples of my God!    3 There shall I offer my requests,  And see thy beauty still,  Shall hear thy messages of love,  And there enquire thy will.    4 When troubles rise, and storms appear,  There may his children hide:  God has a strong pavilion where  He makes my soul abide.    5 Now shall my head be lifted high  Above my foes around,  And songs of joy and victory  Within thy temple sound.      Psalm 27:2. 8 9 13 14. Second Part.    Prayer and Hope.    1 Soon as I heard my Father say,  \"Ye children, seek my grace;\"  My heart reply'd without delay,  \"I'll seek my Father's face.\"    2 Let not thy face be hid from me,  Nor frown my soul away;  God of my life, I fly to thee  In a distressing day.    3 Should friends and kindred near and dear  Leave me to want, or die,  My God would make my life his care  And all my need supply.    4 My fainting flesh had dy'd with grief,  Had not my soul believ'd  To see thy grace provide relief,  Nor was my hope deceiv'd.    5 Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints,  And keep your courage up;  He'll raise your spirit when it faints,  And far exceed your hope.      Psalm 29. L. M.  Storm and thunder.    1 Give to the Lord, ye sons of fame,  Give to the Lord renown and power,  Ascribe due honours to his name,  And his eternal might adore.    2 The Lord proclaims his power aloud  Over the ocean and the land;  His voice divides the watery cloud,  And lightnings blaze at his command.    3 He speaks, and tempest, hail, and wind,  Lay the wide forests bare around;  The fearful hart, and frighted hind,  Leap at the terror of the sound.    4 To Lebanon he turns his voice,  And, lo, the stately cedars break;  The mountains tremble at the noise,  The vallies roar, the deserts quake.    5 The Lord sits sovereign on the flood,  The thunderer reigns for ever king;  But makes his church his blest abode,  Where we his awful glories sing.    6 In gentler language there the Lord  The counsels of his grace imparts;  Amidst the raging storm his word  Speaks peace and courage to our hearts.      Psalm 30:1. First Part.  Sickness healed, and sorrow removed.    1 I will extol thee, Lord, on high,  At thy command, diseases fly;  Who but a God can speak and save  From the dark borders of the grave?    2 Sing to the Lord, ye saints of his,  And tell how large his goodness is;  Let all your powers rejoice and bless,  While you record his holiness.    3 His anger but a moment stays  His love is life and length of days;  Tho' grief and tears the night employ,  The morning-star restores the joy.      Psalm 30:2. 6. Second Part.  Health, sickness, and recovery.    1 Firm was my health, my day was bright,  And I presum'd 'twould ne'er be night;  Fondly I said within my heart,  \"Pleasure and peace shall ne'er depart.\"    2 But I forgot thine arm was strong,  Which made my mountain stand so long;  Soon as thy face began to hide,  My health was gone, my comforts dy'd.    3 I cry'd aloud to thee, my God,  \"What canst thou profit by my blood?  \"Deep in the dust can I declare  \"Thy truth, or sing thy goodness there?    4 \"Hear me, O God of grace,\" I said,  \"And bring me from among the dead:\"  Thy word rebuk'd the pains I felt,  Thy pardoning love remov'd my guilt.    5 My groans, and tears, and forms of woe,  Are turn'd to joy and praises now;  I throw my sackcloth on the ground,  And ease and gladness gird me round.    6 My tongue, the glory of my frame,  Shall ne'er be silent of thy name  Thy praise shall sound thro' earth and heaven,  For sickness heal'd, and sins forgiven.      Psalm 31:1. 5 13-19 22 23. First Part.  Deliverance from death.    1 Into thine hand, 0 God of truth,  My spirit I commit;  Thou hast redeem'd my soul from death,  And sav'd me from the pit.    2 The passions of my hope and fear  Maintain'd a doubtful strife,  While sorrow, pain, and sin conspir'd  To take away my life.    3 \"My times are in thine hand,\" I cry'd,  \"Tho' I draw near the dust ;\"  Thou art the refuge where I hide,  The God in whom I trust.    4 O make thy reconciled face  Upon thy servant shine,  And save me for thy mercy's sake,  For I'm entirely thine.    PAUSE.    5 ['Twas in my haste, my spirit said,  \"I must despair and die,  \"I am cut off before thine eyes;\"  But thou hast heard me cry.]    6 Thy goodness how divinely free!  How wondrous is thy grace  To those that fear thy majesty,  And trust thy promises!    7 O love the Lord, all ye his saints,  And sing his praises loud;  He'll bend his ear to your complaints,  And recompense the proud.      Psalm 31:2. 7-13 18-21. Second Part.  Deliverance from slander and reproach.    1 My heart rejoices in thy name,  My God, my help, my trust;  Thou hast preserv'd my face from shame,  Mine honour from the dust.    2 \"My life is spent with grief,\" I cry'd,  \"My years consum'd in groans,  \"My strength decays, mine eyes are dry'd,  \"And sorrow wastes my bones.\"    3 Among mine enemies my name  Was a mere proverb grown,  While to my neighbours I became  Forgotten and unknown.    4 Slander and fear on every side,  Seiz'd and beset me round;  I to the throne of grace apply'd,  And speedy rescue found.    PAUSE.    5 How great deliverance thou hast wrought  Before the sons of men!  The lying lips to silence brought,  And made their boastings vain!    6 Thy children, from the strife of tongues,  Shall thy pavilion hide,  Guard them from infamy and wrongs,  And crush the sons of pride.    7 Within thy secret presence, Lord,  Let me for ever dwell;  No fenced city, wall'd and barr'd,  Secures a saint so well.      Psalm 32:1. S. M.  Forgiveness of sins upon confession.    1 O blessed souls are they  Whose sins are cover'd o'er!  Divinely blest, to whom the Lord  imputes their guilt no more.    2 They mourn their follies past,  And keep their hearts with care;  Their lips and lives without deceit,  Shall prove their faith sincere.    3 While I conceal'd my guilt  I felt the festering wound,  Till I confess'd my sins to thee,  And ready pardon found.    4 Let sinners learn to pray,  Let saints keep near the throne;  Our help in times of deep distress,  Is found in God alone.      Psalm 32:2. First Part. L. M.  Free pardon and sincere obedience;  or, Confession and forgiveness.    1 Happy the man to whom his God  No more imputes his sin,  But wash'd in the Redeemer's blood,  Hath made his garments clean!    2 Happy, beyond expression, he  Whose debts are thus discharg'd;  And from the guilty bondage free,  He feels his soul enlarg'd.    3 His spirit hates deceit and lies,  His words are all sincere;  He guards his heart, he guards his eyes,  To keep his conscience clear.    4 While I my inward guilt supprest,  No quiet could I find;  Thy wrath lay burning in my breast,  And rack'd my tortur'd mind.    5 Then I confess'd my troubled thoughts,  My secret sins reveal'd;  Thy pardoning grace forgave my faults,  Thy grace my pardon seal'd.    6 This shall invite thy saints to pray,  When, like a raging flood,  Temptations rise, our strength and stay  Is a forgiving God.      Psalm 32:3. L. M.  Repentance and free pardon;  or, Justification and sanctification.    1 Blest is the man, for ever blest,  Whose guilt is pardon'd by his God,  Whose sins with sorrow are confess'd,  And cover'd with his Saviour's blood.    2 Blest is the man to whom the Lord  Imputes not his iniquities,  He pleads no merit of reward,  And not on works, but grace relies.    3 From guile his heart and lips are free,  His humble joy, his holy fear,  With deep repentance well agree,  And join to prove his faith sincere.    4 How glorious is that righteousness  That hides and cancels all his sins!  While a bright evidence of grace  Thro' his whole life appears and shines.      Psalm 32:4. Second Part. L. M.  A guilty conscience eased by confession and pardon.    1 While I keep silence, and conceal  My heavy guilt within my heart,  What torments doth my conscience feel!  What agonies of inward smart!    2 I spread my sins before the Lord,  And all my secret faults confess;  Thy gospel speaks a pard'ning word  Thine Holy Spirit seals the grace.    3 For this shall every humble soul  Make swift addresses to thy seat;  When floods of huge temptations roll,  There shall they find a blest retreat.    4 How safe beneath thy wings I lie,  When days grow dark, and storms appear!  And when I walk, thy watchful eye  Shall guide me safe from every snare.      Psalm 33:1. First Part. C. M.  Works of creation and providence.    1 Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord,  This work belongs to you:  Sing of his name, his ways, his word,  How holy, just, and true!    2 His mercy and his righteousness  Let heaven and earth proclaim;  His works of nature and of grace  Reveal his wondrous name.    3 His wisdom and almighty word  The heavenly arches spread;  And by the Spirit of the Lord  Their shining hosts were made.    4 He bid the liquid waters flow  To their appointed deep;  The flowing seas their limits know,  And their own station keep.    5 Ye tenants of the spacious earth,  With fear before him stand;  He spake, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#9)"],[1,"and a general of honor, and  I never did any such trafficking,\" he cried grandly, when charged with  selling bogus patents of nobility.    He explained some of his correspondence with the Lapierres and his  famous bill for twelve thousand dollars by saying that when he found out  that the inheritance Tessier did not exist he had conceived the idea of  making a novel of the story--a \"fantastic history\"--to be published \"in  four languages simultaneously,\" and asserted solemnly that he had  intended printing the whole sixteen feet of bill as part of the romance.    Then, to the undisguised horror of the unfortunate General, at a summons  from the prosecutor an elderly French woman arose in the audience and  came to the bar. The General turned first pale, then purple. He hotly  denied that he had married this lady in France twenty-three years ago.    \"Name of a name! He had known her! Yes--certainly! But she was no wife  of his--she had been only his servant. The other lady--the  Hibernian--was his only wife.\" But the chickens had begun to come home  to roost. The pointed mustaches drooped with an unmistakable look of  dejection, and as he marched back to his seat his shoulders no longer  had the air of military distinction that one would expect in a general  of a \"Royal King.\" His head sank on his chest as his deserted wife took  the stand against him--the wife whom, he had imagined, he would never  see again.    Any one could have seen that Elizabeth de Moreno was a good woman. Her  father's name, she said, was Nichaud, and she had first met the prisoner  twenty-three years ago in the village of Dalk, in the Department of the  Tarne, where, in 1883, he had been convicted and sentenced for stealing  bed linen from the Hotel Kassam. She had remained faithful to him in  spite of his disgrace, and had visited him daily in prison, bringing him  milk and tobacco. On his liberation she had married him and they had  gone to live in Bordeaux. For years they had lived in comfort, and she  had borne him eight children. He had never been to any war and was  neither a general nor, so far as she had known, a friend of Don Carlos.  She had supposed that her husband held some position in connection with  the inspection of railroads, but, in 1902, it had come out that he was  in the business of selling counterfeit railroad tickets, and had  employed a printer named Paul Casignol to print great numbers of  third-class tickets for the purpose of selling them to ignorant soldiers  and artisans. Moreno had fled to America. She had then discovered that  he had also made a practice of checking worthless baggage, _stealing it  himself_ and then presenting claims therefor against the railroad  companies. She had been left without a sou, and the rascal had taken  everything she had away with him, including even the locket containing  the hair of her children. By the time she had finished her story  Moreno's courage had deserted him, the jury without hesitation returned  a verdict of guilty, and the judge then and there sentenced the prisoner  to a term at hard labor in State's prison.           *        *        *        *        *    \"_Mais oui_,\" grunts Lapierre, as the crow, with a final caw of  contempt, alights in a poplar farther down the road, \"I don't blame the  bird for laughing at me. But, after all, there is nothing to be ashamed  of. Is one to be blamed that one is fooled? _Hein_! We are all made  fools of once and again, and, as I said before, he would have deceived  the devil himself. But perhaps things are better as they are. Money is  the root of all evil. If I had an automobile I should probably be thrown  out and have my neck broken. But if M'sieu' intends to take the next  train for Bordeaux it is as well that he should be starting.\"          III    The Lost Stradivarius      In the year 1885 Jean Bott, a native of Hesse Cassel, Germany, emigrated  with his wife Matilda to this country, bringing with him a celebrated  violin known as \"The Duke of Cambridge Stradivarius,\" which he had  purchased in 1873 for about three thousand thalers--a sum representing  practically the savings of a lifetime. Bott had been leader of a small  orchestra in Saxe Meiningen as early as 1860, and was well advanced in  years before he determined to seek his fortune in America. His wife was  an elderly woman and they had no offspring.    \"This violin, my husband and myself made up the family--I loved it like  a child,\" she testified at the trial.    So also did Bott, the old musician, love his instrument, and no hand but  his own was ever permitted to lift it from its case or dust its  darkly-glowing surface.    Whatever may have been its owner's genius, he prospered little in the  new world, and, although he labored conscientiously at his profession,  the year 1894 found him still giving lessons upon the violin to only  half a dozen pupils, and living in two rooms at 355 West Thirty-first  Street. But Bott, having the soul of a true musician, cared but little  for money and was happy enough so long as he could smoke his old  meerschaum pipe and draw the bow across the cherished violin held  lovingly to his cheek. Then hard times came a-knocking at the door. The  meagre account in the savings-bank grew smaller and smaller. The  landlord, the doctor and the grocer had to be paid. One night Bott laid  down his pipe and, taking his wife's wrinkled hand in his, said gently:    \"Matilda, there is nothing else--we must sell our violin!\"    \"Even so!\" she answered, turning away her face that her husband might  not see the tears. \"As God wills.\"    The next day \"The Duke of Cambridge Stradivarius\" was offered for sale  by Victor S. Flechter, a friend of Bott's, who was a dealer in musical  instruments at 23 Union Square. It so happened that Nicolini, the  husband of Adelina Patti, was ambitious to own a genuine Stradivarius,  and had been looking for one for a long time, and, although he was but  an indifferent player, he had, in default of skill to perform, the money  to buy. The matter was easily adjusted by Flechter, and Nicolini drew  his check for the sum specified, which, properly certified, was tendered  to Bott. But Bott had never seen a certified check and was unaccustomed  to the ways of business.    \"If I part with my violin I must have real money--money that I can  feel--money that I can count. It was that kind of money that I paid for  my violin,\" said he doggedly.    Nicolini, in a rage, believing himself insulted, tore the check to bits  and declared the transaction at an end.    Now the price agreed upon for the violin had been forty-five hundred  dollars, of which Flechter was to receive five hundred dollars as his  commission, and when, through old Professor Bott's stubbornness, the  sale fell through, the dealer was naturally very angry. Out of this  incident grew the case against Flechter.    The old musician was accustomed to leave his treasured instrument in the  lowest drawer of his bureau at the boarding-house. He always removed it  before his pupils arrived and never put it back until their departure,  thus insuring the secrecy of its hiding-place, and only his wife, his  sister-in-law, Mollenhauer, a friend, and Klopton, a prospective  purchaser, knew where it lay.    On the morning of March 31, 1894, not long after the Nicolini incident,  Bott gave a single lesson to a pupil at the boarding-house, and after  his midday meal set out with his wife for Hoboken to visit a friend. The  violin was left in its customary place. It was dark when they returned,  and after throwing off his coat and lighting the gas the old man  hastened to make sure that his precious violin was safe. When he pulled  out the drawer it was empty. The Stradivarius was gone, with its leather  case, its two bows and its wooden box.    Half distracted the musician and his wife searched everywhere in the  room, in closets, under beds, even behind the curtains, before they  could bring themselves to admit that the violin had in fact disappeared.  Frantically Bott called for Ellen, the servant girl. Yes, there had been  a caller--a young man with dark hair and a small, dark mustache--at  about five o'clock. He had waited about half an hour and then had said  that he guessed he would go. She had not noticed that he took anything  away with him. In his despair the old man turned to his old friend  Flechter, and the next day the dealer came to express his sympathy. He  urged Bott to notify the police of the theft, but the old man was  prostrated with grief, and it was the wife who, with Ellen Clancy,  finally accompanied Flechter to Police Headquarters. The police had no  idea who had taken the old fellow's fiddle, and did not particularly  care anyway. Later they cared a good deal.    Bott now began an endless and almost hopeless search for his beloved  instrument, visiting every place where violins were sold, every pawnshop  and second-hand store again and again until the proprietors began to  think the old man must be crazy. Sometimes Flechter went with him. Once,  the two travelled all the way over to New Jersey, but the scent proved  to be a false one. Bott grew thinner and older week by week, almost day  by day. When the professor did not feel equal to going outdoors Mrs.  Bott went for him, and on these occasions often called at Flechter's  store to report progress, ask his advice and secure his encouragement.    One day during one of these visits in the July following the loss of the  violin Flechter handed Mrs. Bott a sheet of paper, saying:    \"I have written something down here. If you have that printed and put a  reward to it you will get your violin back.\"    The wording, partly printed and partly written in script, ran as  follows:        VIOLIN LOST. $500 REWARD.        No questions asked for return of instrument taken from residence of      Jean Bott March 31, 1894, 355 W. 31st St. Absolute safety and      secrecy guaranteed. Victor S."]]]
