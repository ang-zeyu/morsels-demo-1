[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12400"],[0,"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire (#9)"],[1,"to call together a meeting of well-known men in Berlin, who  should discuss the situation and be a moral counterpoise to the  meetings of the National Assembly; for in that the Conservative party  and even the Moderate Liberals were scarcely represented; if they did  speak they were threatened by the mob which encumbered the approaches to  the House. Of more permanent importance was the foundation of a  newspaper which should represent the principles of the Christian  monarchy, and in July appeared the first number of the _New Prussian  Gazette_, or, as it was to be more generally known, the _Kreuz Zeitung_,  which was to give its name to the party of which it was the organ.  Bismarck was among the founders, among whom were also numbered Stahl,  the Gerlachs, and others of his older friends; he was a frequent  contributor, and when he was at Berlin was almost daily at the office;  when he was in the country he contributed articles on the rural affairs  with which he was more specially qualified to deal.    These steps, of course, attracted the attention and the hostility of the  dominant Liberal and Revolutionary parties; the _Junker_, as they were  called, were accused of aiming at reaction and the restoration of the  absolute monarchy. As a matter of fact, this is what many of them  desired; they were, however, only doing their duty as members of  society; it would have been mere cowardice and indolence had they  remained inactive and seen all the institutions they valued overthrown  without attempting to defend them. It required considerable courage in  the middle of so violent a crisis to come forward and attempt to stop  the revolution; it was a good example that they began to do so by  constitutional and legal means. They shewed that Prussia had an  aristocracy, and an aristocracy which was not frightened; deserted by  the King they acted alone; in the hour of greatest danger they founded a  Conservative party, and matters had come to this position that an  organised Conservative party was the chief necessity of the time.    At first, however, their influence was small, for a monarchical party  must depend for its success on the adhesion of the King, and the King  had not yet resolved to separate himself from his Liberal advisers.  Bismarck was often at Court and seems to have had much influence; both  to his other companions and to the King himself he preached always  courage and resolution; he spoke often to the King with great openness;  he was supported by Leopold von Gerlach, with whom at this time he  contracted a close intimacy. For long their advice was in vain, but  in the autumn events occurred which shewed that some decision must be  taken: the mob of Berlin stormed the _Zeughaus_ where the arms  were kept; the Constitution of the Assembly was being drawn up so as to  leave the King scarcely any influence in the State; a resolution was  passed calling on the Ministers to request all officers to leave the  army who disliked the new order of things. The crisis was brought about  by events in Vienna; in October the Austrian army under Jellachich  and Windischgraetz stormed the city, proclaimed martial law, and forcibly  overthrew the Revolutionary Government; the King of Prussia now summoned  resolution to adopt a similar course. It is said that Bismarck suggested  to him the names of the Ministers to whom the task should be entrusted.  The most important were Count Brandenburg, an uncle of the King's, and  Otto v. Manteuffel, a member of the Prussian aristocracy, who with  Bismarck had distinguished himself in the Estates General. He seems to  have been constantly going about among the more influential men,  encouraging them as he encouraged the King, and helping behind the scenes  to prepare for the momentous step. Gerlach had suggested Bismarck's name  as one of the Ministers, but the King rejected it, writing on the side of  the paper the characteristic words, \"Red reactionary; smells of blood;  will be useful later.\" Bismarck's language was of such a nature as to  alarm even many of those who associated with him. Count Beust, the Saxon  Minister, was at this time in Berlin and met Bismarck for the first time;  they were discussing the conduct of the Austrian Government in shooting  Robert Blum, a leading demagogue who had been in Vienna during the siege.  Beust condemned it as a political blunder. \"No, you are wrong,\" said  Bismarck; \"when I have my enemy in my power I must destroy him.\"    The event fully justified Bismarck's forecast that nothing was required  but courage and resolution. After Brandenburg had been appointed  Minister, the Prussian troops under Wrangel again entered Berlin, a  state of siege was proclaimed, the Assembly was ordered to adjourn to  Brandenburg; they refused and were at once ejected from their  meeting-place, and as a quorum was not found at Brandenburg, were  dissolved. The Crown then of its own authority published a new  Constitution and summoned a new Assembly to discuss and ratify it. Based  on the discipline of the army the King had regained his authority  without the loss of a single life.    Bismarck stood for election in this new Assembly, for he could accept  the basis on which it had been summoned; he took his seat for the  district of the West Havel in which the old city of Brandenburg, the  original capital of the Mark, was situated. He had come forward as an  opponent of the Revolution. \"Everyone,\" he said in his election address,  \"must support the Government in the course they have taken of combating  the Revolution which threatens us all.\" \"No transaction with the  Revolution,\" was the watchword proposed in the manifesto of his party.  He appealed to the electors as one who would direct all his efforts to  restore the old bond of confidence between Crown and people. He kept his  promise. In this Assembly the Extreme Left was still the predominant  party; in an address to the Crown they asked that the state of siege at  Berlin should be raised, and that an amnesty to those who had fought on  the 18th of March should be proclaimed. Bismarck did not yet think that  the time for forgiveness had come; the struggle was indeed not yet over.  He opposed the first demand because, as he said, there was more danger  to liberty of debate from the armed mob than there was from the Prussian  soldiers. In one of the most careful of his speeches he opposed the  amnesty. \"Amnesty,\" he said, \"was a right of the Crown, not of the  Assembly\"; moreover the repeated amnesties were undermining in the  people the feeling of law; the opinion was being spread about that the  law of the State rested on the barricades, that everyone who disliked a  law or considered it unjust had the right to consider it as  non-existent. Who that has read the history of Europe during this year  can doubt the justice of the remark? Then he continues:      \"My third reason for voting against the amnesty is humanity. The    strife of principles which during this year has shattered Europe    to its foundations is one in which no compromise is possible.    They rest on opposite bases. The one draws its law from what is    called the will of the people, in truth, however, from the law of    the strongest on the barricades. The other rests on authority    created by God, an authority by the grace of God, and seeks its    development in organic connection with the existing and    constitutional legal status ... the decision on these principles    will come not by Parliamentary debate, not by majorities of    eleven votes; sooner or later the God who directs the battle will    cast his iron dice.\"    These words were greeted with applause, not only by the men who sat on  his side of the House, but by those opposite to him. The truth of them  was to be shewn by the events which were taking place at that very time.  They were spoken on the 22d of March. The next day was fought the battle  of Novara and it seemed that the last hopes of the Italian patriots were  shattered. Within a few months the Austrian army subdued with terrible  vengeance the rising in Lombardy and Venetia; Hungary was prostrate  before the troops whom the Czar sent to help the young Austrian  Emperor, and the last despairing outbreak of rebellion in Saxony and in  Baden was to be subdued by the Prussian army. The Revolution had failed  and it had raised up, as will always happen, a military power, harder,  crueller, and more resolute than that it had overthrown. The control  over Europe had passed out of the hands of Metternich and Louis Philippe  to fall into those of Nicholas, Schwarzenberg, and Napoleon III.    In Prussia the King used his power with moderation, the conflict of  parties was continued within legal limits and under constitutional  forms.    The Parliament which still claimed that control over the executive  government which all Parliaments of the Revolution had exercised, was  dissolved. A new Assembly met in August; the King had of his own  authority altered the electoral law and the new Parliament showed a  considerable majority belonging to the more moderate Liberal party.  Bismarck retained his old seat. He still found much to do; his influence  was increasing; he opposed the doctrines of the more moderate Liberalism  with the same energy with which he had attacked the extreme Revolution.  The most important debates were those concerning the Constitution; he  took part in them, especially opposing the claim of the Parliament to  refuse taxes. He saw that if the right was given to the Lower House of  voting the taxes afresh every year they would be able to establish a  complete control over the executive government; this he did not wish. He  was willing that they should have the right of discussing and rejecting  any new taxes and also, in agreement with the Crown and the Upper House,  of determining the annual Budget. It was maintained by the Liberals that  the right to reject supplies every year was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#9)"],[1,"the world, especially on the harmony of rays emanating  on the earth from the heavenly bodies, and on their effect in nature and  on the sublunary and human soul; the fifth, astronomical and  metaphysical, on the very exquisite Harmonics of the celestial motions  and the origin of the excentricities in harmonious proportions.\" The  extravagance of his fancies does not appear until the fourth book, in  which he reiterates the statement that he was forced to adopt his  astrological opinions from direct and positive observation. He despises  \"The common herd of prophesiers who describe the operations of the stars  as if they were a sort of deities, the lords of heaven and earth, and  producing everything at their pleasure. They never trouble themselves to  consider what means the stars have of working any effects among us on  the earth whilst they remain in the sky and send down nothing to us  which is obvious to the senses, except rays of light.\" His own notion is  \"Like one who listens to a sweet melodious song, and by the gladness of  his countenance, by his voice, and by the beating of his hand or foot  attuned to the music, gives token that he perceives and approves the  harmony: just so does sublunary nature, with the notable and evident  emotion of the bowels of the earth, bear like witness to the same  feelings, especially at those times when the rays of the planets form  harmonious configurations on the earth,\" and again \"The earth is not an  animal like a dog, ready at every nod; but more like a bull or an  elephant, slow to become angry, and so much the more furious when  incensed.\" He seems to have believed the earth to be actually a living  animal, as witness the following: \"If anyone who has climbed the peaks  of the highest mountains, throw a stone down their very deep clefts, a  sound is heard from them; or if he throw it into one of the mountain  lakes, which beyond doubt are bottomless, a storm will immediately  arise, just as when you thrust a straw into the ear or nose of a  ticklish animal, it shakes its head, or runs shudderingly away. What so  like breathing, especially of those fish who draw water into their  mouths and spout it out again through their gills, as that wonderful  tide! For although it is so regulated according to the course of the  moon, that, in the preface to my 'Commentaries on Mars,' I have  mentioned it as probable that the waters are attracted by the moon, as  iron by the loadstone, yet if anyone uphold that the earth regulates its  breathing according to the motion of the sun and moon, as animals have  daily and nightly alternations of sleep and waking, I shall not think  his philosophy unworthy of being listened to; especially if any flexible  parts should be discovered in the depths of the earth, to supply the  functions of lungs or gills.\"    In the same book Kepler enlarges again on his views in reference to the  basis of astrology as concerned with nativities and the importance of  planetary conjunctions. He gives particulars of his own nativity.  \"Jupiter nearest the nonagesimal had passed by four degrees the trine of  Saturn; the Sun and Venus in conjunction were moving from the latter  towards the former, nearly in sextiles with both: they were also  removing from quadratures with Mars, to which Mercury was closely  approaching: the moon drew near to the trine of the same planet, close  to the Bull's Eye even in latitude. The 25th degree of Gemini was  rising, and the 22nd of Aquarius culminating. That there was this triple  configuration on that day--namely the sextile of Saturn and the Sun,  the sextile of Mars and Jupiter, and the quadrature of Mercury and Mars,  is proved by the change of weather; for after a frost of some days, that  very day became warmer, there was a thaw and a fall of rain.\" This  alleged \"proof\" is interesting as it relies on the same principle which  was held to justify the correction of an uncertain birth-time, by  reference to illnesses, etc., met with later. Kepler however goes on to  say, \"If I am to speak of the results of my studies, what, I pray, can I  find in the sky, even remotely alluding to it? The learned confess that  several not despicable branches of philosophy have been newly extricated  or amended or brought to perfection by me: but here my constellations  were, not Mercury from the East in the angle of the seventh, and in  quadratures with Mars, but Copernicus, but Tycho Brahe, without whose  books of observations everything now set by me in the clearest light  must have remained buried in darkness; not Saturn predominating Mercury,  but my lords the Emperors Rudolph and Matthias, not Capricorn the house  of Saturn but Upper Austria, the house of the Emperor, and the ready and  unexampled bounty of his nobles to my petition. Here is that corner, not  the western one of the horoscope, but on the earth whither, by  permission of my Imperial master, I have betaken myself from a too  uneasy Court; and whence, during these years of my life, which now tends  towards its setting, emanate these Harmonics and the other matters on  which I am engaged.\"    The fifth book contains a great deal of nonsense about the harmony of  the spheres; the notes contributed by the several planets are gravely  set down, that of Mercury having the greatest resemblance to a melody,  though perhaps more reminiscent of a bugle-call. Yet the book is not all  worthless for it includes Kepler's Third Law, which he had diligently  sought for years. In his own words, \"The proportion existing between the  periodic times of any two planets is exactly the sesquiplicate  proportion of the mean distances of the orbits,\" or as generally given,  \"the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the  mean distances.\" Kepler was evidently transported with delight and  wrote, \"What I prophesied two and twenty years ago, as soon as I  discovered the five solids among the heavenly orbits,--what I firmly  believed long before I had seen Ptolemy's 'Harmonics'--what I had  promised my friends in the title of this book, which I named before I  was sure of my discovery,--what sixteen years ago I urged as a thing to  be sought,--that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in  Prague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life to  astronomical computations, at length I have brought to light, and have  recognised its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations. Great as is  the absolute nature of Harmonics, with all its details as set forth in  my third book, it is all found among the celestial motions, not indeed  in the manner which I imagined (that is not the least part of my  delight), but in another very different, and yet most perfect and  excellent. It is now eighteen months since I got the first glimpse of  light, three months since the dawn, very few days since the unveiled  sun, most admirable to gaze on, burst out upon me. Nothing holds me; I  will indulge in my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by the  honest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians  to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt.  If you forgive me, I rejoice, if you are angry, I can bear it; the die  is cast, the book is written; to be read either now or by posterity, I  care not which; it may well wait a century for a reader, as God has  waited six thousand years for an observer.\" He gives the date 15th May,  1618, for the completion of his discovery. In his \"Epitome of the  Copernican Astronomy,\" he gives his own idea as to the reason for this  Third Law. \"Four causes concur for lengthening the periodic time. First,  the length of the path; secondly, the weight or quantity of matter to be  carried; thirdly, the degree of strength of the moving virtue; fourthly,  the bulk or space into which is spread out the matter to be moved. The  orbital paths of the planets are in the simple ratio of the distances;  the weights or quantities of matter in different planets are in the  subduplicate ratio of the same distances, as has been already proved; so  that with every increase of distance a planet has more matter and  therefore is moved more slowly, and accumulates more time in its  revolution, requiring already, as it did, more time by reason of the  length of the way. The third and fourth causes compensate each other in  a comparison of different planets; the simple and subduplicate  proportion compound the sesquiplicate proportion, which therefore is the  ratio of the periodic times.\" The only part of this \"explanation\" that  is true is that the paths are in the simple ratio of the distances, the  \"proof\" so confidently claimed being of the circular kind commonly known  as \"begging the question\". It was reserved for Newton to establish the  Laws of Motion, to find the law of force that would constrain a planet  to obey Kepler's first and second Laws, and to prove that it must  therefore also obey the third.              CHAPTER VI.    CLOSING YEARS.      Soon after its publication Kepler's \"Epitome\" was placed along with the  book of Copernicus, on the list of books prohibited by the Congregation  of the Index at Rome, and he feared that this might prevent the  publication or sale of his books in Austria also, but was told that  though Galileo's violence was getting him into trouble, there would be  no difficulty in obtaining permission for learned men to read any  prohibited books, and that he (Kepler) need fear nothing so long as he  remained quiet.    In his various works on Comets, he adhered to the opinion that they  travelled in straight lines with varying velocity. He suggested that  comets come from the remotest parts of ether, as whales and monsters  from the depth of the sea, and that perhaps they are something of the  nature of silkworms, and are wasted and consumed in spinning their own  tails. Napier's invention of logarithms at once attracted Kepler's  attention. He must have"]]]
