Thyself increate, thou art the lord of  the mobile and the immobile universe, the Creator of all, O thou  foremost of all existences! And, O slayer of Madhu, O thou of abundant  energy, in the forest of Chitraratha thou didst, O Krishna, gratify with  thy sacrifice the chief of all the gods, the highest of the high! O  Janardana, at each sacrifice thou didst offer, according to shares, gold  by hundreds and thousands. And, O son of the Yadava race, becoming the  son of Aditi, O exalted one of the supreme attributes, thou hast been  known as the younger brother of Indra! And, O thou chastiser of foes,  even while a child thou didst, O Krishna, in consequence of thy energy,  fill by three steps only the heaven, the firmament, and the earth! And,  O thou soul of all covering the heaven and the firmament (while thou  wert thus transformed), thou didst dwell in the body of the sun and  afflict him with thy own splendour! And, O exalted one, in thy  incarnations on those thousand occasions, thou hadst slain, O Krishna,  sinful Asuras by hundreds! By destroying the _Mauravas_ and the  _Pashas_, and slaying Nisunda and Naraka, thou hast again rendered safe  the road to Pragjyotisha! Thou hast slain Ahvriti at Jaruthi, and Kratha  and Sisupala with his adherents, and Jarasandha and Saivya and  Satadhanwan! And on thy car roaring like unto clouds and effulgent like  the sun, thou didst obtain for thy queen the daughter of Bhoja,  defeating Rukmi in battle! Thou didst in fury slay Indradyumna and the  _Yavana_ called Kaseruman! And slaying Salwa the lord of Saubha, thou  didst destroy that city of Saubha itself! These have all been slain in  battle; listen to me as I speak of others (also slain by thee)! At  Iravati thou hast slain king Bhoja equal unto Karttavirya in battle, and  both Gopati and Talaketu also have been slain by thee! And, O Janardana,  thou hast also appropriated unto thyself the sacred city of Dwarka,  abounding in wealth and agreeable unto the _Rishi_ themselves, and thou  wilt submerge it at the end within the ocean! O slayer of Madhu, how can  crookedness be in thee, devoid as thou art, O thou of the Dasarha race,  of anger and envy and untruth and cruelty? O thou who knowest no  deterioration, all the _Rishis_, coming unto thee seated in thy glory on  the sacrificial ground, seek protection of thee! And, O slayer of Madhu,  thou stayest at the end of the _Yuga_, contracting all things and  withdrawing this universe into thy own self, thou repressor of all foes!  O thou of the Vrishni race, at the beginning of the Yuga, there sprang  from thy lotus-like navel, Brahma himself, and lord of all mobile and  immobile things, and whose is this entire universe! When the dreadful  Danavas Madhu and Kaitava were bent on slaying Brahma, beholding their  impious endeavour thou wert angry, and from thy forehead, O Hari, sprang  Sambhu, the holder of the trident. Thus these two foremost of the  deities have sprung from thy body in order to do thy work! Even Narada  it was who hath told me this! O Narayana, thou didst, in the forest of  Chaitraratha, celebrate with plentiful gifts a grand sacrifice  consisting of a multitude of rites! O God, O thou of eyes like lotus  leaves, the deeds thou hast performed while still a boy, having recourse  to thy might and aided by Baladeva, have never been done by others, nor  are they capable of being achieved by others in the future! Thou didst  even dwell in Kailasa, accompanied by Brahmanas!'\"        [16] Also called _Vadarika_, a hermitage on the Himalaya near      the sources of the Ganges.        [17] Nilakantha explains _kshetra_ as including _Mahabhuta_,      consciousness, intellect, the unmanifest (primordial elements),      the ten senses, the five objects of the senses, viz., earth,      water, &c., desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, the combinations      of elements, and _chaitanya_.        [18] _Hari_ here means the developed seed that is to expand into      the vast whole of the universe.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having addressed Krishna thus, the illustrious  Pandava, who was the soul of Krishna, became dumb, when Janardana (in  reply addressed that son of Pritha) saying, 'Thou art mine and I am  thine, while all that is mine is thine also! He that hateth thee hateth  me as well, and he that followeth thee followeth me! O thou  irrepressible one, thou art _Nara_ and I am _Narayana_ or Hari! We are  the _Rishis_ Nara and Narayana born in the world of men for a special  purpose. O Partha, thou art from me and I am from thee! O bull of the  Bharata race, no one can understand the difference that is between us!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"When the illustrious Kesava had said so in the  midst of that assembly of brave kings, all excited with anger, Panchali  surrounded by Dhrishtadyumna and her other heroic brothers, approached  him of eyes like lotus leaves seated with his cousins, and, desirous of  protection, addressed in angry accents that refuge of all, saying,  'Asita and Devala have said that in the matter of the creation of all  things, thou hast been indicated (by the sages) as the only _Prajapati_  and the Creator of all the worlds! And, O irrepressible one, Jamadagnya  sayeth that thou art _Vishnu_, and, O slayer of Madhu, that thou art  (embodiment of) _Sacrifice, Sacrificer_ and he for whom the sacrifice is  performed! And, O best of male beings, the _Rishis_ indicate thee as  Forgiveness and Truth! Kasyapa hath said that thou art Sacrifice sprung  from Truth! O exalted one, Narada calleth thee the god of the Sadhyas,  and of the Sivas, as alone the Creator and the Lord of all things. And,  O tiger among men, thou repeatedly sportest with the gods including  Brahma and Sankara and Sakra even as children sporting with their toys!  And, O exalted one, the firmament is covered by thy head, and the earth  by thy feet; these worlds are as thy womb and thou art the Eternal one!  With _Rishis_ sanctified by Vedic lore and asceticism, and whose souls  have been purified by penance, and who are contented with soul-vision,  thou art the best of all objects! And, O chief of all male beings, thou  art the refuge of all royal sages devoted to virtuous acts, never  turning their backs on the field of the battle, and possessed of every  accomplishment! Thou art the Lord of all, thou art Omnipresent, thou art  the Soul of all things, and thou art the active power pervading  everything! The rulers of the several worlds, those worlds themselves,  the stellar conjunctions, the ten points of the horizon, the firmament,  the moon, and the sun, are all established in thee! And, O mighty-armed  one, the morality of (earthly) creatures, the immortality of the  universe, are established in thee! Thou art the Supreme lord of all  creatures, celestial or human! Therefore it is, O slayer of Madhu, that  impelled by the affection thou bearest me that I will relate to thee my  griefs! O Krishna, how could one like me, the wife of Pritha's sons, the  sister of Dhrishtadyumna, and the friend of thee, be dragged to the  assembly! Alas, during my season, stained with blood, with but a single  cloth on, trembling all over, and weeping, I was dragged to the court of  the Kurus! Beholding me, stained with blood in the presence of those  kings in the assembly, the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra laughed at me! O  slayer of Madhu, while the sons of Pandu and the Panchalas and the  Vrishnis lived, they dared express the desire of using me as their  slave! O Krishna, I am according to the ordinance, the daughter in-law  of both Dhritarashtra and Bhishma! Yet, O slayer of Madhu, they wished  to make of me a slave by force! I blame the Pandavas who are mighty and  foremost in battle, for they saw (without stirring) their own wedded  wife known over all the world, treated with such cruelty! Oh, fie on the  might of Bhimasena, fie on the _Gandiva_ of Arjuna, for they, O  Janardana, both suffered me to be thus disgraced by little men! This  eternal course of morality is ever followed by the virtuous--_viz_, that  the husband, however weak, protecteth his wedded wife! By protecting the  wife one protecteth his offspring and by protecting the offspring one  protecteth his own self! One's own self is begotten on one's wife, and  therefore it is that the wife is called _Jaya_. A wife also should  protect her lord, remembering that he is to take his birth in her womb!  The Pandavas never forsake the person that soliciteth their protection,  and yet they abandoned me who solicited it! By my five husbands five  sons of exceeding energy have been born of me: Prativindhya by  Yudhishthira, Sutasoma by Vrikodara, Srutakirti by Arjuna, Satanika by  Nakula and Srutakarman by the youngest, all of them of energy that  cannot be baffled. For their sake, O Janardana, it was necessary to  protect me! Even as (thy son) Pradyumna, they are, O Krishna, mighty  warriors all! They are foremost of bowmen, and invincible in battle by  any foe! Why do they bear the wrongs inflicted (on me) by the sons of  Dhritarashtra of such contemptible strength? Deprived of their kingdom  by deception, the Pandavas were made bondsmen and I myself was dragged  to the assembly while in my season, and having only a single cloth on!  Fie on that _Gandiva_ which none else can string save Arjuna and Bhima  and thyself, O slayer of Madhu! Fie on the strength of Bhima, and fie on  the prowess of Arjuna, since, O Krishna, Duryodhana (after what he had  done) hath drawn breath even for a moment! He it is, O slayer of Madhu,  who formerly drove the guileless Pandavas with their mother from the  kingdom, while they were children still engaged in study and the  observance of their vows. It is that sinful wretch, who, horrible to  relate, mixed in Bhima's food fresh and virulent poison in full dose.  But, O Janardana, Bhima digested that poison with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#9)"],[1,"    At last, Krishna relents. He stands among them and seeing him, their cares  vanish 'as creepers revive when sprinkled with the water of life.' Some  of the cowgirls hardly dare to be angry but others upbraid him for so  brusquely deserting them. To all, Krishna gives the same answer. He is not  to be judged by ordinary standards. He is a constant fulfiller of desire.  It was to test the strength of their love that he left them in the forest.  They have survived this stringent test and convinced him of their love.  The girls are in no mood to query his explanation and 'uniting with him'  they overwhelm him with frantic caresses.    Krishna now uses his 'delusive power' in order to provide each girl with  a semblance of himself. He asks them to dance and then projects a whole  series of Krishnas. 'The cowgirls in pairs joined hands and Krishna was  in their midst. Each thought he was at her side and did not recognize him  near anyone else. They put their fingers in his fingers and whirled about  with rapturous delight. Krishna in their midst was like a lovely cloud  surrounded by lightning. Singing, dancing, embracing and loving, they  passed the hours in extremities of bliss. They took off their clothes,  their ornaments and jewels and offered them to Krishna. The gods in heaven  gazed on the scene and all the goddesses longed to join. The singing  mounted in the night air. The winds were stilled and the streams ceased to  flow. The stars were entranced and the water of life poured down from the  great moon. So the night went on--on and on--and only when six months were  over did the dancers end their joy.'    As, at last, the dance concludes, Krishna takes the cowgirls to the Jumna,  bathes with them in the water, rids himself of fatigue and then after once  again gratifying their passions, bids them go home. When they reach their  houses, no one is aware that they have not been there all the time.    [Footnote 25: Plate 11.]    [Footnote 26: Plate 12.]    [Footnote 27: Note 11.]    [Footnote 28: Plate 13.]    [Footnote 29: Plate 14.]    [Footnote 30: Plate 15.]        (iii) The Death of the Tyrant      This scene with its crescendos of excitement, its delight in physical  passion and ecstatic exploration of sexual desire is, in many ways, the  climax of Krishna's pastoral career. It expresses the devotion felt for  him by the cowgirls. It stresses his loving delight in their company. It  suggests the blissful character of the ultimate union. No further  revelation, in fact, is necessary for this is the crux of Krishna's life.  None the less the ostensible reason for his birth remains--to rid the  earth of the vicious tyrant Kansa--and to this the _Purana_ now returns.    We have seen how in his anxious quest for the child who is to kill him,  Kansa has dispatched his demon warriors on roving commissions, authorizing  them to attack and kill all likely children. Many children have in this  way been slaughtered but Kansa is still uncertain whether his prime  purpose has been fulfilled. He has no certain knowledge that among the  dead children is his dreaded enemy. He is still unaware that Krishna is  destined to be his foe and he therefore continues the hunt, his demon  emissaries pouncing like commandos on youthful stragglers and hounding  them to their deaths. Among such youths Krishna is still an obvious target  and although unaware that this is the true object of their quest, demons  continue to harry him.    One night Krishna and Balarama are in the forest with the cowgirls when a  yaksha demon, Sankhasura, a jewel flashing in his head, comes among them.  He drives the cowgirls off but hearing their cries, Krishna follows after.  Balarama stays with the girls while Krishna catches and beheads the demon.    On another occasion, Krishna and Balarama are returning at evening with  the cows when a bull demon careers amongst them. He runs amok scattering  the cattle in all directions. Krishna, however, is not at all daunted and  after wrestling with the bull, catches its horns and breaks its neck.    To such blind attacks there is no immediate end. One day, however, a sage  discloses to Kansa the true identity of his enemy. He tells him in what  manner Balarama and Krishna were born, how Balarama was transferred  from Devaki's womb to that of Rohini, and how Krishna was transported  to Nanda's house in Gokula. Kansa is now confronted with the ghastly  truth--how Vasudeva's willingness to surrender his first six sons has  lulled his suspicions, how his confidence in Vasudeva has been entirely  misplaced, and how completely he has been deceived. He sends for Vasudeva  and is on the point of killing him when the sage interposes, advising  Kansa to imprison Vasudeva for the present and meanwhile make an all-out  attempt to kill or capture Balarama and Krishna. Kansa sees the force of  his remarks, spares Vasudeva for the moment, throws him and Devaki into  jail and dispatches a special demon, the horse Kesi, on a murderous  errand.    As the horse speeds on its way, Kansa assembles his demon councillors,  explains the situation to them and asks for their advice. If Krishna  should not be killed in the forest, the only alternative, the demons  suggest, is to decoy him to Mathura. Let a handsome theatre be built, a  sacrifice to Siva held and a special festival of arms proclaimed. All the  cowherds will naturally come to see it. Nanda, the rich herdsman, will  bring presents, Krishna and Balarama will come with other cowherds. When  they have arrived the wrestler Chanura can throw them down and kill them.  Kansa is delighted at the suggestion, adding only that a savage elephant  should be stationed at the gate ready to tear Krishna and Balarama to  pieces immediately they enter. He then dismisses his demon advisers and  sends for Akrura, the chief of the Yadavas and a leading member of his  court. Akrura, he judges, will be the best person to decoy Krishna to  Mathura. He accordingly briefs him as to his intentions and instructs him  to await orders. Akrura deems it politic to express compliance but  secretly is overjoyed that he will thus obtain access to the Krishna he  adores.    The first stage of Kansa's master plan is now brought into effect. The  horse demon, Kesi, reaches Brindaban and begins to paw the ground and kick  up its heels. The cowherds are frightened but Krishna dares it to attack.  The horse tries to bite him but Krishna plunges his hand down its throat  and expands it to a vast size until the demon bursts. Its remains litter  the ground but Krishna is so unmoved that he merely summons the cowherd  children to play a game. Squatting with them under a fig tree, he names  one of them a general, another a minister, a third a councillor and  himself pretending to be a raja plays with them at being king. A little  later they join him in a game of blind man's bluff.    This unexpected _denouement_ enrages Kansa but instead of desisting from  the attempt and bringing into force the second part of his plan, he  decides to make one further effort to murder his hated foe. He accordingly  summons the wolf demon, Vyamasura, gives him detailed instructions and  dispatches him to Brindaban. The demon hies to the forest, arriving while  Krishna and the children are still at blind man's buff. He has dressed  himself as a beggar and going humbly up to Krishna asks if he may join in.  Krishna tells him to choose whatever game he likes and the demon says,  'What about the game of wolf and rams?' 'Very well,' Krishna answers, 'You  be the wolf and the cowherd boys the rams.' They start to play and the  demon rounds up all the children and keeps them in a cave. Then, assuming  true wolf's form he pounces on Krishna. Krishna, however, is quite  prepared and seizing the wolf by the throat, strangles it to death.    Akrura is now sent for and instructed to go to Brindaban and return with  Krishna to Mathura. He sets out and as he journeys allows his thoughts to  dwell on the approaching meeting. 'Now,' he muses 'has my life borne  fruit; my night is followed by the dawn of day; since I shall see the  countenance of Vishnu, whose eyes are like the expanded leaf of the lotus.  I shall behold that lotus-eyed aspect of Vishnu, which, when seen only in  imagination, takes away the sins of men. I shall today behold that glory  of glories, the mouth of Vishnu, whence proceeded the Vedas, and all their  dependent sciences. I shall see the sovereign of the world, by whom the  world is sustained; who is worshipped as the best of males, as the male  sacrifice in sacrificial rites. I shall see Vishnu, who is without  beginning or end; by worshipping whom with a hundred sacrifices, Indra  obtained the sovereignty over the gods. The soul of all, the knower of  all, he who is all and is present in all, he who is permanent, undecaying,  all-pervading will converse with me. He, the unborn, who has preserved the  world in the various forms of a fish, tortoise, a boar, a horse, a lion  will this day speak to me. Now the lord of the earth, who assumes shapes  at will, has taken upon him the condition of humanity, to accomplish some  object cherished in his heart. Glory to that being whose deceptive  adoption of father, son, brother, friend, mother, and relative, the world  is unable to penetrate. May he in whom cause and effect, and the world  itself, is comprehended, be propitious to me, through his truth; for  always do I put my trust in that unborn, eternal Vishnu; by meditation on  whom man becomes the repository of all good things.'[31]    He goes on to think of how he will kneel before Krishna with folded hands  and afterwards put on his head the dust of Krishna's feet--the same feet  which 'have come to destroy crime, which fell on the snake Kaliya's head  and which have danced with the cowgirls in the forest.' Krishna, he  believes, will know at once that he is not Kansa's envoy and will receive  him with kindness. And this is "]]]
