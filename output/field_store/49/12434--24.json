Mr. Park waited accordingly, and in about  three hours the boy returned with the negro. In the afternoon, they  reached a town called Samamingkoos, inhabited chiefly by Foulahs.    On the 4th they arrived at a large town called Sampaka, where, on  hearing that a white man was come into the town, the people, who had  been keeping holiday and dancing, left of this pastime, and walking  in regular order two by two, with the music before them, came to Mr.  Park. They played upon a flute, which they blowed obliquely over the  end, and governed the holes on the sides with their fingers. Their  airs were plaintive and simple.    Mr. Park stopped at Sampaka for the sake of being accompanied by some  of the inhabitants, who were going to Goomba; but in order to avoid  the crowd of people, whom curiosity had assembled round him, he  visited in the evening a negro village called Samee, where he was  kindly received by the dooty, who killed two fine sheep, and invited  his friends to the feast. On the following day his landlord insisted  on his staying till the cool of the evening, when he would conduct  him to the next village. Mr. Park was now within two days journey of  Goomba, and had no further apprehension of being molested by the  moors. He therefore accepted the invitation, and passed the forenoon  very agreeably with the poor negroes, the mildness of their manners  forming a striking contrast to the savageness and ferocity of the  moors. In the midst of their cheerfulness, a party of moors  unexpectedly entered the hut. They came, they said, by Ali's orders,  to convey the white man to his camp at Benown. They told Mr. Park,  that if he did not make any resistance, he was not in any danger, but  if he showed any reluctance, they had orders to bring him by force.  Mr. Park was confounded and terrified; the moors, observing his  consternation, repeated the assurance of his safety, and added, that  they had come to gratify the curiosity of Ali's wife, who was  extremely desirous to see a Christian, but that afterwards, they had  no doubt that Ali would make him a present, which would compensate  for his trouble, and conduct him safely to Bambarra. Entreaty or  refusal would have been equally unavailing. Mr. Park took leave of  his landlord and company with great reluctance, and, attended by his  negro boy (for Daman's slave made his escape on seeing the Moors),  followed the messengers, and reached Dalli in the evening, where they  were strictly watched for the night.    On the following day, Mr. Park and his boy were conducted by a  circuitous path, through the woods to Dangoli, where they slept. They  continued their journey on the 9th, and without any particular  occurrence arrived at Deena, when Mr. Park went to pay his respects  to one of Ali's sons. He sat in a hut, with five or six companions,  washing their hands, feet, and mouths. The prince handed Mr. Park a  double-barrelled gun, and told him to dye the stock blue, and repair  one of the locks. Mr. Park with great difficulty persuaded him that  he knew nothing of gun-making, then, said he, you shall give me some  knives and scissors immediately. The boy, who acted as interpreter,  declaring Mr. Park had no such articles, he hastily snatched up a  musket, and would have shot the boy dead upon the spot, had not the  Moors interfered, and made signs to the strangers to retreat. The boy  attempted to make his escape in the night, but was prevented by the  Moors, who guarded both him, and his master, with the strictest  attention.    On the 12th, Mr. Park and his guards departed for Benown, and reached  the camp of Ali a little before sunset. It was composed of a great  number of dirty tents, scattered without order, amongst which  appeared large herds of camels, cattle, and goats. Mr. Park had no  sooner arrived, than he was surrounded by such a crowd, that he could  scarcely move. One pulled his clothes, another took off his hat, a  third examined his waistcoat buttons, and a fourth calling out, _La  ilia el Allah, Mahomet ra sowl Allald_ (there is but one God, and  Mahomet is his prophet), signifying, in a menacing tone, that he must  repeat those words. At length, he was conducted to the king's tent,  where a number of both sexes were waiting his arrival. Ali appeared  to be an old man of the Arab cast, with a long white beard, and of a  sullen and proud countenance. Having gazed on the stranger, he  inquired of the Moors, if he could speak Arabic, hearing that he  could not, he appeared much surprised, but made no remarks. The  ladies were more inquisitive; they asked many questions, inspected  every part of Mr. Park's dress, unbuttoned his waistcoat to display  the whiteness of his skin; they even counted his toes and fingers. In  a short time, the priest announced evening prayers, but before the  people departed, some boys had tied a wild hog to one of the tent  strings. Ali made signs to Mr. Park to kill it, and dress it for food  to himself, he, however, did not think it prudent to eat any part of  an animal so much detested by the Moors, and accordingly replied,  that he never ate the flesh of swine. They then untied the hog, in  hopes that it would run immediately at him, the Moors believing that  a great enmity subsists between hogs and Christians, but the animal  no sooner regained his liberty, than he attacked every person he met,  and at last took shelter under the king's couch. Mr. Park was then  conducted to the tent of Ali's chief slave, but was not permitted to  enter, nor touch any of the furniture. A little boiled corn, with  salt and water, was afterwards served him for supper, and he lay upon  a mat spread upon the sand, surrounded by the curious multitude.    The next day, Mr. Park was conducted by the king's order, to a hut  constructed of corn stalks of a square form, and a flat roof,  supported by forked sticks; but out of derision to the Christian, Ali  had ordered the wild hog before mentioned to be tied to one of the  sticks, and it proved a very disagreeable inmate, the boys amusing  themselves by beating and irritating the animal. Mr. Park was also  again tormented by the curiosity of the Moors. He was obliged to take  off his stockings to exhibit his feet, and even his jacket and  waistcoat to show them the mode of his toilet. This exercise he was  obliged to repeat the whole day. About eight o'clock in the evening,  Ali sent him some kouskous and salt and water, being the only  victuals he had tasted since the morning. During the night, the Moors  kept a regular watch, and frequently looked into the hut to see if he  was asleep. About two o'clock a Moor entered the hut, probably with a  view of stealing something, and groping about, laid his hand upon Mr.  Park's shoulder. He immediately sprang up, and the Moor in a hurry,  fell upon the wild hog, which returned the attack by biting his arm.  The cries of the Moor alarmed his countrymen, who conjecturing their  prisoner had made his escape, prepared for pursuit. Ali did not sleep  in his own tent, but came galloping upon a white horse from a tent at  a considerable distance; the consciousness of his tyrannical and  cruel behaviour had made him so suspicious, that even his own  domestics knew not where he slept. The cause of the outcry being  explained, the prisoner was allowed to sleep until morning without  further disturbance.    With the returning day, the boys, says Mr. Park, assembled to beat  the hog, and the men and women to plague the Christian. On this  subject, Mr. Park expresses himself most feelingly, for he adds, \"it  is impossible for me to describe the behaviour of a people, who study  mischief as a science, and exult in the miseries and misfortunes of  their fellow-creatures. It is sufficient to observe, that the  rudeness, ferocity, and fanaticism, which distinguish the Moors from  the rest of mankind, found here a proper subject whereon to exercise  their propensities. I was a _stranger_, I was _unprotected_, and I  was a _Christian_, each of these circumstances is sufficient to drive  every spark of humanity from the heart of a Moor; but when all of  them, as in my case, were combined in the same person, and a  suspicion prevailed withal, that I was come as a spy into the  country, the reader will easily imagine that, in such a situation, I  had every thing to fear. Anxious, however, to conciliate favour, I  patiently bore every insult, but never did any period of my life pass  so heavily; from sunrise to sunset was I obliged to suffer, with  unruffled countenance, the insults of the rudest savages on earth.\"    Mr. Park had now a new occupation thrust upon him, which was that of  a _barber_. His first display of official skill in his new capacity,  was in shaving the head of the young prince of Ludamar, in the  presence of the king, his father, but happening to make a slight  incision, the king ordered him to resign the razor, and walk out of  the tent. This was considered by Mr. Park as a very fortunate  circumstance, as he had determined to make himself as useless and  insignificant as possible, being the only means of recovering his  liberty.    On the 18th of March, four Moors arrived from Jarra, with Johnson the  interpreter, having seized him before he knew of Mr. Park's  confinement, and brought with them the bundle of clothes left at  Daman Jumma's house. Johnson was led into All's tent and examined;  the bundle was opened, and Mr. Park was sent for, to explain the use  of the various contents. To Mr. Park's great satisfaction, however,  Johnson had committed his papers to the charge of one of Daman's  wives. The bundle was again tied up, and put into a large cowskin  bag. In the evening Ali sent to Mr. Park for the rest of his effects,  to secure them, according to the report of the messengers, _as there  were many thieves in the neighbourhood_. Every thing was accordingly  carried away, nor was he suffered to retain a single shirt. Ali,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"China, or the new colony; but, his  strength failing with his provisions, he grew faint, and, despairing of  meeting with any relief, he had just sense enough to reverse the written  instructions which had been calculated solely to carry him out, directing  him to keep the sun on a particular part of his body, varying according  to the time of the day. By this method he travelled eastward, and in a  direction that led him nearly to the head of George's river, where a few  people were settled; and, having one morning heard the report of a gun at  a distance, he endeavoured to walk towards it, but was unable to make  himself heard by hallooing, when night overtook him. Being faint and  wearied, he took a little flour, which he still had in his pocket, and  sprinkling it on some fresh water, drank it, and laid himself down to  rest. In the morning, being somewhat refreshed, he again exerted himself  to get forward in the direction whence the report of the gun had revived  him, and soon after heard a man's voice, upon which he hallooed again,  and to his infinite joy was answered. The man, who was one of the  settlers, took him to his house, recruited his spirits, and brought him  into the town. On being questioned how he found his way back, he said,  'that a paper compass which had been given him was of no utility; he  therefore kept his face toward the place where the sun came from; but if  the hord (sic) had not been on his side, he should have been lost, for he  had been two whole days without any food, except a little flour and  water.'    Among the public works that were carrying on during this month must be  reckoned the laying another floor in the granary at Parramatta; repairing  the military barracks, store-houses, and every brick building belonging  to government, which were so far decayed as to be scarcely able to  support their own weight. These repairs, which they had long been in want  of, and which if sooner attended to would have preserved them from the  ruin they were fast approaching, with the various other buildings that  were so essentially requisite, completely stood in the way of making any  exertions in clearing and cultivating land, and considerably added to the  expenses of the colony. At Sydney the tower of the second wind-mill was  begun; and on the 31st, the building being completed for its reception,  the public clock was set up, and, for the first time, announced the hour  to the inhabitants at Sydney. The shipwrights were employed in  constructing a flat-bottomed vessel for the carriage of planks, posts,  etc.    Some heavy rain fell in this month, which for the time retarded all  out-door work; but it came very opportunely for the maize, the growth of  which had been rather obstructed by the dry weather which preceded.

When Bennillong accompanied Governor Phillip to England in the year 1792,  he left a young wife to deplore his absence. The manners of savages, in  this instance, were found somewhat to resemble those of civilised life.  The lady surrendered to the importunities of a youthful lover, who, to  say the truth, had in some material points the advantage over Bennillong;  and of him she became so enamoured, that neither the entreaties, the  menaces, nor the presents* of her husband at his return, could induce her  to leave him. From that time, she was considered by every one, Bennillong  excepted, as the wife of Ca-ru-ay. He, finding himself neglected by other  females whose smiles he courted (after the fashion of his country  indeed), sometimes sought to balance the mortification by the forced  embraces of his wife; but, her screams generally bringing her lover or a  friend to her assistance, he was not often successful. In one of these  attempts, at this time, he came off with a severe wound in the head, the  lady and her lover laughing at the rage which it occasioned.    [* Vide Vol I Ch. XXIX p 367, viz: 'His inquiries were directed,  immediately on his arrival, after his wife Go-roo-bar-roo-bool-lo;  and her he found with Caruey. On producing a very fashionable  rose-coloured petticoat and jacket made of a coarse stuff,  accompanied with a gypsy bonnet of the same colour, she deserted her  lover, and followed her former husband. In a few days however, to the  surprise of every one, we saw the lady walking unencumbered with clothing  of any kind, and Bennillong was missing. Caruey was sought for, and we  heard that he had been severely beaten by Bennillong at Rose Bay, who  retained so much of our customs, that he made use of his fists instead of  the weapons of his country, to the great annoyance of Caruey, who would  have preferred meeting his rival fairly in the field armed with the spear  and the club. Caruey being much the younger man, the lady, every inch a  woman, followed her inclination, and Bennillong was compelled to yield  her without any further opposition. He seemed to have been satisfied with  the beating he had given Caruey, and hinted, that resting for the present  without a wife, he should look about him, and at some future period make  a better choice.']    The man who killed Mo-roo-bra had undergone a second attack from his  friends; and, though yet suffering from the wounds which he received in  the first affair, made a most excellent defence.    The governor having been informed, by some of the natives who dwelt in  the neighbourhood of the cow pasture plains, that several of the wild  cattle had been killed, and imagining this mischief to have been done by  some of the Irish convicts (who were nearly as wild themselves as the  cattle), a party of the military, with Hacking, a man well acquainted  with that part of the country, was sent out with orders to surprise, and  if possible to secure them. After being absent some days, they returned  and reported, that, having searched the country round, no traces were  seen of the cattle in any of the places where they had been accustomed to  range, nor did they meet with any white people; but the natives persisted  in asserting their having seen some of them among them, and added that  some of the calves had been run down by them. This was not impossible;  and the idea was somewhat strengthened, by their finding some short  spears pointed with the leg bone of the kangaroo, which were supposed to  be designed for stabbing the calves when caught. Although it was the  opinion of these people, that the cattle had quitted the part of the  country in which they had been so long known to graze, there was yet much  reason to believe that this was not the case; for, on visiting them, they  were not always to be found in one spot.    It will be sufficient to state the following circumstance, to show the  unpleasant and distressing situation of the principal officer of the  settlement, by the construction that was put on his endeavours to rectify  every abuse that the inhabitants might labour under.    An infamous and seditious anonymous paper was dropped in the streets, in  which the governor and every officer in the colony were most scurrilously  abused and libelled, and accused of practising extortions in the way of  trade. This would not have been misplaced, had the abuse been confined  to the description of persons who really deserved it, and truth had been  attended to, which would have afforded them ample materials. But,  although it must have been evident to every one who had sense to see it,  that the governor, from the hour of his arrival, had used his utmost  endeavours to put an end to the practice of so much imposition; yet this  libeller inferred, from his not succeeding, that he was become one in the  number of retail traders who disgraced the settlement.    A reward was immediately offered for the discovery of the offender; but,  as might have been expected, without success.    The three persons who had been sent out with the Irishmen, that were so  desirous of discovering a country wherein they might live more at their  ease, returned on the 9th, so much exhausted with fatigue that two of  them were scarcely able to move when they arrived. Wilson, who was the  third, having been longer in the habit of travelling through the woods,  kept up their spirits, and thereby enabled them to reach Prospect Hill  about sunset; where, from long abstinence, having had nothing to support  them for several days, except two or three small birds, the refreshment  which they procured had nearly overcome them. Such were the difficulties  attending excursions in the interior of this country. With Wilson, who  knew much of the country, and was well qualified to conduct the party,  the governor sent a lad, a free servant of his, who was capable of giving  an account of the occurrences of the journey; and from him the following  particulars were collected:    From Mount Hunter (which was the highest land then known in that part of  the country, and distant from the township of Parramatta from about 30 to  34 miles in a SW direction) they took their departure on the 24th of last  month, travelling in a SSW course for 18 miles, 12 of which laid through  a fine open country. There they fell in with the river Nepean, which was  found winding to the southward and westward, close behind the cow pasture  plains. The banks of the river being at this place exceedingly steep and  rocky, they had some difficulty in getting across. On the other side the  ground wore a barren, unpromising appearance; and during the day they saw  only a few "]]]
