To Ralph Luffa's foundation of the dean's office he  added those of the chancellor and treasurer, if not also, as is  supposed, that of the praecentor. With Hilary began the traditional  post of confessor to the queen of the realm. Stephen had given him  this office, and at the same time added to the privilege a perpetual  chaplaincy in connection with the castle at Pevensey.    The letters from Popes Eugenius and Alexander III., which confirmed  the possessions held by the see and guaranteed a papal protection of  the church in Chichester, are among the collection in the cathedral  library. The properties these deeds acknowledge include that portion  of the city--one fourth--in which the close was situated; and within  this area were comprised the church itself, the episcopal palace, and  the residences of the canons. The original grant of this land was  made by William, Earl of Arundel, in 1147, who bestowed it among other  things as compensation \"for the damages which I once did to the same  church.\" Hilary was Bishop of Chichester during that historic period  when Becket opposed Henry II. He attempted, like the rest of the  bishops, to heal the breach; and Tennyson, in \"Becket,\" adopting a  phrase he used, makes him say to his Primate, \"Hath not thine ambition  set the Church this day between the hammer and the anvil ... fealty to  the King, obedience to thyself?\" He went to Sens, to plead as an  advocate on the king's behalf before Pope Alexander III. and the  French king. The result of this meeting was that England was placed  under the ban of excommunication. But Henry replied by declaring that  the property of all who acted upon it should be confiscated and  themselves banished. The bishop was involved also in a local contest  with the Abbot of Battle, who refused to consider himself subject to  his episcopal jurisdiction.    After Hilary's death in 1169 the revenues of the see were for four  years appropriated to his own uses by the king, who late in the year  1173 appointed #John Greenford# (1174-1180), who was Dean of  Chichester, to the vacancy. The bishop-elect was not consecrated  until, in 1174, he, with three more nominated about the same time, had  done penance before Becket's tomb at Canterbury. Little is known of  him except that he attended some ecclesiastical councils.    The episcopate of #Seffrid II.# (1180-1204) introduces an important  period of activity, during which great alterations were made in the  fabric of the cathedral.    #Simon Fitz Robert#, or #Simon of Wells# (1204-1207), was a  bishop whose favour with the king (John) enabled him to do much for  the see. He had held a post in the Royal Exchequer, and had been  guardian of the Fleet Prison as well as Provost of Beverley and  Archdeacon of Wells. The benefactions he obtained were various. A  charter was granted by which the see should hold its property free  from impost, under the protection of the king. The bishop, with his  dean and chapter, were practically exempted from the jurisdiction of  the local civil courts and from the payment of customs and tolls  within the same sphere. Within the bounds of the property owned by  the see they were to rule without restraint, and in the presence of a  royal official \"the view of Frank Pledge was to be held in the  bishop's court.\" In the patent rolls of King John there are two  entries, dated 1205 A.D. and 1206 A.D., by which the bishop was  granted permission to take Purbeck marble for the repair of his church  without hindrance, from the coast of Dorset to Chichester. [32] But  precautions were taken to prevent any of the material thus obtained  from being used elsewhere. A further grant, the evidence of which is  now removed, allowed the chapter to build premises beyond the  precincts northward, which encroached twelve feet into the roadway now  known as West Street. A row of lime-trees now stands where these  houses remained till the middle of the last century. For six years  after Simon's death John kept the see vacant, and during the interim  enjoyed the temporalities.      [32] See Walcott, p. 15, note _c_, May 24th, 1207.    #Richard Poore# was then consecrated bishop in 1215. He had been  Dean of Old Sarum. But after occupying the see for no more than two  years, he was translated to Salisbury.    #Ranulf of Warham# (1217-1224) bequeathed some property to the  see [33]; but otherwise he did little, except as a fortunate collector  of cattle, for the support of which his successor provided pasturage.      [33] Stephens, p. 57.    #Ralph Neville# (1224-1244) was a bishop of more than local  celebrity. Like Langton, the archbishop, he withstood the demands  which the papacy and Henry III. made in their endeavours to impoverish  the Church in England. For this opposition the king removed him  temporarily from the post of Chancellor of the Realm, a position he  held from 1226 to 1240. His \"fame rests more upon his repute as a  statesman faithful in many perils, and a singular pillar of truth in  the affairs of the kingdom.\" [34] He succeeded in procuring the payment  to the Church of tithe from some royal properties which had been  withheld, and left provision for the supply of twelve quarters of  wheat annually to the poor in Chichester. Some, notes preserved in the  cathedral records lead to the supposition that the portion of the old  central tower above the roof and up to the parapet at the foot of the  spire was built, or at least begun, during Ralph's tenure of the see.  One of these memoranda shows that he released from twenty days'  penance those who should visit the cathedral and contribute to the  maintenance of the fabric. The others state that he expended one  hundred and thirty marks upon repairs, and his executors paid over one  hundred and forty marks to the dean and chapter for the purpose of  finishing a stone tower which it had been found necessary to  repair. [35] Three years after his death it was nearly completed.  Bishop Neville died at his house by Chancellor's Lane, now Chancery  Lane. His property later passed into the hands of the Earl of Lincoln,  and was known then as the inn, or hospital, of Lincoln. The estate is  now covered by the buildings of Lincoln's Inn, [36] and that portion  which is still the property of the see is known as \"The Chichester  Rents.\"      [34] Matt. Paris.    [35] See Walcott, p. 15, note _c_.    [36] See Stephens, p. 61, cf. Murray's \"Chichester.\"    Ralph's successor was Richard of Wych (1245-1253), generally called  St. Richard. He had studied under Edmund and Grosseteste at Oxford,  and also in Paris and Bologna. Returning from Europe, he became  Chancellor of the University of Oxford, then of the diocese of  Canterbury. Having withdrawn again to France, he was ordained priest  at Orleans, and then worked as vicar at Deal, from which post he was  called upon to occupy again his earlier office at Canterbury. Then  came his appointment to Chichester. The canons had elected Robert  Passelew, but the archbishop objected. Henry III., having supported  the first nominee, disputed Richard's election. Meanwhile the king  appropriated the temporalities for two years. Richard appealed to  Innocent IV., who confirmed the appointment and consecrated Richard at  Lyons in 1245. This did not end the difference, for on the new  bishop's return he was obliged to accept the hospitality of his  clergy, the king being still hostile. But he did not allow these  difficulties to interfere with his attention to episcopal duty, for he  walked throughout the diocese, organising and teaching as he went. In  his leisure he followed the pursuits of his youth, and spent his spare  time in farming and gardening. He was an excellent man, whose peculiar  sanctity rests largely upon his having succeeded in doing the duties  some of his predecessors had disregarded, and for a generosity which  outran his income. Accepting that law which the papacy had added to  those of Christianity, he treated the married clergy with the severity  his sense of duty and obedience urged, for he deprived them of their  benefices, and their wives were denied the offices of the Church both  before and after death. Any bequests to them by their husbands, he  declared, should be confiscated, and the funds derived by this means  devoted to the needs of the cathedral building Rather inconsistently  he taught the beneficed clergy that they should use hospitality and  charity; but like another Malachi, he reminded men that to withhold  the tithe of their increase from the Church made them robbers not of  the clergy, but of their Creator. He instituted the fund afterwards  known as \"S. Richard's Pence.\" It was a system by which regular  offerings should be made for the completion and maintenance of the  cathedral fabric. And, characteristically, he obtained the support of  the archbishop and seven other prelates in their approval of his wish  that they should \"recommend visits and offerings to Chichester, for  the repair and completion of the cathedral.\" This is another evidence  of the great extent of those building operations that were in progress  throughout the thirteenth century. Just before his death he began to  preach a crusade, but died at Dover. In his will he still remembered  the cathedral by leaving a legacy of forty pounds for the needs of the  fabric.    #John of Clymping# (1253-1262) succeeded Richard. His episcopate  appears chiefly remarkable for the growth of stories about the  miraculous powers and saintly life of his predecessor.    #Stephen of Berghsted# (1262-1288) now occupied the see. During his  episcopate Richard was canonised, a deputation, sent at great cost to  Rome, having succeeded in persuading Urban IV. that his merits and  fame deserved an honour which should bring wealth and celebrity to the  see in whose cathedral his body was laid; so in 1276 the remains of  his body were removed from their tomb and placed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#19)"],[1,"a slight breathlessness from  exertion would permit, \"or you die.\"    There was no menace in the manner of this demand; that was all in the  matter and in the means of enforcing it. There was, too, something not  altogether reassuring in the cold gray eyes that glanced along the  barrel of the weapon. For a moment the two men stood looking at each  other in silence; then the civilian, with no appearance of fear--with as  great apparent unconcern as when complying with the less austere demand  of the sentinel--slowly pulled from his pocket the paper which had  satisfied that humble functionary and held it out, saying:    \"I reckon this 'ere parss from Mister Hartroy is--\"    \"The pass is a forgery,\" the officer said, interrupting. \"I am Captain  Hartroy--and you are Dramer Brune.\"    It would have required a sharp eye to observe the slight pallor of the  civilian's face at these words, and the only other manifestation  attesting their significance was a voluntary relaxation of the thumb and  fingers holding the dishonored paper, which, falling to the road,  unheeded, was rolled by a gentle wind and then lay still, with a coating  of dust, as in humiliation for the lie that it bore. A moment later the  civilian, still looking unmoved into the barrel of the pistol, said:    \"Yes, I am Dramer Brune, a Confederate spy, and your prisoner. I have on  my person, as you will soon discover, a plan of your fort and its  armament, a statement of the distribution of your men and their number,  a map of the approaches, showing the positions of all your outposts. My  life is fairly yours, but if you wish it taken in a more formal way than  by your own hand, and if you are willing to spare me the indignity of  marching into camp at the muzzle of your pistol, I promise you that I  will neither resist, escape, nor remonstrate, but will submit to  whatever penalty may be imposed.\"    The officer lowered his pistol, uncocked it, and thrust it into its  place in his belt. Brune advanced a step, extending his right hand.    \"It is the hand of a traitor and a spy,\" said the officer coldly, and  did not take it. The other bowed.    \"Come,\" said the captain, \"let us go to camp; you shall not die until  to-morrow morning.\"    He turned his back upon his prisoner, and these two enigmatical men  retraced their steps and soon passed the sentinel, who expressed his  general sense of things by a needless and exaggerated salute to his  commander.    IV    Early on the morning after these events the two men, captor and captive,  sat in the tent of the former. A table was between them on which lay,  among a number of letters, official and private, which the captain had  written during the night, the incriminating papers found upon the spy.  That gentleman had slept through the night in an adjoining tent,  unguarded. Both, having breakfasted, were now smoking.    \"Mr. Brune,\" said Captain Hartroy, \"you probably do not understand why I  recognized you in your disguise, nor how I was aware of your name.\"    \"I have not sought to learn, Captain,\" the prisoner said with quiet  dignity.    \"Nevertheless I should like you to know--if the story will not offend.  You will perceive that my knowledge of you goes back to the autumn of  1861. At that time you were a private in an Ohio regiment--a brave and  trusted soldier. To the surprise and grief of your officers and comrades  you deserted and went over to the enemy. Soon afterward you were  captured in a skirmish, recognized, tried by court-martial and sentenced  to be shot. Awaiting the execution of the sentence you were confined,  unfettered, in a freight car standing on a side track of a railway.\"    \"At Grafton, Virginia,\" said Brune, pushing the ashes from his cigar  with the little finger of the hand holding it, and without looking up.    \"At Grafton, Virginia,\" the captain repeated. \"One dark and stormy night  a soldier who had just returned from a long, fatiguing march was put on  guard over you. He sat on a cracker box inside the car, near the door,  his rifle loaded and the bayonet fixed. You sat in a corner and his  orders were to kill you if you attempted to rise.\"    \"But if I _asked_ to rise he might call the corporal of the guard.\"    \"Yes. As the long silent hours wore away the soldier yielded to the  demands of nature: he himself incurred the death penalty by sleeping at  his post of duty.\"    \"You did.\"    \"What! you recognize me? you have known me all along?\"    The captain had risen and was walking the floor of his tent, visibly  excited. His face was flushed, the gray eyes had lost the cold, pitiless  look which they had shown when Brune had seen them over the pistol  barrel; they had softened wonderfully.    \"I knew you,\" said the spy, with his customary tranquillity, \"the moment  you faced me, demanding my surrender. In the circumstances it would have  been hardly becoming in me to recall these matters. I am perhaps a  traitor, certainly a spy; but I should not wish to seem a suppliant.\"    The captain had paused in his walk and was facing his prisoner. There  was a singular huskiness in his voice as he spoke again.    \"Mr. Brune, whatever your conscience may permit you to be, you saved my  life at what you must have believed the cost of your own. Until I saw  you yesterday when halted by my sentinel I believed you dead--thought  that you had suffered the fate which through my own crime you might  easily have escaped. You had only to step from the car and leave me to  take your place before the firing-squad. You had a divine compassion.  You pitied my fatigue. You let me sleep, watched over me, and as the  time drew near for the relief-guard to come and detect me in my crime,  you gently waked me. Ah, Brune, Brune, that was well done--that was  great--that--\"    The captain's voice failed him; the tears were running down his face and  sparkled upon his beard and his breast. Resuming his seat at the table,  he buried his face in his arms and sobbed. All else was silence.    Suddenly the clear warble of a bugle was heard sounding the \"assembly.\"  The captain started and raised his wet face from his arms; it had turned  ghastly pale. Outside, in the sunlight, were heard the stir of the men  falling into line; the voices of the sergeants calling the roll; the  tapping of the drummers as they braced their drums. The captain spoke  again:    \"I ought to have confessed my fault in order to relate the story of your  magnanimity; it might have procured you a pardon. A hundred times I  resolved to do so, but shame prevented. Besides, your sentence was just  and righteous. Well, Heaven forgive me! I said nothing, and my regiment  was soon afterward ordered to Tennessee and I never heard about you.\"    \"It was all right, sir,\" said Brune, without visible emotion; \"I escaped  and returned to my colors--the Confederate colors. I should like to add  that before deserting from the Federal service I had earnestly asked a  discharge, on the ground of altered convictions. I was answered by  punishment.\"    \"Ah, but if I had suffered the penalty of my crime--if you had not  generously given me the life that I accepted without gratitude you would  not be again in the shadow and imminence of death.\"    The prisoner started slightly and a look of anxiety came into his face.  One would have said, too, that he was surprised. At that moment a  lieutenant, the adjutant, appeared at the opening of the tent and  saluted. \"Captain,\" he said, \"the battalion is formed.\"    Captain Hartroy had recovered his composure. He turned to the officer  and said: \"Lieutenant, go to Captain Graham and say that I direct him to  assume command of the battalion and parade it outside the parapet. This  gentleman is a deserter and a spy; he is to be shot to death in the  presence of the troops. He will accompany you, unbound and unguarded.\"    While the adjutant waited at the door the two men inside the tent rose  and exchanged ceremonious bows, Brune immediately retiring.    Half an hour later an old negro cook, the only person left in camp  except the commander, was so startled by the sound of a volley of  musketry that he dropped the kettle that he was lifting from a fire. But  for his consternation and the hissing which the contents of the kettle  made among the embers, he might also have heard, nearer at hand, the  single pistol shot with which Captain Hartroy renounced the life which  in conscience he could no longer keep.    In compliance with the terms of a note that he left for the officer who  succeeded him in command, he was buried, like the deserter and spy,  without military honors; and in the solemn shadow of the mountain which  knows no more of war the two sleep well in long-forgotten graves.          ONE KIND OF OFFICER    I    OF THE USES OF CIVILITY    \"Captain Ransome, it is not permitted to you to know _anything_. It is  sufficient that you obey my order--which permit me to repeat. If you  perceive any movement of troops in your front you are to open fire, and  if attacked hold this position as long as you can. Do I make myself  understood, sir?\"    \"Nothing could be plainer. Lieutenant Price,\"--this to an officer of his  own battery, who had ridden up in time to hear the order--\"the general's  meaning is clear, is it not?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    The lieutenant passed on to his post. For a moment General Cameron and  the commander of the battery sat in their saddles, looking at each other  in silence. There was no more to say; apparently too much had already  been said. Then the superior officer nodded coldly and turned his horse  to ride away. The artillerist saluted slowly, gravely, and with extreme  formality. One acquainted with the niceties of military etiquette would  have said that by his manner he attested a sense of the rebuke that he  had incurred. It is one of the important uses of civility to signify  resentment.    When the general had joined his staff and escort, awaiting him at a  little"]]]
