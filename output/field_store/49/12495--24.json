Serve for breakfast or  lunch, giving a slice to each person with gravy served with it.      CHICKEN TURNOVERS.    Chop cold roast chicken very fine. Put it into a saucepan, place it  over the fire, moisten it with a little water and gravy, or a piece of  butter. Season with salt and pepper; add a small tablespoonful of  sifted flour dissolved in a little water; heat all through and remove  from the fire to become cool. When cooled roll out some plain  pie-crust quite thin, cut out in rounds as large as a saucer; wet the  edge with cold water and put a large spoonful of the minced meat on  one-half of the round; fold the other half over and pinch the edges  well together, then fry them in hot drippings or fat a nice brown.  They may also be cooked in a moderate oven.      CHICKEN PUDDING.    Cut up two young chickens into good-sized pieces; put them in a  saucepan with just enough water to cover them well. When boiled quite  tender, season with salt and pepper; let them simmer ten or fifteen  minutes longer; then take the chicken from the broth and remove all  the large bones. Place the meat in a well-buttered pudding dish,  season again, if necessary, adding a few bits of butter. Pour over  this the following batter:--    Eight eggs beaten light and mixed with one quart of milk, three  tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt and two large  teaspoonfuls of baking powder, added to enough sifted flour to make a  batter like griddle-cakes.    Bake one hour in a _moderate_ oven.    Make a gravy of the broth that remained from the cooking of the  chicken, adding a tablespoonful of flour stirred into a third of a cup  of melted butter; let it boil up, putting in more water if necessary.  Serve hot in a gravy boat with the pudding.      CHICKEN AND MACARONI.    Boil a chicken until very tender, take out all the bones, and pick up  the meat quite fine. Boil half a pound of macaroni until tender, first  breaking it up to pieces an inch long. Butter a deep pudding dish, put  on the bottom a layer of the cooked macaroni, then a layer of the  minced chicken, bits of butter, pepper and salt, then some of the  chicken liquor, over this put another layer of macaroni, and so on,  until, the dish is filled. Pour a cup of cream over the whole, and  bake half an hour. Serve on a platter.      ROAST DUCK. (Tame.)    Pick, draw, clean thoroughly, and wipe dry. Cut the neck close to the  back, beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling pin, tie the wings and  legs securely, and stuff with the following:--    Three pints bread crumbs, six ounces butter, or part butter and salt  pork, two chopped onions and one teaspoonful each of sage, black  pepper and salt. Do not stuff very full, and sew up the openings  firmly to keep the flavor in and the fat out. If not fat enough, it  should be larded with salt pork, or tie a slice upon the breast. Place  in a baking pan, with a little water, and baste frequently with salt  and water--some add onion, and some vinegar; turn often, so that the  sides and back may all be nicely browned. When nearly done, baste with  butter and a little flour. These directions will apply to tame geese  as well as ducks. Young ducks should roast from twenty-five to thirty  minutes, and full-grown ones for an hour or more, with frequent  basting. Some prefer them underdone and served very hot; but, as a  rule, thorough cooking will prove more palatable. Make a gravy out of  the necks and gizzards by putting them in a quart of cold water, that  must be reduced to a pint by boiling. The giblets, when done, may be  chopped fine and added to the juice. The preferred seasonings are one  tablespoonful of Madeira or sherry, a blade of mace, one small onion,  and a little cayenne pepper; strain through a hair sieve; pour a  little over the ducks and serve the remainder in a boat. Served with  jellies or any tart sauce.      BRAISED DUCK.    Prepare a pair of fine young ducks, the same as for roasting, place  them in a stewpan together with two or three slices of bacon, a  carrot, an onion stuck with two cloves, and a little thyme and  parsley. Season with pepper, and cover the whole with a broth, adding  to the broth a gill of white wine. Place the pan over a gentle fire  and allow the ducks to simmer until done, basting them frequently.  When done remove them from the pan, and place them where they will  keep hot. A turnip should then be cut up and fried in some butter.  When nicely browned, drain the pieces and cook them until tender in  the liquor in which the ducks were braised. Now strain and thicken the  gravy, and after dishing up the ducks, pour it over them, garnishing  with the pieces of turnip.    _Palmer House, Chicago._      STEWED DUCK.    Prepare them by cutting them up the same as chicken for fricassee. Lay  two or three very thin slices of salt pork upon the bottom of a  stewpan; lay the pieces of duck upon the pork. Let them stew slowly  for an hour, closely covered. Then season with salt and pepper, half a  teaspoonful of powdered sage, or some green sage minced fine; one  chopped onion. Stew another half hour until the duck is tender. Stir  up a large tablespoonful of brown flour in a little water and add it  to the stew. Let it boil up, and serve all together in one dish,  accompanied with green peas.    _Palmer House, Chicago._      DUCK PIE.    Cut all the meat from cold roast ducks; put the bones and stuffing  into cold water; cover them and let boil; put the meat into a deep  dish; pour on enough of the stock made from the bones to moisten;  cover with pastry slit in the centre with a knife, and bake a light  brown.      WARMED UP DUCK.    A nice dish for breakfast, and very relishing, can be made from the  remains of a roast of duck. Cut the meat from the bones, pick out all  the little tidbits in the recesses, lay them in a frying pan, and  cover with water and the cold gravy left from the roast; add a piece  of butter; let all boil up once and if not quite thick enough, stir in  a little dissolved flour. Serve hot.      ROAST WILD DUCK.    Wild duck should not be dressed too soon after being killed. If the  weather is cold it will be better for being kept several days. Bake in  a hot oven, letting it remain for five or ten minutes without basting  to keep in the gravy, then baste frequently with butter and water. If  over-done it loses flavor, thirty to forty minutes in the right kind  of an oven being sufficient. Serve on a very hot dish, and send to  table as hot as possible with a cut lemon and the following sauce:--    Put in a tiny saucepan a tablespoonful each of Worcestershire sauce  and mushroom catsup, a little salt and cayenne pepper and the juice of  half a lemon. Mix well, make it hot, remove from the fire and stir in  a teaspoonful of made mustard. Pour into a hot gravy boat.    _California Style, Lick House._      WILD DUCKS.    Most wild ducks are apt to have the flavor of fish, and when in the  hands of inexperienced cooks are sometimes unpalatable on this  account. Before roasting them, parboil them with a small peeled carrot  put within each duck. This absorbs the unpleasant taste. An onion will  have the same effect, but unless you use onions in the stuffing the  carrot is preferable. Roast the same as tame duck. Or put into the  duck a whole onion peeled, plenty of salt and pepper and a glass of  claret, bake in a hot oven twenty minutes. Serve hot with the gravy it  yields in cooking and a dish of currant jelly.      CANVAS-BACK DUCK.    The epicurean taste declares that this special kind of bird requires  no spices or flavors to make it perfect, as the meat partakes of the  flavor of the food that the bird feeds upon, being mostly wild celery;  and the delicious flavor is best preserved when roasted quickly with a  hot fire. After dressing the duck in the usual way by plucking,  singeing, drawing, wipe it with a wet towel, truss the head under the  wing; place it in a dripping-pan, put it in the oven, basting often,  and roast it half an hour. It is generally preferred a little  underdone. Place it when done on a hot dish, season well with salt and  pepper, pour over it the gravy it has yielded in baking and serve it  immediately while hot.    _Delmonico._      ROAST PIGEONS.    Pigeons lose their flavor by being kept more than a day after they are  killed. They may be prepared and roasted or broiled the same as  chickens; they will require from twenty to thirty minutes' cooking.  Make a gravy of the giblets or not, season it with pepper and salt,  and add a little flour and butter.      STEWED PIGEONS.    Clean and stuff with onion dressing, thyme, etc.,--do not sew up; take  five or more slices of corned pork, let it fry a while in a pot so  that the fat comes out and it begins to brown a little; then lay the  pigeons all around in the fat, leaving the pork still in; add hot  water enough to partially cover them; cover tightly and boil an hour  or so until tender; then turn off some of the liquid, and keep turning  them so they will brown nicely; then heat and add the liquor poured  off; add extra thyme, pepper, and keep turning until the pigeons and  gravy are nicely browned. Thicken with a little flour, and serve with  the gravy poured over them; garnish with parsley.      PIGEON PIE.    Take half a dozen pigeons; stuff each one with a dressing the same as  for turkey; loosen the joints with a knife, but do not separate them.  Put them in a stewpan with water enough to cover them, let them cook  until nearly tender, then season them with salt and pepper and butter.  Thicken the gravy with flour, remove and cool. Butter a pudding dish,  line the sides with a rich crust. Have ready some hard-boiled eggs cut  in slices. Put in a layer of egg and birds and gravy until the dish is  full. Cover with a crust and bake.      BROILED PIGEONS OR SQUABS.

I remember ... Jack's goin' to drive you to Kremmlin' an'  ther take stage fer Denver. I allow you'd better put in your best licks  on fixin' up an' packin' the clothes you'll need. Women-folk naturally  want to look smart on weddin'-trips.\"    \"Dad!\" exclaimed Columbine, in dismay. \"I never thought of clothes. And  I don't want to leave White Slides.\"    \"But, lass, you're goin' to be married!\" expostulated Belllounds.    \"Didn't it occur to Jack to take me to Kremmling? I can't make new  dresses out of old ones.\"    \"Wal, I reckon neither of us thought of thet. But you can buy what you  like in Denver.\"    Columbine resigned herself. After all, what did it matter to her? The  vague, haunting dreams of girlhood would never come true. So she went to  her wardrobe and laid out all her wearing apparel. Taking stock of it  this way caused her further dismay, for she had nothing fit to wear in  which either to be married or to take a trip to Denver. There appeared  to be nothing to do but take the rancher's advice, and Columbine set  about refurbishing her meager wardrobe. She sewed all day.    What with self-control and work and the passing of hours, Columbine  began to make some approach to tranquillity. In her simplicity she even  began to hope that being good and steadfast and dutiful would earn her a  little meed of happiness. Some haunting doubt of this flashed over her  mind like a swift shadow of a black wing, but she dispelled that as she  had dispelled the fear and disgust which often rose up in her mind.    To Columbine's surprise and to the rancher's concern the prospective  bridegroom did not return from Kremmling on the second day. When night  came Belllounds reluctantly gave up looking for him.    Jack's non-appearance suited Columbine, and she would have been glad to  be let alone until October first, which date now seemed appallingly  close. On the afternoon of Jack's third day of absence from the ranch  Columbine rode out for some needed exercise. Pronto not being available,  she rode another mustang and one that kept her busy. On the way back to  the ranch she avoided the customary trail which led by the cabins of  Wade and the cowboys. Columbine had not seen one of her friends since  the unfortunate visit to the Andrews ranch. She particularly shrank from  meeting Wade, which feeling was in strange contrast to her  former impulses.    As she rode around the house she encountered Wilson Moore seated in a  light wagon. Her mustang reared, almost unseating her. But she handled  him roughly, being suddenly surprised and angry at this unexpected  meeting with the cowboy.    \"Howdy, Columbine!\" greeted Wilson, as she brought the mustang to his  feet. \"You're sure learning to handle a horse--since I left this here  ranch. Wonder who's teaching you! I never could get you to rake even  a bronc!\"    The cowboy had drawled out his admiring speech, half amused and half  satiric.    \"I'm--mad!\" declared Columbine. \"That's why.\"    \"What're you mad at?\" queried Wilson.    She did not reply, but kept on gazing steadily at him. Moore still  looked pale and drawn, but he had improved since last she saw him.    \"Aren't you going to speak to a fellow?\" he went on.    \"How are you, Wils?\" she asked.    \"Pretty good for a club-footed has-been cow puncher.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't call yourself such names,\" rejoined Columbine,  peevishly. \"You're not a club-foot. I hate that word!\"    \"Me, too. Well, joking aside, I'm better. My foot is fine. Now, if I  don't hurt it again I'll sure never be a club-foot.\"    \"You must be careful,\" she said, earnestly.    \"Sure. But it's hard for me to be idle. Think of me lying still all day  with nothing to do but read! That's what knocked me out. I wouldn't have  minded the pain if I could have gotten about.... Columbine, I've  moved in!\"    \"What! Moved in?\" she queried, blankly.    \"Sure. I'm in my cabin on the hill. It's plumb great. Tom Andrews and  Bert and your hunter Wade fixed up the cabin for me. That Wade is sure a  good fellow. And say! what he can do with his hands! He's been kind to  me. Took an interest in me, and between you and me he sort of  cheered me up.\"    \"Cheered you up! Wils, were you unhappy?\" she asked, directly.    \"Well, rather. What'd you expect of a cowboy who'd crippled  himself--and lost his girl?\"    Columbine felt the smart of tingling blood in her face, and she looked  from Wilson to the wagon. It contained saddles, blankets, and other  cowboy accoutrements for which he had evidently come.    \"That's a double misfortune,\" she replied, evenly. \"It's too bad both  came at once. It seems to me if I were a cowboy and--and felt so toward  a girl, I'd have let her know.\"    \"This girl I mean knew, all right,\" he said, nodding his head.    \"She didn't--she didn't!\" cried Columbine.    \"How do you know?\" he queried, with feigned surprise. He was bent upon  torturing her.    \"You meant me. I'm the girl you lost!\"    \"Yes, you are--God help me!\" replied Moore, with genuine emotion.    \"But you--you never told me--you never told me,\" faltered Columbine, in  distress.    \"Never told you what? That you were my girl?\"    \"No--no. But that you--you cared--\"    \"Columbine Belllounds, I told you--let you see--in every way under the  sun,\" he flashed at her.    \"Let me see--what?\" faltered Columbine, feeling as if the world were  about to end.    \"That I loved you.\"    \"Oh!... Wilson!\" whispered Columbine, wildly.    \"Yes--loved you. Could you have been so innocent--so blind you never  knew? I can't believe it.\"    \"But I never dreamed you--you--\" She broke off dazedly, overwhelmed by a  tragic, glorious truth.    \"Collie!... Would it have made any difference?\"    \"Oh, all the difference in the world!\" she wailed.    \"What difference?\" he asked, passionately.    Columbine gazed wide-eyed and helpless at the young man. She did not  know how to tell him what all the difference in the world really was.    Suddenly Wilson turned away from her to listen. Then she heard rapid  beating of hoofs on the road.    \"That's Buster Jack,\" said the cowboy. \"Just my luck! There wasn't any  one here when I arrived. Reckon I oughtn't have stayed. Columbine, you  look pretty much upset.\"    \"What do I care how I look!\" she exclaimed, with a sharp resentment  attending this abrupt and painful break in her agitation.    Next moment Jack Belllounds galloped a foam-lashed horse into the  courtyard and hauled up short with a recklessness he was noted for. He  swung down hard and violently cast the reins from him.    \"Ahuh! I gambled on just this,\" he declared, harshly.    Columbine's heart sank. His gaze was fixed on her face, with its  telltale evidences of agitation.    \"What've you been crying about?\" he demanded.    \"I haven't been,\" she retorted.    His bold and glaring eyes, hot with sudden temper, passed slowly from  her to the cowboy. Columbine became aware then that Jack was under the  influence of liquor. His heated red face grew darker with a  sneering contempt.    \"Where's dad?\" he asked, wheeling toward her.    \"I don't know. He's not here,\" replied Columbine, dismounting. The leap  of thought and blood to Jack's face gave her a further sinking of the  heart. The situation unnerved her.    Wilson Moore had grown a shade paler. He gathered up his reins, ready to  drive off.    \"Belllounds, I came up after my things I'd left in the bunk,\" he said,  coolly. \"Happened to meet Columbine and stopped to chat a minute.\"    \"That's what _you_ say,\" sneered Belllounds. \"You were making love to  Columbine. I saw that in her face. You know it--and she knows it--and I  know it.... You're a liar!\"    \"Belllounds, I reckon I am,\" replied Moore, turning white. \"I did tell  Columbine what I thought she knew--what I ought to have told long ago.\"    \"Ahuh! Well, I don't want to hear it. But I'm going to search that  wagon.\"    \"What!\" ejaculated the cowboy, dropping his reins as if they stung him.    \"You just hold on till I see what you've got in there,\" went on  Belllounds, and he reached over into the wagon and pulled at a saddle.    \"Say, do you mean anything?... This stuff's mine, every strap of it.  Take your hands off.\"    Belllounds leaned on the wagon and looked up with insolent, dark intent.    \"Moore, I wouldn't trust you. I think you'd steal anything you got your  hands on.\"    Columbine uttered a passionate little cry of shame and protest.    \"Jack, how dare you!\"    \"You shut up! Go in the house!\" he ordered.    \"You insult me,\" she replied, in bitter humiliation.    \"Will you go in?\" he shouted.    \"No, I won't.\"    \"All right, look on, then. I'd just as lief have you.\" Then he turned to  the cowboy. \"Moore, show up that wagon-load of stuff unless you want me  to throw it out in the road.\"    \"Belllounds, you know I can't do that,\" replied Moore, coldly. \"And I'll  give you a hunch. You'd better shut up yourself and let me drive on....  If not for her sake, then for your own.\"    Belllounds grasped the reins, and with a sudden jerk pulled them out of  the cowboy's hands.    \"You damn club-foot! Your gift of gab doesn't go with me,\" yelled  Belllounds, as he swung up on the hub of the wheel. But it was manifest  that his desire to search the wagon was only a pretense, for while he  pulled at this and that his evil gaze was on the cowboy, keen to meet  any move that might give excuse for violence. Moore evidently read this,  for, gazing at Columbine, he shook his head, as if to acquaint her with  a situation impossible to help.    \"Columbine, please hand me up the reins,\" he said. \"I'm lame, you know.  Then I'll be going.\"    Columbine stepped forward to comply, when Belllounds, leaping down from  the wheel, pushed her hack with masterful hand. Opposition to him was  like waving a"]]]
