All parts of the world have contributed to their  number and every taste can find its preference among them. New forms  produced by the skill of the breeder are introduced every year. This has  been done mostly by crossing and intermingling the characters of  introduced species of the same genus. In some of the cases the history  of our flowers is so old that their hybrid origin is forgotten, as in  the case of the pansies. Hybridizations are still going on in other  groups on a large scale, and new forms are openly claimed to be of  hybrid origin.    Breeders and amateurs generally have more interest in the results than  in the way in which they have been brought about. Excellent flowers and  fruit recommend themselves and there seems to be no reason for inquiring  [122] about their origin. In some cases the name of the originator may  be so widely known that it adds weight to the value of the new form, and  therefore may advantageously be coupled with it. The origin and history  of the greater part of our garden-flowers, fruits and vegetables are  obscure; we see them as they are, and do not know from whence they came.  The original habitat for a whole genus or for a species at large, may be  known, but questions as to the origin of the single forms, of which it  is built up, ordinarily remain unanswered.    For these reasons we are restricted in most cases to the comparison of  the forms before us. This comparison has led to the general use of the  term \"variety\" in opposition to \"species.\" The larger groups of forms,  which are known to have been introduced as such are called species. All  forms which by their characters belong to such a species are designated  as varieties, irrespective of their systematic relation to the form,  considered as the ancestor of the group.    Hence, we distinguish between \"hybrid varieties\" and \"pure varieties\"  according to their origin from different parents or from a single line  of ancestors. Moreover, in both groups the forms may be propagated by  seeds, or in the vegetative way by buds, by grafting or [123] by  cutting, and this leads to the distinction of \"seed-varieties\" and  \"vegetative varieties.\" In the first case the inheritance of the special  characters through the seeds decides the status of the variety, in the  latter case this point is left wholly out of consideration.    Leaving aside all these different types, we are concerned here only with  the \"seed-varieties\" of pure origin, or at least with those, that are  supposed to be so. Hybridization and vegetative multiplication of the  hybrids no doubt occur in nature, but they are very rare, when compared  with the ordinary method of propagation by seed. \"Seed-varieties\" may  further be divided into constant and inconstant ones. The difference is  very essential, but the test is not always easy to apply. Constant  varieties are as sharply defined and as narrowly limited as are the best  wild species, while inconstant types are cultivated chiefly on account  of their wide range of form and color. This diversity is repeated  yearly, even from the purest seed. We will now discuss the constant  seed-varieties, leaving the inconstant and eversporting types to a  subsequent lecture.    In this way we may make an exact inquiry into the departures from the  species which are ordinarily considered to constitute the essential  character of such a constant and pure seed-variety [124] and need only  compare these differences with those that distinguish the elementary  species of one and the same group from each other.    Two points are very striking. By far the greatest part of the ordinary  garden-varieties differ from their species by a single sharp character  only. In derivative cases two, three or even more such characters may be  combined in one variety, for instance, a dwarfed variety of the larkspur  may at the same time bear white flowers, or even double white flowers,  but the individuality of the single characters is not in the least  obscured by such combinations.    The second point is the almost general occurrence of the same variety in  extended series of species. White and double flowers, variegated leaves,  dwarfs and many other instances may be cited. It is precisely this  universal repetition of the same character that strikes us as the  essential feature of a variety.    And again these two characteristics may now be considered separately.  Let us begin with the sharpness of the varietal characters. In this  respect varieties differ most obviously from elementary species. These  are distinguished from their nearest allies in almost all organs. There  is no prominent distinctive feature between the single forms of _Draba_  [125] _Verna_, _Helianthemum_ or of _Taraxacum_; all characters are  almost equally concerned. The elementary species of _Draba_ are  characterized, as we have seen, by the forms and the hairiness of the  leaves, the number and height of the flower-stalks, the breadth and  incision of the petals, the forms of the fruits, and so on. Every one of  the two hundred forms included in this collective species has its own  type, which it is impossible to express by a single term. Their names  are chosen arbitrarily. Quite the contrary is the case with most of the  varieties, for which one word ordinarily suffices to express the whole  difference.    White varieties of species with red or blue flowers are the most common  instances. If the species has a compound color and if only one of the  constituents is lost, partially colored types arise as in _Agrostemma  Coronaria bicolor_. Or the spots may disappear and the color become  uniform as in _Gentiana punctata concolor_ and the spotless Arum or  _Arum maculatum immaculatum_. Absence of hairs produces forms as  _Biscutella laevigata glabra_; lack of prickles gives the varieties  known as _inermis, as for instance, _Ranunculus arvensis inermis_.  _Cytisus prostratus_ has a variety _ciliata_, and _Solanum Dulcamara_,  or the bitter-sweet, has a variety called _tomentosum_. The curious  monophyllous [126] variety of the strawberry and many other forms will  be discussed later.    To enlarge this list it would only be necessary to extract from a flora,  or from a catalogue of horticultural plants, the names of the varieties  enumerated therein. In nearly every instance, where true varieties and  not elementary species are concerned, a single term expresses the whole  character.    Such a list would also serve to illustrate the second point since the  same names would recur frequently. Long lists of varieties are called  alba, or inermis, or canescens or lutea, and many genera contain the  same appellations. In some instances the systematists use a diversity of  names to convey exactly the same idea, as if to conceal the monotony of  the character, as for instance in the case of the lack of hairs, which  is expressed by the varietal names of _Papaver dubium glabrum_, _Arabis  ciliata glabrata_, _Arabis hirsuta glaberrima_, _Veronica spicata  nitens_, _Amygdalus persica laevis_, _Paeonia corallina Leiocarpa_, &c.    On the contrary we find elementary species in different genera based on  the greatest possible diversity of features. The forms of _Taraxacum_ or  _Helianthemum_ do not repeat those of _Draba_ or _Viola_. In roses and  brambles the distinguishing features are characteristic of the type, as  [127] they are evidently derived from it and limited to it. And this is  so true that nobody claims the grade of elementary species for white  roses or white brambles, but everyone recognizes that forms diverging  from the nearest species by a single character only, are to be regarded  as varieties.    This general conviction is the basis on which we may build up a more  sharply defined distinction between elementary species and varieties. It  is an old rule in systematic botany, that no form is to be constituted a  species upon the basis of a single character. All authors agree on this  point; specific differences are derived from the totality of the  attributes, not from one organ or one quality. This rule is intimately  connected with the idea that varieties are derived from species. The  species is the typical, really existing form from which the variety has  originated by a definite change. In enumerating the different forms the  species is distinguished by the term of genuine or typical, often only  indicated as _a_ or the first; then follow the varieties sometimes in  order of their degree of difference, sometimes simply in alphabetical  order. In the case of elementary species there is no real type; no one  of them predominates because all are considered to be equal in rank, and  the systematic species to which they [128] are referred is not a really  existing form, but is the abstraction of the common type of all, just as  it is in the case of a genus or of a family.    Summarizing the main points of this discussion, we find that elementary  species are of equal rank and together build up the collective or  systematic ideal species. Varieties on the other hand are derived from a  real and commonly, still existing type.    I hope that I have succeeded in showing that the difference between  elementary species, or, as they are often called, smaller or subspecies,  on the one hand and varieties on the other, is quite a marked one.  However, in order to recognize this principle it is necessary to limit  the term variety, to those propagating themselves by seed and are of  pure and not of hybrid origin.    But the principle as stated here, does not involve an absolute contrast  between two groups of characters. It is more a difference in our  knowledge and appreciation of them than a difference in the things  themselves. The characters of elementary species are, as a rule, new to  us, while those of varieties are old and familiar. It seems to me that  this is the essential point.

The British correspondents  were collected in the Embassy and permission was obtained for  them to leave on the Embassy train.    During the day British subjects, without distinction as to age  or sex, were seized, wherever found, and sent to the fortress  of Spandau. I remonstrated with von Jagow and told him that that  was a measure taken only in the Middle Ages, and I believe that  he remonstrated with the authorities and arranged for a cessation  of the arbitrary arrests of women.    Frederick W. Wile, the well-known American correspondent of the  _London Daily Mail_, was to go out also with the British  party, on the ground that he had been a correspondent of a British  newspaper. In the evening I went to the Foreign Office to get his  passport, and, while one of the department chiefs was signing  the passport, he stopped in the middle of his signature, threw  down the pen on the table, and said he absolutely refused to  sign a passport for Wile because he hated him so and because  he believed he had been largely instrumental in the bringing  about of the war. Of course this latter statement was quite  ridiculous, but it took me some time before I could persuade  this German official to calm his hate and complete his signature.    I have heard a few people say that Wile was unduly fearful of  what the Germans might do to him, but the foregoing incident  shows that his fears were well grounded, and knowing of this  incident, which I did not tell him, I was very glad to have him  accept the hospitality of the Embassy for the night preceding  his departure. He was perfectly cool, although naturally much  pleased when I informed him that his departure had been arranged.    Sir Edward and his staff and the British correspondents left next  morning early, about six A. M. No untoward incidents occurred  at the time of their departure which was, of course, unknown to  the populace of Berlin.    During these first days there was a great spy excitement in Germany.  People were seized by the crowds in the streets and, in some  instances, on the theory that they were French or Russian spies,  were shot. Foreigners were in a very dangerous situation throughout  Germany, and many Americans were subjected to arrest and indignities.    A curious rumour spread all over Germany to the effect that  automobiles loaded with French gold were being rushed across the  country to Russia. Peasants and gamekeepers and others turned  out on the roads with guns, and travelling by automobile became  exceedingly dangerous. A German Countess was shot, an officer  wounded and the Duchess of Ratibor was shot in the arm. It was  sometime before this excitement was allayed, and many notices  were published in the newspapers before this mania was driven  from the popular brain.    There were rumours also that Russians had poisoned the Muggelsee,  the lake from whence Berlin draws part of its water supply. There  were constant rumours of the arrest of Russian spies disguised as  women throughout Germany.    Many Americans were detained under a sort of arrest in their  hotels; among these were Archer Huntington and his wife; Charles  H. Sherrill, formerly our minister to the Argentine and many  others.          CHAPTER IX    THE AMERICANS AT THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES    Of course, as soon as there was a prospect of war, the Embassy  was overrun with Americans. Few Americans had taken the precaution  of travelling with passports, and passports had become a necessity.  All of the Embassy force and all the volunteers that I could  prevail upon to serve, even a child of eleven years old, who  was stopping in the house with us, were taking applications of  the Americans who literally in thousands crowded the Wilhelm  Platz in front of the Embassy.    The question of money became acute. Travellers who had letters  of credit and bank checks for large sums could not get a cent  of money in Germany. The American Express Company, I believe,  paid all holders of its checks. When, with Mr. Wolf, President  of the American Association of Commerce and Trade in Berlin, I  called upon the director of the Imperial Bank and begged him  to arrange something for the relief of American travellers in  Germany, he refused to do anything; and I then suggested to him  that he might give paper money, which they were then printing  in Germany, to the Americans for good American credits such as  letters of credit and bank checks, and that they would then have a  credit in America which might become very valuable in the future.  He, however, refused to see this. Director Herbert Gutmann of  the Dresdener Bank was the far-seeing banker who relieved the  situation. Gutmann arranged with me that the Dresdener Bank,  the second largest bank in Germany, would cash the bank checks,  letters of credit and the American Express Company's drafts and  international business checks, etc., of Americans for reasonable  amounts, provided the Embassy seal was put on the letter of credit  or check to show that the holder was an American, and, outside  of Berlin, the seal of the American Consulate. This immediately  relieved the situation.    With the exception of Mr. Wolf who was, however, quite busy with  his own affairs, I had no American Committees such as were organised  in London and Paris to help me in Berlin. In Munich, however, the  Americans there organised themselves into an efficient committee.  Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Pulitzer were in Berlin and immediately went  to work in our Embassy. Mr. Pulitzer busied himself at giving  out passports and Mrs. Pulitzer proved herself a very efficient  worker. She and Mrs. Ruddock, wife of our Third Secretary, and  Mrs. Gherhardi, wife of the Naval Attaché, with Mrs. Gerard formed  a sort of relief committee to look after the Americans who were  without help or resources.    I arranged, with the very efficient help of Lanier Winslow, for  special trains to carry the Americans in Germany to Holland.  Trains were run from Switzerland, Munich and Carlsbad across  Germany to Holland, and from Berlin were run a number of trains  to Holland.    The first room on entering the Embassy was the ticket-office,  and there, first Mr. Winslow, and afterwards Captain Fenton,  sold tickets, giving tickets free to those who were certified  to be without funds by the committee of Mrs. Pulitzer and Mrs.  Gerard. This committee worked on the second floor of the Embassy  in the ballroom, part of it being roped off to keep the crowds  back from the ladies.    Each week I bought a number of steerage passages from the Holland  American Line and the ladies resold them in the ballroom. We had  to do this because the Holland American Line had no licence to sell  steerage tickets in Germany; but by buying two or three hundred  at a time direct from the Company, I was enabled to peddle them  out in our ballroom to those Americans who, in their eagerness to  reach their own country, were willing to endure the discomforts  of travel in the steerage.    Winslow accompanied one special train to Holland, and I must  say that I sympathised with him when I learned of what he had  to do in the way of chasing lost hand-baggage and finding milk  for crying babies.    These special trains were started from the Charlottenburg station,  in a quiet part of Berlin so that no crowd was attracted by the  departure of the Americans. The Carlsbad train went through very  successfully, taking the Americans who had been shut up in Carlsbad  since the commencement of the war.    One of the curious developments of this time was a meeting of  sympathy for the Americans stranded in Germany, held in the town  hall of Berlin on the eleventh of August. This meeting was commenced  in one of the meeting rooms of the town hall, but so many people  attended that we were compelled to adjourn to the great hall.  There speeches were made by the over-Burgomaster, von Gwinner,  Professor von Harnack and me. Another professor, who spoke excellent  English, with an English accent, made a bitter attack upon Great  Britain. In the pamphlet in which the speeches of Harnack and  the over-Burgomaster were published this professor's speech was  left out. In his speech stating the object of the meeting, the  over-Burgomaster said: \"Since we hear that a large number of  American citizens in the German Empire, and, especially, in Berlin,  find themselves in embarrassments due to the shutting off of  means of return to their own country, we here solemnly declare  it to be our duty to care for them as brethren to the limit of  our ability, and we appeal to all citizens of Berlin and the  whole of the German Empire to co-operate with us to this end.\"    Professor von Harnack, head of the Royal Library in Berlin, is  one of the ablest of the German professors. In his speech he gave  expression to the feeling that was prevalent in the first days  of the war that Germany was defending itself against a Russian  invasion which threatened to blot out the German _Kultur_. He  said, after referring to Western civilisation: \"But in the face  of this civilisation, there arises now before my eyes another  civilisation, the civilisation of the tribe, with its patriarchal  organisation, the civilisation of the horde that is gathered and  kept together by despots,--the Mongolian Muscovite civilisation.  This civilisation could not endure the light of the eighteenth  century, still less the light of the nineteenth century, and  now in the twentieth century it breaks loose and threatens us.  This unorganised Asiatic mass, like the desert with its sands,  wants to gather up our fields of grain.\"    Nothing was done for the Americans stranded in Germany by the  Germans with the exception of the arrangements for the"]]]
