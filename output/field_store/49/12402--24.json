[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#19)"],[1,"you deceive me, so tortured by      love's fever as I am?    O Krishna, like the look of you, your body which appears so black,      that heart of yours a blackness shall assume.    Follow her, you lotus-eyed, she who can dispel your trouble, go to her.    Faced with these reproaches, Krishna slinks away. Radha's friend knows,  however, that despite her bitter anger, Radha desires nothing more than  his love. She attempts, therefore, to instil in her a calmer frame of  mind, urging her to end her pride and take Krishna back. She goes to look  for Krishna and while she is absent, Krishna returns. Standing before  Radha, he implores her once again to end her anger.      If you speak but a little the moon-like gleam of your teeth will destroy      the darkness frightful, so very terrible, come over me;    Your moon of a face which glitters upon my eye, the moon-bird's eye,      now makes me long for the sweet of your lips.    O loved one, O beautiful, give up that baseless pride against me,    My heart is burnt by the fire of longing; give me that drink so sweet      of your lotus face.    O you with beautiful teeth, if you are in anger against me, strike me      then with your finger nails, sharp and like arrows,    Bind me, entwining, with the cords of your arms, and bite me then      with your teeth, and feel happy punishing.    O loved one, O beautiful, give up that baseless pride against me.    At these words, Radha's anger leaves her; and when Krishna withdraws, it  is to go to the forest and await her coming. Radha's joy returns. She  decks herself in the loveliest of her ornaments and then, accompanied by  her maids, moves slowly to the tryst.[58] As they reach the bower which  Krishna has constructed, her friend urges her to enter.      O you who bear on your face the smile that comes of the ardour of      passion    Sport with him whose love-abode is the floor of the beautiful bower.    Radha approaches and their love strains to its height.      She looked at Krishna who desired only her, on him who for long      wanted dalliance,    Whose face with his pleasure was overwhelmed and who was possessed      with desire    After embracing her long and ardently, Krishna with his necklace of      pearls    Krishna like the Jumna in a mighty flood with its necklace of specks of      foam.[59]    The cowgirls go and Krishna speaks to Radha.      O woman with desire, place on this patch of flower-strewn floor your      lotus foot,    And let your foot through beauty win,    To me who am the Lord of All, O be attached, now always yours.    O follow me, my little Radha.      O lovely woman, give me now the nectar of your lips, infuse new life      into this slave of yours, so dead,    This slave, whose heart is placed in you, whose body burned in      separation, this slave denied the pleasure of your love.    Radha yields and as the night passes they achieve height upon height of  sexual bliss.      Their love play grown great was very delightful, the love play where      thrills were a hindrance to firm embraces,    Where their helpless closing of eyes was a hindrance to longing looks      at each other, and their secret talk to their drinking of each the      other's nectar of lips, and where the skill of their love was      hindered by boundless delight.      She loved as never before throughout the course of the conflict of love,      to win, lying over his beautiful body, to triumph over her lover;    And so through taking the active part her thighs grew lifeless, and      languid her vine-like arms, and her heart beat fast, and her eyes      grew heavy and closed.      In the morning most wondrous, the heart of her lord was smitten with      arrows of Love, arrows which went through his eyes,    Arrows which were her nailed-scratched bosom, her reddened sleep-denied      eyes, her crimson lips from a bath of kisses, her hair disarranged      with the flowers awry, and her girdle all loose and slipping.    With hair knot loosened and stray locks waving, her cheeks perspiring,      her glitter of lips impaired,    And the necklace of pearls not appearing fair because of her jar-shaped      breast being denuded,    And her belt, her glittering girdle, dimmed in beauty,    The happy one drank of the face where the lips were washed with the      juice of his mouth,    His mouth half open uttering amorous noises, vague and delirious, the      rows of teeth in the breath of an indrawn sigh delightedly chattering.    Drank of the face of that deer-eyed woman whose body lay helpless,      released of excessive delight, the thrilling delight of embraces.    When their passion is at last ended, Radha begs Krishna to help her with  her toilet.      She said to the joy of her heart,    Adorn the curl on my brow which puts the lotus to shame, my spotless      brow,    Make a beautiful spot on my forehead, a spot with the paste of the      sandal,    O giver of pride, on my tresses, untidy now on account of desire, place      flowers,    Place on my hips the girdle, the clothes and the jewels,    Cover my beautiful loins, luscious and firm, the cavern of Love to be      feared.    Make a pattern upon my breasts and a picture on my cheeks and fasten over      my loins a girdle,    Bind my masses of hair with a beautiful garland and place many bracelets      upon my hands and jewelled anklets upon my feet.    Krishna does so and with a final celebration of Krishna as God and of the  song itself--its words 'sweeter than sugar, like love's own glorious  flavour'--the poem ends.    [Footnote 51: Note 18.]    [Footnote 52: Plate 20.]    [Footnote 53: Plates 21 and 22.]    [Footnote 54: Note 19.]    [Footnote 55: Plate 23.]    [Footnote 56: Plate 24.]    [Footnote 57: Plate 25.]    [Footnote 58: Plate 26.]    [Footnote 59: Plate 27.]        (iii) Later Poetry      Jayadeva's poem quickly achieved renown in Northern and Western India and  from the early thirteenth century became a leading model for all poets who  were enthralled by Krishna as God and lover. In Western India,  Bilvamangala, a poet of Malabar, composed a whole galaxy of Krishna songs,  his poem, the _Balagopala Stuti_ (The Childhood of Krishna) earning for  him the title 'the Jayadeva of the South.' But it is during the fifteenth  and sixteenth centuries that the most important developments occurred. In  Bengal, the poets Vidyapati and Chandi Das flourished in about the year  1420, while in Western India, Mira Bai, a local princess, began a  wide-spread popular movement. Mira Bai was followed by Vallabhacharya  (born 1478) who in turn inspired four poet disciples--Krishna Das, Sur  Das, Parmanand Das and Kumbhan Das. All these were at their height in the  middle of the sixteenth century, writing Hindi poems in which Radha's  adventures with Krishna and their rapturous love-making were devotedly  described.[60]    The work of Sur Das was of special importance for in one of his  compositions he took each of the thirty-six traditional modes of Indian  music-the _Ragas_ and _Raginis_--but instead of celebrating them as  separate 'musical characters,' appended to each a love-poem about Krishna.  Sur Das was followed by Keshav Das of Orchha (fl. 1580), Govind Das (fl.  1590), Bihari Lai (fl. 1650) and Kali Das (fl. 1700)--all poets in whom  religious ecstasy was blended with a feeling for passionate romance. Of  these poets Bihari Lai is famous for the _Sat Sai_ in which he celebrated  Krishna's romance in seven hundred verses.    All this later poetry differed from the _Gita Govinda_ in one important  respect. Instead of dwelling on the temporary rupture in Radha and  Krishna's relationship, it roved freely over the many phases of their  love-making, subjecting every incident to delighted analysis. A poet  thought and felt himself into Radha's mind when as a young girl about to  become a woman she discovered for the first time the exquisite sensations  of awakening love. Or he imagined he was Krishna stumbling on Radha by  accident and being stirred to ecstasy by his first glimpse of her glowing  charms. Sometimes he even became the unseen viewer of their rapturous  exchanges, comforting Radha with sage remarks or egging her on to appease  her hungry lover. In this way many incidents not recorded of any cowgirl  in the _Bhagavata Purana_, though possibly preserved in oral tradition,  came gradually into prominence, thereby confirming Radha as Krishna's  greatest love.    The following incidents will illustrate this process. Radha would be  described as one day taking her curds and milk to a village the farther  side of the river Jumma. Krishna hears of her expedition and along with  other cowherd boys waylays Radha and her friends and claims a toll. Radha  refuses to pay but at last offers to make a token gift provided he ferries  them over. Meanwhile a cowherd boy has hidden the boat and night is coming  on. It is now too late to return so the girls have no alternative but to  stay with Krishna. They lie down by the bank but in the darkness give  Krishna not only the toll but also their souls and bodies.    In another poem, Krishna is shown pestering the cowgirls for curds. Radha  decides to stand this no longer and partly in jest dresses herself up as a  constable. When Krishna next teases the girls, she descends upon him,  catches him by the wrist and 'arrests' him as a thief.[61]    It is in the poems of Chandi Das, however, that Krishna's most daring  ruses are described. Having once gained admittance to Radha's house by  dressing himself as a cowgirl, he is shown pretending to be a  flower-seller. He strings some flowers into a bunch of garlands, dangles  them on his arm and strolls blandly down the village street. When he  reaches Radha's house, he goes boldly in and is taken by Radha into a  corner where she starts to bargain. Krishna asks her to let him first  adorn her with a garland and then she can pay him. Radha agrees and as he  slips a garland over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11938"],[0,"Folklore of the Santal Parganas (#19)"],[1,"to scold him for putting her to the pain  of waiting so long. He retorted \"It was you who made me anxious by  keeping me waiting.\" \"That was not my fault: you know how much work  a woman has to do. I had to cook the supper and put my parents to  bed and rub them to sleep. Climb down and let us be off.\" So they  climbed down from the tree and mounted the horse and rode off to  a far country. On the road the girl became very thirsty but in the  dense jungle they could find no water, at last the merchant's son  threw a stone at hazard and they heard it splash in a pool; so they  went in the direction of the sound and there they found water but it  was foul and full of worms and the girl refused to drink it. She said  that she would only drink water \"which had a father and mother.\"    So they went on their way, and after a time they came to a number  of crows holding a meeting and in the midst was an owl with its head  nodding drowsily; it was seeing dreams for them; every now and then  a crow would give it a shove and ask what it had dreamt, but the owl  only murmured that it had not finished and went off to sleep again. At  last it said \"I have seen a gander and a goose go down into a river  and swim about in it.\"    The merchant's son and his companion went on and presently came to  a river in full flood, which was quite uncrossable; on the far bank  was a cow lowing to a calf which had been left on the bank where they  were. When she saw them the girl began to sing:--          \"The cow lows for its calf      The calf bleats for its mother:      My father and mother      Are weeping for me at home.\"      When he heard her lament like this the merchant's son exclaimed    \"You women are all alike, come let us go back.\"    \"How can we go back now?\" answered the girl \"You of course can pretend  that you have been hunting; but we women lose our character if we  are hidden by a bush for a minute.\"    So as they could not cross the river by themselves, a goose and gander  carried them across on their backs. As they went on the merchant's  son asked the girl how far she would like to go, a six days' journey  or a six months' journey. He told her that in the six months' journey  they would only have fruits and roots and such like to eat and water  to drink, but the six days' journey was easy and free from hardship.    The girl chose the six days' journey, so they went on for six days  and came to a stream on the banks of which stood a cottage in which  lived an old woman. Before they went up to it the girl told her lover  not to eat any rice given to him by the old woman but to throw it  to the fowls; then they went and asked to be allowed to cook their  food there; now the old woman had seven unmarried sons, who were away  hunting at the time, and when she saw the Raja's daughter she wished  to detain her and marry her to one of her sons. So in order to delay  them she gave them a damp stove and green firewood to cook with;  she also offered the merchant's son some poisoned rice but he threw  it to the fowls, and when they ate it they fell down dead.    The girl could not make the fire burn with the green wood, so  they hurried away as fast as they could without waiting to cook any  food. Before they started however the old woman managed to tie up some  mustard seed in a cloth and fasten it to their horse's tail, so that  as they rode, the seed was spilt along the road they took. When the  old woman's sons came back from hunting she greeted them by saying:  \"Why did you not come back sooner? I have just found a pretty wife  for you; but I have tied mustard seed to their horse's tail and it is  being scattered along the road: in one place it is sprouting in another  it is flowering; in another it is seeding and in another it is ripe;  when you get to the place where it is ripe you will catch them.\" So  the seven brothers pursued the two lovers and caught them up, but  the merchant's son cut down six of them with his sword; the seventh  however hid under the horse's belly and begged for mercy and offered to  serve them as groom to their horse. This man's name was Damagurguria;  they spared his life and he followed them running behind the horse;  but he watched his opportunity and caught the merchant's son unawares  and killed him with his sword.    Then he told the girl that she belonged to him and she admitted it and  asked that she might ride behind him on the horse, so Damagurguria  mounted and took her up behind him and turned homewards. He could  not see what the girl was doing and they had not gone far when she  drew his sword and killed him with it.    Then she rode back to where the body of her lover lay and began to weep  over it. As she sat there a man in shining white clothing appeared and  asked what was the matter; she told him Damagurguria had killed her  lover. Then he bade her stop crying and go and wet a _gamcha_ he gave  her and come straight back with it without looking behind her and then  pick a _meral_ twig and beat the corpse with it. So the girl took the  _gamcha_ and went and dipped it in a pool but, as she was bringing it  back, she heard a loud roaring behind her and she looked back to see  what it was; so the stranger sent her back again to the pool and this  time she did not look round though she heard the same roaring. Then  the stranger told her to join the severed head to the body and cover  it with the wet _gamcha_; and then, after waiting a little, to beat  the body with the _meral_ twig. So saying he disappeared. The girl  carefully complied with these instructions and to her joy saw the  merchant's son sit up and rub his eyes, remarking that he must have  been asleep for a long time. Great was his astonishment when he heard  how Damagurguria had killed him and how he had been restored to life  by the help of the stranger in white. This was the end of the lovers'  troubles and they lived happily ever after.            XXVII. The Flycatcher's Egg.    One day a herd boy found a flycatcher's egg and he brought it home  and asked his mother to cook it for him, but she put it on a shelf  and forgot about it. His mother was a poor woman and had to go out all  day to work; so before she started she used always to cook her son's  dinner and leave it covered up all ready for him. No sooner had she  gone to work than a _bonga_ girl used to come out of the flycatcher's  egg and first eat up the rice that had been left for the herd boy  and then quickly put water on to boil and cook some rice with pulse;  and, having eaten part of it, cover up the rest, ready for the herd  boy on his return. Then she used to comb and dress her hair and go  back into the egg. This happened every day and at last the boy asked  his mother why she gave him rice cooked with pulse every day, as he  was tired of it. His mother was much astonished and said that some  one must have been changing his food, because she always cooked his  rice with vegetables. At this the boy resolved to watch and see who  was touching his food; so one day he climbed up on to the rafters  and lay in wait. Presently out of the egg came the _bonga_ girl and  cooked the food and combed her hair as usual. Just as she was going  back into the egg, the herd boy sprang down and caught her. \"Fi, Fi,\"  cried she \"is it a _Dome_ or a _Hadi_ who is clasping me?\" \"No _Dome_  or _Hadi_,\" said he: \"we are husband and wife:\" so he took her to  wife and they lived happily together.    He strictly forbade her ever to go outside the house and he said  incantations over some mustard seed and gave it to her, and told  her that, if any beggars came, she was to give them alms through the  window and, if they refused to take them in that way, then she was  to throw the mustard seed at them; but on no account to go outside  the house. One day when her husband was away a jugi came begging;  the _bonga_ girl offered him alms through the window but the jugi  flatly refused to take them; he insisted on her coming out of the  house and giving them. Then she threw the mustard seed at him and he  turned into ashes. By superior magic however he at once recovered his  own form and again insisted on her coming outside to give him alms,  so she went out to him and he saw how beautiful she was.    The jugi went away and one day he went to beg at the Raja's palace and,  talking to the Raja, he told him how he had seen a girl of more than  human beauty. The Raja resolved to possess her, and one day he took  the form of a fly and flew to the house and saw the beautiful _bonga_;  a second day he came back in the same form and suddenly caught her  up and flew off with her on his back to his palace, and in spite of  her weeping shut her up in a beautifully furnished room on the roof  of his palace. There she had to stay and her food was brought to her  there. When the herd boy came home and found that his beautiful wife  was missing he filled the air with lamentations and leaving his home  he put on the garb of a jugi and went about begging. One day he came  to the palace of the Raja who had carried off his wife; as he begged  he heard his wife's voice, so he sang:--          \"Give me, oh give me, my flycatcher wife,      Give me my many-coloured wife.\"      Then they offered him a jar full of money to pacify him, but he threw  the rupees away one by one and continued his lament. Then the Raja  called for his two dogs Rauta and Paika and set them on the man and  they tore him to death. At this his wife wept grievously and begged  them to let her out since there was no one to carry her away, now  that her husband was dead.    They prepared to take away the corpse to burn it and the _bonga_  girl asked to be allowed to go with them as she had never seen the  funeral rites of a jugi: so they let her go.    Before starting she tied a little salt in the corner of her cloth. When  she reached the burning place, she sang to the two dogs:--          \"Build the pyre, Rauta and Paika!      "]]]
