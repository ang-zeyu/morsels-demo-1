Their prancing around made it more difficult for us  to convince the Japanese that we were hungry and thirsty.    Received two-thirds cup of rice and one teaspoon of dried fish. No  water! A bitter cold night! Much coughing! Some prisoners were acting  crazy; doing weird and unpredictable things. An officer was assigned  to guard the stairway so none of these crazy    persons would try to escape and cause an incident.    Jan. 3rd, 1945: 0800-There was an air-raid alarm! It was followed by  rapid firing from the deck for about two hours; much running about on  the deck above. Several planes flew low over the harbor probably  observing. No food; no water!    When I tried to stand, I blacked out! Many prisoners were coughing,  and suffering from cramps and dysentery. It was a very cold night. The  Japs worked all night loading the ship.    Jan. 5: In the evening, as we were trying to get to sleep, several of  us were showered with 11 liquid, which tasted like battery acid. \"What  were the Japs up to now?\" The liquid proved to be the contents of a  latrine bucket; the prisoner, carrying the bucket to the deck, was so  weak, he spilled it. When we asked the guards for some sea water to  clean ourselves off, they just laughed.       I volunteered to take guard duty at the stairway so I wouldn't  freeze to death.    Jan. 6th: It was bitter cold! We were still barefooted and wearing the  summer clothing received at the Olongapo Naval Base in the  Philippines. The guards were shivering in spite of heavy overcoats. No  food; no water!    We were taken up on deck, then down a long ladder to scows and moved  out into the harbor. Some prisoners were grabbing dirty and rotten  vegetables floating in the filthy water. Some even filled their  canteens with sea water.    In a few minutes, our scow pulled up to transport No.2, the Brazil  Maru. We were soon up the ladder and put in the second hold with the  other prisoners - all 1,273 of us. We were told that there had been  thirty deaths on the Brazil Maru. We were divided into groups of  twenty. Again it was very crowded; much confusion, much cursing.    Half cup of rice; a quarter cup of thin cabbage soup. A miserable  night.    Jan. 7, 1945: We started a hospital on the upper deck and moved some  fifty dysentery cases into it. The Japs gave us some dysentery  medicine-looked like pellets of gunpowder. Flies were very bad. Four  died! Tenko (?) 1,262.    Jan. 8th: Hatch covers were moved above us admitting dazzling light  and extreme cold. All prisoners were moved off from the lower deck;  about 473 into the forward hold, and about 789 on to the upper deck of  our hold; again it was very crowded.    Thirty-seven English and Dutch prisoners were taken off the ship-to be  transferred to a P.O.W. camp in Formosa.    Winches lowered many sacks of sugar into the lower hold. Mr. Wata  warned us, \"If you touch any sugal, you vill be hollibly shot!\"    Jan. 9th, 1945: At daybreak, we heard many planes followed by  anti-aircraft fire in the distance. Very soon, planes were overhead!  There was panic in our hold. Men were trying to get off the wooden  planks on to the steel decks. A young captain stood up and shouted,  \"Everybody stay put! You are as safe in one place as another!\"    A direct hit produced a blinding and deafening explosion nearby; a  tremendous orange flash followed by pandemonium.    Hatch covers above came crashing down into the bilge, dropping many  prisoners thirty to forty feet below. There were screams, cries,  groans, and oaths! The air was filled with dust and dirt. Wounded were  soon being dragged into our improvised hospital; many with fractures,  shrapnel wounds, all covered with dirt.    Just as we were getting the wounded cases moved into the hospital and  the dysentery cases out, back came the planes. When it was over we had  lost several of our doctors. Col. Riney Craig, Major Mack Williams and  I were the only doctors still active. We removed the clothing from  thirty dead to give to those still living. No food! No water! Open  hatches aggravated the bitter cold night.    Jan. 10, 1945: We worked on the wounded all morning. In the afternoon  my attention was called to a shrapnel-made gash in the forward  bulkhead of our hold. I looked through into the forward hold and  witnessed the most horrible sight of my life.    There were three hundred mangled Americans piled some three deep the  result of a direct bomb hit. At the sides of the hold, a few wounded  were sitting and standing dazed and motionless. The Japs had no  compassion at all they would not let us enter the forward hold to help  in any way.    Jan. 11, 1945: Finally, two days after the bombing, several masked and  white robed Jap soldiers gallantly descended the ladders into our  hold, and painted mercurochrome on minor wounds. They would not look  at the serious wounds.    The Japs wound not enter the forward hold. Only God knew what  suffering was going on there. Jap laborers pounded wooden    [image018.jpg]    wedges into the holes in the sides of the ship. Water in the forward  hole was up to the flooring.       The night was bitter cold; my feet had lost all feeling. There were  endless groans and screams from the wounded and crazed.    Jan. 12, 1945: Forty-five bodies in our hold were tied to lines to be  lifted to the deck. I can never forget the grotesque positions some of  the bodies assumed as they were raised. Then the winches lifted 150  bodies out of the forward hold and placed them on a scow beside the  ship.       One cup of rice! No water! Not even rice for the survivors in the  forward hold.    Jan. 13, 1945: 150 more bodies winched out of the forward hold. We  heard that the dead were taken to a Chinese cemetery near the beach  and cremated.    In the afternoon, our sick and wounded were raised on ropes. The rest  of us climbed the long ladders and sat on the deck waiting our turn to  get on a small platform to be lifted; twenty at a time; then dropped  at a dizzy speed to a small scow.    There were many dead on the scow; among them, my old guerrilla  chieftain, Col. Everett Warner, of Pikesville, Md., who had died just  as he predicted, \"Like a rat in a hole!\" It made me ill to look at my  good friend his face was covered with large blood blisters but I  wanted that one last look. I had always had much respect for this  dedicated soldier, a Freedom Fighter!    Enoura Maru: We were quickly taken over to the ship we had been on  earlier No. 1, the Enoura Maru and were soon pulling each other up the  long ladder. We were all placed in the same hold just aft the  superstructure.    Ed Nagel, John Shock, Cary Smith, and Wade Cothran were crowded into a  very dirty bay with me; it was filled with coal dust. We huddled next  to the coal containers to preserve any warmth in our bodies.  One-quarter cup of rice; no water!    Thirty bodies were quickly piled up by the stairs after being stripped  of their clothing to be used by the living. The count, (?) 924.    Jan. 14, 1945: Sunday - At dawn, we moved out of the harbor in a  convoy of six or seven ships. Everyone had dysentery. The latrines  were two boxes hung over the side of the ship. Only two persons were  allowed on the deck at a time. Many were too weak to climb the stairs.  The floor soon became filthy, making walking in bare feet very  unpleasant.    Our ship zigzagged generally north at a speed of about eight knots.  One-quarter cup of rice; no water! Another thirty prisoners died.  Toward evening, medics carried the bodies to the deck; after a short  service by the strongest chaplain, the bodies were slid into the sea.  The count, (?) 894.    Jan. 15, 1945: The night had been extremely cold; I had lost all  feeling in my feet. I had no desire to freeze to death; in fact I had  volunteered for the Philippines because I enjoyed warm weather. We  were all becoming extremely dehydrated; urination became very painful.  One cup of rice; no water (4th day). The count, (?) 864.    Jan. 16, 1945: Several inches of snow on the deck. Some men were  .going down into the hold to get sugar. It was very difficult to  swallow the sugar without water.    Cursing and stealing were now a way of life. Anchored all night. The  count, (?) 834.    Jan. 17, 1945: I was bitter cold; we were hibernating-huddled close  together-not moving any more than necessary; we were saving our  energy. One-quarter cup of rice; no water (6th day): Usual deaths. The  count, (?) 804.    We were very discouraged; we believed the end could not be far away.  Anchored all night!    Jan. 18, 1945: Very cold! The sea has turned muddy (? Yellow Sea). We  were passing many barren, mountainous islands to the starboard with an  occasional lighthouse. One-quarter cup of rice; twelve teaspoons of  water. Anchored at night. Thirty-two died. The count, (?) 772.    Jan. 19, 1945: We were underway at dawn-for three hours then stopped!  We were alongside a large transport badly humped up amidships. It had  been torpedoed! Many Jap soldiers were standing on the deck in their  overcoats, shivering.    We spent most of the day waiting while seamen attempted to get a cable  aboard the stricken vessel. Finally underway making only three knots.  One-half cup of rice; twelve spoons of water. Many have died. The  count, (?) 740. Anchored at night. Very cold! Brrrr!       Jan. 20, 1945: Moving north all day very slowly. Major Kirchner, an  Army medic, died in the next bay (he had had a leg broken during the  bombing of January 9th). Thirty died. The count, (?) 710.    January 21, 1945: Sea has turned green. Zigzagged generally    north. The cable to the crippled vessel snapped; we drifted for hours  while seamen spliced it. One cup of rice; several spoons of water.  Usual dead. The count, (?) 680.    Jan. 22, 1945: Monday - Moved north"]]]
