Hence the system  now recommended is expressly one for _infants_, adapted to them just  as they are, and wholly designed to repress what is evil, and to  cherish what is good.    Accordingly, the utmost attention is given to the cheerfulness  and happiness of those on whom it acts. Instruction in reading,  arithmetic, geometry, and various other things is made exceedingly  amusing; smiling countenances and sparkling eyes are observable all  around when it is communicated; and what was dull and soporific,  according to the old plan, is now insinuated so agreeably, that  the child, while literally at play, is acquiring a large amount of  valuable knowledge. At play he sees Nature's book, that world of  beauties: he loves to look into it, there is no flogging to induce  him to do it. All is enquiry and anxiety on his part. \"What is this?\"  \"What is that?\" \"What is it for?\" \"How did it come?\" With numerous  other questions of similar import. Oh, that we had teachers to teach  more out of this divine book! Oh, that we had a public who would  encourage and cherish them for so doing! What blessed results even  have I seen, by one's being able to answer such enquiries! The absurd  notion that children can only be taught in a room, must be exploded.  I have done more in one hour in the garden, in the lanes, and in the  fields, to cherish and satisfy the budding faculties of childhood,  than could have been done in a room for months. Oh, mankind have yet  something to learn about teaching children! See how they catch at  truths through the medium of living things! See how it germinates in  them, by so doing; the teacher may forget, they do not, this I have  proved hundreds of times. Music has proved a most important auxiliary  for this purpose, and a stranger would be astonished at the hilarity  and delight with which much is rehearsed, with a full perception  of its meaning, when in any other way it would be irksome and  unintelligible.    These attainments, moreover, are accompanied by various movements  and evolutions which exercise the limbs, the joints, the muscles; in  addition to which, set times are appointed every morning and afternoon  for its exclusive enjoyment.    The conduct of inferior animals, when young, shows the propriety of  giving exercise to children. Every other creature makes use of its  organs of motion as soon as possible, and many of them, when under no  necessity of moving in quest of food, cannot be restrained without  force. Such is the case with the calf, the lamb, and many more. If  these creatures were not permitted to frisk about at pleasure, they  would soon die, or become diseased. The same inclination appears very  early in the human species; but as they are not able to take exercise  themselves, it is the business of their parents and nurses to give it  them. This may be done in various ways, and the methods included  in the system are shewn in other parts of this work. It is to be  regretted that men should be so inattentive to this matter; their  negligence is one reason why females know so little of it. Women will  always be desirous to excel in such accomplishments as recommend  them to the other sex; but men generally avoid even the slightest  acquaintance with the affairs of the nursery, and many would reckon  it an affront were they supposed to know any thing of them. Not so,  however, with the kennel or the stables; a gentleman of the first  rank, who is not ashamed to give directions concerning the management  of his dogs or horses, would blush were he surprised in performing the  same office for that being who is to be the heir of his fortunes, and,  perhaps, the future hope of his country.    Arguments to show the importance of exercise, might be drawn from  every part of the animal economy. Without it, the circulation of the  blood cannot be properly carried on, nor the different secretions duly  performed; neither can the fluids be properly prepared, nor the solids  rendered firm or strong. The action of the heart, the motion of the  lungs, and all the vital functions, are greatly assisted by exercise.  But to point out the manner in which these effects are produced, would  lead us beyond the present subject. We shall, therefore, only add,  that when exercise is neglected, none of the animal functions can be  duly performed; and when this is the case, the whole constitution must  go to wreck. Healthy parents, wholesome food, and suitable clothing  will avail little where it is disregarded. Sufficient exercise will  supply many defects in nursing, but nothing can compensate for its  want. A good constitution ought certainly to be our first object in  the management of children. It lays a foundation for their being  useful and happy in life; and whoever neglects it, not only fails in  his duty to his offspring, but to society.    While this is forgotten, let us not complain of weak and thoughtless  children, or of weak and thoughtless servants; for the former are so  from the neglect of their parents and the public; and the latter from  not having been taught to think at all--and yet the very persons that  object to the education of the poor are the first to complain of their  servants.    A notion that habits of industry must be established, has, however,  been the means, I regret to state, of a sad perversion of the system  in these respects. The time allowed for amusement and exercise has  been in some cases, very much abridged that the children might learn  and practise sewing, knitting, plaiting, &c. Now, no one can be more  disposed to the encouragement of industrious habits than myself, but I  would say not at the expense of health; which I am certain, in these  cases it must be. Deprive the children of their amusement, and they  will soon cease to be the lively, happy beings, we have hitherto seen  them, and will become the sickly, inanimate creatures, we have been  accustomed to behold and pity, under the confinement and restraint  of the dame's schools. I do not scruple to affirm, that if the  _play-grounds_ of infant schools are cut off from the system,--they  will from that moment cease to be a blessing to the country.    Nothing has given me greater pain than to witness the thorough neglect  of play-ground attendance on the part of teachers and the public;  the former leave the children to themselves at the very time their  attendance is most desirable; and when, if duly watched, the children  will give them _lessons_. Yes! such lessons as no book can give, and  such lessons as every efficient teacher _must_ learn, or efficiency  is out of the question. The public are too fond of hearing tasks and  memory work, and such book-learning as is taught in school, with the  singing, and the amusing indoor work, to the detriment and neglect  of the moral and physical outdoor work. Again and again, I say, the  outdoor training tells most upon the morals and the formation of  character.    The first faculties which develop themselves in childhood, are those  of observation. The infant, who is two months old, will notice a  lighted candle; immediately that sense is gratified, it seeks to  please another, that of _touch_, and every mother knows, if not  prevented, it will put its hand in the flame. The next effort is to  examine other objects: these it will seize if it can, and after having  examined one, it will put it aside to observe another. On its being  able to move about, it seeks objects within its reach, and wishing to  gratify the sense of taste, applies every thing to the mouth; by this  it distinguishes the bitter from the sweet, and on seeing what is  sweet a second time, will point to it and wish to obtain it, whilst  what is bitter will not be desired.    The _mental_ part of the system should now be adverted to. Hence it  has been well remarked, \"From the time that children begin to use  their hands, nature directs them to handle every thing over and  over, to look at it while they handle it, and to put it into various  positions, and at various distances from the eye. We are apt to excuse  this as a childish diversion, because they must be doing something,  and have not reason to entertain themselves in a more manly way. But  if we think more justly, we shall find that they are engaged in the  most serious and important study; and if they had all the reason of a  philosopher, they could not be more properly employed. For it is this  childish employment that enables them to make the proper use of their  eyes. They are thereby every day acquiring habits of perception,  which are of greater importance than any thing we can teach them. The  original perceptions which nature gave them are few, and insufficient  for the purposes of life; and, therefore, she made them capable of  many more perceptions by habit. And to complete her work, she has  given them an unwearied assiduity in applying to the exercise by which  those perceptions are acquired.\"    Such is the education which nature gives her children, and we may add  that another part of her discipline is, that by the course of things,  children must exert all their muscular force, and employ all their  ingenuity, in order to gratify their curiosity and satisfy their  little appetites. What they desire is only to be obtained at the cost  of labour, patience, and many disappointments. By the exercise of the  body and mind necessary for satisfying their desires, they acquire  agility, strength, and dexterity in their motions, as well as  constitutional health and vigour; they learn to bear pain without  dejection, and disappointment without despondency. The education of  nature is most perfect in savages, who have no other tutor; and we see  that in the quickness of all their senses, in the agility of their  motions, in the hardiness of their constitutions, and in their ability  to bear hunger, thirst, pain, and disappointment, they commonly far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11028"],[0,"Philippine Folk-Tales (#19)"],[1,"  The next day she went to work and on this day she found a silver  peso. As she reached the edge of the field a voice spoke to her saying,  \"Tell no one of your good fortune, not even your husband, and you shall  have more treasure.\" Afterwards she went to the field, and daily she  found a peso until she had five pesos, which she hid in a safe place.    On the seventh day she went to the field, but found nothing. She went  to the edge of the field to boil her rice, and was blowing her fire  when she heard the same voice again saying, \"Never mind boiling your  rice, but dig there under your pallok, [22] and you will find more  than enough. Tell no one, not even your husband, of what you find.\" She  dug down and there she found a great jar filled to the brim with gold  pieces. She took one or two, and hastily covered up the rest and went  home. Like a good wife she disliked to keep a secret from her husband,  and finally she took him off to a quiet place and told him of their  good fortune.    He, overjoyed, could not restrain himself and went into the village  and told every one of the treasure trove. Then they went to dig it up,  but it was no longer there. Even the gold and the five pesos already  saved and hid in another secret place were gone, and they were as  poor as they had been before.    How foolish they were to disobey the command of the voice!      CHAPTER 23    The Battle of the Enchanters. [23]    There was once a poor boy who was very ambitious to learn, and with  the consent of his parents he bound himself to an enchanter who was  a very wise man. The boy remained with him for a very long time,  until at last his master sent him home, saying that he could teach  him nothing more. The boy went home, but there he found nothing in  the way of adventure, so he proposed to his father that he should  become a horse, which his father could sell for twenty pesos to his  late teacher. He cautioned his father that, as soon as he received  the money for the horse, he should drop the halter as if by accident.    The young man then became a horse, and his father took him to the  enchanter, who gave him twenty pesos. As soon as the money was in the  father's hand, he dropped the halter, and the horse at once became  a bird which flew away. The enchanter metamorphosed himself into a  hawk and followed. The bird was so hard pressed by the hawk that it  dived into the sea and became a fish. The hawk followed and became a  shark. The fish, being in danger from the shark, leaped out on to the  dry ground and took the shape of a crab, which hid in a spring where  a princess was bathing. The shark followed in the shape of a cat,  which began to search under the stones for the crab, but the crab  escaped by changing itself into a ring on the finger of the princess.    Now it chanced that the father of the princess was very sick, and  the enchanter went to the palace and offered to cure him for the  ring on the finger of the princess. To this the king agreed, but the  ring begged the princess not to give him directly to the enchanter,  but to let him fall on the floor. The princess did this, and as the  ring touched the floor it broke into a shower of rice. The enchanter  immediately took the form of a cock and industriously pecked at the  grains on the floor. But as he pecked, one of the grains changed to  a cat which jumped on him and killed him.    The young man then resumed his own form, having proven himself a  greater man than his master.      Fletcher Gardner.    Bloomington, Ind.        PART IV    A Filipino (Tagalog) Version of Aladdin.    Once on a time a poor boy and his mother went far from their home  city to seek their fortune. They were very poor, for the husband  and father had died, leaving them little, and that little was soon  spent. The boy went into the market-place to seek for work, and a  travelling merchant, seeing his distress, spoke to him and asked  many questions. When he had inquired the name of the boy's father,  he embraced him with many kind words, and told him that he was the  father's long-lost brother, and that as he had no children of his  own the boy should be his heir and for the present live with him  as his son. He sent the boy to call his mother, and when she came  he kissed her with many words of endearment, and would have it that  she was his sister-in-law, though she told him that her husband had  no brother. He treated her well and made her many presents, so that  she was forced to believe he really was her brother-in-law.    The merchant then invited the boy to go for a visit with him, promising  that the mother should soon follow. Mother and son consented, and  the merchant set off with his nephew in the afternoon. They went  far and came to a mountain which they crossed, and then to a second,  which seemed very high to the poor boy so that he begged to rest. The  man would not allow this, and when the boy cried, beat him till he  agreed to do whatever he was told. They crossed this mountain also,  and came to a third, and on the very top they stopped. The merchant  drew a ring from his own finger and put it on that of the boy. Then  he drew a circle around the boy and told him not to be frightened at  what would happen, but to stretch out his arms three times, and that  the third time the ground would open, and that then he must descend  and get a tabo [24] that he would find, and that with that in their  hands they could quickly return. The boy, from fear of the man, did  as he was told, and when the ground opened, went down into the cave  and got the tabo. As he reached up his hand to be pulled from the  cave, the man took the ring from his finger, and told him to hand  up the vessel, but the boy, now much frightened, refused unless he  were first helped out himself. That the man would not do, and after  much talk drew another circle around the cave-mouth, bade it close,  and left the boy a prisoner in most evil plight.    Alone and helpless for three days in the underground darkness,  the boy was a prey to awful fear, but at the end of the third day,  having by accident rubbed slightly the tabo with his hand, at once  a great sinio [25] or multo [26] stood before him, saying that he  was the slave of the tabo, and that all things earthly were within  his power. At once mindful of his mother, he told the multo to take  him home, and in the winking of an eye, still carrying the tabo in  his hand, he stood before his mother. He found her very hungry and  sorrowful, and recounted all that had happened and again rubbed the  tabo lightly. The multo reappeared and the good woman hid her face  for terror at the sight, but the lad bade the multo bring him a dinner  for them both on a service of silver with everything to match.    After they had dined well for several days on the remnants of the  food, the boy went to the market and sold the spoons that the multo  had brought for two gold pieces, and on that they lived a long time:  and as from time to time their money became exhausted, he sold more,  till at last there was nothing left. Then, as he had become a young  man, he required the multo to bring him a great chest of money,  and soon became known as a very rich and generous person.    Now there was in that city a woman who had a very handsome daughter  whom she wished to marry to the young man, and by way of opening the  matter, she and her daughter went one day to try to buy some of the  rich table ware which he had, or at least so they pretended. The young  man was not of a mind for that kind of alliance, and so told the old  woman to rub the magic vessel. She did so and the multo at once whisked  her inside. The daughter also went in to inquire for her mother, and  as she admiringly touched the tabo the multo made her prisoner, and the  two became the slaves of the young man and were never heard of again.            A variant of this tale has been printed in Tagalog. It has probably  reached the Phillppines through the medium of Spanish.      Fletcher Gardner.    Bloomington, Ind.        PART V    Some Games of Filipino Children.      Os-Os.    This is a game used by older persons to amuse small children, exactly  as our game of the \"Five Little Pigs.\"    The child is grasped by the wrist with the left hand of the elder,  who repeats \"Ang ama, ang ina, ang kaka, ang ali, ang nono, toloy,  os-os sa kili-kili mo.\" That is, \"The father (thumb), the mother  (forefinger), the elder brother (middle finger), the elder sister  (ring finger), the grandparent (little finger) straight up to your  armpit.\" The armpit is then tickled. Os-os is a verb meaning \"to go  up stream.\" This is a common game among the Tagalogs of Mindoro Island.      Marbles.    The game of marbles is played with conical shells, propelled by laying  on the ground and striking with the ulnar side of the index finger,  which is snapped from the thumb against it. The goal is a hole in the  ground, in which the stakes, usually consisting of other shells of  the same kind, are deposited. The \"taw\" is a straight line some six  or eight feet away. If a shell is struck, the owner of the striking  shell has another shot, and the owner of the shell struck shoots from  where he lies. He seems to incur no penalty.    This is a common game on Mindoro, and is played usually at the  beginning of the dry season.      Tago-Tago.    Translated, the name means, \"Play at hiding.\" It is played exactly  as \"I spy\" and the counting out beforehand is similar. There is a  considerable number of counting-out rhymes to be heard, only one of  which I am able to give entire. It is in Filipino Spanish. \"Pim, pim,  serapim, agua, ronda, San Miguel, arcangel.\"    In English, \"Phim, phim, seraphim, water, the night patrol,  St. Michael, the archangel.\"      Hop-Scotch.    This game is played by marking out in the dust or sand a parallelogram,  which is subdivided into a varying number of compartments. A small  stone is put into the"]]]
