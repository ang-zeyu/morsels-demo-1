This ride along a river where we could, when we pleased, either water our  horses, or take a drink ourselves, was quite new and delightful to us,  under a temperature of 105 deg. in the shade. Our guide, aged apparently  about fifty, walked frequently into the river, while in a state of  perspiration; dipped quite under water, or drank a little with his lip on  the level of its surface, and then walked on again. He was at last very  tired, however, and pointed to the large muscles of the RECTUS FEMORIS as  if they pained him. We found at the camp, on our return, five of the  drays that had come up, the other three being still behind, and requiring  double teams of exhausted cattle to bring them forward. In the vicinity  of our camp we found the TRICHINIUM ALOPECUROIDEUM, with heads of flowers  nearly five inches long; an eucalyptus near E. PULVERULENTA, but having  more slender peduncles; a sort of Iron-bark. We found also a tall  glaucous new HALORAGIS [*], and a curious new shaggy KOCHIA was  intermingled with the grass.[**] Thermometer at sunrise, 77 deg.; at noon,  102 deg.; at 4, 107 deg.; at 9, 76 deg.;--with wet bulb, 71 deg..

MSS.); annua, stricta, glaberrima, glauca, foliis  oppositis lineari-oblongis obtusis petiolatis grosse serratis, racemis  apice aphyllis, fructu globoso tuberculato laevi.]    [** K. VILLOSA (Lindl. MSS.); ramis erectis foliisque linearibus  villosissimis, fructibus glabris.]    11TH MARCH.--All the drays came in early. I gave to the two natives, the  tomahawks, tobacco, and pipes, as promised; also a note to the stockman  on the Barwan, who had provided me with them, saying that they had been  very useful. I this morning examined the country to the westward of the  swamp, and found a narrow place at which we could pass, and so avoid much  soft heavy ground. The ramifications of the watery Narran penetrated into  the hollows of the stony ridge, presenting there little hollows full of  rich verdure and pools of water, a sight so unwonted amongst rocks  characteristic of D'Urban's arid group. In one little hollow, to the  westward of our camp, it seemed possible for two men with a pickaxe and  shovel to have continued it through, and so to have opened a new channel  for the passage of the waters of the Narran swamp, into the dry country  between it and the Barwan. Thermometer at sunrise, 55 deg.; at noon, 105 deg.; at  4 P. M., 102 deg.; at 9, 75 deg.;--with wet bulb, 59 deg..    12TH MARCH.--I found it necessary to sit still here and refresh the jaded  bullocks; thus days and months passed away, in which with horses I might  have continued the journey. The very extensive country before us, which  appeared to absorb these waters, was quite clear of timber, and irrigated  by little canals winding amongst POLYGONUM JUNCEUM. This open country  appeared to extend north-eastward about eight miles, thence to turn  eastward, as if these waters found some outlet that way to the Barwan. I  regretted that this swamp led too far out of our way, to admit of our  tracing its limits to the eastward.    This day I received letters from Commissioner Mitchell, in which he  strongly recommended to my attention the rivers Biree, Bokhara, and  Narran, as waters emanating from, and leading to, the Balonne, a river  which he said might supply our party with water, in this very dry season,  almost to the tropic. I was able to inform him in reply, that I was  already on the Narran, and that I had already availed myself of his  account of the rivers formerly sent me, on which I must have been obliged  to depend, even if the party had passed by Fort Bourke.    This evening, by moonlight, I conducted a dray, carrying two platforms,  to the place where the narrow channel, feeding the swamp, could be passed  without our meeting beyond any other impediment to the drays. The  sleepers used for this purpose were made of pine (CALLITRIS PYRAMIDALIS),  found half a mile back from our camp. They were fourteen feet long, two  feet wide, being composed of cross-pieces, two feet long, fixed at each  end between two sleepers, so that they somewhat resembled a wooden  railway. These, when laid at the proper distance apart to carry both  wheels, were bedded on the soft earth, and the interval between was  filled to a level with them, by layers of polygonum and long grass,  alternate with earth, forming together a mass of sufficient resistance to  support the feet of the draught oxen. The whole formed a compact bridge  or gangway. Thermometer at sunrise, 51 deg.; at noon, 95 deg.; at 4 P. M., 107 deg.;  at 9, 70 deg.;--with wet bulb, 61 deg..    13TH MARCH.--The party once more moved onward, and the drays trundled  across the swampy arm by means of our bridge, which, even in the event of  an accession of water there, might have proved serviceable on our return.  Three miles beyond it we had to ford the Narran, passing over a gravelly  bottom to the eastern bank, and encamping there. The drays were slow in  arriving at this ford and camp, as the ground was soft and hollow, but by  sunset all had crossed, and our camp established on the Narran.  Thermometer at sunrise, 71 deg.; at noon, 100 deg.; at 4 P. M., 100 deg.; at 9,  71 deg.;--with wet bulb, 65 deg.. The height of this camp above the sea,  according to ten registered observations, is 487 feet.    14TH MARCH.--We now had before us water and grass in abundance, to a  distance as unlimited and indefinite, as our hopes of discovery. I  intended to set out early each morning, and travel only four or five  miles, that the jaded animals, exhausted by want of water and hard work,  might have time to feed and refresh. One old cause of delay, however,  again occurred to impede us,--three bullocks were reported missing. Now  it was nearly full moon, and two men had been on watch all night. It  really seemed that delay and disappointment must attend all who depend on  bullocks and bullock-drivers. The stray cattle were not brought up until  9 A. M., when we proceeded, and encamped on an angle of the Narran, after  travelling about five miles. In the scrubs passed through, we found the  fragrant JASMINUM LINEARE in fruit, the flowers being nearly past; a bulb  which proved to be the ANTHERICUM BULBOSUM of Brown; a shrub ten feet  high, in fruit, the CANTHIUM OLEIFOLIUM of Sir William Hooker; a fine new  CHENOPODIUM, with long naked spikes of woolly yellow flowers [*]; and a  hoary variety of ACACIA LEPTOCLADA, or perhaps a distinct species, having  a good deal of the aspect of A. DEALBATA, but the leaves and glands  nearer those of A. LEPTOCLADA, according to Mr. Bentham. Thermometer at  sunrise, 70 deg.; at noon, 103 deg.; at 4 P. M., 102 deg.; at 9, 81 deg.;--with wet bulb,  75 deg..    [* C. AURICOMUM (Lindl. MSS.); totum glaucum farinosum, caule stricto,  foliis petiolatis oblongis subhastatis lobisque posticis obtusis supremis  lanceolatis, spicis compositis nudis aphyllis glomeratis multifloris  tomentosis.]    15TH MARCH.--The sand amongst the scrubs was so soft and yielding, that  the draught animals could not draw the drays through it without great  difficulty; indeed, it was only possible by double-backing, as the  drivers termed their practice of alternately assisting one another, a  process to which all had had recourse with one exception. It was not  until 1 A. M. of this morning, therefore, that the last dray was brought  to the camp. Another bullock died on the way, and thus I felt, when the  field of discovery lay open before me, that my means of conveyance were  unsuited to the task. Overloading at Boree, unskilful driving, excessive  heat, and want of water, had contributed to render the bullocks  unserviceable, and I already contemplated the organization of a lighter  party and fewer men, with which I might go forward at a better rate,  leaving the heavy articles of equipment and tired cattle in a depot, on  some good grassy spot. The latitude of this camp was 29 deg. 38' 21\" south.  Thermometer at sunrise, 73 deg.; at noon, 84 deg.; at 4 P. M., 86 deg.; at 9, 65 deg.;--  with wet bulb, 60 deg..    16TH MARCH.--I proceeded six miles, and chose a camp beside a bend of the  Narran, full of deep water, and in the midst of most luxuriant grass. The  drays arrived by 11 A. M. in such good order, that I was induced to try  whether, by early starting, good feeding, and short journeys, the party  could not be got forward to the Balonne, where I could leave the whole in  one depot, to rest and refresh, while I took my intended ride forward.  Latitude, 29 deg. 34' 11\" S. Thermometer at sunrise, 43 deg.; at noon, 86 deg.; at 4  P. M., 87 deg.; at 9, 62 deg.;--with wet bulb, 55 deg..    17TH MARCH.--I proceeded seven miles, and the drays came forward as well  as they did yesterday, so that I again entertained hopes of the progress  of the united party, which was very desirable, as these plains were  evidently sometimes so saturated with water as to be rendered wholly  impassable for wheel-carriages or even horses. Latitude, 29 deg. 29' 11\" S.  Thermometer at sunrise, 47 deg.; at noon, 87 deg.; at 4 P. M., 91 deg.; at 9, 62 deg.;--  with wet bulb, 52 deg..    18TH MARCH.--Again we made out a short journey over rather soft ground;  all the drays coming in, although slowly. I rode to a gently rising  ground, a great novelty, which appeared bearing E. N. E. from our camp,  at a distance of 21/2 miles. I found it consisted of gravel of the usual  conglomerate decomposed--of rounded fragments of about a cubic inch in  bulk. The grass was good there, and I perceived that the same gravelly  ridge extended back from the river in a north and south direction.  Graceful groups of trees grew about this stony ground, which looked, upon  the whole, better than the red sandy soil of the scrubs and callitris  forest. This seemed the dividing ridge between the Narran "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#18)"],[1,"of them credit for more sense.\"    \"It has certainly taken me very much by surprise,\" said Rose, smiling.  \"I cannot realize that Elsie is grown up enough to be beginning with  such things; yet you know she has passed her fifteenth birthday,  and that half the girls about here become engaged before they are  sixteen.\"    \"But Elsie shall not. I'll have no nonsense of the kind for years to  come. She shall not marry a day before she is twenty-one, I had nearly  said twenty-five; and I don't think I'll allow it before then.\"    Rose laughed. \"My dear, do you know what my age was when you married  me?\"    \"Twenty-one, you told me.\"    \"Don't you think my father ought then to have kept us waiting four  years longer?\"    \"No,\" he answered, stooping to stroke her hair, and snatch a kiss from  her rich red lips.    She looked up smilingly into his face. \"Ah, consistency is a jewel!  and pray how old were you when you married the first time? and what  was then the age of Elsie's mother?\"    \"Your arguments are not unanswerable, Mrs. Dinsmore. Your father could  spare you, having several other daughters; I have but one, and can't  spare her. Elsie's mother was not older when I married her, it is  true, than Elsie is now, but was much more mature, and had neither the  happy home nor the doting father her daughter has. And as for myself,  though much too young to marry, I was a year older than this Herbert  Carrington; and I was in sound and vigorous health, while he, poor  fellow, is sadly crippled, and likely always to be an invalid, and  very unlikely to live to so much as see his majority. Do you think I  ought for a moment to contemplate allowing Elsie to sacrifice herself  to him?\"    \"It would seem a terrible sacrifice; and yet after all it will depend  very much upon the state of her own feelings.\"    \"If she were five or six years older, I should say yes to that; but  girls of her age are not fit to choose a companion for life; taste  and judgment are not matured, and the man who pleases them now may be  utterly repugnant to them in after years. Is not that so?\"    \"Yes; and I think your decision is wise and kind. Still, I am sorry  for the poor boy, and hope you will deal very gently and kindly with  him.\"    \"I shall certainly try to do so. I pity him, and cannot blame him for  fancying my lovely daughter--I really don't see how he or any young  fellow can help it, but he can't have her, and of course I must tell  him so. I must see Elsie first however, and have already sent her a  note ordering her home immediately.\"    \"Come into my room for a little, dear,\" Mrs. Norris whispered to  Elsie as they rose from the dinner table. \"Herbert must not expect to  monopolize all your time.\"    It turned out that all the old lady wanted was an opportunity to  express her delight in the prospect of some day claiming Elsie as her  granddaughter, and to pet and fondle her a little. Mr. Norris did his  share of that also, and when at length they let her go she encountered  Mr. Carrington in the hall, and had to submit to some thing more of  the same sort from him.    \"We are all heartily rejoiced, little Elsie,\" he said, \"all of us who  know the secret; it is to be kept from the children, of course, till  your father's consent has made all certain. But there is Lucy looking  for you; Herbert has sent her, I daresay. No doubt he grudges every  moment that you are out of his sight.\"    That was true, and his glad look, as she took her accustomed place by  the side of his couch, was pleasant to see. But he was not selfish in  his happiness, and seemed well satisfied to share Elsie's society with  his sister.    The three were making very merry together, when a servant from the  Oaks was seen riding leisurely up the avenue. He had some small white  object in his hand which he began waving about his head the moment he  saw that he had attracted their attention.    \"It's a letter!\" exclaimed Lucy. \"Han, Scip,\" to the two little blacks  who, as usual, were tumbling over each other on the grass near by,  \"run, one of you and get it, quick now!\"    \"What--who--Miss Lucy?\" they cried, jumping up.    \"Yonder; don't you see Mr. Dinsmore's man with a letter? Run and get  it, quick!\"    \"Yes'm!\" and both scampered off in the direction of the horseman, who,  suddenly urging on his steed, was now rapidly nearing the house.    \"Hollo! dar now, you ole Jim!\" shouted Scip, making a dash at the  horse, \"who dat lettah fur? You gub um to me.\"    A contemptuous sniff was the only answer, and dashing by them, Jim  drew rein close to the veranda. \"Massa he send dis for you, Miss  Elsie,\" he said, holding out the letter to her.    She sprang forward, took it from his hand and hastily tore open the  envelope, the rich color coming and going in her cheek. A glance was  sufficient, and turning her flushed face to the anxious, expectant  Herbert: \"Papa has sent for me to return home immediately,\" she said;  \"I must go.\"    \"Oh, Elsie, must you indeed? and is there no word for me--none at  all?\"    \"Yes, he says you shall hear from him to-day or to-morrow.\"    She had gone close to him and was speaking in a low tone that the  servants might not hear. Herbert took both her hands in his. \"Oh, I am  so sorry! You were to have stayed two days longer. I fear this sudden  recall does not argue well for me. Is he angry, do you think?\"    \"I don't know, I can't tell. The note is simply an order for me to  come home at once and the message to you that I have given; nothing  more at all. Jim is to see me safely to the Oaks.\" Then turning to the  messenger, \"Go and saddle Glossy, and bring her round at once, Jim,\"  she said.    \"Yes, Miss Elsie, hab her roun' in less dan no time.\"    \"Go with Jim to the stables, Han,\" said Herbert, sighing as he spoke.    \"Elsie, I can't bear to have you leave us so suddenly,\" cried Lucy;  \"it does seem too bad of your father, after giving you permission to  stay a whole week, to go and dock off two days.\"    \"But papa has a right, and I can't complain. I've nothing to do but  obey. I'll go up and have my riding-habit put on, while Glossy is  being saddled.\"    \"Miss Elsie,\" said Jim, leisurely dismounting, \"massa say de wagon be  here in 'bout an hour for de trunk, an' Aunt Chloe mus' hab 'em ready  by dat time; herself too.\"    \"Very well, she shall do so,\" and with another whispered word to  Herbert, Elsie went into the house, Lucy going with her.    \"Why, my dear, this is very sudden, is it not?\" exclaimed Mrs.  Carrington, meeting her young guest as she came down dressed for her  ride. \"I thought you were to stay a week, and hoped you were enjoying  your visit as much as we were.\"    \"Thank you, dear Mrs. Carrington; I have had a delightful time, but  papa has sent for me.\"    \"And like a good child, you obey at once.\"    \"My father's daughter would never dare to do otherwise,\" replied  Elsie, smiling; \"though I hope I should not, if I did dare.\"    \"You'll come again soon--often, till I can get strength to go to you?\"  Herbert said entreatingly, as he held her hand in parting. \"And we'll  correspond, won't we? I should like to write and receive a note every  day when we do not meet.\"    \"I don't know; I can promise nothing till I have asked permission of  papa.\"    \"But if he allows it?\"    \"If he allows it, yes; good-bye.\"    Dearly as Elsie loved her father, she more than half dreaded the  meeting with him now; so entirely uncertain was she how he would feel  in regard to this matter.    He was on the veranda, watching for her. Lifting her from her horse,  he led her into his study. Then putting an arm about her waist, his  other hand under her chin so that her blushing, downcast face was  fully exposed to his gaze, \"What does all this mean?\" he asked. \"Look  up into my face and tell me if it is really true that you want me to  give you away? if it is possible that you love that boy better than  your father?\"    She lifted her eyes as he bade her, but dropped them again instantly;  then as he finished his sentence, \"Oh, no, no, papa! not half so well;  how could you think it?\" she cried, throwing her arms about his neck,  and hiding her face on his breast.    \"Ah, is that so?\" he said, with a low, gleeful laugh, as he held her  close to his heart. \"But he says you accepted him on condition that  papa would give consent, that you owned you cared for him.\"    \"And so I do, papa; I've always loved him as if he were my brother;  and I'm so sorry for all he suffers, that I would do anything I could  to make him happy.\"    \"Even to sacrificing yourself? It is well indeed for you that you have  a father to take care of you.\"    \"Are you going to say 'No' to him, papa?\" she asked, looking up half  beseechingly.    \"Indeed I am.\"    \"Ah, papa, he said it would kill him if you did.\"    \"I don't believe it; people don't die so easily. And I have several  reasons for my refusal, each one of which would be quite sufficient of  itself. But you just acknowledged to me that you don't love him at all  as you ought. Why, my child, when you meet the right person you will  find that your love for him is far greater than what you feel for me.\"    \"Papa, I don't think that could be possible,\" she said, clinging  closer to him than before.    \"But you'll be convinced when the time comes, though I hope that  will not be for many a long year yet. Then Herbert's ill health and  lameness are two insuperable objections. Lastly, you are both entirely  too young to be thinking of such matters.\"    \"He didn't mean to ask you to give me to him now, papa; not for a year  or two at the very least.\"    \"But I won't have you engaging yourself while you are such a mere  child. I don't approve of long engagements, or intend to let you  marry for six or seven years to come. So you may as well dismiss all  thoughts on the subject; and if any other boy or man attempts to talk  to you as Herbert has, just tell him that your father utterly forbids  you to"]]]
