These, when they had come at them, we found to be very  good and sound, and this being so, I bid them make three-yarn sennit;  meaning it for the strings of the bows. Now, it will be observed that I  have said bows, and this I will explain. It had been my original  intention to make one great bow, lashing a dozen of the reeds together  for the purpose; but this, upon pondering it, I conceived to be but a  poor plan; for there would be much life and power lost in the rendering  of each piece through the lashings, when the bow was released. To  obviate this, and further, to compass the bending of the bow, the which  had, at first, been a source of puzzlement to me as to how it was to be  accomplished, I had determined to make twelve separate bows, and these I  intended to fasten at the end of the stock one above the other, so that  they were all in one plane vertically, and because of this conception, I  should be able to bend the bows one at a time, and slip each string over  the catch-notch, and afterwards frap the twelve strings together in the  middle part so that they would be but one string to the butt of the  arrow. All this, I explained to the bo'sun, who, indeed, had been  exercised in his own mind as to how we should be able to bend such a bow  as I intended to make, and he was mightily pleased with my method of  evading this difficulty, and also one other, which, else, had been  greater than the bending, and that was the _stringing_ of the bow, which  would have proved a very awkward work.    Presently, the bo'sun called out to me that he had got the surface of the  stock sufficiently smooth and nice; and at that I went over to him; for  now I wished him to burn a slight groove down the center, running from  end to end, and this I desired to be done very exactly; for upon it  depended much of the true flight of the arrow. Then I went back to my own  work; for I had not yet finished notching the bows. Presently, when I  had made an end of this, I called for a length of the sennit, and, with  the aid of another man, contrived to string one of the bows. This, when I  had finished, I found to be very springy, and so stiff to bend that I had  all that I could manage to do so, and at this I felt very satisfied.    Presently, it occurred to me that I should do well to set some of the men  to work upon the line which the arrow was to carry; for I had determined  that this should be made also from the white hemp yarns, and, for the  sake of lightness, I conceived that one thickness of yarn would be  sufficient; but so that it might compass enough of strength, I bid them  split the yarns and lay the two halves up together, and in this manner  they made me a very light and sound line; though it must not be supposed  that it was finished at once; for I needed over half a mile of it, and  thus it was later finished than the bow itself.    Having now gotten all things in train, I set me down to work upon one of  the arrows; for I was anxious to see what sort of a fist I should make of  them, knowing how much would depend upon the balance and truth of the  missile. In the end, I made a very fair one, feathering it with its own  leaves, and truing and smoothing it with my knife; after which I inserted  a small bolt in the forrard end, to act as a head, and, as I conceived,  give it balance; though whether I was right in this latter, I am unable  to say. Yet, before I had finished my arrow, the bo'sun had made the  groove, and called me over to him, that I might admire it, the which I  did; for it was done with a wonderful neatness.    Now I have been so busy with my description of how we made the great bow,  that I have omitted to tell of the flight of time, and how we had eaten  our dinner this long while since, and how that the people in the hulk had  waved to us, and we had returned their signals, and then written upon a  length of the canvas the one word, \"WAIT.\" And, besides all this, some  had gathered our fuel for the coming night.    And so, presently, the evening came upon us; but we ceased not to work;  for the bo'sun bade the men to light a second great fire, beside our  former one, and by the light of this we worked another long spell;  though it seemed short enough, by reason of the interest of the work.  Yet, at last, the bo'sun bade us to stop and make supper, which we did,  and after that, he set the watches, and the rest of us turned in; for we  were very weary.    In spite of my previous weariness, when the man whom I relieved called me  to take my watch, I felt very fresh and wide awake, and spent a great  part of the time, as on the preceding night, in studying over my plans  for completing the great bow, and it was then that I decided finally in  what manner I would secure the bows athwart the end of the stock; for  until then I had been in some little doubt, being divided between several  methods. Now, however, I concluded to make twelve grooves across the sawn  end of the stock, and fit the middles of the bows into these, one above  the other, as I have already mentioned; and then to lash them at each  side to bolts driven into the sides of the stock. And with this idea I  was very well pleased; for it promised to make them secure, and this  without any great amount of work.    Now, though I spent much of my watch in thinking over the details of my  prodigious weapon, yet it must not be supposed that I neglected to  perform my duty as watchman; for I walked continually about the top of  the hill, keeping my cut-and-thrust ready for any sudden emergency. Yet  my time passed off quietly enough; though it is true that I witnessed one  thing which brought me a short spell of disquiet thought. It was in this  wise:--I had come to that part of the hill-top which overhung the valley,  and it came to me, abruptly, to go near to the edge and look over. Thus,  the moon being very bright, and the desolation of the valley reasonably  clear to the eye, it appeared to me, as I looked that I saw a movement  among certain of the fungi which had not burnt, but stood up shriveled  and blackened in the valley. Yet by no means could I be sure that it was  not a sudden fancy, born of the eeriness of that desolate looking vale;  the more so as I was like to be deceived because of the uncertainty which  the light of the moon gives. Yet, to prove my doubts, I went back until I  had found a piece of rock easy to throw, and this, taking a short run, I  cast into the valley, aiming at the spot where it had seemed to me that  there had been a movement. Immediately upon this, I caught a glimpse of  some moving thing, and then, more to my right, something else stirred,  and at this, I looked towards it; but could discover nothing. Then,  looking back at the clump at which I had aimed my missile, I saw that the  slime covered pool, which lay near, was all a-quiver, or so it seemed.  Yet the next instant I was just as full of doubt; for, even as I watched  it, I perceived that it was quite still. And after that, for some time, I  kept a very strict gaze into the valley; yet could nowhere discover aught  to prove my suspicions, and, at last, I ceased from watching it; for I  feared to grow fanciful, and so wandered to that part of the hill which  overlooked the weed.    Presently, when I had been relieved, I returned to sleep, and so till the  morning. Then, when we had made each of us a hasty breakfast--for all  were grown mightily keen to see the great bow completed--we set-to upon  it, each at our appointed task. Thus, the bo'sun and I made it our work  to make the twelve grooves athwart the flat end of the stock, into which  I proposed to fit and lash the bows, and this we accomplished by means of  the iron futtock-shroud, which we heated in its middle part, and then,  each taking an end (protecting our hands with canvas), we went one on  each side and applied the iron until at length we had the grooves burnt  out very nicely and accurately. This work occupied us all the morning;  for the grooves had to be deeply burnt; and in the meantime the men had  completed near enough sennit for the stringing of the bows; yet those who  were at work on the line which the arrow was to carry, had scarce made  more than half, so that I called off one man from the sennit to turn-to,  and give them a hand with the making of the line.    When dinner was ended, the bo'sun and I set-to about fitting the bows  into their places, which we did, and lashed them to twenty-four bolts,  twelve a side, driven into the timber of the stock, about twelve inches  in from the end. After this, we bent and strung the bows, taking very  great care to have each bent exactly as the one below it; for we started  at the bottom. And so, before sunset, we had that part of our work ended.    Now, because the two fires which we had lit on the previous night had  exhausted our fuel, the bo'sun deemed it prudent to cease work, and go  down all of us to bring up a fresh supply of the dry seaweed and some  bundles of the reeds. This we did, making an end of our journeyings just  as the dusk came over the island. Then, having made a second fire, as on  the preceding night, we had first our supper, and after that another  spell of work, all the men turning to upon the line which the arrow was  to carry, whilst the bo'sun and I set-to, each of us, upon the making of  a fresh arrow; for I had realized that we should have to make one or two  flights before we could hope to find our range and make true our aim.    Later, maybe about nine of the night, the bo'sun bade us all to put away  our work, and then he set the watches, after which the rest of us went  into the tent to sleep; for the strength of the wind made the shelter a  very pleasant thing.    That night, when it came my turn to watch, I minded me to take a look  into the valley; but though I watched at intervals through the half of an  hour, I saw nothing to lead me to imagine that I had indeed seen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#19)"],[1,"   \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"She definitely told me so. All he had to do was propose.\"    \"Yes sir.\"    \"Well, didn't he?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then what the dickens did he talk about?\"    \"Newts, sir.\"    \"Newts?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Newts?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"But why did he want to talk about newts?\"    \"He did not want to talk about newts, sir. As I gather from Mr.  Fink-Nottle, nothing could have been more alien to his plans.\"    I simply couldn't grasp the trend.    \"But you can't force a man to talk about newts.\"    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle was the victim of a sudden unfortunate spasm of  nervousness, sir. Upon finding himself alone with the young lady, he  admits to having lost his morale. In such circumstances, gentlemen  frequently talk at random, saying the first thing that chances to enter  their heads. This, in Mr. Fink-Nottle's case, would seem to have been the  newt, its treatment in sickness and in health.\"    The scales fell from my eyes. I understood. I had had the same sort of  thing happen to me in moments of crisis. I remember once detaining a  dentist with the drill at one of my lower bicuspids and holding him up  for nearly ten minutes with a story about a Scotchman, an Irishman, and a  Jew. Purely automatic. The more he tried to jab, the more I said \"Hoots,  mon,\" \"Begorrah,\" and \"Oy, oy\". When one loses one's nerve, one simply  babbles.    I could put myself in Gussie's place. I could envisage the scene. There  he and the Bassett were, alone together in the evening stillness. No  doubt, as I had advised, he had shot the works about sunsets and fairy  princesses, and so forth, and then had arrived at the point where he had  to say that bit about having something to say to her. At this, I take it,  she lowered her eyes and said, \"Oh, yes?\"    He then, I should imagine, said it was something very important; to which  her response would, one assumes, have been something on the lines of  \"Really?\" or \"Indeed?\" or possibly just the sharp intake of the breath.  And then their eyes met, just as mine met the dentist's, and something  suddenly seemed to catch him in the pit of the stomach and everything  went black and he heard his voice starting to drool about newts. Yes, I  could follow the psychology.    Nevertheless, I found myself blaming Gussie. On discovering that he was  stressing the newt note in this manner, he ought, of course, to have  tuned out, even if it had meant sitting there saying nothing. No matter  how much of a twitter he was in, he should have had sense enough to see  that he was throwing a spanner into the works. No girl, when she has been  led to expect that a man is about to pour forth his soul in a fervour of  passion, likes to find him suddenly shelving the whole topic in favour of  an address on aquatic Salamandridae.    \"Bad, Jeeves.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And how long did this nuisance continue?\"    \"For some not inconsiderable time, I gather, sir. According to Mr.  Fink-Nottle, he supplied Miss Bassett with very full and complete  information not only with respect to the common newt, but also the  crested and palmated varieties. He described to her how newts, during  the breeding season, live in the water, subsisting upon tadpoles, insect  larvae, and crustaceans; how, later, they make their way to the land and  eat slugs and worms; and how the newly born newt has three pairs of long,  plumlike, external gills. And he was just observing that newts differ  from salamanders in the shape of the tail, which is compressed, and that  a marked sexual dimorphism prevails in most species, when the young lady  rose and said that she thought she would go back to the house.\"    \"And then----\"    \"She went, sir.\"    I stood musing. More and more, it was beginning to be borne in upon me  what a particularly difficult chap Gussie was to help. He seemed to so  marked an extent to lack snap and finish. With infinite toil, you  manoeuvred him into a position where all he had to do was charge ahead,  and he didn't charge ahead, but went off sideways, missing the objective  completely.    \"Difficult, Jeeves.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    In happier circs., of course, I would have canvassed his views on the  matter. But after what had occurred in connection with that mess-jacket,  my lips were sealed.    \"Well, I must think it over.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Burnish the brain a bit and endeavour to find the way out.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, good night, Jeeves.\"    \"Good night, sir.\"    He shimmered off, leaving a pensive Bertram Wooster standing motionless  in the shadows. It seemed to me that it was hard to know what to do for  the best.        -12-      I don't know if it has happened to you at all, but a thing I've noticed  with myself is that, when I'm confronted by a problem which seems for the  moment to stump and baffle, a good sleep will often bring the solution in  the morning.    It was so on the present occasion.    The nibs who study these matters claim, I believe, that this has got  something to do with the subconscious mind, and very possibly they may be  right. I wouldn't have said off-hand that I had a subconscious mind, but  I suppose I must without knowing it, and no doubt it was there, sweating  away diligently at the old stand, all the while the corporeal Wooster was  getting his eight hours.    For directly I opened my eyes on the morrow, I saw daylight. Well, I  don't mean that exactly, because naturally I did. What I mean is that I  found I had the thing all mapped out. The good old subconscious m. had  delivered the goods, and I perceived exactly what steps must be taken in  order to put Augustus Fink-Nottle among the practising Romeos.    I should like you, if you can spare me a moment of your valuable time, to  throw your mind back to that conversation he and I had had in the garden  on the previous evening. Not the glimmering landscape bit, I don't mean  that, but the concluding passages of it. Having done so, you will recall  that when he informed me that he never touched alcoholic liquor, I shook  the head a bit, feeling that this must inevitably weaken him as a force  where proposing to girls was concerned.    And events had shown that my fears were well founded.    Put to the test, with nothing but orange juice inside him, he had proved  a complete bust. In a situation calling for words of molten passion of a  nature calculated to go through Madeline Bassett like a red-hot gimlet  through half a pound of butter, he had said not a syllable that could  bring a blush to the cheek of modesty, merely delivering a well-phrased  but, in the circumstances, quite misplaced lecture on newts.    A romantic girl is not to be won by such tactics. Obviously, before  attempting to proceed further, Augustus Fink-Nottle must be induced to  throw off the shackling inhibitions of the past and fuel up. It must be a  primed, confident Fink-Nottle who squared up to the Bassett for Round No.  2.    Only so could the _Morning Post_ make its ten bob, or whatever it is, for  printing the announcement of the forthcoming nuptials.    Having arrived at this conclusion I found the rest easy, and by the time  Jeeves brought me my tea I had evolved a plan complete in every detail.  This I was about to place before him--indeed, I had got as far as the  preliminary \"I say, Jeeves\"--when we were interrupted by the arrival of  Tuppy.    He came listlessly into the room, and I was pained to observe that a  night's rest had effected no improvement in the unhappy wreck's  appearance. Indeed, I should have said, if anything, that he was looking  rather more moth-eaten than when I had seen him last. If you can  visualize a bulldog which has just been kicked in the ribs and had its  dinner sneaked by the cat, you will have Hildebrand Glossop as he now  stood before me.    \"Stap my vitals, Tuppy, old corpse,\" I said, concerned, \"you're looking  pretty blue round the rims.\"    Jeeves slid from the presence in that tactful, eel-like way of his, and I  motioned the remains to take a seat.    \"What's the matter?\" I said.    He came to anchor on the bed, and for awhile sat picking at the coverlet  in silence.    \"I've been through hell, Bertie.\"    \"Through where?\"    \"Hell.\"    \"Oh, hell? And what took you there?\"    Once more he became silent, staring before him with sombre eyes.  Following his gaze, I saw that he was looking at an enlarged photograph  of my Uncle Tom in some sort of Masonic uniform which stood on the  mantelpiece. I've tried to reason with Aunt Dahlia about this photograph  for years, placing before her two alternative suggestions: (a) To burn  the beastly thing; or (b) if she must preserve it, to shove me in  another room when I come to stay. But she declines to accede. She says  it's good for me. A useful discipline, she maintains, teaching me that  there is a darker side to life and that we were not put into this world  for pleasure only.    \"Turn it to the wall, if it hurts you, Tuppy,\" I said gently.    \"Eh?\"    \"That photograph of Uncle Tom as the bandmaster.\"    \"I didn't come here to talk about photographs. I came for sympathy.\"    \"And you shall have it. What's the trouble? Worrying about Angela, I  suppose? Well, have no fear. I have another well-laid plan for  encompassing that young shrimp. I'll guarantee that she will be weeping  on your neck before yonder sun has set.\"    He barked sharply.    \"A fat chance!\"    \"Tup, Tushy!\"    \"Eh?\"    \"I mean 'Tush, Tuppy.' I tell you I will do it. I was just going to  describe this plan of mine to Jeeves when you came in. Care to hear it?\"    \"I don't want to hear any of your beastly plans. Plans are no good. She's  gone and fallen in love with this other bloke, and now hates my gizzard.\"    \"Rot.\"    \"It isn't rot.\"    \"I tell you, Tuppy, as one who can read the female heart, that this  Angela loves you still.\"    \"Well, it didn't look much like it in the larder last night.\"    \"Oh, you went to the larder last night?\"    \"I did.\"    \"And Angela was there?\"    \"She"]]]
