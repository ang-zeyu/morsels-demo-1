On quitting the wood where we met the native we crossed a plain which  appeared to slope westward. Night was coming on, and I directed my course  towards some tall trees, where we found a hollow, but no water remained  in it; yet here we were nevertheless obliged to encamp. Some of the men  who had set out in search of water had not returned when it became dark;  but on our sending up a rocket they found their way to the camp, although  they had not succeeded in their search for water.    From this camp the summits of the Nundewar range were still visible, and  very useful in determining our longitude. One cone in particular (Mount  Riddell) promised from its height to be a landmark still on these  northern plains. (See below, outline of summits as seen on 12th January.)    REACH THE GWYDIR.    Continuing our journey at half-past five A.M. over the clear plain, we  came upon several ponds, distant not more than a mile from where we had  passed the night. We lost no time in watering the cattle and proceeding.  At half a mile beyond I perceived on the right some very green grass by  the edge of a hollow, overhung by spreading eucalypti. I found there a  fine lagoon of considerable extent, and brim-full of the purest water.  There were no reeds, but short grass grew on the brink, and near the  shore a few waterlilies. Here we filled our keg and kettles. We next  crossed some slightly rising ground, and high in the branches of the  trees I perceived, to my astonishment, dry tufts of grass, old logs, and  other drift matter! I felt confident that we were at length approaching  something new, perhaps the large river, the Kindur of The Bushranger. On  descending by a very gentle slope, a dark and dense line of gigantic  bluegum-trees (eucalyptus) growing amid long grass and reeds, encouraged  our hopes that we had at length found the big river. A narrow tract of  rich soil covered with long grass and seared with deep furrows  intervened. I galloped over this, and beheld a broad silvery expanse,  shaded by steep banks and lofty trees. In this water no current was  perceptible, but the breadth and depth of channel far exceeded that of  the Namoi. Nevertheless this was not the Kindur as described by The  Barber, but evidently the Gwydir of Cunningham, as seen by him at a  higher part of its course. We were exactly in the latitude of the Gwydir,  the course of which was also westward. It was however a very new feature  of the country to us, and after so much privation, heat and exposure the  living stream and umbrageous foliage gave us a grateful sense of  abundance, coolness, and shade. Trees of great magnitude give a grandness  of character to any landscape, but especially to river scenery. The blue  gum (eucalyptus) luxuriates on the margin of rivers, and grows in such  situations to an enormous size. Such trees overhung the water of the  Gwydir, forming dense masses of shade, in which white cockatoos  (Plyctolophus galeritus) sported like spirits of light.    CROSS IT WITH ONE MAN.    As soon as I had fixed on the camp I forded the river, accompanied by  Woods carrying my rifle. The water where I crossed did not reach above  the ankle, but the steepness of the banks on each side was a great  obstacle to the passage of my horse. I proceeded due north, in search of  rising ground, but the whole country seemed quite level. After crossing  an open plain of about two miles in length, I entered a brush of Acacia  pendula, and soon after I arrived at an old channel or hollow scooped out  by floods.    PREVENTED BY A NATIVE WITH SPEARS FROM SHOOTING A KANGAROO.    As I approached a line of bushes I saw a kangaroo which sat looking at my  horse until we were very near it, and I was asking Woods whether he  thought we could manage to carry it back if I shot it; when my horse,  suddenly pricking his ears, drew my attention to a native, apparently  also intent on the kangaroo, and having two spears on his shoulder. On  perceiving me he stood and stared for a moment, then taking one step  back, and swinging his right arm in the air, he poised one of his spears,  and stood stretched out in an attitude to throw. He was a tall man,  covered with pipe-clay, and his position of defiance then, as he could  never have before seen a horse, was manly enough. It was not prudent to  retire at that moment, although I was most anxious to avoid a quarrel. I  therefore galloped my horse at the native, which had the desired effect;  for he immediately turned, and disappeared at a dog-trot among the  bushes.    RE-CROSS THE RIVER.    By going forward I gained a convenient cover, which enabled me to retire  upon the river without seeming to turn, as in fact I did, to avoid  further collision with the natives at so great a distance from the party.  The bed of the river was flat, and consisted of small pebbles, not much  worn by attrition, and mixed with sand. Many dead trees lay in parts of  the channel. The average breadth of the water was forty-five yards; the  breadth from bank to bank seventy-two yards; and the perpendicular height  of the banks above the water twenty-seven feet.    In the afternoon the natives appeared on the opposite bank, and were soon  after heard calling out \"Witefellow, Witefellow.\" Dawkins advanced  quietly to the riverbank to speak to them and encourage them to cross;  but they disappeared as soon as they saw him.    The Barber had stated that the large river was the first water to be met  with after crossing the range in the direction of north-east by north  from Tangulda. We had reached the country beyond that range by going  round it; and had at length found, after crossing various dry channels,  not the great river described by him, but only the Gwydir of Cunningham.  It remained for me to trace this into the interior, as far as might be  necessary to ascertain its ultimate course; with the probability, also,  of discovering its junction with some river of greater importance.

The line of our route to this river described no great detour, and the  trees being marked, as also the ground, by the cartwheels, Mr. Finch  could have no difficulty in following our track THUS far. We were now  however to turn from a northern, to a western course, and I accordingly  explained this to Mr. Finch in a letter which I deposited in a marked  tree, as arranged with him before I set out.    January 10.    This morning it rained heavily, but we left the encampment at six to  pursue the course of the Gwydir. The deep and extensive hollows formed by  the floods of this river compelled us to travel southward for several  miles.    A NATIVE VILLAGE OF BOWERS.    In crossing one hollow we passed among the huts of a native tribe. They  were tastefully distributed amongst drooping acacias and casuarinae; some  resembled bowers under yellow fragrant mimosae; some were isolated under  the deeper shades of casuarinae; while others were placed more socially,  three or four together, fronting to one and the same hearth. Each hut was  semicircular, or circular; the roof conical, and from one side a flat  roof stood forward like a portico, supported by two sticks. Most of them  were close to the trunk of a tree, and they were covered, not as in other  parts, by sheets of bark, but with a variety of materials, such as reeds,  grass, and boughs. The interior of each looked clean and to us, passing  in the rain, gave some idea not only of shelter, but even of comfort and  happiness. They afforded a favourable specimen of the taste of the gins,  whose business it usually is to construct the huts. This village of  bowers also occupied more space than the encampments of native tribes in  general; choice shady spots seemed to have been an object, and had been  selected with care.    EFFECT OF SUDDEN MOISTURE ON THE WHEELS.    We had at length been able to turn westward, keeping the river trees in  view when, the rain continuing, we began to experience the effects of  moisture on the felloes of the wheels. The heat and contraction had  lately obliged us to tighten and wedge them to such a degree that now,  when the ground had become wet, the expansion of the whole broke the  tirering of the wheel. Having no forge we could only attempt the  necessary repairs with a common fire, and for this purpose I left three  men with Mr. White; and I resumed the journey with the rest of the party.  The rain continuing, the soft ground so clogged the wheels that the  draught was very distressing to the bullocks. We pursued a westerly  direction for five miles over ground thinly wooded, with patches of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"ry, that in the appellation which it was  judged proper to give to this extensive group, the French admiral had not  rather thought of doing honour to the original discoverer, or to the  _Gulde Zeepaard_, than to his own ship; more especially, as his  examination was far from being complete. This would have been more  conformable to his general practice; but ARCHIPEL DE LA RECHERCHE was the  name adopted.    Beyond the archipelago, the South Coast was found to trend  east-north-eastward; without any island lying off it, or presenting any  place of shelter. The shore was either a steep calcareous cliff, of an  equal height, or low and sandy, with a few naked hillocks behind; and  above these, no hill., nor any thing of the interior country, could be  discerned. \"It is not surprising,\" says D'Entrecasteaux., \"that Nuyts has  given no details of this barren coast; for its aspect is so uniform, that  the most fruitful imagination could find nothing to say of it.\"    1793.    Frustrated in his expectation of procuring fresh water, and having no  more than sufficient, at a short allowance, to reach Van Diemen's Land,  the admiral abandoned the investigation of the South Coast, on Jan. 3;  being then in latitude 31 deg. 49' south, and longitude 131 deg. 381/2' east of  Greenwich.    In the otherwise excellent charts constructed by M. BEAUTEMPS-BEAUPRE,  geographical engineer on board La Recherche, there is an extraordinary  omission, arising either from the geographer, or the conductor of the  voyage. In the first 12 deg. of longitude no soundings are marked along the  coast; whilst, in the last 50, they are marked with tolerable regularity:  the cause of this difference is not explained.    In comparing the French chart with that of Nuyts, it appeared that the  rear-admiral had not proceeded so far along this coast as the Dutch  navigator had done; for he did not see the islands of St. Francis and St.  Peter, nor the reef marked about thirty leagues to the west of them. The  point, however, where D'Entrecasteaux's examination terminated, was, in  all probability, within a few leagues of that reef; and the end of Nuyts'  discovery would be between 133 deg. and 134 deg. to the east of Greenwich.    CONCLUSIVE REMARKS.    The South Coast was not known, in 1801, to have been visited by any other  than the three navigators, _Nuyts_, _Vancouver_, and _D'Entrecasteaux_.*  The coast line, from Cape Leeuwin to near the longitude of 132 deg., was  generally so well ascertained, and the charts of Vancouver and  D'Entrecasteaux appeared to be so good, that little remained in this  space for future visitors to discover. At two places, the country and  productions near the sea-side had also been examined; though no  communication had any where been obtained with the inhabitants. It was  known also from Nuyts, that at 133 deg. or 134 deg. of east longitude, commenced  a second archipelago; and that the coast began there to assume an  irregular form; but in what direction it trended, whether to the  south-eastward for Bass' Strait, or northward for the Gulph of  Carpentaria, was altogether uncertain.    [* It afterwards appeared, that lieutenant James Grant had discovered a  part of it in 1800, in his way to Port Jackson with His Majesty's brig  Lady Nelson.]    The great point, then, which required to be ascertained, was the form of  the land from longitude 133 deg. to 146 deg. east, and from south latitude 32 deg. to  381/2 deg.; comprising a space of two hundred and fifty leagues in a straight  line. What rendered a knowledge of this part more particularly  interesting, was the circumstance of no considerable river having been  found on any of the coasts of Terra Australis previously explored: but it  was scarcely credible that, if this vast country were one connected mass  of land, it should not contain some large rivers; and if any, this  unknown part was one of two remaining places, where they were expected to  discharge themselves into the sea.    The apparent want of rivers had induced some persons to think, that Terra  Australis might be composed of two or more islands, as had formerly been  suspected by the Dutch, and by Dampier; whilst others, believing in the  continuity of the shores, thought this want might arise from the interior  being principally occupied by a mediterranean sea; but it was generally  agreed, that one end of the separating channels, or otherwise the  entrance, if such existed, into the supposed sea, would most likely be  found in this unexplored part of the South Coast.    Besides the solution of this important geographical problem, something  remained to be done upon the parts already seen. The main land behind the  first archipelago, as also the inner islands, were yet to be examined for  harbours, where refreshment for ships might be obtained; a comparison of  the persons and usages of the inhabitants, with those in other parts of  this vast country, was desirable; and, although little utility could be  drawn from the known productions at the two points visited, it might  reasonably be hoped, that an investigation of a coast so extensive, would  not fail to produce much useful information.    Many circumstances, indeed, united to render the south coast of Terra  Australis one of the most interesting parts of the globe, to which  discovery could be directed at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  Its investigation had formed a part of the instructions to the  unfortunate French navigator La Perouse, and afterwards of those to his  countryman D'Entrecasteaux; and it was, not without some reason,  attributed to England as a reproach, that an imaginary line of more than  two hundred and fifty leagues extent, in the vicinity of of one of her  colonies, should have been so long suffered to remain traced upon the  charts, under the title Of UNKNOWN COAST. This comported ill with her  reputation as the first of maritime powers; and to do it away was,  accordingly, a leading point in the instructions given to the  Investigator.    PRIOR DISCOVERIES IN TERRA AUSTRALIS.    SECTION IV    EAST COAST, WITH VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.    PART I.    Preliminary Observations.  Discoveries of Tasman;  of Cook;  Marion and Furneaux.  Observations of Cook;  Bligh; and Cox.  Discovery of D'Entrecasteaux.  Hayes.    PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.    Van Diemen'S Land would more properly have been arranged under the head  of the South Coast; but the later discoveries here have so intimate a  connexion with those on the East, as to render it impossible to separate  them without making repetitions, and losing perspicuity in the narrative.    The anxiety of the Dutch government at Batavia, to know how far the SOUTH  LANDS might extend towards the antarctic circle, was the cause of Tasman  being sent with two vessels, to ascertain this point; and the discovery  of Van Diemen's Land was one of the results. It was not, however, the  policy of the Dutch government to make discoveries for the benefit of  general knowledge; and accordingly this voyage \"was never,\" says Dr.  Campbell, \"published intire; and it is probable, that the East-India  Company never intended it should be published at all. However, _Dirk  Rembrantz_, moved by the excellency and accuracy of the work, published  in _Low Dutch_ an extract of captain Tasman's journal, which has ever  since been considered as a great curiosity; and as such, has been  translated into many languages.\" *    [* _Complete Collection of Voyages and Travels, originally published by  John Harris, D. D. and F. R. S._ London, 1744. Vol. I. page 325.]    If a judgment may be formed from the translations, Rembrantz must have  omitted great part of the nautical details concerning Van Diemen's Land,  a defect which is remedied in the following account. It is taken from a  journal containing, besides the daily transactions and observations  throughout the whole voyage, a series of thirty-eight manuscript charts,  views, and figures. The expression _by me_, which often occurs in it, and  followed by the signature _Abel Jansz Tasman_, shows that if this were  not his original journal, it is a copy from it: probably one made on  board for the governor and council of Batavia. With this interesting  document, and a translation made in 1776, by Mr. C. G. Woide, chaplain of  His Majesty's Dutch chapel at St. James's, I was favoured by the Right  Hon. SIR JOSEPH BANKS.*    [* I am proud to take this opportunity of publicly expressing my  obligations to the Right Hon. President of the Royal Society; and of thus  adding my voice to the many who, in the pursuit of science, have found in  him a friend and patron. Such he proved in the commencement of my voyage,  and in the whole course of its duration; in the distresses which tyranny  heaped upon those of accident; and after they were overcome. His  extensive and valuable library has been laid open; and has furnished much  that no time or expense, within my reach, could otherwise have procured.]    TASMAN. 1642. (Atlas. Plate VII.)    CAPTAIN ABEL JANSZ TASMAN sailed from Batavia on Aug. 14, 1642, with the  yacht _Heemskerk_ and fly-boat _Zeehaan_; and, after touching at  Mauritius, steered south and eastward upon discovery. Nov. 24, at four  p.m., high land was seen in the E. by N., supposed to be distant forty  miles. The ships steered towards it till the evening; when there were  high mountains visible in the E. S. E., and two smaller ones in the N. E.  They sounded in 100 fathoms, and then stood off from the land, with the  wind at south-east.    In the morning of Nov. 25., it was calm; but on a breeze springing up  from the southward, Tasman steered for the land; and at five p.m., when  it was twelve miles distant, sounded in 60 fathoms, coral bottom: at four  miles off, the bottom was fine white sand. The latitude was then 42 deg. 30'  south; the _mean of all their longitudes_ 163 deg. 50' east (of Teneriffe  apparently); and the compass had no variation."]]]
