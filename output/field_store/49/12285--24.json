Joseph, being seventeen             years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the             lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,             his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their             evil report.    01:037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he             was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many             colours.    01:037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more             than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak             peaceably unto him.    01:037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and             they hated him yet the more.    01:037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I             have dreamed:    01:037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my             sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves             stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.    01:037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?             or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him             yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.    01:037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,             and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,             the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to             me.    01:037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his             father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that             thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren             indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?    01:037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the             saying.    01:037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.    01:037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the             flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he             said to him, Here am I.    01:037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well             with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word             again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came             to Shechem.    01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in             the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?    01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where             they feed their flocks.    01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them             say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,             and found them in Dothan.    01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto             them, they conspired against him to slay him.    01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.    01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into             some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:             and we shall see what will become of his dreams.    01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;             and said, Let us not kill him.    01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into             this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;             that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to             his father again.    01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,             that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many             colours that was on him;    01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was             empty, there was no water in it.    01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes             and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from             Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,             going to carry it down to Egypt.    01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay             our brother, and conceal his blood?    01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our             hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his             brethren were content.    01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and             lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the             Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought             Joseph into Egypt.    01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not             in the pit; and he rent his clothes.    01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;             and I, whither shall I go?    01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,             and dipped the coat in the blood;    01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to             their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether             it be thy son's coat or no.    01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast             hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.    01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,             and mourned for his son many days.    01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;             but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go             down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept             for him.    01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an             officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.    01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from             his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose             name was Hirah.    01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose             name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.    01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.    01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his             name Onan.    01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his             name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.    01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was             Tamar.    01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the             LORD; and the LORD slew him.    01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and             marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.    01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to             pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled             it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his             brother.    01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he             slew him also.    01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow             at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he             said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And             Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.    01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife             died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his             sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the             Adullamite.    01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth             up to Timnath to shear his sheep.    01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her             with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,             which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was             grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.    01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8019"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 19: Psalms (#18)"],[1,"ready to die from my youth up: while I             suffer thy terrors I am distracted.    19:088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.    19:088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me             about together.    19:088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine             acquaintance into darkness.    19:089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth             will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.    19:089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy             faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.    19:089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David             my servant,    19:089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to             all generations.
