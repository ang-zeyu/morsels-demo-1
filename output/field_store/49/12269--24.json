[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#18)"],[1," In my new dignity, I was now openly planning to leave home. Together  with a young friend, Jitendra Mazumdar, {FN10-2} I decided to join a  Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its spiritual discipline.    A desolation fell over me one morning at thought of separation from  my family. Since Mother's death, my affection had grown especially  tender for my two younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed  to my retreat, the little attic which had witnessed so many scenes  in my turbulent SADHANA. {FN10-3} After a two-hour flood of tears,  I felt singularly transformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All  attachment {FN10-4} disappeared; my resolution to seek God as the  Friend of friends set like granite within me. I quickly completed  my travel preparations.    \"I make one last plea.\" Father was distressed as I stood before him  for final blessing. \"Do not forsake me and your grieving brothers  and sisters.\"    \"Revered Father, how can I tell my love for you! But even greater  is my love for the Heavenly Father, who has given me the gift of  a perfect father on earth. Let me go, that I someday return with  a more divine understanding.\"    With reluctant parental consent, I set out to join Jitendra, already  in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival the young head swami,  Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien,  he impressed me favorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure.    I was pleased that my new home possessed an attic, where I managed  to spend the dawn and morning hours. The ashram members, knowing  little of meditation practices, thought I should employ my whole  time in organizational duties. They gave me praise for my afternoon  work in their office.    \"Don't try to catch God so soon!\" This ridicule from a fellow  resident accompanied one of my early departures toward the attic. I  went to Dyananda, busy in his small sanctum overlooking the Ganges.    \"Swamiji, {FN10-5} I don't understand what is required of me here.  I am seeking direct perception of God. Without Him, I cannot be  satisfied with affiliation or creed or performance of good works.\"    The orange-robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging  a mock rebuke, he admonished a few near-by disciples. \"Don't bother  Mukunda. He will learn our ways.\"    I politely concealed my doubt. The students left the room, not overly  bent with their chastisement. Dyananda had further words for me.    \"Mukunda, I see your father is regularly sending you money. Please  return it to him; you require none here. A second injunction for  your discipline concerns food. Even when you feel hunger, don't  mention it.\"    Whether famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry,  I knew only too well. The invariable hour for the first hermitage  meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a  large breakfast at nine o'clock.    The three-hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the  Calcutta years when I could rebuke the cook for a ten-minute delay.  Now I tried to control my appetite; one day I undertook a twenty-four  hour fast. With double zest I awaited the following midday.    \"Dyanandaji's train is late; we are not going to eat until he  arrives.\" Jitendra brought me this devastating news. As gesture  of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for two weeks, many  delicacies were in readiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air.  Nothing else offering, what else could be swallowed except pride  over yesterday's achievement of a fast?    \"Lord hasten the train!\" The Heavenly Provider, I thought, was hardly  included in the interdiction with which Dyananda had silenced me.  Divine Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered  the hours. Darkness was descending as our leader entered the door.  My greeting was one of unfeigned joy.    \"Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food.\"  Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill omen.    I was in near-collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation,  protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of famine victims  passed wraithlike before me.    \"The next Benares death from starvation is due at once in this  hermitage,\" I thought. Impending doom averted at nine o'clock.  Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of life's  perfect hours.    Intense absorption yet permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate  absent-mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures.    \"Swamiji, weren't you hungry?\" Happily surfeited, I was alone with  the leader in his study.    \"O yes! I have spent the last four days without food or drink.  I never eat on trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of  worldly people. Strictly I observe the SHASTRIC {FN10-6} rules for  monks of my particular order.    \"Certain problems of our organizational work lie on my mind.  Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. What's the hurry? Tomorrow  I'll make it a point to have a proper meal.\" He laughed merrily.    Shame spread within me like a suffocation. But the past day of my  torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark.    \"Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never  asked for food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death.\"    \"Die then!\" This alarming counsel split the air. \"Die if you must  Mukunda! Never admit that you live by the power of food and not by  the power of God! He who has created every form of nourishment, He  who has bestowed appetite, will certainly see that His devotee is  sustained!  Do not imagine that rice maintains you, or that money  or men support you! Could they aid if the Lord withdraws your  life-breath? They are His indirect instruments merely. Is it by  any skill of yours that food digests in your stomach? Use the sword  of your discrimination, Mukunda! Cut through the chains of agency  and perceive the Single Cause!\"    I found his incisive words entering some deep marrow. Gone was  an age-old delusion by which bodily imperatives outwit the soul.  There and then I tasted the Spirit's all-sufficiency. In how many  strange cities, in my later life of ceaseless travel, did occasion  arise to prove the serviceability of this lesson in a Benares  hermitage!    The sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the  SADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to me by Mother. Guarding it for  years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew  my joy in the talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked  box.  The sealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet was gone.  Mournfully I tore open its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It  had vanished, in accordance with the SADHU'S prediction, into the  ether whence he had summoned it.    My relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The  household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict  adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left  home and all worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on  all sides.    Torn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved  to pray until answer was vouchsafed.    \"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions,  or through a guru sent by Thee!\"    The passing hours found my sobbing pleas without response. Suddenly  I felt lifted as though bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.    \"Thy Master cometh today!\" A divine womanly voice came from everywhere  and nowhere.    This supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite  locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the  downstairs kitchen.    \"Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand.\"    Another day I might have replied impatiently; now I wiped  my tear-swollen face and meekly obeyed the summons. Together Habu  and I set out for a distant market place in the Bengali section of  Benares. The ungentle Indian sun was not yet at zenith as we made  our purchases in the bazaars. We pushed our way through the colorful  medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified  Brahmins, and the ubiquitous holy bulls. Passing an inconspicuous  lane, I turned my head and surveyed the narrow length.    A Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at  the end of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed;  my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.    \"You are confusing this wandering monk with someone known to you,\"  I thought. \"Dreamer, walk on.\"    After ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As though  turned to stone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously  I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite  direction; again the curious weight oppressed me.    \"The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!\" With this thought,  I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had been observing  my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.    \"What ails you? Are you crazy?\"    My tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away.    Retracing my steps as though wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane.  My quick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my  direction. A few eager steps and I was at his feet.    \"Gurudeva!\" {FN10-7} The divine face was none other than he of my  thousand visions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine head with pointed  beard and flowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal  reveries, holding a promise I had not fully understood.    \"O my own, you have come to me!\" My guru uttered the words again  and again in Bengali, his voice tremulous with joy. \"How many years  I have waited for you!\"    We entered a oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest  superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of  master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed  that my guru knew God, and would lead me to Him. The obscuration  of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1,"fides_, to tell her all about  himself. He supplied the facts in no settled order, just as they  happened to occur to him in the long silences with which his speech was  punctuated. Small facts jostled large facts. He spoke of his morals and  his fox-terrier in the same breath.    'I'm on the level. Ask anyone who knows me. They'll tell you that. Say,  I got the cutest little dog you ever seen. Do you like dogs? I've never  been a fellow that's got himself mixed up with girls. I don't like 'em  as a general thing. A fellow's got too much to do keeping himself in  training, if his club expects him to do things. I belong to the Glencoe  Athletic. I ran the hundred yards dash in evens last sports there was.  They expect me to do it at the Glencoe, so I've never got myself mixed  up with girls. Till I seen you that afternoon I reckon I'd hardly  looked at a girl, honest. They didn't seem to kind of make any hit with  me. And then I seen you, and I says to myself, \"That's the one.\" It  sort of came over me in a flash. I fell for you directly I seen you.  And I'm on the level. Don't forget that.'    And more in the same strain, leaning on the counter and looking into  Katie's eyes with a devotion that added emphasis to his measured  speech.    Next day he came again, and kissed her respectfully but firmly, making  a sort of shuffling dive across the counter. Breaking away, he fumbled  in his pocket and produced a ring, which he proceeded to place on her  finger with the serious air which accompanied all his actions.    'That looks pretty good to me,' he said, as he stepped back and eyed  it.    It struck Katie, when he had gone, how differently different men did  things. Genevieve had often related stories of men who had proposed to  her, and according to Genevieve, they always got excited and emotional,  and sometimes cried. Ted Brady had fitted her with the ring more like a  glover's assistant than anything else, and he had hardly spoken a word  from beginning to end. He had seemed to take her acquiescence for  granted. And yet there had been nothing flat or disappointing about the  proceedings. She had been thrilled throughout. It is to be supposed  that Mr Brady had the force of character which does not require the aid  of speech.    It was not till she took the news of her engagement to old Mr Bennett  that it was borne in upon Katie that Fate did not intend to be so  wholly benevolent to her as she supposed.    That her grandfather could offer any opposition had not occurred to her  as a possibility. She took his approval for granted. Never, as long as  she could remember, had he been anything but kind to her. And the only  possible objections to marriage from a grandfather's point of  view--badness of character, insufficient means, or inferiority of  social position--were in this case gloriously absent.    She could not see how anyone, however hypercritical, could find a flaw  in Ted. His character was spotless. He was comfortably off. And so far  from being in any way inferior socially, it was he who condescended.  For Ted, she had discovered from conversation with Mr Murdoch, the  glazier, was no ordinary young man. He was a celebrity. So much so that  for a moment, when told the news of the engagement, Mr Murdoch,  startled out of his usual tact, had exhibited frank surprise that the  great Ted Brady should not have aimed higher.    'You're sure you've got the name right, Katie?' he had said. 'It's  really Ted Brady? No mistake about the first name? Well-built,  good-looking young chap with brown eyes? Well, this beats me. Not,' he  went on hurriedly, 'that any young fellow mightn't think himself lucky  to get a wife like you, Katie, but Ted Brady! Why, there isn't a girl  in this part of the town, or in Harlem or the Bronx, for that matter,  who wouldn't give her eyes to be in your place. Why, Ted Brady is the  big noise. He's the star of the Glencoe.'    'He told me he belonged to the Glencoe Athletic.'    'Don't you believe it. It belongs to him. Why, the way that boy runs  and jumps is the real limit. There's only Billy Burton, of the  Irish-American, that can touch him. You've certainly got the pick of  the bunch, Katie.'    He stared at her admiringly, as if for the first time realizing her  true worth. For Mr Murdoch was a great patron of sport.    With these facts in her possession Katie had approached the interview  with her grandfather with a good deal of confidence.    The old man listened to her recital of Mr Brady's qualities in silence.  Then he shook his head.    'It can't be, Katie. I couldn't have it.'    'Grandpapa!'    'You're forgetting, my dear.'    'Forgetting?'    'Who ever heard of such a thing? The grand-daughter of the King of  England marrying a commoner! It wouldn't do at all.'    Consternation, surprise, and misery kept Katie dumb. She had learned in  a hard school to be prepared for sudden blows from the hand of fate,  but this one was so entirely unforeseen that it found her unprepared,  and she was crushed by it. She knew her grandfather's obstinacy too  well to argue against the decision.    'Oh, no, not at all,' he repeated. 'Oh, no, it wouldn't do.'    Katie said nothing; she was beyond speech. She stood there wide-eyed  and silent among the ruins of her little air-castle. The old man patted  her hand affectionately. He was pleased at her docility. It was the  right attitude, becoming in one of her high rank.    'I am very sorry, my dear, but--oh, no! oh, no! oh, no--' His voice  trailed away into an unintelligible mutter. He was a very old man, and  he was not always able to concentrate his thoughts on a subject for any  length of time.    So little did Ted Brady realize at first the true complexity of the  situation that he was inclined, when he heard of the news, to treat the  crisis in the jaunty, dashing, love-laughs-at-locksmith fashion so  popular with young men of spirit when thwarted in their loves by the  interference of parents and guardians.    It took Katie some time to convince him that, just because he had the  licence in his pocket, he could not snatch her up on his saddle-bow and  carry her off to the nearest clergyman after the manner of young  Lochinvar.    In the first flush of his resentment at restraint he saw no reason why  he should differentiate between old Mr Bennett and the conventional  banns-forbidding father of the novelettes with which he was accustomed  to sweeten his hours of idleness. To him, till Katie explained the  intricacies of the position, Mr Bennett was simply the proud  millionaire who would not hear of his daughter marrying the artist.    'But, Ted, dear, you don't understand,' Katie said. 'We simply couldn't  do that. There's no one but me to look after him, poor old man. How  could I run away like that and get married? What would become of him?'    'You wouldn't be away long,' urged Mr Brady, a man of many parts, but  not a rapid thinker. 'The minister would have us fixed up inside of  half an hour. Then we'd look in at Mouquin's for a steak and fried,  just to make a sort of wedding breakfast. And then back we'd come,  hand-in-hand, and say, \"Well, here we are. Now what?\"'    'He would never forgive me.'    'That,' said Ted judicially, 'would be up to him.'    'It would kill him. Don't you see, we know that it's all nonsense, this  idea of his; but he really thinks he is the king, and he's so old that  the shock of my disobeying him would be too much. Honest, Ted, dear, I  couldn't.'    Gloom unutterable darkened Ted Brady's always serious countenance. The  difficulties of the situation were beginning to come home to him.    'Maybe if I went and saw him--' he suggested at last.    'You _could_,' said Katie doubtfully.    Ted tightened his belt with an air of determination, and bit resolutely  on the chewing-gum which was his inseparable companion.    'I will,' he said.    'You'll be nice to him, Ted?'    He nodded. He was the man of action, not words.    It was perhaps ten minutes before he came out of the inner room in  which Mr Bennett passed his days. When he did, there was no light of  jubilation on his face. His brow was darker than ever.    Katie looked at him anxiously. He returned the look with a sombre shake  of the head.    'Nothing doing,' he said shortly. He paused. 'Unless,' he added, 'you  count it anything that he's made me an earl.'    In the next two weeks several brains busied themselves with the  situation. Genevieve, reconciled to Katie after a decent interval of  wounded dignity, said she supposed there was a way out, if one could  only think of it, but it certainly got past her. The only approach to a  plan of action was suggested by the broken-nosed individual who had  been Ted's companion that day at Palisades Park, a gentleman of some  eminence in the boxing world, who rejoiced in the name of the Tennessee  Bear-Cat.    What they ought to do, in the Bear-Cat's opinion, was to get the old  man out into Washington Square one morning. He of Tennessee would then  sasshay up in a flip manner and make a break. Ted, waiting close by,  would resent his insolence. There would be words, followed by blows.    'See what I mean?' pursued the Bear-Cat. 'There's you and me mixing it.  I'll square the cop on the beat to leave us be; he's a friend of mine.  Pretty soon you land me one on the plexus, and I take th' count. Then  there's you hauling me up by th' collar to the old gentleman, and me  saying I quits and apologizing. See what I mean?'    The whole, presumably, to conclude with warm expressions of gratitude  and esteem from Mr Bennett, and an instant withdrawal of the veto.    Ted himself approved of the scheme. He said it was a cracker-jaw, and  he wondered how one so notoriously ivory-skulled as the other could  have had such an idea. The Bear-Cat said modestly that he had 'em  sometimes. And it is probable that all would have been well, had it not  been necessary to tell the plan to Katie, who was"]]]
