And being at length able to bear no more of it, witting that the  gentleman had got into a mess and was not like to get out of it, she said  pleasantly to him:--\"Sir, this horse of yours trots too hard; I pray you  be pleased to set me down.\" The gentleman, being perchance more quick of  apprehension than he was skilful in narration, missed not the meaning of  her sally, and took it in all good and gay humour. So, leaving unfinished  the tale which he had begun, and so mishandled, he addressed himself to  tell her other stories.    (1) Cf. First Day, Novel X.      NOVEL II.    --  Cisti, a baker, by an apt speech gives Messer Geri Spina to know that he  has by inadvertence asked that of him which he should not.  --    All the ladies and the men alike having greatly commended Madonna  Oretta's apt saying, the queen bade Pampinea follow suit, and thus she  began:--    Fair ladies, I cannot myself determine whether Nature or Fortune be the  more at fault, the one in furnishing a noble soul with a vile body, or  the other in allotting a base occupation to a body endowed with a noble  soul, whereof we may have seen an example, among others, in our  fellow-citizen, Cisti; whom, furnished though he was with a most lofty  soul, Fortune made a baker. And verily I should curse Nature and Fortune  alike, did I not know that Nature is most discreet, and that Fortune,  albeit the foolish imagine her blind, has a thousand eyes. For 'tis, I  suppose, that, being wise above a little, they do as mortals ofttimes do,  who, being uncertain as to their future, provide against contingencies by  burying their most precious treasures in the basest places in their  houses, as being the least likely to be suspected; whence, in the hour of  their greatest need, they bring them forth, the base place having kept  them more safe than the dainty chamber would have done. And so these two  arbitresses of the world not seldom hide their most precious commodities  in the obscurity of the crafts that are reputed most base, that thence  being brought to light they may shine with a brighter splendour. Whereof  how in a trifling matter Cisti, the baker, gave proof, restoring the eyes  of the mind to Messer Geri Spina, whom the story of his wife, Madonna  Oretta, has brought to my recollection, I am minded to shew you in a  narrative which shall be of the briefest.    I say then that Pope Boniface, with whom Messer Geri Spina stood very  high in favour and honour, having sent divers of his courtiers to  Florence as ambassadors to treat of certain matters of great moment, and  they being lodged in Messer Geri's house, where he treated with them of  the said affairs of the Pope, 'twas, for some reason or another, the wont  of Messer Geri and the ambassadors of the Pope to pass almost every  morning by Santa Maria Ughi, where Cisti, the baker, had his bakehouse,  and plied his craft in person. Now, albeit Fortune had allotted him a  very humble occupation, she had nevertheless prospered him therein to  such a degree that he was grown most wealthy, and without ever aspiring  to change it for another, lived in most magnificent style, having among  his other good things a cellar of the best wines, white and red, that  were to be found in Florence, or the country parts; and marking Messer  Geri and the ambassadors of the Pope pass every morning by his door, he  bethought him that, as 'twas very hot, 'twould be a very courteous thing  to give them to drink of his good wine; but comparing his rank with that  of Messer Geri, he deemed it unseemly to presume to invite him, and cast  about how he might lead Messer Geri to invite himself. So, wearing always  the whitest of doublets and a spotless apron, that denoted rather the  miller, than the baker, he let bring, every morning about the hour that  he expected Messer Geri and the ambassadors to pass by his door, a  spick-and-span bucket of fresh and cool spring water, and a small  Bolognese flagon of his good white wine, and two beakers that shone like  silver, so bright were they: and there down he sat him, as they came by,  and after hawking once or twice, fell a drinking his wine with such gusto  that 'twould have raised a thirst in a corpse. Which Messer Geri having  observed on two successive mornings, said on the third:--\"What is't,  Cisti? Is't good?\" Whereupon Cisti jumped up, and answered:--\"Ay, Sir,  good it is; but in what degree I might by no means make you understand,  unless you tasted it.\" Messer Geri, in whom either the heat of the  weather, or unwonted fatigue, or, perchance, the gusto with which he had  seen Cisti drink, had bred a thirst, turned to the ambassadors and said  with a smile:--\"Gentlemen, 'twere well to test the quality of this worthy  man's wine: it may be such that we shall not repent us.\" And so in a body  they came up to where Cisti stood; who, having caused a goodly bench to  be brought out of the bakehouse, bade them be seated, and to their  servants, who were now coming forward to wash the beakers, said:--\"Stand  back, comrades, and leave this office to me, for I know as well how to  serve wine as to bake bread; and expect not to taste a drop yourselves.\"  Which said, he washed four fine new beakers with his own hands, and  having sent for a small flagon of his good wine, he heedfully filled the  beakers, and presented them to Messer Geri and his companions; who deemed  the wine the best that they had drunk for a great while. So Messer Geri,  having praised the wine not a little, came there to drink every morning  with the ambassadors as long as they tarried with him.    Now when the ambassadors had received their conge, and were about to  depart, Messer Geri gave a grand banquet, to which he bade some of the  most honourable of the citizens, and also Cisti, who could by no means be  induced to come. However, Messer Geri bade one of his servants go fetch a  flask of Cisti's wine, and serve half a beaker thereof to each guest at  the first course. The servant, somewhat offended, perhaps, that he had  not been suffered to taste any of the wine, took with him a large flask,  which Cisti no sooner saw, than:--\"Son,\" quoth he, \"Messer Geri does not  send thee to me\": and often as the servant affirmed that he did, he could  get no other answer: wherewith he was fain at last to return to Messer  Geri. \"Go, get thee back, said Messer Geri, and tell him that I do send  thee to him, and if he answers thee so again, ask him, to whom then I  send thee.\" So the servant came back, and said:--\"Cisti, Messer Geri  does, for sure, send me to thee.\" \"Son,\" answered Cisti, \"Messer Geri  does, for sure, not send thee to me.\" \"To whom then,\" said the servant,  \"does he send me?\" \"To Arno,\" returned Cisti. Which being reported by the  servant to Messer Geri, the eyes of his mind were straightway opened,  and:--\"Let me see,\" quoth he to the servant, \"what flask it is thou  takest there.\" And when he had seen it:--\"Cisti says sooth,\" he added;  and having sharply chidden him, he caused him take with him a suitable  flask, which when Cisti saw:--\"Now know I,\" quoth he, \"that 'tis indeed  Messer Geri that sends thee to me,\" and blithely filled it. And having  replenished the rundlet that same day with wine of the same quality, he  had it carried with due care to Messer Geri's house, and followed after  himself; where finding Messer Geri he said:--\"I would not have you think,  Sir, that I was appalled by the great flask your servant brought me this  morning; 'twas but that I thought you had forgotten that which by my  little beakers I gave you to understand, when you were with me of late;  to wit, that this is no table wine; and so wished this morning to refresh  your memory. Now, however, being minded to keep the wine no longer, I  have sent you all I have of it, to be henceforth entirely at your  disposal.\" Messer Geri set great store by Cisti's gift, and thanked him  accordingly, and ever made much of him and entreated him as his friend.      NOVEL III.    --  Monna Nonna de' Pulci by a ready retort silences the scarce seemly  jesting of the Bishop of Florence.  --    Pampinea's story ended, and praise not a little bestowed on Cisti alike  for his apt speech and for his handsome present, the queen was pleased to  call forthwith for a story from Lauretta, who blithely thus began:--    Debonair my ladies, the excellency of wit, and our lack thereof, have  been noted with no small truth first by Pampinea and after her by  Filomena. To which topic 'twere bootless to return: wherefore to that  which has been said touching the nature of wit I purpose but to add one  word, to remind you that its bite should be as a sheep's bite and not as  a dog's; for if it bite like a dog, 'tis no longer wit but discourtesy.  With which maxim the words of Madonna Oretta, and the apt reply of Cisti,  accorded excellently. True indeed it is that if 'tis by way of retort,  and one that has received a dog's bite gives the biter a like bite in  return, it does not seem to be reprehensible, as otherwise it would have  been. Wherefore one must consider how and when and on whom and likewise  where one exercises one's wit. By ill observing which matters one of our  prelates did once upon a time receive no less shrewd a bite than he gave;  as I will shew you in a short story.

Ind._ ii, p. 48; _Hume,  Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 422.    Mr. Gammie says:--\"I have found altogether seven nests of the  Crimson-winged Laughing-Thrush in and about Rishap, at elevations  between 4000 and 5000 feet, and on various dates between the 4th and  23rd May. The locality chosen for the nest is in some moist forest  amongst dense undergrowth. It is placed in shrubs, at heights of from  6 to 10 feet from the ground, and is generally suspended between  several upright stems, to which it is firmly attached by fibres. It is  chiefly composed of dry bamboo-leaves and a few twigs, and lined with  black fibres and moss-roots. A few strings of moss are twisted round  it externally to aid in concealing it. It is a moderately deep cup,  measuring externally about 5 inches in diameter and 4 inches in  height, and internally 31/2 inches in width and 2 inches in depth.    \"The eggs are almost always three in number, but occasionally only  two. Of the seven nests taken by me, five contained eggs and two young  birds.\"    The Crimson-winged Laughing-Thrush, according to Mr. Hodgson's notes,  breeds in Sikhim, at elevations of from 3000 to 5000 feet, during the  months of April, May, and June. The nest is placed in the fork of some  thick bush or small tree, where three or four sprays divide, at from 2  to 5 feet above the ground. The nest is a very deep compact cup. One  measured _in situ_ was 4.5 inches in diameter and the same in height  externally, while the cavity was 3 inches in diameter and 2.25  deep. It was very compact and was composed of dry leaves, creepers,  grass-flowers, and vegetable fibres, more or less lined with  moss-roots and coated externally with dry bamboo-leaves. They lay, we  are told, three or four eggs.    Dr. Jerdon says:--\"A nest and eggs said to be of this bird were  brought to me at Darjeeling; the nest made of roots and grass, and the  eggs, three in number, pale blue, with a few narrow and wavy dusky  streaks.\"    The eggs are singularly lovely. In shape they are elongated ovals,  generally very obtuse at both ends, and many of them exhibiting  cylindrical or pyriform tendencies. The shell is very fine and fairly  glossy, and the ground-colour is a most beautiful clear pale sea-green  in some, greenish blue in others. The character of the markings  is more that of the Buntings than of this family. There are a few  strongly marked deep maroon, generally more or less angular, spots or  dashes, principally about the large end, and there are a few spots  and tiny clouds of pale soft purple, and then there are an infinite  variety of hair-line hieroglyphics, twisted and scrawled in brownish  or reddish purple, about the egg. The markings are nowhere as a rule  crowded, and towards the small end are usually sparse and occasionally  wholly wanting. In some eggs a bad pen seems to have been used to  scribble the pattern, and every here and there instead of a fine  hair-line there is a coarse thick one.    The eggs are pretty constant in size and colour, but here and there  an abnormally pale specimen, in which the green has almost entirely  disappeared, is met with. In length they vary from 0.98 to 1.15, and  in breadth from 0.7 to 0.82, but the average of thirty-one eggs is  1.04 by 0.74.      88.

The Olivaceous or Plain-coloured Laughing-Thrush breeds, according  to Mr. Hodgson's notes, in the central region of Nepal from April to  June. It nests in open forests and groves, building its nest on some  low branch of a tree, 2 or 3 feet from the ground, between a number of  twigs. The nest is large and cup-shaped: one measured externally 5.5  inches in diameter and 3.38 in height; internally 2.75 deep and 3.12  in diameter. The nest is composed externally of grass and mosses  lined with soft bamboo-leaves. Three or four eggs are laid, unspotted  greenish blue. One is figured as 1.07 by 0.7.      90.

The Eastern Variegated Laughing-Thrush breeds only at elevations of  from 4000 to 7000 or 8000 feet, from Simla to Nepal, during the latter  half of April, May, and June. The nest is a pretty compact, rather  shallow cup, composed exteriorly of coarse grass, in which a few  dead leaves are intermingled; it has no lining, but the interior is  composed of rather finer and softer grass than the exterior, and  a good number of dry needle-like fir-leaves are used towards the  interior. It is from 5 to 8 inches in diameter exteriorly, and the  cavity from 3 inches to 3.5 in diameter and about 2 inches deep. The  nest is usually placed in some low, densely-foliaged branch of a tree,  at say from 3 to 8 feet from the ground; but I recently obtained one  placed in a thick tuft of grass, growing at the roots of a young  Deodar, not above 6 inches from the ground. They lay four or five  eggs.    The first egg that I obtained of this species, sent me by Sir E.C.  Buck, C.S., and taken by himself near Narkunda, late in June, out of  a nest containing two eggs and two young ones, was a nearly perfect,  rather long oval, and precisely the same type of egg as those of _T.  erythrocephalum_ and _T. cachinnans_, but considerably smaller than  the former. The ground-colour is a pale, rather dingy greenish blue,  and it is blotched, spotted, and speckled, almost exclusively at the  larger end, and even there not very thickly, with reddish brown.  The egg appeared to have but little gloss. Other eggs subsequently  obtained by myself were very similar, but slightly larger and rather  more thickly and boldly blotched, the majority of the markings being  still at the large end.    The colour of the markings varies a good deal: a liver-red is perhaps  the most common, but yellowish brown, pale purple, purplish red, and  brownish red also occur. Here and there an egg is met with almost  entirely devoid of markings, with perhaps only one moderately large  spot and a dozen specks, and these so deep a red as to be all but  black.    The eggs vary from 1.07 to 1.15 in length, and from 0.76 to 0.82 in  breadth.      91. Trochalopterum simile, Hume. _The Western Variegated  Laughing-Thrush_.

We found one nest  on the 15th June, about twenty feet up a spruce-fir at the extremity  of the bough. Nest deep, cup-shaped, solidly built of grass, roots,  and twigs; the bird sits close.

From Sikhim my friend Mr. Gammie writes:--\"I have never as yet found  more than one nest of the Blue-winged Laughing-Thrush, and this one  was found on the 18th May at Mongphoo, at an elevation of about 3500  feet. The nest was placed in a bush (one of the _Zingiberaceae_),  growing in a marshy place, in the midst of dense scrub, at a height  of about 4 feet from the ground, and was firmly attached to several  upright stems. It was composed of dry bamboo-leaves, held together by  the stems of delicate creepers, and was lined with a few black fibres.  It was cup-shaped, and measured externally 5.7 in diameter by 3.6  in height, and internally 3.7 in width by 2.6 in depth. The nest  contained three eggs, which were unfortunately almost ready to hatch  off, so that three is probably the normal number of the eggs.\"    According to Mr. Hodgson's notes the Blue-winged Laughing-Thrush  breeds in May and June in the central region of Nepal in forests, at  elevations of from 2000 to 6000 feet. The nest is placed in a fork of  a branch on some small tree, and is a large mass of dry leaves and  coarse dry grass, 7 or 8 inches in diameter externally, mortar-shaped,  the cavity about 2.5 deep, and lined with hair-like fibres. The nest,  though composed of loose materials, is very firm and compact. They lay  four or five eggs, unspotted, verditer-blue, one of which is figured  as a broad regular oval, only slightly compressed towards one end,  measuring 1.2 by 0.9.    One of the eggs taken by Mr. Gammie (the others were unfortunately  broken) is a long, almost cylindrical, oval, very obtuse at both ends  and slightly compressed towards the smaller end, so that the egg has  a pyriform tendency. It measures 1.25 by 0.82. The colour is an  excessively pale greenish blue, precisely the same as that of the eggs  of _Sturnia malabarica_; but then this present egg was nearly ready to  hatch off when taken, and the fresh eggs are somewhat deeper coloured.    Subsequent to his letter above quoted, Mr. Gammie on the 10th June  found a second nest of this species similar to the first, containing  three nearly fresh eggs. These are similar in shape to that above  described, but in colour are a beautiful clear verditer-blue,  altogether a much brighter and richer tint than that of the first.  They measure 1.2 and 1.25 by 0.88.    One nest was taken by Mr. Gammie above Mongphoo at an elevation of  about 4500 feet on the 30th of April. It was placed in a bush at a  height of about 6 feet from the ground, and contained three fresh  eggs. It was a loosely put together, massive cup, some 7 inches in  diameter and 4 in height externally. It was composed mainly of  fine twigs, creeper-stems, and grass, with a few bamboo-leaves  intermingled, and the cavity was carefully lined with bamboo-leaves,  and then within that thinly with black"]]]
