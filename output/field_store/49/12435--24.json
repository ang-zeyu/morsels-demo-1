They had now only to descend  the mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of  view, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.    But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding  said to them in a calm, grave voice,--    \"Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of  the Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time,  perhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes  by chance. I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there  is not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared  that it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say,  too much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of  the Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia  by doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from  you--\"    \"And you are right, my dear Cyrus,\" replied the reporter, with  animation. \"You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and  you can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?\"    \"I will obey you in everything, captain,\" said Herbert, seizing the  engineer's hand.    \"My master always, and everywhere!\" cried Neb.    \"As for me,\" said the sailor, \"if I ever grumble at work, my name's not  Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America  of this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start  telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in  order and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of  the Union. Only, I ask one thing.\"    \"What is that?\" said the reporter.    \"It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists,  who have come here to settle.\" Harding could not help smiling, and the  sailor's idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added,  that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.    \"Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!\" cried Pencroft.    \"One minute, my friends,\" said the engineer. \"It seems to me it would  be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes,  promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.    \"Very good,\" said the reporter. \"In the future, that will simplify the  instructions which we shall have to give and follow.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the sailor, \"already it is something to be able to say  where one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like  somewhere.\"    \"The Chimneys, for example,\" said Herbert.    \"Exactly!\" replied Pencroft. \"That name was the most convenient, and it  came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for  our first encampment, captain?\"    \"Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.\"    \"Good! as for the others, that will be easy,\" returned the sailor, who  was in high spirits. \"Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did,  whose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point,  Cape Disappointment!\"    \"Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding,\" said Herbert, \"of Mr.  Spilett, of Neb!--\"    \"My name!\" cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.    \"Why not?\" replied Pencroft. \"Port Neb, that would do very well! And  Cape Gideon--\"    \"I should prefer borrowing names from our country,\" said the reporter,  \"which would remind us of America.\"    \"Yes, for the principal ones,\" then said Cyrus Harding; \"for those of  the bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay  on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on  the south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing,  that of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes,  that of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names  will recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have  honored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we  perceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which  will recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better  on our memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of  the island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine  what it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in  different parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks  which afterwards will be discovered, we can christen them as we find  them. What do you think, my friends?\"    The engineer's proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The  island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to  give names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write  them down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be  definitely adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain,  Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had  suggested.    \"Now,\" said the reporter, \"to this peninsula at the southwest of the  island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of  Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a  reptile's tail.\"    \"Adopted,\" said the engineer.    \"Now,\" said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, \"let  us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark  Gulf.\"    \"Capital!\" cried Pencroft, \"and we can complete the resemblance by  naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.\"    \"But there are two capes,\" observed the reporter.    \"Well,\" replied Pencroft, \"we can have North Mandible Cape and South  Mandible Cape.\"    \"They are inscribed,\" said Spilett.    \"There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to  be named,\" said Pencroft.    \"That is, the extremity of Union Bay?\" asked Herbert.    \"Claw Cape,\" cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some  part of his domain.    In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like  the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped  island represented.    Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their  imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with  drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of  the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the  castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau  which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from  whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of  Prospect Heights.    Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine  Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.    The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was  thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh  discoveries.    As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by  the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect  Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the  rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this  rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly,  for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the  sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and  not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those  places situated in the Northern Hemisphere.    Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount  Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,--    \"Well! we are preciously stupid!\"    \"Why?\" asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to  depart.    \"Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!\"    Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer's name and all his  companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,--    \"Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now  struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it  Lincoln Island!\"    The engineer's proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.    And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their  absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with  blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and  that the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks  to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!    Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen  days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and  that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.        Chapter 12    They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater,  they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous  night. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of  the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.    That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had  been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an  instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the  reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.    As to the engineer's watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time  which he had passed on the downs.    The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun  that it must be about nine o'clock in the morning, he put his watch at  that hour.    \"No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you  not?\"    \"Yes, Cyrus.\"    \"Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is  almost that of Washington?\"    \"Undoubtedly.\"    \"Very well, keep it thus.

The only harm they did  him was that inflicted through the medium of the educational rod, when  his surreptitious readings were discovered and his treasures thrown to  the flames amid tears copious enough to extinguish them.          CHAPTER VI.    \"REB\" SHEMUEL.           \"The Torah is greater than the priesthood and than royalty, seeing       that royalty demands thirty qualifications, the priesthood       twenty-four, while the Torah is acquired by forty-eight. And these       are they: By audible study; by distinct pronunciation; by       understanding and discernment of the heart; by awe, reverence,       meekness, cheerfulness; by ministering to the sages; by attaching       oneself to colleagues; by discussion with disciples; _by_       sedateness; by knowledge of the Scripture and of the Mishnah; by       moderation in business, in intercourse with the world, in pleasure,       in sleep, in conversation, in laughter; by long suffering; by a       good heart; by faith in the wise; by resignation under       chastisement; by recognizing one's place, rejoicing in one's       portion, putting a fence to one's words, claiming no merit for       oneself; by being beloved, loving the All-present, loving mankind,       loving just courses, rectitude and reproof; by keeping oneself far       from honors, not boasting of one's learning, nor delighting in       giving decisions; by bearing the yoke with one's fellow, judging       him favorably and leading him to truth and peace; by being composed       in one's study; by asking and answering, hearing and adding thereto       (by one's own reflection), by learning with the object of teaching       and learning with the object of practising, by making one's master       wiser, fixing attention upon his discourse, and reporting a thing       in the name of him who said it. So thou hast learnt. Whosoever       reports a thing in the name of him that said it brings deliverance       into the world, as it is said--And Esther told the King in the name       of Mordecai.\"--(_Ethics of the Fathers_, Singer's translation.)    Moses Ansell only occasionally worshipped at the synagogue of \"The Sons  of the Covenant,\" for it was too near to make attendance a _Mitzvah_,  pleasing in the sight of Heaven. It was like having the prayer-quorum  brought to you, instead of your going to it. The pious Jew must speed to  _Shool_ to show his eagerness and return slowly, as with reluctant feet,  lest Satan draw the attention of the Holy One to the laches of His  chosen people. It was not easy to express these varying emotions on a  few nights of stairs, and so Moses went farther afield, in subtle  minutiae like this Moses was _facile princeps_, being as Wellhausen puts  it of the _virtuosi_ of religion. If he put on his right stocking (or  rather foot lappet, for he did not wear stockings) first, he made amends  by putting on the left boot first, and if he had lace-up boots, then the  boot put on second would have a compensatory precedence in the lacing.  Thus was the divine principle of justice symbolized even in these small  matters.    Moses was a great man in several of the more distant _Chevras_, among  which he distributed the privilege of his presence. It was only when by  accident the times of service did not coincide that Moses favored the  \"Sons of the Covenant,\" putting in an appearance either at the  commencement or the fag end, for he was not above praying odd bits of  the service twice over, and even sometimes prefaced or supplemented his  synagogal performances by solo renditions of the entire ritual of a  hundred pages at home. The morning services began at six in summer and  seven in winter, so that the workingman might start his long day's work  fortified.    At the close of the service at the Beth Hamidrash a few mornings after  the Redemption of Ezekiel, Solomon went up to Reb Shemuel, who in return  for the privilege of blessing the boy gave him a halfpenny. Solomon  passed it on to his father, whom he accompanied.    \"Well, how goes it, Reb Meshe?\" said Reb Shemuel with his cheery smile,  noticing Moses loitering. He called him \"Reb\" out of courtesy and in  acknowledgment of his piety. The real \"Reb\" was a fine figure of a man,  with matter, if not piety, enough for two Moses Ansells. Reb was a  popular corruption of \"Rav\" or Rabbi.    \"Bad,\" replied Moses. \"I haven't had any machining to do for a month.  Work is very slack at this time of year. But God is good.\"    \"Can't you sell something?\" said Reb Shemuel, thoughtfully caressing his  long, gray-streaked black beard.    \"I have sold lemons, but the four or five shillings I made went in bread  for the children and in rent. Money runs through the fingers somehow,  with a family of five and a frosty winter. When the lemons were gone I  stood where I started.\"    The Rabbi sighed sympathetically and slipped half-a-crown into Moses's  palm. Then he hurried out. His boy, Levi, stayed behind a moment to  finish a transaction involving the barter of a pea-shooter for some of  Solomon's buttons. Levi was two years older than Solomon, and was  further removed from him by going to a \"middle class school.\" His manner  towards Solomon was of a corresponding condescension. But it took a  great deal to overawe Solomon, who, with the national humor, possessed  the national _Chutzpah_, which is variously translated enterprise,  audacity, brazen impudence and cheek.    \"I say, Levi,\" he said, \"we've got no school to-day. Won't you come  round this morning and play I-spy-I in our street? There are some  splendid corners for hiding, and they are putting up new buildings all  round with lovely hoardings, and they're knocking down a pickle  warehouse, and while you are hiding in the rubbish you sometimes pick up  scrumptious bits of pickled walnut. Oh, golly, ain't they prime!'\"    Levi turned up his nose.    \"We've got plenty of whole walnuts at home,\" he said.    Solomon felt snubbed. He became aware that this tall boy had smart black  clothes, which would not be improved by rubbing against his own greasy  corduroys.    \"Oh, well,\" he said, \"I can get lots of boys, and girls, too.\"    \"Say,\" said Levi, turning back a little. \"That little girl your father  brought upstairs here on the Rejoicing of the Law, that was your sister,  wasn't it?\"    \"Esther, d'ye mean?\"    \"How should I know? A little, dark girl, with a print dress, rather  pretty--not a bit like you.\"    \"Yes, that's our Esther--she's in the sixth standard and only eleven.\"    \"We don't have standards in our school!\" said Levi contemptuously. \"Will  your sister join in the I-spy-I?\"    \"No, she can't run,\" replied Solomon, half apologetically. \"She only  likes to read. She reads all my 'Boys of England' and things, and now  she's got hold of a little brown book she keeps all to herself. I like  reading, too, but I do it in school or in _Shool_, where there's nothing  better to do.\"    \"Has she got a holiday to-day, too?\"    \"Yes,\" said Solomon.    \"But my school's open,\" said Levi enviously, and Solomon lost the  feeling of inferiority, and felt avenged.    \"Come, then, Solomon,\" said his father, who had reached the door. The  two converted part of the half-crown into French loaves and carried them  home to form an unexpected breakfast.    Meantime Reb Shemuel, whose full name was the Reverend Samuel Jacobs,  also proceeded to breakfast. His house lay near the _Shool_, and was  approached by an avenue of mendicants. He arrived in his shirt-sleeves.    \"Quick, Simcha, give me my new coat. It is very cold this morning.\"    \"You've given away your coat again!\" shrieked his wife, who, though her  name meant \"Rejoicing,\" was more often upbraiding.    \"Yes, it was only an old one, Simcha,\" said the Rabbi deprecatingly. He  took off his high hat and replaced it by a little black cap which he  carried in his tail pocket.    \"You'll ruin me, Shemuel!\" moaned Simcha, wringing her hands. \"You'd  give away the shirt off your skin to a pack of good-for-nothing  _Schnorrers_.\"    \"Yes, if they had only their skin in the world. Why not?\" said the old  Rabbi, a pacific gleam in his large gazelle-like eyes. \"Perhaps my coat  may have the honor to cover Elijah the prophet.\"    \"Elijah the prophet!\" snorted Simcha. \"Elijah has sense enough to stay  in heaven and not go wandering about shivering in the fog and frost of  this God-accursed country.\"    The old Rabbi answered, \"Atschew!\"    \"For thy salvation do I hope, O Lord,\" murmured Simcha piously in  Hebrew, adding excitedly in English, \"Ah, you'll kill yourself,  Shemuel.\" She rushed upstairs and returned with another coat and a new  terror.    \"Here, you fool, you've been and done a fine thing this time! All your  silver was in the coat you've given away!\"    \"Was it?\" said Reb Shemuel, startled. Then the tranquil look returned to  his brown eyes. \"No, I took it all out before I gave away the coat.\"    \"God be thanked!\" said Simcha fervently in Yiddish. \"Where is it? I want  a few shillings for grocery.\"    \"I gave it away before, I tell you!\"    Simcha groaned and fell into her chair with a crash that rattled the  tray and shook the cups.    \"Here's the end of the week coming,\" she sobbed, \"and I shall have no  fish for _Shabbos_.\"    \"Do not blaspheme!\" said Reb Shemuel, tugging a little angrily at his  venerable beard. \"The Holy One, blessed be He, will provide for our  _Shabbos_\"    Simcha made a sceptical mouth, knowing that it was she and nobody else  whose economies would provide for the due celebration of the Sabbath.  Only by a constant course of vigilance, mendacity and petty peculation  at her husband's expense could she manage to support the family of four  comfortably on his pretty considerable salary.
