'By the way, that reminds me,' said the king, 'that for as long as we  have been married, I have never seen your feet, queen.  I think you  might take off your shoes when you go to bed!  They positively hurt me  sometimes.'    'I will do as I like,' retorted the queen sulkily.    'You ought to do as your own hubby wishes you,' said the king.    'I will not,' said the queen.    'Then I insist upon it,' said the king.    Apparently His Majesty approached the queen for the purpose of  following the advice given by Curdie, for the latter heard a scuffle,  and then a great roar from the king.    'Will you be quiet, then?' said the queen wickedly.    'Yes, yes, queen.  I only meant to coax you.'    'Hands off!' cried the queen triumphantly.  'I'm going to bed.  You may  come when you like.  But as long as I am queen I will sleep in my  shoes.  It is my royal privilege.  Harelip, go to bed.'    'I'm going,' said Harelip sleepily.    'So am I,' said the king.    'Come along, then,' said the queen; 'and mind you are good, or I'll--'    'Oh, no, no, no!' screamed the king in the most supplicating of tones.    Curdie heard only a muttered reply in the distance; and then the cave  was quite still.    They had left the fire burning, and the light came through brighter  than before.  Curdie thought it was time to try again if anything could  be done.  But he found he could not get even a finger through the chink  between the slab and the rock.  He gave a great rush with his shoulder  against the slab, but it yielded no more than if it had been part of  the rock.  All he could do was to sit down and think again.    By and by he came to the resolution to pretend to be dying, in the hope  they might take him out before his strength was too much exhausted to  let him have a chance.  Then, for the creatures, if he could but find  his axe again, he would have no fear of them; and if it were not for  the queen's horrid shoes, he would have no fear at all.    Meantime, until they should come again at night, there was nothing for  him to do but forge new rhymes, now his only weapons.  He had no  intention of using them at present, of course; but it was well to have  a stock, for he might live to want them, and the manufacture of them  would help to while away the time.        CHAPTER 20    Irene's Clue    That same morning early, the princess woke in a terrible fright. There  was a hideous noise in her room--creatures snarling and hissing and  rocketing about as if they were fighting.  The moment she came to  herself, she remembered something she had never thought of again--what  her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened.  She  immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow.  As she did  so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under  her palm.  'It must be my grandmother!' she said to herself, and the  thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty  little slippers before running from the room.  While doing this she  caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue, thrown over the back of a  chair by the bedside.  She had never seen it before but it was  evidently waiting for her.  She put it on, and then, feeling with the  forefinger of her right hand, soon found her grandmother's thread,  which she proceeded at once to follow, expecting it would lead her  straight up the old stair. When she reached the door she found it went  down and ran along the floor, so that she had almost to crawl in order  to keep a hold of it.  Then, to her surprise, and somewhat to her  dismay, she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it  turned in quite the opposite direction.  It led her through certain  narrow passages towards the kitchen, turning aside ere she reached it,  and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard.  Some of the maids were already up, and this door was standing open.  Across the yard the thread still ran along the ground, until it brought  her to a door in the wall which opened upon the Mountainside.  When she  had passed through, the thread rose to about half her height, and she  could hold it with ease as she walked.  It led her straight up the  mountain.    The cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed.  The  cook's great black cat, pursued by the housekeeper's terrier, had  bounced against her bedroom door, which had not been properly fastened,  and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle  royal.  How the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery, but I  suspect the old lady had something to do with it.    It was a clear warm morning.  The wind blew deliciously over the  Mountainside.  Here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not  stop to call upon them.  The sky was mottled with small clouds.    The sun was not yet up, but some of their fluffy edges had caught his  light, and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air.  The  dew lay in round drops upon the leaves, and hung like tiny diamond  ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path.    'How lovely that bit of gossamer is!' thought the princess, looking at  a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the  hill.  It was not the time for gossamers though; and Irene soon  discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in  the light of the morning.  It was leading her she knew not whither; but  she had never in her life been out before sunrise, and everything was  so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming, that she  felt too happy to be afraid of anything.    After leading her up a good distance, the thread turned to the left,  and down the path upon which she and Lootie had met Curdie. But she  never thought of that, for now in the morning light, with its far  outlook over the country, no path could have been more open and airy  and cheerful.  She could see the road almost to the horizon, along  which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come  shining, with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them; and it was  like a companion to her.  Down and down the path went, then up, and  then down and then up again, getting rugged and more rugged as it went;  and still along the path went the silvery thread, and still along the  thread went Irene's little rosy-tipped forefinger.  By and by she came  to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill, and up the  side of the stream went both path and thread.  And still the path grew  rougher and steeper, and the mountain grew wilder, till Irene began to  think she was going a very long way from home; and when she turned to  look back she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough  bare mountain had closed in about her.  But still on went the thread,  and on went the princess.  Everything around her was getting brighter  and brighter as the sun came nearer; till at length his first rays all  at once alighted on the top of a rock before her, like some golden  creature fresh from the sky.  Then she saw that the little stream ran  out of a hole in that rock, that the path did not go past the rock, and  that the thread was leading her straight up to it.  A shudder ran  through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was  actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran.  It ran  out babbling joyously, but she had to go in.    She did not hesitate.  Right into the hole she went, which was high  enough to let her walk without stooping.  For a little way there was a  brown glimmer, but at the first turn it all but ceased, and before she  had gone many paces she was in total darkness.  Then she began to be  frightened indeed.  Every moment she kept feeling the thread backwards  and forwards, and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of  the great hollow mountain, she kept thinking more and more about her  grandmother, and all that she had said to her, and how kind she had  been, and how beautiful she was, and all about her lovely room, and the  fire of roses, and the great lamp that sent its light through stone  walls.  And she became more and more sure that the thread could not  have gone there of itself, and that her grandmother must have sent it.  But it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep, and  especially When she came to places where she had to go down rough  stairs, and even sometimes a ladder.  Through one narrow passage after  another, over lumps of rock and sand and clay, the thread guided her,  until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep.  Finding  no change on the other side, 'Shall I ever get back?' she thought, over  and over again, wondering at herself that she was not ten times more  frightened, and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story  of a dream.  Sometimes she heard the noise of water, a dull gurgling  inside the rock.  By and by she heard the sounds of blows, which came  nearer and nearer; but again they grew duller, and almost died away.  In a hundred directions she turned, obedient to the guiding thread.    At last she spied a dull red shine, and came up to the mica window, and  thence away and round about, and right, into a cavern, where glowed the  red embers of a fire.  Here the thread began to rise. It rose as high  as her head and higher still.  What should she do if she lost her hold?  She was pulling it down: She might break it! She could see it far up,  glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers.    But presently she came to a huge heap of stones, piled in a slope  against the wall of the cavern.  On these she climbed, and soon  recovered the level of the thread only however to find, the next  moment, that it vanished through the heap of stones, and left her  standing on it, with her face to the solid rock.  For one terrible  moment she felt as if her grandmother had forsaken her.  The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#18)"],[1,"ss, there a basket of crockery, glass, and china; here a  dismantled stove, with the fire yet burning in it, there a clothes-horse,  still covered with clean clothes ironed that morning. A heap of wearing  apparel, taken out of some cupboard, lay close beside one of the  stove-pipes. All round the house were trophies of household furniture,  just as they had been carried out--the baby's cradle full of books from  the drawing-room table, china vases underneath a heap of dinner plates,  and rolls of plans from the office, blown into every corner of the fences.  And all the time the house blazed on. Then the fire spread, and ran up  the hill at the back, burning the old ice-house and a large tree, which  fell to the ground with a crash the moment after the roof fell in. At the  same moment a stock of cartridges exploded, and a volley of musketry  formed the fitting finale to our fire.    The poor children, who had hitherto been wonderfully good and patient,  now became so nervous and frightened that we could scarcely pacify them.  Our old friend, the contractor's superintendent, coming back to his  shanty shortly after the disaster, with his usual unselfish kindness  insisted on giving it up to us, and going himself into a wretched lean-to  behind the store, until the house could be rebuilt. It would be difficult  to describe the discomfort of the next few days.    Mrs. C---- came home immediately, and we were all busy sorting out the  salvage, retaining what was necessary to furnish the shanty, and storing  the remainder in a log-house used as a workshop. How we raked amongst the  still hot embers in the hope of picking up a relic, or with regretful  interest traced the shape of some favourite object in the ashes! As my  room was the first burned, I saved nothing but a few clothes, most of  which were comparatively useless, silk dresses and a log shanty not being  harmonious combinations. All my books, pictures, jewellery, and those  odds and ends which, though of little money value, had grown priceless to  me from association, were destroyed; and my desk also, containing my  notes of dates and places, so that in these pages I have had to trust  entirely to memory.    In dry weather the shanty we now occupied was a very tolerable one, built  of rough logs, their crevices filled with mud both inside and out; the  roof was of logs also, but cut in halves, scooped out, and ingeniously  interlaced--thus, [Illustration], to allow the water to run off. During  the cold weather these logs had been filled with moss, and when the  spring rains began the water settled in places, rotted them, and came  through.    The shanty was divided into three by a partition reaching half-way to the  roof. In the first room stood one bunk bed filled with straw, in the  second were two narrow ones, so close together that two people could not  get out of bed at the same time. One small window, halfway between each  room, gave light to both. There was no door into the outer room, only a  vacant space in the partition. In the centre was an iron stove set in a  box of sand. There were two narrow windows on each side, and the only  door led into the outer world. When we had made it as comfortable as we  could, the outer room had to be telegraph office (the instrument keeping  up such a continual ticking that we blessed an odd day when the wire was  down) as well as dining-room. The big table filled up half the width of  the room, and the sideboard a quarter, leaving the remainder for the  sofa, small tables--under which were stored boxes and trunks of various  sizes--safe, and chairs. We covered the walls with pictures, nails  whereon to hang everything that would hang, and small shelves. The  matting saved from the hall covered what was otherwise unoccupied of the  shanty floor. In fine weather it was not at all unpleasant, as the  children and I almost lived out of doors, and even when in the shanty  kept our hats on, ready to go out again the moment our office was called  on the line; as it was impossible to impress children, aged two and five  years respectively, with the fact that their merry chatter and a  telegraphic message in course of transition were incompatible.    In wet weather, cooped up as we were, with the roof dripping in a dozen  places, their number increasing after every storm; with all our tin pans  called into requisition to catch the falling drops, and the children  feeling it a duty they owed to society to empty their contents on the  floor the moment our backs were turned; with the instrument at work, and  the current bad, I was often made desperate by the utter impossibility of  keeping the children quiet. Rolling them in a shawl, I would rush out to  a tent pitched about ten feet from the shanty door, and used as a  kitchen, rather than endure any longer the strain upon my nerves in the  shanty. This kitchen-tent had a few rough, heavy planks for floor, and a  stove at one end, with the pipe up through the canvas, and the ridge pole  and uprights studded with nails, whereon hung cups, jugs, pans, and tins.  Two tables stood under the slanting roof, with rows of nails beneath to  hold irons and everything else with a handle. There was a small cupboard  in one corner, and the others were filled with boxes, barrels, and the  maid's trunk. The tent had been used as a cook-house so often that it was  perforated by small holes made by flying sparks, and to touch the canvas  with one's head was to invoke a shower-bath. Soaking in wet weather and  broiling in fine, it was anything but a paradise of cooks, yet it was  wonderful how well the maid managed in it, and how neat and tidy she kept  it.    We were always intensely interested in the blasting of the cutting about  three hundred feet from us. At the sound of the horn we were on the watch  to see the men ran off behind the rock. Then the smoke curled up, and the  report followed, sending the flying stones well into the air, and in a  second we could hear them rattle down all round us, on the roof of the  shanty and far out into the lake. Hearing the horn one day when quite  five hundred feet from the cutting, I turned to watch, believing myself  at a safe distance; and as I saw the stones falling, and thought it a  heavier charge than usual, I heard the hiss of one fast approaching.  Before I could decide whether to run or not it whizzed past--so close to  my ear that I could feel the wind it made--and buried itself in the sand  not two feet behind me; while another fell within a few inches of my feet  in front. Snatching the child who was with me up in my arms, I took care  to get some distance further up the hill before the next charge exploded.    One of the engineers told me he had seen stones thrown thirteen hundred  feet from a cutting. They use nitro-glycerine, and have had several  serious accidents while handling it. One poor lad who was carrying a can  weighing fifty pounds up the dump, tripped, and was blown to atoms; part  of one foot, stuck in the fork of a tree about a hundred feet off, being  all that was found of him. A man lost his sight and one arm from merely  striking a rock where some of the horrid stuff had been spilt. Often have  I watched the long train of packers coming down the hill, each with a can  of glycerine on his back, and wondered how they dared carry it over the  rough roads, knowing that one false step would cost them their lives.  Once when I was out with the children, the dogs barked furiously at one  of these poor men. Calling them off, I seized the opportunity to make  some remark about his load. \"Ay, miss!\" he said, sadly and bitterly;  \"'tis a main mean load fur any man to ha' to carry.\" Yet, in spite of the  danger and the many accidents, I have heard these packers chaffing each  other when passing. \"It's a warm day,\" says one. \"That's so; but maybe  ye'll be warmer 'fore ye're to camp tonight,\" is the reply. \"That's so.  D'ye want any word taken to the divil?\" Then again, \"Where are ye bound  for, Jack?\" \"To h---, I guess.\" \"Take the other train, and keep a berth  for me, man!\" \"Is it ye're coffin ye're carryin', Pat?\" asks another.  \"Faith, ye're right, an a coroner's inquest into the bargain, Jim!\" Yet  the wretched expression of these very men proved that they felt the  bitterness of death to be in their jests.

A few weeks after the fire, the C----s had another loss, in the sudden  death of two cows. No cause could be assigned for it; unless there might  have been poison in the wild hay which they ate, put there by the Indians  to kill the foxes. The difficulty of supplying their place on the line in  the spring made the loss considerable, especially with children in the  house, and no fresh meat attainable.    Carrière had been so completely laid up with rheumatism that he had  resigned his post, giving place for our old friend Cahill, who  immediately undertook the charge of the garden, which he said he  understood thoroughly. Looking one day into the hot-beds, which he seemed  to have taken much pride in, I found he had filled more than half the  space with different varieties of onions, and another part with carraway  seeds! When I asked why he put them in there, he said--    \"Shure, ye couldn't have anything betther nor inions. Many's the thousand  I've raised in Ireland, when I was with Kurnel Kitchener in Limerick.\"    After the cress had gone to seed, Mrs. C---- told him, to take it out,  and sow other things in its place. A little while afterwards, I saw the  old fellow transplanting something very carefully, which proved upon  investigation to be the cress. When I told him it was not worth the  trouble, he looked up and said, in a very indignant tone--  "]]]
