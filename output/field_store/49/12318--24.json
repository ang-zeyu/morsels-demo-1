To dream of buckles, foretells that you will be beset with invitations to  places of pleasure, and your affairs will be in danger of chaotic confusion.    _Buffalo_.    If a woman dreams that she kills a lot of buffaloes, she will  undertake a stupendous enterprise, but by enforcing will power  and leaving off material pleasures, she will win commendation  from men, and may receive long wished for favors.  Buffalo, seen in  a dream, augurs obstinate and powerful but stupid enemies.  They will boldly declare against you but by diplomacy you  will escape much misfortune.    _Bugle_.    To hear joyous blasts from a bugle, prepare for some unusual happiness,  as a harmony of good things for you is being formed by unseen powers.

It usually denotes gain.    _Bulldog_.[27]    To dream of entering strange premises and have a bulldog attack you,  you will be in danger of transgressing the laws of your country by using  perjury to obtain your desires.

Accidents may happen to the careless after this dream.    _Burial_.[29]    To attend the burial of a relative, if the sun is shining  on the procession, is a sign of the good health of relations,  and perhaps the happy marriage of some one of them is about to occur.  But if rain and dismal weather prevails, sickness and bad news  of the absent will soon come, and depressions in business circles  will be felt    A burial where there are sad rites performed, or sorrowing faces,  is indicative of adverse surroundings or their speedy approach.

His mother told him to try her with bread half baked, that is, midway  between hard crust and soft dough.    So, having packed his lunch, and much excited, though this time with  bright hopes, Gwyn went to bed, though not to sleep. At dawn, he was  up again and out by the lake side, with his half baked bread in his  hand.    It was a day of rain and shine, of sun burst and cloud, but no lady  appeared.    The long hours, of watching and waiting, sped on, until it was nearly  dark.    When just about to turn homewards, to ease his mother's anxiety, what  should he see, but some cows walking on the surface of the water! In a  few minutes, the lady herself, lovelier than ever, rose up and moved  towards the shore.    Gwyn rushed out to meet her, with beseeching looks and holding the  half baked bread in his hand. This time, she graciously took the gift,  placed her other hand in his, and he led her to the shore.    Standing with her on land, he could not speak for many seconds. He  noticed that she had sandals on her feet, and the one on the right  foot was tied in a way rather unusual. Under her winsome smile, at  last, he regained the use of his tongue. Then he burst out:    \"Lady I love you, more than all the world besides. Will you be my  wife?\"    She did not seem at all willing at first, but love begets love.  Finally yielding to his pleadings, she said, rather solemnly:    \"I will be your bride but only on this condition, that if you strike  me three times, without cause, I will leave your house and you only  will be to blame, and it will be forever.\"    These words stuck in his mind, and he inwardly made a vow never to  give his lovely wife cause to leave him.    But not yet did happiness come, for, even while he took oath that he  would rather cut off his right hand, than offend her, she darted away  like an arrow, and, diving in the lake, disappeared.    At this sudden blow to his hopes and joy, Gwyn was so sorely  depressed, as to wish to take his own life. Rushing up to the top of a  rock, overhanging the deepest part of the lake, he was just about to  leap into the water and drown himself, when he heard a voice behind  him, saying:    \"Hold rash lad, come here!\"    He looked and there down on the shore of the lake, stood a grand  looking old man, with a long white beard. On either side of him was a  lovely maiden. These were his daughters.    Trembling with fear, the lad slipped down from the rock and drew near.  Then the old man spoke comfortably to him, though in a very cracked  voice.    \"Mortal, do you wish to marry one of my daughters? Show me the one you  love more than the other, and I will consent.\"    Now the two maidens were so beautiful, yet so exactly alike, that Gwyn  could not note any difference. As he looked, he began to wonder  whether it had been a different lady, in each case, that rose out of  the water. He looked beyond the old man, to see if there were a third  lady. When he saw none more, he became more distracted. He feared lest  he might choose the wrong one, who had not promised to love him.    Almost in despair, he was about to run home, when he noticed that one  of the maidens put forward her right foot. Then he saw that her sandal  was tied in the way he had already wondered at. So he boldly went  forward and took her by the hand.    \"This one is mine,\" said he to the father.    \"You are right,\" answered the old man. \"This is my daughter Nelferch.  Take her and you shall have as many cattle, sheep, horses, hogs, and  goats, as she can count, of each, without drawing in her breath. But I  warn you that three blows, without cause, will send her back to me.\"    While the old man smiled, and Gwyn renewed his vow, the new wife began  to count by fives--one, two, three, four, five.    At the end of each count drawing in a fresh breath, there rose up, out  of the lake, as many sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, and horses, as she  had counted.    So it happened that the lad, who went out of his mother's cottage, in  the morning, a poor boy, came back to her, a rich man, and leading by  the hand the loveliest creature on whom man or woman had ever looked  upon.    As for the old man and the other daughter, no one ever saw them again.    Gwyn and his wife went out to a farm which he bought, and oh, how  happy they were! She was very kind to the poor. She had the gift of  healing, knew all the herbs, which were good for medicine, and cured  sick folk of their diseases.    Three times the cradle was filled, and each time with a baby boy.  Eight long and happy years followed. They loved each other so dearly  and were so happy together, that Gwyn's vow passed entirely out of his  mind, and he thought no more of it.    On the seventh birthday of the oldest boy, there was a wedding at some  distance away, and the father and mother walked through a field where  their horses were grazing. As it was too far for Lady Nelferch to walk  all the way, her husband went back to the house, for saddle and  bridle, while she should catch the horse.    \"Please do, and bring me my gloves from off the table,\" she called, as  he turned towards the house.    But when he returned to the field, he saw that she had not stirred.  So, before handing his wife her gloves and pointing playfully to the  horses, he gave her a little flick with the gloves.    Instead of moving, instantly, she heaved a deep sigh. Then looking up  at him with sorrowful and reproachful eyes, she said:    \"Remember our vow, Gwyn. This is the first causeless blow. May there  never be another.\"    Days and years passed away so happily, that the husband and father  never again had to recall the promise given to his wife and her  father.    But when they were invited to the christening of a baby, every one was  full of smiles and gayety, except Nelferch. Women, especially the  older ones, often cry at a wedding, but why his wife should burst into  tears puzzled Gwyn.    Tapping her on the shoulder, he asked the reason:    \"Because,\" said she, \"this weak babe will be in pain and misery all  its days and die in agony. And, husband dear, you have once again  struck me a causeless blow. Oh, do be on your guard, and not again  break your promise.\"    From this time forth, Gwyn was on watch over himself, day and night,  like a sentinel over whom hangs the sentence of death, should he fall  asleep on duty. He was ever vigilant lest, he, in a moment of  forgetfulness, might, by some slip of conduct, or in a moment of  forgetfulness, strike his dear wife.    The baby, whose life of pain and death of agony Nelferch had foretold,  soon passed away; for, happily, its life was short. Then she and her  husband attended the last rites of sorrow, for Celtic folk always have  a funeral and hold a wake, even when a baby, only a span long, lies in  the coffin.    Yet in the most solemn moment of the services of burial, Nelferch the  wife, laughed out, so long and with such merriment, that everyone was  startled.    Her husband, mortified at such improper behavior, touched her gently,  saying:    \"Hush, wife! Why do you laugh?\"    \"Because the babe is free from all pain. And, you have thrice struck  me! Farewell!\"    Fleeing like a deer home to their farm, she called together, by its  name, each and every one of their animals, from stable and field; yes,  even those harnessed to the plow. Then, over the mountain all moved in  procession to the lake.    There, they plunged in and vanished. No trace of them was left, except  that made by the oxen drawing the plow, and which mark on the ground  men still point out.    Broken hearted and mad with grief, Gwyn rushed into the lake and was  seen no more. The three sons, grieving over their drowned father,  spent their many days wandering along the lakeside, hoping once more  to see one, or both, of their dear parents.    Their love was rewarded. They never saw their father again, but one  day their mother, Nelferch, suddenly appeared out of the water.  Telling her children that her mission on earth was to relieve pain and  misery, she took them to a point in the lake, where many plants grew  that were useful in medicine. There, she often came and taught them  the virtues of the roots, leaves, juices and the various virtues of  the herbs, and how to nurse the sick and heal those who had diseases.    All three of Nelferch's sons became physicians of fame and power.  Their descendants, during many centuries, were renowned for their  skill in easing pain and saving life. To this day, Physicians' Point  is shown to visitors as a famous spot, and in tradition is almost  holy.          XVIII      THE KING'S FOOT HOLDER      There was a curious custom in the far olden times of Wales. At the  banqueting hall, the king of the country would sit with his feet in  the lap of a high officer.    Whenever His Majesty sat down to dinner, this official person would be  under the table holding the royal feet. This was also the case while  all sat around the evening fire in the middle of the hall. This  footholding person was one of the king's staff and every castle must  have a human footstool as part of its furniture.    By and by, it became the fashion for pretty maidens to seek this task,  or to be chosen for the office. Their names in English sounded like  Foot-Ease, Orthopede, or Foot Lights. When she was a plump and petite  maid, they nicknamed her Twelve Inches, or when unusually soothing in  her caresses of the soft royal toes. It was considered a high honor to  be the King's Foot Holder. In after centuries, it was often boasted of  that such and such an ancestor had held this honorable service.    One picture of castle life, as given in one of the old books tells how  Kaim, the king's officer, went to the mead cellar with a golden cup,  to get a drink that would keep them all wide awake. He also brought a  handful of skewers on which they"]]]
