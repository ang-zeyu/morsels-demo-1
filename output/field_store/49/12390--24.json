It is  very far to the place where your people live.\"    \"I am here,\" replied Scarface, \"to die. Far away, in my country, is a  beautiful girl. I want to marry her, but she belongs to the Sun. So I  started to find him and ask for her. I have travelled many days. My food is  gone. I cannot go back. I cannot cross this big water, so I am going to  die.\"    \"No,\" said the swans; \"it shall not be so. Across this water is the home of  that Above Person. Get on our backs, and we will take you there.\"    Scarface quickly arose. He felt strong again. He waded out into the water  and lay down on the swans' backs, and they started off. Very deep and black  is that fearful water. Strange people live there, mighty animals which  often seize and drown a person. The swans carried him safely, and took him  to the other side. Here was a broad hard trail leading back from the  water's edge.    \"_Kyi_\" said the swans. \"You are now close to the Sun's lodge. Follow that  trail, and you will soon see it.\"      III    Scarface started up the trail, and pretty soon he came to some beautiful  things, lying in it. There was a war shirt, a shield, and a bow and  arrows. He had never seen such pretty weapons; but he did not touch  them. He walked carefully around them, and travelled on. A little way  further on, he met a young man, the handsomest person he had ever seen. His  hair was very long, and he wore clothing made of strange skins. His  moccasins were sewn with bright colored feathers. The young man said to  him, \"Did you see some weapons lying on the trail?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Scarface; \"I saw them.\"    \"But did you not touch them?\" asked the young man.    \"No; I thought some one had left them there, so I did not take them.\"    \"You are not a thief,\" said the young man. \"What is your name?\"    \"Scarface.\"    \"Where are you going?\"    \"To the Sun.\"    \"My name,\" said the young man, \"is A-pi-su'-ahts[1]. The Sun is my father;  come, I will take you to our lodge. My father is not now at home, but he  will come in at night.\"    [Footnote 1: Early Riser, i.e. The Morning Star.]    Soon they came to the lodge. It was very large and handsome; strange  medicine animals were painted on it. Behind, on a tripod, were strange  weapons and beautiful clothes--the Sun's. Scarface was ashamed to go in,  but Morning Star said, \"Do not be afraid, my friend; we are glad you have  come.\"    They entered. One person was sitting there, Ko-ko-mik'-e-is[2], the Sun's  wife, Morning Star's mother. She spoke to Scarface kindly, and gave him  something to eat. \"Why have you come so far from your people?\" she asked.    [Footnote 2: Night red light, the Moon.]    Then Scarface told her about the beautiful girl he wanted to marry. \"She  belongs to the Sun,\" he said. \"I have come to ask him for her.\"    When it was time for the Sun to come home, the Moon hid Scarface under a  pile of robes. As soon as the Sun got to the doorway, he stopped, and said,  \"I smell a person.\"    \"Yes, father,\" said Morning Star; \"a good young man has come to see you. I  know he is good, for he found some of my things on the trail and did not  touch them.\"    Then Scarface came out from under the robes, and the Sun entered and sat  down. \"I am glad you have come to our lodge,\" he said. \"Stay with us as  long as you think best. My son is lonesome sometimes; be his friend.\"    The next day the Moon called Scarface out of the lodge, and said to him:  \"Go with Morning Star where you please, but never hunt near that big water;  do not let him go there. It is the home of great birds which have long  sharp bills; they kill people. I have had many sons, but these birds have  killed them all. Morning Star is the only one left.\"    So Scarface stayed there a long time and hunted with Morning Star. One day  they came near the water, and saw the big birds.    \"Come,\" said Morning Star; \"let us go and kill those birds.\"    \"No, no!\" replied Scarface; \"we must not go there. Those are very terrible  birds; they will kill us.\"    Morning Star would not listen. He ran towards the water, and Scarface  followed. He knew that he must kill the birds and save the boy. If not, the  Sun would be angry and might kill him. He ran ahead and met the birds,  which were coming towards him to fight, and killed every one of them with  his spear: not one was left. Then the young men cut off their heads, and  carried them home. Morning Star's mother was glad when they told her what  they had done, and showed her the birds' heads. She cried, and called  Scarface \"my son.\" When the Sun came home at night, she told him about it,  and he too was glad. \"My son,\" he said to Scarface, \"I will not forget what  you have this day done for me. Tell me now, what can I do for you?\"    \"_Hai'-yu_\" replied Scarface. \"_Hai'-yu_, pity me. I am here to ask you for  that girl. I want to marry her. I asked her, and she was glad; but she says  you own her, that you told her not to marry.\"    \"What you say is true,\" said the Sun. \"I have watched the days, so I know  it. Now, then, I give her to you; she is yours. I am glad she has been  wise. I know she has never done wrong. The Sun pities good women. They  shall live a long time. So shall their husbands and children. Now you will  soon go home. Let me tell you something. Be wise and listen: I am the only  chief. Everything is mine. I made the earth, the mountains, prairies,  rivers, and forests. I made the people and all the animals. This is why I  say I alone am the chief. I can never die. True, the winter makes me old  and weak, but every summer I grow young again.\"    Then said the Sun: \"What one of all animals is smartest? The raven is, for  he always finds food. He is never hungry. Which one of all the animals is  most _Nat-o'-ye_[1]? The buffalo is. Of all animals, I like him best. He  is for the people. He is your food and your shelter. What part of his body  is sacred? The tongue is. That is mine. What else is sacred? Berries  are. They are mine too. Come with me and see the world.\" He took Scarface  to the edge of the sky, and they looked down and saw it. It is round and  flat, and all around the edge is the jumping-off place [or walls straight  down]. Then said the Sun: \"When any man is sick or in danger, his wife may  promise to build me a lodge, if he recovers. If the woman is pure and true,  then I will be pleased and help the man. But if she is bad, if she lies,  then I will be angry. You shall build the lodge like the world, round, with  walls, but first you must build a sweat house of a hundred sticks. It shall  be like the sky [a hemisphere], and half of it shall be painted red. That  is me. The other half you will paint black. That is the night.\"    [Footnote 1: This word may be translated as \"of the Sun,\" \"having Sun  power,\" or more properly, something sacred.]    Further said the Sun: \"Which is the best, the heart or the brain? The brain  is. The heart often lies, the brain never.\" Then he told Scarface  everything about making the Medicine Lodge, and when he had finished, he  rubbed a powerful medicine on his face, and the scar disappeared. Then he  gave him two raven feathers, saying: \"These are the sign for the girl, that  I give her to you. They must always be worn by the husband of the woman who  builds a Medicine Lodge.\"    The young man was now ready to return home. Morning Star and the Sun gave  him many beautiful presents. The Moon cried and kissed him, and called him  \"my son.\" Then the Sun showed him the short trail. It was the Wolf Road  (Milky Way). He followed it, and soon reached the ground.      IV    It was a very hot day. All the lodge skins were raised, and the people sat  in the shade. There was a chief, a very generous man, and all day long  people kept coming to his lodge to feast and smoke with him. Early in the  morning this chief saw a person sitting out on a butte near by, close  wrapped in his robe. The chief's friends came and went, the sun reached the  middle, and passed on, down towards the mountains. Still this person did  not move. When it was almost night, the chief said: \"Why does that person  sit there so long? The heat has been strong, but he has never eaten nor  drunk. He may be a stranger; go and ask him in.\"    So some young men went up to him, and said: \"Why do you sit here in the  great heat all day? Come to the shade of the lodges. The chief asks you to  feast with him.\"    Then the person arose and threw off his robe, and they were surprised. He  wore beautiful clothes. His bow, shield, and other weapons were of strange  make. But they knew his face, although the scar was gone, and they ran  ahead, shouting, \"The scarface poor young man has come. He is poor no  longer. The scar on his face is gone.\"    All the people rushed out to see him. \"Where have you been?\" they  asked. \"Where did you get all these pretty things?\" He did not  answer. There in the crowd stood that young woman; and taking the two raven  feathers from his head, he gave them to her, and said: \"The trail was very  long, and I nearly died, but by those Helpers, I found his lodge. He is  glad. He sends these feathers to you. They are the sign.\"    Great was her gladness then. They were married, and made the first Medicine  Lodge, as the Sun had said. The Sun was glad. He gave them great age. They  were never sick. When they were very old, one morning, their children said:  \"Awake! Rise and eat.\" They did not move. In the night, in sleep, without  pain, their shadows had departed for the Sand Hills.        ORIGIN OF THE I-KUN-UH'-KAH-TSI[1]      I    THE BULL BAND    [Footnote 1: An account of the _I-kun-uh'-kah-tsi_, with a list of its  different bands or societies and their duties, will be found in the chapter  on Social Organization.]    The people had built a great pis'kun, very high and strong, so that no  buffalo could escape; but somehow the buffalo would not jump over the  cliff. When driven toward it, they would run nearly to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#19)"],[1,"elf-sacrifice; and they could  not think the Saviour who had said to those he had called and sent out  to preach in his name: 'Lo! I am with you always,' would desert them  among strangers. After uniting in family prayer he sought a sanctuary in  an old barn, and there committed their case to God;--his wife met her  Savior in her closet and poured out her heart before him there.    \"That morning a young married farmer, a mile or two away, was going with  a number of hands to his mowing-field. But as he afterward told the  minister, he was obliged to stop short. He told his hired help to go on,  but he _must go back_--_he must go and carry provisions to the  minister's house_. He returned to the house, and telling his wife how he  felt, asked her help in putting up the things he must carry. He  harnessed his horse into his wagon; put up a bushel of potatoes, meat,  flour, sugar, butter, etc. He was not a professor of religion. The  minister's wife told me there was a good wagon-load. He drove it to the  house, and found that his gifts were most thankfully received. This  account was received from the minister himself,--David P.--, who died in  Chelsea, Mass., in Dec. 1875, and subsequently from his wife,--and  communicated to a correspondent of '_The Christian_.'\"      \"GOD'S RAVEN.\"      \"A lady who lived on the north side of London, set out one day to see a  poor sick friend, living in Drury Lane, and took with her a basket  provided with tea, butter, and food. The day was fine and clear when she  started; but as she drew near Islington a thick fog came on, and  somewhat frightened her, as she was deaf, and feared it might be  dangerous in the streets if she could not see. Thicker and darker the  fog became; they lighted the lamps, and the omnibus went at a walking  pace. She might have got into another omnibus and returned; but a strong  feeling which she could not explain made her go on. When they reached  the Strand they could see nothing. At last the omnibus stopped, and the  conductor guided her to the foot-path. As she was groping her way along,  the fog cleared up, just at the entrance to Drury Lane, and even the  blue sky was seen. She now easily found the narrow court, rang the  number 5 bell, and climbed to the fifth story. She knocked at the door,  and a little girl opened it.    \"'How is grandmother?'    \"'Come in, Mrs. A----,' answered the grandmother. 'How did you get here?  We have been in thick darkness all day.'    \"The room was exceedingly neat, and the kettle stood boiling on a small  clear fire. Everything was in perfect order; on the table stood a little  tea-tray ready for use. The sick woman was in bed, and her daughter sat  working in a corner of the room.    \"'I see you are ready for tea,' said the lady; 'I have brought something  more to place upon the table.'    \"With clasped hands the woman breathed a few words of thanksgiving  first, and then said, 'O, Mrs. A----, you are indeed God's raven, sent  by him to bring us food to-day, for we have not tasted any yet. I felt  sure he would care for us.'    \"'But you have the kettle ready for tea?'    \"'Yes, ma'am,' said the daughter; 'mother would have me set it on the  fire; and when I said, 'What is the use of doing so? you know we have  nothing in the house,' she still would have it, and said, 'My child, God  will provide. Thirty years he has already provided for me, through all  my pain and helplessness, and he will not leave me to starve at last: he  will send us help, though we do not yet see how.' In this expectation  mother has been waiting all day, quite sure that some one would come and  supply our need. But we did not think of the possibility of your coming  from such a distance on such a day. Indeed, it must be God who sent you  to us.'    \"'The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of  all their troubles.'\"      HOW THE STOLEN SLEIGH WAS RETURNED BY A THIEF.      The widow of a minister of the Gospel sends to \"_The Christian_\" the  following instance illustrating God's faithfulness in hearing and  answering prayer:    \"About the year 1829, my husband, who died January 2d, 1854, lent his  sleigh and harness to a man calling himself John Cotton, to go some  twenty miles and be gone three days. Cotton was quite a stranger among  us, having been in our place but six weeks. During that time he had  boarded with my husband's brother, working for him a part of the time,  and the rest of the time selling wooden clocks, of which he had bought a  number. Three days passed, but he did not return. The fourth went by,  and we began to think he had absconded. On inquiry, Mr. P. found that  the clocks had been purchased on credit, and all sold for watches or  money; that Cotton owed sixty dollars toward his horse, and had borrowed  of the brother with whom he boarded, horse-blanket, whip, and mittens.  Now it seemed sure that he was a rogue, but what could be done? Pursuit  was useless after such a lapse of time.    \"My husband felt his loss severely, for we had little property then, and  what we had was the product of hard labor. But he was a Christian, and,  I believe, always made his business a subject of prayer.    \"About three weeks passed away. One evening, having been out longer than  usual, he came in, and, with his characteristic calmness, said: 'I shall  not worry any more about my sleigh and harness, I think I shall get them  again.' 'Why do you think so?' His answer was: 'I have been praying to  God to arrest Cotton's conscience, so that he will be obliged to _leave  them where I can get them_, and I believe he will do it.'    \"From this time, which was Wednesday evening, he seemed at rest on the  subject. The next Tuesday morning, as he stepped into the post-office, a  letter was handed him from Littleton, N.H. It was written by the keeper  of a public house, and read thus:         \"'_Mr. P.--Sir, Mr. John Cotton has left your sleigh and       harness here, and you can have them by calling for them_.                                                     Yours, etc., J--N       N----N.'    \"He returned home with the letter, and started for L----; went there the  same day, some forty miles; found sleigh and harness safe, with no  encumbrance. The landlord informed him that, a few nights before, at  twelve o'clock, a man calling himself John Cotton came to his house,  calling for horse-baiting and supper; would not stay till morning, but  wished to leave the sleigh and harness for Mr. S.--- P.--- of  Marshfield, Vt. He said he could not write himself; and requested the  landlord to write for him, saying he took them on a poor debt for Mr.  P., in one of the towns below! He started off at two o'clock at night,  on horseback, with an old pair of saddle-bags and a horse blanket, on a  saddle with one stirrup and no crupper, on one of the coldest nights of  that or any other year. He took the road leading through the Notch in  the mountains, left nothing for either of those he owed, and we have  never since heard from him.\"      \"NONE OF THE LORD'S CHILDREN LEFT DESOLATE.\"      \"_The Christian Era_ tells of a Dutch preacher who held a meeting one  evening in a strange city. While he was preaching, and enforcing upon  the hearts of his hearers the doctrine of the Cross, a police officer  came into the room and forbade him to go on. He even commanded him to  leave the city. As he was a stranger in the place, and the night was  dark, he wandered around the city gates. He was not, however, without  consolation; for he remembered Him who had said, 'Lo, I am with you  always. I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy  staff, they comfort me.'    \"He had long been in the school of Christ, and had learned to watch for  the slightest intimations of His will. While he was thus wandering  around, suddenly he saw a light in the distance. 'See,' he said to  himself, 'perhaps the Lord has provided me a shelter there,' and, in the  simplicity of faith, he directed his steps thither. On arriving, he  heard a voice in the house; and, as he drew nearer, he discovered that a  man was praying. Joyful, he hoped, that he had found here the home of a  brother. He stood still for a moment, and heard these words, poured  forth from an earnest heart: 'Lord Jesus, one of thy persecuted servants  may, perhaps, be wandering, at this moment, in a strange place of which  he knows nothing. O, may he find my home, that he may receive here food  and lodging.'    \"The preacher, having heard these words, glided into the house, as soon  as the speaker said, 'Amen.' Both fell on their knees, and together  thanked the Lord, who is a hearer of prayer, and who never leaves nor  forsakes His servants.\"      THE NEW COAT THAT FITTED EXACTLY.      \"A few years since, a young preacher in the State of Massachusetts, who  was laboring in a field which yielded no great pecuniary returns, had  laid aside the sum of fifteen dollars from his scanty income, with which  to purchase himself a coat, of which he stood in need. Before he had  time to obtain it, there was presented to him a certain charitable  object which seemed to demand a portion of his little store. After some  consideration as to whether it was his duty to give as much as the ten  dollars, which first presented itself to his mind as the proper sum to  bestow, he concluded to follow his convictions, and thus assist one who  was more needy than himself, and trust in the Lord to provide the coat.    \"Within two or three days afterwards, he was visiting at the house of  his mother, in another town, and she, as mothers will, noticed that his  coat had arrived at that condition which usually affords the preacher of  the Gospel evidence that he is shortly to have a new one, and she made  some remarks about its worn appearance, saying, 'It seems to me you need  a new coat.' 'I know it,' he replied, 'and I shall get me one as soon as  I get the means.' She said, 'There is a coat up stairs"]]]
