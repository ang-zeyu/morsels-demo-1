The other movement was the revolution in Spain's colonies in the  Western Hemisphere, a movement that cost Spain all of its possessions in  that area, with the exception of Cuba and Porto Rico. The influence of the  revolutionary activities naturally extended to Cuba, but it was not until  after 1820 that matters became dangerously critical. From that time until  the present, the question of Cuba's political fate, and the question of our  relations with the island, form an interesting and highly important chapter  in the history of the United States as well as in the history of Cuba.    In his book on the war with Spain, Henry Cabot Lodge makes a statement that  may seem curious to some and amazing to others. It is, however, the opinion  of a competent and thoroughly trained student of history. He writes thus:    \"The expulsion of Spain from the Antilles is merely the last and final step  of the inexorable movement in which the United States has been engaged for  nearly a century. By influence and by example, or more directly, by arms  and by the pressure of ever-advancing settlements, the United States drove  Spain from all her continental possessions in the Western Hemisphere, until  nothing was left to the successors of Charles and Philip but Cuba and Porto  Rico. How did it happen that this great movement stopped when it came to  the ocean's edge? The movement against Spain was at once national  and organic, while the pause on the sea-coast was artificial and in  contravention of the laws of political evolution in the Americas. The  conditions in Cuba and Porto Rico did not differ from those which had gone  down in ruin wherever the flag of Spain waved on the mainland. The Cubans  desired freedom, and Bolivar would fain have gone to their aid. Mexico and  Colombia, in 1825, planned to invade the island, and at that time invasion  was sure to be successful. What power stayed the oncoming tide which had  swept over a continent? Not Cuban loyalty, for the expression 'Faithful  Cuba' was a lie from the beginning. The power which prevented the  liberation of Cuba was the United States, and more than seventy years later  this republic has had to fight a war because at the appointed time she set  herself against her own teachings, and brought to a halt the movement she  had herself started to free the New World from the oppression of the Old.  The United States held back Mexico and Colombia and Bolivar, used  her influence at home and abroad to that end, and, in the opinion of  contemporary mankind, succeeded, according to her desires, in keeping Cuba  under the dominion of Spain.\"    For a number of years, Cuba's destiny was a subject of the gravest concern  in Washington. Four solutions presented themselves; first, the acquisition  of Cuba by the United States; second, its retention by Spain; third,  its transfer to some power other than Spain; fourth, its political  independence. That the issue was decided by the United States is shown by  all the history of the time. While other factors had their influence in the  determination, it is entirely clear that the issue turned on the question  of slavery. In his book on _Cuba and International Relations_, Mr. Callahan  summarizes his review of the official proceedings by saying that \"the South  did not want to see Cuba independent _without_ slavery, while the North did  not want to annex it _with_ slavery.\" In his work on the _Rise and Fall of  the Slave Power in America_, Mr. Henry Wilson declares that \"thus clearly  and unequivocally did this Republic step forth the champion of slavery, and  boldly insist that these islands should remain under the hateful despotism  of Spain, rather than gain their independence by means that should inure to  the detriment of its cherished system. Indeed, it (the United States) would  fight to fasten more securely the double bondage on Cuba and the slave.\"    From this point of view, unquestionably correct, it is altogether evident  that the United States assumed responsibility for Cuba's welfare, not by  the intervention of 1898, but by its acts more than seventy years earlier.  The diplomatic records of those years are filled with communications  regarding the island, and it was again and again the subject of legislation  or proposed legislation. President after President dealt with it in  messages to Congress. The acquisition of the island, by purchase or  otherwise, was again and again discussed. Popular interest was again and  again excited; the Spanish colonial policy was denounced; and the burdens  and sufferings of the Cubans were depicted in many harrowing tales. For the  policy that led to the imposition of a restraining hand on proposals to  free Cuba, in those early days, the people of the United States today must  blush. The independence movement in the States of Spanish-America may be  said to have had its definite beginning in 1806, when Francisco Miranda,  a Venezuelan, sailed from New York with three ships manned by American  filibusters, although the first land battle was fought in Bolivia, in 1809,  and the last was fought in the same country, in 1825. But the great wave  swept from the northern border of Mexico to the southernmost point of  Spanish possession. When these States declared their independence, they  wrote into their Constitutions that all men should be free, that human  slavery should be abolished forever from their soil. The attitude of the  United States in the matter of Cuba was determined by the objection to the  existence of an anti-slavery State so near our border. The experience of  Haiti and Santo Domingo was, of course, clearly in mind, but the objection  went deeper than that. Those who are interested may read with profit the  debates in the Congress of the United States, in 1826, on the subject of  the despatch of delegates to the so-called Panama Congress-of that year. On  the whole, it is not pleasant reading from any present point of view.    Our cherished Monroe Doctrine was one of the fruits of this period, and in  the enunciation of that policy the affairs of Cuba were a prominent if not  the dominant force. The language of this doctrine is said to have been  written by Secretary Adams, but it is embodied in the message of President  Monroe, in December, 1823, and so bears his name. In April, of that year,  Secretary Adams sent a long communication to Mr. Nelson, then the American  Minister to Spain. For their bearing on the Cuban question, and for the  presentation of a view that runs through many years of American policy,  extracts from that letter may be included here.      DEPARTMENT OF STATE,    WASHINGTON, April 28, 1823.    \"In the war between France and Spain, now commencing, other interests,  peculiarly ours, will, in all probability, be deeply involved. Whatever may  be the issue of this war, as between these two European powers, it may be  taken for granted that the dominion of Spain upon the American continent,  north and south, is irrecoverably gone. But the islands of Cuba and Porto  Rico still remain nominally, and so far really, dependent upon her, that  she possesses the power of transferring her own dominion over them,  together with the possession of them, to others. These islands, from their  local position are natural appendages to the North American continent,  and one of them, Cuba, almost in sight of our shores, from a multitude of  considerations, has become an object of transcendant importance to the  commercial and political interests of our Union. Its commanding position,  with reference to the Gulf of Mexico and the West India seas; the character  of its population; its situation midway between our southern coast and  the island of St. Domingo; its safe and capacious harbor of the Havana,  fronting a long line of our shores destitute of the same advantage; the  nature of its productions and of its wants, furnishing the supplies and  needing the returns of a commerce immensely profitable and mutually  beneficial,--give it an importance in the sum of our national interests  with which that of no other foreign territory can be compared, and little  inferior to that which binds the different members of this Union together.  Such, indeed, are the interests of that island and of this country, the  geographical, commercial, moral, and political relations, that, in looking  forward to the probable course of events, for the short period of half  a century, it is scarcely possible to resist the conviction that the  annexation of Cuba to our federal republic will be indispensable to the  continuance and integrity of the Union itself.\"    The communication proceeds to relate the knowledge of the Department that  both Great Britain and France were desirous of securing possession and  control of the island, and to disclaim, on the part of the United States,  all disposition to obtain possession of either Cuba or Porto Rico.  The complications of the situation became increasingly serious, more  particularly with regard to Cuba, and on December 2, of that year (1823),  President Monroe issued his message carrying the \"doctrine,\" which may be  given thus:    \"In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we  have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy to do so.  It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent  injuries or make preparations for our defense. With the movements in this  hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected. We owe it,  therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the  United States and those powers (of Europe) to declare that we should  consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion  of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.

This is the particular town where the Lord-Warden  of the Stannaries always holds his famous Parliament of miners, and for  stamping of tin.  The town is well built, but shows that it has been much  fuller, both of houses and inhabitants, than it is now; nor will it  probably ever rise while the town of Falmouth stands where it does, and  while the trade is settled in it as it is.  There are at least three  churches in it, but no Dissenters' meeting-house that I could hear of.    Tregony is upon the same water north-east from Falmouth--distance about  fifteen miles from it--but is a town of very little trade; nor, indeed,  have any of the towns, so far within the shore, notwithstanding the  benefit of the water, any considerable trade but what is carried on under  the merchants of Falmouth or Truro.  The chief thing that is to be said  of this town is that it sends members to Parliament, as does also  Grampound, a market-town; and Burro', about four miles farther up the  water.  This place, indeed, has a claim to antiquity, and is an appendix  to the Duchy of Cornwall, of which it holds at a fee farm rent and pays  to the Prince of Wales as duke 10 pounds 11s. 1d. per annum.  It has no  parish church, but only a chapel-of-ease to an adjacent parish.    Penryn is up the same branch of the Avon as Falmouth, but stands four  miles higher towards the west; yet ships come to it of as great a size as  can come to Truro itself.  It is a very pleasant, agreeable town, and for  that reason has many merchants in it, who would perhaps otherwise live at  Falmouth.  The chief commerce of these towns, as to their sea-affairs, is  the pilchards and Newfoundland fishing, which is very profitable to them  all.  It had formerly a conventual church, with a chantry and a religious  house (a cell to Kirton); but they are all demolished, and scarce the  ruins of them distinguishable enough to know one part from another.    Quitting Falmouth Haven from Penryn West, we came to Helston, about seven  miles, and stands upon the little River Cober, which, however, admits the  sea so into its bosom as to make a tolerable good harbour for ships a  little below the town.  It is the fifth town allowed for the coining tin,  and several of the ships called tin-ships are laden here.    This town is large and populous, and has four spacious streets, a  handsome church, and a good trade.  This town also sends members to  Parliament.  Beyond this is a market-town, though of no resort for trade,  called Market Jew.  It lies, indeed, on the seaside, but has no harbour  or safe road for shipping.    At Helford is a small but good harbour between Falmouth and this port,  where many times the tin-ships go in to load for London; also here are a  good number of fishing vessels for the pilchard trade, and abundance of  skilful fishermen.  It was from this town that in the great storm which  happened November 27, 1703, a ship laden with tin was blown out to sea  and driven to the Isle of Wight in seven hours, having on board only one  man and two boys.  The story is as follows:--    \"The beginning of the storm there lay a ship laden with tin in Helford  Haven, about two leagues and a half west of Falmouth.  The tin was taken  on board at a place called Guague Wharf, five or six miles up the river,  and the vessel was come down to Helford in order to pursue her voyage to  London.    \"About eight o'clock in the evening the commander, whose name was Anthony  Jenkins, went on board with his mate to see that everything was safe, and  to give orders, but went both on shore again, leaving only a man and two  boys on board, not apprehending any danger, they being in safe harbour.  However, he ordered them that if it should blow hard they should carry  out the small bower anchor, and so to moor the ship by two anchors, and  then giving what other orders he thought to be needful, he went ashore,  as above.    \"About nine o'clock, the wind beginning to blow harder, they carried out  the anchor, according to the master's order; but the wind increasing  about ten, the ship began to drive, so they carried out their best bower,  which, having a good new cable, brought the ship up.  The storm still  increasing, they let go the kedge anchor; so that they then rode by four  anchors ahead, which were all they had.    \"But between eleven and twelve o'clock the wind came about west and by  south, and blew in so violent and terrible a manner that, though they  rode under the lee of a high shore, yet the ship was driven from all her  anchors, and about midnight drove quite out of the harbour (the opening  of the harbour lying due east and west) into the open sea, the men having  neither anchor or cable or boat to help themselves.    \"In this dreadful condition (they driving, I say, out of the harbour)  their first and chief care was to go clear of the rocks which lie on  either side the harbour's mouth, and which they performed pretty well.  Then, seeing no remedy, they consulted what to do next.  They could carry  no sail at first--no, not a knot; nor do anything but run away afore it.  The only thing they had to think on was to keep her out at sea as far as  they could, for fear of a point of land called the Dead Man's Head, which  lies to the eastward of Falmouth Haven; and then, if they could escape  the land, thought to run in for Plymouth next morning, so, if possible,  to save their lives.    \"In this frighted condition they drove away at a prodigious rate, having  sometimes the bonnet of their foresail a little out, but the yard lowered  almost to the deck--sometimes the ship almost under water, and sometimes  above, keeping still in the offing, for fear of the land, till they might  see daylight.  But when the day broke they found they were to think no  more of Plymouth, for they were far enough beyond it; and the first land  they made was Peverel Point, being the southernmost land of the Isle of  Purbeck, in Dorsetshire, and a little to the westward of the Isle of  Wight; so that now they were in a terrible consternation, and driving  still at a prodigious rate.  By seven o'clock they found themselves  broadside of the Isle of Wight.    \"Here they consulted again what to do to save their lives.  One of the  boys was for running her into the Downs; but the man objected that,  having no anchor or cable nor boat to go on shore with, and the storm  blowing off shore in the Downs, they should be inevitably blown off and  lost upon the unfortunate Goodwin--which, it seems, the man had been on  once before and narrowly escaped.    \"Now came the last consultation for their lives.  The other of the boys  said he had been in a certain creek in the Isle of Wight, where, between  the rocks, he knew there was room to run the ship in, and at least to  save their lives, and that he saw the place just that moment; so he  desired the man to let him have the helm, and he would do his best and  venture it.  The man gave him the helm, and he stood directly in among  the rocks, the people standing on the shore thinking they were mad, and  that they would in a few minutes be dashed in a thousand pieces.    \"But when they came nearer, and the people found they steered as if they  knew the place, they made signals to them to direct them as well as they  could, and the young bold fellow run her into a small cove, where she  stuck fast, as it were, between the rocks on both sides, there being but  just room enough for the breadth of the ship.  The ship indeed, giving  two or three knocks, staved and sunk, but the man and the two youths  jumped ashore and were safe; and the lading, being tin, was afterwards  secured.    \"N.B.--The merchants very well rewarded the three sailors, especially the  lad that ran her into that place.\"    Penzance is the farthest town of any note west, being 254 miles from  London, and within about ten miles of the promontory called the Land's  End; so that this promontory is from London 264 miles, or thereabouts.  This town of Penzance is a place of good business, well built and  populous, has a good trade, and a great many ships belonging to it,  notwithstanding it is so remote.  Here are also a great many good  families of gentlemen, though in this utmost angle of the nation; and,  which is yet more strange, the veins of lead, tin, and copper ore are  said to be seen even to the utmost extent of land at low-water mark, and  in the very sea--so rich, so valuable, a treasure is contained in these  parts of Great Britain, though they are supposed to be so poor, because  so very remote from London, which is the centre of our wealth.    Between this town and St. Burien, a town midway between it and the Land's  End, stands a circle of great stones, not unlike those at Stonehenge, in  Wiltshire, with one bigger than the rest in the middle.  They stand about  twelve feet asunder, but have no inscription; neither does tradition  offer to leave any part of their history upon record, as whether it was a  trophy or a monument of burial, or an altar for worship, or what else; so  that all that can be learned of them is that here they are.  The parish  where they stand is called Boscawone, from whence the ancient and  honourable family of Boscawen derive their names.    Near Penzance, but open to the sea, is that gulf they call Mount's Bay;  named so from a high hill standing in the water, which they call St.  Michael's Mount: the seamen call it only the Cornish Mount.  It has been  fortified, though the situation of it makes it so difficult of access  that, like the Bass in Scotland, there needs no fortification; like the  Bass, too, it was once made a prison for prisoners of State, but now it  is wholly neglected.  There is a very good road here for shipping, which  makes the town of Penzance be a place of good resort.    A little up in the county towards the north-west is Godolchan,"]]]
