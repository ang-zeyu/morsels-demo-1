The thatched roofs speedily were in flames, and as the wind was blowing  from the river dense clouds of smoke rolled down upon the assailants. It  was now only the intervals between the houses which had to be defended,  and for an hour the stubborn resistance continued, the Royalist troops  defending each house with its inclosure to the last, and firing them as  they retreated, their own loss being trifling in comparison with that  which they inflicted upon their assailants.    At last the whole of the defenders were gathered in and round the mill.  This was defended from attack by the mill stream, which separated it  from the village, and which was crossed only by the road leading down to  the ford. The bridge was a wooden one, and this had been already partly  sawn away. As soon as the last of the defenders crossed the remainder of  the bridge was chopped down. Along the line of the stream Harry had  erected a defense, breast high, of sacks of wheat from the mill. The  enemy, as they straggled out through the burning village, paused, on  seeing the strong position which yet remained to be carried. The mill  stream was rapid and deep, and the approaches swept by the fire from the  mill. There was a pause, and then the cannon were brought up and fire  opened upon the mill, the musketry keeping up an incessant rattle from  every wall and clump of bushes.    The mill was built of wood, and the cannon shot went through and through  it. But Harry directed his men to place rows of sacks along each floor  facing the enemy, and lying down behind these to fire through holes  pierced in the planks. For half an hour the cannonade continued, and  then the enemy were seen advancing, carrying beams and the trunks of  small trees, to make a bridge across the stream. Had Harry's men been  armed with muskets it would have been next to impossible for the enemy  to succeed in doing this in the face of their fire. But the fire of  their short weapons was wild and uncertain, except at short distances.  Very many of the Roundheads fell, but others pressed forward bravely,  and succeeded in throwing their beams across the stream. By this time  Harry had led out all his force from the mill, and a desperate fight  took place at the bridge. The enemy lined the opposite bank in such  force that none of the defenders could show their heads above the  barricade of sacks, and Harry came to the conclusion that further  resistance was vain. He ordered Jacob to take all the men with the  exception of ten and to retire at once across the ford. He himself with  the remainder would defend the bridge till they were fairly across, and  would then rush over and join them as he might.    With a heavy heart Jacob was preparing to obey this order, when he heard  a loud cheer, and saw Prince Rupert, heading a large body of horse, dash  into the river on the other side. The enemy saw him too. There was an  instant cessation of their fire, and before Prince Rupert had gained  the bank the Roundheads were already in full retreat for Reading. The  bridge was hastily repaired, and the prince pursued for some distance,  chasing their cavalry well-nigh into Reading. Their infantry, however,  held together, and regained that town in safety.    Upon his return Prince Rupert expressed his warm admiration at the  prolonged and gallant defense which Harry had made, and said that the  oldest soldier in the army could not have done better. At Harry's  request he promised the villagers that the next day money should be sent  out from the king's treasury to make good the losses which they had  sustained. Then he left a strong body of horse to hold the village, and  directed Harry to ride with him with his troop to Oxford.    \"I have a mission for you, Master Furness,\" he said, as they rode along.  \"I have already told his majesty how coolly and courageously you  conducted yourself in that sore strait in which we were placed together.  The king has need of a messenger to Scotland. The mission is a difficult  one, and full of danger. It demands coolness and judgment as well as  courage. I have told his majesty that, in spite of your youth, you  possess these qualities, but the king was inclined to doubt whether you  were old enough to be intrusted with such a commission. After to-day's  doings he need have no further hesitation. I spoke to your father but  yesterday, and he has given consent that you shall go, the more readily,  methinks, because the good Cavalier thinks that the morals and ways of  many of our young officers to be in no wise edifying for you, and I  cannot but say that he is right. What sayest thou?\"    Harry expressed his willingness to undertake any mission with which he  might be charged. He thought it probable that no great movements would  be undertaken in the south for some time, and with a lad's natural love  of adventure, was pleased at the thought of change and variety.    The Scots were at this time arranging for a close alliance with the  Parliament, which had sent emissaries to Edinburgh to negotiate a Solemn  League and Covenant. Sir Henry Vane, who was an Independent, had been  forced to accede to the demand of the Scotch Parliament, that the  Presbyterian religious system of Scotland should be adopted as that of  England, and after much chaffering for terms on both sides, the document  was signed, and was to bind those who subscribed it to endeavor, without  respect of persons, to extirpate popery and prelacy.    On the 25th of September, nearly a week after the battle of Newbury, all  the members of Parliament still remaining in London assembled in St.  Margaret's Church, and signed the Solemn League and Covenant; but even  at this moment of enthusiasm the parties were not true to each other.  The Scotch expected that Presbyterianism would be introduced into  England, and that Episcopacy would be entirely abolished. The English  members, however, signed the declaration with the full intent of  preserving their own religion, that of a form of Episcopacy, altered  much indeed from that of the Church of England, but still differing  widely from the Scotch system.    The king had many adherents in Scotland, chief of whom was the Earl of  Montrose, a most gallant and loyal nobleman.    Upon the day after the fight in the village the king, on Prince Rupert's  recommendation, appointed Harry Furness to bear dispatches to the earl,  and as he was going north, Prince Rupert placed Lady Sidmouth and her  daughter under his charge to convey to the army of the Earl of  Newcastle, under whom her husband was at this time engaged.    Upon asking what force he should take with him the prince said that he  had better proceed with his own troop, as an escort to the ladies, as  far as the camp of Newcastle, filling up the places of those who had  fallen in the skirmishes and fight of Newbury with other men, so as to  preserve his full tale of fifty troopers. When he had fulfilled the  first part of his mission he was to place his troop at the earl's  service until his return, and to proceed in such manner and disguise as  might seem best to him.    Harry started for the north in high spirits, feeling very proud of the  charge confided to him. Lady Sidmouth and her daughter were placed in a  light litter between two horses. Harry took his place beside it. Half  the troop, under the command of the lieutenant, rode in front; the other  half followed. So they started for the north. It was a long journey, as  they were forced to avoid many towns occupied by Roundheads. Upon the  fourth day of their journey they suddenly heard the explosion of  pistols, and the shouts of men in conflict. Harry ordered his lieutenant  to ride forward with half the troop to some rising ground just in front,  and there they saw a combat going on between a party of Cavaliers and a  force of Roundheads, much superior to them in numbers. Harry joined the  lieutenant, and sending back a man with orders to the remaining half of  the troop to form a guard round the litter, he headed the advance party,  and the twenty-five men rode headlong down into the scene of conflict.  It was a sharp fight for a few minutes, and then the accession of  strength which the Cavaliers had gained gave them the superiority, and  the Roundheads fell back, but in good order.    \"You arrived just in time, sir,\" the leader of the party engaged said.  \"I am Master John Chillingworth, and am marching to Hardley House, which  the Puritans are about to besiege. There is no time to delay, for see  you not on yonder hill the gleam of pikes? That is the enemy's footmen.  It is only an advanced party of their horse with which we have had this  affair. You cannot go forward in this direction. There is a strong body  of Roundheads lying a few miles to the north.\"    Harry rode back to Lady Sidmouth, and after a consultation with her and  with Master Chillingworth, they decided to throw themselves into Hardley  House, where the addition of strength which they brought might enable  them to beat off the Roundheads, and then to proceed on their way. They  learned indeed from a peasant that several bodies of Roundheads were  advancing from various directions, and that Hardley House was strong and  well defended. Of the choice of evils, therefore, they thought this to  be the lightest, and, after an hour's hard riding, they arrived before  its walls. It was an old castellated building, with bastions and walls  capable of standing a siege. The party were gladly received by the  master, Sir Francis Burdett, who had placed his castle in a posture of  defense, but was short of men. Upon the news of the approach of the  enemy he had hastily driven a number of cattle into the yard, and had  stores of provisions sufficient to stand a siege for some time.    In a short time the Parliament force, consisting of five hundred footmen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1159"],[0,"Fire-Tongue (#19)"],[1,"\"I agree,\" said Wessex. \"He had got into a tight corner somewhere right  enough. But where does Nicol Brinn come in?\"    \"How did he receive your communication?\"    \"Oh, it took him fairly between the eyes. There is no denying that. He  knows something.\"    \"What he knows,\" said Innes, slowly, \"is what Mr. Harley learned last  night, and what he fears is what has actually befallen the chief.\"    Detective Inspector Wessex stood beside the Burmese cabinet, restlessly  drumming his fingers upon its lacquered surface. \"I am grateful for one  thing,\" he said. \"The press has not got hold of this story.\"    \"They need never get hold of it if you are moderately careful.\"    \"For several reasons I am going to be more than moderately careful.  Whatever Fire-Tongue may be, its other name is sudden death! It's a  devil of a business; a perfect nightmare. But--\" he paused--    \"I am wondering what on earth induced Mr. Harley to send that parcel of  linen to the analyst.\"    \"The result of the analysis may prove that the chief was not engaged  upon any wild-goose chase.\"    \"By heavens!\" Wessex sprang up, his eyes brightened, and he reached for  his hat, \"that gives me an idea!\"    \"The message with the parcel was written upon paper bearing the  letterhead of the late Sir Charles Abingdon. So Mr. Harley evidently  made his first call there! I'm off, sir! The trail starts from that  house!\"    Leaving Innes seated at the big table with an expression of despair  upon his face, Detective Inspector Wessex set out. He blamed himself for  wasting time upon the obvious, for concentrating too closely upon the  clue given by Harley's last words to Innes before leaving the office  in Chancery Lane. It was poor workmanship. He had hoped to take a short  cut, and it had proved, as usual, to be a long one. Now, as he sat in a  laggard cab feeling that every minute wasted might be a matter of life  and death, he suddenly became conscious of personal anxiety. He was a  courageous, indeed a fearless, man, and he was subconsciously surprised  to find himself repeating the words of Nicol Brinn: \"Be careful--be very  careful!\" With all the ardour of the professional, he longed to find a  clue which should lead him to the heart of the mystery.    Innes had frankly outlined the whole of Paul Harley's case to date, and  Detective Inspector Wessex, although he had not admitted the fact, had  nevertheless recognized that from start to finish the thing did not  offer one single line of inquiry which he would have been capable of  following up. That Paul Harley had found material to work upon, had  somehow picked up a definite clue from this cloudy maze, earned the  envious admiration of the Scotland Yard man.    Arrived at his destination, he asked to see Miss Abingdon, and was shown  by the butler into a charmingly furnished little sitting room which  was deeply impressed with the personality of its dainty owner. It was  essentially and delightfully feminine. Yet in the decorations and in the  arrangement of the furniture there was a note of independence which was  almost a note of defiance. Phyllis Abingdon, an appealingly pathetic  figure in her black dress, rose to greet the inspector.    \"Don't be alarmed, Miss Abingdon,\" he said, kindly. \"My visit does not  concern you personally in any way, but I thought perhaps you might be  able to help me trace Mr. Paul Harley.\"    Wessex had thus expressed himself with the best intentions, but even  before the words were fully spoken he realized with a sort of shock that  he could not well have made a worse opening. Phil Abingdon's eyes seemed  to grow alarmingly large. She stood quite still, twisting his card  between her supple fingers.    \"Mr. Harley!\" she whispered.    \"I did not want to alarm you,\" said the detective, guiltily, \"but--\" He  stopped, at a loss for words.    \"Has something happened to him?\"    \"I am sorry if I have alarmed you,\" he assured her, \"but there is some  doubt respecting Mr. Harley's present whereabouts. Have you any idea  where he went when he left this house yesterday?\"    \"Yes, yes. I know where he went, quite well.\"    \"Benson, the butler, told me all about it when I came in.\" Phil Abingdon  spoke excitedly, and took a step nearer Wessex. \"He went to call upon  Jones, our late parlourmaid.\"    \"Late parlourmaid?\" echoed Wessex, uncomprehendingly.    \"Yes. He seemed to think he had made a discovery of importance.\"    \"Something to do with a parcel which he sent away from here to the  analyst?\"    \"Yes! I have been wondering whatever it could be. In fact, I rang up  his office this morning, but learned that he was out. It was a serviette  which he took away. Did you know that?\"    \"I did know it, Miss Abingdon. I called upon the analyst. I understand  you were out when Mr. Harley came. May I ask who interviewed him?\"    \"He saw Benson and Mrs. Howett, the housekeeper.\"    \"May I also see them?\"    \"Yes, with pleasure. But please tell me\"--Phil Abingdon looked up at him  pleadingly--\"do you think something--something dreadful has happened to  Mr. Harley?\"    \"Don't alarm yourself unduly,\" said Wessex. \"I hope before the day is  over to be in touch with him.\"    As a matter of fact, he had no such hope. It was a lie intended to  console the girl, to whom the news of Harley's disappearance seemed to  have come as a terrible blow. More and more Wessex found himself to be  groping in the dark. And when, in response to the ringing of the bell,  Benson came in and repeated what had taken place on the previous day,  the detective's state of mystification grew even more profound. As a  matter of routine rather than with any hope of learning anything useful,  he interviewed Mrs. Howett; but the statement of the voluble old lady  gave no clue which Wessex could perceive to possess the slightest value.    Both witnesses having been dismissed, he turned again to Phil Abingdon,  who had been sitting watching him with a pathetic light of hope in her  eyes throughout his examination of the butler and Mrs. Howett.    \"The next step is clear enough,\" he said, brightly. \"I am off to South  Lambeth Road. The woman Jones is the link we are looking for.\"    \"But the link with what, Mr. Wessex?\" asked Phil Abingdon. \"What is it  all about?--what does it all mean?\"    \"The link with Mr. Paul Harley,\" replied Wessex. He moved toward the  door.    \"But won't you tell me something more before you go?\" said the girl,  beseechingly. \"I--I--feel responsible if anything has happened to Mr.  Harley. Please be frank with me. Are you afraid he is--in danger?\"    \"Well, miss,\" replied the detective, haltingly, \"he rang up his  secretary, Mr. Innes, last night--we don't know where from--and admitted  that he was in a rather tight corner. I don't believe for a moment that  he is in actual danger, but he probably has--\" again he hesitated--\"good  reasons of his own for remaining absent at present.\"    Phil Abingdon looked at him doubtingly. \"I am almost afraid to ask you,\"  she said in a low voice, \"but--if you hear anything, will you ring me  up?\"    \"I promise to do so.\"    Chartering a more promising-looking cab than that in which he had come,  Detective Inspector Wessex proceeded to 236 South Lambeth Road. He had  knocked several times before the door was opened by the woman to whom  the girl Jones had called on the occasion of Harley's visit.    \"I am a police officer,\" said the detective inspector, \"and I have  called to see a woman named Jones, formerly in the employ of Sir Charles  Abingdon.\"    \"Polly's gone,\" was the toneless reply.    \"Gone? Gone where?\"    \"She went away last night to a job in the country.\"    \"What time last night?\"    \"I can't remember the time. Just after a gentleman had called here to  see her.\"    \"Someone from the police?\"    \"I don't know. She seemed to be very frightened.\"    \"Were you present when he interviewed her?\"    \"No.\"    \"After he had gone, what did Polly do?\"    \"Sat and cried for about half an hour, then Sidney came for her.\"    \"Sidney?\"    \"Her boy--the latest one.\"    \"Describe Sidney.\"    \"A dark fellow, foreign.\"    \"French--German?\"    \"No. A sort of Indian, like.\"    \"Indian?\" snapped Wessex. \"What do you mean by Indian?\"    \"Very dark,\" replied the woman without emotion, swinging a baby she  held to and fro in a methodical way which the detective found highly  irritating.    \"You mean a native of India?\"    \"Yes, I should think so. I never noticed him much. Polly has so many.\"    \"How long has she known this man?\"    \"Only a month or so, but she is crazy about him.\"    \"And when he came last night she went away with him?\"    \"Yes. She was all ready to go before the other gentleman called. He must  have told her something which made her think it was all off, and she was  crazy with joy when Sidney turned up. She had all her things packed, and  off she went.\"    Experience had taught Detective Inspector Wessex to recognize the truth  when he met it, and he did not doubt the statement of the woman with  the baby. \"Can you give me any idea where this man Sidney came from?\" he  asked.    \"I am afraid I can't,\" replied the listless voice. \"He was in the  service of some gentleman in the country; that's all I know about him.\"    \"Did Polly leave no address to which letters were to be forwarded?\"    \"No; she said she would write.\"    \"One other point,\" said Wessex, and he looked hard into the woman's  face: \"What do you know about Fire-Tongue?\"    He was answered by a stare of blank stupidity.    \"You heard me?\"    \"Yes, I heard you, but I don't know what you are talking about.\"    Quick decisions are required from every member of the Criminal  Investigation Department, and Detective Inspector Wessex came to one  now.    \"That will do for the present,\" he said, turned, and ran down the steps  to the waiting cab.
