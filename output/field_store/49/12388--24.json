The spectrum is thus spread into a band,  having a width proportional to the time of exposure and to the rate of  the controlling clock.    This band is generally not uniformly dense. It exhibits lines  perpendicular to the refracting edge of the prism, such as are produced  in the field of an ordinary spectroscope by particles of dust upon the  slit. In the present case, these lines may be due to variations in the  transparency of the air during the time of exposure, or to instrumental  causes, such as irregular running of the driving clock, or slight  changes in the motion of the telescope, resulting from the manner in  which its polar axis is supported.    These instrumental defects may be too small to be detected in ordinary  micrometric or photographic observations, and still sufficient to affect  the photographs just described.    A method of enlargement has been tried which gives very satisfactory  results, and removes the lines above mentioned as defects in the  negatives. A cylindrical lens is placed close to the enlarging lens,  with its axis parallel to the length of the spectrum. In the apparatus  actually employed, the length of the spectrum, and with it the  dispersion, is increased five times, while the breadth is made in all  cases about four inches. The advantage of this arrangement is that it  greatly reduces the difficulty arising from the feeble light of the  star. Until very lately, the spectra in the original negatives were made  very narrow, since otherwise the intensity of the starlight would have  been insufficient to produce the proper decomposition of the silver  particles. The enlargement being made by daylight, the vast amount of  energy then available is controlled by the original negative, the action  of which may be compared to that of a telegraphic relay. The copies  therefore represent many hundred times the original energy received from  the stars. If care is not taken, the dust and irregularities of the film  will give trouble, each foreign particle appearing as a fine spectral  line.    Our methods of enlargement have been considered, and some of them tried,  with the object of removing the irregularities of the original spectra  without introducing new defects. For instance, the sensitive plate may  be moved during the enlargement in the direction of the spectral lines;  a slit parallel to the lines may be used as the source of light, and the  original negative separated by a small interval from the plate used for  the copy; or two cylindrical lenses may be used, with their axes  perpendicular to each other. In some of these ways the lines due to dust  might either be avoided or so much reduced in length as not to resemble  the true lines of the spectrum.    The 15 inch refractor is now being used with a modification of the  apparatus employed by Dr. Draper in his first experiments--a slit  spectroscope from which the slit has been removed. A concave lens has  been substituted for the collimator and slit, and besides other  advantages, a great saving in length is secured by this change. It is  proposed to apply this method to the 28 inch reflector, thus utilizing  its great power of gathering light.    [A description of an accompanying plate here follows, which is omitted,  as the plate cannot be easily reproduced for ordinary press printing.]    The results to be derived from the large number of photographs already  obtained can only be stated after a long series of measurements and a  careful reduction and discussion of them. An inspection of the plates,  however, shows some points of interest. A photograph of _a Cygni_, taken  November, 26, 1886, shows that the H line is double, its two components  having a difference in wave length of about one ten-millionth of a  millimeter. A photograph of _o Ceti_ shows that the lines G and _h_ are  bright, as are also four of the ultra-violet lines characteristic of  spectra of the first type. The H and K lines in this spectrum are dark,  showing that they probably do not belong to that series of lines. The  star near _[chi]' Orionis_, discovered by Gore, in December, 1885, gives  a similar spectrum, which affords additional evidence that it is a  variable of the same class as _o Ceti_. Spectra of _Sirius_ show a large  number of faint lines besides the well-known broad lines.    The dispersion employed in any normal map of the spectrum may be  expressed by its scale, that is, by the ratio of the wave length as  represented to the actual wave length. It will be more convenient to  divide these ratios by one million, to avoid the large numbers otherwise  involved. If one millionth of a millimeter is taken as the unit of wave  length, the length of this unit on the map in millimeters will give the  same measure of the dispersion as that just described. When the map is  not normal, the dispersion of course varies in different parts. It  increases rapidly toward the violet end when the spectrum is formed by a  prism. Accordingly, in this case the dispersion given will be that of  the point whose wave length is 400.    This point lies near the middle of the photographic spectrum when a  prism is used, and is not far from the H line. The dispersion may  accordingly be found with sufficient accuracy by measuring the interval  between the H and K lines, and dividing the result in millimeters by  3.4, since the difference in their wave lengths equals this quantity.  The following examples serve to illustrate the dispersion expressed in  this way: Angstrom, Cornu, 10; Draper, photographer of normal solar  spectrum, 3.1 and 5.2; Rowland, 23, 33, and 46; Draper, stellar spectra,  0.16; Huggins, 0.1.    The most rapid plates are needed in this work, other considerations  being generally of less importance. Accordingly, the Allen and Rowell  extra quick plates have been used until recently. It was found, however,  that they were surpassed by the Seed plates No. 21, which were  accordingly substituted for them early in December. Recognizing the  importance of supplying this demand for the most sensitive plates  possible, the Seed Company have recently succeeded in making still more  sensitive plates, which we are now using. The limit does not seem to be  reached even yet. Plates could easily be handled if the sensitiveness  were increased tenfold. A vast increase in the results may be  anticipated with each improvement of the plates in this respect.  Apparatus for testing plates, which is believed to be much more accurate  than that ordinarily employed, is in course of preparation. It is  expected that a very precise determination will be made of the rapidity  of the plates employed. Makers of very rapid plates are invited to send  specimens for trial.    The photographic work has been done by Mr. W.P. Gerrish, who has also  rendered important assistance in other parts of the investigation. He  has shown great skill in various experiments which have been tried, and  in the use of various novel and delicate instruments. Many of the  experimental difficulties could not have been overcome but for the  untiring skill and perseverance of Mr. George B. Clark, of the firm of  Alvan Clark & Sons, by whom all the large instruments have been  constructed.    The progress of the various investigations which are to form a part of  this work is given below:    1. _Catalogue of Spectra of Bright Stars_.--This is a continuation of  the work undertaken with the aid of an appropriation from the Bache  fund, and described in the Memoirs of the American Academy, vol. xi., p.  210. The 8 inch telescope is used, each photograph covering a region of  10 deg. square. The exposures for equatorial stars last for five minutes,  and the rate of the clock is such that the spectra have a width of about  0.1 cm. The length of the spectra is about 1.2 cm. for the brighter, and  0.6 cm. for the fainter stars. The dispersion of the scale proposed  above is 0.1.    The spectra of all stars of the sixth magnitude and brighter will  generally be found upon these plates, except in the case of red stars.  Many fainter blue stars also appear. Three or four exposures are made  upon a single plate. The entire sky north of -24 deg. would be covered  twice, according to this plan, with 180 plates and 690 exposures. It is  found preferable in some cases to make only two exposures; and when the  plate appears to be a poor one, the work is repeated. The number of  plates is therefore increased. Last summer the plates appeared to be  giving poor results. Dust on the prisms seemed to be the explanation of  this difficulty. Many regions were reobserved on this account. The first  cycle, covering the entire sky from zero to twenty-four hours of right  ascension, has been completed.    The work will be finished during the coming year by a second cycle of  observations, which has already been begun. The first cycle contains 257  plates, all of which have been measured, and a large part of the  reduction completed. 8,313 spectra have been measured on them, nearly  all of which have been identified, and the places of a greater portion  of the stars brought forward to the year 1900, and entered in catalogue  form. In the second cycle, 64 plates have been taken, and about as many  more will be required. 51 plates have been measured and identified,  including 2,974 spectra. A study of the photographic brightness and  distribution of the light in the spectra will also be made.    The results will be published in the form of a catalogue resembling the  Photometric Catalogue given in volume xiv. of the Annals of Harvard  College Observatory. It will contain the approximate place of each star  for 1900, its designation, the character of the spectrum as derived from  each of the plates in which it was photographed, the references to these  plates, and the photographic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#19)"],[1," and now thou  makest as if thou wouldst amend it, but a cruel and hard heart abides  behind.\"    \"Let us lay aside vain babble,\" says Brynhild. \"Long did I hold my peace  concerning my sorrow of heart, and, lo now, thy brother alone do I love;  let us fall to other talk.\"    Gudrun said, \"Far beyond all this doth thine heart look.\"    And so ugly ill befell from that going to the river, and that knowing of  the ring, wherefrom did all their talk arise.        CHAPTER XXIX. Of Brynhild's great Grief and Mourning.    After this talk Brynhild lay a-bed, and tidings were brought to King  Gunnar that Brynhild was sick; he goes to see her thereon, and asks what  ails her; but she answered him naught, but lay there as one dead: and  when he was hard on her for an answer, she said--    \"What didst thou with that ring that I gave thee, even the one which  King Budli gave me at our last parting, when thou and King Giuki came to  him and threatened fire and the sword, unless ye had me to wife? Yea, at  that time he led me apart, and asked me which I had chosen of those who  were come; but I prayed him that I might abide to ward the land and be  chief over the third part of his men; then were there two choices for me  to deal betwixt, either that I should be wedded to him whom he would, or  lose all my weal and friendship at his hands; and he said withal that  his friendship would be better to me than his wrath: then I bethought me  whether I should yield to his will, or slay many a man; and therewithal  I deemed that it would avail little to strive with him, and so it fell  out, that I promised to wed whomsoever should ride the horse Grani with  Fafnir's Hoard, and ride through my flaming fire, and slay those men  whom I called on him to slay, and now so it was, that none durst ride,  save Sigurd only, because he lacked no heart thereto; yea, and the Worm  he slew, and Regin, and five kings beside; but thou, Gunnar, durst do  naught; as pale as a dead man didst thou wax, and no king thou art,  and no champion; so whereas I made a vow unto my father, that him alone  would I love who was the noblest man alive, and that this is none save  Sigurd, lo, now have I broken my oath and brought it to naught, since  he is none of mine, and for this cause shall I compass thy death; and a  great reward of evil things have I wherewith to reward Grimhild;--never,  I wot, has woman lived eviler or of lesser heart than she.\"    Gunnar answered in such wise that few might hear him, \"Many a vile  word hast thou spoken, and an evil-hearted woman art thou, whereas thou  revilest a woman far better than thou; never would she curse her life  as thou dost; nay, nor has she tormented dead folk, or murdered any; but  lives her life well praised of all.\"    Brynhild answered, \"Never have I dwelt with evil things privily, or done  loathsome deeds;--yet most fain I am to slay thee.\"    And therewith would she slay King Gunnar, but Hogni laid her in fetters;  but then Gunnar spake withal--    \"Nay, I will not that she abide in fetters.\"    Then said she, \"Heed it not! For never again seest thou me glad in thine  hall, never drinking, never at the chess-play, never speaking the words  of kindness, never over-laying the fair cloths with gold, never giving  thee good counsel;--ah, my sorrow of heart that I might not get Sigurd  to me!\"    Then she sat up and smote her needlework, and rent it asunder, and bade  set open her bower doors, that far away might the wailings of her sorrow  be heard; then great mourning and lamentation there was, so that folk  heard it far and wide through that abode.    Now Gudrun asked her bower-maidens why they sat so joyless and downcast.  \"What has come to you, that ye fare ye as witless women, or what  unheard-of wonders have befallen you?\"    Then answered a waiting lady, hight Swaflod, \"An untimely, an evil day  it is, and our hall is fulfilled of lamentation.\"    Then spake Gudrun to one of her handmaids, \"Arise, for we have slept  long; go, wake Brynhild, and let us fall to our needlework and be  merry.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" she says, \"nowise may I wake her, or talk with her; for many  days has she drunk neither mead nor wine; surely the wrath of the Gods  has fallen upon her.\"    Then spake Gudrun to Gunnar, \"Go and see her,\" she says, \"and bid her  know that I am grieved with her grief.\"    \"Nay,\" says Gunnar, \"I am forbid to go see her or to share her weal.\"    Nevertheless he went unto her, and strives in many wise to have speech  of her, but gets no answer whatsoever; therefore he gets him gone and  finds Hogni, and bids him go see her: he said he was loth thereto, but  went, and gat no more of her.    Then they go and find Sigurd, and pray him to visit her; he answered  naught thereto, and so matters abode for that night.    But the next day, when he came home from hunting, Sigurd went to Gudrun,  and spake--    \"In such wise do matters show to me, as though great and evil things  will betide from this trouble and upheaving; and that Brynhild will  surely die.\"    Gudrun answers, \"O my lord, by great wonders is she encompassed, seven  days and seven nights has she slept, and none has dared wake her.\"    \"Nay, she sleeps not,\" said Sigurd, \"her heart is dealing rather with  dreadful intent against me.\"    Then said Gudrun, weeping, \"Woe worth the while for thy death! Go and  see her; and wot if her fury may not be abated; give her gold, and  smother up her grief and anger therewith!\"    Then Sigurd went out, and found the door of Brynhild's chamber open; he  deemed she slept, and drew the clothes from off her, and said--    \"Awake, Brynhild! The sun shineth now over all the house, and thou hast  slept enough; cast off grief from thee, and take up gladness!\"    She said, \"And how then hast thou dared to come to me? in this treason  none was worse to me than thou.\"    Said Sigurd, \"Why wilt thou not speak to folk? for what cause sorrowest  thou?\"    Brynhild answers, \"Ah, to thee will I tell of my wrath!\"    Sigurd said, \"As one under a spell art thou, if thou deemest that there  is aught cruel in my heart against thee; but thou hast him for husband  whom thou didst choose.\"    \"Ah, nay,\" she said, \"never did Gunnar ride through the fire to me, nor  did he give me to dower the host of the slain: I wondered at the man  who came into my hall; for I deemed indeed that I knew thine eyes; but I  might not see clearly, or divide the good from the evil, because of the  veil that lay heavy on my fortune.\"    Says Sigurd, \"No nobler men are there than the sons of Giuki, they slew  the king of the Danes, and that great chief, the brother of King Budli.\"    Brynhild answered, \"Surely for many an ill-deed must I reward them; mind  me not of my griefs against them! But thou, Sigurd, slewest the Worm,  and rodest the fire through; yea, and for my sake, and not one of the  sons of King Giuki.\"    Sigurd answers, \"I am not thy husband, and thou art not my wife; yet did  a farfamed king pay dower to thee.\"    Says Brynhild, \"Never looked I at Gunnar in such a wise that my heart  smiled on him; and hard and fell am I to him, though I hide it from  others.\"    \"A marvellous thing,\" says Sigurd, \"not to love such a king; what angers  thee most? for surely his love should be better to thee than gold.\"    \"This is the sorest sorrow to me,\" she said, \"that the bitter sword is  not reddened in thy blood.\"    \"Have no fear thereof!\" says he, \"no long while to wait or the bitter  sword stand deep in my heart; and no worse needest thou to pray for  thyself, for thou wilt not live when I am dead; the days of our two  lives shall be few enough from henceforth.\"    Brynhild answers, \"Enough and to spare of bale is in thy speech, since  thou bewrayedst me, and didst twin (1) me and all bliss;--naught do I  heed my life or death.\"    Sigurd answers, \"Ah, live, and love King Gunnar and me withal! and all  my wealth will I give thee if thou die not.\"    Brynhild answers, \"Thou knowest me not, nor the heart that is in me;  for thou art the first and best of all men, and I am become the most  loathsome of all women to thee.\"    \"This is truer,\" says Sigurd, \"that I loved thee better than myself,  though I fell into the wiles from whence our lives may not escape; for  whenso my own heart and mind availed me, then I sorrowed sore that thou  wert not my wife; but as I might I put my trouble from me, for in a  king's dwelling was I; and withal and in spite of all I was well content  that we were all together. Well may it be, that that shall come to pass  which is foretold; neither shall I fear the fulfilment thereof.\"    Brynhild answered, and said, \"Too late thou tellest me that my grief  grieved thee: little pity shall I find now.\"    Sigurd said, \"This my heart would, that thou and I should go into one  bed together; even so wouldst thou be my wife.\"    Said Brynhild, \"Such words may nowise be spoken, nor will I have two  kings in one hall; I will lay my life down rather than beguile Gunnar  the King.\"    And therewith she call to mind how they met, they two, on the mountain,  and swore oath each to each.    \"But now is all changed, and I will not live.\"    \"I might not call to mind thy name,\" said Sigurd, \"or know thee again,  before the time of thy wedding; the greatest of all griefs is that.\"    Then said Brynhild, \"I swore an oath to wed the man who should ride my  flaming fire, and that oath will I hold to, or die.\"    \"Rather than thou die, I will wed thee, and put away Gudrun,\" said  Sigurd.    But therewithal so swelled the heart betwixt the sides of him, that the  rings of his byrny burst asunder.    \"I will not have thee,\" says Brynhild, \"nay, nor any other!\"    Then Sigurd got him gone.    So saith the song of Sigurd--         \"Out then went Sigurd,       The great kings' well-loved,       From the speech and the sorrow,       Sore drooping, so grieving,       That the shirt round about him       Of iron rings woven,       From the sides brake "]]]
