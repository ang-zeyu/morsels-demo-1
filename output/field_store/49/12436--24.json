We must, however, as I have suggested already, distinguish  between true and forced symbolism. The early Christians employed the  fish as a symbol of Christ, because the Greek word for fish, icqus,  is obtained by _notariqon_(1) from the phrase <gr 'Ihsous Cristos Qeou  Uios, Swthr>--\"JESUS CHRIST, the Son of God, the Saviour.\" Of course,  the obvious use of such a symbol was its entire unintelligibility to  those who had not yet been instructed in the mysteries of the Christian  faith, since in the days of persecution some degree of secrecy was  necessary. But the symbol has significance only in the Greek language,  and that of an entirely arbitrary nature. There is nothing in the nature  of the fish, apart from its name in Greek, which renders it suitable  to be used as a symbol of CHRIST. Contrast this pseudo-symbol, however,  with that of the Good Shepherd, the Lamb of God (fig. 34), or the Lion  of Judah. Here we have what may be regarded as true symbols, something  of whose meanings are clear to the smallest degree of spiritual sight,  even though the second of them has frequently been badly misinterpreted.      (2a) ARTHUR H. COLLINS, M.A.: _Symbolism of Animals and Birds  represented in English Church Architecture_ (1913).    (1) A Kabalistic process by which a word is formed by taking the initial  letters of a sentence or phrase.      It was a belief in the spiritual or moral significance of nature similar  to that of the mystical expositors of the Bible, that inspired the  mediaeval naturalists. The Bestiaries almost invariably conclude the  account of each animal with the moral that might be drawn from its  behaviour. The interpretations are frequently very far-fetched, and  as the writers were more interested in the morals than in the facts  of natural history themselves, the supposed facts from which they drew  their morals were frequently very far from being of the nature of facts.  Sometimes the product of this inaccuracy is grotesque, as shown by the  following quotation: \"The elephants are in an absurd way typical of Adam  and Eve, who ate of the forbidden fruit, and also have the dragon for  their enemy. It was supposed that the elephant... used to sleep by  leaning against a tree. The hunters would come by night, and cut the  trunk through. Down he would come, roaring helplessly. None of his  friends would be able to help him, until a small elephant should come  and lever him up with his trunk. This small elephant was symbolic of  Jesus Christ, Who came in great humility to rescue the human race which  had fallen 'through a tree.' \"(1)      (1) A. H. COLLINS: _Symbolism of Animals, etc_., pp. 41 and 42.      In some cases, though the symbolism is based upon quite erroneous  notions concerning natural history, and is so far fantastic, it is not  devoid of charm. The use of the pelican to symbolise the Saviour is a  case in point. Legend tells us that when other food is unobtainable, the  pelican thrusts its bill into its breast (whence the red colour of the  bill) and feeds its young with its life-blood. Were this only a fact,  the symbol would be most appropriate. There is another and far less  charming form of the legend, though more in accord with current  perversions of Christian doctrine, according to which the pelican uses  its blood to revive its young, after having slain them through anger  aroused by the great provocation which they are supposed to give it. For  an example of the use of the pelican in church architecture see fig. 36.    Mention must also be made of the purely fabulous animals of the  Bestiaries, such as the basilisk, centaur, dragon, griffin, hydra,  mantichora, unicorn, phoenix, _etc_. The centaur (fig. 39) was a beast,  half man, half horse. It typified the flesh or carnal mind of man, and  the legend of the perpetual war between the centaur and a certain tribe  of simple savages who were said to live in trees in India, symbolised  the combat between the flesh and the spirit.(1)      (1) A H. COLLINS: _Symbolism of Animals, etc_., pp. 150 and 153.      With bow and arrow in its hands the centaur forms the astrological  sign Sagittarius (or the Archer). An interesting example of this sign  occurring in church architecture is to be found on the western doorway  of Portchester Church--a most beautiful piece of Norman architecture.  \"This sign of the Zodiac,\" writes the Rev. Canon VAUGHAN, M.A., a former  Vicar of Portchester, \"was the badge of King Stephen, and its presence  on the west front (of Portchester Church) seems to indicate, what was  often the case elsewhere, that the elaborate Norman carving was not  carried out until after the completion of the building.\"(2) The facts,  however, that this Sagittarius is accompanied on the other side of the  doorway by a couple of fishes, which form the astrological sign Pisces  (or the Fishes), and that these two signs are what are termed, in  astrological phraseology, the \"houses\" of the planet Jupiter, the  \"Major Fortune,\" suggest that the architect responsible for the design,  influenced by the astrological notions of his day, may have put the  signs there in order to attract Jupiter's beneficent influence. Or  he may have had the Sagittarius carved for the reason Canon VAUGHAN  suggests, and then, remembering how good a sign it was astrologically,  had the Pisces added to complete the effect.(1b)      (2) Rev. Canon VAUGHAN, M.A.: A Short History of Portchester Castle, p.  14.    (1b) Two other possible explanations of the Pisces have been suggested  by the Rev. A. HEADLEY. In his MS. book written in 1888, when he was  Vicar of Portchester, he writes: \"I have discovered an interesting proof  that it (the Church) was finished in Stephen's reign, namely, the figure  of Sagittarius in the Western Doorway.    \"Stephen adopted this as his badge for the double reason that it  formed part of the arms of the city of Blois, and that the sun was  in Sagittarius in December when he came to the throne. I, therefore,  conclude that this badge was placed where it is to mark the completion  of the church.    \"There is another sign of the Zodiac in the archway, apparently Pisces.  This may have been chosen to mark the month in which the church was  finished, or simply on account of its nearness to the sea. At one time  I fancied it might refer to March, the month in which Lady Day occurred,  thus referring to the Patron Saint, St Mary. As the sun leaves Pisces  just before Lady Day this does not explain it. Possibly in the old  calendar it might do so. This is a matter for further research.\" (I have  to thank the Rev. H. LAWRENCE FRY, present Vicar of Portchester, for  this quotation, and the Rev. A. HEADLEY for permission to utilise it.)      The phoenix and griffin we have encountered already in our excursions.  The latter, we are told, inhabits desert places in India, where it can  find nothing for its young to eat. It flies away to other regions  to seek food, and is sufficiently strong to carry off an ox. Thus it  symbolises the devil, who is ever anxious to carry away our souls to  the deserts of hell. Fig. 37 illustrates an example of the use of this  symbolic beast in church architecture.    The mantichora is described by PLINY (whose statements were  unquestioningly accepted by the mediaeval naturalists), on the authority  of CTESIAS (_fl_. 400 B.C.), as having \"A triple row of teeth, which fit  into each other like those of a comb, the face and ears of a man, and  azure eyes, is the colour of blood, has the body of the lion, and a tail  ending in a sting, like that of the scorpion. Its voice resembles the  union of the sound of the flute and the trumpet; it is of excessive  swiftness, and is particularly fond of human flesh.\"(1)      (1) PLINY: _Natural History_, bk. viii. chap. xxx. (BOSTOCK and RILEY'S  trans., vol. ii., 1855, p. 280.)      Concerning the unicorn, in an eighteenth-century work on natural history  we read that this is \"a Beast, which though doubted of by many Writers,  yet is by others thus described: He has but one Horn, and that an  exceedingly rich one, growing out of the middle of his Forehead. His  Head resembles an Hart's, his Feet an Elephant's, his tail a Boar's, and  the rest of his Body an Horse's. The Horn is about a Foot and half in  length. His Voice is like the Lowing of an Ox. His Mane and Hair are  of a yellowish Colour. His Horn is as hard as Iron, and as rough as any  File, twisted or curled, like a flaming Sword; very straight, sharp, and  every where black, excepting the Point. Great Virtues are attributed to  it, in expelling of Poison and curing of several Diseases. He is not  a Beast of prey.\"(2) The method of capturing the animal believed in  by mediaeval writers was a curious one. The following is a literal  translation from the _Bestiary_ of PHILIPPE DE THAUN (12th century):--    (2) (THOMAS BOREMAN): _A Description of Three Hundred Animals_ (1730),  p. 6.     \"Monosceros is an animal which has one horn on its head,   Therefore it is so named; it has the form of a goat,   It is caught by means of a virgin, now hear in what manner.   When a man intends to hunt it and to take and ensnare it   He goes to the forest where is its repair;   There he places a virgin, with her breast uncovered,   And by its smell the monosceros perceives it;   Then it comes to the virgin, and kisses her breast,   Falls asleep on her lap, and so comes to its death;   The man arrives immediately, and kills it in its sleep,   Or takes it alive and does as he likes with it.   It signifies much, I will not omit to tell it you.         \"Monosceros is Greek, it means _one horn_ in French:   A beast of such a description signifies Jesus Christ;   One God he is and shall be, and was and will continue so;   He placed himself in the virgin, and took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#19)"],[1,"thing she hath offended you, she will amend it at your  pleasure.\" To this the king replied not, although the mantle pleased him  much. With that came in the lady of the lake, and said, \"Sir, put not on  this mantle till thou hast seen more; and in nowise let it be put upon  thee, or any of thy knights, till ye have made the bringer of it first put  it on her.\" \"It shall be done as thou dost counsel,\" said the king. Then  said he to the damsel that came from his sister, \"Damsel, I would see this  mantle ye have brought me upon yourself.\" \"Sir,\" said she, \"it will not  beseem me to wear a knight's garment.\" \"By my head,\" said King Arthur,  \"thou shall wear it ere it go on any other person's back!\" And so they put  it on her by force, and forthwith the garment burst into a flame and  burned the damsel into cinders. When the king saw that, he hated that  false witch Morgan le Fay with all his heart, and evermore was deadly  quarrel between her and Arthur to their lives' end.          CHAPTER VIII    _King Arthur conquers Rome, and is crowned Emperor_      And now again the second time there came ambassadors from Lucius Tiberius,  Emperor of Rome, demanding, under pain of war, tribute and homage from  King Arthur, and the restoration of all Gaul, which he had conquered from  the tribune Flollo.    When they had delivered their message, the king bade them withdraw while  he consulted with his knights and barons what reply to send. Then some of  the younger knights would have slain the ambassadors, saying that their  speech was a rebuke to all who heard the king insulted by it. But when  King Arthur heard that, he ordered none to touch them upon pain of death;  and sending officers, he had them taken to a noble lodging, and there  entertained with the best cheer. \"And,\" said he, \"let no dainty be spared,  for the Romans are great lords; and though their message please me not,  yet must I remember mine honour.\"    Then the lords and knights of the Round Table were called on to declare  their counsel--what should be done upon this matter; and Sir Cador of  Cornwall speaking first, said, \"Sir, this message is the best news I have  heard for a long time, for we have been now idle and at rest for many  days, and I trust that thou wilt make sharp war upon the Romans, wherein,  I doubt not, we shall all gain honour.\"    \"I believe well,\" said Arthur, \"that thou art pleased, Sir Cador; but that  is scarce an answer to the Emperor of Rome, and his demand doth grieve me  sorely, for truly I will never pay him tribute; wherefore, lords, I pray  ye counsel me. Now, I have understood that Belinus and Brennius, knights  of Britain, held the Roman Empire in their hands for many days, and also  Constantine, the son of Helen, which is open evidence, not only that we  owe Rome no tribute, but that I, being descended from them, may, of right,  myself claim the empire.\"    Then said King Anguish of Scotland, \"Sir, thou oughtest of right to be  above all other kings, for in all Christendom is there not thine equal;  and I counsel thee never to obey the Romans. For when they reigned here  they grievously distressed us, and put the land to great and heavy  burdens; and here, for my part, I swear to avenge me on them when I may,  and will furnish thee with twenty thousand men-at-arms, whom I will pay  and keep, and who shall wait on thee with me, when it shall please thee.\"    Then the King of Little Britain rose and promised King Arthur thirty  thousand men; and likewise many other kings, and dukes, and barons,  promised aid--as the lord of West Wales thirty thousand men, Sir Ewaine  and his cousin thirty thousand men, and so forth; Sir Lancelot also, and  every other knight of the Round Table, promised each man a great host.    So the king, passing joyful at their courage and good will, thanked them  all heartily, and sent for the ambassadors again, to hear his answer. \"I  will,\" said he, \"that ye now go back straightway unto the Emperor your  master and tell him that I give no heed to his words, for I have conquered  all my kingdoms by the will of God and by my own right arm, and I am  strong enough to keep them, without paying tribute to any earthly  creature. But, on the other hand, I claim both tribute and submission from  himself, and also claim the sovereignty of all his empire, whereto I am  entitled by the right of my own ancestors--sometime kings of this land.  And say to him that I will shortly come to Rome, and by God's grace will  take possession of my empire and subdue all rebels. Wherefore, lastly, I  command him and all the lords of Rome that they forthwith pay me their  homage, under pain of my chastisement and wrath.\"    Then he commanded his treasurers to give the ambassadors great gifts, and  defray all their charges, and appointed Sir Cador to convey them  worshipfully out of the land.    So when they returned to Rome and came before Lucius, he was sore angry at  their words, and said, \"I thought this Arthur would have instantly obeyed  my orders and have served me as humbly as any other king; but because of  his fortune in Gaul, he hath grown insolent.\"    \"Ah, lord,\" said one of the ambassadors, \"refrain from such vain words,  for truly I and all with me were fearful at his royal majesty and angry  countenance. I fear me thou hast made a rod for thee more sharp than thou  hast counted on. He meaneth to be master of this empire; and is another  kind of man than thou supposest, and holdeth the most noble court of all  the world. We saw him on the new year's day, served at his table by nine  kings, and the noblest company of other princes, lords, and knights that  ever was in all the world; and in his person he is the most manly-seeming  man that liveth, and looketh like to conquer all the earth.\"    Then Lucius sent messengers to all the subject countries of Rome, and  brought together a mighty army, and assembled sixteen kings, and many  dukes, princes, lords, and admirals, and a wondrous great multitude of  people. Fifty giants also, born of fiends, were set around him for a  body-guard. With all that host he straightway went from Rome, and passed  beyond the mountains into Gaul, and burned the towns and ravaged all the  country of that province, in rage for its submission to King Arthur. Then  he moved on towards Little Britain.    Meanwhile, King Arthur having held a parliament at York, left the realm in  charge of Sir Badewine and Sir Constantine, and crossed the sea from  Sandwich to meet Lucius. And so soon as he was landed, he sent Sir Gawain,  Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir Bedivere to the Emperor, commanding him \"to  move swiftly and in haste out of his land, and, if not, to make himself  ready for battle, and not continue ravaging the country and slaying  harmless people.\" Anon, those noble knights attired themselves and set  forth on horseback to where they saw, in a meadow, many silken tents of  divers colours, and the Emperor's pavilion in the midst, with a golden  eagle set above it.    Then Sir Gawain and Sir Bors rode forward, leaving the other two behind  in ambush, and gave King Arthur's message. To which the Emperor replied,  \"Return, and tell your lord that I am come to conquer him and all his  land.\"    At this, Sir Gawain burned with anger, and cried out, \"I had rather than  all France that I might fight with thee alone!\"    \"And I also,\" said Sir Bors.    Then a knight named Ganius, a near cousin of the Emperor, laughed out  aloud, and said, \"Lo! how these Britons boast and are full of pride,  bragging as though they bare up all the world!\"    At these words, Sir Gawain could refrain no longer, but drew forth his  sword and with one blow shore oft Ganius' head; then with Sir Bors, he  turned his horse and rode over waters and through woods, back to the  ambush, where Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere were waiting. The Romans  followed fast behind them till the knights turned and stood, and then Sir  Bors smote the foremost of them through the body with a spear, and slew  him on the spot. Then came on Calibere, a huge Pavian, but Sir Bors  overthrew him also. And then the company of Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere  brake from their ambush and fell on the Romans, and slew and hewed them  down, and forced them to return and flee, chasing them to their tents.    But as they neared the camp, a great host more rushed forth, and turned  the battle backwards, and in the turmoil, Sir Bors and Sir Berel fell into  the Romans' hands. When Sir Gawain saw that, he drew his good sword  Galotine, and swore to see King Arthur's face no more if those two knights  were not delivered; and then, with good Sir Idrus, made so sore an  onslaught that the Romans fled and left Sir Bors and Sir Berel to their  friends. So the Britons returned in triumph to King Arthur, having slain  more than ten thousand Romans, and lost no man of worship from amongst  themselves.    When the Emperor Lucius heard of that discomfiture he arose, with all his  army, to crush King Arthur, and met him in the vale of Soissons. Then  speaking to all his host, he said, \"Sirs, I admonish you that this day ye  fight and acquit yourselves as men; and remembering how Rome is chief of  all the earth, and mistress of the universal world, suffer not these  barbarous and savage Britons to abide our onset.\" At that, the trumpets  blew so loud, that the ground trembled and shook.    Then did the rival hosts draw near each other with great shoutings; and  when they closed, no tongue can tell the fury of their smiting, and the  sore struggling, wounds, and slaughter. Then King Arthur, with his  mightiest knights, rode down into the thickest of the fight, and drew  Excalibur, and slew as lightning slays for swiftness and for force. And in  the midmost crowd he met a giant, Galapas by name, and struck off both his  legs at the knee-joints; then saying, \"Now art thou a better size to deal  with!\" smote his head off at a second blow: and the body killed six men"]]]
