Surviving months of introductory sessions with Francis Ribeiro,  I was firmly convinced that I had a role in nation  building. I started behaving my age and silently  promised to skip rum the next Saturday night. And on  moon-less nights, I stayed awake thinking about the  burden of the Fourth Estate, lying face down on my  leased estate. At the office there were daily hunting  trips, as I went on poaching for angles and words from  the alphabet forest.    In short, Herald was the 'journalism school' where I  learnt all the elementary tricks of the trade. But what  set apart this journalism school was its sense of  applied practical nightmares. None wanted you to come  up with a neat circle. If it got a reader's attention,  rhombus would do, this I learned from the Herald.    The continuous slogging on the desk, day in and day  out, soon scratched away the sheen off a 'oh-you-are a  journalist' comment and introduced me to a world of  words. This wordy world consisted of stories and  stories, each of them carrying a life of their own,  each one clamouring for attention. The more attention a  story deserved, the higher in the page it appeared. The  less attention the story received, down in the scale  you go.    My 'studies' did not end with desk itself. I did my  internship on the field as 'unofficial special stories  reporter'. The love for writing prompted me to scan the  paper for interesting news and do follow-up on these.  This in the long run gave me the rich experience of a  deskie as well as reporting, something which no  journalism school would probably offer.    But I was not prepared for all this when I applied for  the job of a sub-editor. Neither was I prepared for a  question like 'Do you know English?', when I came for  the interview. Asking a question like this to someone  who has applied for a job in an English-language daily  does seem to be a strange question. But the interviewer  was Rajan Narayan, the editor of Goa's oldest daily. I  was almost in a stupor after meeting the man whom I had  admired for over a decade. But this was an interview  and I stumbled out an answer. Thankfully, the interview  was very short and soon Rajan introduced me to the then  Deputy News Editor of Herald, Francis Ribeiro, who  after initial hiccups became my friend and mentor.  Francis Ribeiro's hand was in a crepe bandage when I  first shook hands with him: Later on I came to know  that he broke his hand in an unsuccessful attempt to  jump over a bull while riding his scooter on the road  to Saligao at night.    Not even in my nightmares had I ever seen myself  sitting in the office of the Herald happily churning  out copies or giving headlines to stories which  thousands of readers would read the next day. But this  happened on December 31, 1996. Since then, my innings  in the Herald was full of excitement. Not even one  single unnecessary off, as Francis would put it.    My tryst with the Herald began as a reader though.  Those were my school days in Don Bosco, Panjim. Coming  to think of it now, it does seem to be a strange  coincidence that I joined Don Bosco school in 1983 as a  fifth standard student, a few months before the Herald  was launched as an English-language daily.    Don Bosco is such a fine school because, as one  realised later in life, this was a school which  awakened the latent talent in every student. Here my  appetite for news (and, or course, lunch) grew day by  day. Every morning, just before classes began, snippets  of important news used to be read out over the school  loudspeakers. One fine morning, it was announced that a  newspaper has been launched in town called the Herald,  and that the front-page and sports-page of this  newspaper would be displayed daily on one of the  ground-floor notice boards. A crowd of boys used to  gather around this newspaper board during the 11 am  interval, snacking on every word. I used to be part of  this crowd. It became a ritual, to read the front-page  and sports-page of the Herald in school.    In my higher classes, one enterprising fellow used to  buy the whole newspaper and bring it to class,  inevitably triggering a mad scramble for the eight  pages. It was in my eighth standard, when one of the  then Salesian fathers, Jude Borges, who taught moral  science, brought copies of the Herald into the class  and asked us to count the number of advertisements and  the number of news items on each page. The verdict:  There was more news than advertisements. The moral that  day for us kids was: read the Herald newspaper, it  enriches your knowledge because it has got more news  than advertisements compared to the other leading  daily. Father Jude left us behind with one moral. I  felt like crying.    Meanwhile, Rajan Narayan's editorials and Stray  Thoughts rose to dizzying heights, and so did my  reading interest in the Herald. So finally when I met  the man himself, I was in a kind of daze.    Of course, the man never ceased to amaze me.    Much water has flowed under the Mandovi bridge carrying  with it the angst, dismay, despair, frustration of many  people who worked with me in the Herald into the  Arabian sea over my style of functioning. Call it what  you want, my stars, fate, karma, foolishness, anything,  but I have this knack of raising the hackles of people.  This inherent nature was actually a boon for me as it  was a kind of weeding out process through which I  landed in the company of those who mattered most.  Because, for a rookie like me, who had no formal  training in journalism, getting trained or learning the  nuances of journalism was of utmost importance. If I  need to tweak my brothers for that, a little 'mea  culpa'.    My innings in the Herald was a kaleidoscope of events  both inside and outside the news-room. But, Goa being  what it is, with sports and politics dominating the  news-pages, I kept myself out of the politics and  devoted myself to sports. Among other things, some  months after I joined, the Herald launched the  Sportswatch, the only sports supplement in Goa at that  time. Francis Ribeiro, affectionately called Choppy,  given charge to bring out the supplement every Friday,  was running short of hands. So I got an opportunity to  help in layout and editing of stories. This was really  an exiting break for me because, being a sportsman  myself, having played competitive judo, and with keen  interest in football, I naturally took to Sportswatch  like a fish to water.    My first big story was an interview with cricketer  Arjuna Ranatunga, the then captain of the Sri Lanka  team, which came to play in Goa. The highlight was not  my interview with Ranatunga but the startling  discoveries we made of some of the murky path in which  the cricketing world travels. Aravinda de Silva asked  us to speak his manager for permission to do a write up  on him. To our chagrin, we realised that his manager  was in Sri Lanka and this was an excuse by Aravinda de  Silva. This came amidst reports of some cricketeers  expecting to be paid a fee -- or extract money,  depending on how you see it -- for an interview. The  standard rate then it seems was Rs 10,000! Sunil  Gavaskar too behaved oddly with us when we asked him to  talk to us. This was much before the match-fixing  scandal broke out.    Thanks to Choppy, even though I started by helping him  out on the desk, I also got to do many stories for  Sportswatch. This taught me many lessons in writing,  meeting deadlines, and building up a nose for news. One  incident I remember is the disbanding of the Sesa Goa  football team. Somehow, Choppy got wind of this. So we  went to the Sesa management, which denied plans for any  such move. We ran a story to this effect in Sportswatch  . By the next week, things took a dramatic turn and the  news became official. The Sesa Goa football team was  indeed disbanded.    On the day when the decision was announced, both Choppy  and me did not even have time for lunch. We grabbed  some samosas and straightaway landed at the team  manager Joe Vaz's office in Miramar. Here we collided  with a collage of emotions from the coach to the  manager and the players all in a stupor. This was a  unique experience. One which provoked us to criticise  the management strongly; but journalistic ethics reined  us in. It taught me not to be emotional when dealing  with a profession.    It seems that Alvito D'Cunha, one of the dashing  forwards for East Bengal today, was one among a group  of Sesa Goa players who ditched the club midway in the  Second Division league and came back to Goa from  Bangalore during the players transfers period. Shorn of  its cream players, the team was left high and dry  without any strength, nullifying it chances of  qualifying for the Big League. Peter Lima Leitao, who  was the corporate manager for the team, is on record  saying that if Sesa Goa had qualified for the National  League, then perhaps the decision to disband the team  would have been put off.    Of course, it was not all hunky dory for me on the  Sportswatch desk. Neither could I boast that I had  become a full-fledged writer with hardly two years of  experience. When Brahmanand Shankhwalkar won the Arjuna  Award, Choppy asked to me to go to Fatorda for a  profile of this great football player. But I almost  chickened out as I did not have the guts to meet such a  famous personality like Brahmanand. Help came in the  form of Ashley do Rosario, into his second innings in  Herald by then, who offered to accompany me. In Fatorda,  I found out that some great people like Brahmanand,  who win laurels for the country and win accolades for  themselves, have no airs about themselves. This Arjuna  awardee was just an ordinary person who performed  extraordinarily. Sheer grit, determination, hard work  and humbleness were his only tools of success.

He said that way he  could hear the cannon down to Bowling Green. No, I didn't never hear any  shooting from the war myself.    \"Yes ma'am, the Confederates used to come through lots. I remember how  we used to go to the spring for water for 'em. Then we'd stand with the  buckets on our heads while they drank--drank out of a big gourd. When  the buckets was empty we'd go back to the spring for more water.    \"Once the Yankees come by the place. It was at night. They went out to  the quarters and they tried to get 'em to rise up. Told 'em to come on  in the big house and take what they wanted. Told 'em to take anything  they wanted to take, take Master's silver spoons and Miss' silk dress.  'If they don't like it, we'll shoot their brains out,' they said. Next  morning they told Master. He got scared and moved. At that time we was  living at Cloverport.    \"It was near the end of the war and we was already free, only we didn't  know it. He moved on up to Stephensport. That's on the Ohio too. He took  me and a brother of mine and another black boy. While we was there I  remember he took me to a circus. I remember how the lady--she was  dressed in pink come walking down a wire--straight on down to the  ground. She was carrying a long pole. I won't never forget that.    \"Not long afterwards I was married. We was all free then. My husband  asked my master if he could marry me. He told him 'You're a good man.  You can come and live on my farm and work for me, but you can't have  Mattie.' So we moved off to his Master's farm.    \"A little while after that his Master bought a big farm in Arkansas. He  wanted to hire as many people as he could. So we went with him. He  started out well, but the first summer he died. So everything had to be  sold. A man what come down to bid on some of the farm tools and  stock--come to the auction, he told us to come on up to Woodruff county  and work for him. We was there 7 years and he worked the farm and I took  care of myself and my babies. Then he went off and left me.    \"I went in to Cotton Plant and started working there. Finally he wrote  me and tried to get me to say we hadn't never been married. Said he  wanted to marry another woman. The white folks I worked for wouldn't let  me. I'd been married right and they wouldn't let me disgrace myself by  writing such a letter.    \"Finally I came on to Hot Springs. For a while I cooked and washed. Then  I started working for folks, regular. For 9 years, tho, I mostly washed  and ironed.    \"I came to Hot Springs on the 7th of February--I think it was 57 years  ago. You remember Miss Maud--it was just before that big hail storm. You  was here, don't you remember--that hail storm that took all the windows  out of all the houses, tore off roofs and swept dishes and table-cloths  right off the tables. Can't nobody forget that who's seen it.    \"Miss Mary, do you know Miss Julia Huggins? I worked for her a long  time. Worked for her before she went away and after she came back.  Between times I cooked for Mrs. Button (Burton--but called Button by  everyone) Housley. When Miss Julia come back she marches right down to  Mrs. Housley's and tells me she wants me to work for her again. 'Can't  get her now,' says Mrs. Housley, 'Mattie's done found out she's black.'  But anyhow I went to see her, and I went back to work for her, pretty  foxy Miss Julia was.    \"I been working for Mrs. Eisele pretty near twenty five years. Saw her  children grow up and the grand children. Lancing, he's my heart. Once  when Mr. and Mrs. Eisele went to see Mrs. Brown, Lancing's mother, they  took me with them. All the way to Watertown, Wisconsin. There wasn't any  more niggas in the town and all the children thought I was somthing to  look at. They'd come to see me and they'd bring their friends with 'em.  Once while we was there, a circus come to town. The children wanted me  to see it. Told me there was a negro boy in it. Guess they thought it  would be a treat to me to see another niggah. I told 'em, 'Law, don't  you think I see lots, lots more than I wants, everyday when I is at  home?'    \"It used to scare me. The folks would go off to a party or a show and  leave me alone with the baby. No, Miss Mary, I wasn't scared for myself.  I thought somebody might come in and kidnap that baby. No matter how  late they was I'd sit on the top step of the stairs leading  upstairs--just outside the door where Lansing was asleep. No matter what  time they come home they'd find me there. 'Why don't you go on in your  bedroom and lie down?' they'd ask me. 'No,' I'd tell 'em, 'somebody  might come in, and they would have to get that baby over my dead body.'    \"Jonnie, that's my daughter\" (Mrs. D.G. Murphy, 338 Walnut Street, a  large stucco house with well cared for lawn) \"she wants me to quit work.  I told her, 'You put that over on Mrs. Murphy--you made her quit work  and took care of her. What happened to her? She died! You're not going  to make me old.'    \"Twice she's got me to quit work. Once, she told me it was against the  law. Told me there was a law old folks couldn't work. I believed her and  I quit. Then I come on down and I asked Mr. Eisele\" (an important  business executive and prominent in civic affairs, [HW: aged 83]) \"He  rared back and he said, 'I'd like to see anybody stop me from working.'  So I come on back.    \"Another time, it was when the old age pensions come in. They tried to  stop me again. Told me I had to take it. I asked Mr. Eisele if I could  work just the same. 'No,' he says 'if you take it, you'll have to quit  work.' So I stamped my foot and I says, 'I won't take nobody's pension.'    \"The other day Jonnie called up here and she started to crying. Lots of  folks write her notes and say she's bad to let me work. Somebody told  her that they had seen me going by to work at 4 o'clock in the morning.  It wasn't no such. I asked a man when I was on the way and it was 25  minutes until 5. Besides, my clock had stopped and I couldn't tell what  time it was. Yes, Miss Mary, I does get here sort of early, but then I  like it. I just sit in the kitchen until the folks get up.    \"You see that picture over there, it's Mr. Eisele when he was 17. I'd  know that smiling face anywhere. He's always good to me. When they go  away to Florida I can go to the store and get money whenever I need it.  But it's always good to see them come back. Miss Maud says I'm sure to  go to Heaven, I'm such a good worker. No, Miss Mary, I'm not going to  quit work. Not until I get old.\"          Interviewer: Samuel S.

He was an old lawyer. I done forgot that  old white man's name. Old Tom Ash! Senator Ash--that's his name. He was  good to his slaves. He had so many niggers he didn't know them all.    \"My father's name was Alphonso Dorgens and my mother's name was Lizzie  Dorgens. Both of them dead. I don't know what her name was before she  married. My pa belonged to the Dorgens' and he married my ma. That is  how she come to be a Dorgen. Old Man Ash never did buy him. He just  visited my mother. They all was in the same neighborhood. Big  plantations. Both of them had masters that owned lots of land. I don't  know how often he visited my mother after he married her. He was over  there all the time. They were right adjoining plantations.    \"I was born in a frame house. I don't know nothin' about it no more than  that. It was j'ined to the kitchen. My mother had two rooms j'ined to  the kitchen. She was the old mistress' cook. She could come right out of  the kitchen and go on in her room.    \"My father worked on the farm. They fed the slaves meat and bread. That  is all I remember--meat and bread and potatoes. They made lots of  potatoes. They gave 'em what they raised. You could raise stuff for  yourself if you wanted to.    \"My mother took care of her children. We children was on the place there  with her. She didn't have nobody's children to take care of but us.    \"I was six years old during of the War. My ma told me my age, but I  forgot it; I never did have it put down. The only way I gits a pension,  I just tells 'em I was six years old during of the War, and they figures  out the age.
