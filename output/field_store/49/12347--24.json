In front of them, over beyond the hedge, the dusty road stretched away  across the plain; behind them the meadow lands and bright green fields  of tender young corn lay broadly in the sun, and overhead spread the  shade of the cool, rustling leaves of the beechen tree. Pleasantly to  their nostrils came the tender fragrance of the purple violets and wild  thyme that grew within the dewy moisture of the edge of the little  fountain, and pleasantly came the soft gurgle of the water. All was so  pleasant and so full of the gentle joy of the bright Maytime, that for a  long time no one of the three cared to speak, but each lay on his back,  gazing up through the trembling leaves of the trees to the bright sky  overhead.  At last, Robin, whose thoughts were not quite so busy wool-  gathering as those of the others, and who had been gazing around him now  and then, broke the silence.    \"Heyday!\" quoth he, \"yon is a gaily feathered bird, I take my vow.\"    The others looked and saw a young man walking slowly down the highway.  Gay was he, indeed, as Robin had said, and a fine figure he cut, for his  doublet was of scarlet silk and his stockings also; a handsome sword  hung by his side, the embossed leathern scabbard being picked out with  fine threads of gold; his cap was of scarlet velvet, and a broad feather  hung down behind and back of one ear. His hair was long and yellow and  curled upon his shoulders, and in his hand he bore an early rose, which  he smelled at daintily now and then.    \"By my life!\" quoth Robin Hood, laughing, \"saw ye e'er such a pretty,  mincing fellow?\"    \"Truly, his clothes have overmuch prettiness for my taste,\" quoth Arthur  a Bland, \"but, ne'ertheless, his shoulders are broad and his loins are  narrow, and seest thou, good master, how that his arms hang from his  body? They dangle not down like spindles, but hang stiff and bend at the  elbow. I take my vow, there be no bread and milk limbs in those fine  clothes, but stiff joints and tough thews.\"    \"Methinks thou art right, friend Arthur,\" said Little John.  \"I do  verily think that yon is no such roseleaf and whipped-cream gallant as  he would have one take him to be.\"    \"Pah!\" quoth Robin Hood, \"the sight of such a fellow doth put a nasty  taste into my mouth!  Look how he doth hold that fair flower betwixt his  thumb and finger, as he would say, 'Good rose, I like thee not so ill  but I can bear thy odor for a little while.' I take it ye are both  wrong, and verily believe that were a furious mouse to run across his  path, he would cry, 'La!' or 'Alack-a-day!' and fall straightway into a  swoon. I wonder who he may be.\"    \"Some great baron's son, I doubt not,\" answered Little John, \"with good  and true men's money lining his purse.\"    \"Ay, marry, that is true, I make no doubt,\" quoth Robin.  \"What a pity  that such men as he, that have no thought but to go abroad in gay  clothes, should have good fellows, whose shoes they are not fit to tie,  dancing at their bidding.  By Saint Dunstan, Saint Alfred, Saint  Withold, and all the good men in the Saxon calendar, it doth make me mad  to see such gay lordlings from over the sea go stepping on the necks of  good Saxons who owned this land before ever their great-grandsires  chewed rind of brawn! By the bright bow of Heaven, I will have their  ill-gotten gains from them, even though I hang for it as high as e'er a  forest tree in Sherwood!\"    \"Why, how now, master,\" quoth Little John, \"what heat is this? Thou dost  set thy pot a-boiling, and mayhap no bacon to cook! Methinks yon  fellow's hair is overlight for Norman locks. He may be a good man and  true for aught thou knowest.\"    \"Nay,\" said Robin, \"my head against a leaden farthing, he is what I say.  So, lie ye both here, I say, till I show you how I drub this fellow.\" So  saying, Robin Hood stepped forth from the shade of the beech tree,  crossed the stile, and stood in the middle of the road, with his hands  on his hips, in the stranger's path.    Meantime the stranger, who had been walking so slowly that all this talk  was held before he came opposite the place where they were, neither  quickened his pace nor seemed to see that such a man as Robin Hood was  in the world. So Robin stood in the middle of the road, waiting while  the other walked slowly forward, smelling his rose, and looking this way  and that, and everywhere except at Robin.    \"Hold!\" cried Robin, when at last the other had come close to him.  \"Hold!  Stand where thou art!\"    \"Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?\" said the stranger in soft and  gentle voice.  \"And wherefore should I stand where I am? Ne'ertheless,  as thou dost desire that I should stay, I will abide for a short time,  that I may hear what thou mayst have to say to me.\"    \"Then,\" quoth Robin, \"as thou dost so fairly do as I tell thee, and dost  give me such soft speech, I will also treat thee with all due courtesy.  I would have thee know, fair friend, that I am, as it were, a votary at  the shrine of Saint Wilfred who, thou mayst know, took, willy-nilly, all  their gold from the heathen, and melted it up into candlesticks.  Wherefore, upon such as come hereabouts, I levy a certain toll, which I  use for a better purpose, I hope, than to make candlesticks withal.  Therefore, sweet chuck, I would have thee deliver to me thy purse, that  I may look into it, and judge, to the best of my poor powers, whether  thou hast more wealth about thee than our law allows. For, as our good  Gaffer Swanthold sayeth, 'He who is fat from overliving must needs lose  blood.'\"    All this time the youth had been sniffing at the rose that he held  betwixt his thumb and finger.  \"Nay,\" said he with a gentle smile, when  Robin Hood had done, \"I do love to hear thee talk, thou pretty fellow,  and if, haply, thou art not yet done, finish, I beseech thee. I have yet  some little time to stay.\"    \"I have said all,\" quoth Robin, \"and now, if thou wilt give me thy  purse, I will let thee go thy way without let or hindrance so soon as I  shall see what it may hold.  I will take none from thee if thou hast but  little.\"    \"Alas!  It doth grieve me much,\" said the other, \"that I cannot do as  thou dost wish.  I have nothing to give thee.  Let me go my way, I  prythee. I have done thee no harm.\"    \"Nay, thou goest not,\" quoth Robin, \"till thou hast shown me thy purse.\"    \"Good friend,\" said the other gently, \"I have business elsewhere. I have  given thee much time and have heard thee patiently. Prythee, let me  depart in peace.\"    \"I have spoken to thee, friend,\" said Robin sternly, \"and I now tell  thee again, that thou goest not one step forward till thou hast done as  I bid thee.\"  So saying, he raised his quarterstaff above his head in a  threatening way.    \"Alas!\" said the stranger sadly, \"it doth grieve me that this thing must  be.  I fear much that I must slay thee, thou poor fellow!\" So saying, he  drew his sword.    \"Put by thy weapon,\" quoth Robin.  \"I would take no vantage of thee. Thy  sword cannot stand against an oaken staff such as mine. I could snap it  like a barley straw.  Yonder is a good oaken thicket by the roadside;  take thee a cudgel thence and defend thyself fairly, if thou hast a  taste for a sound drubbing.\"    First the stranger measured Robin with his eye, and then he measured the  oaken staff.  \"Thou art right, good fellow,\" said he presently, \"truly,  my sword is no match for that cudgel of thine.  Bide thee awhile till I  get me a staff.\" So saying, he threw aside the rose that he had been  holding all this time, thrust his sword back into the scabbard, and,  with a more hasty step than he had yet used, stepped to the roadside  where grew the little clump of ground oaks Robin had spoken of. Choosing  among them, he presently found a sapling to his liking. He did not cut  it, but, rolling up his sleeves a little way, he laid hold of it, placed  his heel against the ground, and, with one mighty pull, plucked the  young tree up by the roots from out the very earth. Then he came back,  trimming away the roots and tender stems with his sword as quietly as if  he had done nought to speak of.    Little John and the Tanner had been watching all that passed, but when  they saw the stranger drag the sapling up from the earth, and heard the  rending and snapping of its roots, the Tanner pursed his lips together,  drawing his breath between them in a long inward whistle.    \"By the breath of my body!\" said Little John, as soon as he could gather  his wits from their wonder, \"sawest thou that, Arthur? Marry, I think  our poor master will stand but an ill chance with yon fellow. By Our  Lady, he plucked up yon green tree as it were a barley straw.\"    Whatever Robin Hood thought, he stood his ground, and now he and the  stranger in scarlet stood face to face.    Well did Robin Hood hold his own that day as a mid-country yeoman. This  way and that they fought, and back and forth, Robin's skill against the  stranger's strength. The dust of the highway rose up around them like a  cloud, so that at times Little John and the Tanner could see nothing,  but only hear the rattle of the staves against one another. Thrice Robin  Hood struck the stranger; once upon the arm and twice upon the ribs, and  yet had he warded all the other's blows, only one of which, had it met  its mark, would have laid stout Robin lower in the dust than he had ever  gone before. At last the stranger struck Robin's cudgel so fairly in the  middle that he could hardly hold his staff in his hand; again he struck,  and Robin bent beneath the blow; a third time he struck, and now not  only fairly beat down Robin's guard, but gave him such a rap, also, that  down he tumbled into the dusty road.    \"Hold!\" cried Robin Hood, when he saw the stranger raising his staff  once more.  \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#19)"],[1,"passed two  generations ago; now the heaviest labors of the camp devolved upon them;  they were to harness the horses, pitch the lodges, dress the buffalo  robes, and bring in meat for the hunters. With the cracked voices of  these hags, the clamor of dogs, the shouting and laughing of children  and girls, and the listless tranquillity of the warriors, the whole  scene had an effect too lively and picturesque ever to be forgotten.    We stopped not far from the Indian camp, and having invited some of the  chiefs and warriors to dinner, placed before them a sumptuous repast of  biscuit and coffee. Squatted in a half circle on the ground, they soon  disposed of it. As we rode forward on the afternoon journey, several of  our late guests accompanied us. Among the rest was a huge bloated savage  of more than three hundred pounds' weight, christened La Cochon, in  consideration of his preposterous dimensions and certain corresponding  traits of his character. \"The Hog\" bestrode a little white pony, scarce  able to bear up under the enormous burden, though, by way of keeping  up the necessary stimulus, the rider kept both feet in constant motion,  playing alternately against his ribs. The old man was not a chief; he  never had ambition enough to become one; he was not a warrior nor a  hunter, for he was too fat and lazy: but he was the richest man in the  whole village. Riches among the Dakotas consist in horses, and of these  The Hog had accumulated more than thirty. He had already ten times as  many as he wanted, yet still his appetite for horses was insatiable.  Trotting up to me he shook me by the hand, and gave me to understand  that he was a very devoted friend; and then he began a series of most  earnest signs and gesticulations, his oily countenance radiant with  smiles, and his little eyes peeping out with a cunning twinkle from  between the masses of flesh that almost obscured them. Knowing nothing  at that time of the sign language of the Indians, I could only guess at  his meaning. So I called on Henry to explain it.    The Hog, it seems, was anxious to conclude a matrimonial bargain. He  said he had a very pretty daughter in his lodge, whom he would give  me, if I would give him my horse. These flattering overtures I chose to  reject; at which The Hog, still laughing with undiminished good humor,  gathered his robe about his shoulders, and rode away.    Where we encamped that night, an arm of the Platte ran between high  bluffs; it was turbid and swift as heretofore, but trees were growing on  its crumbling banks, and there was a nook of grass between the water  and the hill. Just before entering this place, we saw the emigrants  encamping at two or three miles' distance on the right; while the whole  Indian rabble were pouring down the neighboring hill in hope of the same  sort of entertainment which they had experienced from us. In the savage  landscape before our camp, nothing but the rushing of the Platte broke  the silence. Through the ragged boughs of the trees, dilapidated and  half dead, we saw the sun setting in crimson behind the peaks of the  Black Hills; the restless bosom of the river was suffused with red; our  white tent was tinged with it, and the sterile bluffs, up to the rocks  that crowned them, partook of the same fiery hue. It soon passed away;  no light remained, but that from our fire, blazing high among the dusky  trees and bushes. We lay around it wrapped in our blankets, smoking and  conversing until a late hour, and then withdrew to our tent.    We crossed a sun-scorched plain on the next morning; the line of old  cotton-wood trees that fringed the bank of the Platte forming its  extreme verge. Nestled apparently close beneath them, we could discern  in the distance something like a building. As we came nearer, it assumed  form and dimensions, and proved to be a rough structure of logs. It was  a little trading fort, belonging to two private traders; and originally  intended, like all the forts of the country, to form a hollow square,  with rooms for lodging and storage opening upon the area within. Only  two sides of it had been completed; the place was now as ill-fitted for  the purposes of defense as any of those little log-houses, which  upon our constantly shifting frontier have been so often successfully  maintained against overwhelming odds of Indians. Two lodges were pitched  close to the fort; the sun beat scorching upon the logs; no living thing  was stirring except one old squaw, who thrust her round head from the  opening of the nearest lodge, and three or four stout young pups, who  were peeping with looks of eager inquiry from under the covering. In a  moment a door opened, and a little, swarthy black-eyed Frenchman came  out. His dress was rather singular; his black curling hair was parted  in the middle of his head, and fell below his shoulders; he wore a tight  frock of smoked deerskin, very gayly ornamented with figures worked  in dyed porcupine quills. His moccasins and leggings were also gaudily  adorned in the same manner; and the latter had in addition a line of  long fringes, reaching down the seams. The small frame of Richard,  for by this name Henry made him known to us, was in the highest degree  athletic and vigorous. There was no superfluity, and indeed there  seldom is among the active white men of this country, but every limb was  compact and hard; every sinew had its full tone and elasticity, and the  whole man wore an air of mingled hardihood and buoyancy.    Richard committed our horses to a Navahoe slave, a mean looking fellow  taken prisoner on the Mexican frontier; and, relieving us of our rifles  with ready politeness, led the way into the principal apartment of his  establishment. This was a room ten feet square. The walls and floor were  of black mud, and the roof of rough timber; there was a huge fireplace  made of four flat rocks, picked up on the prairie. An Indian bow and  otter-skin quiver, several gaudy articles of Rocky Mountain finery, an  Indian medicine bag, and a pipe and tobacco pouch, garnished the walls,  and rifles rested in a corner. There was no furniture except a sort  of rough settle covered with buffalo robes, upon which lolled a  tall half-breed, with his hair glued in masses upon each temple,  and saturated with vermilion. Two or three more \"mountain men\" sat  cross-legged on the floor. Their attire was not unlike that of Richard  himself; but the most striking figure of the group was a naked Indian  boy of sixteen, with a handsome face, and light, active proportions, who  sat in an easy posture in the corner near the door. Not one of his limbs  moved the breadth of a hair; his eye was fixed immovably, not on any  person present, but, as it appeared, on the projecting corner of the  fireplace opposite to him.    On these prairies the custom of smoking with friends is seldom omitted,  whether among Indians or whites. The pipe, therefore, was taken from the  wall, and its great red bowl crammed with the tobacco and shongsasha,  mixed in suitable proportions. Then it passed round the circle, each man  inhaling a few whiffs and handing it to his neighbor. Having spent half  an hour here, we took our leave; first inviting our new friends to drink  a cup of coffee with us at our camp, a mile farther up the river. By  this time, as the reader may conceive, we had grown rather shabby; our  clothes had burst into rags and tatters; and what was worse, we had very  little means of renovation. Fort Laramie was but seven miles before us.  Being totally averse to appearing in such plight among any society that  could boast an approximation to the civilized, we soon stopped by the  river to make our toilet in the best way we could. We hung up small  looking-glasses against the trees and shaved, an operation neglected for  six weeks; we performed our ablutions in the Platte, though the utility  of such a proceeding was questionable, the water looking exactly like  a cup of chocolate, and the banks consisting of the softest and richest  yellow mud, so that we were obliged, as a preliminary, to build a  cause-way of stout branches and twigs. Having also put on radiant  moccasins, procured from a squaw of Richard's establishment, and made  what other improvements our narrow circumstances allowed, we took our  seats on the grass with a feeling of greatly increased respectability,  to wait the arrival of our guests. They came; the banquet was concluded,  and the pipe smoked. Bidding them adieu, we turned our horses' heads  toward the fort.    An hour elapsed. The barren hills closed across our front, and we could  see no farther; until having surmounted them, a rapid stream appeared  at the foot of the descent, running into the Platte; beyond was a green  meadow, dotted with bushes, and in the midst of these, at the point  where the two rivers joined, were the low clay walls of a fort. This  was not Fort Laramie, but another post of less recent date, which having  sunk before its successful competitor was now deserted and ruinous. A  moment after the hills, seeming to draw apart as we advanced, disclosed  Fort Laramie itself, its high bastions and perpendicular walls of  clay crowning an eminence on the left beyond the stream, while behind  stretched a line of arid and desolate ridges, and behind these again,  towering aloft seven thousand feet, arose the grim Black Hills.    We tried to ford Laramie Creek at a point nearly opposite the fort, but  the stream, swollen with the rains in the mountains, was too rapid. We  passed up along its bank to find a better crossing place. Men gathered  on the wall to look at us. \"There's Bordeaux!\" called Henry, his face  brightening as he recognized his acquaintance; \"him there with the  spyglass; and there's old Vaskiss, and Tucker, and May; and, by George!  there's Cimoneau!\" This Cimoneau was Henry's fast friend, and the only  man in the country who could rival him in hunting.
