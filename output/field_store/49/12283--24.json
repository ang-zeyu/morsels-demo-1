Then Falguna, the son of Pandu, taking with him a select  force, defeated the Daradas along with the Kambojas. Then the exalted  son of Indra vanquished the robber tribes that dwelt in the  north-eastern frontier and those also that dwelt in the woods. And, O  great king, the son of Indra also subjugated the allied tribes of the  Lohas, the eastern Kambojas, and northern Rishikas. And the battle with  the Rishikas was fierce in the extreme. Indeed, the fight that took  place between them and the son of Pritha was equal to that between the  gods and the Asuras in which Taraka (the wife of Vrihaspati) had become  the cause of so much slaughter. And defeating, O king, the Rishikas in  the field of battle, Arjuna took from them as tribute eight horses that  were of the colour of the parrot's breast, as also other horses of the  hues of the peacock, born in northern and other climes and endued with  high speed. At last having conquered all the Himalayas and the Nishkuta  mountains, that bull among men, arriving at the White mountains,  encamped on its breast.\"      SECTION XXVII    Vaisampayana said,--\"that heroic and foremost of the Pandavas endued  with great energy, crossing the White mountains, subjugated the country  of the Limpurushas ruled by Durmaputra, after a collision involving a  great slaughter of Kshatriyas, and brought the region under his  complete sway. Having reduced that country, the son of Indra (Arjuna)  with a collected mind marched at the head of his troops to the country  called Harataka, ruled by the Guhakas. Subjugating them by a policy of  conciliation, the Kuru prince beheld (in that region) that excellent of  lakes called Manasa and various other lakes and tanks sacred to the  Rishis. And the exalted prince having arrived at the lake Manasa  conquered the regions ruled by the Gandharvas that lay around the  Harataka territories. Here the conqueror took, as tribute from the  country, numerous excellent horses called Tittiri, Kalmasha, Manduka.  At last the son of the slayer of Paka, arriving in the country of North  Harivarsha desired to conquer it. Thereupon certain frontier-guards of  huge bodies and endued with great strength and energy, coming to him  with gallant hearts, said, 'O son of Pritha, this country can be never  conquered by thee. If thou seekest thy good, return hence. He that  entereth this region, if human, is sure to perish. We have been  gratified with thee; O hero, thy conquests have been enough. Nor is  anything to be seen here, O Arjuna, that may be conquered by thee. The  Northern Kurus live here. There cannot be war here. Even if thou  enterest it, thou will not be able to behold anything, for with human  eyes nothing can be seen here. If, however thou seekest anything else,  O Bharata tell us, O tiger among men, so that we may do thy bidding.'  Thus addressed by them, Arjuna smilingly addressing them, said,--'I  desire the acquisition of the imperial dignity by Yudhishthira the  just, of great intelligence. If your land is shut against human beings,  I shall not enter it. Let something be paid unto Yudhishthira by ye as  tribute.' Hearing these words of Arjuna, they gave him as tribute many  cloths and ornaments of celestial make, silks of celestial texture and  skins of celestial origin.    \"It was thus that tiger among men subjugated the countries that lay to  the North, having fought numberless battles with both Kshatriya and  robber tribes. And having vanquished the chiefs and brought them under  his sway he exacted from them much wealth, various gems and jewels, the  horses of the species called Tittiri and Kalmasha, as also those of the  colour of the parrot's wings and those that were like the peacocks in  hue and all endued with the speed of the wind. And surrounded, O king,  by a large army consisting of the four kinds of forces, the hero came  back to the excellent city of Sakraprastha. And Partha offered the  whole of that wealth, together with the animals he had brought, unto  Yudhishthira the just. And commanded by the monarch, the hero retired  to a chamber of the palace for rest.\"      SECTION XXVIII    Vaisampayana said,--\"in the meantime, Bhimasena also endued with great  energy, having obtained the assent of Yudhishthira the just marched  towards the eastern direction. And the tiger among the Bharatas,  possessed of great valour and ever increasing the sorrows of his foes,  was accompanied by a mighty host with the full complement of elephants  and horses and cars, well-armed and capable of crushing all hostile  kingdoms. That tiger among men, the son of Pandu, going first into the  great country of the Panchalas, began by various means to conciliate  that tribe. Then that hero, that bull of the Bharata race, within a  short time, vanquished the Gandakas and the Videhas. That exalted one  then subjugated the Dasarnas. There in the country of the Dasarnas, the  king called Sudharman with his bare arms fought a fierce battle with  Bhimasena. And Bhimasena, beholding that feat of the illustrious king,  appointed the mighty Sudharman as the first in command of his forces.  Then Bhima of terrible prowess marched towards the east, causing the  earth itself to tremble with the tread of the mighty host that followed  him. Then that hero who in strength was the foremost of all strong men  defeated in battle Rochamana, the king of Aswamedha, at the head of all  his troops. And the son of Kunti, having vanquished that monarch by  performing feats that excelled in fierceness, subjugated the eastern  region. Then that prince of the Kuru race, endued with great prowess  going into the country of Pulinda in the south, brought Sukumara and  the king Sumitra under his sway. Then, O Janamejaya, that bull in the  Bharata race, at the command of Yudhishthira the just marched against  Sisupala of great energy. The king of Chedi, hearing of the intentions  of the son of Pandu, came out of his city. And that chastiser of all  foes then received the son of Pritha with respect. Then, O king, those  bulls of the Chedi and the Kuru lines, thus met together, enquired  after each other's welfare. Then, O monarch, the king of Chedi offered  his kingdom unto Bhima and said smilingly,--'O sinless one, upon what  art thou bent?' And Bhima thereupon represented unto him the intentions  of king Yudhishthira. And Bhima dwelt there, O king, for thirty nights,  duly entertained by Sisupala. And after this he set out from Chedi with  his troops and vehicles.\"      SECTION XXIX    Vaisampayana said,--\"that chastiser of all foes then vanquished king  Srenimat of the country of Kumara, and then Vrihadvala, the king of  Kosala. Then the foremost of the sons of Pandu, by performing feats  excelling in fierceness, defeated the virtuous and mighty king  Dirghayaghna of Ayodhya. And the exalted one then subjugated the  country of Gopalakaksha and the northern Kosalas and also the king of  Mallas. And the mighty one, arriving then in the moist region at the  foot of the Himalayas soon brought the whole country under his sway.  And that bull of Bharata race brought under control in this way diverse  countries. And endued with great energy and in strength the foremost of  all strong men, the son of Pandu next conquered the country of  Bhallata, as also the mountain of Suktimanta that was by the side of  Bhallata. Then Bhima of terrible prowess and long arms, vanquishing in  battle the unretreating Suvahu the king of Kasi, brought him under  complete sway. Then that bull among the sons of Pandu overcame in  battle, by sheer force, the great king Kratha reigning in the region  lying about Suparsa. Then the hero of great energy vanquished the  Matsya and the powerful Maladas and the country called Pasubhumi that  was without fear or oppression of any kind. And the long-armed hero  then, coming from that land, conquered Madahara, Mahidara, and the  Somadheyas, and turned his steps towards the north. And the mighty son  of Kunti then subjugated, by sheer force, the country called  Vatsabhumi, and the king of the Bhargas, as also the ruler of the  Nishadas and Manimat and numerous other kings. Then Bhima, with  scarcely any degree of exertion and very soon, vanquished the southern  Mallas and the Bhagauanta mountains. And the hero next vanquished, by  policy alone, the Sarmakas and the Varmakas. And that tiger among men  then defeated with comparative ease that lord of earth, Janaka the king  of the Videhas. And the hero then subjugated strategically the Sakas  and the barbarians living in that part of the country. And the son of  Pandu, sending forth expeditions from Videha, conquered the seven kings  of the Kiratas living about the Indra mountain. The mighty hero then,  endued with abundant energy, vanquished in battle the Submas and the  Prasuhmas. And winning them over to his side, the son of Kunti,  possessed of great strength, marched against Magadha. On his way he  subjugated the monarchs known by the names of Danda and Dandadhara. And  accompanied by those monarchs, the son of Pandu marched against  Girivraja. After bringing the son of Jarasandha under his sway by  conciliation and making him pay tribute, the hero then accompanied by  the monarchs he had vanquished, marched against Kansa. And making the  earth tremble by means of his troops consisting of the four kinds of  forces, the foremost of the Pandavas then encountered Karna that slayer  of foes. And, O Bharata, having subjugated Karna and brought him under  his sway, the mighty hero then vanquished the powerful king of the  mountainous regions. And the son of Pandu then slew in a fierce  encounter, by the strength of his arms, the mighty king who dwelt in  Madagiri. And the Pandava then, O king, subjugated in battle those  strong and brave heroes of fierce prowess, viz., the heroic and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#18)"],[1,"    *       *       *       *       *    LAWS OF NORTH CAROLINA FROM 1827 TO 1831, PAGE II, VOL. I, CHAPTER XIX,  IN STATE LIBRARY. ACT OF NOV. 17TH, 1828.    \"An act concerning the lands formerly occupied by the Tuscarora tribe of  Indians lying in Bertie County, on the north side of Roanoke river.    \"Whereas the Tuscarora Indians have for more than a century been the firm  and undividing friends of the white people of this country, insomuch that  the people of North Carolina not only render to them full and complete  Justice, but also to exercise towards them that spirit of generosity  which their conduct has merrited: Therefore,    \"I. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina,  and is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that William R. Smith  of Halifax, Simon J. Barker, of Martin and William Brittin of Bertie, be,  and they are hereby appointed commissioners for the purpose of  advertising and selling in manner hereinafter directed, the above named  tract of land bounded as follows, to wit: beginning at the mouth of  Quitsnoy swamp; running up the swamp 430 poles to a scrubby oak, near the  head of said swamp by a great spring; thence north 10 degrees east 850  poles, to a persimmon tree, on Raquis Swamp; thence along the swamp and  Pocasin main course north 57 degrees west 2,640 poles, to a hickory on  the east side of Falling Run on Deep Creek, and down the various courses  of said Run to Roanoke River; then down the river to the first station.    \"II. And be it further enacted, That the title so to be sold by said  commissioners shall be understood to extend only to the reversion of the  State in said lands after the expiration of the lease from the Indians,  under which they are now held, and after the ratification of this act,  and notice thereof to the commissioners, it shall be their duty to  proceed forthwith to advertise in the newspapers most convenient to the  premises, and also in five of the most public places in the counties of  Bertie, Halifax and Martin, including the court houses in said counties,  that a sale of said lands, according to the provisions of this act, will  take place on Tuesday of the ensuing March term of the Superior Court of  Birtie county, that is, on the 17th day of March next; and it shall be  the duty of the said commissioners to attend to the aforesaid time and  place, and offer in the court house yard, at public sale to the highest  bidder, the said lands, according to advertisement, subject however to  the lease aforesaid, and the commissioners shall have power to continue  or postpone the sale from day to day until the end of the week, and  should they, by unavoidable accident or otherwise be prevented from  selling all or any part of the lands during the same week, it shall be  their duty to advertise in like manner, for two months next preceding the  following September term of the Bertie court, and to sell at said term,  as is heretofore directed, at the March term, and said commissioners  shall be empowered to put up said lands in such parcels as they may deem  most advantageous for selling, and that they shall give the purchasers a  credit of twelve months on one-half the purchase money, and a credit of  twelve months on the other half; Provided always, that the purchaser  shall deliver to the commissioners bonds with good and sufficient  security for the same, payable to the Governor of the State.    \"III. And be it further enacted, That should the commissioners upon  offering said lands as aforesaid perceive that they were likely to be  sacrificed, or to sell for an amount greatly below their value, it shall  be their duty forthwith to discontinue the sale, and it shall be the duty  of the commissioners after making sale, or if no sale be made,  immediately after September next to make report to the public Treasurer  of the State of all such proceedings that they may have had under this  act and also to hand over to him all such bonds as they may have taken  from purchasers; and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State, upon  a certificate from the Treasurer of payment of the purchase money and a  certificate from the commissioners of the boundaries of the land so  purchased, to grant a title of release from the State of North Carolina  to such persons as may be reported purchasers by said commissioners under  the act of Assembly.    \"IV. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the public  Treasurer to collect the money on said lands when they shall become due  and hold the same subject to the order of the Tuscarora tribe of Indians;  and whenever such order shall be presented, properly and duly  authenticated, by said tribe or nation of Indians, it shall be his duty  to pay the same over accordingly; Provided always that upon paying such  monies, the Public Treasurer shall take from said Indians or agents, a  full and complete release of all such claim, pretence of title, as they  now make or ever may have to the aforesaid tract of lands.    \"V. And be it further enacted, That the commissioners shall be allowed  each the sum of three dollars for every day that they shall necessarily  be employed in examining said lands, or in attending the sale of same, to  be paid out of the funds arising from the sale.    \"VI. Be it further enacted, That if it should appear at any time  thereafter that the said Indians have parted with their claims, or  contracted for the same, so that in fact the benefit of the sale shall,  agreeable to the provisions of this act, revert to the State.\"    Governor John Owen, Esq., appointed as commissioners, William R. Smith,  of Halifax; Simon J. Baker, of Martin; and William Brittain, of Birtie;  to sell the Tuscarora lands in pursuance to the lease effected by the  help of the General Assembly, Nov. 17, 1823, of which they reported to  William Roberts, Public Treasurer--in bonds the sum of $2977.87, payable  in installments of one and two years from the 17th day of March, 1829,  which are on file in the Public Treasurer's Office. And on Nov. 21, 1831,  William S. Mahon, the Public Treasarer, re-reported cash in bonds for  sale of Tuscarora lands--    Principle............................... $1400.27.  Interest................................    30.74.  Total................................... $1431.01.    Another report of the same man January, 1832, that all has been  collected, and remains in the treasury, subject to the order of the  Indians. $3,220.71-1/4.    Paid on May 3ist, 1831, and found on file.    \"For this amount paid Bates Cooke, being their agent to receive the same  under the Act of Assembly of 1828, $3,220.71-1/4.\"    In about the year 1818, the New York Indians, (which includes the  Tuscaroras), were engaged in a stipulation, to buy a tract of land from  the Menomonees and Winnebagoes, which was questioned in Congress about  the validity of a contract on purchases of lands between Indian nations.  But Congress did concur in the stipulation made between the New York  Indians of the first part, and the Menomonees and Winnebagoes of the  second part, for lands lying in Green Bay, Wisconsin, bought and paid for  by the former according to the stipulation concluded in the year 1822.    For the payment of the said land above, I can only speak for the  Tuscaroras. The precise amount paid I am unable to state. But a tax was  made on the nation; children paid twenty-five cents each, adults paid  more according to their ability; the amount obtained in this way I am  unable to state. They also gave their annuities of two years, which they  drew from the government, and also two hundred dollars in money which  they loaned from the Oneida Indians (which they afterwards refunded).    All those goods and moneys were paid to the Menomonees and Winnebagoes,  as their part of the Green Bay lands. These facts I obtained of the widow  of Jonathan Printup, an honorable chief of the Tuscarara nation, by whom  was entrusted with the goods and money for the payment of said lands,  which he faithfully performed, and was accompanied as delegates by Dr.  John Patterson and James Cusick, who were appointed to the honorable  office of purchasing a tract of land for a future home of their people. I  am indebted to the widow of Dr. John Patterson, and also his brother  Harry, for information which corroborates with that of the widow above  mentioned, and also of other old people.    In a short time afterwards, the Menomonees denied the contract in various  ways, they denied the efficiency of the Chiefs who signed the treaty, and  also denied of having received any payment, and also denied the boundary  of the land ceded. This naturally created difficulty and discord between  them, and kept growing worse from year to year. But the Winebagoes never  denied any of the denials of the Menomonees.    In a treaty of the United States and the Menomonees and Winebagoes, of  Feb. 6th, 1826, in Article 8th, it was acknowledged that there existed  some uncertainty in consequence of the cession made by the tribes upon  Fox River and Green Bay, to the New York Indians. Finally the Menomonees  made their complaint before the President, concerning the New York  Indians, which has reference to the case, in the treaty by the United  States, with the several tribes of Green Bay on Feb. 23rd, 1829, in  Article 2nd, which read as follows, viz:    \"Much difficulty having arising from the negotiations between the  Menomonees and Winebago tribes and the various tribes and portions of  tribes of Indian of the State of New York, and the claims of the  respective parties being much contested, as well with relation to the  tenure and boundaries of the two tracts claimed by the New York Indians,  west of Lake Michigan, as to the authority of the persons who signed the  agreement on the part of the Monomonees, and the whole subject having  been fully examined at the council this day concluded, and the  allegations,"]]]
