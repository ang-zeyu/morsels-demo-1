But Thomas  de Vaux was no courtier; the phrase which had offered had risen  spontaneously to his lips, and he knew not how to pursue the pleasing  theme so as to soothe and prolong the vein which he had excited. He was  silent, therefore, until, relapsing into his moody contemplations, the  King demanded of him sharply, \"Despardieux! This is smoothly said to  soothe a sick man; but does a league of monarchs, an assemblage or  nobles, a convocation of all the chivalry of Europe, droop with the  sickness of one man, though he chances to be King of England? Why  should Richard's illness, or Richard's death, check the march of thirty  thousand men as brave as himself? When the master stag is struck down,  the herd do not disperse upon his fall; when the falcon strikes the  leading crane, another takes the guidance of the phalanx. Why do not  the powers assemble and choose some one to whom they may entrust the  guidance of the host?\"    \"Forsooth, and if it please your Majesty,\" said De Vaux, \"I hear  consultations have been held among the royal leaders for some such  purpose.\"    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Richard, his jealousy awakened, giving his mental  irritation another direction, \"am I forgot by my allies ere I have taken  the last sacrament? Do they hold me dead already? But no, no, they are  right. And whom do they select as leader of the Christian host?\"    \"Rank and dignity,\" said De Vaux, \"point to the King of France.\"    \"Oh, ay,\" answered the English monarch, \"Philip of France and  Navarre--Denis Mountjoie--his most Christian Majesty! Mouth-filling  words these! There is but one risk--that he might mistake the words EN  ARRIERE for EN AVANT, and lead us back to Paris, instead of marching to  Jerusalem. His politic head has learned by this time that there is more  to be gotten by oppressing his feudatories, and pillaging his allies,  than fighting with the Turks for the Holy Sepulchre.\"    \"They might choose the Archduke of Austria,\" said De Vaux.    \"What! because he is big and burly like thyself, Thomas--nearly as  thick-headed, but without thy indifference to danger and carelessness  of offence? I tell thee that Austria has in all that mass of flesh no  bolder animation than is afforded by the peevishness of a wasp and the  courage of a wren. Out upon him! He a leader of chivalry to deeds  of glory! Give him a flagon of Rhenish to drink with his besmirched  baaren-hauters and lance-knechts.\"    \"There is the Grand Master of the Templars,\" continued the baron, not  sorry to keep his master's attention engaged on other topics than his  own illness, though at the expense of the characters of prince and  potentate. \"There is the Grand Master of the Templars,\" he continued,  \"undaunted, skilful, brave in battle, and sage in council, having no  separate kingdoms of his own to divert his exertions from the recovery  of the Holy Land--what thinks your Majesty of the Master as a general  leader of the Christian host?\"    \"Ha, Beau-Seant?\" answered the King. \"Oh, no exception can be taken to  Brother Giles Amaury; he understands the ordering of a battle, and the  fighting in front when it begins. But, Sir Thomas, were it fair to take  the Holy Land from the heathen Saladin, so full of all the virtues which  may distinguish unchristened man, and give it to Giles Amaury, a worse  pagan than himself, an idolater, a devil-worshipper, a necromancer, who  practises crimes the most dark and unnatural in the vaults and secret  places of abomination and darkness?\"    \"The Grand Master of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem is not  tainted by fame, either with heresy or magic,\" said Thomas de Vaux.    \"But is he not a sordid miser?\" said Richard hastily; \"has he not been  suspected--ay, more than suspected--of selling to the infidels those  advantages which they would never have won by fair force? Tush, man,  better give the army to be made merchandise of by Venetian skippers and  Lombardy pedlars, than trust it to the Grand Master of St. John.\"    \"Well, then, I will venture but another guess,\" said the Baron de Vaux.  \"What say you to the gallant Marquis of Montserrat, so wise, so elegant,  such a good man-at-arms?\"    \"Wise?--cunning, you would say,\" replied Richard; \"elegant in a lady's  chamber, if you will. Oh, ay, Conrade of Montserrat--who knows not the  popinjay? Politic and versatile, he will change you his purposes as  often as the trimmings of his doublet, and you shall never be able to  guess the hue of his inmost vestments from their outward colours. A  man-at-arms? Ay, a fine figure on horseback, and can bear him well in  the tilt-yard, and at the barriers, when swords are blunted at point  and edge, and spears are tipped with trenchers of wood instead of steel  pikes. Wert thou not with me when I said to that same gay Marquis, 'Here  we be, three good Christians, and on yonder plain there pricks a band of  some threescore Saracens--what say you to charge them briskly? There are  but twenty unbelieving miscreants to each true knight.\"    \"I recollect the Marquis replied,\" said De Vaux, \"that his limbs were  of flesh, not of iron, and that he would rather bear the heart of a  man than of a beast, though that beast were the lion, But I see how  it is--we shall end where we began, without hope of praying at the  Sepulchre until Heaven shall restore King Richard to health.\"    At this grave remark Richard burst out into a hearty fit of laughter,  the first which he had for some time indulged in. \"Why what a thing is  conscience,\" he said, \"that through its means even such a thick-witted  northern lord as thou canst bring thy sovereign to confess his folly!  It is true that, did they not propose themselves as fit to hold my  leading-staff, little should I care for plucking the silken trappings  off the puppets thou hast shown me in succession. What concerns it me  what fine tinsel robes they swagger in, unless when they are named as  rivals in the glorious enterprise to which I have vowed myself? Yes,  De Vaux, I confess my weakness, and the wilfulness of my ambition. The  Christian camp contains, doubtless, many a better knight than Richard of  England, and it would be wise and worthy to assign to the best of them  the leading of the host. But,\" continued the warlike monarch, raising  himself in his bed, and shaking the cover from his head, while his eyes  sparkled as they were wont to do on the eve of battle, \"were such a  knight to plant the banner of the Cross on the Temple of Jerusalem while  I was unable to bear my share in the noble task, he should, so soon as I  was fit to lay lance in rest, undergo my challenge to mortal combat,  for having diminished my fame, and pressed in before to the object of my  enterprise. But hark, what trumpets are those at a distance?\"    \"Those of King Philip, as I guess, my liege,\" said the stout Englishman.    \"Thou art dull of ear, Thomas,\" said the King, endeavouring to start up;  \"hearest thou not that clash and clang? By Heaven, the Turks are in the  camp--I hear their LELIES.\" [The war-cries of the Moslemah.]    He again endeavoured to get out of bed, and De Vaux was obliged to  exercise his own great strength, and also to summon the assistance of  the chamberlains from the inner tent, to restrain him.    \"Thou art a false traitor, De Vaux,\" said the incensed monarch, when,  breathless and exhausted with struggling, he was compelled to submit  to superior strength, and to repose in quiet on his couch. \"I would I  were--I would I were but strong enough to dash thy brains out with my  battle-axe!\"    \"I would you had the strength, my liege,\" said De Vaux, \"and would  even take the risk of its being so employed. The odds would be great in  favour of Christendom were Thomas Multon dead and Coeur de Lion himself  again.\"    \"Mine honest faithful servant,\" said Richard, extending his hand, which  the baron reverentially saluted, \"forgive thy master's impatience of  mood. It is this burning fever which chides thee, and not thy kind  master, Richard of England. But go, I prithee, and bring me word what  strangers are in the camp, for these sounds are not of Christendom.\"    De Vaux left the pavilion on the errand assigned, and in his absence,  which he had resolved should be brief, he charged the chamberlains,  pages, and attendants to redouble their attention on their sovereign,  with threats of holding them to responsibility, which rather added to  than diminished their timid anxiety in the discharge of their duty; for  next, perhaps, to the ire of the monarch himself, they dreaded that  of the stern and inexorable Lord of Gilsland. [Sir Thomas Multon of  Gilsland.]        CHAPTER VII.         There never was a time on the march parts yet,       When Scottish with English met,       But it was marvel if the red blood ran not       As the rain does in the street.       --BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE.    A considerable band of Scottish warriors had joined the Crusaders,  and had naturally placed themselves under the command of the English  monarch, being, like his native troops, most of them of Saxon and  Norman descent, speaking the same languages, possessed, some of them, of  English as well as Scottish demesnes, and allied in some cases by blood  and intermarriage. The period also preceded that when the grasping  ambition of Edward I. gave a deadly and envenomed character to the wars  betwixt the two nations--the English fighting for the subjugation  of Scotland, and the Scottish, with all the stern determination and  obstinacy which has ever characterized their nation, for the defence  of their independence, by the most violent means, under the most  disadvantageous circumstances, and at the most extreme hazard. As yet,  wars betwixt the two nations, though fierce and frequent, had been  conducted on principles of fair hostility, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#19)"],[1,"of onions  chopped fine, 1/2 ounce bay leaves, 1/4 pound whole cloves, 2 quarts cider  vinegar and 25 quarts of water. Soak the pepper, cloves and bay leaves  for 48 hours in the vinegar. Put the water, salt and onions in a  kettle. Bring to a boil and cook 30 minutes, then add the vinegar and  spices. Let boil for one minute. Strain and it is ready for use.    Sterilize for 3 hours in hot-water-bath outfit.    Sterilize for 11/2 hours in steam pressure or pressure cooker (10 to 15  lbs. pressure).      CANNED FISH IN OIL    Rub fish with salt, brown sugar and saltpeter as above directed. Wash  and dry thoroughly in the sun. Spread on wire screens and dip in oil  heated to a temperature of 300 degrees. Use a strap handle plunge  thermometer to determine heat of oil. Cottonseed oil may be used for  this purpose, although olive oil is best. As soon as the fish are  cool enough to handle, pack tightly in cans, filling up with the hot  oil.    Sterilize 3 hours in hot-water-bath-outfit; 11/2 hours in steam pressure  or pressure cooker (10 to 15 lbs.).      CANNED FISH IN TOMATO SAUCE    Handle same as specified under \"Another Formula for Miscellaneous  Fish,\" except pour in the following sauce instead of pepper, cloves,  onions, etc.: Ten gallons of tomato pulp (mashed tomatoes and juice  with cores, seeds and skins removed); 1 gallon cider vinegar, 1 pint  Worcestershire sauce; 21/2 pounds red sweet peppers; 21/2 pounds sugar, 2  cups salt, 2 pounds onions (chopped fine); 1 pound West India peppers  and 1 ounce Saigon cinnamon. The fish are processed same as \"Fish in  Oil.\" Enamel lined cans or glass jars must be used.      FISH CHOWDER    The cleaned heads of any fish, the backbones cut out of large fish  with what meat adheres to them and all other fish scraps may be used  for fish chowder. Put all these parts in cold water (to cover) and  cook until all the meat can be easily removed from the bones. Pick all  the meat from the bones, strain the fish liquor and return it with the  picked fish meat to the kettle. Add the following ingredients: To  every two pounds of fish picked from bones and the liquor in which  fish was cooked add 6 onions, diced or sliced thin; 6 potatoes, diced  or sliced thin; 2 tablespoonfuls fat; 1 teaspoonful paprika; 2  teaspoonfuls salt or salt to taste.    Cook vegetables, fat and seasonings until vegetables are half done.  Pack hot in cans and sterilize same as all other fish. When the  chowder is opened, heat and add milk according to taste.      FISH ROE    For canning be sure to use roe of freshly caught fish and only such  roe as is known to be good to eat. The roe of some fishes, such as the  garfish, is not eaten.    Clean the roe by removing the shreds and strings adhering to it and  wash well in cold water, being careful not to break the roe. Soak for  2 hours in a brine made of 6 quarts of water and 6 ounces of salt.  Drain and pack in hot glass jars or enameled tin cans. Can for the  same length of time as other fish.      OYSTERS    Be sure all oysters that are to be canned are absolutely fresh, have  not \"soured\" and contain no spoiled oysters. Oysters are opened by  hand. All oysters should be rejected that have partly open shells, as  this is a sign that the oyster is dead and consequently not fit to  eat.    Rinse the oysters to prevent any pieces of shell or grit from getting  into the cans. Blanch 5 minutes. Cold-dip. If the canned oysters are  to be sold it is required by law to mark on each can the net weight of  solids or meat exclusive of liquids.    There have been a number of standard grades of oysters recognized on  the Baltimore market. They are given as follows: \"Standard Oysters\"  (four kinds).    No. 1 cans, containing respectively 11/2, 3, 4 and 5 ounces of meat,  after being processed in the cans.    No. 2 cans, containing respectively 3, 6, 8 and 10 ounces of meat.    \"Select\" and \"Extra Select\" Oysters contain respectively 6 ounces and  12 ounces for No. 1 and No. 2 cans. The above are the net weights of  meats only that have been drained over a strainer with a wire bottom  of 1/2 inch mesh. These are the only grades that have so far been  recognized by the trade. An even balance scale, with one platform for  graduated weights and another for articles to be weighed, is used to  weigh oysters or clams. It is suggested that those who are going to  can clams or oysters find out from their prospective customers just  what requirements are as to weights and then make their pack meet the  occasion. Under no circumstances is it advisable to make any  misstatements or misbrand in any respect.    After oysters have been packed in the can, fill with boiling brine  made of 5 quarts of water to 1/4 lb. salt to within 1/2 inch from top of  can. Sterilize as other fish.      CLAMS    If clams are received in a muddy condition, it is advisable, though  not necessary to wash them before opening. After opening, discard  broken or discolored clams. Do not can any clams unless absolutely  fresh. Blanch. Cold-dip. Weigh out the amount of solid meat, after  draining, that is to go into each can. Weigh and label just as oysters  are weighed and labeled.    Fill can to within 1/2 inch from the top with boiling brine made of 5  gallons of water and 1 pound of salt. Sterilize.      CLAM BROTH AND CHOWDER    Place the clams, after being opened, in a kettle with enough cold  water to cover. Add a few stalks of celery. Boil for 10 minutes.  Season with salt, and pepper to taste and add 1 tablespoon butter to  every 50 or 60 large clams. Can. Clam chowder can be made according to  any recipe and then canned.      SHRIMPS    Shrimps when first caught are a grayish white color. They are very  delicate and spoil quickly if allowed to stand for any length of time  in a warm place. There are two general methods of canning shrimp--the  \"dry pack\" and \"wet pack.\" Nearly all the trade now calls for \"wet  pack\" because the other always has a rather offensive odor and the  meat is never so fresh and sweet of flavor as the \"wet pack.\" Canned  shrimp is very pleasing to the taste and is preferred by many to  lobster for salads and stews.    Wet Pack. Medium sizes are preferable as very large shrimps are apt  to be too tough and too dry. Put the shrimps into a wire scalding  basket and lower into a boiling hot salt water solution made by mixing  one pound of salt to each gallon of water. Allow the shrimps to remain  in this bath for about five minutes, then remove and drain thoroughly.    Peel and remove viscera (entrails). The boiling and the salt will  harden the meat and make the peeling comparatively easy. Pack into  enameled tin cans or glass jars. Nos. 1 and 11/2 cans are used almost  exclusively. These sizes should contain 41/2 oz and 9 ounces of meat  respectively. It is unsafe to put in more meat than above directed,  for it might cake and become solid when processed.    Add a very mild brine to within 1/2 inch from top of can. For the brine  use 1 teaspoonful salt to 1 quart of boiling water. Sterilize.    Dry Pack. Handle same as above, except do not pour into the cans any  brine. The fish is packed in the cans and processed as follows without  the addition of any liquor.    Drying of Shrimps. After shrimps are boiled and peeled they may be  dried. Spread on a drier of any kind and dry at a temperature of from  110 deg.F. to 150 deg.F. When thoroughly dry pack in dry clean glass jars or  in parchment-paper lined boxes.      SALMON    Scale fish, clean and wipe dry. Do not wash. If the fish are large cut  in lengths to fill the cans and in sizes to pass through can openings  easily. Salmon is usually packed in No. 1 cans or in flat cans. Fill  cans with fish after it has been blanched 5 minutes and cold dipped.  Sterilize as other fish.    Many salmon packers lacquer the outside of their cans to prevent  rusting. This is a very advisable point. The test for unsound salmon  is the nose. If the contents issue an offensive odor, it is unsound.  Freezing does not hurt canned salmon.      AMERICAN OR DOMESTIC SARDINES    The fish taught and used for packing domestic sardines belong to the  herring family and are said to be of the same species as the sardines  of France, Portugal and Spain. There are two methods generally used in  canning sardines. First, when the fish are put in a sauce such as  mustard dressing or tomato sauce, and secondly where they are packed  in oil.      CANNING SARDINES IN SAUCE    The heads are cut off, the scales taken off and the fish cleaned.  Blanch 5 minutes; cold dip; drain and pack into the cans dry. Cover  with sauce, either mustard or tomato.      SARDINES IN OIL    The fish are prepared in the same manner as above described but  instead of blanching them, they are put in wire baskets and immersed  in boiling peanut or cottonseed oil until tender. Olive oil might be  used, but is rather expensive. When cooked, they are drained, packed  into cans in order, and the cans filled with olive oil. It is often  advisable to salt the fish while fresh and before cooking as it  improves the flavor.      CRAB MEAT    Put 5 gallons of water in a large kettle. Add 1/4 lb. of baking soda to  it. When boiling vigorously throw the live crabs in it and boil  quickly for 20 minutes. Remove crabs and wash them in cold water. Pick  out all meat. Wash the meat in a brine made of 1 ounce of salt  dissolved in three quarts of water. Drain and pack in enameled No. 1  flat cans. Sterilize. As soon as the time of sterilizing is up, plunge  the cans immediately into cold water, otherwise crab meat discolors.  For this reason, glass jars are not so well adapted to crab meat  canning as tin cans.      FLAKED CODFISH    The fish are first cleaned and the entrails removed, then the fins are  cut off. The fish are then soaked for about two hours in a salt brine  to remove the blood. This brine is made with about 10 lbs. of salt to  8 gallons of water. The brine is then rinsed off"]]]
