The face turns black;  the veins become turgid; insensibility and often convulsions ensue. If  relief is not secured within a few minutes, death will be inevitable.  [Footnote: The lack of oxygen, and the presence of carbonic-acid gas, are  the combined causes. Oxygen starvation and carbonic-acid poisoning, each  fatal in itself, work together to destroy life.] (See p. 264.)    7. _Diphtheria_ (_diphthera_, a membrane) is characterized by  fever, debility, and a peculiar sore throat, in which exuding fibrinous  matter forms a grayish white membrane, which afterward decomposes with a  fetid odor. Its sudden and insidious approach, contagious character, and  frequent fatality, render it an exceedingly dreaded disease. A  diphtheritic patient should be quarantined, and everything connected with  the sick room thoroughly disinfected.    8. _Croup_, which often attacks young children, is an inflammation of  the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea. It is commonly preceded by  a cold. The child sneezes, coughs, and is hoarse, but the attack  frequently comes on suddenly, and usually in the night. It is accompanied  by a peculiar \"brassy,\" ringing cough, which, once heard, can never be  mistaken. It may prove fatal within a few hours. (See p. 260.)    9. _Stammering_ depends, not on defects of the muscles, but on a want  of due control of the mind. When a stammerer is not too conscious of his  lack, and tries to form his words slowly, he speaks plainly, and may sing  well, for then his words must follow one another in rhythmic time. Many  persons who stammer in common conversation can talk with fluency when  making a speech. The stammerer should seek to discover the cause of his  difficulty, and to overcome it by vocal and respiratory exercise,  especially by speaking only after a full inspiration, and during a long,  slow expiration.

If you are so fortunate as to have  a fireplace in your room, paint it when not in use, put a bouquet of fresh  flowers in it every morning, if you please, or do anything to make it  attractive, but never _close it_; better use the fireboards for  kindling wood. It would be scarcely more absurd to take a piece of  elegantly-tinted court-plaster and stop up the nose, trusting to the  accidental opening and shutting of the mouth for fresh air, because you  thought it spoiled the looks of your face to have two such great, ugly  holes in it, than to stop your fireplace with elegantly-tinted paper, or a  Japanese fan, because it looks better.--Leeds.]    28.

THE ORGANS OF THE CIRCULATION are the _heart_, the _arteries_,  the _veins_, and the _capillaries_.    FIG. 35.    [Illustration: A, _corpuscles of human blood, highly magnified;_ B,  _corpuscles in the blood of an animal (a non mammal)._]    THE BLOOD is the liquid by means of which the circulation is effected. It  permeates every part of the body, except the cuticle, nails, hair, etc.  The average quantity in each person is about eighteen pounds. [Footnote:  It is difficult to estimate the exact amount, and therefore authorities  disagree. Foster places it at about one thirteenth of the body weight.] It  is composed of a thin, colorless liquid, the _plasma_, filled with  red disks or cells, [Footnote: There is also one white globular cell to  every three or four hundred red ones. The blood is no more red than the  water of a stream would be if you were to fill it with little red fishes.  Suppose the fishes to be very, very small--as small as a grain of sand--  and closely crowded together through the whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7001"],[0,"History of the Philippine Islands (#18)"],[1,"    FRAY MARTIN DE LA ASCENCION    The bodies of the martyrs, although watched for many days by the  Japanese, were removed by bits (especially those of the monks)  from the crosses as relics by the Christians of the place, who very  reverently distributed them around. Together with the staples and  the wood of the crosses they are now scattered throughout Christendom.    Two other religious of the same band, who were out of the house at  the time of the arrest, did not suffer this martyrdom. One, called  Fray Geronimo de Jesus,  [94] hid himself and went inland, in order  not to leave the country; the other, called Fray Agustin Rodriguez,  was sheltered by the fathers of the Society, who sent him away by way  of Macan. General Don Mathia and the Spaniards of the ship, naked  and stripped, left Japon. They embarked at Nangasaqui and went to  Manila in various ships which make that voyage for the Japanese and  Portuguese. The first news of this event was learned from them in the  month of May of ninety-seven. Great grief and sadness was caused by  the news, in the death of the holy religious, and in the disturbances  which were expected to take place in future dealings between Japon  and the Filipinas; as well as in the loss of the galleon and its  cargo en route to Nueva Espa√±a. The value of the vessel was over one  million [pesos?], and caused great poverty among the Spaniards. After  considering the advisable measures to take under the circumstances,  it was ultimately decided that, in order not to allow the matter to  pass, a circumspect man should be sent to Japon with letters from the  governor to Taicosama. The letters were to set forth the governor's  anger at the taking of the ship and merchandise from the Spaniards,  and at the killing of the religious; and were also to request Taicosama  to make all the reparation possible, by restoring and returning the  merchandise to the Spaniards, and the artillery, tackle, and spoils of  the vessel that were left, as well as the bodies of the religious whom  he had crucified; and Taicosama was so to arrange matters thenceforth,  that Spaniards should not be so treated in his kingdom.    The governor sent Don Luis Navarrete  [95] Fajardo as bearer of this  message, and a present of some gold and silver ornaments, swords,  and valuable cloth for Taicosama. He also sent him an elephant  well caparisoned and covered with silk, and with its naires [i.e.,  elephant keepers] in the same livery, a thing never before seen in  Xapon. According to the custom of that kingdom, Don Luis was to make  the present to Taico when he presented his embassy, for the Japanese  are wont to give or receive embassies in no other manner. When Don  Luys de Navarrete reached Nangasaqui, Taicosama readily sent from  the court for the ambassador and for the present which had been sent  him from Luzon, for he was anxious to see the gifts, especially the  elephant, with which he was greatly delighted. He heard the embassy  and replied with much ostentation and display, exculpating himself  from the death of the religious upon whom he laid the blame, saying  that after he had forbidden them to christianize, or teach their  religion, they had disregarded his orders in his own court. Likewise,  the seizure of the ship and its merchandise, which entered the port  of Hurando in the province of Toza, had been a justifiable procedure,  according to the laws of Japon, because all ships lost on its coast  belong to the king, with their merchandise. Nevertheless, he added  that he was sorry for all that had happened, and that he would return  the merchandise had it not been distributed. As to the religious,  there was no remedy for it. But he begged the governor of Manila not  to send such persons to Xapon, for he had again passed laws forbidding  the making of Christians under pain of death. He would deliver whatever  had remained of the bodies of the religious and would be glad to have  peace and friendship with the Luzon Islands and the Spaniards, and  for his part, would endeavor to secure it. He said that if any other  vessel came to his kingdom from Manila, he would give orders that it  be well received and well treated. With this reply and a letter of the  same purport for the governor, Don Luys Navarrete was dismissed. He  was given a present for the governor consisting of lances, armor, and  catans, considered rare and valuable by the Japanese. The ambassador  thereupon left Miaco and went to Nangasaqui, whence by the first ship  sailing to Manila, he sent word to Governor Don Francisco concerning  his negotiations. But the message itself was taken later to Manila  by another person, on account of the illness and death of Don Luis in  Nangasaqui. Taicosama rejoiced over his answer to the ambassador, for  he had practically done nothing of what was asked of him. His reply  was more a display of dissembling and compliments than a desire for  friendship with the Spaniards. He boasted and published arrogantly,  and his favorites said in the same manner, that the Spaniards had sent  him that present and embassy through fear, and as an acknowledgment  of tribute and seigniory, so that he might not destroy them as he had  threatened them at other times in the past, when Gomez Perez Dasmari√±as  was governor. And even then the Spaniards had sent him a message and  a present by Fray Juan Cobo, the Dominican, and Captain Llanos.    The Japanese Faranda Quiemon sought war with Manila, and the favorites  who aided him did not neglect to beg Taico not to lose the opportunity  of conquering that city. They said that it would be easy, since  there were but few Spaniards there; that a fleet could be sent there  quickly, which Faranda would accompany. The latter assured Taico of  success, as one who knew the country and its resources. They urged  him so continually that Taico entrusted Faranda with the enterprise,  and gave him some supplies and other assistance toward it. Faranda  began to prepare ships and Chinese for the expedition, which he was  never able to carry out; for, being a man naturally low and poor,  he possessed neither the ability nor the means sufficient for the  enterprise. His protectors themselves did not choose to assist him, and  so his preparations were prolonged until the enterprise was abandoned  at the death of Taico, and his own death, as will be stated later.    Meanwhile news was constantly reaching Manila that a fleet was being  equipped in Japon, completely under the supervision of Faranda,  and it naturally caused some anxiety among the people in spite of  their courage and determination to resist him, for the enemy was  arrogant and powerful. Although the city was thoroughly resolved  and determined to resist him, yet the governor and city would never  show openly that they were aware of the change which Taico was about  to make, in order not to precipitate the war or give the other side  any reason for hastening it. Trusting to time for the remedy, they so  disposed affairs in the city, that they might be ready for any future  emergency. They sent the Japanese who had settled in Manila--and they  were not few--back to Xapon, and made those who came in merchant ships  give up their weapons until their return, which they endeavored to  hasten as much as possible; but in all other respects, they treated  them hospitably. And because it was heard that Taico intended to take  possession of the island of Hermosa, a well-provisioned island off the  Chinese coast, very near Luzon, and on the way to Xapon, in order to  make it serve as a way-station for his fleet, and thus carry on more  easily the war with Manila, the governor sent two ships of the fleet  under command of Don Juan de √áamuzio, to reconnoiter that island and  all its ports, and the nature of the place, in order to be the first  to take possession of it. At least, if means and time should fail  him, he was to advise China, and the viceroys of the provinces of  Canton and Chincheo, so that, since the latter were old-time enemies  of Xapon, they might prevent the Japanese from entering the island,  which would prove so harmful to all of them. In these measures and  precautions several days were spent in the matter. However, nothing  was accomplished by this expedition to Hermosa Island beyond advising  Great China of Xapon's designs.    Several days after the imprisonment of Father Alonso Ximenez in  Cochinchina where Captain and Sargento-mayor Juan Xuarez Gallinato  had left him, the kings of Tunquin and Sinua permitted him to return  to Manila. He took passage for Macan in a Portuguese vessel. Not only  did he arrive unwearied by his voyages, hardships, and imprisonment,  but with renewed energy and spirits proposed to set on foot again  the expedition to Camboja. Although little was known of the state  of affairs in that kingdom, and of the restoration of Prauncar to  his throne, he together with other religious of his order, persuaded  Don Luys Dasmari√±as, upon whom he exercised great influence, and who  was then living in Manila, taking no part in government affairs, and  inclined him to broach the subject of making this expedition anew and  in person and at his own expense, from which would ensue good results  for the service of God and of his Majesty. Don Luys discussed the  matter with Governor Don Francisco Tello, and offered to bear all  the expense of the expedition. But a final decision was postponed  until the receipt of news from Camboja, for their only information  was that Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso, leaving Captain Gallinato and  his ships in Cochinchina, had gone to Lao.    At the departure of Don Juan Ronquillo and his camp from Mindanao  River, the people of Tampacan were so disheartened, and the spirit of  those of Buhahayen so increased that, in spite of the friendship that  they had made, and the homage that they had rendered, they became  declared enemies [to the former].
