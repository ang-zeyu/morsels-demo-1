Meadows bright with clover-heads among the grasses, daisies, and  buttercups in June resound with the murmur of unwearying industry and  rapturous enjoyment. Bumblebees by the tens of thousands buzzing above  acres of the farmer's clover blossoms should be happy in a knowledge of  their benefactions, which doubtless concern them not at all. They have  never heard the story of the Australians who imported quantities of  clover for fodder, and had glorious fields of it that season, but not a  seed to plant next year's crops, simply because the farmers had failed  to import the bumblebee. After her immigration the clovers multiplied  prodigiously.    No; the bee's happiness rests on her knowledge that only the  butterflies' long tongues can honestly share with her the brimming wells  of nectar in each tiny floret. Children who have sucked them too  appreciate her rapture. If we examine a little flower under the  magnifying glass, we shall see why its structure places it in the pea  family. Bumblebees so depress the keel either when they sip, or feed on  pollen, that their heads and tongues get well dusted with the yellow  powder, which they transfer to the stigmas of other flowers; whereas the  butterflies are of doubtful value, if not injurious, since their long,  slender tongues easily drain the nectar without depressing the keel.  Even if a few grains of pollen should cling to their tongues, it would  probably be wiped off as they withdrew them through the narrow slit,  where the petals nearly meet, at the mouth of the flower. _Bombus  terrestris_ delights in nipping holes at the base of the tube, which  other pilferers also profit by. Our country is so much richer in  butterflies than Europe, it is scarcely surprising that Professor  Robertson found thirteen Lepidoptera out of twenty insect visitors to  this clover in Illinois, whereas Muller caught only eight butterflies on  it out of a list of thirty-nine visitors in Germany. The fritillaries  and the sulphurs are always seen about the clover fields among many  others, and the \"dusky wings\" and the caterpillar of several species  feed almost exclusively on this plant.    \"To live in clover,\" from the insect's point of view at least, may well  mean a life of luxury and affluence. Most peasants in Europe will tell  you that a dream about the flower foretells not only a happy marriage,  but long life and prosperity. For ages the clover has been counted a  mystic plant, and all sorts of good and bad luck were said to attend  the finding of variations of its leaves which had more than the common  number of leaflets. At evening these leaflets fold downward, the side  ones like two hands clasped in prayer, the end one bowed over them. In  this fashion the leaves of the white and other clovers also go to  sleep, to protect their sensitive surfaces from cold by radiation, it  is thought.      White Sweet Clover; Bokhara or Tree Clover; White Melilot; Honey  Lotus    _Melilotus alba_    _Flowers_--Small, white, fragrant, papilionaceous, the standard petal a  trifle longer than the wings; borne in slender racemes. _Stem:_ 3 to 10  ft. tall, branching. _Leaves:_ Rather distant, petioled, compounded of 3  oblong, saw-edged leaflets; fragrant, especially when dry.    _Preferred Habitat_--Waste lands, roadsides.    _Flowering Season_--June-November.    _Distribution_--United States, Europe, Asia.    Both the White and the Yellow Sweet Clover put their leaves to sleep at  night in a remarkable manner: the three leaflets of each leaf twist  through an angle of 90 degrees, until one edge of each vertical blade  is uppermost. The two side leaflets, Darwin found, always tend to face  the north with their upper surface, one facing north-northwest and the  other north-northeast, while the terminal leaflet escapes the chilling  of its sensitive upper surface through radiation by twisting to a  vertical also, but bending to either east or west, until it comes in  contact with the vertical upper surface of either of the side leaflets.  Thus the upper surface of the terminal and of at least one of the side  leaflets is sure to be well protected through the night; one is \"left  out in the cold.\"    The dried branches of sweet clover will fill a room with delightful  fragrance; but they will not drive away flies, nor protect woollens from  the ravages of moths, as old women once taught us to believe.           *       *       *       *       *    The ubiquitous White or Dutch Clover (_Trifolium repens_), whose  creeping branches send up solitary round heads of white or pinkish  flowers on erect, leafless stems, from May to December, in fields, open  waste land, and cultivated places throughout our area, Europe, and Asia,  devotes itself to wooing bees, since these are the only insects that  effect cross-fertilization regularly, other visitors aiding it only  occasionally. Its foliage is the favorite food of very many species of  caterpillars and of all grazing cattle the world around. This is still  another plant frequently miscalled shamrock. Good luck or bad attends  the finding of the leaves, when compounded of an even or an odd number  of leaflets more than the normal count, according to the saying of many  simple-minded folk.      Blue, Tufted, or Cow Vetch or Tare; Cat Peas; Tinegrass    _Vicia Cracca_    _Flowers_--Blue, later purple; 1/2 in. long, growing downward in 1-sided  spike, 15 to 40 flowered; calyx oblique, small, with unequal teeth;  corolla butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard, wings, and keel, all  oblong; the first clawed, the second oblique, and adhering to the  shorter keel; 10 stamens, 1 detached from other 9. _Stem:_ Slender,  weak, climbing or trailing, downy, 2 to 4 ft. long. _Leaves:_ Tendril  bearing, divided into 18 to 24 thin, narrow, oblong leaflets. _Fruit:_ A  smooth pod 1 in. long or less, 5 to 8 seeded.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry soil, fields, waste land.    _Flowering Season_--June-August.    _Distribution_--United States from New Jersey, Kentucky, and Iowa  northward and northwestward. Europe and Asia.    Dry fields blued with the bright blossoms of the Tufted Vetch, and  roadsides and thickets where the angular vine sends forth vivid patches  of color, resound with the music of happy bees. Although the parts of  the flower fit closely together, they are elastic, and opening with the  energetic visitor's weight and movement give ready access to the  nectary. On his departure they resume their original position, to  protect both nectar and pollen from rain and pilferers whose bodies are  not perfectly adapted to further the flower's cross-fertilization. The  common bumblebee (_Bombus terrestris_) plays a mean trick, all too  frequently, when he bites a hole at the base of the blossom, not only  gaining easy access to the sweets for himself, but opening the way for  others less intelligent than he, but quite ready to profit by his  mischief, and so defeat nature's plan. Doctor Ogle observed that the  same bee always acts in the same manner, one sucking the nectar  legitimately, another always biting a hole to obtain it surreptitiously,  the natural inference, of course, being that some bees, like small boys,  are naturally depraved.      Ground-nut    _Apios tuberosa (A. Apios)_    _Flowers_--Fragrant, chocolate brown and reddish purple, numerous, about  1/2 in. long, clustered in racemes from the leaf axils. Calyx 2-lipped,  corolla papilionaceous, the broad standard petal turned backward, the  keel sickle-shaped; stamens within it 9 and 1. _Stem:_ From tuberous,  edible rootstock; climbing, slender, several feet long, the juice milky.  _Leaves:_ Compounded of 5 to 7 ovate leaflets. _Fruit:_ A leathery,  slightly curved pod, 2 to 4 in. long.    _Preferred Habitat_--Twining about undergrowth and thickets in moist or  wet ground.    _Flowering Season_--July-September.    _Distribution_--New Brunswick to Ontario, south to the Gulf states  and Kansas.    No one knows better than the omnivorous \"barefoot boy\" that      \"Where the ground-nut trails its vine\"    there is hidden something really good to eat under the soft, moist soil  where legions of royal fern, usually standing guard above it, must be  crushed before he digs up the coveted tubers. He would be the last to  confuse it with the Wild Kidney Bean or Bean Vine (_Phaseolus  polystachyus_). The latter has loose racemes of smaller purple flowers  and leaflets in threes; nevertheless it is often confounded with the  ground-nut vine by older naturalists whose knowledge was \"learned of  schools.\"      Wild or Hog Peanut    _Amphicarpa monoica (Falcata comosa)_    _Flowers_--Numerous small, showy ones, borne in drooping clusters from  axils of upper leaves; lilac, pale purplish, or rarely white,  butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard petal partly enfolding wings  and keel. Calyx tubular, 4 or 5 toothed; 10 stamens (9 and 1); 1 pistil.  (Also solitary fertile flowers, lacking petals, on thread-like, creeping  branches from lower axils or underground.) _Stem:_ Twining wiry  brownish-hairy, 1 to 8 ft. long. _Leaves:_ Compounded of 3 thin  leaflets, egg-shaped at base, acutely pointed at tip. _Fruit:_ Hairy pod  1 in. long. Also 1-seeded, pale, rounded, underground peanut.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist thickets, shady roadsides.    _Flowering Season_--August-September.    _Distribution_--New Brunswick westward to Nebraska, south to Gulf  of Mexico.    _Amphicarpa_ (\"seed at both ends\"), the Greek name by which this  graceful vine is sometimes known, emphasizes its most interesting  feature, that, nevertheless, seems to many a foolish duplication of  energy on Nature's part. Why should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8909"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 1 (#18)"],[1," the torrid zone: the rein  deer is peculiar to the frozen climates of the North; Indostan is the  womb that matures the diamond; we do not find it produced in our own  country: the pine-apple grows in the common atmosphere of America; in  our climate it is never produced in the open ground, never until art has  furnished a sun analogous to that which it requires--the European in his  own climate finds not this delicious fruit. Man in different climates  varies in his colour, in his size, in his conformation, in his powers,  in his industry, in his courage, and in the faculties of his mind. But,  what is it that constitutes climate? It is the different position of  parts of the same globe, relatively to the sun; positions that suffice  to make a sensible variety in its productions.    There is, then, sufficient foundation to conjecture that if by any  accident our globe should become displaced, all its productions would of  necessity be changed; seeing that causes being no longer the same, or  no longer acting after the same manner, the effects would necessarily no  longer be what they now are, all productions, that they may be able to  conserve themselves, or maintain their actual existence, have occasion  to co-order themselves with the whole from which they have emanated.  Without this they would no longer be in a capacity to subsist: it is  this faculty of co-ordering themselves,--this relative adaption, which  is called the ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE: the want of it is called CONFUSION.  Those productions which are treated as MONSTROUS, are such as are unable  to co-order themselves with the general or particular laws of the beings  who surround them, or with the whole in which they find themselves  placed: they have had the faculty in their formation to accommodate  themselves to these laws; but these very laws are opposed to their  perfection: for this reason they are unable to subsist. It is thus that  by a certain analogy of conformation, which exists between animals of  different species, mules are easily produced; but these mules, unable to  co-order themselves with the beings that surround them, are not able to  reach perfection, consequently cannot propagate their species. Man can  live only in air, fish only in water: put the man into the water, the  fish into the air, not being able to co-order themselves with the fluids  which surround them, these animals will quickly be destroyed. Transport  by imagination, a man from our planet into SATURN, his lungs will  presently be rent by an atmosphere too rarified for his mode of being,  his members will be frozen with the intensity of the cold; he will  perish for want of finding elements analogous to his actual existence:  transport another into MERCURY, the excess of heat, beyond what his mode  of existence can bear, will quickly destroy him.    Thus, every thing seems to authorise the conjecture, that the human  species is a production peculiar to our sphere, in the position in which  it is found: that when this position may happen to change, the human  species will, of consequence, either be changed or will be obliged to  disappear; seeing that there would not then be that with which man could  co-order himself with the whole, or connect himself with that which can  enable him to subsist. It is this aptitude in man to co-order himself  with the whole, that not only furnishes him with the idea of order, but  also makes him exclaim \"_whatever is, is right_;\" whilst every thing is  only that which it can be, as long as the whole is necessarily what it  is; whilst it is positively neither good nor bad, as we understand those  terms: it is only requisite to displace a man, to make him accuse the  universe of confusion.    These reflections would appear to contradict the ideas of those, who  are willing to conjecture that the other planets, like our own, are  inhabited by beings resembling ourselves. But if the LAPLANDER differs  in so marked a manner from the HOTTENTOT, what difference ought we not  rationally to suppose between an inhabitant of our planet and one of  SATURN or of VENUS?    However it may be, if we are obliged to recur by imagination to the  origin of things, to the infancy of the human species, we may say that  it is probable that man was a necessary consequence of the disentangling  of our globe; or one of the results of the qualities, of the  properties, of the energies, of which it is susceptible in its present  position--that he was born male and female--that his existence is  co-ordinate with that of the globe, under its present position--that as  long as this co-ordination shall subsist, the human specie will conserve  himself, will propagate himself, according to the impulse, after  the primitive laws, which he has originally received--that if this  co-ordination should happen to cease; if the earth, displaced, should  cease to receive the same impulse, the same influence, on the part of  those causes which actually act upon it, or which give it energy; that  then the human species would change, to make place for new beings,  suitable to co-order themselves with the state that should succeed to  that which we now see subsist.    In thus supposing the changes in the position of our globe, the  primitive man did, perhaps, differ more from the actual man, than the  quadruped differs from the insect. Thus man, the same as every thing  else that exists on our planet, as well as in all the others, may be  regarded as in a state of continual vicissitude: thus the last term of  the existence of man is to us as unknown and as indistinct as the first:  there is, therefore, no contradiction in the belief that the species  vary incessantly--that to us it is as impossible to know what he will  become, as to know what he has been.    With respect to those who may ask why Nature does not produce new  beings? we may enquire of them in turn, upon what foundation they  suppose this fact? What it is that authorizes them to believe this  sterility in Nature? Know they if, in the various combinations which  she is every instant forming, Nature be not occupied in producing new  beings, without the cognizance of these observers? Who has informed them  that this Nature is not actually assembling, in her immense elaboratory,  the elements suitable to bring to light, generations entirely new,  that will have nothing in common with those of the species at present  existing? What absurdity then, or what want of just inference would  there be, to imagine that the man, the horse, the fish, the bird, will  be no more? Are these animals so indispensably requisite to Nature, that  without them she cannot continue her eternal course? Does not all change  around us? Do we not ourselves change? Is it not evident that the whole  universe has not been, in its anterior eternal duration, rigorously the  same that it now is? that it is impossible, in its posterior eternal  duration, it can be rigidly in the same state that it now is for a  single instant? How, then, pretend to divine that, to which the  infinite succession of destruction, of reproduction, of combination, of  dissolution, of metamorphosis, of change, of transposition, may be able  eventually to conduct it by their consequence? Suns encrust themselves,  and are extinguished; planets perish and disperse themselves in the vast  plains of air; other suns are kindled, and illumine their systems; new  planets form themselves, either to make revolutions round these suns,  or to describe new routes; and man, an infinitely small portion of the  globe, which is itself but an imperceptible point in the immensity  of space, vainly believes it is for himself this universe is made;  foolishly imagines he ought to be the confident of Nature; confidently  flatters himself he is eternal: and calls himself KING OF THE  UNIVERSE!!!    O man! wilt thou never conceive, that thou art but an ephemeron? All  changes in the great macrocosm: nothing remains the same an instant, in  the planet thou inhabitest: Nature contains no one constant form, yet  thou pretendest thy species can never disappear; that thou shalt be  exempted from the universal law, that wills all shall experience  change! Alas! In thy actual being, art not thou submitted to continual  alterations? Thou, who in thy folly, arrogantly assumest to thyself the  title of KING OF NATURE! Thou, who measurest the earth and the heavens!  Thou, who in thy vanity imaginest, that the whole was made, because thou  art intelligent! There requires but a very slight accident, a single  atom to be displaced, to make thee perish; to degrade thee; to ravish  from thee this intelligence of which thou appearest so proud.    If all the preceding conjectures be refused by those opposed to us; if  it be pretended that Nature acts by a certain quantum of immutable and  general laws; if it be believed that men, quadrupeds, fish, insects,  plants, are from all eternity, and will remain eternally, what they now  are: if I say it be contended, that from all eternity the stars have  shone, in the immense regions of space, have illuminated the firmament;  if it be insisted, we must no more demand why man is such as he appears,  then ask why Nature is such as we behold her, or why the world exists?  We are no longer opposed to such arguments. Whatever may be the system  adopted, it will perhaps reply equally well to the difficulties with  which our opponents endeavour to embarrass the way: examined closely, it  will be perceived they make nothing against those truths, which we have  gathered from experience. It is not given to man to know every thing--it  is not given him to know his origin--it is not given him to penetrate  into the essence of things, nor to recur to first principles--but it is  given him, to have reason, to have honesty, to ingenuously allow he  is ignorant of that which he cannot know, and not to substitute  unintelligible words, absurd suppositions, for his uncertainty."]]]
