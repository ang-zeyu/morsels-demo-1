The shed was cooled by electric fans that was over every \"shoot\";      The pens was of polished ma-ho-gany, and ev'rything else to suit;      The huts was fixed with spring-mattresses, and the tucker was           simply grand,      And every night by the biller-bong we darnced to a German band.       \"_Chorus, boys!\"_        There was short, plump girls, there was tall, slim girls,           and the handsomest ever seen      They was four-foot-five, they was six-foot high, and hevery size           between.      Our pay was the wool on the jumbucks' backs, so we shore till all           was blue      The sheep was washed afore they was shore (and the rams was scented           too);      And we all of us cried when the shed cut out, in spite of the           long, hot days,      For hevery hour them girls waltzed in with whisky and beer on           tr-a-a-a-ys!        \"_Chorus_! _you_ ----!\"        They had kind grey eyes, they had coal-black eyes, and the           grandest ever seen      They had plump pink hands, they had slim white hands, and hevery           shape be-tw-e-e-n.      There was three of them girls to every chap, and as jealous as they           could be--    \"Ow! you ----\"    The singer's voice or memory seemed suddenly to have failed him at this  point, but whether his mates hit him on the back of the head with a  tomahawk, or only choked him, I do not know. Mitchell was inclined to  think, from the sound of it, that they choked him.          THE LOST SOULS' HOTEL      Hunqerford Road, February. One hundred and thirty miles of heavy  reddish sand, bordered by dry, hot scrubs. Dense cloud of hot dust.  Four wool-teams passing through a gate in a \"rabbit proof\" fence which  crosses the road. Clock, clock, clock of wheels and rattle and clink of  chains, crack of whips and explosions of Australian language. Bales  and everything else coated with dust. Stink of old axle-grease and  tarpaulins. Tyres hot enough to fry chops on: bows and chains so hot  that it's a wonder they do not burn through the bullock's hides. Water  lukewarm in blistered kegs slung behind the wagons. Bullocks dragging  along as only bullocks do. Wheels ploughing through the deep sand, and  the load lurching from side to side. Half-way on a \"dry-stretch\" of  seventeen miles. Big \"tank\" full of good water through the scrub to the  right, but it is a private tank and a boundary-rider is shepherding it.  Mulga scrub and sparse, spiky undergrowth.    The carriers camp for dinner and boil their billies while the bullocks  droop under their yokes in the blazing heat; one or two lie down and  the leaders drag and twist themselves round under a dead tree, under  the impression that there is shade there. The carriers look like Red  Indians, with the masks of red dust \"bound\" with sweat on their faces,  but there is an unhealthy-looking, whitish space round their eyes,  caused by wiping away the blinding dust, sweat, and flies. The dry  sticks burn with a pale flame and an almost invisible thin pale  blue smoke. The sun's heat dancing and dazzling across every white  fence-post, sandhill, or light-coloured object in the distance.    One man takes off his boot and sock, empties half a pint of sand out of  them, and pulls up his trouser-leg. His leg is sheathed to the knee in  dust and sweat; he absently scrapes it with his knife, and presently he  amuses himself by moistening a strip with his forefinger and shaving it,  as if he were vaguely curious to see if he is still a white man.    The Hungerford coach ploughs past in a dense cloud of dust.    The teams drag on again like a \"wounded snake that dies at sundown,\"  if a wounded snake that dies at sundown could revive sufficiently next  morning to drag on again until another sun goes down.    Hopeless-looking swagmen are met with during the afternoon, and one  carrier--he of the sanded leg--lends them tobacco; his mates contribute  \"bits o'\" tea, flour, and sugar.    Sundown and the bullocks done up. The teamsters unyoke them and drive  them on to the next water--five miles--having previously sent a mate to  reconnoitre and see that boundary-rider is not round, otherwise, to make  terms with him, for it is a squatter's bore. They hurry the bullocks  down to the water and back in the twilight, and then, under cover of  darkness, turn them into a clearing in the scrub off the road, where a  sign in the grass might be seen--if you look close. But the \"bullockies\"  are better off than the horse-teamsters, for bad chaff is sold by the  pound and corn is worth its weight in gold.      Mitchell and I turned off the track at the rabbit-proof fence and made  for the tank in the mulga. We boiled the billy and had some salt mutton  and damper. We were making back for Bourke, having failed to get a cut  in any of the sheds on the Hungerford track. We sat under a clump of  mulga saplings, with our backs to the trunks, and got out our pipes.  Usually, when the flies were very bad on the track, we had to keep twigs  or wild-turkey=tail feathers going in front of our faces the whole time  to keep the mad flies out of our eyes; and, when we camped, one would  keep the feather going while the other lit his pipe--then the smoke  would keep them away. But the flies weren't so bad in a good shade or in  a darkened hut. Mitchell's pipe would have smoked out Old Nick; it  was an ancient string-bound meerschaum, and strong enough to kill a  blackfellow. I had one smoke out of it, once when I felt bad in my  inside and wanted to be sick, and the result was very satisfactory.    Mitchell looked through his old pocket-book--more by force of habit  than anything else--and turned up a circular from Tattersall's. And that  reminded him.    \"Do you know what I'd do, Harry,\" he said, \"if I won Tattersall's big  sweep, or was to come into fifty or a hundred thousand pounds, or,  better still, a million?\"    \"Nothing I suppose,\" I said, \"except to get away to Sydney or some  cooler place than this.\"    \"I'll tell you what I'd do,\" said Mitchell, talking round his pipe. \"I'd  build a Swagman's Rest right here.\"    \"A Swagman's Rest?\"    \"Yes. Right here on this very God-forsaken spot. I'd build a Swagman's  Rest and call it the Lost Souls' Hotel, or the Sundowners' Arms, or the  Half-way House to ----, or some such name that would take the bushmen's  fancy. I'd have it built on the best plans for coolness in a hot  country; bricks, and plenty of wide verandas with brick floors, and  balconies, and shingles, in the old Australian style. I wouldn't have  a sheet of corrugated iron about the place. And I'd have old-fashioned  hinged sashes with small panes and vines round 'em; they look cooler and  more homely and romantic than the glaring sort that shove up.    \"And I'd dig a tank or reservoir for surface water as big as a lake, and  bore for artesian water--and get it, too, if I had to bore right through  to England; and I'd irrigate the ground and make it grow horse-feed  and fruit, and vegetables too, if I had to cart manure from Bourke. And  every teamster's bullock or horse, and every shearer's hack, could burst  itself free, but I'd make travelling stock pay--for it belongs to the  squatters and capitalists. All carriers could camp for one night  only. And I'd--no, I wouldn't have any flowers; they might remind some  heart-broken, new-chum black sheep of the house where he was born, and  the mother whose heart he broke--and the father whose grey hairs he  brought down in sorrow to the grave--and break him up altogether.\"    \"But what about the old-fashioned windows and the vines?\" I asked.    \"Oh!\" said Mitchell, \"I forgot them. On second thought, I think I would  have some flowers; and maybe a bit of ivy-green. The new chum might be  trying to work out his own salvation, and the sight of the roses and ivy  would show him that he hadn't struck such a God-forgotten country after  all, and help strengthen the hope for something better that's in the  heart of every vagabond till he dies.\"    Puff, puff, puff, slowly and reflectively.    \"Until he dies,\" repeated Mitchell. \"And, maybe,\" he said, rousing  himself, \"I'd have a little room fixed up like a corner of a swell  restaurant, with silver and napkins on the table, and I'd fix up a  waiter, so that when a broken-down University wreck came along he might  feel, for an hour or so, something like the man he used to be. But I  suppose,\" Mitchell reflected, \"he wouldn't feel completely his old self  without a lady friend sitting opposite to him. I might fix up a black  gin for him, but I suppose he'd draw the colour line. But that's  nonsense.    \"All teamsters and travellers could camp there for one night only. I'd  have shower-baths; but I wouldn't force any man to have a bath  against his will. They could sit down to a table and have a feed off a  table-cloth, and sleep in sheets, and feel like they did before their  old mothers died, or before they ran away from home.\"    \"Who? The mothers?\" I asked.    \"Yes, in some cases,\" said Mitchell. \"And I'd have a nice, cool little  summer-house down near the artificial lake, out of earshot of the house,  where the bullock-drivers could sit with their pipes after tea, and tell  yarns, and talk in their own language. And I'd have boats on the lake,  too, in case an old "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#18)"],[1,"    \"This is certainly the case with most of the treasures hidden to the  west of the mountains. It was so at Pachacamac; it was so at Truxillo,  where the Spaniards found three million and a half dollars of gold; and  it is known that this was but a small hoard, and that the great one,  many times larger, has never been discovered. Probably the secret has  long been lost; for if there are but few who know where the Incas  buried their gold, it may well be believed that the exact locality of  the Chimoo treasures, which were buried more than eight hundred years  ago, is now unknown, and that nothing but vague traditions have been  handed down.\"    \"That one can quite understand,\" Harry agreed, \"when we consider how  many of the Chimoos must have fallen in the struggle with the Incas,  and how more than half the population were swept away by the Spaniards,  to say nothing of those who have died in the wars of the last thirty  years. It seems strange, however, that the treasures in the temple of  Pachacamac were left untouched by the Incas and allowed to accumulate  afterwards.\"    \"It was so generally regarded as the sacred city,\" Dias said, \"that,  powerful as they were, the Incas did not attempt to interfere with it,  as to do so would certainly have stirred up a formidable insurrection  of the natives throughout the whole of their territory; and instead,  therefore, of taking possession of the temple and dedicating it to  their own god, they allowed it to remain untouched and the worship of  the old gods to be carried on there, contenting themselves with  building a temple of their own to the Sun-god close at hand.\"    \"Whether any treasure we find belonged to the Incas or to the Chimoos  is of no consequence whatever. I certainly think that before entering  upon what would seem to be almost a hopeless search for such stores, we  should try this place that you know of. In that case it seems to me,  Dias, that if we had gone down the coast to Islay, and up through  Arequipa to Cuzco, our journey would have been considerably shorter.\"    \"That is true, senor, but we should have found it difficult to take a  passage for our mules; the steamers are but small craft, with poor  accommodation even for passengers. And besides, until we had made all  our arrangements for the journey from Lima, I could hardly say that I  had made up my mind to bring you to this place. Only when you and your  brother saved my life did I feel that I was bound to aid you, even to  the point of divulging the secret. It is different now from what it was  when it was first handed down. At that time the Spaniards were  mercilessly slaying all known to be in the possession of any secret  connected with gold, and every discovery of gold entailed the forced  labour of thousands more of the natives. Well, senor, all that is  changed; we are our own masters, and those who find mines are allowed  to work them on payment of certain royalties. There is, therefore, no  good in keeping a secret that has been useless for hundreds of years.\"    \"Certainly, Dias, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you  are injuring no one by the act, and are besides doing a very good  action to my brother and myself.    \"Well, Bertie,\" Harry said when Dias had left the room, \"I think we may  congratulate ourselves. For the first time I really think there is a  chance of the expedition turning out a success.\"    \"It certainly looks like it,\" Bertie agreed. \"For your sake I hope it  will be so. As for me, I am quite content; what with Indians and  brigands, wild beasts, alligators, and snakes, the journey is likely to  be an exciting one.\"          CHAPTER VI    A TROPICAL FOREST      It took them over three weeks to reach Cuzco. They did not hurry, for  they wished to keep the mules in good condition for the serious work  before them. They were travelling across a plateau thickly dotted with  villages and small towns, and everywhere richly cultivated. Near the  summit of the mountains large flocks of alpacas were grazing, and lower  down herds of cattle and sheep, while near the plain were patches of  wheat, barley, and potatoes, which in turn were succeeded by fields of  maize, apple and peach trees, and prickly-pears. At the foot were  fields of sugar-cane, oranges, citron, pine-apples, cacao, and many  other tropical fruits; while in the deeper ravines cotton was grown in  abundance for the wants of the population. Here, in fact, were all  varieties of climate, from the perpetual snow on the summits of the  lofty mountains to a tropical heat in the valleys.    \"If the Incas had been contented with this glorious plateau, which for  centuries constituted their kingdom, and had passed a law against the  gathering of gold and the mining for silver, they might still have been  lords here,\" Harry said one day. \"There would have been nothing to  tempt the avarice of the Spaniards, for owing to the distance of the  mines from the coast, the cost of carriage would have been immense, and  the long sea journey would have rendered the exportation of the natural  products of the country impossible. Some of the more sober-minded of  the Dons might have settled down here and taken wives from among the  daughters of the nobles, and, bringing with them the civilization of  Spain, become valuable colonists. The Incas, before they extended their  conquest over the whole of the west of South America, must have been a  comparatively simple people, and would have had none of the habits of  luxury and magnificence that tempted the Spaniards. The gold of South  America was the ruin of the Incas, as it was afterwards the chief cause  of the ruin of Spain.\"    \"Well, Harry, then I should very strongly advise you to give up  treasure-hunting and to remain poor, for the curse of the gold may not  have worked itself out yet.\"    \"I must risk that, Bertie. I have no desire for luxury or magnificence;  it is for a laudable purpose that I seek the gold. However, if you have  any scruples on the subject there is no occasion for you to have any  share in what I may discover.\"    \"No, I think I will agree with you and risk it; though certainly at  present I don't see what advantage any amount of money would be to me.\"    The houses of the peasants were for the most part comfortable, although  small, for since the expulsion of the Spaniards, the people had had no  reason to make a pretence of poverty. During the Spanish rule no one  dared, by the size of his house or by his mode of living, to show signs  of wealth above his fellows, for to do so would be to expose himself to  the cruel exactions of the tax-collectors and local officials; and even  now they had hardly recognized the change that had taken place, and  remained wedded to the habits that had become rooted in them by  centuries of oppression.    The travellers had no difficulty whatever in purchasing food and forage  on the way. They always slept in their tents now, and preferred Donna  Maria's cooking to that which they could obtain in the small and  generally dirty inns in the towns.    By the time they reached Cuzco, Bertie was able to converse in Spanish  with some fluency. On the way he rode either beside Dias and his wife,  or with Jose; in either case an animated conversation was kept up,  sometimes on the stirring events of the war of independence and the  subsequent struggles, sometimes about life in England, its ways and  customs, concerning which neither Maria nor Jose had any knowledge  whatever. Bertie also endeavoured to gain some information concerning  the history of Peru prior to the rising against Spain; but neither the  woman nor boy knew anything of the subject beyond the fact that the  Incas were great people, and that the natives still mourned for them.    \"You see that black apron most of the women wear over one hip, as a  sign of mourning; it is still worn for the Incas. They must have been  good people, and not cruel like the Spanish, or they would not be so  much regretted,\" Maria said. \"I don't wear the apron, because both Dias  and I are of mixed blood, descendants on one side of natives, and on  the other of Creoles, that is of Spaniards whose families were settled  here, and who hated their countrymen just as much as we do. Well, there  is Cuzco in sight. I have never seen it, and am glad that we shall stay  there for a few days.\"    The old capital of the Incas lay at the end of a valley about two miles  in length, and about a mile in width. To the north of the city rose an  abrupt hill, crowned by the great citadel with its three lines of  walls, the hill being divided from those forming the side of the valley  by two deep ravines, in which flowed little streams that ran through  the city. The appearance of the town was striking. There were numerous  churches, its streets ran at right angles to each other, and the  massive stone houses dated from the early Spanish days, though they  were surmounted for the most part by modern brickwork additions. Where  the great Temple of the Sun once stood, the church of Santo Domingo had  been built, a portion of the splendid building of the old faith being  incorporated in it.    \"What is the use of staying here?\" Bertie asked his brother  impatiently, two days after they had arrived at Cuzco. \"I dare say  these old ruins and fortresses, and so on, are very interesting to  people who understand all about the Incas; but as I know nothing about  them, I don't see how you can expect me to get up any interest in an  old wall because you tell me that it is one of the remains of a palace  belonging to some old chap I never heard of. I shall be very glad when  Dias says that the mules have had enough rest and that we can set out  on our business.\"    \"I am afraid you are a Goth, Bert,\" Harry said, looking at him with an  expression of pity. \"Here you are in one of the most interesting cities  of the world, a place that thousands and thousands of people would  travel"]]]
