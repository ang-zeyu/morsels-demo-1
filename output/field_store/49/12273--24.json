'We always spend Sunday afternoon with Father,' said Dora; 'but we  wished to thank you for being so kind as to ask us.'    'And we wished to ask you something else!' said Oswald; and he made  a sign to Alice to get the sherry ready in the glass. She did--behind  Oswald's back while he was speaking.    'My time is limited,' said Mr Mallow, looking at his watch; 'but  still--' Then he muttered something about the fold, and went on: 'Tell  me what is troubling you, my little man, and I will try to give you any  help in my power. What is it you want?'    Then Oswald quickly took the glass from Alice, and held it out to him,  and said, 'I want your opinion on that.'    'On _that_,' he said. 'What is it?'    'It is a shipment,' Oswald said; 'but it's quite enough for you to  taste.' Alice had filled the glass half-full; I suppose she was too  excited to measure properly.    'A shipment?' said the clergyman, taking the glass in his hand.    'Yes,' Oswald went On; 'an exceptional opportunity. Full-bodied and  nutty.'    'It really does taste rather like one kind of Brazil-nut.' Alice put her  oar in as usual.    The Vicar looked from Alice to Oswald, and back again, and Oswald went  on with what he had learned from the printing. The clergyman held the  glass at half-arm's-length, stiffly, as if he had caught cold.    'It is of a quality never before offered at the price. Old Delicate  Amoro--what's its name--'    'Amorolio,' said H. O.    'Amoroso,' said Oswald. 'H. O., you just shut up--Castilian  Amoroso--it's a true after-dinner wine, stimulating and yet...'    '_Wine_?' said Mr Mallow, holding the glass further off. 'Do you  _know_,' he went on, making his voice very thick and strong (I expect he  does it like that in church), 'have you never been _taught_ that it is  the drinking of _wine_ and _spirits_--yes, and _beer_, which makes half  the homes in England full of _wretched_ little children, and _degraded_,  _miserable_ parents?'    'Not if you put sugar in it,' said Alice firmly; 'eight lumps and shake  the bottle. We have each had more than a teaspoonful of it, and we were  not ill at all. It was something else that upset H. O. Most likely all  those acorns he got out of the Park.'    The clergyman seemed to be speechless with conflicting emotions, and  just then the door opened and a lady came in. She had a white cap with  lace, and an ugly violet flower in it, and she was tall, and looked  very strong, though thin. And I do believe she had been listening at the  door.    'But why,' the Vicar was saying, 'why did you bring this dreadful fluid,  this curse of our country, to _me_ to taste?'    'Because we thought you might buy some,' said Dora, who never sees when  a game is up. 'In books the parson loves his bottle of old port; and new  sherry is just as good--with sugar--for people who like sherry. And if  you would order a dozen of the wine, then we should get two shillings.'    The lady said (and it _was_ the voice), 'Good gracious! Nasty, sordid  little things! Haven't they any one to teach them better?'    And Dora got up and said, 'No, we are not those things you say; but we  are sorry we came here to be called names. We want to make our fortune  just as much as Mr Mallow does--only no one would listen to us if we  preached, so it's no use our copying out sermons like him.'    And I think that was smart of Dora, even if it was rather rude.    Then I said perhaps we had better go, and the lady said, 'I should think  so!'    But when we were going to wrap up the bottle and glass the clergyman  said, 'No; you can leave that,' and we were so upset we did, though it  wasn't his after all.    We walked home very fast and not saying much, and the girls went up to  their rooms. When I went to tell them tea was ready, and there was  a teacake, Dora was crying like anything and Alice hugging her. I am  afraid there is a great deal of crying in this chapter, but I can't help  it. Girls will sometimes; I suppose it is their nature, and we ought to  be sorry for their affliction.    'It's no good,' Dora was saying, 'you all hate me, and you think I'm  a prig and a busybody, but I do try to do right--oh, I do! Oswald, go  away; don't come here making fun of me!'    So I said, 'I'm not making fun, Sissy; don't cry, old girl.'    Mother taught me to call her Sissy when we were very little and before  the others came, but I don't often somehow, now we are old. I patted her  on the back, and she put her head against my sleeve, holding on to Alice  all the time, and she went on. She was in that laughy-cryey state when  people say things they wouldn't say at other times.    'Oh dear, oh dear--I do try, I do. And when Mother died she said, \"Dora,  take care of the others, and teach them to be good, and keep them out of  trouble and make them happy.\" She said, \"Take care of them for me, Dora  dear.\" And I have tried, and all of you hate me for it; and to-day I let  you do this, though I knew all the time it was silly.'    I hope you will not think I was a muff but I kissed Dora for some time.  Because girls like it. And I will never say again that she comes the  good elder sister too much. And I have put all this in though I do hate  telling about it, because I own I have been hard on Dora, but I never  will be again. She is a good old sort; of course we never knew before  about what Mother told her, or we wouldn't have ragged her as we did. We  did not tell the little ones, but I got Alice to speak to Dicky, and we  three can sit on the others if requisite.    This made us forget all about the sherry; but about eight o'clock there  was a knock, and Eliza went, and we saw it was poor Jane, if her name  was Jane, from the Vicarage. She handed in a brown-paper parcel and a  letter. And three minutes later Father called us into his study.    On the table was the brown-paper parcel, open, with our bottle and glass  on it, and Father had a letter in his hand. He Pointed to the bottle and  sighed, and said, 'What have you been doing now?' The letter in his hand  was covered with little black writing, all over the four large pages.    So Dicky spoke up, and he told Father the whole thing, as far as he knew  it, for Alice and I had not told about the dead sailors' lady.    And when he had done, Alice said, 'Has Mr Mallow written to you to say  he will buy a dozen of the sherry after all? It is really not half bad  with sugar in it.'    Father said no, he didn't think clergymen could afford such expensive  wine; and he said _he_ would like to taste it. So we gave him what there  was left, for we had decided coming home that we would give up trying  for the two pounds a week in our spare time.    Father tasted it, and then he acted just as H. O. had done when he had  his teaspoonful, but of course we did not say anything. Then he laughed  till I thought he would never stop.    I think it was the sherry, because I am sure I have read somewhere about  'wine that maketh glad the heart of man'. He had only a very little,  which shows that it was a good after-dinner wine, stimulating, and yet  ...I forget the rest.    But when he had done laughing he said, 'It's all right, kids. Only don't  do it again. The wine trade is overcrowded; and besides, I thought you  promised to consult me before going into business?'    'Before buying one I thought you meant,' said Dicky. 'This was only on  commission.' And Father laughed again. I am glad we got the Castilian  Amoroso, because it did really cheer Father up, and you cannot always do  that, however hard you try, even if you make jokes, or give him a comic  paper.        CHAPTER 12. THE NOBLENESS OF OSWALD    The part about his nobleness only comes at the end, but you would  not understand it unless you knew how it began. It began, like nearly  everything about that time, with treasure-seeking.    Of course as soon as we had promised to consult my Father about business  matters we all gave up wanting to go into business. I don't know how it  is, but having to consult about a thing with grown-up people, even  the bravest and the best, seems to make the thing not worth doing  afterwards.    We don't mind Albert's uncle chipping in sometimes when the thing's  going on, but we are glad he never asked us to promise to consult him  about anything. Yet Oswald saw that my Father was quite right; and I  daresay if we had had that hundred pounds we should have spent it on the  share in that lucrative business for the sale of useful patent, and then  found out afterwards that we should have done better to spend the money  in some other way. My Father says so, and he ought to know. We had  several ideas about that time, but having so little chink always stood  in the way.    This was the case with H. O.'s idea of setting up a coconut-shy on this  side of the Heath, where there are none generally. We had no sticks  or wooden balls, and the greengrocer said he could not book so many as  twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastable's written order. And as we did  not wish to consult my Father it was decided to drop it. And when Alice  dressed up Pincher in some of the dolls' clothes and we made up our  minds to take him round with an organ as soon as we had taught him to  dance, we were stopped at once by Dicky's remembering how he had once  heard that an organ cost seven hundred pounds. Of course this was  the big church kind, but even the ones on three legs can't be got for  one-and-sevenpence, which was all we had when we first thought of it. So  we gave that up too.    It was a wet day, I remember, and mutton hash for dinner--very tough  with pale gravy with lumps in it. I think the others would have left a  good deal on the sides of their plates, although they know better, only  Oswald said it was a savoury stew made of the red deer that Edward shot.  So then we were the Children of the New Forest, and the mutton tasted  much better. No "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#18)"],[1,"pped.    \"Yes,\" said Graham. \"Well?\"    The senile voice sank to a confidential whisper, the dim, pale face came  close. \"The real Sleeper--\"    \"Yes,\" said Graham.    \"Died years ago.\"    \"What?\" said Graham, sharply.    \"Years ago. Died. Years ago.\"    \"You don't say so!\" said Graham.    \"I do. I do say so. He died. This Sleeper who's woke up--they changed in  the night. A poor, drugged insensible creature. But I mustn't tell all I  know. I mustn't tell all I know.\"    For a little while he muttered inaudibly. His secret was too much for  him. \"I don't know the ones that put him to sleep--that was before my  time--but I know the man who injected the stimulants and woke him again.  It was ten to one--wake or kill. Wake or kill. Ostrog's way.\"    Graham was so astonished at these things that he had to interrupt, to  make the old man repeat his words, to re-question vaguely, before he was  sure of the meaning and folly of what he heard. And his awakening had  not been natural! Was that an old man's senile superstition, too, or  had it any truth in it? Feeling in the dark corners of his memory, he  presently came on something that might conceivably be an impression of  some such stimulating effect. It dawned upon him that he had happened  upon a lucky encounter, that at last he might learn something of the  new age. The old man wheezed a while and spat, and then the piping,  reminiscent voice resumed:    \"The first time they rejected him. I've followed it all.\"    \"Rejected whom?\" said Graham. \"The Sleeper?\"    \"Sleeper? No. Ostrog. He was terrible--terrible! And he was promised  then, promised certainly the next time. Fools they were--not to be more  afraid of him. Now all the city's his millstone, and such as we dust  ground upon it. Dust ground upon it. Until he set to work--the workers  cut each other's throats, and murdered a Chinaman or a Labour policeman  at times, and left the rest of us in peace. Dead bodies! Robbing!  Darkness! Such a thing hasn't been this gross of years. Eh!--but 'tis  ill on small folks when the great fall out! It's ill.\"    \"Did you say--there had not been what?--for a gross of years?\"    \"Eh?\" said the old man.    The old man said something about clipping his words, and made him repeat  this a third time. \"Fighting and slaying, and weapons in hand, and fools  bawling freedom and the like,\" said the old man. \"Not in all my life has  there been that. These are like the old days--for sure--when the Paris  people broke out--three gross of years ago. That's what I mean hasn't  been. But it's the world's way. It had to come back. I know. I know.  This five years Ostrog has been working, and there has been trouble and  trouble, and hunger and threats and high talk and arms. Blue canvas and  murmurs. No one safe. Everything sliding and slipping. And now here we  are! Revolt and fighting, and the Council come to its end.\"    \"You are rather well-informed on these things,\" said Graham.    \"I know what I hear. It isn't all Babble Machine with me.\"    \"No,\" said Graham, wondering what Babble Machine might be. \"And you are  certain this Ostrog--you are certain Ostrog organised this rebellion and  arranged for the waking of the Sleeper? Just to assert himself--because  he was not elected to the Council?    \"Everyone knows that, I should think,\" said the old man. \"Except--just  fools. He meant to be master somehow. In the Council or not. Everyone  who knows anything knows that. And here we are with dead bodies lying  in the dark! Why, where have you been if you haven't heard all about  the trouble between Ostrog and the Verneys? And what do you think the  troubles are about? The Sleeper? Eh? You think the Sleeper's real and  woke of his own accord--eh?\"    \"I'm a dull man, older than I look, and forgetful,\" said Graham. \"Lots  of things that have happened--especially of late years--. If I was the  Sleeper, to tell you the truth, I couldn't know less about them.\"    \"Eh!\" said the voice. \"Old, are you? You don't sound so very old! But  its not everyone keeps his memory to my time of life--truly. But these  notorious things! But you're not so old as me--not nearly so old as me.  Well! I ought not to judge other men by myself, perhaps. I'm young--for  so old a man. Maybe you're old for so young.\"    \"That's it,\" said Graham. \"And I've a queer history. I know very little.  And history! Practically I know no history. The Sleeper and Julius  Caesar are all the same to me. It's interesting to hear you talk of  these things.\"    \"I know a few things,\" said the old man. \"I know a thing or two. But--.  Hark!\"    The two men became silent, listening. There was heavy thud, a concussion  that made their seat shiver. The passers-by stopped, shouted to one  another. The old man was full of questions; he shouted to a man who  passed near. Graham, emboldened by his example, got up and accosted  others. None knew what had happened.    He returned to the seat and found the old man muttering vague  interrogations in an undertone. For a while they said nothing to one  another.    The sense of this gigantic struggle, so near and yet so remote oppressed  Graham's imagination. Was this old man right, was the report of the  people right, and were the revolutionaries winning? Or were they all in  error, and were the red guards driving all before them? At any time the  flood of warfare might pour into this silent quarter of the city and  seize upon him again. It behooved him to learn all he could while there  was time. He turned suddenly to the old man with a question and left it  unsaid. But his motion moved the old man to speech again.    \"Eh! but how things work together!\" said the old man. \"This Sleeper that  all the fools put their trust in! I've the whole history of it--I was  always a good one for histories. When I was a boy--I'm that old--I  used to read printed books. You'd hardly think it. Likely you've seen  none--they rot and dust so--and the Sanitary Company burns them to make  ashlarite. But they were convenient in their dirty way. Oh I learnt a  lot. These new-fangled Babble Machines--they don't seem new-fangled to  you, eh?--they're easy to hear, easy to forget. But I've traced all the  Sleeper business from the first.\"      \"You will scarcely believe it,\" said Graham slowly, \"I'm so  ignorant--I've been so preoccupied in my own little affairs, my  circumstances have been so odd--I know nothing of this Sleeper's  history. Who was he?\"    \"Eh!\" said the old man. \"I know. I know. He was a poor nobody, and set  on a playful woman, poor soul! And he fell into a trance. There's the  old things they had, those brown things--silver photographs--still  showing him as he lay, a gross and a half years ago--a gross and a half  of years.\"    \"Set on a playful woman, poor soul,\" said Graham softly to himself, and  then aloud, \"Yes--well! go on.\"    \"You must know he had a cousin named Warming a solitary man without  children, who made a big fortune speculating in roads--the first  Eadhamite roads. But surely you've heard? No? Why? He bought all the  patent rights and made a big company. In those days there were grosses  of grosses of separate businesses and business companies. Grosses of  grosses! His roads killed the railroads--the old things--in two dozen  years; he bought up and Eadhamited the tracks. And because he didn't  want to break up his great property or let in shareholders, he left it  all to the Sleeper, and put it under a Board of Trustees that he had  picked and trained. He knew then the Sleeper wouldn't wake, that he  would go on sleeping, sleeping till he died. He knew that quite well!  And plump! a man in the United States, who had lost two sons in a boat  accident, followed that up with another great bequest. His trustees  found themselves with a dozen myriads of lions'-worth or more of  property at the very beginning.\"    \"What was his name?\"    \"Graham.\"    \"No, I mean--that American's.\"    \"Isbister.\"    \"Isbister!\" cried Graham. \"Why, I don't even know the name.\"    \"Of course not,\" said the old man. \"Of course not. People don't learn  much in the schools nowadays. But I know all about him. He was a rich  American who went from England, and he left the Sleeper even more than  Warming. How he made it? That I don't know. Something about pictures by  machinery. But he made it and left it, and so the Council had its start.  It was just a council of trustees at first.\"    \"And how did it grow?\"    \"Eh!--but you're not up to things. Money attracts money--and twelve  brains are better than one. They played it cleverly. They worked  politics with money, and kept on adding to the money by working currency  and tariffs. They grew--they grew. And for years the twelve trustees  hid the growing of the Sleeper's estate, under double names and company  titles and all that. The Council spread by title deed, mortgage, share,  every political party, every newspaper, they bought. If you listen to  the old stories you will see the Council growing and growing. Billions  and billions of lions at last--the Sleeper's estate. And all growing  out of a whim--out of this Warming's will, and an accident to Isbister's  sons.    \"Men are strange,\" said the old man. \"The strange, thing to me is how  the Council worked together so long. As many as twelve. But they worked  in cliques from the first. And they've slipped back. In my young days  speaking of the Council was like an ignorant man speaking of God. We  didn't think they could do wrong. We didn't know of their women and all  that! Or else I've got wiser.    \"Men are strange,\" said the old man. \"Here are you, young and  ignorant, and me--sevendy years old, and I might reasonably be  forgetting--explaining it all to you short and clear.    \"Sevendy,\" he said, \"sevendy, and I hear and see--hear better than I  see. And reason clearly, and keep myself up to all the happenings of  things. Sevendy!    \"Life is strange. I was twaindy before Ostrog was a baby. I remember him"]]]
