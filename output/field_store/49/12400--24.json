Instead of a butterfly looking like a  stone, here is a stone looking like a butterfly!\" Once something hovered  and fluttered round his head, but by an effort of will he drove that  impression out of his mind again.    In the afternoon Hapley called upon the Vicar, and argued with him upon  theological questions. They sat in the little arbour covered with briar,  and smoked as they wrangled. \"Look at that moth!\" said Hapley, suddenly,  pointing to the edge of the wooden table.    \"Where?\" said the Vicar.    \"You don't see a moth on the edge of the table there?\" said Hapley.    \"Certainly not,\" said the Vicar.    Hapley was thunderstruck. He gasped. The Vicar was staring at him. Clearly  the man saw nothing. \"The eye of faith is no better than the eye of  science,\" said Hapley awkwardly.    \"I don't see your point,\" said the Vicar, thinking it was part of the  argument.    That night Hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane. He sat on  the edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself. Was it  pure hallucination? He knew he was slipping, and he battled for his sanity  with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against Pawkins. So  persistent is mental habit, that he felt as if it were still a struggle  with Pawkins. He was well versed in psychology. He knew that such visual  illusions do come as a result of mental strain. But the point was, he did  not only _see_ the moth, he had heard it when it touched the edge of  the lampshade, and afterwards when it hit against the wall, and he had  felt it strike his face in the dark.    He looked at it. It was not at all dreamlike, but perfectly clear and  solid-looking in the candle-light. He saw the hairy body, and the short  feathery antennae, the jointed legs, even a place where the down was  rubbed from the wing. He suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid  of a little insect.    His landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night, because she  was afraid to be alone. In addition she had locked the door, and put the  chest of drawers against it. They listened and talked in whispers after  they had gone to bed, but nothing occurred to alarm them. About eleven  they had ventured to put the candle out, and had both dozed off to sleep.  They woke up with a start, and sat up in bed, listening in the darkness.    Then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in Hapley's room. A chair  was overturned, and there was a violent dab at the wall. Then a china  mantel ornament smashed upon the fender. Suddenly the door of the room  opened, and they heard him upon the landing. They clung to one another,  listening. He seemed to be dancing upon the staircase. Now he would go  down three or four steps quickly, then up again, then hurry down into the  hall. They heard the umbrella stand go over, and the fanlight break. Then  the bolt shot and the chain rattled. He was opening the door.    They hurried to the window. It was a dim grey night; an almost unbroken  sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon, and the hedge and  trees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway. They saw  Hapley, looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers, running to  and fro in the road, and beating the air. Now he would stop, now he would  dart very rapidly at something invisible, now he would move upon it with  stealthy strides. At last he went out of sight up the road towards the  down. Then, while they argued who should go down and lock the door, he  returned. He was walking very fast, and he came straight into the house,  closed the door carefully, and went quietly up to his bedroom. Then  everything was silent.    \"Mrs. Colville,\" said Hapley, calling down the staircase next morning, \"I  hope I did not alarm you last night.\"    \"You may well ask that!\" said Mrs. Colville.    \"The fact is, I am a sleep-walker, and the last two nights I have been  without my sleeping mixture. There is nothing to be alarmed about, really.  I am sorry I made such an ass of myself. I will go over the down to  Shoreham, and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly. I ought to have  done that yesterday.\"    But half-way over the down, by the chalk pits, the moth came upon Hapley  again. He went on, trying to keep his mind upon chess problems, but it was  no good. The thing fluttered into his face, and he struck at it with his  hat in self-defence. Then rage, the old rage--the rage he had so often  felt against Pawkins--came upon him again. He went on, leaping and  striking at the eddying insect. Suddenly he trod on nothing, and fell  headlong.    There was a gap in his sensations, and Hapley found himself sitting on the  heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalk-pits, with a leg  twisted back under him. The strange moth was still fluttering round his  head. He struck at it with his hand, and turning his head saw two men  approaching him. One was the village doctor. It occurred to Hapley that  this was lucky. Then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness,  that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself, and  that it behoved him to keep silent about it.    Late that night, however, after his broken leg was set, he was feverish  and forgot his self-restraint. He was lying flat on his bed, and he began  to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about. He  tried not to do this, but it was no good. He soon caught sight of the  thing resting close to his hand, by the night-light, on the green  table-cloth. The wings quivered. With a sudden wave of anger he smote at  it with his fist, and the nurse woke up with a shriek. He had missed it.    \"That moth!\" he said; and then, \"It was fancy. Nothing!\"    All the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice  and darting across the room, and he could also see that the nurse saw  nothing of it and looked at him strangely. He must keep himself in hand.  He knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand. But as the  night waned the fever grew upon him, and the very dread he had of seeing  the moth made him see it. About five, just as the dawn was grey, he tried  to get out of bed and catch it, though his leg was afire with pain. The  nurse had to struggle with him.    On account of this, they tied him down to the bed. At this the moth grew  bolder, and once he felt it settle in his hair. Then, because he struck  out violently with his arms, they tied these also. At this the moth came  and crawled over his face, and Hapley wept, swore, screamed, prayed for  them to take it off him, unavailingly.    The doctor was a blockhead, a just-qualified general practitioner, and  quite ignorant of mental science. He simply said there was no moth. Had he  possessed the wit, he might still, perhaps, have saved Hapley from his  fate by entering into his delusion, and covering his face with gauze, as  he prayed might be done. But, as I say, the doctor was a blockhead, and  until the leg was healed Hapley was kept tied to his bed, and with the  imaginary moth crawling over him. It never left him while he was awake and  it grew to a monster in his dreams. While he was awake he longed for  sleep, and from sleep he awoke screaming.    So now Hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room,  worried by a moth that no one else can see. The asylum doctor calls it  hallucination; but Hapley, when he is in his easier mood, and can talk,  says it is the ghost of Pawkins, and consequently a unique specimen and  well worth the trouble of catching.            X.      THE TREASURE IN THE FOREST.      The canoe was now approaching the land. The bay opened out, and a gap in  the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the  sea; the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course  down the distant hill slope. The forest here came close to the beach. Far  beyond, dim and almost cloudlike in texture, rose the mountains, like  suddenly frozen waves. The sea was still save for an almost imperceptible  swell. The sky blazed.    The man with the carved paddle stopped. \"It should be somewhere here,\" he  said. He shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him.    The other man had been in the fore part of the canoe, closely scrutinising  the land. He had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee.    \"Come and look at this, Evans,\" he said.    Both men spoke in low tones, and their lips were hard and dry.    The man called Evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over  his companion's shoulder.    The paper had the appearance of a rough map. By much folding it was  creased and worn to the pitch of separation, and the second man held the  discoloured fragments together where they had parted. On it one could  dimly make out, in almost obliterated pencil, the outline of the bay.    \"Here,\" said Evans, \"is the reef, and here is the gap.\" He ran his  thumb-nail over the chart.    \"This curved and twisting line is the river--I could do with a drink  now!--and this star is the place.\"    \"You see this dotted line,\" said the man with the map; \"it is a straight  line, and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm-trees. The  star comes just where it cuts the river. We must mark the place as we go  into the lagoon.\"    \"It's queer,\" said Evans, after a pause, \"what these little marks down  here are for. It looks like the plan of a house or something; but what all  these little dashes, pointing this way and that, may mean I can't get a  notion. And what's the writing?\"    \"Chinese,\" said the man with the map.    \"Of course! _He_ was a Chinee,\" said Evans.    \"They all were,\" said the man with the map.    They both sat for some minutes staring at the land, while the canoe  drifted slowly. Then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#19)"],[1,"I went to lunch.  He must have crept  in and stolen it.  Doubtless he thinks that it, too, is full of  treasure.\"    \"He does!\"    \"How on earth do you know?\" asked Adam.    \"A little while ago he offered to give it to me--another bribe to accept  him.  Faugh!  I am ashamed to tell you such a thing.  The beast!\"    Whilst they had been speaking, she had opened the door, a narrow iron  one, well hung, for it opened easily and closed tightly without any  creaking or sound of any kind.  Within all was dark; but she entered as  freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it had been broad  daylight.  For Adam, there was just sufficient green light from somewhere  for him to see that there was a broad flight of heavy stone steps leading  upward; but Lady Arabella, after shutting the door behind her, when it  closed tightly without a clang, tripped up the steps lightly and swiftly.  For an instant all was dark, but there came again the faint green light  which enabled him to see the outlines of things.  Another iron door,  narrow like the first and fairly high, led into another large room, the  walls of which were of massive stones, so closely joined together as to  exhibit only one smooth surface.  This presented the appearance of having  at one time been polished.  On the far side, also smooth like the walls,  was the reverse of a wide, but not high, iron door.  Here there was a  little more light, for the high-up aperture over the door opened to the  air.    Lady Arabella took from her girdle another small key, which she inserted  in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock.  The great bolt seemed  wonderfully hung, for the moment the small key was turned, the bolts of  the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron doors swung open.  On the  stone steps outside stood Oolanga, with the mongoose box slung over his  shoulder.  Lady Arabella stood a little on one side, and the African,  accepting the movement as an invitation, entered in an obsequious way.  The moment, however, that he was inside, he gave a quick look around him.    \"Much death here--big death.  Many deaths.  Good, good!\"    He sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent.  The matter and manner  of his speech were so revolting that instinctively Adam's hand wandered  to his revolver, and, with his finger on the trigger, he rested satisfied  that he was ready for any emergency.    There was certainly opportunity for the nigger's enjoyment, for the open  well-hole was almost under his nose, sending up such a stench as almost  made Adam sick, though Lady Arabella seemed not to mind it at all.  It  was like nothing that Adam had ever met with.  He compared it with all  the noxious experiences he had ever had--the drainage of war hospitals,  of slaughter-houses, the refuse of dissecting rooms.  None of these was  like it, though it had something of them all, with, added, the sourness  of chemical waste and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water-  logged ship whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned.    Then, quite unexpectedly, the negro noticed the presence of a third  person--Adam Salton!  He pulled out a pistol and shot at him, happily  missing.  Adam was himself usually a quick shot, but this time his mind  had been on something else and he was not ready.  However, he was quick  to carry out an intention, and he was not a coward.  In another moment  both men were in grips.  Beside them was the dark well-hole, with that  horrid effluvium stealing up from its mysterious depths.    Adam and Oolanga both had pistols; Lady Arabella, who had not one, was  probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting, but that  being impossible, she made her effort in another way.  Gliding forward,  she tried to seize the African; but he eluded her grasp, just missing, in  doing so, falling into the mysterious hole.  As he swayed back to firm  foothold, he turned his own gun on her and shot.  Instinctively Adam  leaped at his assailant; clutching at each other, they tottered on the  very brink.    Lady Arabella's anger, now fully awake, was all for Oolanga.  She moved  towards him with her hands extended, and had just seized him when the  catch of the locked box--due to some movement from within--flew open, and  the king-cobra-killer flew at her with a venomous fury impossible to  describe.  As it seized her throat, she caught hold of it, and, with a  fury superior to its own, tore it in two just as if it had been a sheet  of paper.  The strength used for such an act must have been terrific.  In  an instant, it seemed to spout blood and entrails, and was hurled into  the well-hole.  In another instant she had seized Oolanga, and with a  swift rush had drawn him, her white arms encircling him, down with her  into the gaping aperture.    Adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling circle, and  as it sank down into the well, a pair of blazing green eyes became fixed,  sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity, and disappeared, throwing  upward the green light which grew more and more vivid every moment.  As  the light sank into the noisome depths, there came a shriek which chilled  Adam's blood--a prolonged agony of pain and terror which seemed to have  no end.    Adam Salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from the  memory of those dreadful moments.  The gloom which surrounded that  horrible charnel pit, which seemed to go down to the very bowels of the  earth, conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of the nethermost  hell.  The ghastly fate of the African as he sank down to his terrible  doom, his black face growing grey with terror, his white eyeballs, now  like veined bloodstone, rolling in the helpless extremity of fear.  The  mysterious green light was in itself a milieu of horror.  And through it  all the awful cry came up from that fathomless pit, whose entrance was  flooded with spots of fresh blood.  Even the death of the fearless little  snake-killer--so fierce, so frightful, as if stained with a ferocity  which told of no living force above earth, but only of the devils of the  pit--was only an incident.  Adam was in a state of intellectual tumult,  which had no parallel in his experience.  He tried to rush away from the  horrible place; even the baleful green light, thrown up through the  gloomy well-shaft, was dying away as its source sank deeper into the  primeval ooze.  The darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming  density--darkness in such a place and with such a memory of it!    He made a wild rush forward--slipt on the steps in some sticky, acrid-  smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood, and, falling forward, felt  his way into the inner room, where the well-shaft was not.    Then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement.  Up the stone steps from the  narrow door by which he had entered, glided the white-clad figure of Lady  Arabella, the only colour to be seen on her being blood-marks on her face  and hands and throat.  Otherwise, she was calm and unruffled, as when  earlier she stood aside for him to pass in through the narrow iron door.          CHAPTER XIX--AN ENEMY IN THE DARK      Adam Salton went for a walk before returning to Lesser Hill; he felt that  it might be well, not only to steady his nerves, shaken by the horrible  scene, but to get his thoughts into some sort of order, so as to be ready  to enter on the matter with Sir Nathaniel.  He was a little embarrassed  as to telling his uncle, for affairs had so vastly progressed beyond his  original view that he felt a little doubtful as to what would be the old  gentleman's attitude when he should hear of the strange events for the  first time.  Mr. Salton would certainly not be satisfied at being treated  as an outsider with regard to such things, most of which had points of  contact with the inmates of his own house.  It was with an immense sense  of relief that Adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the  housekeeper that he was detained by business at Walsall, where he would  remain for the night; and that he would be back in the morning in time  for lunch.    When Adam got home after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel just going to  bed.  He did not say anything to him then of what had happened, but  contented himself with arranging that they would walk together in the  early morning, as he had much to say that would require serious  attention.    Strangely enough he slept well, and awoke at dawn with his mind clear and  his nerves in their usual unshaken condition.  The maid brought up, with  his early morning cup of tea, a note which had been found in the letter-  box.  It was from Lady Arabella, and was evidently intended to put him on  his guard as to what he should say about the previous evening.    He read it over carefully several times, before he was satisfied that he  had taken in its full import.       \"DEAR MR. SALTON,       \"I cannot go to bed until I have written to you, so you must forgive     me if I disturb you, and at an unseemly time.  Indeed, you must also     forgive me if, in trying to do what is right, I err in saying too much     or too little.  The fact is that I am quite upset and unnerved by all     that has happened in this terrible night.  I find it difficult even to     write; my hands shake so that they are not under control, and I am     trembling all over with memory of the horrors we saw enacted before     our eyes.  I am grieved beyond measure that I should be, however     remotely, a cause of this horror coming on you.  Forgive me if you     can, and do not think too hardly of me.  This I ask with confidence,     for since we shared together the danger--the very pangs--of death, I     feel that we should be to one another something more than mere     friends, that I may lean on you and trust you, assured that your     sympathy and pity are for me.  You really must let me thank you for     the friendliness, the help, the confidence, the real aid at a time "]]]
