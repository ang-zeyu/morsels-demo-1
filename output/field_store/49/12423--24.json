But the future of the  American nation was still uncertain. Indeed, one can hardly say that  there was an American nation in 1783. While the war lasted, a sense of  danger bound together the people of the different states. But as soon as  this peril ceased, their old jealousies and self-seekings came back.  There was no national government to smooth over these differences and to  compel the states to act justly toward one another. There was, indeed,  the Congress of the Confederation, but it is absurd to speak of it as a  national government.    [Sidenote: Formation of the Articles of Confederation.]    [Sidenote: Weakness of the Confederation. _McMaster_, 163.]    168. The Articles of Confederation, 1781.--The Continental Congress  began drawing up the Articles of Confederation in June, 1776. But there  were long delays, and each month's delay made it more impossible to form  a strong government. It fell out in this way that the Congress of the  Confederation had no real power. It could not make a state or an  individual pay money or do anything at all. In the course of a few years  Congress asked the states to give it over six million dollars to pay the  debts and expenses of the United States. It received about a million  dollars and was fortunate to get that.    [Sidenote: Distress among the people.]    169. A Time of Distress.--It is not right to speak too harshly of  the refusal of the state governments to give Congress the money it asked  for, as the people of the states were in great distress and had no money  to give. As soon as peace was declared British merchants sent over great  quantities of goods. People bought these goods, for every one thought  that good times were coming now that the war was over. But the British  government did everything it could do to prevent the coming of good  times. The prosperity of the northern states was largely based on a  profitable trade with the West Indies. The British government put an end  to that trade. No gold and silver came to the United States from the  West Indies while gold and silver constantly went out of the country to  pay debts due to British merchants. Soon gold and silver grew scarce,  and those who had any promptly hid it. The real reason of all this  trouble was the lack of a strong national government which could have  compelled the British government to open its ports to American commerce.  But the people only saw that money was scarce and called upon the state  legislatures to give them paper money.    [Sidenote: Paper money.]    170. Paper Money.--Most of the state legislatures did what they  were asked to do. They printed quantities of paper money. They paid the  public expenses with it, and sometimes lent it to individuals without  much security for its repayment. Before long this paper money began to  grow less valuable. For instance, on a certain day a man could buy a bag  of flour for five dollars. In three months' time a bag of flour might  cost him ten dollars. Soon it became difficult to buy flour for any  number of paper dollars.    [Sidenote: Tender laws.]    171 Tender Laws.--The people then clamored for \"tender laws.\" These  were laws which would make it lawful for them to tender, or offer, paper  money in exchange for flour or other things. In some cases it was made  lawful to tender paper money in payments of debts which had been made  when gold and silver were still in use. The merchants now shut up their  shops, and business almost ceased. The lawyers only were busy. For those  to whom money was owed tried to get it paid before the paper money  became utterly worthless. The courts were crowded, and the prisons were  filled with poor debtors.    [Sidenote: Stay laws.]    172. Stay Laws.--Now the cry was for \"stay laws.\" These were laws  to prevent those to whom money was due from enforcing their rights.  These laws promptly put an end to whatever business was left. The only  way that any business could be carried on was by barter. For example, a  man who had a bushel of wheat that he did not want for his family would  exchange it for three or four bushels of potatoes, or for four or five  days of labor. In some states the legislatures passed very severe laws  to compel people to receive paper money. In one state, indeed, no one  could vote who would not receive paper money.    [Illustration: STATE STREET, BOSTON, ABOUT 1790. The Boston Massacre  occurred near where the two-horse wagon stands.]    [Sidenote: Disorder in Massachusetts.]    173. Shays's Rebellion, 1786-87.--In Massachusetts, especially, the  discontent was very great. The people were angry with the judges for  sending men to prison who did not pay their debts. Crowds of armed men  visited the judges and compelled them to close the courts. The leader in  this movement was Daniel Shays. He even threatened to seize the United  States Arsenal at Springfield. By this time Governor Bowdoin and General  Lincoln also had gathered a small force of soldiers. In the midst of  winter, through snowstorms and over terrible roads, Lincoln marched with  his men. He drove Shays from place to place, captured his followers, and  put down the rebellion. There were risings in other states, especially  in North Carolina. But Shays's Rebellion in Massachusetts was the most  important of them all, because it convinced the New Englanders that a  stronger national government was necessary.

Claims to Western Lands.--The Confederation seemed to be  falling to pieces. That it did not actually fall to pieces was largely  due to the fact that all the states were interested in the settlement of  the region northwest of the Ohio River. It will be well to stop a moment  and see how this came about. Under their old charters Massachusetts,  Connecticut, Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia had claims to lands west of  the Alleghanies. Between 1763 and 1776 the British government had paid  slight heed to these claims (pp. 75, 89). But Daniel Boone and other  colonists had settled west of the mountains in what are now the states  of Kentucky and Tennessee. When the Revolution began the states having  claims to western lands at once put them forward, and New York also  claimed a right to about one-half of the disputed territory. Naturally,  the states that had no claims to these lands had quite different views.  The Marylanders, for example, thought that the western lands should be  regarded as national territory and used for the common benefit. Maryland  refused to join the Confederation until New York had ceded her claims to  the United States, and Virginia had proposed a cession of the territory  claimed by her.    [Sidenote: The states cede their claims to the United States.  _McMaster_, 159-160.]    175. The Land Cessions.--In 1784 Virginia gave up her claims to the  land northwest of the Ohio River with the exception of certain large  tracts which she reserved for her veteran soldiers. Massachusetts ceded  her claims in 1785. The next year (1786) Connecticut gave up her claims.  But she reserved a large tract of land directly west of Pennsylvania.  This was called the Connecticut Reserve or, more often, the Western  Reserve. South Carolina and North Carolina ceded their lands in 1787 and  1790, and finally Georgia gave up her claims to western lands in 1802.    [Sidenote: Reasons for the ordinance.]    [Sidenote:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12426"],[0,"Routledge's Manual of Etiquette (#19)"],[1,"to dance without a knowledge of dancing is not only to make  one's self ridiculous, but one's partner also. No lady or gentleman  has the right to place a partner in this absurd position.    Never forget a ball-room engagement. To do so is to commit an  unpardonable offence against good breeding.    It is not necessary that a lady or gentleman should be acquainted  with the _steps_, in order to walk gracefully and easily through a  quadrille. An easy carriage and a knowledge of the figure is all  that is requisite. A round dance, however, should on no account be  attempted without a thorough knowledge of the steps, and some previous  practice.    No person who has not a good ear for time and tune need hope to dance  well.    At the conclusion of a dance, the gentleman bows to his partner, and  either promenades with her round the room, or takes her to a seat.  Where a room is set apart for refreshments, he offers to conduct her  thither. At a public hall no gentleman would, of course, permit a lady  to pay for refreshments.    No lady should accept refreshments from a stranger at a public ball;  for she would thereby lay herself under a pecuniary obligation. For  these she must rely on her father, brothers, or old friends.    Good taste forbids that a lady and gentleman should dance too  frequently together at either a public or private ball. Engaged  persons should be careful not to commit this conspicuous solecism.    Engagements for one dance should not be made while the present dance  is yet in progress.    If a lady happens to forget a previous engagement, and stand up with  another partner, the gentleman whom she has thus slighted is bound to  believe that she has acted from mere inadvertence, and should by  no means suffer his pride to master his good temper. To cause a  disagreeable scene in a private ball-room is to affront your host and  hostess, and to make yourself absurd. In a public room it is no less  reprehensible. Always remember that good breeding and good temper (or  the appearance of good temper) are inseparably connected.    Young gentlemen are earnestly advised not to limit their conversation  to remarks on the weather and the heat of the room. It is, to a  certain extent, incumbent on them to do something more than dance when  they invite a lady to join a quadrille. If it be only upon the news  of the day, a gentleman should be able to offer at least three or four  observations to his partner in the course of a long half-hour.    Gentlemen who dance cannot be too careful not to injure the dresses of  the ladies who do them the honour to stand up with them. The young men  of the present day are singularly careless in this respect; and when  they have torn a lady's delicate skirt, appear to think the mischief  they have done scarcely worth the trouble of an apology.    A gentleman conducts his last partner to the supper-room, and, having  waited upon her while there, re-conducts her to the ball-room. Never  attempt to take a place in a dance which has been previously engaged.    Withdraw from a private ball-room as quietly as possible, so that your  departure may not be observed by others, and cause the party to break  up. If you meet the lady of the house on her way out, take your leave  of her in such a manner that her other guests may not suppose you are  doing so; but do not seek her out for that purpose.    Never be seen without gloves in a ball-room, though it were only for  a few moments. Those who dance much and are particularly _soigne_  in matters relating to the toilette, take a second pair of gloves to  replace the first when soiled.    A thoughtful hostess will never introduce a bad dancer to a good  one, because she has no right to punish one friend in order to oblige  another.    It is not customary for married persons to dance together in society.    [Footnote A: See \"Etiquette for Ladies,\" and \"Etiquette for  Gentlemen,\" Sec. IX.]           *       *       *       *       *    IV.--THE QUADRILLE.      The Quadrille is the most universal, as it is certainly the  most sociable, of all fashionable dances. It admits of pleasant  conversation, frequent interchange of partners, and is adapted to  every age. The young or old, the ponderous _paterfamilias_ or his  sylph-like daughter, may with equal propriety take part in its easy  and elegant figures. Even an occasional blunder is of less consequence  in this dance than in many others; for each personage is in some  degree free as to his own movements, not being compelled by the  continual embrace of his partner to dance either better or worse than  he may find convenient.    People now generally walk through a quadrille. Nothing more than a  perfect knowledge of the figure, a graceful demeanour, and a correct  ear for the time of the music are requisite to enable any one to take  a creditable part in this dance. Steps are quite gone out of fashion:  even the _chasse_ has been given up for some time past.    A quadrille must always consist of five parts. If a variation be  made in the fourth figure, by the substitution of _Pastorale_ for  _Trenise_, the latter must then be omitted; or _vice-versa_. As soon  as a gentleman has engaged his partner for the quadrille, he should  endeavour to secure as his _vis-a-vis_ some friend or acquaintance;  and should then lead his partner to the top of the quadrille, provided  that post of honour be still vacant. He will place the lady always at  his right hand.    Quadrille music is divided into eight bars for each part of the  figure; two steps should be taken in every bar; every movement thus  invariably consists of eight or of four steps.    It is well not to learn too many new figures; the memory is liable to  become confused amongst them; besides which, it is doubtful whether  your partner, or your _vis-a-vis_, is as learned in the matter as  yourself. Masters are extremely fond of inventing and teaching new  figures; but you will do well to confine your attention to a few  simple and universally received sets, which you will find quite  sufficient for your purpose. We begin with the oldest and most common,  the    FIRST SET OF QUADRILLES.      First Figure.--Le Pantalon.    The couples at the top and bottom of the quadrille cross to each  other's places in eight steps, occupying four bars of the time; then  re-cross immediately to their own places, which completes the movement  of eight bars. This is called the _Chaine Anglaise_. The gentleman  always keeps to the right of _vis-a-vis_ lady in crossing, thus  placing her _inside_.    Set to partners, or _balances_; turn your partners. (This occupies the  second eight bars.) Ladies, chain, or _chaine des dames_. (Eight  bars more.) Each couple crosses to opposite couple's place, gentleman  giving his hand to his partner: this is called half-promenade. Couples  recross right and left to their places, without giving hands, which  completes another eight bars, and ends the figure.    The side couples repeat what the top and bottom couples have done.      Second Figure.--L'Ete    The ladies in all the top couples, and their _vis-a-vis_ gentlemen,  advance four steps, and retire the same, repeating this movement once  again, which makes the first eight bars.    Top ladies and _vis-a-vis_ gentlemen cross to each other's places;  advance four steps; retreat ditto; cross back towards partners, who  set to them as they advance; turn partners; which ends first half of  figure.    Second ladies and top _vis-a-vis_ gentlemen execute the same  movements. Then side couples begin, the privilege of commencement  being conferred on those ladies who stand at the _right_ of the top  couples.    This figure is sometimes performed in a different manner, known as  double _L'Ete_. Instead of the top lady and _vis-a-vis_ gentleman  advancing alone, they advance with partners joining hands; cross and  return, as in the single figure. This variation is, however, somewhat  out of vogue, except (as will presently be seen) in the last figure of  the quadrille, where it is still frequently introduced.      Third Figure--La Poule.    Top lady and _vis-a-vis_ gentleman cross to each other's places,  giving right hand in passing; cross back again with left hand. (Eight  bars.) The two couples form in a line, and join hands, the left hand  of one holding the right hand of his or her neighbour, so that each  faces different ways; in this position all four _balancez_, then half  promenade with partner to opposite place; top lady and _vis-a-vis_  gentleman advance four steps and retire ditto. (2nd eight bars.) Both  top and bottom couples advance together, and retire the same; then  re-cross right and left to places. (3rd eight bars.) Second lady and  first opposite gentleman repeat figure. Side couples repeat, observing  same rule for commencement as in _L'Ete_.      Fourth Figure.--La Trenise.    Top couples join hands, advance four steps and retreat ditto: advance  again, gentleman leaving lady at left hand of _vis-a-vis_ gentleman,  and retiring alone, (1st eight bars.) Two ladies advance, crossing  to opposite side; gentleman advances to meet his partner, _vis-a-vis_  lady returns to hers. (2nd eight bars.) _Balancez_; turn partners to  places. (3rd eight bars.) Second couple performs same figure; side  couples repeat as before.    If _La Pastorale_ be preferred, it will be performed thus:--Top couple  advance and retreat; advance, gentleman leading lady to left hand  of _vis-a-vis_ gentleman; he advances with both ladies four steps,  retreating ditto; again advancing, he leaves both ladies with first  gentleman, retreating alone; top gentleman and both ladies advance and  retreat; again advance, joining hands in circle, go half round, half  promenade to opposite places, then return right and left to their own.  Second couples and side couples repeat as before.      Fifth Figure.--La Finale.    Begin with the _grand rond_ or great round; that is, the whole"]]]
