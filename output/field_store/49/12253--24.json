You started to tell her a funny story just as she was  making her eleventh shot to get her ball out of this ravine, and she  took what she considered the necessary steps.\"    \"Can you ever forgive me, George?\" cried Celia.    George Mackintosh stared at me. Then a crimson blush mantled his face.    \"So I did! It's all beginning to come back to me. Oh, heavens!\"    \"_Can_ you forgive me, George?\" cried Celia again.    He took her hand in his.    \"Forgive you?\" he muttered. \"Can _you_ forgive _me?_ Me--a  tee-talker, a green-gabbler, a prattler on the links, the lowest form  of life known to science! I am unclean, unclean!\"    \"It's only a little mud, dearest,\" said Celia, looking at the sleeve of  his coat. \"It will brush off when it's dry.\"    \"How can you link your lot with a man who talks when people are making  their shots?\"    \"You will never do it again.\"    \"But I have done it. And you stuck to me all through! Oh, Celia!\"    \"I loved you, George!\"    The man seemed to swell with a sudden emotion. His eye lit up, and he  thrust one hand into the breast of his coat while he raised the other  in a sweeping gesture. For an instant he appeared on the verge of a  flood of eloquence. And then, as if he had been made sharply aware of  what it was that he intended to do, he suddenly sagged. The gleam died  out of his eyes. He lowered his hand.    \"Well, I must say that was rather decent of you,\" he said.    A lame speech, but one that brought an infinite joy to both his  hearers. For it showed that George Mackintosh was cured beyond  possibility of relapse.    \"Yes, I must say you are rather a corker,\" he added.    \"George!\" cried Celia.    I said nothing, but I clasped his hand; and then, taking my clubs, I  retired. When I looked round she was still in his arms. I left them  there, alone together in the great silence.           *       *       *       *       *    And so (concluded the Oldest Member) you see that a cure is possible,  though it needs a woman's gentle hand to bring it about. And how few  women are capable of doing what Celia Tennant did. Apart from the  difficulty of summoning up the necessary resolution, an act like hers  requires a straight eye and a pair of strong and supple wrists. It  seems to me that for the ordinary talking golfer there is no hope. And  the race seems to be getting more numerous every day. Yet the finest  golfers are always the least loquacious. It is related of the  illustrious Sandy McHoots that when, on the occasion of his winning the  British Open Championship, he was interviewed by reporters from the  leading daily papers as to his views on Tariff Reform, Bimetallism, the  Trial by Jury System, and the Modern Craze for Dancing, all they could  extract from him was the single word \"Mphm!\" Having uttered which, he  shouldered his bag and went home to tea. A great man. I wish there were  more like him.          6    _Ordeal By Golf_      A pleasant breeze played among the trees on the terrace outside the  Marvis Bay Golf and Country Club. It ruffled the leaves and cooled the  forehead of the Oldest Member, who, as was his custom of a Saturday  afternoon, sat in the shade on a rocking-chair, observing the younger  generation as it hooked and sliced in the valley below. The eye of the  Oldest Member was thoughtful and reflective. When it looked into yours  you saw in it that perfect peace, that peace beyond understanding,  which comes at its maximum only to the man who has given up golf.    The Oldest Member has not played golf since the rubber-cored ball  superseded the old dignified gutty. But as a spectator and philosopher  he still finds pleasure in the pastime. He is watching it now with keen  interest. His gaze, passing from the lemonade which he is sucking  through a straw, rests upon the Saturday foursome which is struggling  raggedly up the hill to the ninth green. Like all Saturday foursomes,  it is in difficulties. One of the patients is zigzagging about the  fairway like a liner pursued by submarines. Two others seem to be  digging for buried treasure, unless--it is too far off to be  certain--they are killing snakes. The remaining cripple, who has just  foozled a mashie-shot, is blaming his caddie. His voice, as he upbraids  the innocent child for breathing during his up-swing, comes clearly up  the hill.    The Oldest Member sighs. His lemonade gives a sympathetic gurgle. He  puts it down on the table.           *       *       *       *       *    How few men, says the Oldest Member, possess the proper golfing  temperament! How few indeed, judging by the sights I see here on  Saturday afternoons, possess any qualification at all for golf except a  pair of baggy knickerbockers and enough money to enable them to pay for  the drinks at the end of the round. The ideal golfer never loses his  temper. When I played, I never lost my temper. Sometimes, it is true, I  may, after missing a shot, have broken my club across my knees; but I  did it in a calm and judicial spirit, because the club was obviously no  good and I was going to get another one anyway. To lose one's temper at  golf is foolish. It gets you nothing, not even relief. Imitate the  spirit of Marcus Aurelius. \"Whatever may befall thee,\" says that great  man in his \"Meditations\", \"it was preordained for thee from  everlasting. Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by  nature to bear.\" I like to think that this noble thought came to him  after he had sliced a couple of new balls into the woods, and that he  jotted it down on the back of his score-card. For there can be no doubt  that the man was a golfer, and a bad golfer at that. Nobody who had not  had a short putt stop on the edge of the hole could possibly have  written the words: \"That which makes the man no worse than he was makes  life no worse. It has no power to harm, without or within.\" Yes, Marcus  Aurelius undoubtedly played golf, and all the evidence seems to  indicate that he rarely went round in under a hundred and twenty. The  niblick was his club.    Speaking of Marcus Aurelius and the golfing temperament recalls to my  mind the case of young Mitchell Holmes. Mitchell, when I knew him  first, was a promising young man with a future before him in the  Paterson Dyeing and Refining Company, of which my old friend, Alexander  Paterson, was the president. He had many engaging qualities--among them  an unquestioned ability to imitate a bulldog quarrelling with a  Pekingese in a way which had to be heard to be believed. It was a gift  which made him much in demand at social gatherings in the  neighbourhood, marking him off from other young men who could only  almost play the mandolin or recite bits of Gunga Din; and no doubt it  was this talent of his which first sowed the seeds of love in the heart  of Millicent Boyd. Women are essentially hero-worshippers, and when a  warm-hearted girl like Millicent has heard a personable young man  imitating a bulldog and a Pekingese to the applause of a crowded  drawing-room, and has been able to detect the exact point at which the  Pekingese leaves off and the bulldog begins, she can never feel quite  the same to other men. In short, Mitchell and Millicent were engaged,  and were only waiting to be married till the former could bite the  Dyeing and Refining Company's ear for a bit of extra salary.    Mitchell Holmes had only one fault. He lost his temper when playing  golf. He seldom played a round without becoming piqued, peeved, or--in  many cases--chagrined. The caddies on our links, it was said, could  always worst other small boys in verbal argument by calling them some  of the things they had heard Mitchell call his ball on discovering it  in a cuppy lie. He had a great gift of language, and he used it  unsparingly. I will admit that there was some excuse for the man. He  had the makings of a brilliant golfer, but a combination of bad luck  and inconsistent play invariably robbed him of the fruits of his skill.  He was the sort of player who does the first two holes in one under  bogey and then takes an eleven at the third. The least thing upset him  on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the  butterflies in the adjoining meadows.    It seemed hardly likely that this one kink in an otherwise admirable  character would ever seriously affect his working or professional life,  but it did. One evening, as I was sitting in my garden, Alexander  Paterson was announced. A glance at his face told me that he had come  to ask my advice. Rightly or wrongly, he regarded me as one capable of  giving advice. It was I who had changed the whole current of his life  by counselling him to leave the wood in his bag and take a driving-iron  off the tee; and in one or two other matters, like the choice of a  putter (so much more important than the choice of a wife), I had been  of assistance to him.    Alexander sat down and fanned himself with his hat, for the evening was  warm. Perplexity was written upon his fine face.    \"I don't know what to do,\" he said.    \"Keep the head still--slow back--don't press,\" I said, gravely. There  is no better rule for a happy and successful life.    \"It's nothing to do with golf this time,\" he said. \"It's about the  treasurership of my company. Old Smithers retires next week, and I've  got to find a man to fill his place.\"    \"That should be easy. You have simply to select the most deserving from  among your other employees.\"    \"But which _is_ the most deserving? That's the point. There are  two men who are capable of holding the job quite adequately. But then I  realize how little I know of their real characters. It is the  treasurership, you understand, which has to be filled. Now, a man who  was quite good at another job might easily get wrong ideas into his  head when he became a treasurer. He would have the handling of large  sums of money. In other words, a man who in ordinary circumstances had  never been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#18)"],[1,"cords interlaced with each other, the emblem of rank and command,  and handed it to the driver. \"You will show this, Runoc, to any  you meet, for it may be that you will find parties of late comers  on the road. This will be a proof that you are journeying on my  business and under my orders. Do not stop and let them question  you, but drive quickly along, and if they should shout and bid  you stop, hold up the torque and shout, 'I travel at speed by my  chief's orders.'    \"Do you both sit down in the chariot,\" he said to the others. \"Then  as you journey rapidly along it will be supposed that you are either  wounded or messengers of importance. Farewell!\"    Cneius and the girl had already mounted the chariot, and the driver  now gave the horses rein and started at full speed. Beric turned and  re-entered the town slowly. In those days pity for the vanquished  was a sentiment but little comprehended, and he had certainly not  learned it among the Romans, who frequently massacred their prisoners  wholesale. Woe to the vanquished! was almost a maxim with them. But  Beric shrank from witnessing the scene, now that the tables were  turned upon the oppressors. Nationally he hated the Romans, but  individually he had no feeling against them, and had he had the  power he would at once have arrested the effusion of blood. He  wished to drive them from the kingdom, not to massacre them; but  he knew well that he had no power whatever in such a matter. Even  his own tribesmen would not have stayed their hand at his command.  To slay a Roman was to them a far more meritorious action than to  slay a wolf, and any one who urged mercy would have been regarded  not only as a weakling but as a traitor.    Already the work was well nigh done. Pouring in on all sides  into the city the Iceni had burst into the houses and slain their  occupants whether they resisted or not. A few men here and there  sold their lives dearly, but the great majority had been too panic  stricken with the sudden danger to attempt the slightest resistance.  Some of the inhabitants whose houses were near the temple had fled  thither for refuge before the assailants reached them, but in half  an hour from the striking of the first blow these and the troops  there were the sole survivors of the population of Camalodunum.  For the present the temple was disregarded. It was known that the  garrison did not exceed four hundred men, and there was no fear of  so small a body assuming the offensive.    The work of destruction had commenced. There was but little plundering,  for the Britons despised the Roman luxuries, of the greater part  of which they did not even comprehend the use. They were Roman,  and therefore to be hated as well as despised. Save, therefore,  weapons, which were highly prized, and gold ornaments, which were  taken as trinkets for the women at home, nothing was saved. As the  defenders of each house were slain, fire was applied to hangings  and curtains, and then the assailants hurried away in search of  fresh victims. Thus the work of destruction proceeded concurrently  with that of massacre, and as the sun rose vast columns of smoke  mounting upwards conveyed the news to the women of the Iceni and  Trinobantes for a circle of many miles round, that the attack had  been successful, and that Camalodunum, the seat of their oppressors,  was in flames. Beric, as he made his way towards the centre of the  town, sighed as he passed the shop where two months before he had  stopped a moment to look at the rolls of vellum.    The destruction of the monuments of Roman luxury; the houses with  their costly contents; and even the Palace of Cunobeline, which  had been converted into the residence of the Roman governor, had  not affected him; but he mourned over the loss of the precious  manuscripts which had contained such a wealth of stored up learning.  Already the house was wrapped in flames, which were rushing from  the windows, and the prize which he had looked upon as his own  special share of the plunder had escaped him.    At the edge of the broad open space that surrounded the Temple of  Claudius the Britons were gathering thickly. Beric applied his horn  to his lips, and in a few minutes the Sarci gathered round him.  Bidding them stand in order he moved away to see what disposition  was being made for the attack on the temple, but at present all  were too excited with their success for any to assume the lead or  give orders. At the first rush parties of the Britons had made for  the temple, but had been received with showers of darts and stones,  and had been met on the steps by the Roman soldiers and roughly  repulsed. Walking round he came upon the chariot of Boadicea. The  queen was flushed with excitement and gratified vengeance, and was  shaking her spear menacingly towards the temple; her eye presently  fell upon Beric.    \"The work has begun well, my young chief, but we have still to crush  the wolves in their den. It is a strong place, with its massive  walls unpierced save by the doorway at each end; but we will have  them out if to do so we are forced to tear it down stone by stone.\"    \"I trust that we shall not be as long as that would take, queen,\"  Beric said, \"for we have other work to do.\"    Just at this moment one of the chiefs of the Trinobantes came up.  \"Queen Boadicea,\" he said, \"we crave that we may be allowed to storm  the temple. It is built on our ground as a sign of our subjection,  and we would fain ourselves capture it.\"    \"Be it so,\" the queen replied. \"Do you undertake the task at once.\"    The Trinobantes, who had joined the Iceni in the attack on the  town, presently gathered with loud shouts, and under their chiefs  rushed at the temple. From the roof darts and stones were showered  down upon them; but though many were killed they swarmed up the  broad steps that surrounded it on all sides and attacked the doors.  Beric shook his head, and returning to his men led them off down  one of the broad streets to an open space a short distance away.    \"This will be our gathering place,\" he said. \"Do not wander far  away, and return quickly at the sound of my horn. We may be wanted  presently. I do not think that the Trinobantes will take the temple  in that fashion.\"    They had indeed advanced entirely unprovided with proper means  of assault. The massive gates against which the Romans had piled  stones, casks of provisions, and other heavy articles were not to  be broken down by such force as the Britons could bring against  them. In vain these chopped with their swords upon the woodwork.  The gates were constructed of oak, and the weapons scarce marked  them. In vain they threw themselves twenty abreast against them.  The doors hardly quivered at the shock, and in the meantime the  assailants were suffering heavily, for from openings in the roof,  extending from the building itself to the pillars that surrounded  it, the Romans dropped missiles upon them.    For some time the Trinobantes persevered, and then their chiefs,  seeing that the attempt was hopeless, called off their followers.  No fresh attempt was made for a time, and Boadicea established  herself in one of the few houses that had escaped the flames, and  there presently the chiefs assembled. Various suggestions were  made, but at last it was decided to batter in the doors with a  heavy tree, and a strong party of men were at once despatched to  fell and prepare two of suitable size. The operation was a long  one, as the trees when found had to be brought down by lighting  fires against the trunks, and it was nightfall before they fell and  the branches were cut off. It was decided, therefore, to postpone  the attack until the next day.    Beric had not been present at the council, to which only a few of  the leading chiefs had been summoned; but he doubted, when he heard  what had been decided upon, whether the attack would be successful.  It was settled that the Trinobantes were to attack the door at one  end of the temple, and the Iceni that at the other. Late in the  evening the chariot returned, and Beric was greatly relieved to hear  that the fugitives had been placed in safety and that the journey  had been made without interference. He was glad to recover his torque,  for its absence would have excited surprise when men's minds were  less occupied and excited. Not until he recovered it could he  go to see Parta, who was lodged with the queen, but as soon as he  recovered it he went in. Every sign of Roman habitation and luxury  had been, as far as possible, obliterated by order of Boadicea  before she entered the house. Hangings had been pulled down, statues  overthrown, and the paintings on the plaster chipped from the walls.    \"What have you been doing all day, Beric?\" his mother asked. \"I  looked to see you long before this, and should have thought that  some accident had befallen you had I not known that the news would  have been speedily brought me had it been so.\"    \"I have been looking after the tribesmen, mother. I should have  come in to see you, but did not wish to intrude among the chiefs  in council with the queen. You represented the Sarci here, and had  we been wanted you would have sent for me. Who are to attack the  temple tomorrow?\"    \"Not the Sarci, my son. Unser begged that he and his tribe might  have the honour, and the queen and council granted it to him.\"    \"I am glad of it, mother. The duty is an honourable one, but the  loss will be heavy, and others can do the work as well as we could,  and I want to keep our men for the shock of battle with the legions.  Moreover, I doubt whether the doors will be battered down in the  way they propose.\"    \"You do, Beric! and why is that?\" The speaker was Aska, who had  just left the group of chiefs gathered round the queen at the other  end of the apartment, and had come close without Beric hearing him.    The lad coloured. \"I spoke only for my mother's hearing,"]]]
