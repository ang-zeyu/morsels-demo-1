[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#19)"],[1,"rest--honest Hugh Woodgate,  the Venables girls, and their friends the young men in the various  works, who saw the old-fashioned courtesy with which Steel always  treated his wife, and the grace and charm of her consideration for  him--they were every one receiving a liberal object lesson in matrimony,  as some of them even realized at the time.    \"I wish I could learn to treat my wife as Steel does his,\" sighed the  good vicar, once when he had been inattentive at the table, and Morna  had rebuked him in fun. \"That would be my ideal--if I wasn't too old to  learn!\"    \"Then thank goodness you are,\" rejoined his wife. \"Let me catch you  dancing in front of me to open the doors, Hugh, and I shall keep my eye  on you as I've never kept it yet!\"    But Rachel herself did not dislike these little graces, partly because  they were not put on to impress an audience, but were an incident of  their private life as well; and partly because they stimulated a study  to which she had only given herself since their return to England and  their establishment at Normanthorpe House. This was her study of the man  who was still calmly studying her; she was returning the compliment at  last.    And of his character she formed by degrees some remote conception; he  was Steel by name and steel by nature, as the least observant might  discern, and the least witty remark; a grim inscrutability was his  dominant note; he was darkly alert, mysteriously vigilant, a measurer  of words, a governor of glances; and yet, with all his self-mastery and  mastery of others, there were human traits that showed themselves from  time to time as the months wore on. Rachel did not recognize among these  that studious consideration which she could still appreciate; it seemed  rather part of a preconceived method of treating his wife, and the wary  eye gleamed through it all. But it has been mentioned that Rachel at one  time had a voice, of which high hopes had been formed by inexperienced  judges. It was only at Normanthorpe that her second husband became aware  of her possession, one afternoon when she fancied that she had the house  to herself. So two could play at the game of consistent concealment! He  could not complain; it was in the bond, and he never said a word. But he  stood outside the window till she was done, for Rachel saw him in a  mirror, and for many an afternoon to come he would hover outside the  same window at the same time.    Why had he married her? Did he care for her, or did he not? What could  be the object of that extraordinary step? Rachel was as far from hitting  upon a feasible solution of these mysteries as she was from penetrating  the deeper one of his own past life. Sometimes she put the like  questions to herself; but they were more easily answered. She had been  in desperate straits, in reckless despair; even if her second marriage  had turned out no better than her first, she could not have been worse  off than she was on the night of her acquittal; but she had been very  well off ever since. Then there had been the incentive of adventure, the  fascination of that very mystery which was a mystery still. And  then--yes!--there had been the compelling will of a nature infinitely  stronger than her own or any other that she had ever known.    Did she regret this second marriage, this second leap in the dark? No,  she could not honestly pretend that she did; yet it had its sufficiently  sinister side, its occasional admixture of sheer horror. But this was  only when the mysteries which encompassed her happened to prey upon  nerves unstrung by some outwardly exciting cause; it was then she would  have given back all that he had ever given her to pierce the veil of her  husband's past. Here, however, the impulse was more subtle; it was not  the mere consuming curiosity which one in Rachel's position was bound to  feel; it was rather a longing to be convinced that that veil hid nothing  which should make her shudder to live under the same roof with this man.    Of one thing she was quite confident; wherever her husband had spent or  misspent his life (if any part of so successful a whole could really  have been misspent), it was not in England. He was un-English in a  hundred superficial ways--in none that cut deep. With all his essential  cynicism, there was the breadth and tolerance of a travelled man.  Cosmopolitan on the other hand, he could not be called; he had proved  himself too poor a linguist in every country that they had visited. It  was only now, in their home life, that Rachel received hints of the  truth, and it filled her with vague alarms, for that seemed to her to be  the last thing he need have kept to himself.    One day she saw him ride a fractious horse, not because he was fond of  riding, but because nobody in the stables could cope with this animal.  Steel tamed it in ten minutes. But a groom remarked upon the shortness  of his stirrups, in Rachel's hearing, and on the word a flash of memory  lit up her brain. All at once she remembered the incident of the  gum-leaves, soon after their arrival; he had told Morna what they were,  yet to his wife he had pretended not to know. If he also was an  Australian, why on earth should that fact, of all facts, be concealed  from her? Nor had it merely been concealed; it was a point upon which  Rachel had been deliberately misled, and the only one she could recall.    She was still brooding over it when a fresh incident occurred, which  served not only to confirm her suspicions in this regard, but to deepen  and intensify the vague horror with which her husband's presence  sometimes inspired her.    Mr. Steel was an exceptionally early riser. It was his boast that he  never went to sleep a second time; and one of his nearest approaches to  a confidence was the remark that he owed something to that habit. Now  Rachel, who was a bad sleeper, kept quite a different set of hours, and  was seldom seen outside her own rooms before the forenoon. One  magnificent morning, however, she was tempted to dress and make the best  of the day which she had watched breaking shade by shade. The lawns were  gray with dew; the birds were singing as they never sing twice in one  summer's day. Rachel thought that for once she would like to be up and  out before the sun was overpowering. And she proceeded to fulfil her  wish.    All had been familiar from the window; all was unfamiliar on the landing  and the stairs. No one had been down; the blinds were all drawn; a clock  ticked like a sledge-hammer in the hall. Rachel ran downstairs like a  mouse, and almost into the arms of her husband, whom she met coming out  of the dining-room with a loaded tray. Another would have dropped it;  with Steel there was not so much as a rattle of the things, but his  color changed, and Rachel had not yet had such a look as he gave her  with his pursed mouth and his flashing eyes.    \"What does this mean?\" he demanded, in the tone of distant thunder, with  little less than lightning in his glance.    \"I think that's for me to ask,\" laughed Rachel, standing up to him with  a nerve that surprised herself. \"I didn't know that you began so early!\"    A decanter and a glass were among the things upon the tray.    \"And I didn't know it of you,\" he retorted. \"Why are you up?\"    Rachel told him the simple truth in simple fashion. His tone of voice  did not hurt her; there was no opposite extreme of tenderness to call to  mind for the contrast which inflicts the wound. On the other hand, there  was a certain satisfaction in having for once ruffled that smooth mien  and smoother tongue; it was one of her rare glimpses of the real man,  but as usual it was a glimpse and nothing more.    \"I must apologize,\" said Steel, with an artificiality which was seldom  so transparent; \"my only excuse is that you startled me out of my temper  and my manners. And I was upset to begin with. I have a poor fellow in  rather a bad way in the boathouse.\"    \"Not one of the gardeners, I hope?\" queried Rachel; but her kind anxiety  subsided in a moment, for his dark eyes were measuring her, his dark  mind meditating a lie; and now she knew him well enough to read him thus  far in his turn.    \"No,\" replied Steel, deciding visibly against the lie; \"no, not one of  our men, or anybody else belonging to these parts; but some unlucky  tramp, whom I imagine some of our neighbors would have given into  custody forthwith. I found him asleep on the lawn; of course he had no  business upon the premises; but he's so far gone that I'm taking him  something to pull him together before I turn him off.\"    \"I should have said,\" remarked Rachel, thoughtfully, \"that tea or coffee  would have been better for him than spirits.\"    Steel smiled indulgently across the tray.    \"Most ladies would say the same,\" he replied, \"but very few men.\"    \"And why didn't you bring him into the house,\" pursued Rachel, looking  her husband very candidly in the face, \"instead of taking him all that  way to the lake, and giving yourself so much more trouble than was  necessary?\"    The smile broadened upon Steel's thin lips, perhaps because it had  entirely vanished from his glittering eyes.    \"That,\" said he, \"is a question you would scarcely ask if you had seen  the poor creature for yourself. I don't intend you to see him; he is a  rather saddening spectacle, and one of a type for which one can do  absolutely nothing permanent. And now, if you are quite satisfied, I  shall proceed, with your permission, to get rid of him in my own way.\"    It was seldom indeed that Steel descended to a display of sarcasm at his  wife's expense, though few people who came much in contact with him  escaped an occasional flick from a tongue that could be as bitter as it  was habitually smooth. His last words were therefore as remarkable as  his first; both were exceptions to a rule; and though Rachel moved away  without replying, feeling that there was indeed no more to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#19)"],[1,"you have not lost her. That makes all the difference.\"    \"I want to comfort you and I am powerless. I am unable to say  what--I--\"    He stopped short. As he stood gazing down into her sweet face,  burning, passionate words came to his lips; but he was dumb; he  could not speak. All day long he had been living in a dream. Now he  realized that but a moment remained for him to be near the girl he  loved so well. He was leaving her, perhaps never to see her again,  or to return to find her another's. A fierce pain tore his heart.    \"You--you are holding my hands,\" faltered Betty, in a doubtful,  troubled voice. She looked up into his face and saw that it was pale  with suppressed emotion.    Alfred was mad indeed. He forgot everything. In that moment the  world held nothing for him save that fair face. Her eyes, uplifted  to his in the moonlight, beamed with a soft radiance. They were  honest eyes, just now filled with innocent sadness and regret, but  they drew him with irresistible power. Without realizing in the  least what he was doing he yielded to the impulse. Bending his head  he kissed the tremulous lips.    \"Oh,\" whispered Betty, standing still as a statue and looking at him  with wonderful eyes. Then, as reason returned, a hot flush dyed her  face, and wrenching her hands free she struck him across the cheek.    \"For God's sake, Betty, I did not mean to do that! Wait. I have  something to tell you. For pity's sake, let me explain,\" he cried,  as the full enormity of his offence dawned upon him.    Betty was deaf to the imploring voice, for she ran into the house  and slammed the door.    He called to her, but received no answer. He knocked on the door,  but it remained closed. He stood still awhile, trying to collect his  thoughts, and to find a way to undo the mischief he had wrought.  When the real significance of his act came to him he groaned in  spirit. What a fool he had been! Only a few short hours and he must  start on a perilous journey, leaving the girl he loved in ignorance  of his real intentions. Who was to tell her that he loved her? Who  was to tell her that it was because his whole heart and soul had  gone to her that he had kissed her?    With bowed head he slowly walked away toward the fort, totally  oblivious of the fact that a young girl, with hands pressed tightly  over her breast to try to still a madly beating heart, watched him  from her window until he disappeared into the shadow of the  block-house.    Alfred paced up and down his room the four remaining hours of that  eventful day. When the light was breaking in at the east and dawn  near at hand he heard the rough voices of men and the tramping of  iron-shod hoofs. The hour of his departure was at hand.    He sat down at his table and by the aid of the dim light from a pine  knot he wrote a hurried letter to Betty. A little hope revived in  his heart as he thought that perhaps all might yet be well. Surely  some one would be up to whom he could intrust the letter, and if no  one he would run over and slip it under the door of Colonel Zane's  house.    In the gray of the early morning Alfred rode out with the daring  band of heavily armed men, all grim and stern, each silent with the  thought of the man who knows he may never return. Soon the  settlement was left far behind.        CHAPTER V.    During the last few days, in which the frost had cracked open the  hickory nuts, and in which the squirrels had been busily collecting  and storing away their supply of nuts for winter use, it had been  Isaac's wont to shoulder his rifle, walk up the hill, and spend the  morning in the grove.    On this crisp autumn morning he had started off as usual, and had  been called back by Col. Zane, who advised him not to wander far  from the settlement. This admonition, kind and brotherly though it  was, annoyed Isaac. Like all the Zanes he had born in him an intense  love for the solitude of the wilderness. There were times when  nothing could satisfy him but the calm of the deep woods.    One of these moods possessed him now. Courageous to a fault and  daring where daring was not always the wiser part, Isaac lacked the  practical sense of the Colonel and the cool judgment of Jonathan.  Impatient of restraint, independent in spirit, and it must be  admitted, in his persistence in doing as he liked instead of what he  ought to do, he resembled Betty more than he did his brothers.    Feeling secure in his ability to take care of himself, for he knew  he was an experienced hunter and woodsman, he resolved to take a  long tramp in the forest. This resolution was strengthened by the  fact that he did not believe what the Colonel and Jonathan had told  him--that it was not improbable some of the Wyandot braves were  lurking in the vicinity, bent on killing or recapturing him. At any  rate he did not fear it.    Once in the shade of the great trees the fever of discontent left  him, and, forgetting all except the happiness of being surrounded by  the silent oaks, he penetrated deeper and deeper into the forest.  The brushing of a branch against a tree, the thud of a falling nut,  the dart of a squirrel, and the sight of a bushy tail disappearing  round a limb--all these things which indicated that the little gray  fellows were working in the tree-tops, and which would usually have  brought Isaac to a standstill, now did not seem to interest him. At  times he stooped to examine the tender shoots growing at the foot of  a sassafras tree. Then, again, he closely examined marks he found in  the soft banks of the streams.    He went on and on. Two hours of this still-hunting found him on the  bank of a shallow gully through which a brook went rippling and  babbling over the mossy green stones. The forest was dense here;  rugged oaks and tall poplars grew high over the tops of the first  growth of white oaks and beeches; the wild grapevines which coiled  round the trees like gigantic serpents, spread out in the upper  branches and obscured the sun; witch-hopples and laurel bushes grew  thickly; monarchs of the forest, felled by some bygone storm, lay  rotting on the ground; and in places the wind-falls were so thick  and high as to be impenetrable.    Isaac hesitated. He realized that he had plunged far into the Black  Forest. Here it was gloomy; a dreamy quiet prevailed, that deep calm  of the wilderness, unbroken save for the distant note of the  hermit-thrush, the strange bird whose lonely cry, given at long  intervals, pierced the stillness. Although Isaac had never seen one  of these birds, he was familiar with that cry which was never heard  except in the deepest woods, far from the haunts of man.    A black squirrel ran down a tree and seeing the hunter scampered  away in alarm. Isaac knew the habits of the black squirrel, that it  was a denizen of the wildest woods and frequented only places remote  from civilization. The song of the hermit and the sight of the black  squirrel caused Isaac to stop and reflect, with the result that he  concluded he had gone much farther from the fort than he had  intended. He turned to retrace his steps when a faint sound from  down the ravine came to his sharp ears.    There was no instinct to warn him that a hideously painted face was  raised a moment over the clump of laurel bushes to his left, and  that a pair of keen eyes watched every move he made.    Unconscious of impending evil Isaac stopped and looked around him.  Suddenly above the musical babble of the brook and the rustle of the  leaves by the breeze came a repetition of the sound. He crouched  close by the trunk of a tree and strained his ears. All was quiet  for some moments. Then he heard the patter, patter of little hoofs  coming down the stream. Nearer and nearer they came. Sometimes they  were almost inaudible and again he heard them clearly and  distinctly. Then there came a splashing and the faint hollow sound  caused by hard hoofs striking the stones in shallow water. Finally  the sounds ceased.    Cautiously peering from behind the tree Isaac saw a doe standing on  the bank fifty yards down the brook. Trembling she had stopped as if  in doubt or uncertainty. Her ears pointed straight upward, and she  lifted one front foot from the ground like a thoroughbred pointer.  Isaac knew a doe always led the way through the woods and if there  were other deer they would come up unless warned by the doe.  Presently the willows parted and a magnificent buck with wide  spreading antlers stepped out and stood motionless on the bank.  Although they were down the wind Isaac knew the deer suspected some  hidden danger. They looked steadily at the clump of laurels at  Isaac's left, a circumstance he remarked at the time, but did not  understand the real significance of until long afterward.    Following the ringing report of Isaac's rifle the buck sprang almost  across the stream, leaped convulsively up the bank, reached the top,  and then his strength failing, slid down into the stream, where, in  his dying struggles, his hoofs beat the water into white foam. The  doe had disappeared like a brown flash.    Isaac, congratulating himself on such a fortunate shot--for rarely  indeed does a deer fall dead in his tracks even when shot through  the heart--rose from his crouching position and commenced to reload  his rifle. With great care he poured the powder into the palm of his  hand, measuring the quantity with his eye--for it was an evidence of  a hunter's skill to be able to get the proper quantity for the ball.  Then he put the charge into the barrel. Placing a little greased  linsey rag, about half an inch square, over the muzzle, he laid a  small lead bullet on it, and with the ramrod began to push the ball  into the barrel.    A slight rustle behind him, which sounded to him like the gliding of  a rattlesnake over the leaves, caused him to start and turn round.  But he was too late.
