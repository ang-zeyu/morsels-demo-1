Between hours of 12 and 2 A.M. having caught  Henry Willis and John  Missing asleep in their watch, put both in irons.. 8 A.M. vessel  drove...she tailed in on a  mudbank, which obliged us to weight the best bower and with the long boat  lay it ahead to heave her off. At noon hove into 1/2 2 fathoms.    \"Monday, 28th December. Wind at south-west at 3 P.M...up anchor and ran  to leeward of Lady Nelson's Point.    \"Tuesday, 29th December. Winds at south-west. Shifted to north-west and  freshened into a gale with cloudy weather: thus has this kind of weather  bound us here this last 12 days...Sent the first mate and a party to see  and shoot some birds.    \"Wednesday, 30th December. First part the wind veered to south-west and  blew so hard that we were obliged to give her the long service of the  cable although we lay under the land and not half a mile from it. No  fires have been seen these last three or four days.    \"Thursday, 21st December. First and middle parts fine weather--at 3 P.M.  seeing a number of swans near Churchill's Island, sent the First Mate in  the boat to see and get some of them; he was lucky enough to catch  six...Up anchor and run down into Elizabeth's Cove. At half-past 6 P.M.  came to an anchor in 7 fathoms. By half-past 7 P.M. got on board two or  300 gallons of water and some wood. The well was in fine order,  overflowed and water clear. We here discovered another spring the banks  of which were covered with water-cresses and wild blackberries, got some  of both on board. I had intended going inland on the island some way,  this was baffled by a strong wind coming from west-north-west which threw  the sea into the cove--not at all pleasant. I therefore up anchor and  again ran up under Lady Nelson's Point.    \"Friday, 1st January 1802. All this 24 hours it has been blowing a hard  gale...The New Year was ushered in with us splicing the main brace and  three cheers; by the weather with a black squall of wind and rain.  Released Robert Warren.    \"Saturday, 2nd January. Strong gales with hard squalls, later cloudy. New  slung our two Nun buoys; sent officer and some hands to cut wood.  Observed fire a long way off in north-east Branch.    \"Sunday, January 3rd. P.M. Sent the 1st Mate with 4 hands in launch to  the River to try for some birds.    \"Monday, 4th January. Variable weather. At 2 P.M. the launch returned. We  have got at last some knowledge of the natives of this part of the  country. The following is the substance of the report of Mr. Bowen, 1st  Mate:--    \"At 7 A.M. left the head of Fresh Water River having in vain looked for  some of the crowned birds, and having been able to shoot nothing (a few  ducks excepted), having proceeded down the river, and being nearly  half-way on board he observed a fire lighted on the beach between  Crownhead and the entrance of the River and thinking it could be nothing  but natives he immediately put back to prove this. As the boat approached  the beach these blacks were perceived sitting in the same form as those  of Sydney, and each of them had a bundle of spears in their hands. Our  people hallowed them which they instantly answered and did not seem at  all alarmed on the nearer approach of the boat, three boys made their  appearance. As between the beach and the boat there lay a bank of mud  about 200 yards across, Mr. Bowen could not get quite so close as he  could wish, however, he singly got out and began to walk towards them,  which when they perceived, they jumped upon their feet and it was now  perceived that one of them was a very old man with a large bushy beard  and the rest of his face besmeared with red ochre. The others were young  men. They were all clothed with the skins of oppossums as far as their  middle, and this old man seemed to have command over the others. As Mr.  Bowen advanced they all pulled off their dress and made signs to the  officer that before he came any nearer he must do the same; this was  immediately complied with.    \"They then all sat down again and Mr. Bowen, plucking a root of fern,  advanced pretty close to them holding it up; they seemed to understand it  as it was meant. When he got within a few yards of this party the old man  seemed rather uneasy and began to handle his spears. Mr. Bowen then threw  them a tomahawk, and one of the young men picked it up; on Mr. Bowen  beckoning them to sit down, he doing the same, they again threw him back  the tomahawk, and all except the old man sat down. Mr. Bowen then broke a  piece of stick and cut it with the tomahawk and tyed a handkerchief to it  and again reached it to them; on this, one of the young men ventured to  reach his hand and take it out of the officer's but would by no means be  so familiar as to shake hands. Mr. Bowen then ate some bread and then  gave them some which they did not eat, but carefully laid it by under  some fern roots or leaves; on getting some ducks they took no other  notice of them than to examine in what manner they were killed, what  their ideas on that head were we know not as they did not take the least  notice of our firearms even when, towards the latter end of the parley,  it was found necessary to point one at the breast of the old man who all  along was very suspicious of our designs.    \"All this time they expressed a good deal of wonder at the colour of Mr.  Bowen's skin, and one of the young men made very significant signs to him  that he must have washed himself very hard. They now made signs for Mr.  Bowen to go back to the boat and pointed down along the beach to Crown  Head. Mr. Bowen accordingly went into the boat and pulled down as they  walked, after pulling about 1 1/2 miles they stopped and beckoned for the  boat to come in--here 3 women made their appearance each with a child at  her back. Mr. Bowen went on shore here, little passed on either side  further than on Mr. Bowen asking for fire to warm himself. They pointed  to the boat and made signs for him to go there and get it the women  sometimes shook their hands to him, and the boys laughing and hooping. A  few more trifles were here given to them. A little before this all our  people got out of the boat stark naked as was desired and walked somewhat  near the natives, on which the old man sent the boys away to the women,  and he, after having been in a great passion, made signs for us to go to  the boat, began to retire with his face to us and brandishing his spear  as that everyone thought he would heave it, when our people turned their  backs the young men seemed more quiet. As we saw that all hope of further  intercourse for the present was at an end Mr. Bowen ordered Bond to fire  his piece over their heads in order to make good his retreat to the boat.  This had the desired effect, as they one and all were out of sight in an  instant. Before this they must have taken the musket for nothing but a  stick. All the weapons they possessed were their spears (of a small size)  and a stone tomahawk along with the wumera they throw with. With respect  to their size the young men were much the same as those of Sydney or  Jarvis Bay. They were not deficient in making out our signs, and we were  easy able to understand from their motions what they would be at. From  there being but little food for them on the beaches here, and their being  clothed in the skins of the oppossums, I presume they are Bush natives,  the women, I forgot to mention, appeared to be middling well shaped, and  good-looking children, they were, however, always at some distance.    \"Mr. Bowen and the people having joined the boat came on board. Observed  all the remainder of the day they retired back into the woods and about 6  P.M. dous'd their fire at once although it must have covered an acre of  ground. At 4 A.M. a light wind sprung up at east, got our kedge hove  short, loosed sails and hove up--made sail for Elizabeth's Cove...\"    \"Tuesday, 5th January. Winds from south-east to east with cloudy weather.  At quarter past 1 P.M. Cape Shank bore north-east by north 9 miles. Kept  running down along the land steering west and west by north in order to  traverse the whole of this land, found it impossible to survey any part  of the coast as yet from the numerous native fires which covered this low  shore in one volume of smoke. At 3 P.M.* (* i.e. 3 P.M. on January 4th by  the civil reckoning. See above note.) we saw ahead land bearing  west-north-west distant 12 miles, and an opening in the land that had the  appearance of a harbour north-west 10 or 12 miles, bore away for this  last it having the appearance of fine steady weather...Accordingly kept  standing down for this entrance which every minute from its appearance  made us sure it was a good harbour.* (* The entrance to Port Phillip;  Murray returned here January 30th.) At 5 P.M. saw a small island in the  entrance and observed that between it and the main lay a reef...the 1st  Mate and the the Boatswain's Mate at the masthead looking out. At this  time I suppose we were within 1 1/2 miles of the entrance...and I  perceived that the sea broke short and was withal heavy--hove the lead  and found only 10 fathoms water...Astonished at this, I hauled our wind  and called out to them at the masthead to know if they saw any danger,  but none was seen. I bore away and deepened into 11 fathoms when Mr.  Bowen called out \"Rocks ahead,\" immediately hauled our wind and stood  off...going often to the masthead I saw that the reef did nearly stretch  across the whole way, but inside saw a sheet of smooth water of great  extent. From the wind blowing dead on this shore, I was obliged to haul  off to clear the land, but with a determination to overhaul it as no  doubt it has a channel into it and is apparently a fine harbour of large  extent.

So also at iii. 399, &c.      \"Lucus erat longo nunquam violatus ab aevo.    ... Barbara ritu    Sacra Deum, structae diris altaribus arae,    Omnis et humanis lustrata cruoribus arbor.\"    [64] That is, as in the preceding case, a deity whose attributes  corresponded to those of the Roman Mars. This appears to have been  not _Thor_, who is rather the representative of the Roman Jupiter, but  _Tyr_, \"a warrior god, and the protector of champions and brave men!\"  \"From _Tyr_ is derived the name given to the third day of the week in  most of the Teutonic languages, and which has been rendered into Latin  by _Dies Martis_. Old Norse, _Tirsdagr_, _Tisdagr_; Swedish, _Tisdag_;  Danish, _Tirsdag_; German, _Dienstag_; Dutch, _Dingsdag_; Anglo-Saxon,  _Tyrsdaeg_, _Tyvesdag_, _Tivesdaeg_; English, _Tuesday_\"--(Mallet's  North. Ant. ch. v.)--_White_.    [65] The Suevi appear to have been the Germanic tribes, and this also  the worship spoken of at chap. xl. _Signum in modum liburnae figuration  _corresponds with the _vehiculum_ there spoken of; the real thing being,  according to Ritter's view, a pinnace placed on wheels. That _signum  ipsum _(\"the very symbol\") does not mean any image of the goddess, may  be gathered also from ch. xl., where the goddess herself, _si credere  velis_, is spoken of as being washed in the sacred lake.    [66] As the Romans in their ancient coins, many of which are now extant,  recorded the arrival of Saturn by the stern of a ship; so other nations  have frequently denoted the importation of a foreign religious rite by  the figure of a galley on their medals.    [67] Tacitus elsewhere speaks of temples of German divinities (e.g. 40;  Templum Nerthae, Ann. i. 51; Templum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove,  or any other sacred place, was called templum by the Romans.    [68] The Scythians are mentioned by Herodotus, and the Alans by Ammianus  Marcellinus, as making use of these divining rods. The German method of  divination with them is illustrated by what is said by Saxo-Grammaticus  (Hist. Dan. xiv, 288) of the inhabitants of the Isle of Rugen in the  Baltic Sea: \"Throwing, by way of lots, three pieces of wood, white in  one part, and black in another, into their laps, they foretold good  fortune by the coming up of the white; bad by that of the black.\"    [69] The same practice obtained among the Persians, from whom the  Germans appear to be sprung. Darius was elected king by the neighing  of a horse; sacred white horses were in the army of Cyrus; and Xerxes,  retreating after his defeat, was preceded by the sacred horses  and consecrated chariot. Justin (i. 10) mentions the cause of this  superstition, viz. that \"the Persians believed the Sun to be the only  God, and horses to be peculiarly consecrated to him.\" The priest of the  Isle of Rugen also took auspices from a white horse, as may be seen in  Saxo-Grammaticus.    [70] Montesquieu finds in this custom the origin of the duel, and of  knight-errantry.    [71] This remarkable passage, so curious in political history, is  commented on by Montesquieu, in his Spirit of Laws. vi 11. That  celebrated author expresses his surprise at the existence of such a  balance between liberty and authority in the forests of Germany; and  traces the origin of the English constitution from this source. Tacitus  again mentions the German form of government in his Annals, iv. 33.    [72] The high antiquity of this made of reckoning appears from the Book  of Genesis. \"The evening and the morning were the first day.\" The Gauls,  we are informed by Caesar, \"assert that, according to the tradition of  their Druids, they are all sprung from Father Dis; on which account they  reckon every period of time according to the number of nights, not of  days; and observe birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in  such a manner, that the day seems to follow the night.\" (Bell. Gall.  vi. 18.) The vestiges of this method of computation still appear in the  English language, in the terms se'nnight and fort'night.    [73] _Ut turbae placuit_. Doederlein interprets this passage as  representing the confused way in which the people took their seats in  the national assembly, without reference to order, rank, age, &c.  It rather represents, however, that the people, not the chieftains,  determined when the business of the council should begin.--_White_.    [74] And in an open plain. Vast heaps of stone still remaining, denote  the scenes of these national councils. (See Mallet's Introduct. to Hist.  of Denmark.) The English Stonehenge has been supposed a relic of this  kind. In these assemblies are seen the origin of those which, under the  Merovingian race of French kings, were called the Fields of March;  under the Carlovingian, the Fields of May; then, the Plenary Courts of  Christmas and Easter; and lastly, the States General.    [75] The speech of Civilis was received with this expression of  applause. Tacitus, Hist. iv. 15.    [76] Gibbeted alive. Heavy penalties were denounced against those who  should take them down, alive or dead. These are particularized in the  Salic law.    [77] By cowards and dastards, in this passage, are probably meant those  who, being summoned to war, refused or neglected to go. Caesar (Bell.  Gall. vi. 22) mentions, that those who refused to follow their chiefs  to war were considered as deserters and traitors. And, afterwards, the  emperor Clothaire made the following edict, preserved in the Lombard  law: \"Whatever freeman, summoned to the defence of his country by his  Count, or his officers, shall neglect to go, and the enemy enter the  country to lay it waste, or otherwise damage our liege subjects,  he shall incur a capital punishment.\" As the crimes of cowardice,  treachery, and desertion were so odious and ignominious among the  Germans, we find by the Salic law, that penalties were annexed to the  unjust imputation of them.    [78] These were so rare and so infamous among the Germans, that barely  calling a person by a name significant of them was severely punished.    [79] Incestuous people were buried alive in bogs in Scotland. Pennant's  Tour in Scotland, 1772; part i. p. 351; and part ii. p. 421.    [80] Among these slighter offences, however, were reckoned homicide,  adultery, theft, and many others of a similar kind. This appears from  the laws of the Germans, and from a subsequent passage of Tacitus  himself.    [81] These were at that time the only riches of the country, as was  already observed in this treatise. Afterwards gold and silver became  plentiful: hence all the mulcts required by the Salic law are pecuniary.  Money, however, still bore a fixed proportion to cattle; as appears from  the Saxon law (Tit. xviii.): \"The Solidus is of two kinds; one contains  two tremisses, that is, a beeve of twelve months, or a sheep with its  lamb; the other, three tremisses, or a beeve of sixteen months. Homicide  is compounded for by the lesser solidus; other crimes by the greater.\"  The Saxons had their Weregeld,--the Scotch their Cro, Galnes, and  Kelchin,--and the Welsh their Gwerth, and Galanus, or compensations for  injuries; and cattle were likewise the usual fine. Vide Pennant's Tour  in Wales of 1773, pp. 273, 274.    [82] This mulct is frequently in the Salic law called \"fred,\" that is,  peace; because it was paid to the king or state, as guardians of the  public peace.    [83] A brief account of the civil economy of the Germans will here be  useful. They were divided into nations; of which some were under a  regal government, others a republican. The former had kings, the latter  chiefs. Both in kingdoms and republics, military affairs were under the  conduct of the generals. The nations were divided into cantons; each of  which was superintended by a chief, or count, who administered justice  in it. The cantons were divided into districts or hundreds, so called  because they contained a hundred vills or townships. In each hundred  was a companion, or centenary, chosen from the people, before whom small  causes were tried. Before the count, all causes, as well great as small,  were amenable. The centenaries are called companions by Tacitus, after  the custom of the Romans; among whom the titles of honor were, Caesar,  the Legatus or Lieutenant of Caesar, and his comites, or companions. The  courts of justice were held in the open air, on a rising ground, beneath  the shade of an oak, elm, or some other large tree.    [84] Even judges were armed on the seat of justice. The Romans, on  the contrary, never went armed but when actually engaged in military  service.    [85] These are the rudiments of the famous institution of chivalry. The  sons of kings appear to have received arms from foreign princes. Hence,  when Audoin, after overcoming the Gepidae, was requested by the Lombards  to dine with his son Alboin, his partner in the victory, he refused;  for, says he, \"you know it is not customary with us for a king's son  to dine with his father, until he has received arms from the king of  another country.\"--Warnefrid, De gestis Langobardorum, i. 23.    [86] An allusion to the _toga virilis_ of the Romans. The German youth  were presented with the shield and spear probably at twelve or fifteen  years of age. This early initiation into the business of arms gave them  that warlike character for which they were so celebrated. Thus, Seneca  (Epist. 46) says, \"A native of Germany brandishes, while yet a boy,  his slender javelin.\" And again (in his book on Anger, i. 11), \"Who are  braver than the Germans?--who more impetuous in the charge?--who fonder  of arms, in the use of which they are born and nourished, which are  their only care?--who more inured to hardships, insomuch that for "]]]
