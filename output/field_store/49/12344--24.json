Tell him to step right out here and get ready to talk. We don't  mean him no harm less'n he can't explain one or two things. Hop along!\"    The \"boy\" did not stir. Only he shifted his eyes from face to face and  his grin broadened. Ripples of mirth waved along his chest and convulsed  his face, but still he did not laugh. \"Go in and tell them things to  Donnegan,\" he said. \"But don't ask me to wake him up. He's sleepin'  soun' an' fas'. Like a baby; mostly, he sleeps every day to get rested  up for the night. Now, can't you-all wait till Donnegan wakes up  tonight? No? Then step right in, gen'lemen; but if you-all is set on  wakin' him up now, George will jus' step over the hill, because he don't  want to be near the explosion.\"    At this, he allowed his mirth free rein. His laughter shook up to his  throat, to his enormous mouth; it rolled and bellowed across the  hillside; and the posse stood, each man in his place, and looked  frigidly upon one another. But having been laughed at, they felt it  necessary to go on, and do or die. So they strode across the hill and  were almost to the door when another phenomenon occurred. A girl in a  cheap calico dress of blue was seen to run out of a neighboring shack  and spring up before the door of Donnegan's hut. When she faced the  crowd it stopped again.    The soft wind was blowing the blue dress into lovely, long, curving  lines; about her throat a white collar of some sheer stuff was being  lifted into waves, or curling against her cheek; and the golden hair, in  disorder, was tousled low upon her forehead.    Whirling thus upon the crowd, she shocked them to a pause, with her  parted lips, her flare of delicate color.    \"Have you come here,\" she cried, \"for--for Donnegan?\"    \"Lady,\" began someone, and then looked about for Jack Landis, who was  considered quite a hand with the ladies. But Jack Landis was discovered  fading out of view down the hillside. One glance at that blue dress had  quite routed him, for now he remembered the red-haired man who had  escorted Lou Macon to The Corner--and the colonel's singular trust in  this fellow. It explained much, and he fled before he should be noticed.    Before the spokesman could continue his speech, the girl had whipped  inside the door. And the posse was dumbfounded. Milligan saw that the  advance was ruined. \"Boys,\" he said, \"we came to fight a man; not to  storm a house with a woman in it. Let's go back. We'll tend to Donnegan  later on.\"    \"We'll drill him clean!\" muttered the others furiously, and straightway  the posse departed down the hill.    But inside the girl had found, to her astonishment, that Donnegan was  stretched upon his bunk wrapped again in the silken dressing gown and  with a smile upon his lips. He looked much younger, as he slept, and  perhaps it was this that made the girl steal forward upon tiptoe and  touch his shoulder so gently.    He was up on his feet in an instant. Alas, vanity, vanity! Donnegan in  shoes was one thing, for his shoes were of a particular kind; but  Donnegan in his slippers was a full two inches shorter. He was hardly  taller than the girl; he was, if the bitter truth must be known, almost  a small man. And Donnegan was furious at having been found by her in  such careless attire--and without those dignity-building shoes. First  he wanted to cut the throat of big George.    \"What have you done, what have you done?\" cried the girl, in one of  those heart-piercing whispers of fear. \"They have come for you--a whole  crowd--of armed men--they're outside the door! What have you done? It  was something done for me, I know!\"    Donnegan suddenly transferred his wrath from big George to the mob.    \"Outside my door?\" he asked. And as he spoke he slipped on a belt at  which a heavy holster tugged down on one side, and buckled it around  him.    \"Oh, no, no, no!\" she pleaded, and caught him in her arms.    Donnegan allowed her to stop him with that soft power for a moment,  until his face went white--as if with pain. Then he adroitly gathered  both her wrists into one of his bony hands; and having rendered her  powerless, he slipped by her and cast open the door.    It was an empty scene upon which they looked, with big George rocking  back and forth upon a rock, convulsed with silent laughter. Donnegan  looked sternly at the girl and swallowed. He was fearfully susceptible  to mockery.    \"There seems to have been a jest?\" he said.    But she lifted him a happy, tearful face.    \"Ah, thank heaven!\" she cried gently.    Oddly enough, Donnegan at this set his teeth and turned upon his heel,  and the girl stole out the door again, and closed it softly behind her.  As a matter of fact, not even the terrible colonel inspired in her quite  the fear which Donnegan instilled.          19      \"Big Landis lost his nerve and sidestepped at the last minute, and then  the whole gang faded.\"    That was the way the rumors of the affair always ended at each  repetition in Lebrun's and Milligan's that night. The Corner had had  many things to talk about during its brief existence, but nothing to  compare with a man who entered a shooting scrape with such a fellow as  Scar-faced Lewis all for the sake of a spray of mint. And the main topic  of conversation was: Did Donnegan aim at the body or the hand of the  bouncer?    On the whole, it was an excellent thing for Milligan's. The place was  fairly well crowded, with a few vacant tables. For everyone wanted to  hear Milligan's version of the affair. He had a short and vigorous one,  trimmed with neat oaths. It was all the girl in the blue calico dress,  according to him. The posse couldn't storm a house with a woman in it or  even conduct a proper lynching in her presence. And no one was able to  smile when Milligan said this. Neither was anyone nervy enough to  question the courage of Landis. It looked strange, that sudden flight of  his, but then, he was a proven man. Everyone remembered the affair of  Lester. It had been a clean-cut fight, and Jack Landis had won cleanly  on his merits.    Nevertheless some of the whispers had not failed to come to the big man,  and his brow was black.    The most terribly heartless and selfish passion of all is shame in a  young man. To repay the sidelong glances which he met on every side,  Jack Landis would have willingly crowded every living soul in The Corner  into one house and touched a match to it. And chiefly because he felt  the injustice of the suspicion. He had no fear of Donnegan.    He had a theory that little men had little souls. Not that he ever  formulated the theory in words, but he vaguely felt it and adhered to  it. He had more fear of one man of six two than a dozen under five ten.  He reserved in his heart of hearts a place of awe for one man whom he  had never seen. That was for Lord Nick, for that celebrated character  was said to be as tall and as finely built as Jack Landis himself. But  as for Donnegan--Landis wished there were three Donnegans instead of  one.    Tonight his cue was surly silence. For Nelly Lebrun had been warned by  her father, and she was making desperate efforts to recover any ground  she might have lost. Besides, to lose Jack Landis would be to lose the  most spectacular fellow in The Corner, to say nothing of the one who  held the largest and the choicest of the mines. The blond, good looks of  Landis made a perfect background for her dark beauty. With all these  stakes to play for, Nelly outdid herself. If she were attractive enough  ordinarily, when she exerted herself to fascinate, Nelly was  intoxicating. What chance had poor Jack Landis against her? He did not  call for her that night but went to play gloomily at Lebrun's until  Nelly walked into Lebrun's and drew him away from a table. Half an hour  later she had him whirling through a dance in Milligan's and had danced  the gloom out of his mind for the moment. Before the evening was well  under way, Landis was making love to her openly, and Nelly was in the  position of one who had roused the bear.    It was a dangerous flirtation and it was growing clumsy. In any place  other than The Corner it would have been embarrassing long ago; and when  Jack Landis, after a dance, put his one big hand over both of Nelly's  and held her moveless while he poured out a passionate declaration,  Nelly realized that something must be done. Just what she could not  tell.    And it was at this very moment that a wave of silence, beginning at the  door, rushed across Milligan's dance floor. It stopped the bartenders in  the act of mixing drinks; it put the musicians out of key, and in the  midst of a waltz phrase they broke down and came to a discordant pause.    What was it?    The men faced the door, wondering, and then the swift rumor passed from  lip to lip--almost from eye to eye, so rapidly it sped--Donnegan is  coming! Donnegan, and big George with him.    \"Someone tell Milligan!\"    But Milligan had already heard; he was back of the bar giving  directions; guns were actually unlimbering. What would happen?    \"Shall I get you out of this?\" Landis asked the girl.    \"Leave now?\" She laughed fiercely and silently. \"I'm just beginning to  live! Miss Donnegan in action? No, sir!\"    She would have given a good deal to retract that sentence, for it washed  the face of Landis white with jealousy.    Surely Donnegan had built greater than he knew.    And suddenly he was there in the midst of the house. No one had stopped  him--at least, no one had interfered with his servant. Big George had on  a white suit and a dappled green necktie; he stood directly behind his  master and made him look like a small boy. For Donnegan was in black,  and he had a white neckcloth wrapped as high and stiffly as an  old-fashioned stock. Altogether he was a queer, drab figure compared  with the brilliant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#19)"],[1," throng.  Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight  The triumph, which plays ever round the point,  That overcame me, seeming (for it did)  Engirt by that it girdeth.  Wherefore love,  With loss of other object, forc'd me bend  Mine eyes on Beatrice once again.    If all, that hitherto is told of her,  Were in one praise concluded, 't were too weak  To furnish out this turn.  Mine eyes did look  On beauty, such, as I believe in sooth,  Not merely to exceed our human, but,  That save its Maker, none can to the full  Enjoy it.  At this point o'erpower'd I fail,  Unequal to my theme, as never bard  Of buskin or of sock hath fail'd before.  For, as the sun doth to the feeblest sight,  E'en so remembrance of that witching smile  Hath dispossess my spirit of itself.  Not from that day, when on this earth I first  Beheld her charms, up to that view of them,  Have I with song applausive ever ceas'd  To follow, but not follow them no more;  My course here bounded, as each artist's is,  When it doth touch the limit of his skill.    She (such as I bequeath her to the bruit  Of louder trump than mine, which hasteneth on,  Urging its arduous matter to the close),  Her words resum'd, in gesture and in voice  Resembling one accustom'd to command:  \"Forth from the last corporeal are we come  Into the heav'n, that is unbodied light,  Light intellectual replete with love,  Love of true happiness replete with joy,  Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight.  Here shalt thou look on either mighty host  Of Paradise; and one in that array,  Which in the final judgment thou shalt see.\"    As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen  Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes  The visive spirits dazzled and bedimm'd;  So, round about me, fulminating streams  Of living radiance play'd, and left me swath'd  And veil'd in dense impenetrable blaze.  Such weal is in the love, that stills this heav'n;  For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!    No sooner to my list'ning ear had come  The brief assurance, than I understood  New virtue into me infus'd, and sight  Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain  Excess of light, however pure.  I look'd;  And in the likeness of a river saw  Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves  Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on  'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,  Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,  There ever and anon, outstarting, flew  Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow'rs  Did set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;  Then, as if drunk with odors, plung'd again  Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one  Re'enter'd, still another rose.  \"The thirst  Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam'd,  To search the meaning of what here thou seest,  The more it warms thee, pleases me the more.  But first behooves thee of this water drink,  Or ere that longing be allay'd.\"  So spake  The day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin'd:  \"This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,  And diving back, a living topaz each,  With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,  Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth  They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things  Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,  For that thy views not yet aspire so high.\"  Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,  Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,  As I toward the water, bending me,  To make the better mirrors of mine eyes  In the refining wave; and, as the eaves  Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith  Seem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round,  Then as a troop of maskers, when they put  Their vizors off, look other than before,  The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;  So into greater jubilee were chang'd  Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw  Before me either court of heav'n displac'd.    O prime enlightener! thou who crav'st me strength  On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!  Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd,      There is in heav'n a light, whose goodly shine  Makes the Creator visible to all  Created, that in seeing him alone  Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,  That the circumference were too loose a zone  To girdle in the sun.  All is one beam,  Reflected from the summit of the first,  That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,  And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes  Its image mirror'd in the crystal flood,  As if 't admire its brave appareling  Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,  Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,  Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth  Has to the skies return'd.  How wide the leaves  Extended to their utmost of this rose,  Whose lowest step embosoms such a space  Of ample radiance!  Yet, nor amplitude  Nor height impeded, but my view with ease  Took in the full dimensions of that joy.  Near or remote, what there avails, where God  Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends  Her sway?  Into the yellow of the rose  Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,  Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent  Of praises to the never-wint'ring sun,  As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,  Beatrice led me; and, \"Behold,\" she said,  \"This fair assemblage! stoles of snowy white  How numberless!  The city, where we dwell,  Behold how vast! and these our seats so throng'd  Few now are wanting here!  In that proud stall,  On which, the crown, already o'er its state  Suspended, holds thine eyes--or ere thyself  Mayst at the wedding sup,--shall rest the soul  Of the great Harry, he who, by the world  Augustas hail'd, to Italy must come,  Before her day be ripe.  But ye are sick,  And in your tetchy wantonness as blind,  As is the bantling, that of hunger dies,  And drives away the nurse.  Nor may it be,  That he, who in the sacred forum sways,  Openly or in secret, shall with him  Accordant walk: Whom God will not endure  I' th' holy office long; but thrust him down  To Simon Magus, where Magna's priest  Will sink beneath him: such will be his meed.\"          CANTO XXXI    In fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay then  Before my view the saintly multitude,  Which in his own blood Christ espous'd.  Meanwhile  That other host, that soar aloft to gaze  And celebrate his glory, whom they love,  Hover'd around; and, like a troop of bees,  Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,  Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,  Flew downward to the mighty flow'r, or rose  From the redundant petals, streaming back  Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.  Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;  The rest was whiter than the driven snow.  And as they flitted down into the flower,  From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,  Whisper'd the peace and ardour, which they won  From that soft winnowing.  Shadow none, the vast  Interposition of such numerous flight  Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view  Obstructed aught.  For, through the universe,  Wherever merited, celestial light  Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents.    All there, who reign in safety and in bliss,  Ages long past or new, on one sole mark  Their love and vision fix'd.  O trinal beam  Of individual star, that charmst them thus,  Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below!    If the grim brood, from Arctic shores that roam'd,  (Where helice, forever, as she wheels,  Sparkles a mother's fondness on her son)  Stood in mute wonder 'mid the works of Rome,  When to their view the Lateran arose  In greatness more than earthly; I, who then  From human to divine had past, from time  Unto eternity, and out of Florence  To justice and to truth, how might I choose  But marvel too?  'Twixt gladness and amaze,  In sooth no will had I to utter aught,  Or hear.  And, as a pilgrim, when he rests  Within the temple of his vow, looks round  In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell  Of all its goodly state: e'en so mine eyes  Cours'd up and down along the living light,  Now low, and now aloft, and now around,  Visiting every step.  Looks I beheld,  Where charity in soft persuasion sat,  Smiles from within and radiance from above,  And in each gesture grace and honour high.    So rov'd my ken, and its general form  All Paradise survey'd: when round I turn'd  With purpose of my lady to inquire  Once more of things, that held my thought suspense,  But answer found from other than I ween'd;  For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,  I saw instead a senior, at my side,   Rob'd, as the rest, in glory.  Joy benign  Glow'd in his eye, and o'er his cheek diffus'd,  With gestures such as spake a father's love.  And, \"Whither is she vanish'd?\"  straight I ask'd.    \"By Beatrice summon'd,\" he replied,  \"I come to aid thy wish.  Looking aloft  To the third circle from the highest, there  Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit  Hath plac'd her.\"  Answering not, mine eyes I rais'd,  And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow  A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.  Not from the centre of the sea so far  Unto the region of the highest thunder,  As was my ken from hers; and yet the form  Came through that medium down, unmix'd and pure,    \"O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!  Who, for my safety, hast not scorn'd, in hell  To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark'd!  For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power  And goodness, virtue owe and grace.  Of slave,  Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,  For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.  Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.  That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,  Is loosen'd from this body, it may find  Favour with thee.\"  So I my suit preferr'd:  And she, so distant, as appear'd, look'd down,  And smil'd; then tow'rds th' eternal fountain turn'd.    And thus the senior, holy and rever'd:  \"That thou at length mayst happily conclude  Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch'd,  By supplication mov'd and holy love)  Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,  This garden through: for so, by ray divine  Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;  And from heav'n's"]]]
