Boys  ought to be thinking about keeping themselves fit and being good at  games. Which reminds me. Let's have a look at the wrist.\"    A hunted expression came into Mike's eyes.    \"It's really nothing,\" he began, but his uncle had already removed the  sling, and was examining the arm with the neat rapidity of one who has  been brought up to such things.    To Mike it seemed as if everything in the world was standing still and  waiting. He could hear nothing but his own breathing.    His uncle pressed the wrist gingerly once or twice, then gave it a  little twist.    \"That hurt?\" he asked.    \"Ye--no,\" stammered Mike.    Uncle John looked up sharply. Mike was crimson.    \"What's the game?\" inquired Uncle John.    Mike said nothing.    There was a twinkle in his uncle's eyes.    \"May as well tell me. I won't give you away. Why this wounded warrior  business when you've no more the matter with you than I have?\"    Mike hesitated.    \"I only wanted to get out of having to write this morning. There was  an exam, on.\"    The idea had occurred to him just before he spoke. It had struck him  as neat and plausible.    To Uncle John it did not appear in the same light.    \"Do you always write with your left hand? And if you had gone with the  first eleven to Geddington, wouldn't that have got you out of your  exam? Try again.\"    When in doubt, one may as well tell the truth. Mike told it.    \"I know. It wasn't that, really. Only----\"    \"Well?\"    \"Oh, well, dash it all then. Old Bob got me out of an awful row the  day before yesterday, and he seemed a bit sick at not playing for the  first, so I thought I might as well let him. That's how it was. Look  here, swear you won't tell him.\"    Uncle John was silent. Inwardly he was deciding that the five  shillings which he had intended to bestow on Mike on his departure  should become a sovereign. (This, it may be mentioned as an  interesting biographical fact, was the only occasion in his life  on which Mike earned money at the rate of fifteen shillings a  half-minute.)    \"Swear you won't tell him. He'd be most frightfully sick if he knew.\"    \"I won't tell him.\"    Conversation dwindled to vanishing-point. Uncle John smoked on in  weighty silence, while Mike, staring up at the blue sky through the  branches of the willow, let his mind wander to Geddington, where his  fate was even now being sealed. How had the school got on? What had  Bob done? If he made about twenty, would they give him his cap?  Supposing....    A faint snore from Uncle John broke in on his meditations. Then there  was a clatter as a briar pipe dropped on to the floor of the boat, and  his uncle sat up, gaping.    \"Jove, I was nearly asleep. What's the time? Just on six? Didn't know  it was so late.\"    \"I ought to be getting back soon, I think. Lock-up's at half-past.\"    \"Up with the anchor, then. You can tackle that rope with two hands  now, eh? We are not observed. Don't fall overboard. I'm going to shove  her off.\"    \"There'll be another telegram, I should think,\" said Mike, as they  reached the school gates.    \"Shall we go and look?\"    They walked to the shop.    A second piece of grey paper had been pinned up under the first. Mike  pushed his way through the crowd. It was a longer message this time.    It ran as follows:       \"Geddington 247 (Burgess six wickets, Neville-Smith four).     Wrykyn 270 for nine (Berridge 86, Marsh 58, Jackson 48).\"    Mike worked his way back through the throng, and rejoined his uncle.    \"Well?\" said Uncle John.    \"We won.\"    He paused for a moment.    \"Bob made forty-eight,\" he added carelessly.    Uncle John felt in his pocket, and silently slid a sovereign into  Mike's hand.    It was the only possible reply.          CHAPTER XVII    ANOTHER VACANCY      Wyatt got back late that night, arriving at the dormitory as Mike was  going to bed.    \"By Jove, I'm done,\" he said. \"It was simply baking at Geddington. And  I came back in a carriage with Neville-Smith and Ellerby, and they  ragged the whole time. I wanted to go to sleep, only they wouldn't let  me. Old Smith was awfully bucked because he'd taken four wickets. I  should think he'd go off his nut if he took eight ever. He was singing  comic songs when he wasn't trying to put Ellerby under the seat. How's  your wrist?\"    \"Oh, better, thanks.\"    Wyatt began to undress.    \"Any colours?\" asked Mike after a pause. First eleven colours were  generally given in the pavilion after a match or on the journey home.    \"No. Only one or two thirds. Jenkins and Clephane, and another chap,  can't remember who. No first, though.\"    \"What was Bob's innings like?\"    \"Not bad. A bit lucky. He ought to have been out before he'd scored,  and he was out when he'd made about sixteen, only the umpire didn't  seem to know that it's l-b-w when you get your leg right in front of  the wicket and the ball hits it. Never saw a clearer case in my life.  I was in at the other end. Bit rotten for the Geddington chaps. Just  lost them the match. Their umpire, too. Bit of luck for Bob. He didn't  give the ghost of a chance after that.\"    \"I should have thought they'd have given him his colours.\"    \"Most captains would have done, only Burgess is so keen on fielding  that he rather keeps off it.\"    \"Why, did he field badly?\"    \"Rottenly. And the man always will choose Billy's bowling to drop  catches off. And Billy would cut his rich uncle from Australia if he  kept on dropping them off him. Bob's fielding's perfectly sinful. He  was pretty bad at the beginning of the season, but now he's got so  nervous that he's a dozen times worse. He turns a delicate green when  he sees a catch coming. He let their best man off twice in one over,  off Billy, to-day; and the chap went on and made a hundred odd.  Ripping innings bar those two chances. I hear he's got an average of  eighty in school matches this season. Beastly man to bowl to. Knocked  me off in half a dozen overs. And, when he does give a couple of easy  chances, Bob puts them both on the floor. Billy wouldn't have given  him his cap after the match if he'd made a hundred. Bob's the sort of  man who wouldn't catch a ball if you handed it to him on a plate, with  watercress round it.\"    Burgess, reviewing the match that night, as he lay awake in his  cubicle, had come to much the same conclusion. He was very fond of  Bob, but two missed catches in one over was straining the bonds of  human affection too far. There would have been serious trouble between  David and Jonathan if either had persisted in dropping catches off the  other's bowling. He writhed in bed as he remembered the second of the  two chances which the wretched Bob had refused. The scene was  indelibly printed on his mind. Chap had got a late cut which he  fancied rather. With great guile he had fed this late cut. Sent down a  couple which he put to the boundary. Then fired a third much faster  and a bit shorter. Chap had a go at it, just as he had expected: and  he felt that life was a good thing after all when the ball just  touched the corner of the bat and flew into Bob's hands. And Bob  dropped it!    The memory was too bitter. If he dwelt on it, he felt, he would get  insomnia. So he turned to pleasanter reflections: the yorker which had  shattered the second-wicket man, and the slow head-ball which had led  to a big hitter being caught on the boundary. Soothed by these  memories, he fell asleep.    Next morning he found himself in a softened frame of mind. He thought  of Bob's iniquities with sorrow rather than wrath. He felt towards him  much as a father feels towards a prodigal son whom there is still a  chance of reforming. He overtook Bob on his way to chapel.    Directness was always one of Burgess's leading qualities.    \"Look here, Bob. About your fielding. It's simply awful.\"    Bob was all remorse.    \"It's those beastly slip catches. I can't time them.\"    \"That one yesterday was right into your hands. Both of them were.\"    \"I know. I'm frightfully sorry.\"    \"Well, but I mean, why _can't_ you hold them? It's no good being  a good bat--you're that all right--if you're going to give away runs  in the field.\"    \"Do you know, I believe I should do better in the deep. I could get  time to watch them there. I wish you'd give me a shot in the deep--for  the second.\"    \"Second be blowed! I want your batting in the first. Do you think  you'd really do better in the deep?\"    \"I'm almost certain I should. I'll practise like mad. Trevor'll hit me  up catches. I hate the slips. I get in the dickens of a funk directly  the bowler starts his run now. I know that if a catch does come, I  shall miss it. I'm certain the deep would be much better.\"    \"All right then. Try it.\"    The conversation turned to less pressing topics.           *       *       *       *       *    In the next two matches, accordingly, Bob figured on the boundary,  where he had not much to do except throw the ball back to the bowler,  and stop an occasional drive along the carpet. The beauty of fielding  in the deep is that no unpleasant surprises can be sprung upon one.  There is just that moment or two for collecting one's thoughts which  makes the whole difference. Bob, as he stood regarding the game from  afar, found his self-confidence returning slowly, drop by drop.    As for Mike, he played for the second, and hoped for the day.           *       *       *       *       *    His opportunity came at last. It will be remembered that on the  morning after the Great Picnic the headmaster made an announcement in  Hall to the effect that, owing to an outbreak of chicken-pox in the  town, all streets except the High Street would be out of bounds. This  did not affect the bulk of the school, for most of the shops to which  any one ever thought of going were in the High Street. But there were  certain inquiring minds who liked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#18)"],[1,"sure.    But the story he liked best was the \"Sleeping Beauty in the Wood;\" for  he was sure some lovely creature lived in that garden, and he longed to  get in to find and play with her. He actually planted a bean in a bit of  damp earth behind the water-barrel, and watched it grow, hoping for as  strong a ladder as Jack's. But the vine grew very slowly, and Johnny  was so impatient that he promised Patsey his best book \"for his  ownty-donty,\" if he would climb up and report what was to be seen in  that enchanted garden.    \"Faix, and I will, thin.\" And up went good-natured Pat, after laying an  old board over the hogshead to stand on; for there were spikes all along  the top of the wall, and only cats and sparrows could walk there.    Alas for Johnny's eager hopes, and alas for Pat's Sunday best! The board  broke, and splash went the climber, with a wild Irish howl that startled  Johnny half out of his wits and brought both Mrs. Morris and the cobbler  to the rescue.    After this sad event Pat kept away for a time in high dudgeon, and  Johnny was more lonely than ever. But he was a cheery little soul, so he  was grateful for what joys he had, and worked away at his wall,--for the  March winds had brought him many treasures, and after April rains were  over, May sunshine made the court warm enough for him to be out nearly  all day.    \"I'm so sorry Pat is mad, 'cause he saw this piece and told me about it,  and he'd like to help me put up these pictures,\" said Johnny to himself,  one breezy morning, as he sat examining a big poster which the wind had  sent flying into his lap a few minutes before.    The play was \"Monte Cristo,\" and the pictures represented the hero  getting out of prison by making holes in the wall, among other  remarkable performances.    \"This is a jolly red one! Now, where will I put it to show best and not  spoil the other beauties?\"    As he spoke, Johnny turned his chair around and surveyed his gallery  with as much pride and satisfaction as if it held all the wonders of  art.    It really _was_ quite splendid; for every sort of picture shone in the  sun,--simpering ladies, tragic scenes, circus parades, labels from  tin cans, rosy tomatoes, yellow peaches, and purple plums, funny  advertisements, and gay bills of all kinds. None were perfect, but they  were arranged with care; and the effect was very fine, Johnny thought.    Presently his eyes wandered from these treasures to the budding bushes  that nodded so tantalizingly over the wall. A grape-vine ran along the  top, trying to hide the sharp spikes; lilacs tossed their purple plumes  above it, and several tall chestnuts rose over all, making green tents  with their broad leaves, where spires of blossom began to show like  candles on a mammoth Christmas tree. Sparrows were chirping gayly  everywhere; the white cat, with a fresh blue bow, basked on the coping  of the wall, and from the depths of the enchanted garden came a sweet  voice singing,--      \"And she bids you to come in,      With a dimple in your chin,       Billy boy, Billy boy.\"    Johnny smiled as he listened, and put his finger to the little dent in  his own chin, wishing the singer would finish this pleasing song. But  she never did, though he often heard that, as well as other childish  ditties, sung in the same gay voice, with bursts of laughter and the  sound of lively feet tripping up and down the boarded walks. Johnny  longed intensely to know who the singer was; for her music cheered his  solitude, and the mysterious sounds he heard in the garden increased his  wonder and his longing day by day.    Sometimes a man's voice called, \"Fay, where are you?\" and Johnny was  sure \"Fay\" was short for Fairy. Another voice was often heard talking  in a strange, soft language, full of exclamations and pretty sounds. A  little dog barked, and answered to the name Pippo. Canaries carolled,  and some elfish bird scolded, screamed, and laughed so like a human  being, that Johnny felt sure that magic of some sort was at work next  door.    A delicious fragrance was now wafted over the wall as of flowers, and  the poor boy imagined untold loveliness behind that cruel wall, as he  tended the dandelions his mother brought him from the Common, when she  had time to stop and gather them; for he loved flowers dearly, and tried  to make them out of colored paper, since he could have no sweeter sort.    Now and then a soft, rushing sound excited his curiosity to such a pitch  that once he hobbled painfully up the court till he could see into the  trees; and once his eager eyes caught glimpses of a little creature, all  blue and white and gold, who peeped out from the green fans, and nodded,  and tried to toss him a cluster of the chestnut flowers. He stretched  his hands to her with speechless delight, forgetting his crutches, and  would have fallen if he had not caught by the shutter of a window so  quickly that he gave the poor back a sad wrench; and when he could look  up again, the fairy had vanished, and nothing was to be seen but the  leaves dancing in the wind.    Johnny dared not try this again for fear of a fall, and every step cost  him a pang; but he never forgot it, and was thinking of it as he sat  staring at the wall on that memorable May day.    \"How I _should_ like to peek in and see just how it all really looks!  It sounds and smells so summery and nice in there. I know it must be  splendid. I say, Pussy, can't you tell a feller what you see?\"    Johnny laughed as he spoke, and the white cat purred politely; for she  liked the boy who never threw stones at her, nor disturbed her naps. But  Puss could not describe the beauties of the happy hunting-ground below;  and, to console himself for the disappointment, Johnny went back to his  new picture.    \"Now, if this man in the play dug his way out through a wall ten feet  thick with a rusty nail and a broken knife, I don't see why I couldn't  pick away one brick and get a peek. It's all quiet in there now; here's  a good place, and nobody will know, if I stick a picture over the hole.  And I'll try it, I declare I will!\"    Fired with the idea of acting Monte Cristo on a small scale, Johnny  caught up the old scissors in his lap, and began to dig out the mortar  around a brick already loose, and crumbling at the corners. His mother  smiled at his energy, then sighed and said, as she clapped her laces  with a heavy heart,--    \"Ah, poor dear, if he only had his health he'd make his way in the  world. But now he's like to find a blank wall before him while he lives,  and none to help him over.\"    Puss, in her white boots, sat aloft and looked on, wise as the cat  in the story, but offered no advice. The toad who lived behind the  water-barrel hopped under the few leaves of the struggling bean, like  Jack waiting to climb; and just then the noon bells began to ring as if  they sang clear and loud,--    \"Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London.\"    So, cheered by his friends, Johnny scraped and dug vigorously till the  old brick fell out, showing another behind it. Only pausing to take  breath, he caught up his crutch and gave two or three hearty pokes,  which soon cleared the way and let the sunshine stream through, while  the wind tossed the lilacs like triumphal banners, and the jolly  sparrows chirped,--    \"Hail, the conquering hero comes!\"    Rather scared by his unexpected success, the boy sat silent for a moment  to see what would happen. But all was still; and presently, with a  beating heart, Johnny leaned forward to enjoy the long-desired \"peek.\"  He could not see much; but that little increased his curiosity and  delight, for it seemed like looking into fairy-land, after the dust and  noise and dingy houses of the court.    A bed of splendid tulips tossed their gay garments in the middle of a  grass-plot; a strange and brilliant bird sat dressing its feathers on  a golden cage; a little white dog dozed in the sun; and on a red carpet  under the trees lay the Princess, fast asleep.    \"It's all right,\" said Johnny, with a long sigh of pleasure; \"that's the  Sleeping Beauty, sure enough. There's the blue gown, the white fur-cloak  sweeping round, the pretty hair, and--yes--there's the old nurse,  spinning and nodding, just as she did in the picture-book mother got me  when I cried because I couldn't go to see the play.\"    This last discovery really did bewilder Johnny, and make him believe  that fairy tales _might_ be true, after all, for how could he know that  the strange woman was an Italian servant, in her native dress, with a  distaff in her hand? After pausing a moment, to rub his eyes, he took  another look, and made fresh discoveries by twisting his head about. A  basket of oranges stood near the Princess, a striped curtain hung from a  limb of the tree to keep the wind off, and several books fluttered their  pictured leaves temptingly before Johnny's longing eyes.    \"Oh, if I could only go in and eat 'em and read 'em and speak to 'em and  see all the splendid things!\" thought the poor boy, as he looked from  one delight to another, and felt shut out from all. \"I can't go and wake  her like the Prince did, but I do wish she'd get up and do something,  now I _can_ see. I daren't throw a stone, it might hit some one, or  holler, it might scare her. Pussy won't help, and the sparrows are too  busy scolding one another. I know! I'll fly a kite over, and that will  please her any way. Don't believe she has kites; girls never do.\"    Eager to carry out his plan, Johnny tied a long string to his gayest  poster, and then fastening it to the pole with which he sometimes fished  in the water-cask, held it up to catch the fresh breezes blowing down  the court. His good friend, the wind, soon caught the idea, and with  a strong breath sent the red paper whisking over the wall, to hang a  moment on the trees and then drop among the tulips, where its frantic  struggles to escape waked the dog, and set him to"]]]
