Clearly, therefore, she was at liberty  to bestow it upon a Devonshire convent if she chose. But this evidently  was not altogether her intention.    \"I told you how fond she was of her deformed godson, did I not? Being a  bundle of eccentricities, she had many hobbies, none more pronounced  than the fixed determination to see--before retiring from the world  altogether--David Graham happily married.    \"Now, it appears that David Graham, ugly, deformed, half-demented as he  was, had fallen desperately in love with Miss Edith Crawford, daughter  of the late Dr. Crawford, of Prince's Gardens. The young lady,  however--very naturally, perhaps--fought shy of David Graham, who, about  this time, certainly seemed very queer and morose, but Lady Donaldson,  with characteristic determination, seems to have made up her mind to  melt Miss Crawford's heart towards her unfortunate nephew.    \"On October the 2nd last, at a family party given by Mr. Graham in his  fine mansion in Charlotte Square, Lady Donaldson openly announced her  intention of making over, by deed of gift, to her nephew, David Graham,  certain property, money, and shares, amounting in total value to the sum  of L100,000, and also her magnificent diamonds, which were worth  L50,000, for the use of the said David's wife. Keith Macfinlay, a lawyer  of Prince's Street, received the next day instructions for drawing up  the necessary deed of gift, which she pledged herself to sign the day of  her godson's wedding.    \"A week later _The Scotsman_ contained the following paragraph:--    \"'A marriage is arranged and will shortly take place between David,  younger son of Andrew Graham, Esq., of Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, and  Dochnakirk, Perthshire, and Edith Lillian, only surviving daughter of  the late Dr. Kenneth Crawford, of Prince's Gardens.'    \"In Edinburgh society comments were loud and various upon the  forthcoming marriage, and, on the whole, these comments were far from  complimentary to the families concerned. I do not think that the Scotch  are a particularly sentimental race, but there was such obvious buying,  selling, and bargaining about this marriage that Scottish chivalry rose  in revolt at the thought.    \"Against that the three people most concerned seemed perfectly  satisfied. David Graham was positively transformed; his moroseness was  gone from him, he lost his queer ways and wild manners, and became  gentle and affectionate in the midst of this great and unexpected  happiness. Miss Edith Crawford ordered her trousseau, and talked of the  diamonds to her friends, and Lady Donaldson was only waiting for the  consummation of this marriage--her heart's desire--before she finally  retired from the world, at peace with it and with herself.    \"The deed of gift was ready for signature on the wedding day, which was  fixed for November 7th, and Lady Donaldson took up her abode temporarily  in her brother's house in Charlotte Square.    \"Mr. Graham gave a large ball on October 23rd. Special interest is  attached to this ball, from the fact that for this occasion Lady  Donaldson insisted that David's future wife should wear the magnificent  diamonds which were soon to become hers.    \"They were, it seems, superb, and became Miss Crawford's stately beauty  to perfection. The ball was a brilliant success, the last guest leaving  at four a.m. The next day it was the universal topic of conversation,  and the day after that, when Edinburgh unfolded the late editions of its  morning papers, it learned with horror and dismay that Lady Donaldson  had been found murdered in her room, and that the celebrated diamonds  had been stolen.    \"Hardly had the beautiful little city, however, recovered from this  awful shock, than its newspapers had another thrilling sensation ready  for their readers.    \"Already all Scotch and English papers had mysteriously hinted at  'startling information' obtained by the Procurator Fiscal, and at an  'impending sensational arrest.'    \"Then the announcement came, and every one in Edinburgh read,  horror-struck and aghast, that the 'sensational arrest' was none other  than that of Miss Edith Crawford, for murder and robbery, both so daring  and horrible that reason refused to believe that a young lady, born and  bred in the best social circle, could have conceived, much less  executed, so heinous a crime. She had been arrested in London at the  Midland Hotel, and brought to Edinburgh, where she was judicially  examined, bail being refused.\"          CHAPTER XV    A TERRIBLE PLIGHT      \"Little more than a fortnight after that, Edith Crawford was duly  committed to stand her trial before the High Court of Justiciary. She  had pleaded 'Not Guilty' at the pleading diet, and her defence was  entrusted to Sir James Fenwick, one of the most eminent advocates at the  Criminal Bar.    \"Strange to say,\" continued the man in the corner after a while, \"public  opinion from the first went dead against the accused. The public is  absolutely like a child, perfectly irresponsible and wholly illogical;  it argued that since Miss Crawford had been ready to contract a marriage  with a half-demented, deformed creature for the sake of his L100,000 she  must have been equally ready to murder and rob an old lady for the sake  of L50,000 worth of jewellery, without the encumbrance of so undesirable  a husband.    \"Perhaps the great sympathy aroused in the popular mind for David Graham  had much to do with this ill-feeling against the accused. David Graham  had, by this cruel and dastardly murder, lost the best--if not the  only--friend he possessed. He had also lost at one fell swoop the large  fortune which Lady Donaldson had been about to assign to him.    \"The deed of gift had never been signed, and the old lady's vast wealth,  instead of enriching her favourite nephew, was distributed--since she  had made no will--amongst her heirs-at-law. And now to crown this long  chapter of sorrow David Graham saw the girl he loved accused of the  awful crime which had robbed him of friend and fortune.    \"It was, therefore, with an unmistakable thrill of righteous  satisfaction that Edinburgh society saw this 'mercenary girl' in so  terrible a plight.    \"I was immensely interested in the case, and journeyed down to Edinburgh  in order to get a good view of the chief actors in the thrilling drama  which was about to be unfolded there.    \"I succeeded--I generally do--in securing one of the front seats among  the audience, and was already comfortably installed in my place in court  when through the trap door I saw the head of the prisoner emerge. She  was very becomingly dressed in deep black, and, led by two policemen,  she took her place in the dock. Sir James Fenwick shook hands with her  very warmly, and I could almost hear him instilling words of comfort  into her.    \"The trial lasted six clear days, during which time more than forty  persons were examined for the prosecution, and as many for the defence.  But the most interesting witnesses were certainly the two doctors, the  maid Tremlett, Campbell, the High Street jeweller, and David Graham.    \"There was, of course, a great deal of medical evidence to go through.  Poor Lady Donaldson had been found with a silk scarf tied tightly round  her neck, her face showing even to the inexperienced eye every symptom  of strangulation.    \"Then Tremlett, Lady Donaldson's confidential maid, was called. Closely  examined by Crown Counsel, she gave an account of the ball at Charlotte  Square on the 23rd, and the wearing of the jewels by Miss Crawford on  that occasion.    \"'I helped Miss Crawford on with the tiara over her hair,' she said;  'and my lady put the two necklaces round Miss Crawford's neck herself.  There were also some beautiful brooches, bracelets, and earrings. At  four o'clock in the morning when the ball was over, Miss Crawford  brought the jewels back to my lady's room. My lady had already gone to  bed, and I had put out the electric light, as I was going, too. There  was only one candle left in the room, close to the bed.    \"'Miss Crawford took all the jewels off, and asked Lady Donaldson for  the key of the safe, so that she might put them away. My lady gave her  the key and said to me, \"You can go to bed, Tremlett, you must be dead  tired.\" I was glad to go, for I could hardly stand up--I was so tired. I  said \"Good night!\" to my lady and also to Miss Crawford, who was busy  putting the jewels away. As I was going out of the room I heard Lady  Donaldson saying: \"Have you managed it, my dear?\" Miss Crawford said: \"I  have put everything away very nicely.\"'    \"In answer to Sir James Fenwick, Tremlett said that Lady Donaldson  always carried the key of her jewel safe on a ribbon round her neck, and  had done so the whole day preceding her death.    \"'On the night of the 24th,' she continued, 'Lady Donaldson still seemed  rather tired, and went up to her room directly after dinner, and while  the family were still sitting in the dining-room. She made me dress her  hair, then she slipped on her dressing-gown and sat in the arm-chair  with a book. She told me that she then felt strangely uncomfortable and  nervous, and could not account for it.    \"'However, she did not want me to sit with her, so I thought that the  best thing I could do was to tell Mr. David Graham that her ladyship did  not seem very cheerful. Her ladyship was so fond of Mr. David; it always  made her happy to have him with her. I then went to my room, and at  half-past eight Mr. David called me. He said: \"Your mistress does seem a  little restless to-night. If I were you I would just go and listen at  her door in about an hour's time, and if she has not gone to bed I would  go in and stay with her until she has.\" At about ten o'clock I did as  Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#19)"],[1,"war: another battle was a little after fought at Basing,  where the Danes were more successful; and being reinforced by a new  army from their own country, they became every day more terrible to  the English.  Amidst these confusions, Ethered died of a wound which  he had received in an action with the Danes; and left the inheritance  of his cares and misfortunes, rather than of his grandeur, to his  brother, Alfred, who was now twenty-two years of age.  [FN [g] Asser. p. 7.  W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 3.  Simeon Dunelm. p. 125.  Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 205.]    [MN Alfred 871.]  This prince gave very early marks of those great virtues and shining  talents, by which, during the most difficult times, he saved his  country from utter ruin and subversion.  Ethelwolf, his father, the  year after his return with Alfred from Rome, had again sent the young  prince thither with a numerous retinue; and a report being spread of  the king's death, the pope, Leo III., gave Alfred the royal unction  [h]; whether prognosticating his future greatness from the appearances  of his pregnant genius, or willing to pretend, even in that age, to  the right of conferring kingdoms.  Alfred, on his return home, became  every day more the object of his father's affections; but being  indulged in all youthful pleasures, he was much neglected in his  education; and he had already reached his twelfth year, when he was  yet totally ignorant of the lowest elements of literature.  His genius  was first roused by the recital of Saxon poems, in which the queen  took delight; and this species of erudition, which is sometimes able  to make a considerable progress even among barbarians, expanded those  noble and elevated sentiments which he had received from nature [i].  Encouraged by the queen, and stimulated by his own ardent inclination,  he soon learned to read those compositions; and proceeded thence to  acquire the knowledge of the Latin tongue, in which he met with  authors that better prompted his heroic spirit, and directed his  generous views.  Absorbed in these elegant pursuits, he regarded his  accession to royalty rather as an object of regret than of triumph  [k]; but being called to the throne, in preference to his brother's  children, as well by the will of his father, a circumstance which had  great authority with the Anglo-Saxons [l], as by the vows of the whole  nation, and the urgency of public affairs, he shook off his literary  indolence, and exerted himself in the defence of his people.  He had  scarcely buried his brother, when he was obliged to take the field in  order to oppose the Danes, who had seized Wilton, and were exercising  their usual ravages on the countries around.  He marched against them  with the few troops which he could assemble on a sudden; and giving  them battle, gained at first an advantage, but by his pursuing the  victory too far, the superiority of the enemy's numbers prevailed, and  recovered them the day.  Their loss, however, in the action, was so  considerable, that, fearing Alfred would receive daily reinforcement  from his subjects, they were content to stipulate for a safe retreat,  and promised to depart the kingdom.  For that purpose they were  conducted to London, and allowed to take up winter quarters there;  but, careless of their engagements, they immediately set themselves to  the committing of spoil on the neighbouring country.  Burrhed, King of  Mercia, in whose territories London was situated, made a new  stipulation with them, and engaged them, by presents of money, to  remove to Lindesey, in Lincolnshire, a country which they had already  reduced to ruin and desolation.  Finding therefore no object in that  place, either for their rapine or violence, they suddenly turned back  upon Mercia, in a quarter where they expected to find it without  defence; and fixing their station at Repton in Derbyshire, they laid  the whole country desolate with fire and sword.  Burrhed, despairing  of success against an enemy whom no force could resist, and no  treaties bind, abandoned his kingdom, and flying to Rome, took shelter  in a cloister [m].  He was brother-in-law to Alfred, and the last who  bore the title of king in Mercia.  [FN [h] Asser. p. 2.  W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2.  Ingulph. p. 869.  Simeon Dunelm. p. 120, 139.  [i] Asser. p. 5.  M. West. p. 167.  [k]  Asser. p. 7.  [1] Ibid. p. 22.  Simeon Dunelm. p. 121.  [m] Asser. p.  8.  Chron. Sax. p. 82.  Ethelward, lib. 4. cap. 4.]    The West Saxons were now the only remaining power in England; and  though supported by the vigour and abilities of Alfred, they were  unable to sustain the efforts of those ravagers, who from all quarters  invaded them. A new swarm of Danes came over this year under three  princes, Guthrum, Oscitel, and Amund; and having first joined their  countrymen at Repton, they soon found the necessity of separating, in  order to provide for their subsistence.  Part of them, under the  command of Haldene, their chieftain [n], marched into Northumberland,  where they fixed their quarters; part of them took quarters at  Cambridge, whence they dislodged in the ensuing summer, and seized  Wereham, in the county of Dorset, the very centre of Alfred's  dominions.  That prince so straitened them in these quarters, that  they were content to come to a treaty with him, and stipulated to  depart his country.  Alfred, well acquainted with their usual perfidy,  obliged them to swear upon the holy relics to the observance of the  treaty [o]; not that he expected they would pay any veneration to the  relics; but he hoped, that, if they now violated this oath, their  impiety would infallibly draw down upon them the vengeance of Heaven.  But the Danes, little apprehensive of the danger, suddenly, without  seeking any pretence, fell upon Alfred's army; and having put it to  rout, marched westward, and took possession of Exeter.  The prince  collected new forces, and exerted such vigour, that he fought in one  year eight battles with the enemy [p], and reduced them to the utmost  extremity.  He hearkened however to new proposals of peace; and was  satisfied to stipulate with them, that they would settle somewhere in  England [q], and would not permit the entrance of more ravagers into  the kingdom. But while he was expecting the execution of this treaty,  which it seemed the interest of the Danes themselves to fulfil, he  heard that another body had landed, and having collected all the  scattered troops of their countrymen, had surprised Chippenham, then a  considerable town, and were exercising their usual ravages all around  them.  [FN [n] Chron. Sax. p. 83.  [o] Asser. p. 8.  [p] Ibid.  The Saxon  Chronicle. p. 82, says nine battles.  [q] Asser. p. 9.  Alur. Beverl.  p. 104.]    This last incident quite broke the spirit of the Saxons, and reduced  them to despair.  Finding that, after all the miserable havoc which  they had undergone in their persons and in their property; after all  the vigorous actions which they had exerted in their own defence; a  new band, equally greedy of spoil and slaughter, had disembarked among  them; they believed themselves abandoned by Heaven to destruction, and  delivered over to those swarms of robbers, which the fertile north  thus incessantly poured forth against them.  Some left their country  and retired into Wales, or fled beyond sea: others submitted to the  conquerors, in hopes of appeasing their fury by a servile obedience  [r].  And every man's attention being now engrossed in concern for his  own preservation, no one would hearken to the exhortations of the  king, who summoned them to make, under his conduct, one effort more in  defence of their prince, their country, and their liberties.  Alfred  himself was obliged to relinquish the ensigns of his dignity, to  dismiss his servants, and to seek shelter, in the meanest disguises,  from the pursuit and fury of his enemies.  He concealed himself under  a peasant's habit, and lived some time in the house of a neat-herd,  who had been intrusted with the care of some of his cows [s].  There  passed here an incident, which has been recorded by all the  historians, and was long preserved by popular tradition; though it  contains nothing memorable in itself, except so far as every  circumstance is interesting which attends so much virtue and dignity  reduced to such distress.  The wife of the neat-herd was ignorant of  the condition of her royal guest; and observing him one day busy by  the fire-side in trimming his bows and arrows, she desired him to take  care of some cakes which were toasting, while she was employed  elsewhere in other domestic affairs.  But Alfred, whose thoughts were  otherwise engaged, neglected this injunction; and the good woman, on  her return, finding her cakes all burnt, rated the king very severely,  and upbraided him, that he always seemed very well pleased to eat her  warm cakes, though he was thus negligent in toasting them [t].  [FN [r] Chron. Sax. p. 84.  Alured Bever. p. 105.  [s] Asser. p. 9.  [t] Ibid  M. West, p. 170.]    By degrees, Alfred, as he found the search of the enemy become more  remiss, collected some of his retainers, and retired into the centre  of a bog, formed by the stagnating waters of the Thone and Parret, in  Somersetshire.  He here found two acres of firm ground; and building a  habitation on them, rendered himself secure by its fortifications, and  still more by the unknown and inaccessible roads which led to it, and  by the forests and morasses with which it was every way environed.  This place he called Aethelingay, or the Isle of Nobles [u]; and it  now bears the name of Athelney.  He thence made frequent and  unexpected sallies upon the Danes, who often felt the vigour of his  arm, but knew not from what quarter the blow came.  He subsisted  himself and his followers by the plunder which he acquired; he  procured them consolation by revenge; and from small successes he  opened their minds to"]]]
