But now I feel  quite ready for a holiday--quite out of harness. Now I feel just like  dancing, if I could only find partners.\"    Ameile did not know how to show greater honor to Barefoot than by  leading her about the house, as if she were a wealthy farmer's wife, and  showing her the large chest full of wedding presents in the bridal room.  She opened the tall, blue cabinets, which had the name and the date  painted upon them, and which were crammed full of linen and all sorts of  things, all tied up with ribbons of various colors and decorated with  artificial flowers. In the wardrobe there were at least thirty dresses,  and nearby were the high beds, the cradle, the distaff with its  beautiful spindles, and everywhere children's clothes were hanging,  presents from the bride's former playmates.    \"Oh, kind Heaven!\" cried Barefoot; \"how happy a child of such a house  must be!\"    \"Are you envious?\" said the farmer's wife; and then remembering that she  was showing all these things to a poor girl, she added: \"But believe me,  fine clothes are not all; there are many happier who do not get as much  as a stocking from their parents.\"    \"Yes, yes, I know that. I am not envious of the beautiful things, but  rather of the privilege that it gives your child to thank you and so  many good people for the lovely things she has received from them. Such  clothes from one's mother must keep one doubly warm.\"    The farmer's wife showed her fondness of Barefoot by accompanying the  girl as far as the yard, as she would have done to a visitor who had  eight horses in the stable.    There was already a great crowd of people assembled when Amrei arrived  at the dancing-floor. At first she stood timidly on the threshold. In  the empty courtyard, across which somebody hurried every now and then, a  solitary gendarme was pacing up and down. When he saw Amrei coming along  with a radiant face, he approached her and said:    \"Good morning, Amrei! Art thou here too?\"    Amrei started and turned quite pale. Had she done anything punishable?  Had she gone into the stable with a naked light? She thought of her past  life and could remember nothing; and yet he had addressed her as  familiarly as if he had already arrested her once. With these thoughts  flitting through her mind, she stood there trembling as if she were a  criminal, and at last answered:    \"Thank you. But I don't know why we should call each other 'thou.' Do  you want anything of me?\"    \"Oh, how proud you are. You can answer me properly. I am not going to  eat you up. Why are you so angry? Eh?\"    \"I am not angry, and I don't want to harm any one. I am only a foolish  girl.\"    \"Don't pretend to be so submissive--\"    \"How do you know what I am?\"    \"Because you flourish about so with that light.\"    \"What? Where? Where have I flourished about with a light? I always take  a lantern when I go out to the stable, but--\"    The gendarme laughed and said: \"I mean your brown eyes--that's where  the light is. Your eyes are like two balls of fire.\"    \"Then get out of my way, lest you get burnt. You might get blown up with  all that powder in your cartridge-box.\"    \"There's nothing in it,\" said the gendarme, embarrassed, but wishing to  make some kind of retort. \"But you have scorched me already.\"    \"I don't see where--you seem to be all right. But enough! Let me go.\"    \"I'm not keeping you, you little crib-biter. You could lead a man a hard  life, who was fond of you.\"    \"Nobody need be fond of me,\" said Amrei; and she rushed away as if she  had got loose from a chain.    She stood in the doorway where many spectators were crowded together. A  new dance was just beginning, and she swayed back and forth with the  music. The feeling that she had got the better of some one made her more  cheerful than ever, and she would have taken up arms against the whole  world, as well as against a single gendarme. But her tormentor soon  appeared again; he posted himself behind Amrei and said all kinds of  things to her. She made no answer and pretended not to hear him, every  now and then nodding to the people as they danced by, as if she had been  greeted by them. Only when the gendarme said:    \"If I were allowed to marry, I'd take you.\"    She replied:    \"Take me, indeed! But I shouldn't give myself!\"    The gendarme was glad to have at least got an answer from her, and  continued:    \"And if I were allowed to dance, I would have one with you right now.\"    \"I cannot dance,\" replied Amrei.    Just then the music ceased. Amrei pushed against the people in front of  her, and made her way in to seek some retired corner. She heard some one  behind her say:    \"Why, she can dance better than anybody in this part of the country!\"          CHAPTER X    ONLY A SINGLE DANCE      Down from the musicians' platform Crappy Zachy handed a glass to Amrei.  She took a sip, and handed it back; and Crappy Zachy said:    \"If you dance, Amrei, I'll play all my instruments so that the angels  will come down from the sky and join in.\"    \"Yes, but unless an angel comes down from the sky and asks me, I shall  not get a partner,\" said Amrei, half in fun and half in sorrow. And then  she began to wonder why there had to be a gendarme at a dance; but she  did not hold to this thought long, but immediately went on to say to  herself: \"After all, he is a man like anybody else, even though he has a  sword on; and before he became a gendarme, he was a lad like the rest.  It must be a plague for him that he can't dance. But what's that to me?  I, too, am obliged to be a mere spectator, and I don't get any money for  it.\"    For a short time things went on in a much more quiet and moderate manner  in the dancing-room. For the \"English woman,\" as Agy, the wife of  Severin, the building contractor, was still called, had come to the  dance with her children. The rich wood-merchants set the champagne corks  to popping and offered a glass to the English woman; she drank the  health of the young couple and then made each one happy by a gracious  word. A constant and complacent smile was lighting up the face of  everybody. Agy honored many a young fellow who drank to her from the  garlanded glasses, by sipping from hers in return. The old women, who  sat near Barefoot, were loud in their praises of the English woman, and  stood up a long time before she came when they saw her approaching to  speak a few words to them. When Agy had gone away, the rejoicing,  singing, dancing, stamping, and shouting broke out again with renewed  vigor.    Farmer Rodel's foreman now came toward Amrei, and she felt a thrill of  expectation. But the foreman said:    \"Here, Barefoot, take care of my pipe for me while I am dancing.\" And  after that several young girls from her village also came; from one she  received a jacket, from another a cap, or a neckerchief, or a door-key.  She let them hand it all over to her, and stood there with an  ever-increasing load as one dance followed another. All the time she  smiled quietly to herself, but nobody came to ask her to dance. Now a  waltz was being played, so smoothly that one could have swum to it. And  then a wild and furious galop; hurrah! now they are all hopping and  stamping and jumping and panting in supreme delight. And how their eyes  glitter! The old women who are sitting in the corner where Amrei is  standing, complain of the dust and heat; but still, they don't go home.  Then--suddenly Amrei starts; her eyes are fixed upon a handsome young  man who is walking proudly to and fro among the crowd. It is the rider  who had met her that morning, and whom she had snubbed in such a pert  way. All eyes are fastened upon him as he comes forward, his right hand  behind him, and his left holding a silver-mounted pipe. His silver  watch-chain bobs up and down, and how beautiful is his black velvet  jacket, and his loose black velvet trousers, and his red waistcoat! But  more beautiful still is his round head with its curly, brown hair. His  brow is white as snow; but from the eyes down his face is sunburnt, and  a light, full beard covers his chin and cheeks.    \"That's a bonny fellow,\" said one of the old women.    \"And what heavenly blue eyes he has!\" added another; \"they are at once  so roguish and so kind.\"    \"Where can he be from? He's not from this neighborhood,\" said a third.    And a fourth observed:    \"I'll wager he's another suitor for Amrei.\"    Barefoot started. What did this mean? What was that she said? But she  soon found out the meaning of it, for the first old lady resumed:    \"Then I'm sorry for him; for the Butter Countess makes fools of all the  men.\"    And so the Butter Countess's name was also Amrei.    The young stranger had passed through the room several times, turning  his eyes from one side to the other. Then he suddenly stopped not far  from Barefoot and beckoned to her. A hot flush overspread her face; she  stood riveted to the spot and did not move a muscle. No, he certainly  beckoned to somebody behind you; he cannot mean you. The stranger  pressed forward and Amrei made way for him. He must be looking for some  one else.    \"No, it's you I want,\" said the lad, taking Barefoot's hand. \"Will you  dance?\"    Amrei could not speak. But what need was there to speak? She threw  everything she had in her arms down into a corner--jackets,  neckerchiefs, caps, pipes, and door-keys--and stood there ready. The  lad threw a dollar up to the musicians; and when Crappy Zachy saw Amrei  on the arm of the stranger, he blew his trumpet until the very walls  trembled. And to the blessed souls above no music can sound more  beautiful than did this to Amrei. She danced she knew not how; she felt  as if she were being carried in the stranger's arms, as if she were  floating in the air, and there seemed to be no one else there. And,  indeed, they both danced so well, that everybody"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#19)"],[1,"the width of the village, talking of indifferent things,  then as they reached the last houses:    \"Go, then, dear friend,\" said Aramis, \"follow your own career. Fortune  lavishes her smiles upon you; do not let her flee from your embrace. As  for me, I remain in my humility and indolence. Adieu!\"    \"Thus 'tis quite decided,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that what I have to offer  to you does not tempt you?\"    \"On the contrary, it would tempt me were I any other man,\" rejoined  Aramis; \"but I repeat, I am made up of contradictions. What I hate  to-day I adore to-morrow, and vice versa. You see that I cannot, like  you, for instance, settle on any fixed plan.\"    \"Thou liest, subtile one,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"Thou alone, on  the contrary, knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it  stealthily.\"    The friends embraced. They descended into the plain by the ladder.  Planchet met them hard by the shed. D'Artagnan jumped into the saddle,  then the old companions in arms again shook hands. D'Artagnan and  Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris.    But after he had gone about two hundred steps D'Artagnan stopped short,  alighted, threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and  took the pistols from his saddle-bow to fasten them to his girdle.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Planchet.    \"This is the matter: be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his  dupe. Stand here, don't stir, turn your back to the road and wait for  me.\"    Having thus spoken, D'Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and  crossed the plain so as to wind around the village. He had observed  between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent  of the Jesuits, an open space surrounded by a hedge.    The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road.    He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it; in passing by the house  where the scene which we have related took place, he remarked that the  window was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not yet  returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be  alone.    In truth, in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers.    Close to the hedge the steps stopped.    D'Artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge.    Two men, to the astonishment of D'Artagnan, appeared shortly; soon,  however, his surprise vanished, for he heard the murmurs of a soft,  harmonious voice; one of these two men was a woman disguised as a  cavalier.    \"Calm yourself, dear Rene,\" said the soft voice, \"the same thing will  never happen again. I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage  which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the  marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet.\"    \"Oh!\" answered another voice, which D'Artagnan instantly recognized as  that of Aramis. \"I swear to you, princess, that if your reputation did  not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized----\"    \"Yes, yes! I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the  world, but you do not belong to me alone; you belong to all our party.  Be prudent! sensible!\"    \"I always obey, madame, when I am commanded by so gentle a voice.\"    He kissed her hand tenderly.    \"Ah!\" exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Aramis.    \"Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat?\"    Aramis rushed after the fugitive hat. D'Artagnan took advantage of the  circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick, where his glance  could penetrate to the supposed cavalier. At that instant, the moon,  inquisitive, perhaps, like D'Artagnan, came from behind a cloud and by  her light D'Artagnan recognized the large blue eyes, the golden hair and  the classic head of the Duchess de Longueville.    Aramis returned, laughing, one hat on his head and the other in his  hand; and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent.    \"Good!\" said D'Artagnan, rising and brushing his knees; \"now I have  thee--thou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longueville.\"          10. Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.      Thanks to what Aramis had told him, D'Artagnan, who knew already that  Porthos called himself Du Vallon, was now aware that he styled himself,  from his estate, De Bracieux; and that he was, on account of this  estate, engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon. It was, then, in  the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate. His itinerary  was promptly determined: he would go to Dammartin, from which place two  roads diverge, one toward Soissons, the other toward Compiegne; there he  would inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to  the left according to the information obtained.    Planchet, who was still a little concerned for his safety after his  recent escapade, declared that he would follow D'Artagnan even to the  end of the world, either by the road to the right or by that to the  left; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening, for  greater security to himself. D'Artagnan suggested that he should send  word to his wife, so that she might not be anxious about him, but  Planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would  not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was, while he, Planchet,  remembering her incontinence of tongue, would die of anxiety if she did  know.    This reasoning seemed to D'Artagnan so satisfactory that he no further  insisted; and about eight o'clock in the evening, the time when the  vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets, he left the Hotel de la  Chevrette, and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital by way of  the Saint Denis gate.    At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin, but it was then too  late to make inquiries--the host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to  bed.    The next morning D'Artagnan summoned the host, one of those sly Normans  who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a  direct answer. D'Artagnan, however, gathered from his equivocal replies  that the road to the right was the one he ought to take, and on that  uncertain information he resumed his journey. At nine in the morning he  reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast. His host here was a good  fellow from Picardy, who gave him all the information he needed. The  Bracieux estate was a few leagues from Villars-Cotterets.    D'Artagnan was acquainted with Villars-Cotterets, having gone thither  with the court on several occasions; for at that time Villars-Cotterets  was a royal residence. He therefore shaped his course toward that place  and dismounted at the Dauphin d'Or. There he ascertained that the  Bracieux estate was four leagues distant, but that Porthos was not at  Bracieux. Porthos had, in fact, been involved in a dispute with the  Bishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property, which adjoined  his own, and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his  comprehension, he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added  that name to his others. He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de  Pierrefonds, and resided on his new estate.    The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next  day; the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest. It is  true they might have taken others, but there was a great forest to pass  through and Planchet, as we have seen, had no liking for forests after  dark.    There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was  starting on a journey with a hungry stomach. Accordingly, D'Artagnan, on  awaking, found his breakfast waiting for him. It need not be said that  Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former  humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by  D'Artagnan.    It was nearly eight o'clock when they set out again. Their course was  clearly defined: they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on  emerging from the forest turn to the right.    The morning was beautiful, and in this early springtime the birds sang  on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades, like  curtains of golden gauze.    In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through  the foliage, and the stems of two old oak trees, the refuge of the  squirrel, startled by the travelers, were in deep shadow.    There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs,  flowers and leaves, which delighted the heart. D'Artagnan, sick of the  closeness of Paris, thought that when a man had three names of his  different estates joined one to another, he ought to be very happy in  such a paradise; then he shook his head, saying, \"If I were Porthos and  D'Artagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to  him, I know what I should say to it.\"    As to Planchet, he thought of little or nothing, but was happy as a  hunting-hound in his old master's company.    At the extremity of the wood D'Artagnan perceived the road that had been  described to him, and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an  immense feudal castle.    \"Oh! oh!\" he said, \"I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch  of Orleans. Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de  Longueville?\"    \"Faith!\" exclaimed Planchet, \"here's land in good condition; if it  belongs to Monsieur Porthos I wish him joy.\"    \"Zounds!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"don't call him Porthos, nor even Vallon;  call him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds; thou wilt knell out damnation to  my mission otherwise.\"    As he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye,  D'Artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend  dwelt; the towers, though solid and as if built yesterday, were open and  broken. One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with  blows from a hatchet.    On"]]]
