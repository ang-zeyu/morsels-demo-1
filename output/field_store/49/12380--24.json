After passing through the cicatricial tissue (the amount of which tissue,  of course, controls the length of time that insensibility remains), the  growing axis-cylinders reach the degenerated portions of the nerve below  the point of section. It is along the track of the old nerve that the new  growths from the stump reproduce themselves.    The fact of the new growths having to pass through the fibrous tissue of  the cicatrix before they can gain the course of the old nerve, along which  latter their progress of growth is comparatively easy, affords ample  illustration that as large a portion as is possible of the nerve should be  removed when operating, in order to convey insensibility for the longest  time. After reunion, of course, nothing remains but to repeat the  operation.    _The Existence of an Adventitious Nerve-supply_.--While not exactly a  sequel of the operation, the fact that it is not discovered until after the  operation has been performed warrants us in mentioning it here. It is  not an uncommon thing in the lower operation to find that sensation and  symptoms of lameness still persist after section of the nerve. In many  cases this has been traced to the existence of an abnormal nerve branch.  In the higher operation this is not so likely to be met with. That it may  occur, however, is shown by the following interesting case related by  Harold Sessions, F.R.C.V.S.:[A]    [Footnote A: _Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics_, vol.  xii., p. 343.]    'In June of 1898 I saw a hunter suffering from navicular disease. After  carefully examining the leg, I advised the owner to have the operation of  neurectomy performed upon him. This he decided to do, and the horse was  sent to me about the beginning of July.    [Illustration: FIG. 62.--DISSECTED EXTERNAL METACARPAL NERVE AND BRANCHES.  _a_, Metacarpal; _b_, anterior plantar; _c_, extra branch (probably from  the internal metacarpal), conveying sensation after division of the  external metacarpal.]    'The operation was performed in the ordinary way, without any difficulty  whatever. The wounds healed nicely, but the horse still continued to go  lame. Careful examination showed that there was still sensation on the  outside of the foot. Thinking that possibly there might be two external  metacarpal nerves, the horse was again cast, the operation being performed  slightly lower down. Only the main branch of the external metacarpal nerve  could be found. A piece of this was taken out, and the horse let up. On  examination, sensation was still found in the posterior part of the outside  of the foot. It was very evident that there was some abnormal distribution  of the nerve, as sensation was still being conveyed to that part of the  foot.    'As the horse was absolutely useless, and would have to be shot unless this  piece of nerve could be found, he was again thrown, and after he had been  anaesthetized I determined to follow the course of the nerve down, until I  found where the accessory branch came from. This I found a little below the  fetlock, about 1/2 inch below the point where the anterior plantar nerve is  given off from the metacarpal nerve. It was about 1/2 inch below the spot  where the anterior plantar nerve passes between the artery and vein of the  foot, and it was somewhat difficult to get at it.    'Fig. 62 shows the exact size and distribution of the nerves. After the  separation of the accessory branch, sensation was taken from the foot, and  the horse went perfectly sound.'    _Stumbling_.--In addition to the sequelae we have mentioned, it is urged  against the operation of neurectomy that one of the first effects of  depriving the foot of the sense of touch is a tendency on the part of  the animal to stumble. From the cases we have seen we cannot regard  this objection as a serious one. Nevertheless, as veterinarians, with a  knowledge of the physiology of the structures with which we are dealing,  we must treat the objection with respect, for, after all, we are bound to  allow that stumbling, and a bad form of it, would be but a natural sequence  of the operation we have just performed. The real fact remains, however,  that cases of stumbling, even immediately after the operation, are  rare; and that even when they do occur, the animal seems easily able to  accommodate himself to the altered condition, and as readily uses the  comparatively inert mass at the end of his limb as he did previously the  intact foot.      H. ADVANTAGES OF THE OPERATION.    From the prominence we have given to the unfortunate sequelae of the  operation it might possibly be inferred that, while not giving it our  absolute condemnation, we regard neurectomy with a certain amount of  distrust. That we may contradict any such false impression, we state here  that in many cases the operation is the only measure which will offer  relief from pain, and restore to work an otherwise useless animal. In  support of that we will now quote the recognised advantages of the  operation.    That in many cases, when all other methods--surgical and medicinal--have  failed, there is an immediate and total freedom from pain and lameness no  one will deny. This, if it restores to active work an animal that would  otherwise have had to have been cast aside, is ample justification for  giving the operation, in spite of its many unfortunate terminations, a real  place among the more highly favoured remedial measures to our hand.    'For _Contracted Hoofs_, viewing them in the light of idiopathic disease,  or as being the immediate cause of the existing lameness in the uninflamed  condition of the foot, and when consequential changes of its organism have  taken place which bid defiance to therapeutic measures, _neurotomy_ is a  _warrantable resource_' (Percival).    'For _Ringbone_ neurotomy has been practised with perfect success, after  blistering and firing had both failed, notwithstanding the work the animal  had to perform afterwards was of the most trying nature' (_ibid_.).    For _Navicular Disease_, when that malady is diagnosed, the earlier  neurectomy is performed the better. The greater work given to the diseased  bursa and bone, and the return of the contracted heels to the normal,  brought about by the greater freedom with which the foot is used, are  claimed by many to effect a cure.    Writing of navicular disease, and mentioning his belief in the possibility  of the diseased bone effecting its own repair after the operation, Harold  Leeney, M.R.C.V.S., says:    'The expansion of the heel, and rapid development of the frog (in this and  many other cases) immediately after the operation, has not, I venture to  think, attracted so much attention as it deserves, and may have something  to do with those cases which appear to be actually _cured_, not merely made  to go sound by absence of pain.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Veterinary Record_, vol. xi., p. 297.]    Speaking of the median operation before a meeting of the Central Veterinary  Medical Society, Professor Hobday says:[A]    [Footnote A: _Veterinary Record_, vol. xiii., p. 427.]    'For old-standing lamenesses, when due to splints, exostoses, chronically  sprained, thickened, and painful perforans and perforatus tendons, or cases  of that kind which cause pain by pressing on the adjacent nerve structures,  after all other known methods have failed, median neurectomy is the  operation which will be most likely to give the animal a new lease of life  and usefulness.'    'Of the _Humanity and Utility of Neurectomy_ there can be no question  whatever, and provided the cases are well selected, and the operation  is efficiently performed, the advantages to be derived from it are most  striking as well as enduring. But the disadvantages attending the loss of  sensation in the foot have been brought forward on many occasions as  an argument against neurectomy, and no one can deny that the foot with  sensation is better than one without that faculty. But in a long experience  of the operation I have never found these disadvantages outweigh the great  advantages which have immediately followed it.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Veterinary Journal_, vol. ix., p. 178 (Fleming).]    Beyond these, the direct advantages of neurectomy, are other and more  indirect advantages which claim attention.    The most astonishing among them is the fact noted by many writers of repute  that exostoses (ringbones, side-bones, splints, etc.) rapidly diminish in  size. This is vouched for by such well-known authorities as Zundel and  Nocard.    Percival, too, mentions at some length the effect of the removal of pain on  the oestral and generative functions, quoting a case of a brood cart-mare  by reason of bony deposits being stayed from breeding for some years. Two  months after the operation she went to work, and moved sound, her altered  condition leading her to breed several healthy foals.      I. THE USE OF THE HORSE THAT HAS UNDERGONE NEURECTOMY.    No operation is of any considerable value to the veterinary surgeon unless  he is able to show that after it he has left his patient workable. The  alleviation of pain alone, commendable as it is from a humanitarian  standpoint, is of no interest to the average owner of horse-flesh, unless  with it he sees his animal capable of justifying his existence by the  amount of labour performed.    Criticised in this way, is the operation of neurectomy justifiable? Upon  that point the opinions of many practitioners, even at the present day,  differ. We have already partly answered the objections likely to be raised  on this score by stating that the work afterwards allotted the animal  should be fixed to suit his altered condition. It may be taken as a general  rule that in all cases where the animal's usefulness depends upon his  delicacy of touch, as, for example, animals used solely for hacking or  hunting, his future usefulness in that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#19)"],[1,"more  scrupulous in the performance of their religious duties, they  are not in any measure under the control or the dictation of  their mullahs. They have their own schools, called kuttebs, they  take care of their own poor very largely; drunkenness and gambling  are very rare among them. They are hospitable, kind to animals  and generous. The difference between the Mohammedans and the  Hindus may be seen in the most forcible manner in their temples.  It is an old saying that while one god created all men, each  man creates his own god, and that is strikingly true among the  ignorant, superstitious people of the East. The Hindu crouches in  a shadow to escape the attention of his god, while the Mohammedan  publicly prays to his five times a day in the nearest mosque,  and if no mosque is near he kneels where he stands, and takes  full satisfaction in a religion of hope instead of fear.    From the political standpoint the Mohammedans are a very important  factor in the situation in India. They are more independent than the  Hindus; they occupy a more influential position than their numbers  entitle them to; they have most profound pride in their religion  and race, and in their social and intellectual superiority, and  the more highly they are educated the more manly, self-reliant and  independent they become, and the feeling between the Mohammedans  and the Hindus is bitterly hostile. So much so as to make them  a bulwark of the government. Several authorities told me that  Mohammedans make the best officials in the service and can be  trusted farther than any other class, but, speaking generally,  Islam has been corrupted and debased in India just as it has  been everywhere else.    One of the results of this corruption is the sect known as Sikhs,  which numbers about 2,195,268. It thrives best in the northern  part of India, and furnishes the most reliable policemen and  the best soldiers for the native army. The Sikhs retain much  that is good among the teachings of Mohammed, but have a bible  of their own, called the Abi-granth, made up of the sermons of  Nanak, the founder of the sect, who died in the year 1530. It  is full of excellent moral precepts; it teaches the brotherhood  of man, the equality of the sexes; it rejects caste, and embraces  all of the good points in Buddhism, with a pantheism that is  very confusing. It would seem that the Sikhs worship all gods  who are good to men, and reject the demonology of the Hindus.  They believe in one Supreme Being, with attributes similar to the  Allah of the Mohammedans, and recognize Mohammed as his prophet  and exponent of his will. They have also adopted several Hindu  deities in a sort of indirect way, although the Sikhs strictly  prohibit idolatry. Their worship is pure and simple. Their temples  are houses of prayer, where they, meet, sing hymns, repeat a  ritual and receive pieces of \"karah prasad,\" a consecrated pastry,  which means \"the effectual offering.\" They are tolerant, and  not only admit strangers to their worship, but invite them to  participate in their communion.    The morning we arrived in Agra we swallowed a hasty breakfast  and hurried off to the great mosque to witness the ceremonies  of what might be termed the Mohammedan Easter, although the  anniversary has an entirely different significance. The month  of Ramadan is spent by the faithful followers of the Prophet  in a long fast, and the night before it is broken, called  Lailatul-Kadr, or \"night of power,\" is celebrated in rejoicing,  because it is the night on which the Koran is supposed to have  come down from heaven. In the morning following, which is as  much a day of rejoicing as our Christmas, the men of Islam gather  at the mosques and engage in a service of thanksgiving to Allah  for the blessings they and their families have enjoyed during  the year past, and pray for a repetition of the same mercies for  the year to come. This festival is called the \"Idu I-Fitr,\" and  we were fortunate enough to witness one of the most impressive  spectacles I have ever seen. Women never appear, but the entire  male population, with their children assembled at the great park  which surrounds the mosque, clad in festival attire, each bringing  a prayer rug to spread upon the ground. About ten thousand persons  of all ages and all classes came on foot and in all sorts of  vehicles, with joyous voices and congratulations to each other  that seemed hearty enough to include the whole world. Taking  advantage of their good humor and the thankful spirits hundreds  of beggars were squatting along the roadside and appealing to  every passerby in pitiful tones. And nearly everyone responded.  Some people brought bags of rice, beans and wheat; others brought  cakes and bread, but the greater number invested in little sea  shells which are used in the interior of India as currency, and  one hundred of them are worth a penny.    Rich people filled their pockets with these shells and scattered  them by handsful among the crowd, and the shrieking beggars scrambled  for them on the ground. There were long lines of food peddlers,  with portable stoves, and tables upon which were spread morsels  which the natives of India considered delicacies, but they were  not very tempting to us. The food peddlers drove a profitable  trade because almost every person present had been fasting for  a lunar month and had a sharp appetite to satisfy. After the  services the rich and the poor ate together, masters and servants,  because Mohammed knew no caste, and it was an interesting sight  to see the democratic spirit of the worshipers, for the rich  and the poor, the master and the servant, knelt down side by  side upon the same rug or strip of matting and bowed their heads  to the ground in homage of the God that made them all. Families  came together in carriages, bullock carts, on the backs of camels,  horses, mules, donkeys, all the male members of the household  from the baby to the grandfather, and were attended by all men  servants of the family or the farm. They washed together at the  basins where the fountains were spouting more joyously than usual,  and then moved forward, laughing and chattering, toward the great  mosque, selected places which seemed most convenient, spread  their rugs, matting, blankets and sheets upon the ground, sat in  long rows facing Mecca, and gossiped cheerfully together until  the great high priest, surrounded by mullahs or lower priests,  appeared in front of the Midrab, the place in every mosque from  which the Koran is read, and shouted for attention.    Ram Zon, one of our \"bearers,\" who is a Mohammedan, disappeared  without permission or notice early in the morning, and did not  report for duty that day. His piety was greater than his sense of  obligation to his employers, and I saw him in the crowd earnestly  going through the violent exercise which attends the worship of  Islam.    [Illustration: MOHAMMEDANS AT PRAYER]    When the hour for commencing the ceremony drew near the entire  courtyard, several acres in extent, was covered with worshipers  arranged in rows about eight feet apart from north to south,  all facing the west, with their eyes toward Mecca in expectant  attitudes. The sheikh has a powerful voice, and by long experience  has acquired the faculty of throwing it a long distance, and,  as he intoned the service, mullahs were stationed at different  points to repeat his words so that everybody could hear. The  first sound was a long wailing cry like the call of the muezzeins  from the minarets at the hour of prayer. It was for the purpose  of concentrating the attention of the vast audience which arose  to its feet and stood motionless with hands clasped across their  breasts. Then, as the reading proceeded, the great crowd, in perfect  unison, as if it had practiced daily for months, performed the  same motions one after the other. It was a remarkable exhibition  of precision. No army of well drilled troops could have done  better.    The following were the motions, each in response to the intonation  of a prayer by the high priest:    1. Both hands to forehead, palms and fingers together, in the  attitude of prayer.    2. Bend body forward at right angles, three times in succession,  keeping hands in the same position.    3. Return to upright position, with hands lowered to the breast.    4. Bow head three times to the ground.    5. Rise and stand motionless with hands at sides.    6. Hands lifted to ears and returned to side, motions three times  repeated.    7. Body at right angles again, with hands clasped at forehead.    8. Body erect, kneel and bow forward, touching the forehead three  times to the earth.    9. Fall back upon knees and with folded hands.    10. Rise, stand at attention with clasped hands until the cry  of the mullah announced that the ceremony was over; whereupon  everybody turned to embrace his family and friends in a most  affectionate manner, again and again. Some were crying, some  were laughing, and all seemed to be in a state of suppressed  excitement. Their emotions had been deeply stirred, and long fasting  is apt to produce hysteria.    The boom of a cannon in a neighboring fortress, was a signal  that the obligations of Ramadan had been fulfilled, that the  fast was broken, and thousands of people rushed pell-mell to  the eating stands to gorge themselves with sweetmeats and other  food. The more dignified and aristocratic portion of the crowd  calmly sat down again upon their rugs and mats and watched their  servants unload baskets of provisions upon tablecloths, napkins  and trays which they spread upon the ground. Not less than seven  or eight thousand persons indulged in this picnic, but there was  no wine or beer; nothing stronger than tea or coffee, because  the Koran forbids it. And after their feast at the mosque the  rest of the day was spent in rejoicing. Gay banners of all colors  were displayed from the"]]]
