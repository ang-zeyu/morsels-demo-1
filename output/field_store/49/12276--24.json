[14] Pushkin.    The historical process Jewry has undergone repeatedly, it must undergo  once again. But now, too, in this blasting time of confusion and  dispersion, of daily torture and the horrors of international  conflict, \"the keeper of Israel slumbereth not and sleepeth not.\" The  Jewish spirit is on the alert. It is ever purging and tempering itself  in the furnace of suffering. The people which justly bears the name of  the veteran of history withdraws and falls into a revery. It is not a  narrow-minded fanatic's flight from the world, but the concentrated  thought of a mourner. Jewry is absorbed in contemplation of its great,  unparalleled past. More than ever it is now in need of the teachings  of its past, of the moral support and the prudent counsels of its  history, its four thousand years of life crowded with checkered  experiences.          XII    THE TEACHINGS OF JEWISH HISTORY      Let us return now to the starting point of our discussion, and  endeavor to establish the thoughts and lessons to be deduced from the  course of Jewish history.    Above all, Jewish history possesses the student with the conviction  that Jewry at all times, even in the period of political independence,  was pre-eminently a spiritual nation, and a spiritual nation it  continues to be in our own days, too. Furthermore, it inspires him  with the belief that Jewry, being a spiritual entity, cannot suffer  annihilation: the body, the mold, may be destroyed, the spirit is  immortal. Bereft of country and dispersed as it is, the Jewish nation  lives, and will go on living, because a creative principle permeates  it, a principle that is the root of its being and an indigenous  product of its history. This principle consists first in a sum of  definite religious, moral, or philosophic ideals, whose exponent at  all times was the Jewish people, either in its totality, or in the  person of its most prominent representatives. Next, this principle  consists in a sum of historical memories, recollections of what in the  course of many centuries the Jewish people experienced, thought, and  felt, in the depths of its being. Finally, it consists in the  consciousness that true Judaism, which has accomplished great things  for humanity in the past, has not yet played out its part, and,  therefore, may not perish. In short, the Jewish people lives because  it contains a living soul which refuses to separate from its  integument, and cannot be forced out of it by heavy trials and  misfortunes, such as would unfailingly inflict mortal injury upon less  sturdy organisms.    This self-consciousness is the source from which the suffering Jewish  soul draws comfort. History speaks to it constantly through the mouth  of the great apostle who went forth from the midst of Israel eighteen  hundred years ago: \"Call to remembrance the former days, in which,  after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;  partly, being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions;  and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.... Cast  not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of  reward\" (Epistle to the Hebrews, x, 32-34, 35).    Jewish history, moreover, arouses in the Jew the desire to work  unceasingly at the task of perfecting himself. To direct his attention  to his glorious past, to the resplendent intellectual feats of his  ancestors, to their masterly skill in thinking and suffering, does not  lull him to sleep, does not awaken a dullard's complacency or hollow  self-conceit. On the contrary, it makes exacting demands upon him.  Jewish history admonishes the Jews: \"_Noblesse oblige_. The  privilege of belonging to a people to whom the honorable title of the  'veteran of history' has been conceded, puts serious responsibilities  on your shoulders. You must demonstrate that you are worthy of your  heroic past. The descendants of teachers of religion and martyrs of  the faith dare not be insignificant, not to say wicked. If the long  centuries of wandering and misery have inoculated you with faults,  extirpate them in the name of the exalted moral ideals whose bearers  you were commissioned to be. If, in the course of time, elements out  of harmony with your essential being have fastened upon your mind,  cast them out, purify yourselves. In all places and at all times, in  joy and and in sorrow, you must aim to live for the higher, the  spiritual interests. But never may you deem yourselves perfect. If you  become faithless to these sacred principles, you sever the bonds that  unite you with the most vital elements of your past, with the first  cause of your national existence.\"    The final lesson to be learned is that in the sunny days of mankind's  history, in which reason, justice, and philanthropic instinct had the  upper hand, the Jews steadfastly made common cause with the other  nations. Hand in hand with them, they trod the path leading to  perfection. But in the dark days, during the reign of rude force,  prejudice, and passion, of which they were the first victims, the Jews  retired from the world, withdrew into their shell, to await better  days. Union with mankind at large, on the basis of the spiritual and  the intellectual, the goal set up by the Jewish Prophets in their  sublime vision of the future (Isaiah, ch. ii, and Micah, ch. iv), is  the ultimate ideal of Judaism's noblest votaries. Will their radiant  hope ever attain to realization? If ever it should be realized,--and  it is incumbent upon us to believe that it will,--not a slight part of  the merits involved will be due to Jewish history. We have adverted to  the lofty moral and humanitarian significance of Jewish history in its  role as conciliator. With regard to one-half of Jewish history, this  conciliatory power is even now a well-established fact. The first part  of Jewish history, the Biblical part, is a source from which, for many  centuries, millions of human beings belonging to the most diverse  denominations have derived instruction, solace, and inspiration. It is  read with devotion by Christians in both hemispheres, in their houses  and their temples. Its heroes have long ago become types, incarnations  of great ideas. The events it relates serve as living ethical  formulas. But a time will come--perhaps it is not very far off--when  the second half of Jewish history, the record of the two thousand  years of the Jewish people's life after the Biblical period, will be  accorded the same treatment. This latter part of Jewish history is not  yet known, and many, in the thrall of prejudice, do not wish to know  it. But ere long it will be known and appreciated. For the thinking  portion of mankind it will be a source of uplifting moral and  philosophical teaching. The thousand years' martyrdom of the Jewish  people, its unbroken pilgrimage, its tragic fate, its teachers of  religion, its martyrs, philosophers, champions, this whole epic will  in days to come sink deep into the memory of men. It will speak to the  heart and the conscience of men, not merely to their curious mind. It  will secure respect for the silvery hair of the Jewish people, a  people of thinkers and sufferers. It will dispense consolation to the  afflicted, and by its examples of spiritual steadfastness and  self-denial encourage martyrs in their devotion. It is our firm  conviction that the time is approaching in which the second half of  Jewish history will be to the noblest part of _thinking_ humanity  what its first half has long been to _believing_ humanity, a  source of sublime moral truths. In this sense, Jewish history in its  entirety is the pledge of the spiritual union between the Jews and the  rest of the nations."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7847"],[0,"Jack North's Treasure Hunt; Or, Daring Adventures in South America (#18)"],[1,"much risk in letting me have that amount.\"    \"I only wish you would take more, Jack.\"    \"I think I have hit on a better plan this time,\" said Jack, as he took the  loan. \"I am going to draw enough for a shipload down on the Bolivian coast  and house it there until an American ship comes into harbor.    \"I may have to wait a long time, but it will be best in the end.\"    With his oldtime vivacity Jack set out on his new undertaking. He soon  found a yoke of oxen to his liking, and finding he had money enough he  bought a second pair. Then he started for the mountain ridge where he had  so unceremoniously left his two loads of nitrate so long before.    He did not expect to recover the one that had gone over the precipice,  though it had not moved from its singular position. To his joy he found  the other just where he had left it. The rust had gathered on the iron-work  and the sun had discolored the wood, but the wagon was in running order,  and as the path from this point was generally descending he had no trouble  in drawing the load, though his team consisted of one yoke of oxen less  than before.    It would be tedious to follow him in his long, lonely journeys to Cobija,  on the coast of Bolivia, where he stored his nitrate until he had there  enough for a ship's cargo. During the time his cattle lived by feeding on  the grass that grew on the more fertile places along the route, while he  lived on whatever food he could pick up, sleeping at night under his cart.    He had no further use for his oxen, so he sold them at the first favorable  opportunity, realizing enough for them to pay back the money he had  borrowed of his friend, with a fair rate of interest. Surely he had made a  more auspicious beginning this time.          Chapter XXII    The Fate of Plum Plucky        It had been three months since Jack had seen Plum, so he resolved to go to  De la Pama and see his friend before making another move in his venture.  But he had not left town before he was surprised to meet his friend, who  had come to Cobija in search of him.    \"Lost my job and so I thought I would hunt you up,\" said the latter,  bluntly. \"Got a stunning piece of news for you, too. There is an American  brig ship just above here at the next town, and I made bold to ask him to  take your cargo to New York. He says he will do it for a snip in the  profits.\"    This was a bit of news worth hearing, and in the exuberance of his  spirits, Jack flung his cap high into the air and threw his arms about the  neck of his friend.    \"At last I believe my dream will be fulfilled, but I shall never forget it  was you who helped to accomplish it. But I want to pay the money I owe  you.\"    \"Not yet, Jack; better keep it awhile longer. I know it is safe. You may  need it you know. Besides I am going to the States with you. I have got  enough of this country. The war grows hotter and hotter up St. Resa way. I  am homesick!\"    Jack lost no time in seeing the captain of the brig, a man named  Hillgrove, and who gave our hero a most cordial greeting. He had been in  Bouton daring his adventurous career, though he could give Jack no  information of his friends. He knew John Fowler, the great engine builder,  and that simple fact gave him confidence in the young speculator, who must  have presented a not very favorable appearance to him.    Jack's long exposure to the tropical sun had fairly blackened his  countenance, his hair was long and unkempt, while his clothes were sadly  in need of repair, or more truthfully new ones to take their place. But  there was an honest frankness in his manner, and Captain Hillgrove entered  into the spirit of the venture with a hearty good-will. The bluff old sea  dog, too, true to his nature, was anxious to get out to sea again as soon  as possible.    \"I must and will get out of this infernal country within a week,\" he said.  \"So I will run down to Cobija as soon as possible, and if your nitrates is  on board by that time the old _Elizabeth_ will be good-natured.\"    Plum having decided to go home with Jack, it was necessary for him to  return to De la Pama for his money.    \"I will be back sure, Jack, on the third, if not before,\" were his parting  words.    Captain Hillgrove ran into Cobija the next morning, when the loading of  the nitrates was begun with as little delay as possible, Jack feeling in  the best of spirits as he superintended the work.    But on the eve of the third day, Jack having got the last of the cargo  aboard a little after noon, to his anxiety, Plum Plucky had not appeared.    \"He will surely come before morning, unless something has happened to him,  for I never knew Plum to break his word,\" said Jack to the skipper.    \"Can't wait any longer!\" declared captain Hillgrove the following morning,  when it was found that Plum was still missing. \"We shall all be  confiscated by these infernal Spaniards.\"    Jack was now really alarmed about his friend, whom he believed had been  waylaid and robbed. But he could not think of leaving without making a  search for him.    \"I am going to start for De la Pama to look for him, but you may expect me  back by sunset.\"    \"If you are not I shall set sail without you, for I have seen some of the  Chilian spies around today.\"    \"You need not wait any longer than sunset,\" said Jack, who could not blame  the other for his impatience.    Losing no more time, Jack mounted a fleet pony that he had hired at an  exorbitant price, and set out for De la Pama at a furious pace.    Toward noon he was gladdened by the sight of an inhabitant of the town  whom he knew, and who was on his way to Cobija.    Halting the Peruvian he inquired of him in regard to Plum. This fellow,  who knew Plum well, replied that he had seen him in town, and that he had  left two days before. Upon second thought, he volunteered the startling  information that news had come of an American being waylaid and killed by  a party of bush-raiders a dozen miles east of De la Pama!    \"Did the young engineer start directly for Cobija?\" asked Jack anxiously.    \"No; he went toward the east, saying he wished to go to Don de Estuaray  before he went to Cobija.\"    This was sufficient to arouse the fears of Jack, who procured a fresh  horse and put on as rapidly as possible across the wild country toward the  estancia of Don de Estuaray.    All the afternoon he rode as fast as he could, but he saw nothing of his  missing friend. In his anxiety he halted on top of an eminence of land  commanding a wide view of the surrounding country, to scan the lonely  scene.    His attention was finally caught and held by the flight of one of those  enormous vultures of the Andes, which was descrying a circle in the air  directly over the valley at his feet. Smaller and smaller grew the orbit  of this dark bird while he watched, until suddenly it ended its gyrations  and swooped swiftly down out of sight.    Then a second took its place in the air, soon following it to the earth,  in turn succeeded by a third, and that by another, and so on, until a  dozen had come and gone in this mysterious way.    With a dread foreboding at his heart, Jack rode forward into the isolated  valley, when, from a small opening in the centre of the place the sudden  whir of wings and the rapid flight of many dark bodies told him the secret  of it all.    He found what he expected a moment later--the bones of a human being  picked clean of all flesh by the vultures, while scattered here and there  were shreds and pieces of the garments worn by the unfortunate person.    He found enough of the clothes to know only too well that they belonged to  his lost friend Plum Plucky, and tears filled his eyes as he turned away  to shut out the sad spectacle.    \"This is fearful!\" he murmured. \"Poor, poor fellow!\"    At this very moment, though of course unknown to him, tired of waiting for  him any longer, Captain Hillgrove was sailing out of Gobija harbor,  anxious to reach the open sea before night should set in.          Chapter XXIII    Jenny        The vultures were still screaming over his head, venting their rage over  being disturbed in their feast, as Jack hastily brushed the tears from his  eyes and looked more clearly around him.    \"Poor Plum!\" he exclaimed, \"this is indeed a sad fate. It seems a certain  fatality for any one to be my friend. But I suppose you were killed for  your money. It seems only decent that I should give your bones human  burial.\"    With his knife and the stirrups taken from the trappings of his horse,  Jack hollowed out a spot to receive all that was left of the body he had  found.    By the time he had finished the sad task it was quite dark in the forest,  so he knew he must get away from the lonely place as soon as possible, if  he valued his own life.    With a last farewell look at the wildwood grave which he was never to see  again, he rode away through the wilderness.    He soon found, however, that his horse was so spent that it must have rest  before going much further.    As impatient as he was to reach Cobija, wondering what Captain Hillgrove  would think of his prolonged absence, he yielded to the unavoidable and  stopped awhile in the heart of the forest.    It was broad daylight when he rode into De la Pama on a used up horse and  himself quite fagged out.    But notwithstanding his condition, he felt obliged to push on for Cobija,  dreading lest he should find Captain Hillgrove already gone. Accordingly  remounting the pony he had previously ridden, he started for the sea coast  at a rapid gait.    The wiry little animal made a remarkable record, but he might as well have  been on the road another day, as it seemed, for he found his worst fears  realized.    Captain Hillgrove had sailed!    Whither should he turn now? What should he do? Never in his life had he  felt so lonely and so near despair as he did at that time. The indomitable  pluck which had carried him through so many trials"]]]
