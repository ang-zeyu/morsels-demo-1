This dessert is more attractive if a little pink  coloring is used in its preparation.    SPANISH CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/4 c. cold water  1 pt. milk  2 eggs  1/4 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Heat the milk in a double boiler,  add the gelatine, and cook until it is completely dissolved. Separate  the eggs, beat the yolks, and to them add the sugar and salt. Stir into  the mixture in the double boiler, and cook until the eggs have  thickened. Remove from the fire, beat the egg whites until they are  stiff, and fold them into the mixture. Add the vanilla. Pour into a mold  that has been moistened with cold water, cool, and serve. If coloring is  added, it may be put in upon removing the dessert from the stove.    [Illustration: FIG. 6, Strawberry cream fluff with ladyfingers.]    52. STRAWBERRY CREAM PUFF.--One of the most attractive desserts that can  be made of gelatine is strawberry cream fluff. It is especially  delicious in warm weather, but plenty of time must be allowed for it to  solidify. Any desired way of serving it may be followed out, but a  method that is always pleasing is illustrated in Fig. 6. The gelatine  mixture is piled into stemmed glasses and then surrounded by thin pieces  of sponge cake or ladyfingers, as here shown. A few fresh strawberries  or strawberries that have been canned in thick sirup make an attractive  garnish. If a deeper shade of pink is desired than the strawberry juice  gives, pink coloring may be added before the whipped cream is beaten  into the gelatine.    STRAWBERRY CREAM FLUFF  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/4 c. cold water  1-1/2 c. strawberry juice  Juice of one lemon  1/4 c. sugar  1-1/2 c. whipped cream    Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Heat the strawberry juice to the  boiling point, and add it to the soaked gelatine. Add the lemon juice  and sugar and place the gelatine where it will cool. When it has started  to solidify, beat into it the whipped cream and continue beating until  the mixture stands up well when dropped from a spoon. Place in a mold  and cool. Serve in any desired way.    53. PINEAPPLE CREAM FLUFF.--If pineapple is preferred to strawberries,  pineapple cream fluff may be made according to the accompanying  directions. Canned pineapple may be utilized nicely in the preparation  of this dessert. If it is in rings, it should be chopped into small  pieces, but grated pineapple needs no further preparation. Fresh  pineapple used for the purpose must be cooked before it can be used in  this dessert.    PINEAPPLE CREAM FLUFF  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/4 c. cold water  1-1/2 c. pineapple juice  1/2 c. sugar  1-1/2 c. whipped cream  1 c. grated or chopped pineapple    Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Heat the pineapple juice to the  boiling point and add it to the soaked gelatine. Add the sugar and set  aside to cool. After the gelatine has started to solidify, beat the  whipped cream and the grated pineapple into it. When solidified and  ready to use, turn out on a plate and serve with whipped cream. If  desired, the pineapple may be left out of the dessert and, instead, a  spoonful placed on the top of each serving.    54. MARSHMALLOW WHIP.--Something rather unusual in the way of a gelatine  dessert can be had by making marshmallow whip according to the  accompanying recipe.    MARSHMALLOW WHIP  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/2 oz. or 2-1/4 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1 pt. water  1 c. sugar  3 egg whites  Pink coloring  Strawberry flavoring  1/2 sq. chocolate  Vanilla    Soak the gelatine in 1/2 cupful of water. Bring 1 cupful of water to the  boiling point, dissolve the gelatine in it, and place in ice water to  cool. Put the sugar to cook with 1/2 cupful of water, and cook until the  sirup will spin a thread or until it will form a firm ball when tried in  cold water. Beat the egg whites, pour the hot sirup gradually over them,  and continue beating. Add the gelatine, which by this time should be  commencing to solidify. Divide the mixture into three equal parts. To  one add a little pink coloring and some strawberry flavoring and pour  into a mold that has been wet with cold water. To one of the remaining  parts, add the chocolate, which has been melted, mixed with a  tablespoonful or two of sugar and 2 tablespoonfuls of water, and cooked  to a smooth paste. Continue beating this until it is stiff, and then  pour it in the mold on top of the strawberry flavored whip. To the  remaining third, add the vanilla, beat until it is stiff, and pour on  top of the chocolate whip. These colors may be arranged in any desirable  way, others may be used, or the whip may be made up simply in one color  or in two. After it has become set and hardened, turn from the mold, and  serve, using whipped cream if desired.           *       *       *       *       *      FROZEN DESSERTS    PRINCIPLES OF FROZEN-DESSERT MAKING    55. NATURE OF FROZEN DESSERTS.--Frozen desserts were formerly confined  almost entirely to warm weather, but they are now used during the entire  year and served on almost any occasion. They are without doubt the  daintiest dessert that can be served and are popular with almost every  one. A very ordinary meal becomes much more attractive when a frozen  dessert is served with it, and a dainty luncheon or an elaborate dinner  seems incomplete without a dessert of this nature. In reality, it is  quite impossible to serve, in either hot or cold weather, any dessert  that is as pleasing as an ice or an ice cream of some kind.    56. In addition to being delicious and finding favor with most persons,  frozen desserts occur in unlimited variety. They include ice creams of  various kinds, frozen custards and punches, sherbets, ices, frappes,  mousses, parfaits, and biscuits. Recipes for several varieties of each  of these kinds are given in this Section, and it will therefore not be a  difficult matter to select a frozen dessert that will be suitable for  any meal in which it may be served. The preparation of frozen desserts,  however, need not be confined to a certain limited number of recipes, as  a recipe may be devised to suit almost any occasion or condition. For  instance, if there are certain fruits or fruit juices in supply that  should be used, an excellent way in which to utilize them is in a frozen  dessert of some kind. After a little experience, the housewife will find  that she can produce excellent results by merely combining the  ingredients she has on hand or those corresponding with the meal in  which the frozen dessert is to be served.    57. The food value of frozen desserts varies with the ingredients used  in their preparation, it being extremely high in some and very low in  others. Therefore, the particular one to select depends somewhat on the  other dishes in the meal. On the whole, they contain very healthful  ingredients, so that, if they are properly made, they may have a place  in the diets of both children and grown ups, sick persons and well ones.  Whether or not certain individuals should eat frozen desserts is  sometimes a troublesome question. There may be conditions under which  desserts of this kind should not be included in the diet, but these need  not give the housewife any particular concern.    58. Frozen desserts may be purchased ready made, but those made in the  home cost less, are usually more delicious, and can be prepared in  greater variety. As they are not difficult to make and are not  necessarily an expensive dessert, the housewife should often include  them in her meals. Therefore, an ice-cream freezer of a size that will  accommodate the requirements of the members of the family is a good  thing to add to the cookery equipment. Ices and ice creams can be made  in a pail that has a cover and a bail, such as a lard pail, but this is  not a very convenient equipment and does not produce such satisfactory  results as those obtained with a good freezer. Some desserts of this  kind may be frozen without the use of a freezer, but, as a rule, they  contain materials that make them rather expensive.    59. THEORY OF FREEZING.--So that the best results may be secured in the  making of frozen desserts, it is well that the theory of freezing be  thoroughly understood. The two things necessary for the freezing of such  desserts are ice and salt. When these are brought together and the ice  melts, a salt solution is formed, since salt has a tendency to combine  with moisture whenever they come in contact with each other. In order to  obtain this result in the freezing of desserts, it is necessary, of  course, that the ice be melted. The warmth required to make this melting  possible comes from the contents of the can inside the ice-cream  freezer. When this warmth is absorbed by the ice, the cold temperature  released by the melting of the ice passes into the ice-cream mixture.  The result is that the ice tends to become liquid and the contents of  the can solid by the exchange of temperatures. To make the mixture of  uniform consistency, it is usually agitated by means of a dasher during  the freezing process. This incorporates air into the mixture and  consequently makes it light and increases its volume.    60. PROPORTION OF ICE TO SALT.--The ingredients used in the mixture have  much to do with the texture of the ice cream when it is frozen. For  instance, a mixture that is thin and composed largely of water will not  have so smooth a consistency when frozen as a heavier mixture in which  cream or eggs or both are present and a smaller proportion of water is  used. Another important factor in the texture of the finished product is  the proportion of ice to salt, for this has much to do with the length  of time required for freezing the mixture.

This illustration shows, with a few  exceptions, such foods canned by the one-period cold-pack method, and  merits close inspection. As will be observed, the jars are full and well  packed and the color of each food is retained. Each can of food  indicates careful work and serves to show the housewife what she may  expect if she performs her work under the right conditions and in the  right way. This illustration likewise serves to demonstrate that any  food may be successfully canned by the one-period cold-pack method, a  claim that cannot be made for the other canning methods. In fact, some  of the foods illustrated, as, for instance, peas and corn, cannot be  canned successfully by any other method.      DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING VEGETABLES    56. CLASSIFICATION OF VEGETABLES.--To simplify the directions here given  for the canning of vegetables, this food is divided into four groups,  as follows:    1. _Greens_, which include all wild and cultivated edible greens, such  as beet greens, collards, cress, dandelion, endive, horseradish greens,  kale, mustard greens, spinach, New Zealand spinach, and Swiss chard.    2. _Pod and related vegetables_, which include asparagus, beans, both  string and wax, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, okra,  peppers, both green and ripe, summer squash, and vegetable marrow.    3. _Root and tuber vegetables_, which include beets, carrots, kohlrabi,  parsnips, rutabagas, salsify, sweet potatoes, and turnips.    4. _Special vegetables_, which include beans, both Lima and shell, corn,  mushrooms, peas, pumpkin, sauerkraut, squash, succotash and other  vegetable combinations, and tomatoes.    The convenience of this plan will be readily seen when it is understood  that, with the exception of the special vegetables, the same method of  preparation and the time given for the various steps in the canning  process apply to all vegetables of the same class. Thus, if directions  for a vegetable belonging to a certain class are not definitely stated  in the text, it may be taken for granted that this vegetable may be  canned in the manner given for another vegetable of the same class.    57. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.--The canning of vegetables may be most  successfully done by the one-period cold-pack method. Tomatoes,  however, because of the large quantity of acid they contain, may be  canned and kept with little difficulty by the open-kettle method, but  they will be found to keep their shape better if the cold-pack method  is employed.    The time required for cooking any vegetable after it is packed in jars  depends on the kind and the age. Therefore, if a vegetable is hard or  likely to be tough, it may be necessary to increase the time given in  the directions; whereas, if it is young and tender or very ripe, as in  the case of tomatoes, the time for cooking may perhaps have to be  decreased. Because, in altitudes higher than sea level, the boiling  point of water is lower than 212 degrees Fahrenheit, the length of time  for boiling foods in the water bath must be increased after an altitude  of 500 feet is reached. Therefore, for every additional 500 feet over  the first 500 feet, 10 per cent. should be added to the time given for  the boiling in water. In case a pressure cooker is used, however, this  is not necessary.    The canning directions here given are for 1-quart jars. If pint jars are  to be used, decrease the salt proportionately; also, decrease the time  for cooking in each case one-fifth of the time, or 20 per cent. If  2-quart jars are to be used, double the amount of salt and add to the  length of time for cooking one-fifth, or 20 per cent. For instance, if a  1-quart jar of food requires 90 minutes, a pint jar of the same food  would require 72 minutes and a 2-quart jar, 108 minutes.      GROUP 1--GREENS    58. In canning greens, or vegetables belonging to the first group,  select those which are fresh and tender. Greens that are old and  inclined to be strong and tough may require longer blanching and  cooking. Look the greens over carefully, rejecting all leaves that are  wilted or otherwise spoiled. Cut off the roots and drop the leaves into  a pan of cold water. Wash these thoroughly a number of times, using  fresh water each time, in order to remove all sand and dirt that may be  clinging to them. Then proceed to blanch them for 10 to 15 minutes in  steam, suspending the greens over boiling water in a piece of  cheesecloth, a colander, or the top of a steamer. After blanching, dip  them quickly into cold water. Then pack the greens tightly into jars and  add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful. No water has to be added to  greens, because the leaves themselves contain sufficient water. When the  jars are thus packed, adjust the covers and proceed to sterilize and  cook the greens according to the directions previously given. If the  water bath is to be used, boil them in it for 1-1/2 to 2 hours; but if  the pressure cooker is to be employed for this purpose, cook them at a  5-pound pressure for 60 minutes or at a 10-pound pressure for  40 minutes.      GROUP 2--POD AND RELATED VEGETABLES    59. The best results in canning vegetables belonging to the second group  will be derived when those which are fresh and tender are selected. As  has been mentioned, the sooner vegetables are canned after they are  taken from the garden, the better will be the canned product. Directions  for practically all vegetables included in this group are here given.    60. ASPARAGUS.--Select tender asparagus, and proceed with the canning no  later than 5 hours after it has been taken from the garden. Remove the  hard portions at the ends of the stems, and cut the trimmed stems into  pieces the length of the jars into which they are to be placed. If  preferred, however, the asparagus may be cut into small pieces. Wash the  cut asparagus thoroughly in cold water, and then sort out the uneven  pieces that were cut off in making the stems even in length. These may  be canned separately for soup. Lay the stems of asparagus in an orderly  pile in a colander or a wire basket, cover it, and place it into a large  vessel where it may be kept completely covered with boiling water for 5  minutes. Then cold-dip the asparagus quickly, and pack it neatly into  the jars, keeping the tip ends up. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each  jarful and pour boiling water into each jar until it is completely full.  Adjust the covers and proceed to sterilize and cook the jars of food.  Cook for 1-1/2 to 2 hours in the water bath, or, in the pressure cooker,  cook for 60 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 40 minutes at a  pressure of 10 pounds.    61. BRUSSELS SPROUTS, CABBAGE, AND CAULIFLOWER.--In canning Brussels  sprouts, cabbage, or cauliflower, first prepare each vegetable as if it  were to be cooked for the table. When thus made ready, blanch it with  the aid of a square of cheesecloth or a colander in live steam, over  boiling water, for 10 to 15 minutes. Then cold-dip it and pack it  tightly into the jars. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful and fill  each jar with boiling water. Proceed next to sterilize and cook it  according to the method selected. Boil for 90 minutes in the water bath;  in the pressure cooker, cook for 60 minutes at a 5-pound pressure or for  40 minutes at a 10-pound pressure.    62. EGGPLANT AND SUMMER SQUASH.--Both eggplant and summer squash are  canned in the same way, because the consistency of these vegetables is  much alike. Select firm vegetables with no decayed spots. Blanch for 3  to 8 minutes in boiling water; cold-dip quickly; remove the skins; cut  into pieces of a size that will fit into the jars; pack into the jars;  and add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful. Next, adjust the jar lids  and proceed according to the directions given for the method selected.  In the water bath, boil for 1-1/2 hours; in the pressure cooker, cook  for 60 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 40 minutes at a pressure  of 10 pounds. Eggplant or summer squash so canned may be rolled in egg  and crumbs and sauted or fried, the same as fresh vegetables of  this kind.    63. OKRA AND GREEN PEPPERS.--Both okra and green peppers may also be  canned in the same way. Prepare these vegetables for canning by washing  fresh, tender pods of either vegetable thoroughly. Blanch for 5 to 15  minutes in boiling water and cold-dip quickly. Pack the pods into the  jars, add a teaspoonful of salt to each jarful, and fill the jars with  boiling water. Adjust the lids and proceed according to directions for  the method selected. In the water bath, boil for 1-1/2 to 2 hours; in  the pressure cooker, cook for 60 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or  for 40 minutes at a pressure of 10 pounds.    64. STRING BEANS.--String beans of any variety should be canned as soon  as they are gathered. If the beans to be canned are not of the  stringless variety, prepare them by stringing them, following the  directions given in _Vegetables_, Part 1. Stringless beans should be  selected if possible, to avoid this part of the work. Cut out any rusted  portions, cut each end from the beans, and, if preferred, cut the beans  into inch lengths. When thus prepared, blanch them for 10 to 15 minutes  in live steam, cold-dip quickly, and pack tightly into the jars. Add a  teaspoonful of salt to each jarful, fill the jars with boiling water,  adjust the lids, and cook according to the method preferred. In the  water bath, boil for 1-1/2 to 2 hours; in the pressure cooker, cook for  60 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 40 minutes at a pressure of  10 pounds.      GROUP 3--ROOT AND TUBER VEGETABLES    65. Only the small, young, and tender vegetables included in the third  group lend themselves readily to canning. As a rule, such vegetables are  allowed to mature, when they can be stored for winter use without  canning them. However, many housewives like to can some of them for the"]]]
