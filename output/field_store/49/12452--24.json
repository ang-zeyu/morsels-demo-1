We can discuss it orally some time; now I only want to tell  you how it happened. I had repeatedly been disgusted by V.'s rudeness  to the government and ourselves, and was prepared resolutely to oppose  him at the next opportunity that offered. He accused me of want of  diplomatic discretion, and said that hitherto the \"burning cigar\" was  my only known achievement. He alluded to an occurrence at the Palace  of the Diet, of which I had previously told him confidentially, at his  particular request, as of something quite unimportant, but comical. I  then retorted from the platform that his remark overstepped not only  the bounds of diplomatic but also of ordinary discretion, which one  had a right to demand from every man of education. Next day he  challenged me, through Herr von Sauken-Julienfelde, for four  pistol-shots; I accepted it after Oscar Arnim's proposal, that we  should fight with swords, had been declined by Sauken. Vincke wished  to defer the matter for forty-eight hours, which I granted. On the  25th, at 8 A.M., we rode to Tegel; to a charming spot in the woods by  the seashore; it was beautiful weather, and the birds sang so gayly in  the sunshine that, as soon as we entered the wood, all sad thoughts  left me; only the thought of Johanna I had to drive from me by force,  so as not to be affected by it. With me as witnesses were Arnim and  Eberhard Stolberg, and my brother as very dejected spectator. With V.  were Sauken, and Major Vincke of the First Chamber, as well as a  Bodelschwingh (nephew of the Minister and of Vincke), as impartial  witness. The latter declared before the matter began that the  challenge seemed to him to be, under the circumstances, too stringent,  and proposed that it should be modified to one shot apiece. Sauken, in  V.'s name, was agreeable to this, and had word brought to me that the  whole thing should be called off if I declared I was sorry for my  remark. As I could not truthfully do this, we took our positions,  fired at Bodelschwingh's command, and both missed. God forgive the  grave sin that I did not at once recognize His mercy, but I cannot  deny it: when I looked through the smoke and saw my adversary standing  erect, a feeling of disappointment prevented me from participating in  the general rejoicing, which caused Bodelschwingh to shed tears; the  modification of the challenge annoyed me, and I would gladly have  continued the combat. But, as I was not the insulted party, I could  say nothing; it was over, and all shook hands. We rode home and I ate  with my sister alone. All the world was dissatisfied with the outcome,  but the Lord must know what He still intends to make of V. In cool  blood, I am certainly very grateful that it happened so. What probably  contributed much to it was the fact that a couple of very good  pistols, which were originally intended to be used, were so loaded  that for the moment they were quite useless, and we had to take those  intended for the seconds, with which it was difficult to hit. An  official disturbance has interrupted me, and now I must close--time is  up. Only I still want to say that I had consulted beforehand, about  the duel, with old Stolberg, General Gerlach, Minister Uhden and Hans;  they were all of opinion that it must be; Buechsel, too, saw no  alternative, although he admonished me to desist. I spent an hour in  prayer, with him and Stolberg, the evening before. I never doubted  that I should have to appear, but I did doubt whether I should shoot  at V. I did it without anger, and missed. Now farewell, my dearly  beloved mother. Give love to father and every one from    Your faithful son, v.B.      Vienna, June 14, '52.    _My Beloved Heart_,--At this hour I ought to sit down and write  a long report to his Majesty concerning a lengthy and fruitless  negotiation which I had today with Count Buol, and concerning an  audience with the Archduchess Empress-Dowager. But I have just taken  a promenade on the high ramparts all round the inner city, and from  them seen a charming sunset behind the Leopoldsberg, and now I am much  more inclined to think of you than of business. I stood for a long  time on the red Thor Tower, which commands a view of the Jaegerzeil  and of our old-time domicile, the Lamb, with the cafe before it; at  the Archduchess' I was in a room which opens on the homelike little  garden into which we once secretly and thoughtlessly found our way;  yesterday I heard _Lucia_--Italian, very good; all this so stirs  my longing for you that I am quite sad and incapable. For it is terrible  to be thus alone in the world, when one is no longer accustomed to it; I  am in quite a Lynaric mood. Nothing but calls, and coming to know  strangers, with whom I am always having the same talk. Every one knows  that I have not yet been here very long, but whether I was ever here  before; that is the great question which I have answered two hundred  times in these days, and happy that that topic still remains. For folk  bent on pleasure this may be a very pretty place, for it offers whatever  is capable of affording outward diversion to people. But I am longing  for Frankfort as if it were Kniephof, and do not wish to come here by  any means. F. must lie just where the sun went down, over the  Mannhartsberg yonder; and, while it was sinking here, it still continued  shining with you for over half an hour. It is terribly far. How  different it was with you here my heart, and with Salzburg and Meran in  prospect; I have grown terribly old since then. * * * It is very cruel  that we must spend such a long period of our brief life apart; that time  is lost, then, and cannot be brought back. God alone knows why He allows  others to remain together who are quite at their ease when apart; like  an aged friend of mine, who travelled with me as far as Dresden had to  sit in the same compartment with his wife all the time, and could not  smoke; and we must always correspond at a great distance. We shall make  up for it all, and love each other a great deal more when we are again  together; if only we keep well! Then I shall not murmur. Today I had the  great pleasure of receiving, _via_ Berlin, your letter of last Thursday;  that is the second one since I left Frankfort; surely none is lost? I  was very happy and thankful that all of you are well. * * * As soon as I  find myself once more on the old, tiresome Thuringian railroad I shall  be out of myself, and still more so when I catch a glimpse of our light  from Bockenheim; I must travel about nine hundred miles thither, not  including two hundred and fifty miles from Pesth back to this place. How  gladly I shall undertake them, once I am seated in the train! I shall  probably abandon my trip by way of Munich; from this place to M. is a  post-trip of fifty hours; by water still longer; and I shall have to  render a verbal report in Berlin, anyway. About politics I can,  fortunately, write nothing; for, even if the English courier who takes  this to Berlin is a safeguard against our post-office, the Taxis  scoundrels will, nevertheless, get hold of it.    Be sure to write me detailed information as to your personal  condition. Greet mother, our relations, if they are still there,  Leontine, the children, Stolberg, Wentzel, and all the rest. Farewell  my angel. God preserve you.    Your most faithful v.B.      Ofen, June 23, '52.    _My Darling_,--I have just left the steamer, and do not know how  better to utilize the moment at my disposal until Hildebrand follows  with my things than by sending you a love-token from this far-easterly  but pretty spot. The Emperor has graciously assigned me quarters in  his palace, and I am sitting here in a large vaulted chamber at the  open window, into which the evening bells of Pesth are pealing. The  view outward is charming. The castle stands high; immediately below me  the Danube, spanned by the suspension-bridge; behind it Pesth, which  would remind you of Dantzig, and farther away the endless plain  extending far beyond Pesth, disappearing in the bluish-red dusk of  evening. To the left of Pesth I look up the Danube, far, very far,  away; to my left, _i.e._, on the right-hand shore, it is fringed first  by the city of Ofen, behind it hills like the Berici near Venetia blue  and bluer, then bluish-red in the evening sky, which glows behind. In  the midst of both cities is the large sheet of water as at Linz,  intersected by the suspension-bridge and a wooded island. It is really  splendid; only you, my angel, are lacking for me to enjoy this  prospect _with you_; then it would be _quite_ nice. Then, too, the  road hither, at least from Gran to Pesth, would have pleased you.  Imagine Odenwald and Taunus moved close together, the waters of the  Danube filling the interval; and occasionally, particularly near  Wisserad, a little Duerrenstein-Agstein. The shady side of the trip was  the sunny side; it burned as if they wanted tokay to grow on the  steamer, and the crowd of travelers was large; but, just imagine, not  one Englishman; it must be that they have not yet discovered Hungary.  For the rest, there were queer fellows enough, dirty and washed, of  all Oriental and Occidental nations. * * * By this time I am becoming  impatient as to Hildebrand's whereabouts; I am lying in the window,  half musing in the moonlight, half waiting for him as for a mistress,  for I long for a clean shirt. * * * If you were here for only a  moment, and could contemplate now the dull, silvery Danube, the dark  hills on a pale-red background, and the lights which are shining up  from Pesth below, Vienna would lose much in your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#19)"],[1,"took a motor cab  to Neuilly.    He went along the Avenue de Madrid on foot and turned down the Boulevard  Richard-Wallace, opposite the Bois de Boulogne. Mazeroux was waiting for  him in front of a small three-storied house standing at the back of a  courtyard contained within the very high walls of the adjoining property.    \"Is this number eight?\"    \"Yes, Chief, but tell me how--\"    \"One moment, old chap; give me time to recover my breath.\"    He gave two or three great gasps.    \"Lord, how good it is to be up and doing!\" he said. \"Upon my word, I was  getting rusty. And what a pleasure to pursue those scoundrels! So you  want me to tell you?\"    He passed his arm through the sergeant's.    \"Listen, Alexandre, and profit by my words. Remember this: when a person  is choosing initials for his address at a _poste restante_ he doesn't  pick them at random, but always in such a way that the letters convey a  meaning to the person corresponding with him, a meaning which will enable  that other person easily to remember the address.\"    \"And in this case?\"    \"In this case, Mazeroux, a man like myself, who knows Neuilly and the  neighbourhood of the Bois, is at once struck by those three letters,  'B.R.W.,' and especially by the 'W.', a foreign letter, an English letter.  So that in my mind's eye, instantly, as in a flash, I saw the three  letters in their logical place as initials at the head of the words for  which they stand. I saw the 'B' of 'boulevard,' and the 'R' and the  English 'W' of Richard-Wallace. And so I came to the Boulevard  Richard-Wallace, And that, my dear sir, explains the milk in the  cocoanut.\"    Mazeroux seemed a little doubtful.    \"And what do you think, Chief?\"    \"I think nothing. I am looking about. I am building up a theory on the  first basis that offers a probable theory. And I say to myself ... I say  to myself ... I say to myself, Mazeroux, that this is a devilish  mysterious little hole and that this house--Hush! Listen--\"    He pushed Mazeroux into a dark corner. They had heard a noise, the  slamming of a door.    Footsteps crossed the courtyard in front of the house. The lock of the  outer gate grated. Some one appeared, and the light of a street lamp fell  full on his face.    \"Dash it all,\" muttered Mazeroux, \"it's he!\"    \"I believe you're right.\"    \"It's he. Chief. Look at the black stick and the bright handle. And did  you see the eyeglasses--and the beard? What a oner you are, Chief!\"    \"Calm yourself and let's go after him.\"    The man had crossed the Boulevard Richard-Wallace and was turning into  the Boulevard Maillot. He was walking pretty fast, with his head up,  gayly twirling his stick. He lit a cigarette.    At the end of the Boulevard Maillot, the man passed the octroi and  entered Paris. The railway station of the outer circle was close by. He  went to it and, still followed by the others, stepped into a train that  took them to Auteuil.    \"That's funny,\" said Mazeroux. \"He's doing exactly what he did a  fortnight ago. This is where he was seen.\"    The man now went along the fortifications. In a quarter of an hour he  reached the Boulevard Suchet and almost immediately afterward the house  in which M. Fauville and his son had been murdered.    He climbed the fortifications opposite the house and stayed there for  some minutes, motionless, with his face to the front of the house. Then  continuing his road he went to La Muette and plunged into the dusk of the  Bois de Boulogne.    \"To work and boldly!\" said Don Luis, quickening his pace.    Mazeroux stopped him.    \"What do you mean, Chief?\"    \"Well, catch him by the throat! There are two of us; we couldn't hope for  a better moment.\"    \"What! Why, it's impossible!\"    \"Impossible? Are you afraid? Very well, I'll do it by myself.\"    \"Look here, Chief, you're not serious!\"    \"Why shouldn't I be serious?\"    \"Because one can't arrest a man without a reason.\"    \"Without a reason? A scoundrel like this? A murderer? What more do  you want?\"    \"In the absence of compulsion, of catching him in the act, I want  something that I haven't got.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"A warrant. I haven't a warrant.\"    Mazeroux's accent was so full of conviction, and the answer struck Don  Luis Perenna as so comical, that he burst out laughing.    \"You have no warrant? Poor little chap! Well, I'll soon show you if I  need a warrant!\"    \"You'll show me nothing,\" cried Mazeroux, hanging on to his companion's  arm. \"You shan't touch the man.\"    \"One would think he was your mother!\"    \"Come, Chief.\"    \"But, you stick-in-the-mud of an honest man,\" shouted Don Luis, angrily,  \"if we let this opportunity slip shall we ever find another?\"    \"Easily. He's going home. I'll inform the commissary of police. He will  telephone to headquarters; and to-morrow morning--\"    \"And suppose the bird has flown?\"    \"I have no warrant.\"    \"Do you want me to sign you one, idiot?\"    But Don Luis mastered his rage. He felt that all his arguments would be  shattered to pieces against the sergeant's obstinacy, and that, if  necessary, Mazeroux would go to the length of defending the enemy against  him. He simply said in a sententious tone:    \"One ass and you make a pair of asses; and there are as many asses as  there are people who try to do police work with bits of paper,  signatures, warrants, and other gammon. Police work, my lad, is done with  one's fists. When you come upon the enemy, hit him. Otherwise, you stand  a chance of hitting the air. With that, good-night. I'm going to bed.  Telephone to me when the job is done.\"    He went home, furious, sick of an adventure in which he had not had elbow  room, and in which he had had to submit to the will, or, rather, to the  weakness of others.    But next morning when he woke up his longing to see the police lay hold  of the man with the ebony stick, and especially the feeling that his  assistance would be of use, impelled him to dress as quickly as he could.    \"If I don't come to the rescue,\" he thought, \"they'll let themselves be  done in the eye. They're not equal to a contest of this kind.\"    Just then Mazeroux rang up and asked to speak to him. He rushed to a  little telephone box which his predecessor had fitted up on the first  floor, in a dark recess that communicated only with his study, and  switched on the electric light.    \"Is that you, Alexandre?\"    \"Yes, Chief. I'm speaking from a wine shop near the house on the  Boulevard Richard-Wallace.\"    \"What about our man?\"    \"The bird's still in the nest. But we're only just in time.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Yes, he's packed his trunk. He's going away this morning.\"    \"How do they know?\"    \"Through the woman who manages for him. She's just come to the house and  will let us in.\"    \"Does he live alone?\"    \"Yes, the woman cooks his meals and goes away in the evening. No one ever  calls except a veiled lady who has paid him three visits since he's been  here. The housekeeper was not able to see what she was like. As for him,  she says he's a scholar, who spends his time reading and working.\"    \"And have you a warrant?\"    \"Yes, we're going to use it.\"    \"I'll come at once.\"    \"You can't! We've got Weber at our head. Oh, by the way, have you heard  the news about Mme. Fauville?\"    \"About Mme. Fauville?\"    \"Yes, she tried to commit suicide last night.\"    \"What! Tried to commit suicide!\"    Perenna had uttered an exclamation of astonishment and was very much  surprised to hear, almost at the same time, another cry, like an echo, at  his elbow. Without letting go the receiver, he turned round and saw that  Mlle. Levasseur was in the study a few yards away from him, standing with  a distorted and livid face. Their eyes met. He was on the point of  speaking to her, but she moved away, without leaving the room, however.    \"What the devil was she listening for?\" Don Luis wondered. \"And why that  look of dismay?\"    Meanwhile, Mazeroux continued:    \"She said, you know, that she would try to kill herself. But it must have  taken a goodish amount of pluck.\"    \"But how did she do it?\" Perenna asked.    \"I'll tell you another time. They're calling me. Whatever you do, Chief,  don't come.\"    \"Yes,\" he replied, firmly, \"I'm coming. After all, the least I can do is  to be in at the death, seeing that it was I who found the scent. But  don't be afraid. I shall keep in the background.\"    \"Then hurry, Chief. We're delivering the attack in ten minutes.\"    \"I'll be with you before that.\"    He quickly hung up the receiver and turned on his heel to leave the  telephone box. The next moment he had flung himself against the farther  wall. Just as he was about to pass out he had heard something click  above his head and he but barely had the time to leap back and escape  being struck by an iron curtain which fell in front of him with a  terrible thud.    Another second and the huge mass would have crushed him. He could feel it  whizzing by his head. And he had never before experienced the anguish of  danger so intensely.    After a moment of genuine fright, in which he stood as though petrified,  with his brain in a whirl, he recovered his coolness and threw himself  upon the obstacle. But it at once appeared to him that the obstacle was  unsurmountable.    It was a heavy metal panel, not made of plates or lathes fastened one to  the other, but formed of a solid slab, massive, firm, and strong, and  covered with the sheen of time darkened here and there with patches of  rust. On either side and at the top and bottom the edges of the panel  fitted in a narrow groove which covered them hermetically.    He was a prisoner. In a sudden fit of rage he banged at the metal with  his fists. He remembered that Mlle. Levasseur was in the study. If she  had not yet left the room--and surely she could not have left it when the  thing happened--she would hear the noise. She was bound to hear it. She  would be sure to come back, give the alarm, and rescue him."]]]
