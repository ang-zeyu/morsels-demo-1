Menahem himself, indeed, was so barbarous that the more  moderate leader Eleazar turned against him and put him to death. But  Josephus sees in the massacre of the Roman garrison the pollution of the  city, which doomed it to destruction. In his belligerent ethics,  massacre of the Romans by the Jews is always a crime against God,  requiring His visitation; massacres of the Jews are a visitation of God,  revealing that the Romans were His chosen instrument.    With the history of the war, so far as the historian was involved in it,  we have already dealt. We are here concerned with the character and the  reliability of his account. Josephus is somewhat vague and confused  about the dispositions of the Jewish leaders, but when he is not  justifying his own treachery, or venting his spite on his rivals, he  shows many of the parts of a military historian. He surveys with  clearness and conciseness the nature of the country that the Romans had  to conquer, and he describes the Roman armies and Roman camp with  greater detail than any Roman historian, his design being \"not so much  to praise the Romans as to comfort those who have been conquered and to  deter others from rising.\"[1] It has, however, been pointed out with  great force, in support of the theory that he is following closely and  almost paraphrasing a Roman authority on the war, that his geographical  and topographical lore is introduced not in its natural place, but on  the occasions when Vespasian is the actor in a particular district.[2]  Thus, he describes the Phoenician coast when Vespasian arrives at  Ptolemais, Galilee when Vespasian is besieging Tarichea, Jericho when  Vespasian makes his sally to the Jordan cities.[3]    [Footnote 1: B.J. III. v. This remark must clearly have appeared in the  original Aramaic.]    [Footnote 2: Schlatter, Zur Topographie und Geschichte Palastinas, pp.  99 _ff_.]    [Footnote 3: B.J. III. iii. 1 and x. 7.]    All this would be natural in a chronicler who was one of Vespasian's  staff, but it is odd in the Jewish commander of Galilee. Again, he makes  certain confusions about Hebrew names of places, which are easily  explained in a Roman, but are inexplicable in the learned priest he  represents himself to be. He says the town of Gamala was so called  because of its supposed resemblance to a camel (in Greek, Kamelos), and  the Jews corrupted the name.[1] A Roman writer no doubt would have  regarded the Hebrew [Hebrew: Namal] as a corruption of the Greek word: a  Jew should have known better.    [Footnote 1: B.J. III. iv. 2.]    Again, he explains Bezetha, the name of the northeastern quarter of  Jerusalem, as meaning the new house or city,[1] a mistake natural to a  Roman who was aware that it was in fact the new part of the city, and  alternatively called by the Greek name [Greek: kainopolis], but an  extraordinary blunder for a Jew, who would surely know that it meant the  House of Olives, while the Aramaic or popular name for \"new city\" would  be Bet-Hadta. He does not once refer to Mount Zion, but knows the hill  by its Greek name of Acra. Yet again it is significant that he inserts  in his geography pagan touches that are part of the common stock of  Greco-Roman notices of Palestine. At Joppa, he says, one may still see  on the rock the trace of the chains of Andromeda,[2] who in Hellenistic  legend was said to have been rescued there by the fictitious hero  Perseus. Describing the Dead Sea,[3] he mentions the destruction of the  cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a myth, as a Greek or a Roman would have  done.[4] His very accuracy about some topographical details is  suspicious. Colonel Conder[5] points with surprise to the fact that his  description of the fortress of Masada overlooking the Dead Sea, the  siege of which he had not seen, is absolutely correct, while his account  of Jotapata, which he defended, is full of exaggeration. The probable  explanation is that in the one place he copied a skilled observer; in  the other, he trusted to his own inaccurate memory. We may infer that as  in the _Antiquities_ he mainly compiled the work of predecessors that  are known, so in the _Wars_ he compiled the works of predecessors that  are unknown, adding something from his personal experience and his  national pride.    [Footnote 1: B.J. V. v. 8.]    [Footnote 2: B.J. IV. ix. 3. Pliny says the same thing in Latin.]    [Footnote 3: B.J. IV. viii. 4.]    [Footnote 4: Tac. Hist. v. 7.]    [Footnote 5: Tent Work in Palestine, 1. 207.]    Apart from his dependence on others' work, his chronicle of the war is  marred by the need of justifying his own submission, his Roman  standpoint, and his ulterior purpose of pleasing and flattering his  patrons. Vespasian and Titus are the righteous ministers of God's wrath  against His people, His vicars on earth, and every action in their  ruthless process of extermination has to be represented as a just  retribution required to expiate the sin of Jewish resistance. Titus  especially is singled out for his unfailing deeds of bravery; and when  anything is amiss with the proceedings of the Romans, the Imperial  family is always exculpated. Characteristic is the palliation of  Vespasian's brutal treatment of the people of Tarichea. When they  surrendered, they were promised their lives, but twelve hundred old men  were butchered, and over three thousand men and women were sold as  slaves. Josephus cannot find the execution of the divine will in this,  and so he is driven to explain that Vespasian was overborne by his  council, and gave them an ambiguous liberty to do as seemed good to  them.    It is the pivot of the story of the wars, as has been stated, that the  internal strife of the Jews brought about the ruin of the nation, and  the testimony of Josephus has perpetuated that conception of the last  days of Jerusalem. Our other records of the struggle go to suggest that  civil strife did take place. Tacitus[1] states that there were three  leaders, each with his own army in the city, and the Rabbinical  authorities[2] speak of the three councils in Jerusalem. It is further  said that the second Temple was destroyed because of the unprovoked  hatred among the Jews, which was the equal of the sins of murder,  unchastity, and idolatry that brought about the fall of the first  Temple.[3] Yet the fact that the men who were the foremost agitators of  the Rebellion were its leaders to the end suggests that the people had  reliance on their leadership; and Josephus probably traded largely on  his prejudices for the particulars of the civil conflicts, and he placed  all the blame on the party that was least guilty. Adopting the Roman  standpoint, he denounced the whole Zealot policy, and for John of  Gischala, their leader, he entertained a special loathing. It is  therefore his purpose to show that all the sedition was of John's  making, while it would seem more probable that the disturbances arose  because the Romanizing aristocrats were planning surrender.    [Footnote 1: Hist. v. 12.]    [Footnote 2: Midr. Kohelet, vii. 11.]    [Footnote 3: Yoma, 9b.]    According to Josephus, the Zealots, who were masters of the greater part  of Jerusalem during the struggle, established a reign of terror. They  trampled upon the laws of man, and laughed at the laws of God. They  ridiculed the oracles of the prophets as the tricks of jugglers. \"Yet  did they occasion the fulfilment of prophecies relating to their  country. For there was an ancient oracle that the city should be taken  and the sanctuary burnt when sedition should affect the Jews.\" Josephus  shares the pagan outlook of the Roman historian Tacitus, who is  horrified at the Jewish disregard of the omens and portents which  betokened the fall of their city, and speaks of them as a people prone  to superstition (what we would call faith) and deaf to divine warnings  (what we would call superstition).[1] Josephus and his friends were  looking for signs and prophecies of the ruin of the people as an excuse  for surrender; the Zealots, men of sterner stuff and of fuller faith,  were resolved to resist to the end, and would brook no parleying with  the enemy. They were in fact political nationalists of a different  school and leaning from the aristocrats and the priests. The latter  regarded political life and the Temple service as vital parts of the  national life, and believing that the legions were invincible were  anxious to keep peace with Rome. The Zealots regarded personal liberty  and national independence as vital, and, to vindicate them, fought to  the end with Rome. Both the extreme political parties lacked the  spiritual standpoint of the Pharisees, who believed that the Torah even  without political independence would hold the people together till a  better time was granted by Providence. The party conflicts induced  violence and civil tumult, and Josephus would have us believe that  \"demoniac discord\" was the main cause of the ruin of Jerusalem. During  the respite which the Jews enjoyed before the final siege of Jerusalem,  he alleges that a bitter feud was waged incessantly between Eleazar the  son of Simon, who held the Inner Court of the Temple, Simon, the son of  Gioras, who held the Upper and the greater part of the Lower city, and  John of Gischala, who occupied the outer part of the Temple. He  describes the situation rhetorically as \"sedition begetting sedition,  like a wild beast gone mad, which, for want of other food, falls to  eating its own flesh.\" And he bursts into an apostrophe over the  fighting that went on within the Temple precincts:    \"Most wretched city! What misery so great as this didst thou suffer from  the Romans, when they came to purify thee from thy internecine hatred!  Thou couldst no longer be a fit habitation for God, nor couldst thou  continue longer in being, after thou "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#18)"],[1,"to them by  their men, and could be taken away as a punishment, or be pawned or  sold in case of need; but in old days Egyptian women had all their most  beautiful possessions buried with them.    When her sister had finished I urged the other twin to speak, and  timidly Miss Elaine repeated to us what a friend of hers, a clergyman  (here a blush) had told her. That the Red Sea was not red but a  brighter blue than any sea in the world, and called red only because it  washed the Red Lands. Her friend had written down for her in verse  _such_ a sweet legend about the Nile rising every spring from a single  tear shed by Isis, a _much_ more powerful goddess than Hathor, because  she was the goddess of goodness as well as love. And the Nile used to  be named Sihor by the Egyptians; and the year separated into three  seasons, Flood time, Seed time, and Harvest. Miss Biddell's friend was  writing a book about Egypt and was going to divide it in three parts  like that. It was to be dedicated to _her_.    Bless the dear creatures, how they kept the ball rolling to please  themselves, and--indirectly--to sort out my stock of ideas!    Harry Snell, the newspaper man, was not hard to persuade to his feet.  He was studying the resemblance between Arabic and English words. He  had found out, among other things, that Tallyho was \"Tallyhoon,\"  brought home by the Crusaders. He even had a theory that some of our  words came from the early Egyptian. \"Amen,\" for instance, he believed  to be derived from \"Amon,\" the name of the great god, father of all the  other gods of Egypt, which was cried aloud, he understood, in the  temples, during religious services. The parson jumped eagerly up to  dispute this theory, and happily forgetful of me, seized the  opportunity to spring upon us a few facts from his own store. When,  however, Mr. Watts' discourse got him as far as Joseph's Well in the  Citadel, General Harlow could bear no more, but sprang up to inform us  that the Joseph of the Well in the Citadel was quite another Joseph,  some Yusef of the Arab conquerors. The general knew all about that,  because his son was stationed in the Citadel. And he proceeded to  meander on historically, over a period between the first Arab conqueror  Amru, to Haroun-al-Raschid, assuring us that old Cairo was the city of  the Arabian Nights. He would, to my joy, have gone on indefinitely from  Saladin to Napoleon if Sir John Biddell, as the only baronet on board,  had not cut the only general short. He is a square man whose portrait  could be properly done only by a Cubist. \"Too much history, my friend!\"  he shouted, getting up with the manner of one accustomed to making  dinner-table speeches. \"What most of us are coming to Egypt for is  _mummies_. Egyptian history is too troublesome, anyhow, for a normal  man to grasp. Give me mummies! There's something _in_ them. Why, even  if you get a king or queen fixed in your head, somebody who's paid to  make you know things you don't know\" (an eye-shot for Corkran) \"comes  along and swears they didn't exist. Now, there's Mena. I'd pinned him  like a stuck butterfly. I could remember that he was the first known  king, and founded Memphis and lived six thousand years before Christ,  all because we're going to stay at Mena House, which is named after  him. I don't know why I remembered him that way, but I did. Just as I  could recall the queen with a name like a sneeze by thinking of her as  Queen Hat-and-Shoes. Now Colonel Corkran informs us that we must  pronounce her, in a different way. And what's the consequence to me?  I've ceased to try and keep track of her. King Mena, too, is lost to me  forever, through the over-conscientiousness of our late conductor, who  says there never was a Mena, only several kings they've mixed into one.  I seem to be the one who's most mixed up! To whet my appetite for Egypt  now, I have to have something tasty. Where's the good of stuffing my  mind with a string of names which I couldn't mention to any one at  home, because I can't pronounce them? The word Dynasty (he pronounced  it Die-nasty) makes me sick! Luckily I feel that nobody else will know  any more than I do. I'm coming to Egypt for a rest-cure, because I  don't have to learn its history. But some lecturers won't let me have a  minute's peace. A king named Sneferu couldn't expect to appeal to a man  like me, even if he did build the oldest Pyramid, and even if you could  show me his mummy, which you can't. But I draw the line at kings  without mummies. I don't want to know them. Now, my wife is against  mummies on show. She's heard that the malignance of mummies, especially  in museums, is incredible. And she thinks it a judgment that some of  the most distinguished ones are going bad. She says it's spite. I say  its management. But I'm not ready to sit down yet! My wife means to  start a society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Mummies, with the  object of sending them back to their tombs where they can rest in that  state of death it pleased their gods to call them to. Their object was  eternal privacy, and they spent more on their tombs than their houses,  because they expected to be dead a long tune, and wanted all the  comforts of home. But I judge mummies by myself. It wouldn't have taken  me these thousands of years to realize how narrow and un-christian my  notions had been. I should see that I owed some duty to the world; and  as so much posterity had rolled by since my day, I'd feel that lying in  a museum at some large place like Cairo, was, after all, the only way  to keep my name before the public. Now, that brings me to my tip for  Lord Ernest. He asks what there is we don't know, and want to know.  I'll answer for us all, being used to feel the pulse of crowds. We want  to know what the deuce Ancient Egyptians really believed about death  and religion. Had they any sense, or were they just plain fools?\"    On the tide of applause which congratulated the boat's only baronet, I  rose. I felt that I was on the crest of the wave; for the ancient  religion of Egypt appeals to me; and as I now had reason to hope that  others were comfortably ignorant of my subject I could spread myself as  much as I pleased.    \"The Ancient Egyptians were far from being fools,\" I answered Sir John  with the air of being in their confidence. \"We who are tempted to think  so, don't take the trouble to try the key of their Faith in its door. I  might say that its door was the door of the Tomb. If we go through that  door into the Kingdom of Osiris, Amenti, which the Greeks renamed  Hades, the mysteries which appear tangled sort themselves graciously  out. The story of Isis the Great Enchantress, and her search for the  body of her husband Osiris, murdered by Set, his wicked and jealous  brother, Spirit of Evil, is perhaps the most lovable legend of the  world. But in hearing that Horus, the son of Isis, was really the same  god as Osiris, modern ideas begin to get mixed, and confuse themselves  over Isis, goddess of love and goodness, cow-headed Hathor, mistress of  love and joy, cat-headed Pasht and lioness-headed Sekhet, goddesses of  love and passion. There's hawk-headed Horus, the youth, too; and Horus  the child, represented in statues with his thumb in his mouth. How is  one to make sense of them all? But once you have the key, it is easy  and even beautiful. The esoteric or secret religion known to the high  priests and the instructed ones was different from the animal-worship  and adoration of bird-headed deities, which gave the common people such  interest in daily life. They would have been lost without their  monsters; and the priests would have been lost without the temples  necessary for the worship of such a menagerie. For Egypt was a  priest-ridden country in old days. The explanation of the many gods and  goddesses was this: each was a different phase of the one God, Ra, the  Sun, by whom and through whom only the world could exist. Animals and  birds were chosen to express the different phases, because animals were  considered to be nearer nature, therefore nearer God than human beings;  besides, to give a god the head of a man would not set him apart from  humanity, as it would to make him appear with the body of a man and the  head of some bird or beast. Horus, finished off with the head of a hawk  (that sacred bird who could look the sun in the face), became to the  uneducated eye a supernatural being, which he would not have been with  the face of a smiling youth. The child Horus, or Harpocrates, was not  respected as was Horus of the Hawk Head. He was merely petted and  loved. Even Set, god of evil, wasn't all bad. He was the Spirit of  Storm and Strife in Nature, and had to be propitiated by the ignorant.  Typhon, or Typhoon, and he were one. Red was his colour, and red-haired  people were his children. There were a hundred phases of the one god,  each made incarnate, given his own mission, and worshipped in a  different place. It's an ill wind (of Set) that blows nobody good, and  animals had a gorgeous time in those days. Very few weren't sacred for  some reason or other. It was death and destruction to kill a cat. And I  don't think that cats have forgotten to this day the importance they  had in Egypt. It's made them the most supercilious of animals.    \"If Amon-Ra were angry he could become Menthu, the war god. If he were  inclined to be gentle, he could shrink to the dimensions of Horus,  child-god of the Rising Sun. If he were weary, he could rest as the old  god Tum, of the Setting Sun. Probably gods and goddesses never enjoyed  themselves so much as in Ancient Egypt; and though it does seem a  drawback from our artistic point of view for Hathor to have the head or  ears of a cow, for wise Thoth to have the long beak of an ibis, and so  on, it was for them only an amusing kind of masquerade or 'tete' party,  on the walls of the temples and tombs. At home, they could be what they  liked."]]]
