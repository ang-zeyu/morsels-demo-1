Henceforth his creative genius  limited itself to the deepening of its course and the direction of its  outlet.    The Jews had not rested content with murmuring against Mahomet's rule,  they sought to embarrass him by active sedition. One of their first  attempts against Mahomet's regime was to stir up strife between the  Refugees and Helpers. In this they would have been successful but for  Mahomet's efficient system of espionage, a method upon which he relied  throughout his life. Failing to foment a rebellion in secret they  proceeded to open hostilities, and the Muslim, jealous for their faith,  retaliated by contempt and estrangement. During the winter of 623  personal attack was made by the mob upon Mahomet. The people were hounded  on by their leaders to stone the Prophet, but he was warned in time and  escaped their assaults.    The popular fury was merely the reflex of a fundamental division of  thought between the opposing parties. The Jewish and Muslim systems  could never coalesce, for each claimed the dominance and ignored all  compromise. The age-long, hallowed traditions of the Jews which supported  a theocracy as unyielding as any conception of Divine sovereignty  preached by Mahomet, found themselves faced with a new creative force  rapidly evolving its own legends, and strong enough in its enthusiasm to  overwhelm their own. The Rabbis felt that Mahomet and his warrior  heroes--Ali, Omar, Othman, and the rest--would in time dislodge from  their high places their own peculiar saints, just as they saw Mahomet  with Abu Bekr and his personnel of administrators and informers  already overriding their own councillors in the civil and military  departments of their state. The old regime could not amalgamate with the  new, for that would mean absorption by its more vigorous neighbour, and  the Jewish spirit is exclusive in essence and separatist perforce.  Mahomet took no pains to conciliate his allies; they had made a treaty  with him in the days of his insecurity and he was grateful, but now his  position in Medina was beyond assailment, and he was indifferent to their  goodwill. As their aggression increased he deliberately withdrew his  participation in their religious life, and severed his connection with  their rites and ordinances.    The Kibla of the Muslim, whither at every prayer they turned their faces,  and which he had declared to be the Temple at Jerusalem, scene of his  embarkation upon the wondrous \"Midnight Journey,\" was now changed to the  Kaaba at Mecca. What prevision or prophetic inspiration prompted Mahomet  to turn his followers' eyes away from the north and fix them upon their  former home with its fierce and ruthless heat, the materialisation, it  seemed, of his own inexorable and passionate aims? Henceforth Mecca  became unconsciously the goal of every Muslim, the desired city, to be  fought for and died for, the dwelling-place of their Prophet, the crown  of their faith.    The Jewish Fast of Atonement, which plays so important a part in Semite  faith and doctrine, had been made part of the Muslim ritual in 622, while  a federal union still seemed possible, but the next year such an  amalgamation could not take place. In Ramadan (Dec. to January),  therefore, Mahomet instituted a separate fast for the Faithful. It was to  extend throughout the Sacred Month in which the Kuran had first been sent  down to men. Its sanctity became henceforth a potent reminder for the  Muslim of his special duties towards Allah, of the reverence meet to be  accorded to the Divine Upholder of Islam. During all the days of Ramadan,  no food or drink might pass a Muslim lip, nor might he touch a woman, but  the moment the sun's rim dipped below the horizon he was absolved from  the fast until dawn. No institution in Islam is so peculiarly sacred as  Ramadan, and none so scrupulously observed, even when, by the revolution  of the lunar year, the fast falls during the bitter heat of summer. It is  a characteristic ordinance, and one which emphasises the vivid Muslim  apprehension of the part played by abstention in their religious code.  At the end of the fast--that is, upon the sight of the next new  moon--Mahomet proclaimed a festival, Eed-al-Fitr, which was to take the  place of the great Jewish ceremony of rejoicing.    At this time, too, Mahomet, evidently bent on consolidating his religious  observances and regulating their conduct, decreed a fresh institution,  with parallels in no religion--the Adzan, or call to prayer. Mahomet  wished to summon the Believers to the Mosque, and there was no way except  to ring a bell such as the Christians use, which rite was displeasing to  the Faithful. Indeed, Mahomet is reported later to have said, \"The bell  is the devil's musical instrument.\"    But Abdallah, a man of profound faith and love for Islam, received  thereafter a vision wherein a \"spirit, in the guise of man, clad in green  garments,\" appeared to him and summoned him to call the Believers to  prayer from the Mosque at every time set apart for devotion.    \"Call ye four times 'God is great,' and then, 'I bear witness that there  is no God but God, and Mahomet is His Prophet. Come unto prayer, come  unto salvation. God is great; there is no God but Him.'\"    \"A true vision,\" declared Mahomet. \"Go and teach it to Bilal, that he may  call to prayer, for he has a better voice than thou.\"    When Bilal, a slave, received the command, he went up to the Mosque, and  climbing its highest minaret, he cried aloud his summons, adding at each  dawn:    \"Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep.\"    And when Omar heard the call, he went to Mahomet and declared that he had  the previous night received the same vision.    And Mahomet answered him, \"Praise be to Allah!\"    Therewith was inaugurated the most characteristic observance in Islam,  the one which impresses itself very strongly upon the Western traveller  as he hears in the dimness of every dawning, before the sun's edge is  seen in the east, the voices of the Muezzin from each mosque in the city  proclaiming their changeless message, their insistent command to prayer  and praise. He sees the city leap into magical life, the dark figures of  the Muslim hurrying to the Holy Place that lies shimmering in the golden  light of early day, and knows that, behind this outward manifestation,  lies a faith, at root incomprehensible by reason of its aloofness from  the advancing streams of modern thought, a faith spiritually impotent,  since it flees from mysticism, generating an energy which has expended  its vital force in conquest, only to find itself too intellectually  backward and physically sluggish to gather in prosperity the fruits of  its attainments. Its lack of imagination, its utter ignorance of the lure  of what is strange, have been responsible for its achievement of  stupendous tasks, for the driving energy behind was never appalled by  anticipation, nor checked by any realisation of coming stress and terror.  And the same qualities that led the Muslim to world-conquest thereafter  caused their downfall, for their minds could not visualise that world of  imagination necessary for any creative science, while they were not  attuned in intellect for the reception of such generative ideas as have  contributed to the philosophic and speculative development of the Western  world.    All the characteristics which distinguish Islam to the making and the  blasting of its fortunes may be found in embryo in the small Medinan  community; for their leader, by his own creative ardour, imposed upon his  flock every idea which shaped the form and content of its future career  from its rising even to its zenith and decline.          CHAPTER XI      THE BATTLE OF BEDR    _\"They plotted, but God plotted, and of plotters is God the best.\"--The  Koran_.    Mahomet's star, now continually upon the ascendant, flamed into sudden  glory in Ramadan of the second year of the Hegira. Its brilliance and the  bewilderment caused by its triumphant continuance is reflected in all the  chronicles and legends clustered around that period.    If Nakhlu had been an achievement worthy of God's emissary, the victory  which followed it was an irrefutable argument in favour of Mahomet's  divinely ordained rulership of the Arabian peoples. It appeared to the  Muslim, and even to contemporary hostile tribes, nothing less than a  stupendous proof of their championship by God. Muslim poets and  historians are never weary of expatiating upon the glories achieved by  their tiny community with little but abiding zeal and supreme faith with  which to confound their foes. No military event in the life of the  Prophet called forth such rejoicings from his own lips as the triumph at  Bedr:    \"O ye Meccans, if ye desired a decision, now hath the decision come to  you. It will be better for you if ye give over the struggle. If ye  return to it, we will return, and your forces, though they be many, shall  never avail you aught, for God is with the Faithful.\"    Through the whole of Sura viii the strain of exultation runs, the  presentment in dull words of fierce and splendid courage wrought out into  victory in the midst of the storms and lightnings of Heaven.    Such an earth-shaking event, the effects of which reached far beyond its  immediate environment, received fitting treatment at the hands of all  Arabian chronicles, so that we are enabled to reconstruct the events  preceding the battle itself, its action and result, with a vivid  completeness that is often denied us in the lesser events.    The caravan under Abu Sofian, about thirty or forty strong, which had  eluded Mahomet and reached Syria, was now due to return to Mecca with its  bartered merchandise. Mahomet was determined that this time it should not  escape, and that he would exact from it full penalty of the vengeance he  owed the Meccans for his insults and final expulsion from their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#19)"],[1,"down into my boot.'    He knelt, and rolled down the leg of my stocking; but though he only  moved my foot ever so little, it caused me sharp pain, for feeling was  coming back after the first numbness of the shot.    'They have broke the leg, though it bleeds little,' Elzevir said. 'We  have no time to splice it here, but I will put a kerchief round, and  while I wrap it, listen to how we lie, and then choose what we shall do.'    I nodded, biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me, and he went  on: 'We have a quarter of an hour before the Posse can get down to us.  But come they will, and thou canst judge what chance we have to save  liberty or life with that carrion lying by us'--and he jerked his thumb  at Maskew--'though I am glad 'twas not my hand that sent him to his  reckoning, and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a  charge in air. So one thing we can do is to wait here until they come,  and I can account for a few of them before they shoot me down; but thou  canst not fight with a broken leg, and they will take thee alive, and  then there is a dance on air at Dorchester Jail.'    I felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that I was like to  come so soon to such a vile end; so only gave a sigh, wishing heartily  that Maskew were not dead, and that my leg were not broke, but that I was  back again at the Why Not? or even hearing one of Dr. Sherlock's sermons  in my aunt's parlour.    Elzevir looked down at me when I sighed, and seeing, I suppose, that I  was sorrowful, tried to put a better face on a bad business. 'Forgive me,  lad,' he said, 'if I have spoke too roughly. There is yet another way  that we may try; and if thou hadst but two whole legs, I would have tried  it, but now 'tis little short of madness. And yet, if thou fear'st not, I  will still try it. Just at the end of this flat ledge, farthest from  where the bridle-path leads down, but not a hundred yards from where we  stand, there is a sheep-track leading up the cliff. It starts where the  under-cliff dies back again into the chalk face, and climbs by slants and  elbow-turns up to the top. The shepherds call it the Zigzag, and even  sheep lose their footing on it; and of men I never heard but one had  climbed it, and that was lander Jordan, when the Excise was on his heels,  half a century back. But he that tries it stakes all on head and foot,  and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight. Yet, if thou art  content to hang thy life upon a hair, I will carry thee some way; and  where there is no room to carry, thou must down on hands and knees and  trail thy foot.'    It was a desperate chance enough, but came as welcome as a patch of blue  through lowering skies. 'Yes,' I said, 'dear Master Elzevir, let us get  to it quickly; and if we fall, 'tis better far to die upon the rocks  below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail.' And with that I  tried to stand, thinking I might go dot and carry even with a broken leg.  But 'twas no use, and down I sank with a groan. Then Elzevir caught me  up, holding me in his arms, with my head looking over his back, and made  off for the Zigzag. And as we slunk along, close to the cliff-side, I  saw, between the brambles, Maskew lying with his face turned up to the  morning sky. And there was the little red hole in the middle of his  forehead, and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off  on to the sward.    It was a sight to stagger any man, and would have made me swoon perhaps,  but that there was no time, for we were at the end of the under-cliff,  and Elzevir set me down for a minute, before he buckled to his task. And  'twas a task that might cow the bravest, and when I looked upon the  Zigzag, it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands  of the Posse than set foot on that awful way, and fall upon the rocks  below. For the Zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path, but in a  few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the  grey-white cliff-face, and afterwards turned sharply back, crossing a  hundred feet direct above our heads. And then I smelt an evil stench,  and looking about, saw the blown-out carcass of a rotting sheep lie  close at hand.    'Faugh,' said Elzevir, 'tis a poor beast has lost his foothold.'    It was an ill omen enough, and I said as much, beseeching him to make his  own way up the Zigzag and leave me where I was, for that they might have  mercy on a boy.    'Tush!' he cried; 'it is thy heart that fails thee, and 'tis too late now  to change counsel. We have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with, and  if we gain the cliff-top in that time we shall have an hour's start, or  more, for they will take all that to search the under-cliff. And Maskew,  too, will keep them in check a little, while they try to bring the life  back to so good a man. But if we fall, why, we shall fall together, and  outwit their cunning. So shut thy eyes, and keep them tight until I bid  thee open them.' With that he caught me up again, and I shut my eyes  firm, rebuking myself for my faint-heartedness, and not telling him how  much my foot hurt me. In a minute I knew from Elzevir's steps that he  had left the turf and was upon the chalk. Now I do not believe that there  were half a dozen men beside in England who would have ventured up that  path, even free and untrammelled, and not a man in all the world to do it  with a full-grown lad in his arms. Yet Elzevir made no bones of it, nor  spoke a single word; only he went very slow, and I felt him scuffle with  his foot as he set it forward, to make sure he was putting it down firm.    I said nothing, not wishing to distract him from his terrible task, and  held my breath, when I could, so that I might lie quieter in his arms.  Thus he went on for a time that seemed without end, and yet was really  but a minute or two; and by degrees I felt the wind, that we could scarce  perceive at all on the under-cliff, blow fresher and cold on the  cliff-side. And then the path grew steeper and steeper, and Elzevir went  slower and slower, till at last he spoke:    'John, I am going to stop; but open not thy eyes till I have set thee  down and bid thee.'    I did as bidden, and he lowered me gently, setting me on all-fours upon  the path; and speaking again:    'The path is too narrow here for me to carry thee, and thou must creep  round this corner on thy hands and knees. But have a care to keep thy  outer hand near to the inner, and the balance of thy body to the cliff,  for there is no room to dance hornpipes here. And hold thy eyes fixed on  the chalk-wall, looking neither down nor seaward.'    'Twas well he told me what to do, and well I did it; for when I opened my  eyes, even without moving them from the cliff-side, I saw that the ledge  was little more than a foot wide, and that ever so little a lean of the  body would dash me on the rocks below. So I crept on, but spent much time  that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the  first elbow of the path; for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to  drag, though I tried to mask it from Elzevir. And he, forgetting what I  suffered, cried out, 'Quicken thy pace, lad, if thou canst, the time is  short.' Now so frail is man's temper, that though he was doing more than  any ever did to save another's life, and was all I had to trust to in the  world; yet because he forgot my pain and bade me quicken, my choler rose,  and I nearly gave him back an angry word, but thought better of it and  kept it in.    Then he told me to stop, for that the way grew wider and he would pick me  up again. But here was another difficulty, for the path was still so  narrow and the cliff-wall so close that he could not take me up in his  arms. So I lay flat on my face, and he stepped over me, setting his foot  between my shoulders to do it; and then, while he knelt down upon the  path, I climbed up from behind upon him, putting my arms round his neck;  and so he bore me 'pickaback'. I shut my eyes firm again, and thus we  moved along another spell, mounting still and feeling the wind still  freshening.    At length he said that we were come to the last turn of the path, and he  must set me down once more. So down upon his knees and hands he went, and  I slid off behind, on to the ledge. Both were on all-fours now; Elzevir  first and I following. But as I crept along, I relaxed care for a moment,  and my eyes wandered from the cliff-side and looked down. And far below I  saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror, and the gulls wheeling  about the sheer chalk wall, and then I thought of that bloated carcass of  a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps, and in an instant  felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain, and knew that I was  giddy and must fall.    Then I called out to Elzevir, and he, guessing what had come over me,  cries to turn upon my side, and press my belly to the cliff. And how he  did it in such a narrow strait I know not; but he turned round, and lying  down himself, thrust his hand firmly in my back, pressing me closer to  the cliff. Yet it was none too soon, for if he had not held me tight, I  should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that  dreadful sickness.    'Keep thine eyes shut, John,' he said, 'and count up numbers loud to me,  that I may know thou art not turning faint.' So I gave out, 'One, two,  three,' and while I went on counting, heard him repeating to himself,  though his words seemed thin and far off: 'We must have taken ten minutes  to get here, and in five more they will be on the under-cliff; and if we  ever reach the top, who knows but they have left a guard! No, no, they  will not leave a guard, for not a man knows of the Zigzag; and, if they  knew, they would not guess that we should try it. We have but fifty yards  to go to win, and now this cursed giddy fit has come upon the child, and  he "]]]
