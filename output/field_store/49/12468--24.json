Thereto Giuki answered glad-hearted, \"Hail, Sigurd, son  of mine eld!\" and called upon Grimhild the Queen to bless him.    Thus was Sigurd troth-plight to the white-armed Gudrun, and all men  were fain of their love and spake nought but praise of him.      Hark now, on the morrow morning how the blast of the mighty horn    From the builded Burg of the Niblungs goes over the acres shorn,    And the roads are gay with the riders, and the bull in the stall is left,    And the plough is alone in the furrow, and the wedge in the hole half-cleft;    And late shall the ewes be folded, and the kine come home to the pail,    And late shall the fires be litten in the outmost treeless dale:    For men fare to the gate of Giuki and the ancient cloudy hall,    And therein are the earls assembled and the kings wear purple and pall,    And the flowers are spread beneath them, and the bench-cloths beaten with         gold;    And the walls are strange and wondrous with the noble stories told:    For new-hung is the ancient dwelling with the golden spoils of the south,    And men seem merry for ever, and the praise is in each man's mouth,    And the name of Sigurd the Volsung, the King and the Serpent's Bane,    Who exalteth the high this morning and blesseth the masters of gain:    For men drink the bridal of Sigurd and the white-armed Niblung maid,    And the best with the best shall be mingled, and the gold with the gold         o'erlaid.      So, fair in the hall is the feasting and men's hearts are uplifted on high,    And they deem that the best of their life-days are surely drawing anigh,    As now, one after other, uprise the scalds renowned,    And their well-beloved voices awake the hoped-for sound,    In the midmost of the high-tide, and the joy of feasting lords.    Then cometh a hush and a waiting, and the light of many swords    Flows into the hall of Giuki by the doorway of the King,    And amid those flames of battle the war-clad warriors bring    The Cup of daring Promise and the hallowed Boar of Son,    And men's hearts grow big with longing and great is the hope-tide grown;    For bright the Son of Sigmund ariseth by the board    And unwinds the knitted peace-strings that hamper Regin's Sword:    Then fierce is the light on the high-seat as men set down the Cup    Anigh the hand of Sigurd, and the edges blue rise up,    And fall on the hallowed Wood-beast: as a trump of the woeful war    Rings the voice of the mighty Volsung as he speaks the words of yore:      \"By the Earth that groweth and giveth, and by all the Earth's increase    That is spent for Gods and man-folk; by the sun that shines on these;    By the Salt-Sea-Flood that beareth the life and death of men;    By the Heavens and Stars that change not, though earth die out again;    By the wild things of the mountain, and the houseless waste and lone;    By the prey of the Goths in the thicket and the holy Beast of Son,    I hallow me to Odin for a leader of his host,    To do the deeds of the Highest, and never count the cost:    And I swear, that whatso great-one shall show the day and the deed,    I shall ask not why nor wherefore, but the sword's desire shall speed:    And I swear to seek no quarrel, nor to swerve aside for aught,    Though the right and the left be blooming, and the straight way wend to         nought:    And I swear to abide and hearken the prayer of any thrall,    Though the war-torch be on the threshold and the foemen's feet in the hall:    And I swear to sit on my throne in the guise of the kings of the earth,    Though the anguish past amending, and the unheard woe have birth:    And I swear to wend in my sorrow that none shall curse mine eyes    For the scowl that quelleth beseeching, and the hate that scorneth the wise.    So help me Earth and Heavens, and the Under-sky and Seas,    And the Stars in their ordered houses, and the Norns that order these!\"      And he drank of the Cup of the Promise, and fair as a star he shone,    And all men rejoiced and wondered, and deemed Earth's glory won.      Then came the girded maidens, and the slim earls' daughters poured,    And uprose the dark-haired Gunnar and bare was the Niblung sword;    Blue it gleamed in the hand of the folk-king as he laid it low on the Beast,    And took oath as the Goths of aforetime in the hush of the people's feast:    \"I will work for the craving of Kings, and accomplish the will of the great,    Nor ask what God withstandeth, nor hearken the tales of fate;    When a King my life hath exalted, and wrought for my hope and my gain,    For every deed he hath done me, thereto shall I fashion twain.    I shall bear forth the fame of the Niblungs through all that hindereth;    In my life shall I win great glory, and be merry in my death.\"      So sweareth the lovely war-king and drinketh of the Cup,    And the joy of the people waxeth and their glad cry goeth up.    But again came the girded maidens: earls' daughters pour the wine,    And bare is the blade of Hogni in the feast-hall over the Swine;    Then he cries o'er the hallowed Wood-beast: \"Earth, hearken, how I swear,    To beseech no man for his helping, and to vex no God with prayer;    And to seek out the will of the Norns, and look in the eyes of the curse;    And to laugh while the love aboundeth, lest the glad world grow into worse;    Then if in the murder I laugh not, O Earth, remember my name,    And oft tell it aloud to the people for the Niblungs' fated shame!\"      Then he drank of the Cup of the Promise, and all men hearkened and deemed    That his speech was great and valiant, and as one of the wise he seemed.      Then the linen-folded maidens of the earl-folk lift the gold,    But the earls look each on the other, and Guttorm's place behold,    And empty it lieth before them; for the child hath wearied of peace,    And he sits by the oars in the East-seas, and winneth fame's increase.    Nor then, nor ever after, o'er the Holy Beast he spake,    When mighty hearts were exalted for the golden Sigurd's sake.      _Sigurd rideth with the Niblungs, and wooeth Brynhild for King Gunnar._      Now it fell on a day of the spring-tide that followed on these things,    That Sigurd fares to the meadows with Gunnar and Hogni the Kings;    For afar is Guttorm the youngest, and he sails the Eastern Seas,    And fares with war-shield hoisted to win him fame's increase.           *       *       *       *       *      There stay those Kings of the people alone in weed of war,    And they cut a strip of the greensward on the meadow's daisied floor,    And loosen it clean in the midst, while its ends in the earth abide;    Then they heave its midmost aloft, and set on either side    An ancient spear of battle writ round with words of worth;    And these are the posts of the door, whose threshold is of the earth,    And the skin of the earth is its lintel: but with war-glaives gleaming bare    The Niblung Kings and Sigurd beneath the earth-yoke fare;    Then each an arm-vein openeth, and their blended blood falls down    On Earth the fruitful Mother where they rent her turfy gown:    And then, when the blood of the Volsungs hath run with the Niblung blood,    They kneel with their hands upon it and swear the brotherhood:    Each man at his brother's bidding to come with the blade in his hand,    Though the fire and the flood should sunder, and the very Gods withstand:    Each man to love and cherish his brother's hope and will;    Each man to avenge his brother when the Norns his fate fulfill:    And now are they foster-brethren, and in such wise have they sworn    As the God-born Goths of aforetime, when the world was newly born.    But among the folk of the Niblungs goes forth the tale of the same,    And men deem the tidings a glory and the garland of their fame.      So is Sigurd yet with the Niblungs, and he loveth Gudrun his wife,    And wendeth afield with the brethren to the days of the dooming of life;    And nought his glory waneth, nor falleth the flood of praise:    To every man he hearkeneth, nor gainsayeth any grace,    And glad is the poor in the Doom-ring when he seeth his face mid the Kings,    For the tangle straighteneth before him, and the maze of crooked things.    But the smile is departed from him, and the laugh of Sigurd the young,    And of few words now is he waxen, and his songs are seldom sung.    Howbeit of all the sad-faced was Sigurd loved the best;    And men say: Is the king's heart mighty beyond all hope of rest?    Lo, how he beareth the people! how heavy their woes are grown!    So oft were a God mid the Goth-folk, if he dwelt in the world alone.    Now Giuki the king was long grown old, and he died and was buried  beneath a great earth-mound high on the mountains.      So there lieth Giuki the King, mid steel and the glimmer of gold,    As the sound of the feastful Niblungs round his misty house is rolled:    But Gunnar is King of the people, and the chief of the Niblung land;    A man beloved for his mercy, and his might and his open hand;    A glorious king in the battle, a hearkener at the doom,    A singer to sing the sun up from the heart of the midnight gloom.      On a day sit the Kings in the high-seat when Grimhild saith to her son:    \"O Gunnar, King beloved, a fair life hast thou won;    On the flood, in the field hast thou wrought, and hung the chambers with         gold;    Far abroad mid many a people are the tidings of thee told:    Now do a deed for thy mother and the hallowed Niblung hearth,    Lest the house of the mighty perish, and our tale grow wan with dearth.    If thou do the deed that I bid thee, and wed a wife of the Kings,    No less shalt thou cleave the war-helms and scatter the ruddy rings.\"      He said: \"Meseemeth, mother, thou speakest not in haste,    But hast sought and found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#19)"],[1,"fault of the present day, viz.  extravagance. It is useless to expend our ingenuity in purifying the  stream, unless the fountain be cleansed. If young men and young  women are brought up to consider frugality contemptible, and industry  degrading, it is vain to expect they will at once become prudent and  useful, when the cares of life press heavily upon them. Generally  speaking, when misfortune comes upon those who have been accustomed to  thoughtless expenditure, it sinks them to discouragement, or, what is  worse, drives them to desperation. It is true there are exceptions.  There are a few, an honorable few, who, late in life, with Roman  severity of resolution, learn the long-neglected lesson of economy.  But how small is the number, compared with the whole mass of the  population! And with what bitter agony, with what biting humiliation,  is the hard lesson often learned! How easily might it have been  engrafted on _early habits_, and naturally and gracefully 'grown with  their growth, and strengthened with their strength!'    Yet it was but lately that I visited a family, not of 'moderate  fortune,' but of no fortune at all; one of those people who live  'nobody knows how;' and I found a young girl, about sixteen,  practising on the piano, while an elderly lady beside her was darning  her stockings. I was told (for the mother was proud of bringing up her  child so genteelly) that the daughter had almost forgotten how to  sew, and that a woman was hired into the house to do her mending! 'But  why,' said I, 'have you suffered your daughter to be ignorant of so  useful an employment? If she is poor, the knowledge will be necessary  to her; if she is rich, it is the easiest thing in the world to lay it  aside, if she chooses; she will merely be a better judge whether her  work is well done by others.' 'That is true,' replied the mother; 'and  I always meant she should learn; but she never has seemed to have any  time. When she was eight years old, she could put a shirt together  pretty well; but since that, her music, and her dancing, and her  school, have taken up her whole time. I did mean she should learn  some domestic habits this winter; but she has so many visiters, and is  obliged to go out so much, that I suppose I must give it up. I don't  like to say too much about it; for, poor girl! she does so love  company, and she does so hate anything like care and confinement!  _Now_ is her time to enjoy herself, you know. Let her take all the  comfort she can, while she is single!' 'But,' said I, 'you wish her  to marry some time or other; and, in all probability, she will marry.  When will she learn how to perform the duties, which are necessary  and important to every mistress of a family?' 'Oh, she will learn  them when she is obliged to,' answered the injudicious mother; 'at all  events, I am determined she shall enjoy herself while she is young.'    And this is the way I have often heard mothers talk! Yet, could  parents foresee the almost inevitable consequences of such a system, I  believe the weakest and vainest would abandon the false and dangerous  theory. What a lesson is taught a girl in that sentence, '_Let  her enjoy herself all she can, while she is single_!' Instead of  representing domestic life as the gathering place of the deepest and  purest affections; as the sphere of woman's _enjoyments_ as well as of  her _duties_; as, indeed, the whole world to her; that one pernicious  sentence teaches a girl to consider matrimony desirable because 'a  good match' is a triumph of vanity, and it is deemed respectable to  be 'well settled in the world;' but that it is a necessary sacrifice  of her freedom and her gayety. And then how many affectionate  dispositions have been trained into heartlessness, by being taught  that the indulgence of indolence and vanity were necessary to their  happiness; and that to have this indulgence, they _must_ marry money!  But who that marries for money, in this land of precarious fortunes,  can tell how soon they will lose the glittering temptation, to which  they have been willing to sacrifice so much? And even if riches last  as long as life, the evil is not remedied. Education has given a wrong  end and aim to their whole existence; they have been taught to look  for happiness where it never can be found, viz. in the absence of  all occupation, or the unsatisfactory and ruinous excitement of  fashionable competition.    The difficulty is, education does not usually point the female heart  to its only true resting-place. That dear English word '_home_,'  is not half so powerful a talisman as '_the world_.' Instead of  the salutary truth, that happiness is _in_ duty, they are taught to  consider the two things totally distinct; and that whoever seeks one,  must sacrifice the other.    The fact is, our girls have no _home education_. When quite young,  they are sent to schools where no feminine employments, no domestic  habits, can be learned; and there they continue till they 'come out'  into the world. After this, few find any time to arrange, and make  use of, the mass of elementary knowledge they have acquired; and fewer  still have either leisure or taste for the inelegant, every-day duties  of life. Thus prepared, they enter upon matrimony. Those early habits,  which would have made domestic care a light and easy task, have never  been taught, for fear it would interrupt their happiness; and the  result is, that when cares come, as come they must, they find them  misery. I am convinced that indifference and dislike between husband  and wife are more frequently occasioned by this great error in  education, than by any other cause.    The bride is awakened from her delightful dream, in which carpets,  vases, sofas, white gloves, and pearl earrings, are oddly jumbled up  with her lover's looks and promises. Perhaps she would be surprised  if she knew exactly how _much_ of the fascination of being engaged  was owing to the aforesaid inanimate concern. Be that as it will, she  is awakened by the unpleasant conviction that cares devolve upon her.  And what effect does this produce upon her character? Do the holy and  tender influences of domestic love render self-denial and exertion a  bliss? No! They would have done so, had she been _properly educated_;  but now she gives way to unavailing fretfulness and repining; and  her husband is at first pained, and finally disgusted, by hearing,  'I never knew what care was when I lived in my father's house.' 'If  I were to live my life over again, I would remain single as long as  I could, without the risk of being an old maid.' How injudicious, how  short-sighted is the policy, which thus mars the whole happiness of  life, in order to make a few brief years more gay and brilliant! I  have known many instances of domestic ruin and discord produced by  this mistaken indulgence of mothers. _I never knew but one, where  the victim had moral courage enough to change all her early habits._  She was a young, pretty, and very amiable girl; but brought up to be  perfectly useless; a rag baby would, to all intents and purposes,  have been as efficient a partner. She married a young lawyer, without  property, but with good and increasing practice. She meant to be a  good wife, but she did not know how. Her wastefulness involved him in  debt. He did not reproach, though he tried to convince and instruct  her. She loved him; and weeping replied, 'I try to do the best I can;  but when I lived at home, mother always took care of everything.'  Finally, poverty came upon him 'like an armed man;' and he went into  a remote town in the Western States to teach a school. His wife folded  her hands, and cried; while he, weary and discouraged, actually came  home from school to cook his own supper. At last, his patience, and  her real love for him, impelled her to exertion. She promised to  learn to be useful, if he would teach her. And she did learn! And the  change in her habits gradually wrought such a change in her husband's  fortune, that she might bring her daughters up in idleness, had not  experience taught her that economy, like grammar, is a very hard and  tiresome study, after we are twenty years old.    Perhaps some will think the evils of which I have been speaking are  confined principally to the rich; but I am convinced they extend to  all classes of people. All manual employment is considered degrading;  and those who are compelled to do it, try to conceal it. A few years  since, very respectable young men at our colleges, cut their own wood,  and blacked their own shoes. Now, how few, even of the sons of plain  farmers and industrious mechanics, have moral courage enough to do  without a servant; yet when they leave college, and come out into the  battle of life, they _must_ do without servants; and in these times  it will be fortunate if one half of them get what is called 'a decent  living,' even by rigid economy and patient toil. Yet I would not that  servile and laborious employment should be forced upon the young.  I would merely have each one educated according to his probable  situation in life; and be taught that whatever is his duty, is  honorable; and that no merely external circumstance can in reality  injure true dignity of character. I would not cramp a boy's energies  by compelling him always to cut wood, or draw water; but I would teach  him not to be ashamed, should his companions happen to find him doing  either one or the other. A few days since, I asked a grocer's lad to  bring home some articles I had just purchased at his master's. The  bundle was large; he was visibly reluctant to take it; and wished very  much that I should send for it. This, however, was impossible; and he  subdued his pride; but when I asked him to take back an empty bottle  which belonged to the store, he, with a mortified look, begged me to  do it up neatly in a paper, that it might look like a small package.
