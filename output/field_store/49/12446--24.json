From the  saddle-bag, he brought a parcel, and lightly laying this beside Bokay  Baldy, he mounted and was gone. When Baldy awoke later, he found the  parcel to be a pair of flowery slippers.    In selecting the inert Virginian as the fool, Mr. McLean was scarcely  wise; it is the absent who are always guilty.    Before ever Lin could have been a mile in retreat, the rattle of  the wheels roused all of them, and here came the Taylors. Before the  Taylors' knocking had brought the Swintons to their door, other wheels  sounded, and here were Mr. and Mrs. Carmody, and Uncle Hughey with his  wife, and close after them Mr. Dow, alone, who told how his wife had  gone into one of her fits--she upon whom Dr. Barker at Drybone had  enjoined total abstinence from all excitement. Voices of women and  children began to be uplifted; the Westfalls arrived in a lather,  and the Thomases; and by sunrise, what with fathers and mothers and  spectators and loud offspring, there was gathered such a meeting as has  seldom been before among the generations of speaking men. To-day you can  hear legends of it from Texas to Montana; but I am giving you the full  particulars.    Of course they pitched upon poor Lin. Here was the Virginian doing  his best, holding horses and helping ladies descend, while the name of  McLean began to be muttered with threats. Soon a party led by Mr. Dow  set forth in search of him, and the Southerner debated a moment if he  had better not put them on a wrong track. But he concluded that they  might safely go on searching.    Mrs. Westfall found Christopher at once in the green shawl of Anna  Maria Dow, but all was not achieved thus in the twinkling of an eye. Mr.  McLean had, it appeared, as James Westfall lugubriously pointed out, not  merely \"swapped the duds; he had shuffled the whole doggone deck;\" and  they cursed this Satanic invention. The fathers were but of moderate  assistance; it was the mothers who did the heavy work; and by ten  o'clock some unsolved problems grew so delicate that a ladies' caucus  was organized in a private room,--no admittance for men,--and what was  done there I can only surmise.    During its progress the search party returned. It had not found Mr.  McLean. It had found a tree with a notice pegged upon it, reading, \"God  bless our home!\" This was captured.    But success attended the caucus; each mother emerged, satisfied that  she had received her own, and each sire, now that his family was itself  again, began to look at his neighbor sideways. After a man has been  angry enough to kill another man, after the fire of righteous slaughter  has raged in his heart as it had certainly raged for several hours in  the hearts of these fathers, the flame will usually burn itself out.  This will be so in a generous nature, unless the cause of the anger is  still unchanged. But the children had been identified; none had taken  hurt. All had been humanely given their nourishment. The thing was over.  The day was beautiful. A tempting feast remained from the barbecue.  These Bear Creek fathers could not keep their ire at red heat. Most  of them, being as yet more their wives' lovers than their children's  parents, began to see the mirthful side of the adventure; and they  ceased to feel very severely toward Lin McLean.    Not so the women. They cried for vengeance; but they cried in vain, and  were met with smiles.    Mrs. Westfall argued long that punishment should be dealt the offender.  \"Anyway,\" she persisted, \"it was real defiant of him putting that up on  the tree. I might forgive him but for that.\"    \"Yes,\" spoke the Virginian in their midst, \"that wasn't sort o' right.  Especially as I am the man you're huntin'.\"    They sat dumb at his assurance.    \"Come and kill me,\" he continued, round upon the party. \"I'll not  resist.\"    But they could not resist the way in which he had looked round upon  them. He had chosen the right moment for his confession, as a captain  of a horse awaits the proper time for a charge. Some rebukes he did  receive; the worst came from the mothers. And all that he could say for  himself was, \"I am getting off too easy.\"    \"But what was your point?\" said Westfall.    \"Blamed if I know any more. I expect it must have been the whiskey.\"    \"I would mind it less,\" said Mrs. Westfall, \"if you looked a bit sorry  or ashamed.\"    The Virginian shook his head at her penitently. \"I'm tryin' to,\" he  said.    And thus he sat disarming his accusers until they began to lunch upon  the copious remnants of the barbecue. He did not join them at this meal.  In telling you that Mrs. Dow was the only lady absent upon this historic  morning, I was guilty of an inadvertence. There was one other.    The Virginian rode away sedately through the autumn sunshine; and as  he went he asked his Monte horse a question. \"Do yu' reckon she'll have  forgotten you too, you pie-biter?\" said he. Instead of the new trousers,  the cow-puncher's leathern chaps were on his legs. But he had the new  scarf knotted at his neck. Most men would gladly have equalled him in  appearance. \"You Monte,\" said he, \"will she be at home?\"    It was Sunday, and no school day, and he found her in her cabin that  stood next the Taylors' house. Her eyes were very bright.    \"I'd thought I'd just call,\" said he.    \"Why, that's such a pity! Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are away.\"    \"Yes; they've been right busy. That's why I thought I'd call. Will yu'  come for a ride, ma'am?\"    \"Dear me! I--\"    \"You can ride my hawss. He's gentle.\"    \"What! And you walk?\"    \"No, ma'am. Nor the two of us ride him THIS time, either.\" At this she  turned entirely pink, and he, noticing, went on quietly: \"I'll catch up  one of Taylor's hawsses. Taylor knows me.\"    \"No. I don't really think I could do that. But thank you. Thank you very  much. I must go now and see how Mrs. Taylor's fire is.\"    \"I'll look after that, ma'am. I'd like for yu' to go ridin' mighty well.  Yu' have no babies this mawnin' to be anxious after.\"    At this shaft, Grandmother Stark flashed awake deep within the spirit of  her descendant, and she made a haughty declaration of war. \"I don't know  what you mean, sir,\" she said.    Now was his danger; for it was easy to fall into mere crude impertinence  and ask her why, then, did she speak thus abruptly? There were various  easy things of this kind for him to say. And any rudeness would have  lost him the battle. But the Virginian was not the man to lose such  a battle in such a way. His shaft had hit. She thought he referred  to those babies about whom last night she had shown such superfluous  solicitude. Her conscience was guilty. This was all that he had wished  to make sure of before he began operations.    \"Why, I mean,\" said he, easily, sitting down near the door, \"that it's  Sunday. School don't hinder yu' from enjoyin' a ride to-day. You'll  teach the kids all the better for it to-morro', ma'am. Maybe it's your  duty.\" And he smiled at her.    \"My duty! It's quite novel to have strangers--\"    \"Am I a stranger?\" he cut in, firing his first broadside. \"I was  introduced, ma'am,\" he continued, noting how she had flushed again. \"And  I would not be oversteppin' for the world. I'll go away if yu' want.\"  And hereupon he quietly rose, and stood, hat in hand.    Molly was flustered. She did not at all want him to go. No one of  her admirers had ever been like this creature. The fringed leathern  chaparreros, the cartridge belt, the flannel shirt, the knotted scarf at  the neck, these things were now an old story to her. Since her arrival  she had seen young men and old in plenty dressed thus. But worn by this  man now standing by her door, they seemed to radiate romance. She did  not want him to go--and she wished to win her battle. And now in  her agitation she became suddenly severe, as she had done at Hoosic  Junction. He should have a punishment to remember!    \"You call yourself a man, I suppose,\" she said.    But he did not tremble in the least. Her fierceness filled him with  delight, and the tender desire of ownership flooded through him.    \"A grown-up, responsible man,\" she repeated.    \"Yes, ma'am. I think so.\" He now sat down again.    \"And you let them think that--that Mr. McLean--You dare not look me in  the face and say that Mr. McLean did that last night!\"    \"I reckon I dassent.\"    \"There! I knew it! I said so from the first!\"    \"And me a stranger to you!\" he murmured.    It was his second broadside. It left her badly crippled. She was silent.    \"Who did yu' mention it to, ma'am?\"    She hoped she had him. \"Why, are you afraid?\" And she laughed lightly.    \"I told 'em myself. And their astonishment seemed so genu-wine I'd just  hate to think they had fooled me that thorough when they knowed it all  along from you seeing me.\"    \"I did not see you. I knew it must--of course I did not tell any one.  When I said I said so from the first, I meant--you can understand  perfectly what I meant.\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    Poor Molly was near stamping her foot. \"And what sort of a trick,\" she  rushed on, \"was that to play? Do you call it a manly thing to frighten  and distress women because you--for no reason at all? I should never  have imagined it could be the act of a person who wears a big pistol and  rides a big horse. I should be afraid to go riding with such an immature  protector.\"    \"Yes; that was awful childish. Your words do cut a little; for maybe  there's been times when I have acted pretty near like a man. But I  cert'nly forgot to be introduced before I spoke to yu' last night.  Because why? You've found me out dead in one thing.

Clause the twenty-eighth enacts \"That the said Board  shall make provision for the management and conduct, by persons  appointed by them, of the funerals of persons whose bodies are to be  interred in the Burial Grounds, to be provided under this Act, where  the representatives of the deceased, or the persons having the care  and direction of the funeral, desire to have the same so conducted;  and the said Board shall fix and publish a scale of the sums to be  payable for such funerals, inclusive of all matters and services  necessary for the same, such sums to be proportioned to the  description of the funeral, or the nature of the matter and services  to be furnished and rendered for the same; but so that in respect of  the lowest of such sums, the funerals may be conducted with decency  and solemnity.\" Gentlemen, if this enactment becomes law, we shall  lose all the advantages which we derived from bereaved parties' state  of mind. The Board of Health will take all trouble off their hands, at  whatever sum they may choose to name. Of course they will apply to the  Board of Health instead of coming to us. But what is beyond everything  prejudicial to our interests, is the proviso \"that in respect of the  lowest of such sums, the funerals may be conducted with decency and  solemnity.\" Hitherto it has been understood that so much respect could  not be paid in the case of what we call a low affair as in one of a  certain style. We have always considered that a funeral ought to cost  so much to be respectable at all. Therefore relations have gone to  more expense with us, than they would otherwise have been willing to  incur, in order to secure proper respect. But if proper respect is to  be had at a low figure, the strongest hold that we have upon sorrowing  relatives will be taken away.    It is all very fine to say that we are a necessary class of tradesmen,  and if this Bill passes must continue to be employed. If this Bill  does pass we shall be employed simply as tradesmen, and shall obtain,  like other tradesmen, a mere market price for our articles, and common  hire for our labor. I am afraid that it will be impossible to persuade  the public that this would not be perfectly just and right. I think,  therefore, that we had better not attack the Bill on its merits, but  try to excite opposition against it on the ground of its accessory  clauses. Let us oppose it as a scheme of jobbery, devised with a view  to the establishment of offices and appointments. Let us complain as  loudly as we can of its creating a new rate to defray the expenses of  its working, and let us endeavor to get up a good howl against that  clause of it which provides for compensation to incumbents, clerks,  and sextons. We must cry out with all our might upon its centralizing  tendency, and of course make the most we can out of the pretense that  it violates the sanctity of the house of mourning, and outrages the  most fondly cherished feelings of Englishmen. Urge these objections  upon church-wardens, overseers, and vestrymen; and especially din the  objection to a burial rate into their ears. Recollect, our two great  weapons--like those of all good old anti-reformers--are cant and  clamor. Keep up the same cry against the Bill perseveringly, no matter  how thoroughly it may be refuted or proved absurd. Literally, make the  greatest noise in opposition to it that you are able, especially at  public meetings. There, recollect a groan is a groan, and a hiss a  hiss, even though proceeding from a goose. On all such occasions  do your utmost to create a disturbance, to look like a popular  demonstration against the measure. In addition to shouting, yelling,  and bawling, I should say that another rush at another platform,  another upsetting of the reporter's table, another terrifying of the  ladies, and another mobbing the chairman, would be advisable. Set to  work with all your united zeal and energy to carry out the suggestions  of our Central Committee for the defeat of a Bill which, if passed,  will inflict a blow on the undertaker as great as the boon it will  confer on the widow and orphan--whom we, of course, can only consider  as customers. The Metropolitan Interments Bill goes to dock us of  every penny that we make by taking advantage of the helplessness of  afflicted families. And just calculate what our loss would then be;  for, in the beautiful language of St. Demetrius, the silversmith,  \"Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.\"           *       *       *       *       *    FROM MISS FENIMORE COOPER'S (UNPUBLISHED) \"RURAL HOURS.\"    FIRE IN THE WOODS.    Observing an old branchless trunk of the largest size, in a striking  position, where it looked like a broken column, we walked up to  examine it. The shaft rose, without a curve or a branch, to the height  of perhaps forty feet, where it had been abruptly shivered, probably  in some storm. The tree was a chestnut, and the bark of a clear,  unsullied gray; walking round it, we saw an opening near the ground,  and to our surprise found the trunk hollow, and entirely charred  within, black as a chimney, from the root to the point where it was  broken off. It frequently happens that fire steals into the heart of  an old tree, in this way, by some opening near the roots, and burns  away the inside, leaving merely a gray outer shell. One would not  expect the bark to be left in such cases, but the wood at the heart  seems to be more inflammable than the outer growth. Whatever be the  cause, such shafts are not uncommon about our hills, gray without,  charred within.    There is, indeed, much charred wood in our forests; fires which sweep  over the hills are of frequent occurrence here, and at times they do  much mischief. If the flames are once fairly kindled in dry weather,  they will spread in all directions as the wind varies, burning  sometimes for weeks together, until they have swept over miles of  woodland, withering the verdure, destroying the wood already cut, and  greatly injuring many trees which they do not consume. Several years  since, in the month of June, there was quite an extensive fire on  the eastern range of hills; it lasted for ten days or a fortnight,  spreading several miles in different directions. It was the first  important fire of the kind we had ever seen, and of course we  watched its progress with much interest; but the spectacle was a very  different one from what we had supposed. It was much less terrible  than the conflagration of buildings in a town; there was less of power  and fierce grandeur, and more of treacherous beauty about the flames  as they ran hither and thither along the mountain-side. The first  night after it broke out we looked on with admiration: one might have  thought it a general illumination of the forest, as the flames spread  in long winding lines, gaining upon the dark wood every moment, up  and down, and across the hill, collecting here and there with greater  brilliancy about some tall old tree, which they hung with fire like  a giant lustre. But the next day the sight was a sad one indeed: the  deceitful brilliancy of the flames no longer pleased the eye: wreaths  of dull smoke and hot vapors hung over the blighted trees, and  wherever the fire had wandered there the fresh June foliage was  utterly blasted. That night we could no longer take pleasure in the  spectacle; we could no longer fancy a joyous illumination. We seemed  rather to behold the winding coils of some fiery serpent gliding  farther and farther on its path of evil: a rattling, hissing sound  accompanying its movement, the young trees trembling and quivering  with agitation in the heated current which proclaimed its approach.  The fresh flowers were all blighted by its scorching breath, and with  its forked tongue it fed upon the pride of the forest, drying up the  life of great trees, and without waiting to consume them, hurrying  onward to blight other groves, leaving a blackened track of ruin  wherever it passed.    Some fifty years since a fire of this kind is said to have spread  until it inclosed within its lines the lake and the valley, as far as  one could see, surrounding the village with a network of flame, which  at night was quite appalling in its aspect. The danger, however, was  not so great as it appeared, as there was everywhere a cleared space  between the burning forest and the little town. At times, however,  very serious accidents result from these fires: within a few days we  have heard of a small village, in the northern part of the State,  in St. Lawrence county, entirely destroyed in this way, the flames  gaining so rapidly upon the poor people that they were obliged to  collect their families and cattle in boats and upon rafts, in the  nearest pools and streams.    Of course, more or less mischief is always done; the wood and timber  already cut are destroyed, fences are burnt, many trees are killed,  others are much injured, the foliage is more or less blighted for the  season; the young plants are killed, and the earth looks black and  gloomy. Upon the whole, however, it is surprising that no more harm is  done. On the occasion of the fire referred to in these woods, we found  the traces of the flames to disappear much sooner than we had supposed  possible. The next season the smaller plants were all replaced by  others; many of the younger trees seemed to revive, and a stranger  passing over the ground to-day would scarcely believe that fire had  been feeding on those woods for a fortnight only a few seasons back.  A group of tall, blasted hemlocks, on the verge of the wood, is the  striking monument of the event. The evergreens generally suffer more  than other trees, and for some cause or other the fire continued busy  at that point for several days. We repeatedly passed along the highway  at the time, with the flames at work on either side. Of course,"]]]
