Then a wall of earth  seemed to rise up in front of the advancing wall of water. High into  the air great stones and masses of dirt were thrown.    \"A good shot!\" cried the foreman. \"Just in the right place, Tom Swift!\"    For a moment it was as though that wall of water hesitated, not  deciding whether to continue on down the populated valley, or to swing  over into the other gash where it could do comparatively little harm.  It was a moment of suspense.    Then, as Tom's great shot had, by means of the exploding projectile,  torn down the barrier, the water chose the more direct and shorter  path. With a mighty roar, like a distant Niagara, it swept into the new  channel the young inventor had made. Into the transverse valley it  tumbled and tossed in muddy billows of foam, and only a small portion  of the flood added itself to the already swollen creek.    The village of Preston had been saved by the shot from Tom's giant  cannon.          CHAPTER XX    THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS      \"Whew! Let me sit down somewhere and get my breath!\" gasped Tom, when  it was all over.    \"I should think you would want a bit of quiet,\" replied Ned.  \"You've  been on the jump since early morning.\"    \"Bless my dining-room table!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I should say so! I'll  go tell the cook to get us all a good meal--we need it,\" for a  competent cook had been installed in the old farmhouse where Tom and  his party had their headquarters.    \"But you did the trick, Tom, old man!\" exclaimed Ned, fervently, as he  looked down the valley and saw the receding water. For, with the  opening of the channel into the other valley the flood, at no time  particularly dangerous near Preston, was subsiding rapidly.    \"He sure did,\" declared the foreman. \"No one else could have done it,  either.\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" spoke Tom, modestly. \"It just happened so.  There  was one minute, though, after I got to the place in Preston where I had  stored the powder, that I didn't know whether I would succeed or not.\"    \"How was that?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Why, in my hurry and excitement I forgot the key to the underground  storeroom where I had put the explosive. I knew there was no time to  get another, so I took a chance and burst in the door with an axe I  found in the freight depot.\"    \"I should say you did take a chance!\" declared Ned, who knew how  \"freaky\" the high explosive was, and how likely it was, at times, to be  set off by the least concussion.    \"But it came out all right,\" went on Tom. \"I bundled it into the other  seat of my Humming Bird, and started back.\"    \"Had most of the folks left town?\" asked the foreman.    \"Nearly all,\" replied Tom. \"The last of them were hurrying away as I  left. And it shows how scared they were, they didn't pay any attention  to me and my flying machine, though I'll wager some of them never saw  one before.\"    \"Well, they don't need to be scared any more,\" put in Mr. Damon \"You  saved their homes for them, Tom.\"    \"I'd like to get hold of the fellow who doped my powder; that's what  I'd like to do,\" murmured the young inventor. \"Ned, we'll have to be  doubly watchful from now on. But I must take a look at my gun. That  last charge may have strained it.\"    But the giant cannon was as perfect as the day it was turned out of the  shop. Not even the extra charge of the powerful explosive had injured  it.    \"That's fine!\" cried Tom, as he looked at every part. \"As soon as this  flood is over we'll try some more practice shots. But we're all  entitled to a rest now.\"    The great gun was covered with tarpaulins to protect it from the  weather, and then all retired to the house for a bountiful meal. Late  that afternoon nearly all signs of the flood had disappeared, save that  along the edges of the creek was much driftwood, showing the height to  which the creek had risen. But it would have gone much higher had it  not been for Tom's timely shot.    The water from the impounded lake continued to pour down into the cross  valley, and did some damage, but nothing like what would have followed  its advent into Preston. The few inhabitants of the gulch into which  the young inventor had directed the flood had had warning, and had fled  in time. In Preston, some few houses nearest the banks of the rising  creek were flooded, but were not carried away.    The following day some of the officers of the water company paid a  visit to Tom, to thank him for what he had done. But for him they would  have been responsible for great property damage, and loss of life might  have followed.    They intended to rebuild the dam, they said, on a new principle, making  it much stronger.    \"And,\" said the president, \"we will have an emergency outlet gate into  that valley you so providentially opened for us, Mr. Swift. Then, in  time of great rain, we can let the water out slowly as we need to.\"    Tom's chief anxiety, now, was to bring his perfected gun to the notice  of the United States Government officials. To have them accept it, he  knew he must give it a test before the ordnance board, and before the  officers of the army and navy. Accordingly he prepared for this.    He ordered several new projectiles, some of a different type from those  heretofore used, and leaving Koku and Ned in charge of the gun, went  back to Shopton to superintend the manufacture of an additional supply  of his explosive. He took care, too, that no spies gained access to it.    Then, with a plentiful supply of ammunition and projectiles, Tom  resumed his practice in the lonely valley. He had, in the meanwhile,  sent requests to the proper government officials to come and witness  the tests.    At first he met with no success, and he learned, incidentally, that  General Waller had built a new gun, the merits of which he was also  anxious to show.    \"It's a sort of rivalry between us,\" said Tom to Ned.    But, in a way, fortune favored our hero. For when General Waller tested  his new gun, though it did not burst, it did not come up to  expectations, and its range was not as great as some of the weapons  already in use.    Then, too, Captain Badger acted as Tom's friend at court. He \"pulled  wires\" to good advantage, and at last the government sent word that one  of the ordnance officers would be present on a certain day to witness  the tests.    \"I wish the whole board had come,\" said Tom. \"Probably they have only  sent a young fellow, just out of West Point, who will turn me down.    \"But I'm going to give him the surprise of his life; and if he doesn't  report favorably, and insist on the whole board coming out here, I'll  be much disappointed.\"    Tom made his preparations carefully, and certainly Captain Waydell, the  young officer who came to represent Uncle Sam, was impressed. Tom sent  shell after shell, heavily charged, against the side of the mountain.  Great holes and gashes were torn in the earth. The gun even exceeded  the range of thirty miles. And the heaviest armor plate that could be  procured was to the projectiles of the giant cannon like cheese to a  revolver bullet.    \"It's great, Mr. Swift! Great!\" declared the young captain. \"I shall  strongly recommend that the entire board see this test.\" And when Tom  let him fire the gun himself the young man was more than delighted.    He was as good as his word, and a week later the entire ordnance board,  from the youngest member to the grave and grizzled veterans, were  present to witness the test of Tom's giant cannon.    It is needless to say that it was successful. Tom and Ned, not to  mention Mr. Damon, Koku and every loyal member of the steel working  gang, saw to it that there was no hitch. The solid shots were regarded  with wonder, and when the explosive one was sent against the hillside,  making a geyser of earth, the enthusiasm was unbounded.    \"We shall certainly recommend your gun, Mr. Swift,\" declared the Chief  of Staff. \"It does just what we want it to do, and we have no doubt  that Congress will appropriate the money for several with which to  fortify the Panama Canal.\"    \"The gun is most wonderful,\" spoke a voice with a German accent. \"It is  surprising!\"    Tom and Ned both started. They saw an officer, evidently a foreigner,  resplendent in gold trimmings, and with many medals, standing near the  secretary of the ordnance board.    \"Yes, General von Brunderger,\" agreed the chief, \"it is a most timely  invention. Mr. Swift, allow me to present you to General von  Brunderger, of the German army, who is here learning how Uncle Sam does  things.\"    Tom bowed and shook hands. He glanced sharply at the German, but was  sure he had never seen him before. Then all the board, and General von  Brunderger, who, it appeared, was present as an invited guest, examined  the big cannon critically, while Tom explained the various details.    When the board members left, the chief promised to let Tom know the  result of the formal report as soon as possible.    The young inventor did not have long to wait. In about two weeks,  during which time he and Ned perfected several little matters about the  cannon, there came an official-looking document.    \"Well, we'll soon know the verdict,\" spoke Tom, somewhat nervously, as  he opened the envelope. Quickly he read the enclosure.    \"What is it!\" cried Ned.    \"The government accepts my gun!\" exclaimed the young inventor.  \"It  will purchase a number as soon as they can be made. We are to take one  to Panama, where it will be set up. Hurray, Ned, my boy!  Now for  Panama!\"          CHAPTER XXI    OFF FOR PANAMA      \"Well, Tom, it doesn't seem possible; does it, old man?\"    \"You're right, Ned--in a way. And yet, after all the hard work we've  done, almost anything is possible.\"    \"Hard work! We? Oh, pshaw! You've done most of it, Tom. I only helped  here and there.\"    \"Indeed, and you did more than that. If it hadn't been for you, Mr.  Damon and Koku we'd never have gotten off as soon as we did.

We  see the influence of this defence against strange eyes in the special  precautions in gesture or clothing taken by the women in various parts of  the world, against the more offensive eyes of civilized Europeans.    But in thus becoming directed only against sight, and not against action,  the gestures of modesty are at once free to become merely those of  coquetry. When there is no real danger of offensive action, there is no  need for more than playful defence, and no serious anxiety should that  defence be taken as a disguised invitation. Thus the road is at once fully  open toward the most civilized manifestations of the comedy of courtship.    In the same way the social fear of arousing disgust combines easily and  perfectly with any new development in the invention of ornament or  clothing as sexual lures. Even among the most civilized races it has often  been noted that the fashion of feminine garments (as also sometimes the  use of scents) has the double object of concealing and attracting. It is  so with the little apron of the young savage belle. The heightening of the  attraction is, indeed, a logical outcome of the fear of evoking disgust.    It is possible, as some ethnographists have observed,[48] that intercrural  cords and other primitive garments have a physical ground, inasmuch as  they protect the most sensitive and unprotected part of the body,  especially in women. We may note in this connection the significant  remarks of K. von den Steinen, who argues that among Brazilian tribes the  object of the _uluri_, etc., is to obtain a maximum of protection for the  mucous membrane with a minimum of concealment. Among the Eskimo, as Nansen  noted, the corresponding intercrural cord is so thin as to be often  practically invisible; this may be noted, I may add, in the excellent  photographs of Eskimo women given by Holm.    But it is evident that, in the beginning, protection is to little or no  extent the motive for attaching foreign substances to the body. Thus the  tribes of Central Australia wear no clothes, although they often suffer  from the cold. But, in addition to armlets, neck-bands and head-bands,  they have string or hair girdles, with, for the women, a very small apron  and, for the men, a pubic tassel. The latter does not conceal the organs,  being no larger than a coin, and often brilliantly coated with white  pipeclay, especially during the progress of _corrobborees_, when a large  number of men and women meet together; it serves the purpose of drawing  attention to the organs.[49] When Forster visited the unspoilt islanders  of the Pacific early in the eighteenth century, he tells us that, though  they wore no clothes, they found it necessary to cover themselves with  various ornaments, especially on, the sexual parts. \"But though their  males,\" he remarks, \"were to all appearances equally anxious in this  respect with their females, this part of their dress served only to make  that more conspicuous which it intended to hide.\"[50] He adds the  significant remark that \"these ideas of decency and modesty are only  observed at the age of sexual maturity,\" just as in Central Australia  women may only wear aprons after the initiation of puberty.    \"There are certain things,\" said Montaigne, \"which are hidden in order to  be shown;\" and there can be no doubt that the contention of Westermarck  and others, that ornament and clothing were, in the first place, intended,  not to conceal or even to protect the body, but, in large part, to render  it sexually attractive, is fully proved.[51] We cannot, in the light of  all that has gone before, regard ornaments and clothing as the sole cause  of modesty, but the feelings that are thus gathered around the garment  constitute a highly important factor of modesty.        Among some Australian tribes it is said that the sexual organs      are only covered during their erotic dances; and it is further      said that in some parts of the world only prostitutes are      clothed. \"The scanty covering,\" as Westermarck observes, \"was      found to act as the most powerful obtainable sexual stimulus.\" It      is undoubtedly true that this statement may be made not merely of      the savage, but of the most civilized world. All observers agree      that the complete nudity of savages, unlike the civilized      _decollete_ or _detrousse_, has no suggestion of sexual      allurement. (Westermarck quotes numerous testimonies on this      point, op. cit., pp. 192 et seq.) Dr. R.W. Felkin remarks      concerning Central Africa, that he has never met more indecency      than in Uganda, where the penalty of death is inflicted on an      adult found naked in the street. (_Edinburgh Medical Journal_,      April, 1884.) A study of pictures or statuary will alone serve to      demonstrate that nakedness is always chaster in its effects than      partial clothing. As a well-known artist, Du Maurier, has      remarked (in _Trilby_), it is \"a fact well known to all painters      and sculptors who have used the nude model (except a few shady      pretenders, whose purity, not being of the right sort, has gone      rank from too much watching) that nothing is so chaste as nudity.      Venus herself, as she drops her garments and steps on to the      model-throne, leaves behind her on the floor every weapon in her      armory by which she can pierce to the grosser passions of men.\"      Burton, in the _Anatomy of Melancholy_ (Part III, Sect. II,      Subsect. 3), deals at length with the \"Allurements of Love,\" and      concludes that \"the greatest provocations of lust are from our      apparel.\" The artist's model, as one informs me, is much less      exposed to liberties from men when nude than when she is      partially clothed, and it may be noted that in Paris studios the      model who poses naked undresses behind a screen.        An admirable poetic rendering of this element in the philosophy      of clothing has been given by Herrick, that master of erotic      psychology, in \"A Lily in Crystal,\" where he argues that a lily      in crystal, and amber in a stream, and strawberries in cream,      gain an added delight from semi-concealment; and so, he      concludes, we obtain            \"A rule, how far, to teach,          Your nakedness must reach.\"        In this connection, also, it is worth noting that Stanley Hall,      in a report based on returns from nearly a thousand persons,      mostly teachers, (\"The Early Sense of Self,\" _American Journal of      Psychology_, 1898, p. 366), finds that of the three functions of      clothes--protection, ornament, and Lotzean \"self-feeling\"--the      second is by far the most conspicuous in childhood. The attitude      of children is testimony to the primitive attitude toward      clothing.        It cannot, however, be said that the use of clothing for the sake      of showing the natural forms of the body has everywhere been      developed. In Japan, where nakedness is accepted without shame,      clothes are worn to cover and conceal, and not to reveal, the      body. It is so, also, in China. A distinguished Chinese      gentleman, who had long resided in Europe, once told Baelz that      he had gradually learnt to grasp the European point of view, but      that it would be impossible to persuade his fellow-countrymen      that a woman who used her clothes to show off her figure could      possibly possess the least trace of modesty. (Baelz, _Zeitschrift      fuer Ethnologie_, 1901, Heft 2, p. 179.)    The great artistic elaboration often displayed by articles of ornament or  clothing, even when very small, and the fact--as shown by Karl von den  Steinen regarding the Brazilian _uluri_--that they may serve as common  motives in general decoration, sufficiently prove that such objects  attract rather than avoid attention. And while there is an invincible  repugnance among some peoples to remove these articles, such repugnance  being often strongest when the adornment is most minute, others have no  such repugnance or are quite indifferent whether or not their aprons are  accurately adjusted. The mere presence or possession of the article gives  the required sense of self-respect, of human dignity, of sexual  desirability. Thus it is that to unclothe a person, is to humiliate him;  this was so even in Homeric times, for we may recall the threat of  Ulysses to strip Thyestes.[52]    When clothing is once established, another element, this time a  social-economic element, often comes in to emphasize its importance and  increase the anatomical modesty of women. I mean the growth of the  conception of women as property. Waitz, followed by Schurtz and  Letourneau, has insisted that the jealousy of husbands is the primary  origin of clothing, and, indirectly, of modesty. Diderot in the eighteenth  century had already given clear expression to the same view. It is  undoubtedly true that only married women are among some peoples clothed,  the unmarried women, though full grown, remaining naked. In many parts of  the world, also, as Mantegazza and others have shown, where the men are  naked and the women covered, clothing is regarded as a sort of disgrace,  and men can only with difficulty be persuaded to adopt it. Before marriage  a woman was often free, and not bound to chastity, and at the same time  was often naked; after marriage she was clothed, and no longer free. To  the husband's mind, the garment appears--illogically, though naturally--a  moral and physical protection against any attack on his property.[53] Thus  a new motive was furnished, this time somewhat artificially, for making  nakedness, in women at all events, disgraceful. As the conception of  property also extended to the father's right over his daughters, and the  appreciation of female chastity developed,"]]]
