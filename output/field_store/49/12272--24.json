Afterwards, Paul appears to have travelled much in Asia Minor and in  Greece, telling the slaves that they were all children of one loving  Father and that happiness awaits all, both rich and poor, who have tried  to live honest lives and have done good to those who were suffering and  miserable.    I hope that I have answered your questions to your satisfaction. The  whole story seems very harmless to me as far as the safety of the state  is concerned. But then, we Romans never have been able to understand the  people of this province. I am sorry that they have killed your friend  Paul. I wish that I were at home again, and I am, as ever,                             Your dutiful nephew,                                     GLADIUS ENSA.          THE FALL OF ROME    THE TWILIGHT OF ROME      THE text-books of ancient History give the date 476 as the year in which  Rome fell, because in that year the last emperor was driven off his  throne. But Rome, which was not built in a day, took a long time  falling. The process was so slow and so gradual that most Romans did not  realise how their old world was coming to an end. They complained about  the unrest of the times--they grumbled about the high prices of food and  about the low wages of the workmen--they cursed the profiteers who had a  monopoly of the grain and the wool and the gold coin. Occasionally they  rebelled against an unusually rapacious governor. But the majority of  the people during the first four centuries of our era ate and drank  (whatever their purse allowed them to buy) and hated or loved (according  to their nature) and went to the theatre (whenever there was a free  show of fighting gladiators) or starved in the slums of the big  cities, utterly ignorant of the fact that their empire had outlived its  usefulness and was doomed to perish.    How could they realise the threatened danger? Rome made a fine showing  of outward glory. Well-paved roads connected the different provinces,  the imperial police were active and showed little tenderness for  highwaymen. The frontier was closely guarded against the savage tribes  who seemed to be occupying the waste lands of northern Europe. The whole  world was paying tribute to the mighty city of Rome, and a score of  able men were working day and night to undo the mistakes of the past and  bring about a return to the happier conditions of the early Republic.    But the underlying causes of the decay of the State, of which I have  told you in a former chapter, had not been removed and reform therefore  was impossible.    Rome was, first and last and all the time, a city-state as Athens and  Corinth had been city-states in ancient Hellas. It had been able to  dominate the Italian peninsula. But Rome as the ruler of the entire  civilised world was a political impossibility and could not endure. Her  young men were killed in her endless wars. Her farmers were ruined by  long military service and by taxation. They either became professional  beggars or hired themselves out to rich landowners who gave them board  and lodging in exchange for their services and made them \"serfs,\" those  unfortunate human beings who are neither slaves nor freemen, but who  have become part of the soil upon which they work, like so many cows,  and the trees.    The Empire, the State, had become everything. The common citizen had  dwindled down to less than nothing. As for the slaves, they had heard  the words that were spoken by Paul. They had accepted the message of the  humble carpenter of Nazareth. They did not rebel against their masters.  On the contrary, they had been taught to be meek and they obeyed their  superiors. But they had lost all interest in the affairs of this world  which had proved such a miserable place of abode. They were willing to  fight the good fight that they might enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.  But they were not willing to engage in warfare for the benefit of an  ambitious emperor who aspired to glory by way of a foreign campaign in  the land of the Parthians or the Numidians or the Scots.    And so conditions grew worse as the centuries went by. The first  Emperors had continued the tradition of \"leadership\" which had given the  old tribal chieftains such a hold upon their subjects. But the Emperors  of the second and third centuries were Barrack-Emperors, professional  soldiers, who existed by the grace of their body-guards, the so-called  Praetorians. They succeeded each other with terrifying rapidity,  murdering their way into the palace and being murdered out of it as soon  as their successors had become rich enough to bribe the guards into a  new rebellion.    Meanwhile the barbarians were hammering at the gates of the northern  frontier. As there were no longer any native Roman armies to stop their  progress, foreign mercenaries had to be hired to fight the invader. As  the foreign soldier happened to be of the same blood as his supposed  enemy, he was apt to be quite lenient when he engaged in battle.  Finally, by way of experiment, a few tribes were allowed to settle  within the confines of the Empire. Others followed. Soon these tribes  complained bitterly of the greedy Roman tax-gatherers, who took away  their last penny. When they got no redress they marched to Rome and  loudly demanded that they be heard.    This made Rome very uncomfortable as an Imperial residence. Constantine  (who ruled from 323 to 337) looked for a new capital. He chose  Byzantium, the gate-way for the commerce between Europe and Asia. The  city was renamed Constantinople, and the court moved eastward. When  Constantine died, his two sons, for the sake of a more efficient  administration, divided the Empire between them. The elder lived in  Rome and ruled in the west. The younger stayed in Constantinople and was  master of the east.    Then came the fourth century and the terrible visitation of the Huns,  those mysterious Asiatic horsemen who for more than two centuries  maintained themselves in Northern Europe and continued their career of  bloodshed until they were defeated near Chalons-sur-Marne in France in  the year 451. As soon as the Huns had reached the Danube they had begun  to press hard upon the Goths. The Goths, in order to save themselves,  were thereupon obliged to invade Rome. The Emperor Valens tried to stop  them, but was killed near Adrianople in the year 378. Twenty-two years  later, under their king, Alaric, these same West Goths marched westward  and attacked Rome. They did not plunder, and destroyed only a few  palaces. Next came the Vandals, and showed less respect for the  venerable traditions of the city. Then the Burgundians. Then the East  Goths. Then the Alemanni. Then the Franks. There was no end to the  invasions. Rome at last was at the mercy of every ambitious highway  robber who could gather a few followers.    In the year 402 the Emperor fled to Ravenna, which was a sea-port and  strongly fortified, and there, in the year 475, Odoacer, commander of a  regiment of the German mercenaries, who wanted the farms of Italy to  be divided among themselves, gently but effectively pushed Romulus  Augustulus, the last of the emperors who ruled the western division,  from his throne, and proclaimed himself Patriarch or ruler of Rome. The  eastern Emperor, who was very busy with his own affairs, recognised him,  and for ten years Odoacer ruled what was left of the western provinces.    A few years later, Theodoric, King of the East Goths, invaded the newly  formed Patriciat, took Ravenna, murdered Odoacer at his own dinner  table, and established a Gothic Kingdom amidst the ruins of the western  part of the Empire. This Patriciate state did not last long. In the  sixth century a motley crowd of Longobards and Saxons and Slavs and  Avars invaded Italy, destroyed the Gothic kingdom, and established a new  state of which Pavia became the capital.    Then at last the imperial city sank into a state of utter neglect and  despair. The ancient palaces had been plundered time and again. The  schools had been burned down. The teachers had been starved to death.  The rich people had been thrown out of their villas which were now  inhabited by evil-smelling and hairy barbarians. The roads had fallen  into decay. The old bridges were gone and commerce had come to a  standstill. Civilisation--the product of thousands of years of patient  labor on the part of Egyptians and Babylonians and Greeks and Romans,  which had lifted man high above the most daring dreams of his earliest  ancestors, threatened to perish from the western continent.    It is true that in the far east, Constantinople continued to be the  centre of an Empire for another thousand years. But it hardly counted  as a part of the European continent. Its interests lay in the east. It  began to forget its western origin. Gradually the Roman language was  given up for the Greek. The Roman alphabet was discarded and Roman  law was written in Greek characters and explained by Greek judges. The  Emperor became an Asiatic despot, worshipped as the god-like kings of  Thebes had been worshipped in the valley of the Nile, three thousand  years before. When missionaries of the Byzantine church looked for fresh  fields of activity, they went eastward and carried the civilisation of  Byzantium into the vast wilderness of Russia.    As for the west, it was left to the mercies of the Barbarians. For  twelve generations, murder, war, arson, plundering were the order of  the day. One thing--and one thing alone--saved Europe from complete  destruction, from a return to the days of cave-men and the hyena.    This was the church--the flock of humble men and women who for many  centuries had confessed themselves the followers of Jesus, the carpenter  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#18)"],[1,". 'Yes can I, sure!'    'How's Mrs. Fibbitson today?' said the Master, looking at another old  woman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of clothes  that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by  mistake.    'Ah, she's poorly,' said the first old woman. 'It's one of her bad days.  If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe she'd  go out too, and never come to life again.'    As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm day,  she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous  even of the saucepan on it; and I have reason to know that she took its  impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in  dudgeon; for I saw her, with my own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at  me once, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else  was looking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with  her own back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the  fire as if she were sedulously keeping IT warm, instead of it keeping  her warm, and watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion  of the preparations for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her  such extreme joy that she laughed aloud--and a very unmelodious laugh  she had, I must say.    I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a  basin of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While I was yet  in the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the  Master:    'Have you got your flute with you?'    'Yes,' he returned.    'Have a blow at it,' said the old woman, coaxingly. 'Do!'    The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat,  and brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together,  and began immediately to play. My impression is, after many years of  consideration, that there never can have been anybody in the world who  played worse. He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced  by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the tunes  were--if there were such things in the performance at all, which I  doubt--but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me  think of all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to  take away my appetite; and lastly, to make me so sleepy that I couldn't  keep my eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin to nod, as the  recollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little room, with its  open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular  little staircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's  feathers displayed over the mantelpiece--I remember wondering when I  first went in, what that peacock would have thought if he had known what  his finery was doomed to come to--fades from before me, and I nod, and  sleep. The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard  instead, and I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with a start,  and the flute has come back again, and the Master at Salem House is  sitting with his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman  of the house looks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and he fades,  and all fades, and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem House, no  David Copperfield, no anything but heavy sleep.    I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal  flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him  in her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave  him an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing  for a moment. I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking,  either then or immediately afterwards; for, as he resumed--it was a real  fact that he had stopped playing--I saw and heard the same old woman ask  Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs.  Fibbitson replied, 'Ay, ay! yes!' and nodded at the fire: to which, I am  persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.    When I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem  House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before,  and took me away. We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon the  roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to take  up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers, and  where I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace up  a steep hill among green leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come to  its destination.    A short walk brought us--I mean the Master and me--to Salem House, which  was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull. Over a door  in this wall was a board with SALEM HOUSE upon it; and through a grating  in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face,  which I found, on the door being opened, belonged to a stout man with a  bull-neck, a wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut close all  round his head.    'The new boy,' said the Master.    The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over--it didn't take long, for  there was not much of me--and locked the gate behind us, and took out  the key. We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy trees,  when he called after my conductor. 'Hallo!'    We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where  he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.    'Here! The cobbler's been,' he said, 'since you've been out, Mr. Mell,  and he says he can't mend 'em any more. He says there ain't a bit of the  original boot left, and he wonders you expect it.'    With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back a  few paces to pick them up, and looked at them (very disconsolately,  I was afraid), as we went on together. I observed then, for the first  time, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear, and  that his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud.    Salem House was a square brick building with wings; of a bare and  unfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said to  Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out; but he seemed surprised at my  not knowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were at their  several homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down by the  sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle; and that I was sent in holiday-time  as a punishment for my misdoing, all of which he explained to me as we  went along.    I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most forlorn  and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room with three  long rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling all round with pegs  for hats and slates. Scraps of old copy-books and exercises litter the  dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made of the same materials, are  scattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind  by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of  pasteboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes  for anything to eat. A bird, in a cage very little bigger than himself,  makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches  high, or dropping from it; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a  strange unwholesome smell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet  apples wanting air, and rotten books. There could not well be more ink  splashed about it, if it had been roofless from its first construction,  and the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the  varying seasons of the year.    Mr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs, I  went softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept  along. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written,  which was lying on the desk, and bore these words: 'TAKE CARE OF HIM. HE  BITES.'    I got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog  underneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could  see nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell  came back, and asked me what I did up there?    'I beg your pardon, sir,' says I, 'if you please, I'm looking for the  dog.'    'Dog?' he says. 'What dog?'    'Isn't it a dog, sir?'    'Isn't what a dog?'    'That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites.'    'No, Copperfield,' says he, gravely, 'that's not a dog. That's a boy.  My instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am  sorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it.' With that he  took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly constructed for  the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and wherever I went,  afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it.    What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether it was  possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that somebody was  reading it. It was no relief to turn round and find nobody; for wherever  my back was, there I imagined somebody always to be. That cruel man with  the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings. He was in authority; and if he  ever saw me leaning against a tree, or a wall, or the house, he roared  out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice, 'Hallo, you sir! You  Copperfield! Show that badge conspicuous, or I'll report you!' The  playground was a bare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house  and the offices; and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher  read it, and the baker read it; that everybody, in a word, who came  backwards and forwards to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to  walk there, read that I was to be taken care of, for I bit, I recollect  that I positively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy  who did bite.    There was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had a  custom of carving their names. It was completely covered with such  inscriptions. "]]]
