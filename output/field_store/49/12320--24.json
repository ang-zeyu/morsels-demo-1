And he made an end [of them, and there  were no more of the fiends] of Set in this place at [that] moment.        [FN#88]  \"Sebiu\" is a common name for the associates of Seti, and this  fiend is himself called \"Seba,\" a word which means something like  \"rebel.\"          XVII.  And Thoth said, \"This place shall be called Ast-Ab-Heru\"[FN#89]  because Heru-Behutet wrought his desire upon them (i.e., the enemy);  and he passed six days and six nights coming into port on the waters  thereof and did not see one of them.  And he saw them fall down in the  watery depths, and he made ready the place of Ast-ab-Heru there.  It  was situated on the bank of the water, and the face (i.e., direction)  thereof was full-front towards the South.  And all the rites and  ceremonies of Heru-Behutet were performed on the first day of the first  month[FN#90] of the season Akhet, and on the first day of the first  month[FN#91] of the season Pert, and on the twenty-first and twenty-  fourth days of the second month[FN#92] of the season Pert.  These are  the festivals in the town of Ast-ab, by the side of the South, in An-  rut-f.[FN#93]  And he came into port and went against them, keeping  watch as for a king over the Great God in An-rut-f, in this place, in  order to drive away the Enemy and his Smaiu fiends at his coming by  night from the region of Mertet, to the west of this place.

[FN#93]  A mythological locality originally placed near Herakleopolis.  The name means \"the place where nothing grows.\"  Several forms of the  name occur in the older literature, e.g. in the Theban Recension of the  Book of the Dead.        And Heru-Behutet was in the form of a man who possessed great strength,  with the face of a hawk; and he was crowned with the White  Crown,[FN#94] and the Red Crown,[FN#95] and the two plumes, and the  Urerit Crown, and there were two uraei upon his head.  His hand grasped  firmly his harpoon to slay the hippopotamus, which was [as hard] as the  khenem[FN#96] stone in its mountain bed.        [FN#94]  The Crown of the South.    [FN#95]  The Crown of the North.    [FN#96]  A kind of jasper (?).          And Ra said unto Thoth, \"Indeed [Heru-]Behutet is like a Master-fighter  in the slaughter of his enemies . . . . . .\"      And Thoth said unto Ra, \"He shall be called 'Neb-Ahau'\" (i.e., Master-  fighter); and for this reason he hath been thus called by the priest of  this god unto this day.      And Isis made incantations of every kind in order to drive away the  fiend Ra from An-rut-f, and from the Great God in this place.  And  Thoth said [unto Ra], \"The priestess of this god shall be called by the  name of 'Nebt-Heka' for this reason.\"    And Thoth said unto Ra, \"Beautiful, beautiful is this place wherein  thou hast taken up thy seat, keeping watch, as for a king, over the  Great God who is in An-rut-f[FN#97] in peace.\"        [FN#97]  i.e., Osiris.            And Thoth said, \"This Great House in this place shall therefore be  called 'Ast-Nefert'[FN#98] from this day. It is situated to the  south-west of the city of Nart, and [covereth] a space of four  schoinoi.\"  And Ra Heru-Behutet said unto Thoth, \"Hast thou not  searched through this water for the enemy?\"  And Thoth said, \"The water  of the God-house in this place shall be called by the name of 'Heh'  (i.e., sought out).\"  And Ra said, \"Thy ship, O Heru-Behutet, is great  (?) upon Ant-mer (?) . . . . . .  And Thoth said, \"The name of [thy  ship] shall be called 'Ur', and this stream shall be called 'Ant-mer  (?).'\"  As concerning (or, now) the place Ab-Bat (?) is situated on the  shore of the water.  \"Ast-nefert\" is the name of the Great house, \"Neb-  Aha\" [is the name of] the priest . . . . . . . . is the name of the  priestess, \"Heh\" is the name of the lake . . . . . . .

[FN#98]  i.e., \"Beautiful Place.\"    [FN#99]  Or perhaps fighting men who were armed with metal weapons.          [And when he had reached the land of the North with his followers, he  found the enemy.]  Now as for the blacksmiths who were over the middle  regions, they made a great slaughter of the enemy, and there were  brought back one hundred and six of them.  Now as for the blacksmiths  of the West, they brought back one hundred and six of the enemy.  Now  as for the blacksmiths of the East, among whom was Heru-Behutet, he  slew them (i.e., the enemy) in the presence of Ra in the Middle  Domains.[FN#100]        [FN#100]  In the sculptures (Naville, Mythe, pl. 17) Heru-Behutet is  seen standing in a boat spearing a crocodile, and immediately behind d  him in the boat is Ra-Harmachis in his shrine.  The Mesentiu of the  West are represented by an armed warrior in a boat, who is spearing a  crocodile, and leads the way for Heru-Behutet.  In a boat behind the  great god is a representative of the Mesentiu of the East spearing a  crocodile.          And Ra, said unto Thoth, \"My heart [is satisfied] with the works of  these blacksmiths of Heru-Behutet who are in his bodyguard.  They shall  dwell in sanctuaries, and libations and purifications and offerings  shall be made to their images, and [there shall be appointed for them]  priests who shall minister by the month, and priests who shall minister  by the hour, in all their God-houses whatsoever, as their reward  because they have slain the enemies of the god.\"      And Thoth said, \"The [Middle] Domains shall be called after the names  of these blacksmiths from this day onwards, and the god who dwelleth  among them, Heru-Behutet, shall be called the 'Lord of Mesent' from  this day onwards, and the domain shall be called 'Mesent of the West'  from this day onwards.\"      As concerning Mesent of the West, the face (or, front) thereof shall be  towards [the East], towards the place where Ra riseth, and this Mesent  shall be called \"Mesent of the East\" from this day onwards.  As  concerning the double town of Mesent, the work of these blacksmiths of  the East, the face (or, front) thereof shall be towards the South,  towards the city of Behutet, the hiding-place of Heru-Behutet.  And  there shall be performed therein all the rites and ceremonies of Heru-  Behutet on the second day of the first month[FN#101] of the season of  Akhet, and on the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month[FN#102] of the  season of Akhet, and on the seventh day of the first month[FN#103] of  the season Pert, and on the twenty-first day of the second  month[FN#104] of the season Pert, from this day onwards.  Their stream  shall be called \"Asti,\" the name of their Great House shall be called  \"Abet,\" the [priest (?)] shall be called \"Qen-aha,\" and their domain  shall be called \"Kau-Mesent\" from this day onwards.

And Ra said unto Heru-Behutet, \"These enemies have sailed up  the river, to the country of Setet, to the end of the pillar-house of  Hat, and they have sailed up the river to the east, to the country or  Tchalt (or, Tchart),[FN#105] which is their region of swamps.\"  And  Heru-Behutet said, \"Everything which thou hast commanded hath come to  pass, Ra, Lord of the Gods; thou art the lord of commands.\"  And they  untied the Boat of Ra, and they sailed up the river to the east.  Then  he looked upon those enemies whereof some of them had fallen into the  sea (or, river), and the others had fallen headlong on the mountains.        [FN#105]  Zoan-Tanis.          And Heru-Behutet transformed himself into a lion which had the face of  a man, and which was crowned with the triple crown.[FN#106]  His paw  was like unto a flint knife, and he went round and round by the side of  them, and brought back one hundred and forty-two [of the enemy], and be  rent them in pieces with his claws.  He tore out their tongues, and  their blood flowed on the ridges of the land in this place; and he made  them the property of those who were in his following [whilst] he was  upon the mountains.        [FN#106]  In the sculpture (Naville, Mythe, pl. 18), we see a  representation of this lion, which is standing over the bodies of slain  enemies upon a rectangular pedestal, or block.          And Ra said unto Thoth, \"Behold, Heru-Behutet is like unto a lion in  his lair [when] he is on the back of the enemy who have given unto him  their tongues.\"      And Thoth said, \"This domain shall be called 'Khent-abt,' and it shall  [also] be called 'Tchalt' (or, Tchart) from this day onwards.  And the  bringing of the tongues from the remote places of Tchalt (or, Tchart)  [shall be commemorated] from this day onwards.  And this god shall be  called 'Heru-Behutet, Lord of Mesent,' from this day onwards.\"        And Ra said unto Heru-Behutet, \"Let us sail to the south up the river,  and let us smite the enemies [who are] in the forms of crocodiles and  hippopotami in the face of Egypt.\"        And Heru-Behutet said, \"Thy divine Ka, O Ra, Lord of the gods!  Let us  sail up the river against the remainder--one third--of the enemies who  are in the water (or, river).\"  Then Thoth recited the Chapters of  protecting the Boat [of Ra] and the boats of the blacksmiths, [which he  used] for making tranquil the sea at the moment when a storm was raging  on it.    And Ra said unto Thoth, \"Have we not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#18)"],[1,"75] involuntarily to forward my views. I therefore began to act at  his house with all the petulance of an Osmanly. It being the Ramadhan, I  fasted during the day, and at night demanded a supper apart; early on  the following morning I called for an abundant breakfast, before the  fast recommenced. I appropriated to myself the best room which his small  house afforded; and his servants were kept in constant attendance upon  me. Eastern hospitality forbids all resentment for such behaviour; I  was, besides, a great man, and on a visit to the Pasha. In my  conversations with Bosari, I assured him that I felt myself most  comfortably situated at Tayf, and that its climate agreed perfectly with  my health; and I betrayed no desire of quitting the place for the  present. To maintain a person in my character for any length of time at  Tayf, where provisions of all kinds were much dearer than in London, was  a matter of no small moment; and a petulant guest is everywhere  disagreeable. The design, I believe, succeeded perfectly; and Bosari  endeavoured to persuade the Pasha that I was a harmless being, in order  that I might be the sooner dismissed.    I had been six days at Tayf, but seldom went out, except to the castle  in the evening, when Bosari asked whether my business with the Pasha was  likely to prevent me much longer from pursuing my travels, and visiting  Mekka. I replied that I had no business with the Pasha, though I had  come to Tayf at his desire; but that my situation was very agreeable to  me, possessing so warm and generous a friend as he, my host. The next  day he renewed the subject, and remarked that it must be tiresome to  live entirely among soldiers, without any comforts or amusements,  unacquainted besides, as I was, with the Turkish language. I assented to  this; but added, that being ignorant of the Pashas wishes, I could  determine on nothing. This brought him to the point I wished. This  being the case, said he, I will, if you like, speak to his Highness on  the subject. He did so in the evening, before I went to the castle; and  the Pasha told me, in the course of conversation,    [p.76] that as he understood I wished to pass the last days of Ramadhan  at Mekka, (a suggestion originating with Bosari,) I had better join the  party of the Kadhy, who was going there to the feast, and who would be  very glad of my company. This was precisely such a circumstance as I  wished for. The departure of the Kadhy was fixed for the 7th of  September, and I hired two asses, the usual mode of conveyance in this  country, in order to follow him.    As it was my intention to proceed afterwards to Medina, where Tousoun  Pasha, the son of Mohammed Aly, was governor, I begged Bosari to ask the  Pasha for a firman or passport, authorising me to travel through all the  Hedjaz, together with a letter of recommendation to his son. In reply,  Bosari told me that the Pasha did not like to interfere personally in my  travels; that I might act as I pleased, on my own responsibility; and  that my knowledge of the language rendered a passport unnecessary. This  was equivalent to telling me, Do what you please; I shall neither  obstruct nor facilitate your projects, which, indeed, was as much, at  present, as I could well expect or desire.    On the 6th of September I took my leave of the Pasha, who told me at  parting, that if ever my travels should carry me to India, I might  assure the English people there that he was much attached to the  interests of the India trade. Early on the 7th the Kadhy sent me word  that he should not set out till evening, would travel during the night,  and hoped to meet me at Djebel Kora, midway to Mekka. I therefore left  Tayf alone, as I had entered it, after a residence of ten days. At  parting, Bosari assured me of his inviolable attachment to my interest;  and I blessed my good stars, when I left the precincts of the town, and  the residence of a Turkish court, in which I found it more difficult to  avoid danger, than among the wild Bedouins of Nubia.    During my stay at Tayf, I had five or six interviews with the    [p.77] Pasha; and the following extracts from my journal will show the  general result of what passed between us on those different occasions:--    Q. Sheikh Ibrahim, I hope you are well.  A. Perfectly well, and most happy to have the honour of seeing you  again.  Q. You have travelled much since I saw you at Cairo. How far did you  advance into the negro country?    To this question I replied, by giving a short account of my journey in  Nubia.    Q. Tell me, how are the Mamelouks at Dongola?    I related what the reader will find in my Nubian Travels.    Q. I understand that you treated with two of the Mamelouk Beys at Ibrim;  was it so?    The word treated (if the dragoman rightly translated the Turkish word),  startled me very much; for the Pasha, while he was in Egypt, had heard  that, on my journey towards Dongola, I had met two Mamelouk Beys at  Derr; and as he still suspected that the English secretly favoured the  Mamelouk interest, he probably thought that I had been the bearer of  some message to them from government. I therefore assured him that my  meeting with the two Beys was quite accidental that the unpleasant  reception which I experienced at Mahass was on their account; and that I  entertained fears of their designs against my life. With this  explanation the Pasha seemed satisfied.    Q. Let us only settle matters here with the Wahabys, and I shall soon be  able to get rid of the Mamelouks. How many soldiers do you think are  necessary for subduing the country as far as Senaar?  A. Five hundred men, good troops, might reach that point, but could not  keep possession of the country; and the expenses would scarcely be  repaid by the booty.  Q. What do those countries afford?    [p.78]  A. Camels and slaves; and, towards Senaar, gold, brought from Abyssinia;  but all this is the property of individuals. The chiefs or kings in  those countries do not possess any riches.  Q. In what state are the roads from Egypt to Senaar?  A. I described the road between Asouan and Shendy, and from Souakin to  the same place.  Q. How did you pass your time among the Blacks?  A. I related some laughable stories, with which he seemed greatly  amused.  Q. And now, Sheikh Ibrahim, where do you mean to go?  A. I wish to perform the Hadj, return to Cairo, and then proceed to  visit Persia.--(I did not think it advisable to mention my design of  returning into the interior of Africa.)  Q. May God render the way smooth before you! but I think it folly and  madness to travel so much. What, let me ask, is the result of your last  journey?  A. Mens lives are predestined; we all obey our fate. For myself, I  enjoy great pleasure in exploring new and unknown countries, and  becoming acquainted with different races of people. I am induced to  undertake journies by the private satisfaction that travelling affords,  and I care little about personal fatigue.  Q. Have you heard of the news from Europe?  A. Only some vague reports at Djidda.    The Pasha then gave me an account of the events which ended in  Bonapartes banishment to Elba, after the entrance of the allies into  Paris. Bonaparte, he said, behaved like a coward; he ought to have  sought for death, rather than expose himself in a cage to the laughter  of the universe. The Europeans, he said, are as treacherous as the  Osmanlys; all Bonapartes confidants abandoned him--all his generals, who  owed to him their fortunes.    He was eager in his inquiries about the political relations between  Great Britain and Russia, and whether it was not likely that war might  break out between them, on account of the hostile    [p.79] intentions of the latter towards the Porte. (On this point he had  received false intelligence.) His only fear seemed to be that the  English army, which had been employed in the south of France, and in  Spain, would now be at liberty to invade Egypt. The great fish swallow  the small, he said; and Egypt is necessary to England, in supplying  corn to Malta and Gibraltar. I reasoned with him in vain on this  subject, and perceived that the dragoman did not always interpret my  answers correctly, from the fear of contradicting the well-known  opinions of his master. These opinions, indeed, were deeply rooted, and  had been fostered by the French mission in Egypt. I am the friend of  the English, he continued. (This addressed by a Turk to a Christian,  means only that he fears him, or wants his money.) But to tell you the  truth, among great men we see many compliments, and very little  sincerity. My hope is, that they will not fall upon Egypt during my stay  in the Hedjaz; if I am there myself, I shall at least have the  satisfaction of fighting personally for my dominions. Of the Sultan I am  not afraid, (this he repeatedly asserted, but I much doubt his  sincerity,) and I shall know how to outwit him in all his measures. An  army from Syria can never attack Egypt by land in very large bodies,  from the want of camels; and separate corps are easily destroyed as soon  as they have passed the desert.    I took the liberty of telling him that he was like a young man in  possession of a beautiful girl; although sure of her affection, he would  always be jealous of every stranger. You say well, he replied. I  certainly love Egypt with all the ardour of a lover; and if I had ten  thousand souls, I would willingly sacrifice them for its possession.    He asked me in what state I had found Upper Egypt; and whether his son  Ibrahim Pasha (the governor) was liked there. I replied, in the language  of truth, that all the chiefs of villages hated him (for he had  compelled them to abandon their despotic treatment of their fellow-  peasants); but that the peasants themselves    [p.80] were much attached to him. (The fact is, that instead of being  oppressed, as formerly, by the Mamelouk Beys and"]]]
