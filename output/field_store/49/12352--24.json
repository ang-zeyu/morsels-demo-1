I don't want to  tell you or go into the history of that incident. Probably most of you  know. I simply want to invite your attention to the fact. I don't say  they have settled up their differences. I hope they have but I do know  that they undertook to forget the differences. They undertook not to  worry the President, they undertook not to make any demonstration here  or in the Subjects Committee. All honour to those who listened to  that advice.    I only wanted my Bengali friends and all the other friends who have come  to this great assembly with a fixed determination to seek nothing but  the settlement of their country, to seek nothing but the advancement of  their respective rights, to seek nothing but the conservation of the  national honour. I appeal to every one of you to copy the example set by  those who felt aggrieved and who felt that their heads were broken. I  know, before we have done with this great battle on which we have  embarked at the special sessions of the Congress, we have to go  probably, possibly through a sea of blood, but let it not be said of us  or any one of us that we are guilty of shedding blood, but let it be  said by generations yet to be born that we suffered, that we shed not  somebody's blood but our own, and so I have no hesitation in saying that  I do not want to show much sympathy for those who had their heads  broken or who were said to be even in danger of losing their lives. What  does it matter? It is much better to die at the hands, at least, of our  own countrymen. What is there to revenge ourselves about or upon. So I  ask everyone of you that if at any time there is blood-boiling within  you against some fellow countrymen of yours, even though he may be in  the employ of Government, though he may be in the Secret Service, you  will take care not to be offended and not to return blow for blow.  Understand that the very moment you return the blow from the detective,  your cause is lost. This is your non-violent campaign. And so I ask  everyone of you not to retaliate but to bottle up all your rage, to  dismiss your rage from you and you will rise graver men. I am here to  congratulate those who have restrained themselves from going to the  President and bringing the dispute before him.    Therefore I appeal to those who feel aggrieved to feel that they have  done the right thing in forgetting it and if they have not forgotten I  ask them to try to forget the thing; and that is the object lesson to  which I wanted to draw your attention if you want to carry this  resolution. Do not carry this resolution only by an acclamation for this  resolution, but I want you to accompany the carrying out of this  resolution with a faith and resolve which nothing on earth can move.  That you are intent upon getting Swaraj at the earliest possible moment  and that you are intent upon getting Swaraj by means that are  legitimate, that are honourable and by means that are non-violent, that  are peaceful, you have resolved upon, so far you can say to-day. We  cannot give battle to this Government by means of steel, but we can give  battle by exercising, what I have so often called, \"soul force\" and soul  force is not the prerogative of one man of a Sanyasi or even a so-called  saint. Soul force is the prerogative of every human being, female or  male and therefore I ask my countrymen, if they want to accept this  resolution, to accept it with that firm determination and to understand  that it is inaugurated under such good and favourable auspices as I have  described to you.    In my humble opinion, the Congress will have done the rightest thing, if  it unanimously adopts this resolution. May God grant that you will pass  this resolution unanimously, may God grant that you will also have the  courage and the ability to carry out the resolution and that within one  year.          V. HINDU MOSLEM UNITY      [A dialogue between Editor and reader on the Hindu-Moslem Unity--_Indian  Home Rule_.]      THE HINDUS AND THE MAHOMEDANS.    EDITOR: Your last question is a serious one, and yet, on careful  consideration, it will be found to be easy of solution. The question  arises because of the presence of the railways of the lawyers, and of  the doctors. We shall presently examine the last two. We have already  considered the railways. I should, however, like to add that man is so  made by nature as to require him to restrict his movements as far as his  hands and feet will take him. If we did not rush about from place to  place by means of railways such other maddening conveniences, much of  the confusion that arises would be obviated. Our difficulties are of our  own creation. God set a limit to a man's locomotive ambition in the  construction of his body. Man immediately proceeded to discover means of  overriding the limit. God gifted man with intellect that he might know  his Maker. Man abused it, so that he might forget his Maker. I am so  constructed that I can only serve my immediate neighbours, but, in my  conceit, I pretend to have discovered that I must with my body serve  every individual in the Universe. In thus attempting the impossible, man  comes in contact with different natures, different religions, and is  utterly confounded. According to this reasoning, it must be apparent to  you that railways are a most dangerous institution. Man has therefore  gone further away from his Maker.    READER: But I am impatient to hear your answer to my question. Has the  introduction of Mahomedanism not unmade the nation?    EDITOR: India cannot cease to be one nation because people belonging to  different religions live in it. The introduction of foreigners does not  necessarily destroy the nation, they merge in it. A country is one  nation only when such a condition obtains in it. That country must have  a faculty for assimilation. India has ever been such a country. In  reality, there are as many religions as there are individuals, but those  who are conscious of the spirit of nationality do not interfere with one  another's religion. If they do, they are not fit to be considered a  nation. If the Hindus believe that India should be peopled only by  Hindus, they are living in dreamland. The Hindus, the Mahomedans, the  Parsees and the Christians who have made India their country are fellow  countrymen, and they will have to live in unity if only for their own  interest. In no part of the world are one nationality and one religion  synonymous terms: nor has it ever been so in India.    READER: But what about the inborn enmity between Hindus and Mahomedans?    EDITOR: That phrase has been invented by our mutual enemy. When the  Hindus and Mahomedans fought against one another, they certainly spoke  in that strain. They have long since ceased to fight. How, then, can  there be any inborn enmity? Pray remember this, too, that we did not  cease to fight only after British occupation. The Hindus flourished  under Moslem sovereigns, and Moslems under the Hindu. Each party  recognised that mutual fighting was suicidal, and that neither party  would abandon its religion by force of arms. Both parties, therefore,  decided to live in peace. With the English advent the quarrels  recommenced.    The proverbs you have quoted were coined when both were fighting; to  quote them now is obviously harmful. Should we not remember that many  Hindus and Mahomedans own the same ancestors, and the same blood runs  through their veins? Do people become enemies because they change their  religion? Is the God of the Mahomedan different from the God of the  Hindu? Religions are different roads converging to the same point. What  does it matter that we take different roads, so long as we reach the  same goal? Wherein is the cause for quarrelling?    Moreover, there are deadly proverbs as between the followers of Shiva  and those of Vishnu, yet nobody suggests that these two do not belong to  the same nation. It is said that the Vedic religion is different from  Jainism, but the followers of the respective faiths are not different  nations. The fact is that we have become enslaved, and, therefore,  quarrel and like to have our quarrels decided by a third party. There  are Hindu iconoclasts as there are Mahomedan. The more we advance in  true knowledge, the better we shall understand that we need not be at  war with those whose religion we may not follow.    READER: Now I would like to know your views about cow protection.    EDITOR: I myself respect the cow, that is, I look upon her with  affectionate reverence. The cow is the protector of India, because, it  being an agricultural country, is dependent on the cow's progeny. She is  a most useful animal in hundreds of ways. Our Mahomedan brethren will  admit this.    But, just as I respect the cow so do I respect my fellow-men. A man is  just as useful as a cow, no matter whether he be a Mahomedan or a Hindu.  Am I, then to fight with or kill a Mahomedan in order to save a cow? In  doing so, I would become an enemy as well of the cow as of the  Mahomedan. Therefore, the only method I know of protecting the cow is  that I should approach my Mahomedan brother and urge him for the sake of  the country to join me in protecting her. If he would not listen to me,  I should let the cow go for the simple reason that the matter is beyond  my ability. If I were over full of pity for the cow, I should sacrifice  my life to save her, but not take my brother's. This, I hold, is the law  of our religion.    When men become obstinate, it is a difficult thing. If I pull one way,  my Moslem brother will pull another. If I put on a superior air, he will  return the compliment. If I bow to him gently, he will do it much, more  so, and if he does not, I shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#19)"],[1,"could not be  reached.\"      AMPLE PRECEDENTS TO BE FOLLOWED.    \"Precedents to be followed are ample. In private corporate trusts that  have been mismanaged a basis of appeal has been found only when some  favorable circumstance has brought to light conditions so shocking as to  cause those people who have possessed political power, as a matter of  self-protection, to demand a thorough reorganization and revision of  methods. The same motive has lain back of legislation for the Indian.  But the motive to political action has been less effective, for the  reason that in the past the Indians who have acted in self-protection  have either been killed or placed in confinement. All the machinery of  government has been set to work to repress rather than to provide  adequate means for justly dealing with a large population which had no  political rights.\"--Edict Magazine.             *       *       *       *       *      _This Book should be in every home_    Old Indian Legends      25 Seminole Avenue, Forest Hill, L.I., N.Y.,    August 25, 1919.    Dear Zitkala-Sa:    I thank you for your book on Indian legends. I have read them with  exquisite pleasure. Like all folk tales they mirror the child life of  the world. There is in them a note of wild, strange music.    You have translated them into our language in a way that will keep them  alive in the hearts of men. They are so young, so fresh, so full of the  odors of the virgin forest untrod by the foot of white man! The thoughts  of your people seem dipped in the colors of the rainbow, palpitant with  the play of winds, eerie with the thrill of a spirit-world unseen but  felt and feared.    Your tales of birds, beast, tree and spirit can not but hold captive the  hearts of all children. They will kindle in their young minds that  eternal wonder which creates poetry and keeps life fresh and eager. I  wish you and your little book of Indian tales all success.    I am always    Sincerely your friend,    (Signed) HELEN KELLER."]]]
