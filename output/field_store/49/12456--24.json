Others say      that the head was sent to Medina, and buried near the grave of      Fatimah.--Burton, _Pilgrimage_, ii. 40; Ockley, _History of the      Saracens_, 412, 415 note.

I do not presume to offer opinions on the nature, substance, or character,  of the Mussulmaun Faith; but confine myself to the mere relation of such  facts as I have received from the best possible authority, viz. the  religious men who are of that faith, and live in strict accordance with  the tenets they profess.    There are two sects of the Mussulmaun persuasion, as I have before  remarked, viz. the Sheahs and the Soonies. The leaders of the former are  called Emaums; and those of the latter Caliphas. The Sheahs acknowledge  Ali and his immediate descendants (eleven in number) 'the right and only  lawful Emaums', in succession, after Mahumud. The Soonies declare the  Caliphas--as Omir, Aboubuker, &c.--to be their lawful leaders after  Mahumud.    I do not find that there is any great difference in the points of faith  between the two sects; they are equally guided by the same laws and  ordinances inculcated by Mahumud in the Khoraun;--the Sheahs pursuing the  pattern of observances traced out in the life and manners of Ali and his  descendants;--and the Soonies taking their examples from the manners of  the Caliphas. There is a distinguishing method in ablutions before prayers,  and also in the manner of bowing and prostrating in their devotional  exercises;[1] this difference, however, has nothing to do with their  faith,--the subject and form of their daily prayer is one; but both sects  have extra services for particular occasions, agreeable to the instruction  of their favourite leaders. The Namaaz (daily prayer) was taught by  Mahumud to his followers, every line of which is religiously reverenced by  Mussulmauns, and cannot be altered by sectarian principles.    The Mussulmaun faith is founded on three roots; from these spring, with  the Sheahs, six branches; with the Soonies, five. The roots are as  follows:--    First.--'There is but one God, self existing; ever was, and ever will be;  in Whom is all Power, Majesty, and Dominion; by Whom all things are, and  were created. With Whom is neither partner or substance:[2] and He alone  is to be worshipped.'    Second.--'The Prophets were all true; and all their writings to be relied  on, with a true faith.'    Third.--'The resurrection of the dead is certain.'    The Sheahs' branches, or emanations, from the three roots of their faith,  are as follow:--    1st.--'Namaaz,'[3] (prayer five times daily); a necessary duty, never to  be omitted.    2nd.--'Rumzaun,'[4] (fasting) the whole thirty days of that month; a  service acceptable to God from His humble creatures.    3rd.--'The Hadje,'[5] (pilgrimage to Mecca); commanded by Mahumud, and  therefore to be obeyed.    4th.--'Zuckhaut;'[6] the fortieth portion of all worldly goods to be set  apart every year (an offering to God) for the service of the poor.    5th.--To fight in the road of God, or in His service, against the  idolaters.    6th.--To believe that the twelve Emaums were the true and lawful leaders,  after Mahumud; to follow in their path, or example, and to succour and  defend the Syaads, their descendants.    The Soonies omit the last branch in their profession of faith; with this  solitary exception, the creed of the two sects, from all I can understand,  is the same. The Sheahs are those who celebrate Mahurrum: in my  description of that event will be seen the zealous partizans of the sect;  and here may be introduced with propriety, some account of the opposite  party denominated Soonies.    The word Calipha[7] implies the master or head of any trade, profession,  or calling,--as the master of the tailors, the head master of a college or  school, &c. Omir was the first to usurp the title after Mahumud's death,  and to him succeeded Aboubuker, and then Ausmaun (Osman).[8]    Aboubuker may have claimed some relationship to Mahumud;--he was converted  by his preaching from idolatry to the faith;--he gave his daughter in  marriage to Mahumud, by whom two sons were born to him, Ishmael and  Ibrahim.[9] 'An angel appeared to Mahumud, saying, Which of thy family  shall be taken from thee, Oh, Mahumud! such is the command of God; two of  thy youth must die, and I am sent to demand of thee whether it is thy wish  Ishmael and Ibrahim, thine own sons, shall be taken from this world, or  Hasan and Hosein, the sons of Fatima thy daughter?' The historian  continues, after dwelling much on the virtues of the Prophet's only  daughter, 'Such was the affection of Mahumud for his daughter Fatima and  her children, and so well he knew the purity of their hearts, that he  hesitated not a moment in replying, \"If the Lord graciously permits His  servant to choose, I freely offer my two sons Ishmael and Ibrahim; that  Hasan and Hosein may live by His mercy \"'.    Omir was also a convert to the faith Mahumud taught: he likewise gave a  daughter in marriage to Mahumud;[10] by whom, however, the same historian  remarks, his house was not peopled. His only daughter, Fatima, lived to  add numbers to his family: she was born to him by the pious female (a  widow) who was his first wife[11] and to whom he was united before he  commenced his work of conversion. Ali, to whom Fatima was married, was the  nephew of Mahumud, and from this union the Syaad race descend to the  present day. The Prophet observing real piety in Ali, designed him not  only to be the most suitable husband for his amiable daughter, but the  best qualified person to be chosen as his successor, when he should be  called by 'the hand of death'; and in the most public manner gave charge  of his flock to Ali, not long before that event occurred. Mahumud's speech  to Ali on that occasion is much reverenced by the Sheah sect;--it has been  translated for me by my husband, and is as follows:--    'You, my son, will suffer many persecutions in the cause of religion; many  will be the obstructions to your preaching, for I see they are not all as  obedient and faithful as yourself. Usurpers of the authority, delegated to  you, will arise, whose views are not pure and holy as your own; but let my  admonitions dwell on your mind, remember my advice without swerving. The  religion I have laboured to teach, is, as yet, but as the buds shooting  forth from the tree; tender as they are, the rude blasts of dissension may  scatter them to the winds, and leave the parent tree without a leaf:--but  suffered to push forth its produce quietly, the hand of Time will ripen  and bring to perfection that which has been the business of my awakened  life to cultivate. Never, my son, suffer your sword to be unsheathed in  the justice of your cause; I exhort you to bear this injunction on your  mind faithfully; whatever may be the provocations you receive, or insults  offered to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#19)"],[1," \"Sure I shall thus offend thy saints,  \"And grieve the men I love.\"    6 But still I found my doubts too hard,  The conflict too severe,  Till I retir'd to search thy word,  And learn thy secrets there.    7 There, as in some prophetic glass,  I saw the sinner's feet  High mounted on a slippery place,  Beside a fiery pit.    8 I heard the wretch profanely boast,  Till at thy frown he fell;  His honours in a dream were lost,  And he awakes in hell.    9 Lord, what an envious fool I was!  How like a thoughtless beast!  Thus to suspect thy promis'd grace,  And think the wicked blest.    10 Yet I was kept from full despair,  Upheld by power unknown;  That blessed hand that broke the snare  Shall guide me to thy throne.      Psalm 73:2. 23-8. Second Part.  God our portion here and hereafter.    1 God my supporter and my hope,  My help for ever near,  Thine arm of mercy held me up  When sinking in despair.    2 Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet  Thro' this dark wilderness;  Thine hand conduct me near thy seat  To dwell before thy face.    3 Were I in heaven without my God,  'Twould be no joy to me;  And whilst this earth is my abode,  I long for none but thee.    4 What if the springs of life were broke,  And flesh and heart should faint!  God is my soul's eternal rock,  The strength of every saint.    5 Behold the sinners that remove  Far from thy presence die;  Not all the idol gods they love  Can save them when they cry.    6 But to draw near to thee, my God,  Shall be my sweet employ;  My tongue shall sound thy works abroad,  And tell the world my joy.      Psalm 73:3. 22 3 6 17-20. L. M.  The prosperity of sinners cursed.    1 Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I,  To mourn, and murmur, and repine  To see the wicked plac'd on high,  In pride and robes of honour shine!    2 But O their end, their dreadful end!  Thy sanctuary taught me so:  On slippery rocks I see them stand,  And fiery billows roll below.    3 Now let them boast how tall they rise,  I'll never envy them again;  There they may stand with haughty eyes,  Till they plunge deep in endless pain.    4 Their fancy'd joys, how fast they flee!  Just like a dream when man awakes;  Their songs of softest harmony  Are but a preface to their plagues.    5 Now I esteem their mirth and wine  Too dear to purchase with my blood;  Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine,  My life, my portion, and my God.      Psalm 73:4. S. M.  The mystery of providence unfolded.    1 Sure there's a righteous God,  Nor is religion vain,  Tho' men of vice may boast aloud,  And men of grace complain.    2 I saw the wicked rise,  And felt my heart repine,  While haughty fools with scornful eyes  In robes of honour shine.    3 [Pamper'd with wanton ease,  Their flesh looks full and fair,  Their wealth rolls in like flowing seas,  And grows without their care.    4 Free from the plagues and pains  That pious souls endure,  Thro' all their life oppression reigns  And racks the humble poor.    5 Their impious tongues blaspheme  The everlasting God;  Their malice blasts the good man's name,  And spreads their lies abroad.    6 But I with flowing tears  Indulge my doubts to rise  \"Is there a God that sees or hears  \"The things below the skies?\"]    7 The tumults of my thought  Held me in hard suspense,  Till to thy house my feet were brought  To learn thy justice thence.    8 Thy word with light and power  Did my mistakes attend;  I view'd the sinners' life before,  But here I learnt their end.    9 On what a slippery steep  The thoughtless wretches go;  And O that dreadful fiery deep  That waits their fall below.    10 Lord, at thy feet I bow,  My thoughts no more repine;  I call my God my portion now,  And all my powers are thine.      Psalm 74.  The church pleading with God  under sore persecutions.    1 Will God for ever cast us off?  His wrath for ever smoke  Against the people of his love,  His little chosen flock?    2 Think of the tribes so dearly bought  With their Redeemer's blood;  Nor let thy Sion be forgot,  Where once thy glory stood.    3 Lift up thy feet and march in haste,  Aloud our ruin calls;  See what a wide and fearful waste  Is made within thy walls.    4 Where once thy churches pray'd and sang  Thy foes profanely roar;  Over thy gates their ensigns hang,  Sad tokens of their power.    5 How are the seats of worship broke!  They tear the buildings down,  And he that deals the heaviest stroke  Procures the chief renown.    6 With flames they threaten to destroy  Thy children in their nest;  \"Come let us burn at once (they cry)  The temple and the priest.\"    7 And still to heighten our distress  Thy presence is withdrawn;  Thy wonted signs of power and grace,  Thy power and grace are gone.    8 No prophet speaks to calm our woes,  But all the seers mourn;  There's not a soul amongst us knows  The time of thy return.    PAUSE.    9 How long, eternal God, how long  Shall men of pride blaspheme?  Shall saints be made their endless song,  And bear immortal shame?    10 Canst thou for ever sit and hear  Thine holy Name profan'd?  And still thy jealousy forbear,  And still withhold thine hand?    11 What strange deliverance hast thou shown  In ages long before!  And now no other God we own,  No other God adore.    12 Thou didst divide the raging sea  By thy resistless might,  To make thy tribes a wondrous way,  And then secure their flight.    13 Is not the world of nature thine,  The darkness and the day?  Didst thou not bid the morning shine,  And mark the sun his way?    14 Hath not thy power form'd every coast,  And set the earth its bounds,  With summer's heat and winter's frost,  In their perpetual rounds?    15 And shall the sons of earth and dust  That sacred power blaspheme?  Will not thy hand that form'd them first  Avenge thine injur'd Name?    16 Think on the covenant thou hast made,  And all thy words of love;  Nor let the birds of prey invade  And vex thy mourning dove.    17 Our foes would triumph in our blood,  And make our hope their jest;  Plead thy own cause, almighty God!  And give thy children rest.      Psalm 75.  Power and government from God alone.  Applied to the glorious Revolution by King William, or  the happy Accession of King George to the Throne.    1 To thee, most holy, and most high,  To thee, we bring our thankful praise;  Thy works declare thy name is nigh,  Thy works of wonder and of grace.    2 Britain was doom'd to be a slave,  Her frame dissolv'd, her fears were great;  When God a new supporter gave  To bear the pillars of the state.    3 He from thy hand receiv'd his crown,  And sware to rule by wholesome laws  His foot shall tread th' oppressor down,  His arm defend the righteous cause.    4 Let haughty sinners sink their pride,  Nor lift so high their scornful head;  But lay their foolish thoughts aside,  And own the king that God hath made.    5 Such honours never come by chance,  Nor do the winds promotion blow;  'Tis God the judge doth one advance,  'Tis God that lays another low.    6 No vain pretence to royal birth  Shall fix a tyrant on the throne:  God the great sovereign of the earth  Will rise and make his justice known.    7 [His hand holds out the dreadful cup  Of vengeance, mix'd with various plagues,  To make the wicked drink them up,  Wring out and taste the bitter dregs.    8 Now shall the Lord exalt the just,  And while he tramples on the proud,  And lays their glory in the dust,  My lips shall sing his praise aloud.]      Psalm 76.  Israel saved, and the Assyrians destroyed; or, God's  vengeance against his enemies proceeds from his church.    1 In Judah God of old was known;  His Name in Israel great;  In Salem stood his holy throne,  And Sion was his seat.    2 Among the praises of his saints  His dwelling there he chose;  There he receiv'd their just complaints  Against their haughty foes.    3 From Sion went his dreadful word,  And broke the threatening spear;  The bow, the arrows, and the sword,  And crush'd th' Assyrian war.    4 What are the earth's wide kingdoms else  But mighty hills of prey?  The hill on which Jehovah dwells  Is glorious more than they.    5 'Twas Sion's King that stopt the breath  Of captains and their bands:  The men of might slept fast in death,  And never found their hands.    6 At thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,  Both horse and chariot fell;  Who knows the terrors of thy rod?  Thy vengeance who can tell?    7 What power can stand before thy sight  When once thy wrath appears?  When heaven shines round with dreadful light,  The earth lies still and fears.    8 When God in his own sovereign ways  Comes down to save th' opprest,  The wrath of man shall work his praise,  And he'll restrain the rest.    9 [Vow to the Lord, and tribute bring,  Ye princes, fear his frown:  His terror shakes the proudest king,  And cuts an army down.    10 The thunder of his sharp rebuke  Our haughty foes shall feel:  For Jacob's God hath not forsook,  But dwells in Sion still.]      Psalm 77:1. First Part.  Melancholy assaulting, and hope prevailing.    1 To God I cry'd with mournful voice,  I sought his gracious ear,  In the sad day when troubles rose,  And fill'd the night with fear.    2 Sad were my days, and dark my nights,  My soul refus'd relief;  I thought on God the just and wise,  But thoughts increas'd my grief.    3 Still I complain'd, and still opprest,  My heart began to break;  My God, thy wrath forbid my rest,  And kept my eyes awake.    4 My overwhelming sorrows grew  Till I could speak no more;  Then I within myself withdrew,  And call'd thy judgments o'er.    5 I call'd back years and ancient times,  When I beheld thy face;  My spirit search'd for secret crimes  That might withhold thy grace.    6 I call'd thy mercies to my mind  Which I enjoy'd before;  And will the Lord no more be kind?  His face appear no more?    7 Will he for ever cast me off?  His promise ever fail?  Has he forgot his tender love?  Shall anger still prevail?    8 But I forbid this hopeless thought,  This dark"]]]
