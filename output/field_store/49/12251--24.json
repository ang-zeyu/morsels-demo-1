Each of you claim one-half of the word, and seem to resign the  other. But what strikes me most, is the poverty of the language which  has left such slight vestiges behind it.\"    \"You are in an error,\" said Sir Arthur; \"it was a copious language,  and they were a great and powerful people; built two steeples--one at  Brechin, one at Abernethy. The Pictish maidens of the blood-royal were  kept in Edinburgh Castle, thence called Castrum Puellarum.\"    \"A childish legend,\" said Oldbuck, \"invented to give consequence to  trumpery womankind. It was called the Maiden Castle, quasi lucus a non  lucendo, because it resisted every attack, and women never do.\"    \"There is a list of the Pictish kings,\" persisted Sir Arthur, \"well  authenticated from Crentheminachcryme (the date of whose reign is  somewhat uncertain) down to Drusterstone, whose death concluded their  dynasty. Half of them have the Celtic patronymic Mac prefixed--Mac,  id est filius;--what do you say to that, Mr. Oldbuck? There is Drust  Macmorachin, Trynel Maclachlin (first of that ancient clan, as it may  be judged), and Gormach Macdonald, Alpin Macmetegus, Drust Mactallargam\"  (here he was interrupted by a fit of coughing)--\"ugh, ugh, ugh--Golarge  Macchan--ugh, ugh--Macchanan--ugh--Macchananail, Kenneth--ugh--ugh--  Macferedith, Eachan Macfungus--and twenty more, decidedly Celtic names,  which I could repeat, if this damned cough would let me.\"    \"Take a glass of wine, Sir Arthur, and drink down that bead-roll of  unbaptized jargon, that would choke the devil--why, that last fellow has  the only intelligible name you have repeated--they are all of the tribe  of Macfungus--mushroom monarchs every one of them; sprung up from the  fumes of conceit, folly, and falsehood, fermenting in the brains of some  mad Highland seannachie.\"    \"I am surprised to hear you, Mr. Oldbuck: you know, or ought to know,  that the list of these potentates was copied by Henry Maule of Melguin,  from the Chronicles of Loch Leven and St. Andrews, and put forth by him  in his short but satisfactory history of the Picts, printed by Robert  Freebairn of Edinburgh, and sold by him at his shop in the Parliament  Close, in the year of God seventeen hundred and five, or six, I am not  precisely certain which--but I have a copy at home that stands next to my  twelvemo copy of the Scots Acts, and ranges on the shelf with them very  well. What say you to that, Mr. Oldbuck?\"    \"Say?--why, I laugh at Harry Maule and his history,\" answered Oldbuck,  \"and thereby comply with his request, of giving it entertainment  according to its merits.\"    \"Do not laugh at a better man than yourself,\" said Sir Arthur, somewhat  scornfully.    \"I do not conceive I do, Sir Arthur, in laughing either at him or his  history.\"    \"Henry Maule of Melgum was a gentleman, Mr. Oldbuck.\"    \"I presume he had no advantage of me in that particular,\" replied the  Antiquary, somewhat tartly.    \"Permit me, Mr. Oldbuck--he was a gentleman of high family, and ancient  descent, and therefore\"--    \"The descendant of a Westphalian printer should speak of him with  deference? Such may be your opinion, Sir Arthur--it is not mine. I  conceive that my descent from that painful and industrious typographer,  Wolfbrand Oldenbuck, who, in the month of December 1493, under the  patronage, as the colophon tells us, of Sebaldus Scheyter and Sebastian  Kammermaister, accomplished the printing of the great Chronicle of  Nuremberg--I conceive, I say, that my descent from that great restorer  of learning is more creditable to me as a man of letters, than if I had  numbered in my genealogy all the brawling, bullet-headed, iron-fisted,  old Gothic barons since the days of Crentheminachcryme--not one of whom,  I suppose, could write his own name.\"    \"If you mean the observation as a sneer at my ancestry,\" said the  knight, with an assumption of dignified superiority and composure, \"I  have the pleasure to inform you, that the name of my ancestor, Gamelyn  de Guardover, Miles, is written fairly with his own hand in the earliest  copy of the Ragman-roll.\"    \"Which only serves to show that he was one of the earliest who set the  mean example of submitting to Edward I. What have, you to say for the  stainless loyalty of your family, Sir Arthur, after such a backsliding  as that?\"    \"It's enough, sir,\" said Sir Arthur, starting up fiercely, and pushing  back his chair; \"I shall hereafter take care how I honour with my  company one who shows himself so ungrateful for my condescension.\"    \"In that you will do as you find most agreeable, Sir Arthur;--I hope,  that as I was not aware of the extent of the obligation which you have  done me by visiting my poor house, I may be excused for not having  carried my gratitude to the extent of servility.\"    \"Mighty well--mighty well, Mr. Oldbuck--I wish you a good evening--Mr.  a--a--a--Shovel--I wish you a very good evening.\"    Out of the parlour door flounced the incensed Sir Arthur, as if the  spirit of the whole Round Table inflamed his single bosom, and traversed  with long strides the labyrinth of passages which conducted to the  drawing-room.    \"Did you ever hear such an old tup-headed ass?\" said Oldbuck, briefly  apostrophizing Lovel. \"But I must not let him go in this mad-like way  neither.\"    So saying, he pushed off after the retreating Baronet, whom he traced  by the clang of several doors which he opened in search of the apartment  for tea, and slammed with force behind him at every disappointment.  \"You'll do yourself a mischief,\" roared the Antiquary; \"Qui ambulat in  tenebris, nescit quo vadit--You'll tumble down the back-stair.\"    Sir Arthur had now got involved in darkness, of which the sedative  effect is well known to nurses and governesses who have to deal with  pettish children. It retarded the pace of the irritated Baronet, if it  did not abate his resentment, and Mr. Oldbuck, better acquainted with  the locale, got up with him as he had got his grasp upon the handle of  the drawing-room door.    \"Stay a minute, Sir Arthur,\" said Oldbuck, opposing his abrupt entrance;  \"don't be quite so hasty, my good old friend. I was a little too rude  with you about Sir Gamelyn--why, he is an old acquaintance of mine, man,  and a favourite; he kept company with Bruce and Wallace--and, I'll be  sworn on a black-letter Bible, only subscribed the Ragman-roll with  the legitimate and justifiable intention of circumventing the false  Southern--'twas right Scottish craft, my good knight--hundreds did it.  Come, come, forget and forgive--confess we have given the young fellow  here a right to think us two testy old fools.\"    \"Speak for yourself, Mr. Jonathan Oldbuck,\" said Sir Arthur with much  majesty.    \"A-well, a-well--a wilful man must have his way.\"    With that the door opened, and into the drawing-room marched the  tall gaunt form of Sir Arthur, followed by Lovel and Mr. Oldbuck, the  countenances of all the three a little discomposed.    \"I have been waiting for you, sir,\" said Miss Wardour, \"to propose we  should walk forward to meet the carriage, as the evening is so fine.\"    Sir Arthur readily assented to this proposal, which suited the angry  mood in which he found himself; and having, agreeable to the established  custom in cases of pet, refused the refreshment of tea and coffee, he  tucked his daughter under his arm; and after taking a ceremonious leave  of the ladies, and a very dry one of Oldbuck--off he marched.    \"I think Sir Arthur has got the black dog on his back again,\" said Miss  Oldbuck.    \"Black dog!--black devil!--he's more absurd than womankind--What say you,  Lovel?--Why, the lad's gone too.\"    \"He took his leave, uncle, while Miss Wardour was putting on her things;  but I don't think you observed him.\"    \"The devil's in the people! This is all one gets by fussing and  bustling, and putting one's self out of one's way in order to give  dinners, besides all the charges they are put to!--O Seged, Emperor of  Ethiopia!\" said he, taking up a cup of tea in the one hand, and a volume  of the Rambler in the other,--for it was his regular custom to read while  he was eating or drinking in presence of his sister, being a practice  which served at once to evince his contempt for the society of  womankind, and his resolution to lose no moment of instruction,--\"O  Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia! well hast thou spoken--No man should presume  to say, This shall be a day of happiness.\"    Oldbuck proceeded in his studies for the best part of an hour,  uninterrupted by the ladies, who each, in profound silence, pursued some  female employment. At length, a light and modest tap was heard at the  parlour door. \"Is that you, Caxon?--come in, come in, man.\"    The old man opened the door, and thrusting in his meagre face, thatched  with thin grey locks, and one sleeve of his white coat, said in a  subdued and mysterious tone of voice, \"I was wanting to speak to you,  sir.\"    \"Come in then, you old fool, and say what you have got to say.\"    \"I'll maybe frighten the ladies,\" said the ex-friseur.    \"Frighten!\" answered the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#18)"],[1,"following a preposition as the principal word of a  phrase is in the _objective case_. _I_ and _he_ are _nominative_ forms.  _Me_ and _him_ are _objective_ forms.    The following sentences are therefore incorrect: It is _me_; It is _him_;  _Me_ gave the pen to _he_.    +DEFINITIONS.    _Person_ is that modification of a noun or pronoun which denotes the  speaker, the one spoken to, or the one spoken of.    The _First Person_ denotes the one speaking.    The _Second Person_ denotes the one spoken to.    The _Third Person_ denotes the one spoken of.    _Case_ is that modification of a noun or pronoun which denotes its office  in the sentence.    The _Nominative Case of a noun or pronoun_ denotes its office as subject or  as attribute complement.    The _Possessive Case of a noun or pronoun_ denotes its office as possessive  modifier.    The _Objective Case of a noun or pronoun_ denotes its office as object  complement, or as principal word in a prepositional phrase+.          LESSON 82.    NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.--PERSON AND CASE.    Tell the _person_ and _case_ of each of the following nouns and pronouns.    +_Remember_+ that a noun or pronoun used as an _explanatory modifier_ is in  the same case as the word which it explains, and that a noun or pronoun  used _independently_ is in the _nominative case_.      We Americans do things in a hurry.    You Englishmen take more time to think.    The Germans do their work with the most patience and deliberation.    We boys desire a holiday.    Come on, my men; I will lead you.    I, your teacher, desire your success.    You, my pupils, are attentive.    I called on Tom, the tinker.    Friends, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause.    Write simple sentences in which each of the following nouns shall be used  in the _three persons_ and in the _three cases_.    Andrew Jackson, Alexander, Yankees.    Write a sentence containing a noun in the _nominative_ case, used as an  _attribute;_ one in the _nominative_, used as an _explanatory modifier_;  one in the _nominative_, used independently.    Write a sentence containing a noun in the _objective case_, used to  _complete two predicate verbs_; one used to _complete_ a _participle_; one  used to _complete_ an _infinitive_; one used _with a preposition_ to make a  phrase; one used as an _explanatory modifier_.    +To the Teacher+.--See pp. 183, 184.          LESSON 83.    NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.--DECLENSION.    +DEFINITION.--_Declension_ is the arrangement of the cases of nouns and  pronouns in the two numbers+.    Declension of Nouns.    LADY.                _Singular_.   _Plural_.    _Nom_.     lady,        ladies,    _Pos_.     lady's,      ladies',    _Obj_.     lady;        ladies.    CHILD.                _Singular_.   _Plural_.    _Nom._     child,       children,    _Pos._     child's,     children's,    _Obj._     child;       children.      Declension of Pronouns.    PERSONAL PRONOUNS.    FIRST PERSON.                _Singular_.       _Plural_.    _Nom._     I,               we,    _Pos._     my _or_ mine,    our _or_ ours,    _Obj._     me;              us.    SECOND PERSON--_common form_.                _Singular_.       _Plural_.    _Nom._     you,             you,    _Pos._     your _or_ yours, your _or_ yours,    _Obj._     you;             you.      SECOND PERSON--_old form_.                _Singular_.       _Plural_.    _Nom._     thou,            ye or you,    _Pos._     thy _or_ thine,  your _or_ yours,    _Obj._     thee;            you.    THIRD PERSON--_masculine_.                _Singular_.       _Plural_.    _Nom._     he,              they,    _Pos._     his,             their _or_ theirs,    _Obj._     him;             them.    THIRD PERSON--_feminine_.                _Singular_.       _Plural_.    _Nom._     she,             they,    _Pos._     her _or_ hers,   their _or_ theirs,    _Obj._     her;             them.    THIRD PERSON----_neuter_.                _Singular_.       _Plural_.    _Nom._     it,              they,    _Pos._     its,             their _or_ theirs,    _Obj._     it;              them.      _Mine, ours, yours, thine, hers_, and _theirs_ are used when the name of  the thing possessed is omitted; as, This rose is _yours_ = This rose is  _your rose_.    COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS.    By joining the word _self_ to the possessive forms _my, thy, your_, and to  the objective forms _him, her, it_, the +_Compound Personal Pronouns_+ are  formed. They have no possessive case, and are alike in the nominative and  the objective.    Their plurals are _ourselves_, _yourselves_, and _themselves_. Form the  _compound personal pronouns_, and write their declension.    RELATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.      _Sing. and Plu._    _Nom._ who,    _Pos._ whose,    _Obj._ whom.      _Sing. and Plu._    _Nom._ which,    _Pos._ whose,    _Obj._ which.    _Of which_ is often used instead of the possessive form of the latter  pronoun.      _Sing. and Plu._    _Nom._ that,    _Pos._ ----,    _Obj._ that.      _Sing. and Plu._    _Nom._ what,    _Pos._ ----,    _Obj._ what.    _Ever_ and _soever_ are added to _who, which_, and _what_ to form the  +_Compound Relative Pronouns_+. They are used when the antecedent is  omitted. For declension, see above.          LESSON 84.    POSSESSIVE FORMS.    +RULE.--The _possessive case_ of nouns is formed in the singular by adding  to the nominative the apostrophe and the letter _s_ ('s); in the plural, by  adding (') only. If the plural does not end in _s_, the apostrophe and the  _s_ are both added+.    Write the _possessive singular_ and the _possessive plural_ of the  following nouns, and place an appropriate noun after each.      Robin, friend, fly, hero, woman, bee, mouse, cuckoo, fox, ox, man, thief,    fairy, mosquito, wolf, shepherd, farmer, child, neighbor, cow.    Possession may be expressed also by the preposition _of_ and the  _objective_; as, the _mosquito's_ bill = the bill _of_ the _mosquito_.    The possessive sign ('s) is confined _chiefly_ to the names of persons and  animals.    We do not say the _chair's_ legs, but the legs _of_ the _chair_. Regard  must be had also to the _sound_.    IMPROVE THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSIONS, and expand each into a simple sentence.      The sky's color; the cloud's brilliancy; the rose's leaves; my uncle's    partner's house; George's father's friend's farm; the mane of the horse    of my brother; my brother's horse's mane.    When there are several possessive nouns, all belonging to one word, the  possessive sign is added to the last only. If they modify different words,  the sign is added to each.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSIONS, and expand each into a simple sentence.    +Model+.--_Webster and Worcester's dictionary may be bought at Ticknor's  and Field's book-store_.    The possessive sign should be added to _Webster_, for the word _dictionary_  is understood immediately after. Webster and Worcester do not together  possess the same dictionary. The sign should not be added to _Ticknor_, for  the two men, Tieknor and Field, possess the same store.    Adam's and Eve's garden; Jacob's and Esau's father; Shakespeare and  Milton's works; Maud, Kate, and Clara's gloves; Maud's, Kate's, and Clara's  teacher was ----.    When one possessive noun is explanatory of another, the possessive sign is  added to the last only.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      I called at Tom's the tinker's.    They listened to Peter's the Hermit's eloquence.    This was the Apostle's Paul's advice.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      Our's, your's, hi's, their's, her's, it's, hisn, yourn, hern.          LESSON 85.    FORMS OF THE PRONOUN.    +_Remember_+ that _I, we, thou, ye, he, she, they_, and _who_ are  +_nominative_+ forms, and must not be used in the objective case.    +_Remember_+ that _me, us, thee, him, her, them_, and _whom_ are  +_objective_+ forms, and must not be used in the nominative case.    +To the Teacher+.--The _eight_ nominative forms and the _seven_ objective  forms given above are the only distinctive nominative and objective forms  in the English language. Let the pupils become familiar with them.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      Him and me are good friends.    The two persons were her and me.    Us girls had a jolly time.    It is them, surely.    Who will catch this? Me.    Them that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.    Who is there? Me.    It was not us, it was him.    Who did you see?    Who did you ask for?    +_Remember_+ that pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number,  gender, and person.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      Every boy must read their own sentences.    I gave the horse oats, but he would not eat it.    Every one must read it for themselves.    I took up the little boy, and set it on my knee.    +_Remember_+ that the relative _who_ represents persons; _which_, animals  and things; _that_, persons, animals, and things; and _what_, things.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      I have a dog who runs to meet me.    The boy which I met was quite lame.    Those which live in glass houses must not throw stones.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    +To the Teacher+.--For \"Schemes,\" see p. 186.    How many modifications have nouns and pronouns? Name and define each. How  many persons are there? Define each. How many cases are there? Define each.  How do you determine the case of an explanatory noun or pronoun? What is  declension? How are the forms _mine, yours_, etc., now used? What is the  rule for forming the possessive case? What words are used only in the  nominative case? What words are used only in the objective case? [Footnote:  _Her_ is used in the possessive case also.] How do you determine the  number, gender, and person of pronouns?          LESSON 86.
