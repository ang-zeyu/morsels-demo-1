And  Virata said, 'All these gems of mine are now as much mine as yours. Do  ye according to your pleasure live here happily. And ye smiter of foes  in battle, I will bestow on you damsels decked with ornaments, wealth in  plenty, and other things that ye may like. Delivered from perils today  by your prowess, I am now crowned with victory. Do ye all become the  lords of the Matsyas.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"And when the king of the Matsyas had addressed  them thus, those descendants of the Kurus with Yudhishthira at their  head, joining their hands, severally replied unto him saying, 'We are  well-pleased with all that thou sayest, O monarch. We, however, have  been much gratified that thou hast today been freed from thy foes.' Thus  answered, that foremost of kings, Virata the lord of the Matsyas, again  addressed Yudhishthira, saying, 'Come, we will install thee in  sovereignty of the Matsyas. And we will also bestow on thee things that  are rare on earth and are objects of desire, for thou deservest  everything at our hands. O foremost of Brahmanas of the _Vaiyaghra_  order I will bestow on thee gems and kine and gold and rubies and  pearls. I bow unto thee. It is owing to thee that I once more behold  today my sons and kingdom. Afflicted and threatened as I had been with  disaster and danger, it is through thy prowess that I have not succumbed  to the foe.' Then Yudhishthira again addressed the Matsyas, saying,  'Well-pleased are we with the delightful words that thou hast spoken.  Mayst thou be ever happy, always practising humanity towards all  creatures. Let messengers now, at thy command, speedily repair into the  city, in order to communicate the glad tidings to our friends, and  proclaim thy victory.' Hearing these words of him, king Matsya ordered  the messengers, saying, 'Do ye repair to the city and proclaim my  victory in battle. And let damsels and courtesans, decked in ornaments,  come out of the city with every kind of musical instruments.' Hearing  this command uttered by the king of the Matsyas, the men, laying the  mandate on their head, all departed with cheerful hearts. And having  repaired to the city that very night, they proclaimed at the hour of  sunrise the victory of the king about the city-gates.\"      SECTION XXXV    Vaisampayana said, \"When the king of the Matsyas, anxious of recovering  the kine, had set out in pursuit of the Trigartas, Duryodhana with his  counsellors invaded the dominions of Virata. And Bhishma and Drona, and  Karna, and Kripa acquainted with the best of weapons, Aswatthaman, and  Suvala's son, and Duhsasana, O lord of men, and Vivingsati and Vikarna  and Chitrasena endued with great energy, and Durmukha and  Dussaha,--these and many other great warriors, coming upon the Matsya  dominion speedily drove off the cowherds of king Virata and forcibly  took away the kine. And the Kauravas, surrounding all sides with a  multitude of cars, seized sixty thousands of kine. And loud was the yell  of woe set up by the cowherds smitten by those warriors in that terrible  conflict. And the chief of the cowherds, greatly affrighted speedily  mounted on a chariot and set out for the city, bewailing in affliction.  And entering the city of the king, he proceeded to the place, and  speedily alighting from the chariot, got in for relating (what had  happened). And beholding the proud son of Matsya, named Bhuminjaya, he  told him everything about the seizure of the royal kine. And he said,  'the Kauravas are taking away sixty thousand kine. Rise, therefore, O  enhancer of the kingdom's glory, for bringing back thy cattle. O prince,  if thou art desirous of achieving (the kingdom's) good set out thyself  without loss of time. Indeed, the king of the Matsyas left thee in the  empty city. The king (thy father) boasteth of thee in court, saying, \"My  son, equal unto me, is a hero and is the supporter of (the glory of) my  race. My son is a warrior skilled in arrows and weapons and is always  possessed of great courage.\"--Oh, let the words of that lord of men be  true! O chief of herd-owners, bring thou back the kine after vanquishing  the Kurus, and consume thou their troops with the terrific energy of thy  arrows. Do thou like a leader of elephants rushing at a herd, pierce the  ranks of the foe with straight arrows of golden wings, discharged from  thy bow. Thy bow is even like a _Vina_. Its two ends represent the ivory  pillows; its string, the main chord; its staff, the finger-board; and  the arrows shot from it musical notes. Do thou strike in the midst of  the foe that _Vina_ of musical sound.[34] Let thy steeds, O lord, of  silvery hue, be yoked unto thy car, and let thy standard be hoisted,  bearing the emblem of the golden lion. Let thy keen-edged arrows endued  with wings of gold, shot by thy strong arms, obstruct the path of those  kings and eclipse the very sun. Vanquishing all the Kurus in battle like  unto the wielder of the thunderbolt defeating the _Asuras_, return thou  again to the city having achieved great renown. Son of Matsya's king,  thou art the sole refuge of this kingdom, as that foremost of virtuous  warriors, Arjuna is of the sons of Pandu. Even like Arjuna of his  brothers, thou art, without doubt, the refuge of those dwelling within  these dominions. Indeed, we, the subject of this realm, have our  protector in thee.'\"        [34] To understand the comparison would require in the reader a      knowledge of the mechanism of the Indian Vina. Briefly, the Vina      consists of a bamboo of about two cubits attached to two gourds      towards its ends. Along the bamboo which serves the purpose of a      finger-board, is the main chord and several thinner wires. All      these pass over a number of frets, two and a half heptachords,      representing the total compass of the instrument. The wires rest      towards their ends on two pieces of ivory called Upadhanas in      Sanskrit or Swaris in Urdu.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by the cowherd in the presence  of the females, in words breathing courage, the prince indulging in  self-commendation within the female apartments, spoke these words.\"      SECTION XXXVI    \"Uttara said, 'Firm as I am in the use of the bow, I would set out this  very day in the track of the kine if only some one skilled in the  management of horses becomes my charioteer. I do not, however, know the  man who may be my charioteer. Look ye, therefore, without delay, for a  charioteer for me that am prepared for starting. My own charioteer was  slain in the great battle that was fought from day to day for a whole  month or at least for eight and twenty nights. As soon as I get another  person conversant with the management of the steeds, I will immediately  set out, hoisting high my own standard. Penetrating into the midst of  the hostile army abounding with elephants and horses and chariots, I  will bring back the kine, having vanquished the Kurus who are feeble in  strength and weak in weapons. Like a second wielder of the thunderbolt  terrifying the Danavas, I will bring back the kine this very moment,  affrighting in battle Duryodhana and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa and  Drona with his son, and other mighty bowmen assembled for fight. Finding  none (to oppose), the Kurus are taking away the kine. What can I do when  I am not there? The assembled Kurus shall witness my prowess today. And  they shall say unto one another, \"Is it Arjuna himself who is opposing  us?'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having heard these words spoken by the prince,  Arjuna fully acquainted with the import of everything, after a little  while cheerfully spake in private unto his dear wife of faultless  beauty, Krishna, the princess of Panchala, Drupada's daughter of slender  make, sprung from the (sacrificial) fire and endued with the virtues of  truthfulness and honesty and ever attentive to the good of her husbands.  And the hero said, 'Do thou, O beauteous one, at my request say unto  Uttara without delay, \"This Vrihannala was formerly the accomplished  resolute charioteer of Pandu's son (Arjuna). Tried in many a great  battle, even he will be thy charioteer.\"'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words uttered by the prince over  and over again in the midst of the women, Panchali could not quietly  bear those allusions to Vibhatsu. And bashfully stepping out from among  the women, the poor princess of Panchala gently spake unto him these  words, 'The handsome youth, looking like a mighty elephant and known by  the name of Vrihannala, was formerly the charioteer of Arjuna. A  disciple of that illustrious warrior, and inferior to none in use of the  bow, he was known to me while I was living with the Pandavas. It was by  him that the reins were held of Arjuna's excellent steeds when Agni  consumed the forest of Khandava. It was with him as charioteer that  Partha conquered all creatures at Khandava-prastha. In fact, there is no  charioteer equal unto him.'    \"Uttara said, 'Thou knowest, O _Sairindhri_, this youth. Thou knowest,  what this one of the neuter sex may or may not be. I cannot, however, O  blessed one, myself request Vrihannala to hold the reins of my horses.'    \"Draupadi said, 'Vrihannala, O hero, will without doubt, obey the words  of thy younger sister[35]--that damsel of graceful hips. If he consents  to be thy charioteer, thou wilt, without doubt, return, having  vanquished the Kurus and rescued thy kine.'        [35] Some read _kaniasi_ for _vaviasi_. Both words are the same,      and mean the same thing.    \"Thus addressed by the _Sairindhri_, Uttara spake unto his sister, 'Go  thyself, O thou of faultless beauty, and bring Vrihannala hither.' And  despatched by her brother, she hastily repaired to the dancing-hall  where that strong-armed son of Pandu was staying in disguise.\"      SECTION XXXVII "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 04 (#19)"],[1,"and in the society  of a beloved daughter. Immediately after his death a monument was  erected over his grave, which may be considered sumptuous for those  times.    In the midst of such brilliant success, and with such distinguished  proofs of respect and honor from his contemporaries, it would be  singular indeed if Shakespeare, notwithstanding the modesty of a great  mind, which he certainly possessed in a peculiar degree, should never  have dreamed of posthumous fame. As a profound thinker he had quite  accurately taken the measure of the circle of human capabilities, and  he could say to himself with confidence that many of his productions  would not easily be surpassed. What foundation then is there for the  contrary assertion, which would degrade the immortal artist to the  situation of a daily laborer for a rude multitude? Merely this, that  he himself published no edition of his whole works. We do not reflect  that a poet, always accustomed to labor immediately for the stage, who  has often enjoyed the triumph of overpowering assembled crowds of  spectators and drawing from them the most tumultuous applause, who the  while was not dependent on the caprice of crotchety stage directors,  but left to his own discretion to select and determine the mode of  theatrical representation, naturally cares much less for the closet of  the solitary reader. During the first formation of a national theatre,  more especially, we find frequent examples of such indifference. Of  the almost innumerable pieces of Lope de Vega, many undoubtedly were  never printed, and are consequently lost; and Cervantes did not print  his earlier dramas, though he certainly boasts of them as meritorious  works. As Shakespeare, on his retiring from the theatre, left his  manuscripts behind with his fellow-managers, he may have relied on  theatrical tradition for handing them down to posterity, which would  indeed have been sufficient for that purpose if the closing of the  theatres, under the tyrannical intolerance of the Puritans, had not  interrupted the natural order of things. We know, besides, that the  poets used then to sell the exclusive copyright of their pieces to the  theatre:[20] it is therefore not improbable that the right of property  in his unprinted pieces was no longer vested in Shakespeare, or had  not, at least, yet reverted to him. His fellow-managers entered on the  publication seven years after his death (which probably cut short his  own intention), as it would appear on their own account and for their  own advantage.    LECTURE XXIII    Ignorance or Learning of Shakespeare--Costume as observed by Shakespeare,  and how far necessary, or may be dispensed with in the Drama--Shakespeare  the greatest drawer of Character--Vindication of the genuineness of his  pathos--Play on words--Moral delicacy--Irony--Mixture of the Tragic and  Comic--The part of the Fool or Clown--Shakespeare's Language and  Versification.    Our poet's want of scholarship has been the subject of endless  controversy, and yet it is surely a very easy matter to decide.  Shakespeare was poor in dead school-cram, but he possessed a rich  treasury of living and intuitive knowledge. He knew a little Latin,  and even something of Greek, though it may be not enough to read with  ease the writers in the original. With modern languages also, the  French and Italian, he had, perhaps, but a superficial acquaintance.  The general direction of his mind was not to the collection of words  but of facts. With English books, whether original or translated, he  was extensively acquainted: we may safely affirm that he had read all  that his native language and literature then contained that could be  of any use to him in his poetical avocations. He was sufficiently  intimate with mythology to employ it, in the only manner he could  wish, in the way of symbolical ornament. He had formed a correct  notion of the spirit of Ancient History, and more particularly of that  of the Romans; and the history of his own country was familiar to him  even in detail. Fortunately for him it had not as yet been treated in  a diplomatic and pragmatic spirit, but merely in the chronicle-style;  in other words, it had not yet assumed the appearance of dry  investigations respecting the development of political relations,  diplomatic negotiations, finances, etc., but exhibited a visible image  of the life and movement of an age prolific of great deeds.  Shakespeare, moreover, was a nice observer of nature; he knew the  technical language of mechanics and artisans; he seems to have been  well traveled in the interior of his own country, while of others he  inquired diligently of traveled navigators respecting their  peculiarity of climate and customs. He thus became accurately  acquainted with all the popular usages, opinions, and traditions which  could be of use in poetry.    The proofs of his ignorance, on which the greatest stress is laid, are  a few geographical blunders and anachronisms. Because in a comedy  founded on an earlier tale, he makes ships visit Bohemia, he has been  the subject of much laughter. But I conceive that we should be very  unjust toward him, were we to conclude that he did not, as well as  ourselves, possess the useful but by no means difficult knowledge that  Bohemia is nowhere bounded by the sea. He could never, in that case,  have looked into a map of Germany, but yet describes elsewhere, with  great accuracy, the maps of both Indies, together with the discoveries  of the latest navigators.[21] In such matters Shakespeare is faithful  only to the details of the domestic stories. In the novels on which he  worked, he avoided disturbing the associations of his audience, to  whom they were known, by novelties--the correction of errors in  secondary and unimportant particulars. The more wonderful the story,  the more it ranged in a purely poetical region, which he transfers at  will to an indefinite distance. These plays, whatever names they bear,  take place in the true land of romance and in the very century of  wonderful love stories. He knew well that in the forest of Ardennes  there were neither the lions and serpents of the torrid zone, nor the  shepherdesses of Arcadia; but he transferred both to it,[22] because  the design and import of his picture required them. Here he considered  himself entitled to take the greatest liberties. He had not to do with  a hair-splitting, hypercritical age like ours, which is always seeking  in poetry for something else than poetry; his audience entered the  theatre, not to learn true chronology, geography, and natural history,  but to witness a vivid exhibition. I will undertake to prove that  Shakespeare's anachronisms are, for the most part, committed of set  purpose and deliberately. It was frequently of importance to him to  move the exhibited subjects out of the background of time and bring it  quite near us. Hence in _Hamlet_, though avowedly an old Northern  story, there runs a tone of modish society, and in every respect the  customs of the most recent period. Without those circumstantialities  it would not have been allowable to make a philosophical inquirer of  Hamlet, on which trait, however, the meaning of the whole is made to  rest. On that account he mentions his education at a university,  though, in the age of the true Hamlet of history, universities were  not in existence. He makes him study at Wittenberg, and no selection  of a place could have been more suitable. The name was very popular:  the story of _Dr. Faustus of Wittenberg_ had made it well known; it  was of particular celebrity in Protestant England, as Luther had  taught and written there shortly before, and the very name must have  immediately suggested the idea of freedom in thinking. I cannot even  consider it an anachronism that Richard the Third should speak of  Machiavelli. The word is here used altogether proverbially the  contents, at least, of the book entitled _Of the Prince_ (_Del  Principe_) have been in existence ever since the existence of tyrants;  Machiavelli was merely the first to commit them to writing.    That Shakespeare has accurately hit the essential custom, namely, the  spirit of ages and nations, is at least acknowledged generally by the  English critics; but many sins against external costume may be easily  remarked. Yet here it is necessary to bear in mind that the Roman  pieces were acted upon the stage of that day in the European dress.  This was, it is true, still grand and splendid, not so silly and  tasteless as it became toward the end of the seventeenth century.  (Brutus and Cassius appeared in the Spanish cloak; they wore, quite  contrary to the Roman custom, the sword by their side in time of  peace, and, according to the testimony of an eye witness,[23] it was,  in the dialogue where Brutus stimulates Cassius to the conspiracy,  drawn, as if involuntarily, half out of the sheath). This does in no  way agree with our way of thinking: we are not content without the  toga.    The present, perhaps, is not an inappropriate place for a few general  observations on costume, considered with reference to art. It has  never been more accurately observed than in the present day; art has  become a slop-shop for pedantic antiquities. This is because we live  in a learned and critical, but by no means poetical age. The ancients  before us used, when they had to represent the religions of other  nations which deviated very much from their own, to bring them into  conformity with the Greek mythology. In Sculpture, again, the same  dress, namely, the Phrygian, was adopted, once for all, for every  barbaric tribe. Not that they did not know that there were as many  different dresses as nations; but in art they merely wished to  acknowledge the great contrast between barbarian and civilized: and  this, they thought, was rendered most strikingly apparent in the  Phrygian garb.
