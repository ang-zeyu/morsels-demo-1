(From photographs of the plants. Natural size.)]    The other species which are distinctly characterized are _L.  pedunculata, L. viridis, L. dentata, L. heterophylla, L. pyrenaica, L.  pinnata, L. coronopifolia, L. abrotonoides, L. Lawii_, and _L.  multifida_.    The _L. multifida_ is synonymous with _L. Burmanii_. In Spain the  therapeutic properties of _L. dentata_ are alleged to be even more  marked than in the oils of any of the other species of lavender. It is  said to promote the healing of sluggish wounds, and when used in the  form of inhalation to have given good results in cases of severe  catarrh, and even in cases of diphtheria. In odor this oil strongly  suggests rosemary and camphor. Its specific gravity is 0.926 at 15 deg. C.  It distills almost completely between 170 deg. and 200 deg..    The specific gravity of the oil of _L. vera_ (according to Flueckiger and  Hanbury, _Pharmacographia_) ranges between 0.87 and 0.94. The same  authorities state that in a tube of 50 millimeters the plane of  polarization is diverted 4.2 deg. to the left.    Dr. Gladstone found (_Jnl. Ch. Soc._, xviii., 3) that a sample of pure  oil of _L. vera_, obtained from Dr. S. Piesse, indicated a specific  gravity of 0.8903 at 15 deg. C., and that its power of rotating the plane of  polarization (observed with a tube ten inches long) was -20 deg.. Compared  with these results he found the sp. gr. of oil of turpentine to be  0.8727, and the rotatory power -79 deg..    Although _L. staechas_ was well known to the ancients, no allusion  unquestionably referring to _L. vera_ has been found in the writings of  classical authors, the earliest mention of this latter plant being in  the twelfth century, by the Abbess Hildegard, who lived near  Bergen-on-the-Rhine. Under the name of _Llafant_ or _Llafantly_, it was  known to the Welsh physicians as a medicinal plant in the thirteenth  century. The best variety of _L. vera_--and there are several, although  unnamed--improved by cultivation in England, presents the appearance of  an evergreen undershrub of about two feet in height, with grayish green  linear leaves, rolled under at the edges, when young; the branches are  erect and give a bushy appearance to the plant; the flowers are borne on  a terminal spike, at the summit of along naked stalk, the spike being  composed of six to ten verticillasters, more widely separated toward the  base of the spike; in young plants two or four sub-spikes will branch  alternately in pairs from the main stalk; this indicates great vigor in  the plant, and occurs rarely after the second year of the plant's  growth. The floral leaves are rhomboidal, acuminate, and membraneous,  the upper ones being shorter than the calyces, bracteas obovate; the  calyces are bluish, nearly cylindrical, contracted toward the mouth, and  ribbed with many veins. The corolla is of a pale bluish violet, of a  deeper tint on the inner surface than the outer, tubular, two-lipped,  the upper lip with two and the lower with three lobes. Both the corolla  and calyx are covered with stellate hairs, among which are embedded  shining oil glands, to which the fragrance of the plant is due. The _L.  vera_ was identified in 1541, and introduced into England in 1568,  flourishing remarkably well under cultivation, and yielding an oil far  superior in delicacy of fragrance to that obtained from the wild plant,  or to that obtained from the same plant cultivated in any other country.    When it is remembered that north of the 50th degree of latitude the vine  yields little but garlands of leaves, and that we should attempt in vain  to cultivate the olive north of the 44th degree, it may seem strange  that the _Lavandula vera_, which is a native of about the same climate  as these, should resist, unprotected, the vigorous frosts of this  country. Even at Upsala, latitude 59 deg. 51' N., in the Botanic Garden, it  merely requires the shelter of a few branches to protect it in the  winter; but this hardiness may be accounted for by several physiological  reasons. Like all fruticulose labiates which have a hard compact tissue  and contain much oily matter, the lavender absorbs less moisture than  herbs which are soft and spongy, and, as it always prefers a dry  calcareous, even stony, soil, the northern cultivators find that by  selecting such localities the tissues of the plant take up so little  water that the frost does not injure them.    In a northern climate the length of the days in summer, and the natural  dryness of the air, compensate in some measure the reduction of  temperature, and mature the plant only to the extent sufficient for the  purpose for which it is grown. Perhaps the suspension of vital action  during winter, which must be more complete in northern latitudes, as our  frosts are more severe, tends to preserve certain plants, native of the  south, for it is observed that all plants are more sensitive to cold  when vegetation is active than when it is at rest. The vine is an  instance of this. On the other hand, when the plant is cultivated  further south than its natural boundary, the same causes seem to exert  their influence, but in the reverse sense. Lavender is cultivated on the  mountains of Yemen, in Arabia; the humidity, increasing inversely to the  latitude, compensates the exhaling force of the sun's rays, and the  elevation of the locality the effects of the heat.    Thus is confirmed, both in north and south, the law of vegetable  physiology observed by De Candolle, in the temperate climates of France,  and published in his \"Essai de Geographie Botanique,\" that \"plants can  best resist the effects of cold in a dry atmosphere, and the effects of  heat in a humid atmosphere.\" A mild, damp winter, like the one of  1889-1890, does more harm than a hard, seasonable frost, as the plants  are apt to make green shoots prematurely, and the late frosts nip off  these tender portions, each of which would otherwise have produced a  flower spike.    The very severe winter of 1890-1891 did not kill so many plants as the  one of 1889-1890. The stems and branches of lavender being ligneous and  strong are able to resist the force of the wind, and the plant thrives  best in a perfectly open locality, where the air circulates freely; the  oil and resin which it contains in abundance enable it to resist the  parching action of the wind and sun. Thus, on the most arid and sterile  ground on the mountain sides in the south, and especially in Spain,  plants of this genus flourish with more vigor in the season when most  other vegetation is scorched up by the ardent rays of the sun, and the  _Lavandula vera_ seems to have a predilection for such spots.    Certainly the plants then assume a more stunted appearance than in  richer soil, but at the same time the perfume is stronger and sweeter.  The calyces become charged with oil glands, and yield a greater  abundance of volatile oil.    In a very moist soil the water penetrates too much into the tissues,  detaches the bark, the plant blackens at the root, and a white fungus  attaches to the main stem and lower branches; it becomes feeble,  diseased, and dies. A rich soil furnishes too much nutriment, the plant  grows very large and herbaceous, becomes overcharged with water relative  to its assimilating and elaboratory power, especially if growing in a  cold climate, and the equilibrium of the chemical proportions necessary  for the formation of natural juices becomes deranged at the expense of  quantity and quality of the volatile oil produced.    These facts, long ago pointed out by Linnaeus, have been verified in  England. Some years ago a disease manifested itself in most of the  plantations, which, not being understood by the growers, was not  remedied (in fact, is not generally understood and remedied at the  present time), the acreage under cultivation decreased, and, partly  owing to this and a scarcity occasioned by a failure in the crop, the  price of the oil rapidly rose from 50s. to 200s. per lb. Consequently,  with the continually increasing demand and the continued rise in price,  manufacturers of lavender water and of compound perfumes in which oil of  lavender is a necessary ingredient commenced to buy the French oil, and  venders of the English oil commenced to adulterate largely the English  with the French oil.    By degrees the French oil become almost entirely substituted in England  for the English, and at present it is difficult to purchase true English  lavender water of a quality equal to that vended twenty years ago,  except at a few first class houses.    The exorbitant profits demanded by chemists and druggists, and the  incomprehensible will of the public to buy anything _cheap_, however  bad, have encouraged a marvelous increase in the figures of the imports  of French (and German, which is worse) oil.    In 1880, when the price had reached 125s. per lb., it was pointed out by  an eminent London firm that unless the cultivation in England were  extended, the price would become prohibitive, inferior oils would be  introduced into the market, and so destroy the popularity of this  beautiful perfume.    The price still rising did, in fact, induce this importation, and to  this day the bulk of chemists and perfumers continue to use these  foreign oils, notwithstanding the fall in the price of the English oil.    The constant demand, however, in America (where people will have things  good) will yet support the price of the genuine article--that is, of the  English oil, which is the finest the world produces. Attempts were made  by a French manufacturing perfumer to establish a plantation in the  south of France of plants taken from parent stems grown in England.    The result was that the young plants deteriorated to their original  condition--even there in their native habitat.

A slip of glass  is placed under each foot; the part which supports the mushroom is covered  with an insulating varnish, which prevents the formation of climbing salts  and preserves the screws from rust. A common layer of insulating varnish is  applied under the head of the mushroom.    As regards the advantages of the Montaud accumulator we notice, first, its  longevity. Dr. D'Arsonval points out that the accumulators of the Plante  class have a great advantage over the Faure type as regards duration, and  that the most striking quality of the Montaud accumulator is its longevity.  The inventor has in his possession positive plates, five to six years old,  completely peroxidized, though there remains in the interior a thin core of  metallic lead sufficient to give passage to the current. The adhesion of  the peroxide is such that to detach it, it must be beaten with a hammer  upon an anvil. The next four points--i.e., the rapidity of charge; the  yield, much greater than that of any other system in proportion to its  surface; its small weight in comparison with its yield; and its capacity,  which for an equal weight is greater than that of any other accumulator. In  his experiments in September, 1885, Dr. D'Arsonval obtained with an  accumulator of 2 square meters of surface:        Useful capacity        40 ampere hours.      Total                  62   \"      \"      Surface                 2 square meters      Charge                 10 amp. per sq. meter.      Discharge              20  \"    \"        \"      Useful weight of lead  10 kilos.    Representing a total capacity of six ampere hours per kilo., and of a  discharge of 5 amperes per kilo., or a total capacity of 81 ampere hours  per square meter, and a useful capacity of 20 ampere hours per square  meter. Subsequently the modification of the negative plate has greatly  improved these figures, which will certainly become much more advantageous  in future. The total capacity of an accumulator having exactly 13/4 meters of  surface has become 87 ampere hours, which if referred to an accumulator of  2 square meters of surface, would give the following results:        Useful weight of lead per sq. meter           51/2   kilos.      Total capacity of useful lead per kilo        9.1  amp. hr.

A capital defect in this respect has hitherto much interfered with the use  of accumulators. In case of accidents, several kinds of which are possible,  it is found very difficult to rectify the apparatus. The Montaud  accumulator is much less liable to accidents, on account of the firmness  and compactness of its construction, and if any accident happens, the  repairs are simple and easy. Lastly, the stout framework secures the  apparatus from any accident due to a disproportionate charge or discharge.  The peculiarities of the combs and rods already described solve this  problem. On September 8, 1885, Dr. D'Arsonval, professor at the College of  France, wrote as follows: \"The Montaud accumulator is of the Plante type,  and is extremely well conceived from a mechanical point of view. The  wooden combs prevent the plates from coming in mutual contact, and give the  apparatus great solidity. The process of formation is ingenious and rapid.  To give 1 square meter a capacity of 20 ampere hours, there is required  only a quarter of an hour's treatment.    \"To obtain the same result by Plante's method, months are required. The  entire experiments have been effected with No. 2, which has a surface of  two square meters. This apparatus, if charged to saturation, gives 62  ampere hours as its total capacity, and, as in the Plante, this capacity  constantly increases with use. The normal rule for the charge is 10 amperes  per square meter, and for the discharge double this quantity. This  apparatus has always given me on discharging 40 amperes at the E.M.F. of  1.85 volts during 60 or 65 minutes. The charge is effected in two hours up  to 20 amperes, without any appreciable loss of electricity.    \"The points to be aimed at in an accumulator are longevity and energy, or,  rather, rapid yield per kilo. From both points of view accumulators of the  Plante type (and consequently those of Montaud) are far superior to those  of the Faure type. My opinion, therefore, is that the Montaud accumulator  is very practical, that it is a great improvement on the Plante type, and  that it can compete successfully with the other systems in use.\"--_Revue  Internationale de l'Electricite._           *       *       *       *       *          ELECTRIC REGISTERING APPARATUS FOR METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS.      Mr. E. Gime, whose name is not unknown to our readers, sends us a  description of a certain number of meteorological apparatus to which he has  applied a peculiar method of registering that it is of interest to make  known.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--DIAGRAM OF GIME'S TELEMAREOGRAPH.]    Mr. Gime in the first place has devised a \"telemareograph,\" that is to say,  an apparatus designed to register at a distance the curve of the motions of  the tide in a given place. The structure of this device, shown  diagramatically in Fig. 1, is very simple. It is divided into two distinct  parts--a transmitter and a registering apparatus. The transmitter consists  of a long glass tube, A, closed at one end and communicating through the  other with a receptacle filled with mercury. A barometric vacuum is formed  in this tube. The level of the open receptacle corresponds exactly to the  level of the lowest tide.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE APPARATUS WITH THREE REGISTERING STATIONS.]    Pieces of iron wire projecting sufficiently in the interior to establish  good contacts with the column of mercury are fastened one millimeter apart  to the inner surface of the tube. These iron contacts are connected with  the divisions of a rheostat, R, arranged in a tight compartment surrounded  with paraffine, near the tube.    This rheostat is interposed in the general circuit. It is connected through  one extremity with the line, and through the other with a disk of copper,  which has a surface of one square meter, and is immersed in the sea.    The line, L, insulated like an ordinary telegraph wire, is prolonged as far  as to the registering station.    The registering apparatus consists of a solenoid, S, that acts upon a soft  iron core suspended by a cord from the extremity, _x_, of the beam of a  balance. This cord passes between the channels of two rollers designed,  despite the motion of the beam, to keep the core in a vertical position in  the center of the solenoid.    The opposite arm of the balance carries a sliding weight, _i_, that moves  over a graduated scale and is designed to balance the core, N, in a certain  position in regulating the motions of the curve. At its extremity it  carries a style that bears against the drum, T, on which the paper is wound  that is to receive the mareometric curve.    The solenoid, S, is interposed in the general circuit, being connected on  the one hand with the line, L, and on the other with a very constant  battery of an electromotive force proportioned to the resistance of the  circuit.    Through the electrode that remains free, the battery is grounded with so  great care that no variation in resistance can be produced thereby. If the  station is near the sea, the conductor of this electrode may be run to a  copper disk, having the same surface as the one at the transmitting  station. With this description, the operation of the apparatus may be  easily understood.    At low water, the pressure of the atmosphere balances a column of mercury  rising in a glass tube to a height proportionate to such pressure. In  measure as the level of the water rises, the pressure on the mercury in the  receptacle increases, and causes the metal to rise in the tube. The higher  the level of the sea, the less becomes the sum of the resistances of the  rheostat, since the column of mercury puts in short circuit all the  divisions of the rheostat, whose contacts are comprised in the height of  the column.    From these variations in the resistance of the circuit naturally result  variations in the current from the battery, B, at the registering station.  To the variations in intensity of the current in the circuit there  correspond variations in the attraction of the solenoid for the core that  transmits these motions to the balance that carries the registering style,  which latter amplifies or reduces them.    The same transmitter suffices for various registering stations arranged in  series, as shown in Fig. 2.    The variations in the resistance of the circuit, due to variations in the  temperature, and the variations in the height of the column of mercury, due  to atmospheric variations, etc., are, according to the inventor, of no  importance.    It would evidently be possible, on the same principle, to construct an  apparatus for registering the indications of a thermometer at a distance.    Such is the principle of Mr. Gime's apparatus. We do not believe that they  are entirely closed to criticism. What, in fact, are the conditions  essential for their proper working? Evidently: (1) the constancy of the  battery used; (2) a rigorously accurate adjustment. This latter condition,  is easily realized; but the same is not the case with the former. Of what"]]]
