In the very centre of Gaul, between the Loire and  the Allier, a peasant, who has kept in history his Gallic name of Marie  or Maricus, formed a band, and scoured the country, proclaiming national  independence.  He was arrested by the local authorities and handed over  to Vitellius, who had him thrown to the beasts.  But in the northern part  of Belgica, towards the mouths of the Rhine, where a Batavian peoplet  lived, a man of note amongst his compatriots and in the service of the  Romans, amongst whom he had received the name of Claudius Civilis,  embraced first secretly, and afterwards openly, the cause of  insurrection.  He had vengeance to take for Nero's treatment, who had  caused his brother, Julius Paulus, to be beheaded, and himself to be put  in prison, whence he had been liberated by Galba.  He made a vow to let  his hair grow until he was revenged.  He had but one eye, and gloried in  the fact, saying that it had been so with Hannibal and with Sertorius,  and that his highest aspiration was to be like them.  He pronounced first  for Vitellius against Otho, then for Vespasian against Vitellius, and  then for the complete independence of his nation against Vespasian.  He  soon had, amongst the Germans on the two banks of the Rhine and amongst  the Gauls themselves, secret or declared allies.  He was joined by a  young Gaul from the district of Langres, Julius Sabinus, who boasted  that, during the great war with the Gauls, his great-grandmother had  taken the fancy of Julius Caesar, and that he owed his name to him.  News  had just reached Gaul of the burning down, for the second time, of the  Capitol during the disturbances at Rome on the death of Nero.  The Druids  came forth from the retreats where they had hidden since Claudius'  proscription, and reappeared in the towns and country-places, proclaiming  that \"the Roman empire was at an end, that the Gallic empire was  beginning, and that the day had come when the possession of all the world  should pass into the hands of the Transalpine nations.\"  The insurgents  rose in the name of the Gallic empire, and Julius Sabinus assumed the  title of Caesar.  War commenced.  Confusion, hesitation, and actual  desertion reached the colonies and extended positively to the Roman  legions.  Several towns, even Troves and Cologne, submitted or fell into  the hands of the insurgents.  Several legions, yielding to bribery,  persuasion, or intimidation, went over to them, some with a bad grace,  others with the blood of their officers on their hands.  The gravity of  the situation was not misunderstood at Rome.  Petilius Cerealis, a  commander of renown for his campaigns on the Rhine, was sent off to  Belgica with seven fresh legions.  He was as skilful in negotiation and  persuasion as he was in battle.  The struggle that ensued was fierce, but  brief; and nearly all the towns and legions that had been guilty of  defection returned to their Roman allegiance.  Civilis, though not more  than half vanquished, himself asked leave to surrender.  The Batavian  might, as was said at the time, have inundated the country, and drowned  the Roman armies.  Vespasian, therefore, not being inclined to drive men  or matters to extremity, gave Civilis leave to go into retirement and  live in peace amongst the marshes of his own land.  The Gallic chieftains  alone, the projectors of a Gallic empire, were rigorously pursued and  chastised.  There was especially one, Julius Sabinus, the pretended  descendant of Julius Caesar, whose capture was heartily desired.  After  the ruin of his hopes he took refuge in some vaults connected with one of  his country houses.  The way in was known only to two devoted freedmen of  his, who set fire to the buildings, and spread a report that Sabinus had  poisoned himself, and that his dead body had been devoured by the flames.  He had a wife, a young Gaul named Eponina, who was in frantic despair at  the rumor; but he had her informed, by the mouth of one of his freedmen,  of his place of concealment, begging her at the same time to keep up a  show of widowhood and mourning, in order to confirm the report already in  circulation.  \"Well did she play her part,\" to use Plutarch's expression,  \"in her tragedy of woe.\"  She went at night to visit her husband in his  retreat, and departed at break of day; and at last would not depart at  all.  At the end of seven months, hearing great talk of Vespasian's  clemency, she set out for Rome, taking with her her husband, disguised as  a slave, with shaven head and a dress that made him unrecognizable.  But  the friends who were in their confidence advised them not to risk as yet  the chance of imperial clemency, and to return to their secret asylum.  There they lived for nine years, during which \"as a lioness in her den,  neither more nor less,\" says Plutarch, \"Eponina gave birth to two young  whelps, and suckled them herself at her teat.\"  At last they were  discovered and brought before Vespasian at Rome: \"Caesar,\" said Eponina,  showing him her children, \"I conceived them and suckled them in a tomb,  that there might be more of us to ask thy mercy.\"    [Illustration: Eponina and Sabinus hidden in a Vault----97]    But Vespasian was merciful only from prudence, and not by nature or from  magnanimity; and he sent Sabinus to execution.  Eponina asked that she  might die with her husband, saying, \"Caesar, do me this grace; for I have  lived more happily beneath the earth and in the darkness than thou in the  splendor of thy empire.\"  Vespasian fulfilled her desire by sending her  also to execution; and Plutarch, their contemporary, undoubtedly  expressed the general feeling, when he ended his tale with the words,  \"In all the long reign of this emperor there was no deed so cruel or so  piteous to see; and he was afterwards punished for it, for in a short  time all his posterity was extinct.\"    In fact the Caesars and the Flavians met the same fate; the two lines  began and ended alike; the former with Augustus and Nero, the latter with  Vespasian and Domitian; first a despot, able, cold, and as capable of  cruelty as of moderation, then a tyrant, atrocious and detested.  And  both were extinguished without a descendant.  Then a rare piece of good  fortune befell the Roman world.  Domitian, two years before he was  assassinated by some of his servants whom he was about to put to death,  grew suspicious of an aged and honorable senator, Cocceius Nerva, who had  been twice consul, and whom he had sent into exile, first to Tarenturn,  and then in Gaul, preparatory, probably, to a worse fate.  To this victim  of proscription application was made by the conspirators who had just got  rid of Domitian, and had to get another emperor.  Nerva accepted, but not  without hesitation, for he was sixty-four years old; he had witnessed the  violent death of six emperors, and his grandfather, a celebrated jurist,  and for a long while a friend of Tiberius, had killed himself, it is  said, for grief at the iniquitous and cruel government of his friend.  The short reign of Nerva was a wise, a just, and a humane, but a sad one,  not for the people, but for himself.  He maintained peace and order,  recalled exiles, suppressed informers, re-established respect for laws  and morals, turned a deaf ear to self-interested suggestions of  vengeance, spoliation, and injustice, proceeding at one time from those  who had made him emperor, at another from the Praetorian soldiers and the  Roman mob, who regretted Domitian just as they had Nero.  But Nerva did  not succeed in putting a stop to mob-violence or murders prompted by  cupidity or hatred.  Finding his authority insulted and his life  threatened, he formed a resolution which has been described and explained  by a learned and temperate historian of the last century, Lenain de  Tillemont (_Histoire des Empereurs,_ &c., t. ii.  p. 59), with so much  justice and precision that it is a pleasure to quote his own words.  \"Seeing,\" says he, \"that his age was despised, and that the empire  required some one who combined strength of mind and body, Nerva, being  free from that blindness which prevents one from discussing and measuring  one's own powers, and from that thirst for dominion which often prevails  over even those who are nearest to the grave, resolved to take a partner  in the sovereign power, and showed his wisdom by making choice of  Trajan.\"  By this choice, indeed, Nerva commenced and inaugurated the  finest period of the Roman empire, the period that contemporaries  entitled the golden age, and that history has named the age of the  Antonines.  It is desirable to become acquainted with the real character  of this period, for to it belong the two greatest historical events--the  dissolution of ancient pagan, and the birth of modern Christian society.    Five notable sovereigns, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and  Marcus Aurelius swayed the Roman empire during this period (A.D. 96-150).  What Nerva was has just been described; and he made no mistake in  adopting Trajan as his successor.  Trajan, unconnected by origin, as  Nerva also had been, with old Rome, was born in Spain, near Seville, and  by military service in the East had made his first steps towards fortune  and renown.  He was essentially a soldier--a moral and a modest soldier;  a friend to justice and the public weal; grand in what he undertook for  the empire he governed; simple and modest on his own score; respectful  towards the civil authority and the laws; untiring and equitable in the  work of provincial administration; without any philosophical system or  pretensions; full of energy and boldness, honesty and good sense.  He  stoutly defended the empire against the Germans on the banks of the  Danube, won for it the province of Dacia, and, being more taken up with  the East than the West, made many Asiatic conquests, of which his  successor,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11952"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"where he was told he would find  them numerous and powerful.  \"He repaired,\" says a contemporary  chronicler, \"to the castle of Vertfeuil (or Verfeil, in the district of  Toulouse), where flourished at that time the scions of a numerous  nobility and of a multitude of people, thinking that, if he could  extinguish heretical perversity in this place where it was so very much  spread, it would be easy for him to make head against it elsewhere.  When  he had begun preaching, in the church, against those who were of most  consideration in the place, they went out, and the people followed them;  but the holy man, going out after them, gave utterance to the word of God  in the public streets.  The nobles then hid themselves on all sides in  their houses; and as for him, he continued to preach to the common people  who came about him.  Whereupon, the others making uproar and knocking  upon the doors, so that the crowd could not hear his voice, he then,  having shaken off the dust from his feet as a testimony against them,  departed from their midst, and, looking on the town, cursed it, saying,  'Vertfeuil, God wither thee!'  Now there were, at that time, in the  castle, a hundred knights abiding, having arms, banners, and horses, and  keeping themselves at their own expense, not at the expense of other.\"    After the not very effectual mission of St. Bernard, who died in 1153,  and for half a century, the orthodox Church was several times occupied  with the heretics of Southern France, who were before long called  Albigensians, either because they were numerous in the diocese of Albi,  or because the council of Lombers, one of the first at which their  condemnation was expressly pronounced (in 1165), was held in that  diocese.  But the measures adopted at that time against them were at  first feebly executed, and had but little effect.  The new ideas spread  more and more; and in 1167 the innovators themselves held, at  St. Felix-de-Caraman, a petty council, at which they appointed bishops  for districts where they had numerous partisans.  Raymond VI., who, in  1195, succeeded his father, Raymond V., as Count of Toulouse, was  supposed to be favorably disposed towards them; he admitted them to  intimacy with him, and, it was said, allowed himself, in respect of the  orthodox Church, great liberty of thought and speech.  Meanwhile the  great days and the chief actors in the struggle commenced by St. Bernard  were approaching.  In 1198, Lothaire Conti, a pupil of the University of  Paris, was elected pope, with the title of Innocent III.; and, four or  five years later, Simon, Count of Montfort l'Amaury, came back from the  fifth crusade in the East, with a celebrity already established by his  valor and his zeal against the infidels.  Innocent III., no unworthy  rival of Gregory VII., his late predecessor in the Holy See, had the same  grandeur of ideas and the same fixity of purpose, with less headiness in  his character, and more knowledge of the world, and more of the spirit of  policy.  He looked upon the whole of Christendom as his kingdom, and upon  himself as the king whose business it was to make prevalent everywhere  the law of God.  Simon, as Count of Montfort l'Amaury, was not a powerful  lord; but he was descended, it was said, from a natural son of King  Robert his mother, who was English, had left him heir to the earldom of  Leicester, and he had for his wife Alice de Montmorency.  His social  status and his personal renown, superior as they were to his worldly  fortunes, authorized in his case any flight of ambition; and in the East  he had learned to believe that anything was allowed to him in the service  of the Christian faith.  Innocent III., on receiving the tiara, set to  work at once upon the government of Christendom.  Simon de Montfort, on  returning from Palestine, did not dream of the new crusade to which he  was soon to be summoned, and for which he was so well prepared.    Innocent III. at first employed against the heretics of Southern France  only spiritual and legitimate weapons.  Before proscribing, he tried to  convert them; he sent to them a great number of missionaries, nearly all  taken from the order of Citeaux, and of proved zeal already; many amongst  them had successively the title and power of legates; and they went  preaching throughout the whole country, communicating with the princes  and laic lords, whom they requested to drive away the heretics from their  domains, and holding with the heretics themselves conferences which  frequently drew a numerous attendance.  A knight \"full of sagacity,\"  according to a contemporary chronicler, \"Pons d'Adhemar, of Rodelle, said  one day to Foulques, Bishop of Toulouse, one of the most zealous of the  pope's delegates, 'We could not have believed that Rome had so many  powerful arguments against these folk here.'  'See you not,' said the  bishop, 'how little force there is in their objections?'  'Certainly,'  answered the knight.  'Why, then, do you not expel them from your lands?'  'We cannot,' answered Pons; 'we have been brought up with them; we have  amongst them folk near and dear to us, and we see them living honestly.'\"  Some of the legates, wearied at the little effect of their preaching,  showed an inclination to give up their mission.  Peter de Castelnau  himself, the most zealous of all, and destined before long to pay for his  zeal with his life, wrote to the pope to beg for permission to return to  his monastery.  Two Spanish priests, Diego Azebes, Bishop of Osma, and  his sub-prior Dominic, falling in with the Roman legates at Montpellier,  heard them express their disgust.  \"Give up,\" said they to the legates,  \"your retinue, your horses, and your goings in state; proceed in all  humility, afoot and barefoot, without gold or silver, living and teaching  after the example of the Divine Master.\"  \"We dare not take on ourselves  such things,\" answered the pope's agents; \"they would seem sort of  innovation; but if some person of sufficient authority consent to precede  us in such guise, we would follow him readily.\"  The Bishop of Osma sent  away his retinue to Spain, and kept with him only his companion Dominic;  and they, taking with them two of the monks of Citeaux, Peter de  Castelnau and Raoul,--the most fervent of the delegates from Rome,--began  that course of austerity and of preaching amongst the people which was  ultimately to make of the sub-prior Dominic a saint and the founder of a  great religious order, to which has often, but wrongly, been attributed  the origin, though it certainly became the principal agent, of the  Inquisition.  Whilst joining in humble and pious energy with the two  Spanish priests, the two monks of Citeaux, and Peter de Castelnau  especially, did not cease to urge amongst the laic princes the  extirpation of the heretics.  In 1205 they repaired to Toulouse to demand  of Raymond VI. a formal promise, which indeed they obtained; but Raymond  was one of those undecided and feeble characters who dare not refuse to  promise what they dare not attempt to do.  He wished to live in peace  with the orthodox Church without behaving cruelly to a large number of  his subjects.  The fanatical legate, Peter de Castelnau, enraged at his  tergiversation, instantly excommunicated him; and the pope sent the count  a threatening letter, giving him therein to understand that in case of  need stronger measures would be adopted against him.  Raymond,  affrighted, prevailed on the two legates to repair to St. Gilles, and he  there renewed his promises to them; but he always sought for and found on  the morrow some excuse for retarding the execution of them.  The legates,  after having reproached him vehemently, determined to leave St. Gilles  without further delay, and the day after their departure (January 15th,  1208), as they were getting ready to cross the Rhone, two strangers, who  had lodged the night before in the same hostelry with them, drew near,  and one of the two gave Peter de Castelnau a lance-thrust with such  force, that the legate, after exclaiming, \"God forgive thee, as I do!\"  had only time to give his comrade his last instructions, and then  expired.    Great was the emotion in France and at Rome.  It was barely thirty years  since in England, after an outburst of passion on the part of King Henry  II., four knights of his court had murdered the Archbishop Thomas-a-  Becket in Canterbury Cathedral.  Was the Count of Toulouse, too, guilty  of having instigated the shedding of blood and the murder of a prelate?  Such was, in the thirteenth century, the general cry throughout the  Catholic Church and the signal for war against Raymond VI.; a war  undertaken on the plea of a personal crime, but in reality for the  extirpation of heresy in Southern France, and for the dispossession of  the native princes, who would not fully obey the decrees of the papacy,  in favor of foreign conquerors who would put them into execution.  The  crusade against the Albigensians was the most striking application of two  principles equally false and fatal, which did more than as much evil to  the Catholics as to the heretics, and to the papacy as to freedom; and  they are, the right of the spiritual power to claim for the coercion of  souls the material force of the temporal powers, and its right to strip  temporal sovereigns, in case they set at nought its injunctions, of their  title to the obedience of their people; in other words, denial of  religious liberty to conscience and of political independence to states.  It was by virtue of these two principles, at that time dominant, but not  without some opposition, in Christendom, that Innocent III., in 1208,  summoned the King of France, the great lords and the knights, and the  clergy, secular and regular, of the kingdom to assume the cross and go  forth to extirpate from Southern France the Albigensians, \"worse than the  Saracens;\" and that he promised to"]]]
