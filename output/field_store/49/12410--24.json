[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#19)"],[1,"with Dill, so that, when  he saddled Barney and told Jim Bleeker to keep things moving till  to-morrow or the day after, he had the comfortable inner assurance  that there were no side-glances or smiles and no lowered lids when he  rode away. For Charming Billy, while he would have faced the ridicule  of a nation if that were the price he must pay to win his deep desire,  was yet well pleased to go on his way unwatched and unneeded.    Since the Double-Crank ranch lay with Burnt Willow Creek loitering  through the willows within easy gunshot of the corrals, Billy's trail  followed the creek except in its most irresponsible windings, when he  would simplify his journey by taking straight as might be across the  prairie. It was after he had done this for the second time and had  come down to the creek through a narrow, yellow-clay coulee that he  came out quite suddenly upon a thing he had not before seen.    Across the creek, which at that point was so narrow that a horse could  all but clear it in a running jump, lay the hills, a far-reaching  ocean of fertile green. Good grazing it was, as Billy well knew.  In another day the Double-Crank riders would be sweeping over it,  gathering the cattle; at least, that had been his intent. He looked  across and his eyes settled immediately upon a long, dotted line drawn  straight away to the south; at the far end a tiny huddle of figures  moved indeterminately, the details of their business blunted by the  distance. But Charming Billy, though he liked them little, knew well  when he looked upon a fence in the building. The dotted line he read  for post holes and the distant figures for the diggers.    While his horse drank he eyed the line distrustfully until he  remembered his parting advice to Dill. \"Dilly's sure getting a move on  him,\" he decided, estimating roughly the size of the tract which  that fence, when completed, would inclose. To be sure, it was pure  guesswork, for he was merely looking at one corner. Up the creek he  could not see, save a quarter mile or so to the next bend; even that  distance he could not see the dotted line--for he was looking upon a  level clothed with rank weeds and grass and small brush--but he knew  it must be there. When he turned his horse from the water and went his  way, his mind was no longer given up to idle dreaming of love words  and a girl. This fencing business concerned him intimately, and his  brain was as alert as his eyes. For he had not meant that Dilly should  fence any land just yet.    Farther up the creek he crossed, meaning to take another short cut and  so avoid a long detour; also, he wanted to see just where and how far  the fence went. Yes, the post holes were there, only here they held  posts leaning loosely this way and that like drunken men. A half mile  farther the wire was already strung, but not a man did he see whom he  might question--and when he glanced and saw that the sun was almost  straight over his head and that Barney's shadow scurried along nearly  beneath his stirrup, he knew that they would be stopping for  dinner. He climbed a hill and came plump upon a fence, wire-strung,  wire-stayed, aggressively barring his way.    \"Dilly's about the most thorough-minded man I ever met up with,\"  he mused, half annoyed, stopping a moment to survey critically the  barrier. \"Yuh never find a job uh hisn left with any loose ends  a-dangling. He's got a fence here like he was guarding a railroad  right-uh-way. I guess I'll go round, this trip.\"    At the ranch Charming Billy took the path that led to the kitchen,  because when he glanced that way from the stable he caught a flicker  of pink--a shade of pink which he liked very much, because Flora had  a dress of that color and it matched her cheeks, it seemed to him. She  had evidently not seen him, and he thought he would surprise her. To  that end, he suddenly stopped midway and removed his spurs lest their  clanking betray him. So he went on, with his eyes alight and the blood  of him jumping queerly.    Just outside the door he stopped, saw the pink flutter in the pantry  and went across the kitchen on his toes; sure, he was going to  surprise her a lot! Maybe, he thought daringly, he'd kiss her--if his  nerve stayed with him long enough. He rather thought it would. She was  stooping a little over the flour barrel, and her back was toward him.    More daring than he would have believed of himself, he reached out his  arms and caught her to him, and--It was not Flora at all. It was Mama  Joy.    \"Oh, I--I beg your pardon--I--\" stammered Billy helplessly.    \"Billy! You're a bad boy; how you frightened me!\" she gasped, and  showed an unmistakable inclination to snuggle.    Charming Billy, looking far more frightened than she, pulled himself  loose and backed away. Mama Joy looked at him, and there was that in  her eyes which sent a qualm of something very like disgust over Billy,  so that in his toes he felt the quiver.    \"It was an accident, Mrs. Bridger,\" he said laconically, and went out  hastily, leaving her standing there staring after him.    Outside, he twitched his shoulders as if he would still free himself  of something distasteful. \"Hell! What do I want with _her_?\" he  muttered indignantly, and did not stop to think where he was going  until he brought up at the stable. He had the reins of Barney in his  hand, and had put his foot in the stirrup before he quite came to  himself. \"Hell!\" he exploded again, and led Barney back into the  stall.    Charming Billy sat down on a box and began to build a smoke; his  fingers shook a great deal, so that he sifted out twice as much  tobacco as he needed. He felt utterly bewildered and ashamed and  sorry, and he could not think very clearly. He lighted the cigarette,  smoked it steadily, pinched out the stub and rolled another before he  came back to anything like calm.    Even when he could bring himself to face what had happened and what it  meant, he winced mentally away from the subject. He could still feel  the clinging pressure of her round, bare arms against his neck, and  he once more gave his shoulders a twitch. Three cigarettes he smoked,  staring at a warped board in the stall partition opposite him.    When the third was burned down to a very short stub he pinched out the  fire, dropped the stab to the dirt floor and deliberately set his foot  upon it, grinding it into the damp soil. It was as if he also set his  foot upon something else, so grimly intent was the look on his face.    \"Hell!\" he said for the third time, and drew a long breath. \"Well,  this has got to stop right here!\" He got up, took off his hat and  inspected it gravely, redimpled the crown, set it upon his head a  trifle farther back than usual, stuck his hands aggressively into his  pockets and went back to the house. This time he did not go to the  kitchen but around to the front porch, and he whistled shrilly the air  of his own pet ditty that his arrival might be heralded before him.    Later, when he was sitting at the table eating a hastily prepared  dinner with Mama Joy hovering near and seeming, to the raw nerves of  Billy, surrounded by an atmosphere of reproach and coy invitation, he  kept his eyes turned from her and ate rapidly that he might the sooner  quit her presence. Flora was out riding somewhere, she told him when  he asked. Dill came in and saved Billy from fleeing the place before  his hunger slept, and Billy felt justified in breathing easily and in  looking elsewhere than at his plate.    \"I see you've been getting busy with the barbwire,\" he remarked, when  he rose from the table and led the way out to the porch.    \"Why, no. I haven't done any fencing at all, William,\" Dill  disclaimed.    \"Yuh haven't? Who's been fencing up all Montana south uh the creek,  then?\" Billy turned, a cigarette paper fluttering in his fingers, and  eyed Dill intently.    \"I believe Mr. Brown is having some fencing done. Mr. Walland stopped  here to-day and said they were going to turn in a few head of cattle  as soon as the field was finished.\"    \"The dickens they are!\" Billy turned away and sought a patch of shade  where he might sit on the edge of the porch and dig his heels into the  soft dirt. He dug industriously while he turned the matter over in his  mind, then looked up a bit anxiously at Dill.    \"Say, Dilly, yuh fixed up that leasing business, didn't yuh?\" he  inquired. \"How much did yuh get hold of?\"    Dill, towering to the very eaves of the porch, gazed down solemnly  upon the other. \"I'm afraid you will think it bad news, William. I did  not lease an acre. I went, and I tried, but I discovered that others  had been there before me. As you would say, they beat me _to_ it. Mr.  Brown leased all the land obtainable, as long ago as last fall.\"    Billy did not even say a word. He merely snapped a match short off  between his thumb and forefinger and ground the pieces into the dirt  with his heel. Into the sunlight that had shone placidly upon the  castle he had builded in the air for Dill and for himself--yes, and  for one other--crept a shadow that for the moment dimmed the whole.    \"Say, Dilly, it's hell when things happen yuh haven't been looking for  and can't help,\" he said at last, smiling a little. \"I'd plumb got  my sights raised to having a big chunk uh Montana land under a  Double-Crank lease, but I reckon they can come down a notch. We'll  come out on top--don't yuh worry none about _that_.\"    \"I'm not worrying at all, William. I did not expect to have everything  come just as we wanted it; that, so far, has not been my experience in  business--or in love.\" The last two words, if one might judge from the  direction of his glance, were meant as pure sympathy.    Billy colored a little under the brown. \"The calf-crop is running  kinda short,\" he announced hurriedly. \"A lot uh cows died off last  winter, and I noticed a good many uh that young stock we shipped in  laid 'em down. I was hoping "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#19)"],[1,"in any way.    \"Why not?\" I asked. \"It's a cold night. There'll be frost if not  snow.\"    \"Shore you'll get 'em,\" said Jim.    \"There never was an Indian that didn't have 'em,\" added Jones.    \"What?\" I questioned.    They made mysterious signs that rather augmented my ignorance as to  what I might get from the Indian, but in no wise changed my mind. When  I went to bed I had to crawl over Navvy. Moze lay at my feet as usual  and he growled so deep that I could not but think he, too, resented  the addition to my small tent.    \"Mista Gay!\" came in the Indian's low voice.    \"Well Navvy?\" I asked.    \"Sleepie--sleepie?\"    \"Yes, Navvy, sleepy and tired. Are you?\"    \"Me savvy--mucha sleepie--mucha--no bueno.\"    I did not wonder at his feeling sleepy, tired and bad. He did not  awaken me in the morning, for when my eyes unclosed the tent was light  and he had gone. I found my companions up and doing.    We had breakfast and got into our saddles by the time the sun, a red  ball low down among the pines, began to brighten and turn to gold. No  snow had fallen but a thick frost encrusted the ground. The hounds,  wearing cloth moccasins, which plainly they detested, trotted in  front. Don showed no effects of his great run down the sliding slope  after the red lioness; it was one of his remarkable qualities that he  recuperated so quickly. Ranger was a little stiff, and Sounder favored  his injured foot. The others were as usual.    Jones led down the big hollow to which he kept after we had passed the  edge of the pines; then marking a herd of deer ahead, he turned his  horse up the bank.    We breasted the ridge and jogged toward the cedar forest, which we  entered without having seen the hounds show interest in anything.  Under the cedars in the soft yellow dust we crossed lion tracks, many  of them, but too old to carry a scent. Even North Hollow with its  regular beaten runway failed to win a murmur from the pack.    \"Spread out,\" said Jones, \"and look for tracks. I'll keep the center  and hold in the hounds.\"    Signalling occasionally to one another we crossed almost the breadth  of the cedar forest to its western end, where the open sage flats  inclined to the rim. In one of those flats I came upon a broken sage  bush, the grass being thick thereabout. I discovered no track but  dismounted and scrutinized the surroundings carefully. A heavy body  had been dragged across the sage, crushing it. The ends of broken  bushes were green, the leaves showed bruises.    I began to feel like Don when he scented game. Leading my mustang I  slowly proceeded across the open, guided by an occasional down-trodden  bush or tuft of grass. As I neared the cedars again Foxie snorted.  Under the first tree I found a ghastly bunch of red bones, a spread of  grayish hairs and a split skull. The bones, were yet wet; two long doe  ears were still warm. Then I saw big lion tracks in the dust and even  a well pressed imprint of a lion's body where he had rolled or lain.    The two yells I sent ringing into the forest were productive of  interesting results. Answers came from near and far. Then, what with  my calling and the replies, the forest rang so steadily with shrill  cries that the echoes had no chance to follow.    An elephant in the jungle could not have caused more crashing and  breaking of brush than did Emett as he made his way to me. He arrived  from the forest just as Jim galloped across the flat. Mutely I held up  the two long ears.    \"Get on your horse!\" cried Jim after one quick glance at the spread of  bones and hair.    It was well he said that, for I might have been left behind. I ran to  Foxie and vaulted upon him. A flash of yellow appeared among the sage  and a string of yelps split the air.    \"It's Don!\" yelled Jim.    Well we knew that. What a sight to see him running straight for us! He  passed, a savage yellow wolf in his ferocity, and disappeared like a  gleam under the gloomy cedars.    We spurred after him. The other hounds sped by. Jones closed in on us  from the left, and in a few minutes we were strung out behind Emett,  fighting the branches, dodging and swerving, hugging the saddle, and  always sending out our sharp yells.    The race was furious but short. The three of us coming up together  found Emett dismounted on the extreme end of West Point.    \"The hounds have gone down,\" he said, pointing to the runway.    We all listened to the meaning bays.    \"Shore they've got him up!\" asserted Jim. \"Like as not they found him  under the rim here, sleeping off his gorge. Now fellows, I'll go down.  It might be a good idea for you to spread along the rim.\"    [Illustration: TREED LION]    [Illustration: HIDING]    With that we turned our horses eastward and rode as close to the rim  as possible. Clumps of cedars and deep fissures often forced us to  circle them. The hounds, traveling under the walls below, kept pace  with us and then forged ahead, which fact caused Jones to dispatch  Emett on the gallop for the next runway at North Hollow.    Soon Jones bade me dismount and make my way out upon one of the  promontories, while he rode a little farther on. As I tied my mustang  I heard the hounds, faint and far beneath. I waded through the sage  and cedar to the rim.    Cape after cape jutted out over the abyss. Some were very sharp and  bare, others covered with cedar; some tottering crags with a crumbling  bridge leading to their rims; and some ran down like giant steps. From  one of these I watched below. The slope here under the wall was like  the side of a rugged mountain. Somewhere down among the dark patches  of cedar and the great blocks of stone the hounds were hunting the  lion, but I could not see one of them.    The promontory I had chosen had a split, and choked as this was with  brush, rock, and shale, it seemed a place where I might climb down.  Once started, I could not turn back, and sliding, clinging to what  afforded, I worked down the crack. A wall of stone hid the sky from  me part of the way. I came out a hundred feet below upon a second  promontory of huge slabs of yellow stone. Over these I clambered, to  sit with my feet swinging over the last one.    Straight before my gaze yawned the awful expanse of the canyon. In the  soft morning light the red mesas, the yellow walls, the black domes  were less harsh than in the full noonday sun, purer than in the tender  shadow of twilight. Below me were slopes and slides divided by ravines  full of stones as large as houses, with here and there a lonesome  leaning crag, giving irresistible proof of the downward trend, of the  rolling, weathering ruins of the rim. Above the wall bulged out full  of fissures, ragged and rotten shelves, toppling columns of yellow  limestone, beaded with quartz and colored by wild flowers wonderfully  growing in crannies.    Wild and rare as was this environment, I gave it but a glance and a  thought. The bay of the hounds caused me to bend sharp and eager eyes  to the open spaces of stone and slide below. Luck was mine as usual;  the hounds were working up toward me. How I strained my sight! Hearing  a single cry I looked eastward to see Jones silhouetted against the  blue on a black promontory. He seemed a giant primeval man overlooking  the ruin of a former world. I signalled him to make for my point.    Black Ranger hove in sight at the top of a yellow slide. He was at  fault but hunting hard. Jude and Sounder bayed off to his left. I  heard Don's clear voice, permeating the thin, cool air, seemingly  to leave a quality of wildness upon it; yet I could not locate him.  Ranger disappeared. Then for a time I only heard Jim. Moze was next to  appear and he, too, was upward bound. A jumble of stone hid him, and  then Ranger again showed. Evidently he wanted to get around the bottom  of a low crag, for he jumped and jumped only to fall back.    Quite naturally my eyes searched that crag. Stretched out upon the top  of it was the long, slender body of a lion.    \"Hi! hi! hi! hi! hi!\" I yelled till my lungs failed me.    \"Where are you?\" came from above.    \"Here! Here!\" I cried seeing Jones on the rim. \"Come down. Climb down  the crack. The lion is here; on top of that round crag. He's fooled  the hounds and they can't find him.\"    \"I see him! I see him!\" yelled Jones. Then he roared out a single call  for Emett that pealed like a clear clarion along the curved broken rim  wall, opening up echoes which clapped like thunder.    While Jones clattered down I turned again to the lion. He lay with  head hidden under a little shelf and he moved not a muscle. What a  place for him to choose! But for my accidental venturing down the  broken fragments and steps of the rim he could have remained safe from  pursuit.    Suddenly, right under my feet, Don opened his string of yelps. I could  not see him but decided he must be above the lion on the crag. I  leaned over as far as I dared. At that moment among the varied and  thrilling sounds about me I became vaguely aware of hard, panting  breaths, like coughs somewhere in my vicinity. As Jones had set in  motion bushels of stone and had already scraped his feet over the  rocks behind me I thought the forced respiration came from him. When  I turned he was yet far off--too far for me to hear him breathe. I  thought this circumstance strange but straightway forgot it.    On the moment from my right somewhere Don pealed out his bugle blast,  and immediately after Sounder and Jude joining him, sent up the thrice  welcome news of a treed lion.    \"There 're two! There 're two!\" I yelled to Jones, now working down to  my right.    \"He's treed down here. I've got him spotted!\" replied Jones. \"You stay  there and watch your lion. Yell for Emett.\"    Signal after signal for Emett earned no response, though Jim far below  to the left sent me an answer.    The next few minutes, or more likely half an hour, passed with Jones  and me separated from each other by a wall of"]]]
