Sir John Hepburn, with the Scots and the English  volunteers at the head of them, entered the town first, and cut all  the garrison to pieces, except such as escaped over the bridge.    I had no share in the business of Donauwerth, being now among the  horse, but I was posted on the roads with five troops of horse, where  we picked up a great many stragglers of the garrison, whom we made  prisoners of war.    'Tis observable that this town of Donauwerth is a very strong place  and well fortified, and yet such expedition did the king make, and  such resolution did he use in his first attacks, that he carried the  town without putting himself to the trouble of formal approaches.  'Twas generally his way when he came before any town with a design to  besiege it; he never would encamp at a distance and begin his trenches  a great way off, but bring his men immediately within half musket-shot  of the place; there getting under the best cover he could, he would  immediately begin his batteries and trenches before their faces;  and if there was any place possibly to be attacked, he would fall to  storming immediately. By this resolute way of coming on he carried  many a town in the first heat of his men, which would have held out  many days against a more regular siege.    This march of the king broke all Tilly's measures, for now he was  obliged to face about, and leaving the Upper Palatinate, to come  to the assistance of the Duke of Bavaria; for the king being 20,000  strong, besides 10,000 foot and 4000 horse and dragoons which joined  him from the Duringer Wald, was resolved to ruin the duke, who lay  now open to him, and was the most powerful and inveterate enemy of the  Protestants in the empire.    Tilly was now joined with the Duke of Bavaria, and might together make  about 22,000 men, and in order to keep the Swedes out of the country  of Bavaria, had planted themselves along the banks of the river Lech,  which runs on the edge of the duke's territories; and having fortified  the other side of the river, and planted his cannon for several miles  at all the convenient places on the river, resolved to dispute the  king's passage.    I shall be the longer in relating this account of the Lech, being  esteemed in those days as great an action as any battle or siege of  that age, and particularly famous for the disaster of the gallant old  General Tilly; and for that I can be more particular in it than other  accounts, having been an eye-witness to every part of it.    The king being truly informed of the disposition of the Bavarian army,  was once of the mind to have left the banks of the Lech, have repassed  the Danube, and so setting down before Ingolstadt, the duke's capital  city, by the taking that strong town to have made his entrance into  Bavaria, and the conquest of such a fortress, one entire action;  but the strength of the place and the difficulty of maintaining his  leaguer in an enemy's country while Tilly was so strong in the field,  diverted him from that design; he therefore concluded that Tilly  was first to be beaten out of the country, and then the siege of  Ingolstadt would be the easier.    Whereupon the king resolved to go and view the situation of the enemy.  His Majesty went out the 2nd of April with a strong party of horse,  which I had the honour to command. We marched as near as we could  to the banks of the river, not to be too much exposed to the enemy's  cannon, and having gained a little height, where the whole course of  the river might be seen, the king halted, and commanded to draw up.  The king alighted, and calling me to him, examined every reach and  turning of the river by his glass, but finding the river run a long  and almost a straight course he could find no place which he liked;  but at last turning himself north, and looking down the stream, he  found the river, stretching a long reach, doubles short upon itself,  making a round and very narrow point. \"There's a point will do our  business,\" says the king, \"and if the ground be good I'll pass there,  let Tilly do his worst.\"    He immediately ordered a small party of horse to view the ground, and  to bring him word particularly how high the bank was on each side and  at the point. \"And he shall have fifty dollars,\" says the king, \"that  will bring me word how deep the water is.\" I asked his Majesty leave  to let me go, which he would by no means allow of; but as the party  was drawing out, a sergeant of dragoons told the king, if he pleased  to let him go disguised as a boor, he would bring him an account of  everything he desired. The king liked the notion well enough, and  the fellow being very well acquainted with the country, puts on a  ploughman's habit, and went away immediately with a long pole upon  his shoulder. The horse lay all this while in the woods, and the  king stood undiscerned by the enemy on the little hill aforesaid. The  dragoon with his long pole comes down boldly to the bank of the river,  and calling to the sentinels which Tilly had placed on the other  bank, talked with them, asked them if they could not help him over the  river, and pretended he wanted to come to them. At last being come to  the point where, as I said, the river makes a short turn, he stands  parleying with them a great while, and sometimes, pretending to wade  over, he puts his long pole into the water, then finding it pretty  shallow he pulls off his hose and goes in, still thrusting his pole in  before him, till being gotten up to his middle, he could reach beyond  him, where it was too deep, and so shaking his head, comes back again.  The soldiers on the other side, laughing at him, asked him if he could  swim? He said, \"No,\" \"Why, you fool you,\" says one of the sentinels,  \"the channel of the river is twenty feet deep.\" \"How do you know  that?\" says the dragoon. \"Why, our engineer,\" says he, \"measured it  yesterday.\" This was what he wanted, but not yet fully satisfied,  \"Ay, but,\" says he, \"maybe it may not be very broad, and if one of you  would wade in to meet me till I could reach you with my pole, I'd give  him half a ducat to pull me over.\" The innocent way of his discourse  so deluded the soldiers, that one of them immediately strips and goes  in up to the shoulders, and our dragoon goes in on this side to meet  him; but the stream took t' other soldier away, and he being a good  swimmer, came swimming over to this side. The dragoon was then in a  great deal of pain for fear of being discovered, and was once going  to kill the fellow, and make off; but at last resolved to carry on the  humour, and having entertained the fellow with a tale of a tub, about  the Swedes stealing his oats, the fellow being a-cold wanted to be  gone, and he as willing to be rid of him, pretended to be very sorry  he could not get over the river, and so makes off.    By this, however, he learned both the depth and breadth of the  channel, the bottom and nature of both shores, and everything the king  wanted to know. We could see him from the hill by our glasses very  plain, and could see the soldier naked with him. Says the king, \"He  will certainly be discovered and knocked on the head from the other  side: he is a fool,\" says the king, \"he does not kill the fellow and  run off.\" But when the dragoon told his tale, the king was extremely  well satisfied with him, gave him a hundred dollars, and made him a  quartermaster to a troop of cuirassiers.    The king having farther examined the dragoon, he gave him a very  distinct account of the shore and the ground on this side, which he  found to be higher than the enemy's by ten or twelve foot, and a hard  gravel.    Hereupon the king resolves to pass there, and in order to it gives,  himself, particular directions for such a bridge as I believe never  army passed a river on before nor since.    His bridge was only loose planks laid upon large tressels in the same  homely manner as I have seen bricklayers raise a low scaffold to build  a brick wall; the tressels were made higher than one another to answer  to the river as it became deeper or shallower, and was all framed and  fitted before any appearance was made of attempting to pass.    When all was ready the king brings his army down to the bank of the  river, and plants his cannon as the enemy had done, some here and some  there, to amuse them.    At night, April 4th, the king commanded about 2000 men to march to  the point, and to throw up a trench on either side, and quite round  it with a battery of six pieces of cannon at each end, besides three  small mounts, one at the point and one of each side, which had each of  them two pieces upon them. This work was begun so briskly and so well  carried on, the king firing all the night from the other parts of  the river, that by daylight all the batteries at the new work were  mounted, the trench lined with 2000 musketeers, and all the utensils  of the bridge lay ready to be put together.    Now the Imperialists discovered the design, but it was too late  to hinder it; the musketeers in the great trench, and the five new  batteries, made such continual fire that the other bank, which, as  before, lay twelve feet below them, was too hot for the Imperialists;  whereupon Tilly, to be provided for the king at his coming over, falls  to work in a wood right against the point, and raises a great battery  for twenty pieces of cannon, with a breastwork or line, as near the  river as he could, to cover his men, thinking that when the king had  built his bridge he might easily beat it down with his cannon.    But the king had doubly prevented him, first by laying his bridge so  low that none of Tilly's shot could hurt it; for the bridge lay not  above half a foot above the water's edge, by which means the king, who  in that showed himself an excellent engineer, had secured it from  any batteries to be made within the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#19)"],[1," fundamental feeling, characterized by the contrast between  pleasure and pain, and in an impulse, springing from this fundamental  feeling, to movement and activity\"). It might be the creed of the  Neoidealism.    Hobhouse's discussion of mechanism in relation to teleology and to the  universal harmony and reality is fairly representative of the drift of  thought as set forth by recent English and French writers such as J. S.  Haldane, Oliver Lodge and some of the prominent biologists, and by Henri  Bergson:  \"An organic whole is therefore like a machine in being purposive,  though unlike it in that its purpose is within.\" \"A purposive process is one  determined by its tendency to produce a certain result, purpose itself being  an act [sic] determined in its character by that which it tends to bring  about.  As such it differs fundamentally from a mechanical cause.\"  \"The  empirical and philosophical arguments point to the same general conclusion,  that reality is the process of the development of Mind.\"  As a guide to  one's thinking, and as integrators of one's subconscious intuitions and  resultants, such concise formulae certainly have much value, especially  when, as here, clearly and ably expounded in the text proper.

THE JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY    ANGER AS A PRIMARY EMOTION, AND THE APPLICATION OF FREUDIAN MECHANISMS TO  ITS PHENOMENA[*]    [*] Read at a meeting of the American Psychopathological Association, New  York City, May 5, 1915.    BY G. STANLEY HALL    THE exact sciences consist of a body of truth which all accept, and to which  all experts strive to contribute.  Philosophy, however, like religion, has  always been broken into sects, schools or parties, and the body of truth  which all accept in these fields is relatively far less, and the  antagonistic views far greater. Normal psychology, which a few decades ago,  started out to be scientific with the good old ideal of a body of truth  semper ubique et ad omnibus, is already splitting into introspectionists,  behaviorists, genetic, philosophical and other groups, while in the new  Freudian movement, Adler and Jung are becoming sectaries, the former drawing  upon himself the most impolitic and almost vituperative condemnation of the  father of psychoanalysis. With this latter schism we are not here concerned,  but we are deeply concerned with the more general relations between the  psychologists of the normal and those of the abnormal; with a very few  negligible exceptions psychoanalysis has hardly ever had a place on the  program of our American Psychological Association, and the normal has had  little representation in your meetings and publications. This I deem  unfortunate for both, for unsatisfactory as this sadly needed rapprochement  is on the continent, it is far more so here. That the normalists in this  country so persistently ignore the unique opportunity to extend their  purview into the psychopathological domain at the unique psychological  moment that the development of Freudianism has offered, is to me a matter of  sad disappointment and almost depression. In reading a plea for Freud in our  association of normalists, I am a vox clamantis in deserto and can evoke no  response, and even the incursions of psychoanalysis into the domain of  biography, myth, religion and dreams, have not evoked a single attempt at  appreciation or criticism worthy of mention by any American psychologist of  the normal.  I have sought in various ways the causes of this reticence, not  to say ignorance. While I received various answers, the chief one was to the  effect that the alleged hypertrophy of sex in its gross pathological forms,  and the conviction of the kind and degree of sex consciousness found in the  many hundreds of analyzed cases, are so unique and constitute the very  essence of the neurotic and psychotic cases, and conscious and unconscious  sex factors are slight or absent in most normal cases, that these patients  and their doctors alike are sex-intoxicated, and that the Freudian  psychology applies only to perverts and erotomania or other abnormal cases.  To ascribe all this aversion to social or ethical repression is both shallow  and banousic, for the real causes are both manifold and deeper.  They are  part of a complicated protest of normality, found in all and even in the  resistance of subjects of analysis, which is really a factor which is basal  for self-control of the varying good sides of which Freudians tell us  nothing. The fact is that there are other things in the human psyche than  sex, and its ramifications.  Hunger, despite Jung, fear despite Sadger, and  anger despite Freud, are just as primary, aboriginal and independent as sex,  and we fly in the face of fact and psychic experience to derive them all  from sex, although it is freely granted that in morbid cases each may take  on predominant sex features. In what follows I can only very briefly hint at  the way in which some of the Freudian mechanisms are applied to one of the  emotions, viz., anger.    Anger in most of its forms is the most dynamogenic of all the emotions. In  paroxysms of rage with abandon we stop at nothing short of death and even  mutilation.  The Malay running amuck, Orlando Furioso, the epic of the wrath  of Achilles, hell-fire, which is an expression of divine wrath, are some  illustrations of its power.  Savages work themselves into frenzied rage in  order to fight their enemies. In many descriptions of its brutal aspects,  which I have collected, children and older human brutes spit, hiss, yell,  snarl, bite noses and ears, scratch, gouge out eyes, pull hair, mutilate sex  organs, with a violence that sometimes takes on epileptic features and which  in a number of recorded cases causes sudden death at its acme, from the  strain it imposes upon the system. Its cause is always some form of  thwarting wish or will or of reduction of self-feeling, as anger is the acme  of self-assertion. The German criminalist, Friedrich, says that probably  every man might be caused to commit murder if provocation were sufficient,  and that those of us who have never committed this crime owe it to  circumstances and not to superior power of inhibition. Of course it may be  associated with sex but probably no human experience is per se more  diametrically opposite to sex. Some temperaments seem to crave, if not need,  outbreaks of it at certain intervals, like a well-poised lady, so  sweet-tempered that everybody imposed on her, till one day at the age of  twenty-three she had her first ebullition of temper end went about to her  college mates telling them plainly what she thought of them, and went home  rested and happy, full of the peace that passeth understanding. Otto Heinze,  and by implication Pfister, think nations that have too long or too  assiduously cultivated peace must inevitably sooner or later relapse to the  barbarisms of war to vent their instincts for combat, and Crile thinks anger  most sthenic, while Cannon says it is the emotion into which most others  tend to pass. It has of course been a mighty agent in evolution, for those  who can summate all their energies in attack have survived. But few if any  impulsions of man, certainly not sex, have suffered more intense, prolonged  or manifold repressions.  Courts and law have taken vengeance into their  hands or tried to, and not only a large proportion of assaults, but other  crimes, are still due to explosions of temper, and it may be a factor in  nearly every court case. Society frowns on it, and Lord Chesterfield says  the one sure and unfailing mark of a gentleman is that he never shows  temper. Its manifestations are severely tabooed in home and school. Religion  teaches us not to let the sun go down upon our wrath and even to turn the  other cheek, so that we go through life chronically afraid that we shall  break out, let ourselves go, or get thoroughly mad, so that the moment we  begin to feel a rising tide of indignation or resentment (in the  nomenclature of which our language is so very rich, Chamberlain having  collected scores of English expressions of it), the censorship begins to  check it. In many cases in our returns repression is so potent from long  practice, that the sweetest smile, the kindest remarks or even deeds are  used either to veil it to others, or to evict it from our own consciousness,  or else as a self-inflicted penance for feeling it, while in some tender  consciences its checked but persistent vestiges may become centers of morbid  complexes and in yet other cases it burrows and proliferates more or less  unconsciously, and finds secret and circuitous ways of indulgence which only  psychoanalysis or a moral or religious confessional could trace.    I. Anger has many modes of Verschiebung, both instinctive and cultivated.  One case in our returns carries a bit of wood in his vest-pocket and bites  it when he begins to feel the aura of temper."]]]
