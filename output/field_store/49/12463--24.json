It is said the publishers made on the \"Wanderer\" alone, up to  the year 1861, a sum of about five thousand five hundred dollars. It  is true that \"everything he touched turned to music,\" as Schumann once  said of him. The hours of sleep were more and more curtailed, for he  wrote late at night and rose early the next day. It is even said he  slept in his spectacles, to save the trouble and time of putting them  on in the morning.    In Schubert's boyhood, the music of Mozart influenced him most. This  is seen in his earlier compositions. Beethoven was a great master  to him then, but as time went on the spell of his music always grew  stronger. In 1822, he wrote and published a set of variations on a  French air, and dedicated them to Beethoven. He greatly desired to  present them in person to the master he adored, but was too shy to go  alone. Diabelli, the publisher, finally went with him. Beethoven was  courteous but formal, pushing paper and pencil toward his guest, as he  was totally deaf. Schubert was too shy to write a single word.  However he produced his Variations. Beethoven seemed pleased with the  dedication, and looked through the music. Soon he found something in  it he did not approve of and pointed it out. The young author, losing  his presence of mind, fled from the house. But Beethoven really liked  the music and often played it to his nephew.    Five years later, during his last illness, a collection of some sixty  of Schubert's songs was placed in his hands. He turned them over and  over with amazement and delight. \"Truly Schubert has the divine fire,\"  he exclaimed. He wanted to see the composer of such beautiful music.  Schubert came and was allowed to have a talk with him first, before  other friends who were waiting. When Schubert paid another visit to  the bedside of the master, it was almost the end of his life, though  he could recognize all who stood about him. Overcome with emotion,  Schubert left the room.    A couple of weeks after this Schubert was one of the torch bearers who  accompanied the great master to the last resting place. Little did the  young man of thirty dream that he would soon follow after. His life at  this time was full of disappointments. He had always longed to write  for the lyric stage. He composed numerous operas; but they were always  rejected, for one reason or another. The last, \"Fierabras,\" which was  on the point of being produced, was finally given up. The composer  became very dejected, and believed himself to be the most unfortunate,  the most miserable being on earth. But, fortunately for Schubert,  his cheerfulness again asserted itself and the stream of production  resumed its flow. With his temperament, at one moment he would be  utterly despairing, the next his troubles would seem to be forgotten,  and he would be writing a song, a symphony or a sonata. At all  events, constant work filled his days. The last year of his life was  productive of some of his finest works.    About the end of October, 1828, he began to show signs of a serious  breakdown. He was living at the home of his brother Ferdinand, in one  of the suburbs of the city. Although he revived a little during  the early part of November, so that he could resume walks in the  neighborhood, the weakness increased, and eleven days passed without  food or drink. Lingering till the nineteenth of November, he passed  peacefully away, still in his early manhood. The old father, the  schoolmaster at the old home, hoped to have his son buried in the  little cemetery near by. But Ferdinand knew his brother's wish, to be  placed near Beethoven in Waehringer Cemetery. The monument, erected by  his friends and admirers the following year, bears, above the name,  this inscription:        \"Music has here entombed a rich treasure, but much fairer      hopes.\"          X    FELIX MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY      Mendelssohn has often been named \"Felix the Happy,\" and he truly  deserved the title. Blest with a most cheerful disposition, with the  power to make friends of every one he met, and wherever he went, the  son of a rich banker, surrounded with everything that wealth could  give, it was indeed no wonder that Felix Mendelssohn was happy. He did  not have to struggle with poverty and privation as most of the  other great musicians were forced to do. Their music was often the  expression of struggle and sorrow. He had none of these things to  bear; he was carefree and happy, and his music reflects the joyous  contentment of his life.    The Mendelssohn family originally lived in Hamburg. Their house faced  one of the fine squares of the city, with a handsome church on  the opposite side. The building is still there and well preserved,  although the principal story is used as public dining rooms. A large  tablet has been placed above the doorway, with a likeness of the  composer encircled by a wreath of laurel. Here little Felix was born,  February 3, 1809. There were other children, Fanny a year or two  older, then after Felix came Rebekka and little Paul. When French  soldiers occupied the town in 1811, life became very unpleasant for  the German residents, and whoever could, sought refuge in other cities  and towns. Among those who successfully made their escape was the  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy family, the second name belonged to the family  and was used to distinguish their own from other branches of the  Mendelssohn family. With his wife and children, Abraham Mendelssohn  fled to Berlin, and made his home for some years with the grandmother,  who had a house on the Neue Promenade, a fine broad street, with  houses only on one side, the opposite side descended in a grassy slope  to the canal, which flowed lazily by.    It was a happy life the children led, amid ideal surroundings. Felix  very early showed a great fondness for music, and everything was done  to foster his budding talent. With his sister Fanny, to whom he was  devotedly attached, he began to have short music lessons from  his mother when he was only four years old. Their progress was so  satisfactory, that after a while, professional musicians were engaged  to teach them piano, violin and composition, as a regular part of  their education. Besides these, they must study Greek, Latin, drawing  and school subjects. With so much study to be done each day, it was  necessary to begin work at five o'clock in the morning. But in spite  of hard work all were happy, and as for Felix nothing could dampen the  flow of his high spirits; he enjoyed equally work and play, giving the  same earnest attention to each. Both he and Fanny were beginning  to compose, and Felix's attempts at improvising upon some comical  incident in their play time would call forth peals of laughter from  the inseparable children.    Soon more ambitious attempts at composition were made, the aim being  to write little operas. But unless they could be performed, it was  useless to try and make operas. This was a serious difficulty; but  Felix was deeply in earnest in whatever he undertook, and decided he  must have an orchestra to try out his operatic efforts. It looked like  an impossibility, but love and money can accomplish wonders. A small  orchestra was duly selected from among the members of the Court band.  The lad Felix was to conduct these sedate musicians, which he did  modestly but without embarrassment, standing on a footstool before  his men, waving the baton like a little general. Before the first  performance was quite ready, Felix felt there must be some one present  who could really judge of the merits of his little piece. Who would  do so better than his old professor of thorough bass and composition,  Carl Zelter, the director of the Berlin Singakademie. Zelter agreed  to accept this delicate office, and a large number of friends were  invited for the occasion.    This was only the beginning of a series of weekly musical evenings at  the Mendelssohn home. Felix, with his dark curls, his shining eyes,  and charming manners, was the life of anything he undertook. He  often conducted his little pieces, but did not monopolize the time.  Sometimes all four children took part, Fanny at the piano, Rebekka  singing, Paul playing the 'cello and Felix at the desk. Old Zelter was  generally present, and though averse to praising pupils, would often  say a few words of encouragement at the close.    Felix was at this time but little more than twelve years old. He had  within the last year composed fifty or sixty pieces, including a trio  for piano and strings, containing three movements, several sonatas for  the piano, some songs and a musical comedy in three scenes, for  piano and voices. All these were written with the greatest care and  precision, and with the date of each neatly added. He collected his  pieces into volumes; and the more work he did the more neatly he  wrote.    The boy Felix had a wonderful gift for making friends. One day he  suddenly caught sight of Carl Maria von Weber walking along the  streets of Berlin, near his home. He recognized the famous composer at  once, as he had lately visited his parents. The boy's dark eyes glowed  with pleasure at the recognition, and tossing back his curls, he  sprang forward and threw his arms about Weber's neck, begging him to  go home with him. When the astonished musician recovered himself, he  presented the boy to Jules Benedict, his young friend and pupil who  walked at his side, saying, \"This is Felix Mendelssohn.\" For response  Felix, with a bright look, seized the young man's hand in both his  own. Weber stood by smiling at the boy's enthusiasm. Again Felix  besought them to come home with him, but Weber had to attend a  rehearsal. \"Is it for the opera?\" the boy cried excitedly.    \"Yes,\" answered the composer.    \"Does he know all about it?\" asked Felix, pointing to Benedict.    \"Indeed he does,\" answered the composer laughing, \"or if he doesn't he  ought to for he has been bored"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#19)"],[1,"of its enemy, man? One instance  has certainly been attested to me by an eye-witness, in which the trunk  of an elephant was seized in the teeth of a Scotch terrier, and such was  the alarm of the huge creature that it came at once to its knees. The  dog repeated the attack, and on every renewal of it the elephant  retreated in terror, holding its trunk above its head, and kicking at  the terrier with its fore feet. It would have turned to flight, but for  the interference of its keeper.    [Footnote 1: To account for the impatience manifested by the elephant at  the presence of a dog, it has been suggested that he is alarmed lest the  latter should attack _his feet_, a portion of his body of which the  elephant is peculiarly careful. A tame elephant has been observed to  regard with indifference a spear directed towards his head, but to  shrink timidly from the same weapon when pointed at his foot.]    Major Skinner, formerly commissioner of roads in Ceylon, whose official  duties in constructing highways involved the necessity of his being in  the jungle for months together, always found that, by night or by day,  the barking of a dog which accompanied him, was sufficient to put a herd  to flight. On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that the elephant  lives on terms of amity with every quadruped in the forest, that it  neither regards them as its foes, nor provokes their hostility by its  acts; and that, with the exception of man, _its greatest enemy is a  fly_!    The current statements as to the supposed animosity of the elephant to  minor animals originated with AElian and Pliny, who had probably an  opportunity of seeing, what may at any time be observed, that when a  captive elephant is picketed beside a post, the domestic animals, goats,  sheep, and cattle, will annoy and irritate him by their audacity in  making free with his provender; but this is an evidence in itself of the  little instinctive dread which such comparatively puny creatures  entertain of one so powerful and yet so gentle.    Amongst elephants themselves, jealousy and other causes of irritation  frequently occasion contentions between individuals of the same herd;  but on such occasions it is their habit to strike with their trunks, and  to bear down their opponents with their heads. It is doubtless correct  that an elephant, when prostrated by the force and fury of an antagonist  of its own species, is often wounded by the downward pressure of the  tusks, which in any other position it would be almost impossible to use  offensively.[1]    [Footnote 1: A writer in the _India Sporting Review_ for October 1857  says a male elephant was killed by two others close to his camp: \"the  head was completely smashed in; there was a large hole in the side, and  the abdomen was ripped open. The latter wound was given probably after  it had fallen.\"--P. 175.]    Mr. Mercer, who in 1846 was the principal civil officer of Government at  Badulla, sent me a jagged fragment of an elephant's tusk, about five  inches in diameter, and weighing between twenty and thirty pounds, which  had been brought to him by some natives, who, being attracted by a noise  in the jungle, witnessed a combat between a tusker and one without  tusks, and saw the latter with his trunk seize one of the tusks of his  antagonist and wrench from it the portion in question, which measured  two feet in length.    Here the trunk was shown to be the more powerful offensive weapon of the  two; but I apprehend that the chief reliance of the elephant for defence  is on its ponderous weight, the pressure of its foot being sufficient to  crush any minor assailant after being prostrated by means of its trunk.  Besides, in using its feet for this purpose, it derives a wonderful  facility from the peculiar formation of the knee-joint in the hind leg,  which, enabling it to swing the hind feet forward close to the ground,  assists it to toss the body alternately from foot to foot, till deprived  of life.[1]    [Footnote 1: In the Third Book of Maccabees, which is not printed in our  Apocrypha, but appears in the series in the Greek Septuagint, the  author, in describing the persecution of the Jews by Ptolemy Philopater,  B.C. 210, states that the king swore vehemently that he would send them  into the other world, \"foully trampled to death by the knees and feet of  elephants\" ([Greek: pempsein eis haden en gonasi kai posi therion  hekismenous.] 3 Mac. v. 42). AELIAN makes the remark, that elephants on  such occasions use their _knees_ as well as their feet to crush their  victims.--_Hist Anim._ viii. 10.]    A sportsman who had partially undergone this operation, having been  seized by a wounded elephant but rescued from its fury, described to me  his sufferings as he was thus flung back and forward between the hind  and fore feet of the animal, which ineffectually attempted to trample  him at each concussion, and abandoned him without inflicting serious  injury.    KNOX, in describing the execution of criminals by the state elephants of  the former kings of Kandy, says, \"they will run their teeth (_tusks_)  through the body, and then tear it in pieces and throw it limb from  limb;\" but a Kandyan chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured  me that the elephant never once applied its tusks, but, placing its foot  on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden  movement of the trunk. If the tusks were designed to be employed  offensively, some alertness would naturally be exhibited in using them;  but in numerous instances where sportsmen have fallen into the power of  a wounded elephant, they have escaped through the failure of the enraged  animal to strike them with its tusks, even when stretched upon the  ground.[1]    [Footnote 1: The _Hastisilpe_, a Singhalese work which treats of the  \"Science of Elephants,\" enumerates amongst those which it is not  desirable to possess, \"the elephant which will fight with a stone or a  stick in his trunk.\"]    Placed as the elephant is in Ceylon, in the midst of the most luxuriant  profusion of its favourite food, in close proximity at all times to  abundant supplies of water, and with no enemies against whom to protect  itself, it is difficult to conjecture any probable utility which it  could derive from such appendages. Their absence is unaccompanied by any  inconvenience to the individuals in whom they are wanting; and as  regards the few who possess them, the only operations in which I am  aware of their tusks being employed in relation to the oeconomy of the  animal, is to assist in ripping open the stem of the jaggery palms and  young palmyras to extract the farinaceous core; and in splitting the  juicy shaft of the plantain. Whilst the tuskless elephant crushes the  latter under foot, thereby soiling it and wasting its moisture; the  other, by opening it with the point of his tusk, performs the operation  with delicacy and apparent ease.    These, however, are trivial and almost accidental advantages: on the  other hand, owing to irregularities in their growth, the tusks are  sometimes an impediment in feeding[1]; and in more than one instance in  the Government studs, tusks which had so grown as to approach and cross  one another at the extremities, have had to be removed by the saw; the  contraction of space between them so impeding the free action of the  trunk as to prevent the animal from conveying branches to its mouth.[2]    [Footnote 1: Among other eccentric forms, an elephant was seen in 1844,  in the district of Bintenne, near Friar's-Hood Mountain, one of whose  tusks was so bent that it took what sailors term a \"round turn,\" and  resumed its curved direction as before. In the Museum of the College of  Surgeons, London, there is a specimen, No. 2757, of a _spira_ tusk.]    [Footnote 2: Since the foregoing remarks were written relative to the  undefined use of tusks to the elephant, I have seen a speculation on the  same subject in Dr. HOLLAND'S \"_Constitution of the Animal Creation, as  expressed in structural Appendages_;\" but the conjecture of the author  leaves the problem scarcely less obscure than before. Struck with the  mere _supplemental_ presence of the tusks, the absence of all apparent  use serving to distinguish them from the essential organs of the  creature, Dr. HOLLAND concludes that their production is a process  incident, but not ancillary, to other important ends, especially  connected with the vital functions of the trunk and the marvellous  motive powers inherent to it; his conjecture is, that they are \"a  species of safety valve of the animal oeconomy,\"--and that \"they owe  their development to the predominance of the senses of touch and smell,  conjointly with the muscular motions of which the exercise of these is  accompanied.\" \"Had there been no proboscis,\" he thinks, \"there would  have been no supplementary appendages,--the former creates the  latter.\"--Pp. 246, 271.]    It is true that in captivity, and after a due course of training, the  elephant discovers a new use for its tusks when employed in moving  stones and piling timber; so much so that a powerful one will raise and  carry on them a log of half a ton weight or more. One evening, whilst  riding in the vicinity of Kandy, towards the scene of the massacre of  Major Davie's party in 1803, my horse evinced some excitement at a noise  which approached us in the thick jungle, and which consisted of a  repetition of the ejaculation _urmph! urmph!_ in a hoarse and  dissatisfied tone. A turn in the forest explained the mystery, by  bringing me face to face with a tame elephant, unaccompanied by any  attendant. He was labouring painfully to carry a heavy beam of timber,  which he balanced across his tusks, but the pathway being narrow, he was  forced to bend his head to one side to permit it to pass endways; and  the exertion and this inconvenience combined led him to utter the  dissatisfied sounds which disturbed"]]]
