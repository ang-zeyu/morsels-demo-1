It speedily superseded all previous  books as a complete statement and judicious discussion of sexual  inversion. Moll was not content merely to present fresh clinical material.  He attacked the problem which had now become of primary importance: the  nature and causes of sexual inversion. He discussed the phenomena as a  psychologist even more than as a physician, bearing in mind the broader  aspects of the problem, keenly critical of accepted opinions, but  judiciously cautious in the statement of conclusions. He cleared away  various ancient prejudices and superstitions which even Krafft-Ebing  sometimes incautiously repeated. He accepted the generally received  doctrine that the sexually inverted usually belong to families in which  various nervous and mental disorders prevail, but he pointed out at the  same time that it is not in all cases possible to prove that we are  concerned with individuals possessing a hereditary neurotic taint. He also  rejected any minute classification of sexual inverts, only recognizing  psycho-sexual hermaphroditism and homosexuality. At the same time he cast  doubt on the existence of acquired homosexuality, in a strict sense,  except in occasional cases, and he pointed out that even when a normal  heterosexual impulse appears at puberty, and a homosexual impulse later,  it may still be the former that was acquired and the latter that was  inborn.    In America attention had been given to the phenomena at a fairly early  period. Mention may be specially made of J.G. Kiernan and G. Frank  Lydston, both of whom put forward convenient classifications of homosexual  manifestations some thirty years ago.[122] More recently (1911) an  American writer, under the pseudonym of Xavier Mayne, privately printed an  extensive work entitled _The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as  a Problem in Social Life_, popularly written and compiled from many  sources. This book, from a subjective and scarcely scientific standpoint,  claims that homosexual relationships are natural, necessary, and  legitimate.[123]    In England the first attempts to deal seriously, from the modern point of  view, with the problem of homosexuality came late, and were either  published privately or abroad. In 1883 John Addington Symonds privately  printed his discussion of _paiderastia_ in ancient Greece, under the title  of _A Problem in Greek Ethics_, and in 1889-1890 he further wrote, and in  1891 privately printed, _A Problem of Modern Ethics: Being an Enquiry into  the Phenomena of Sexual Inversion_. In 1886 Sir Richard Burton added to  his translation of the _Arabian Nights_ a Terminal Essay on the same  subject. In 1894 Edward Carpenter privately printed in Manchester a  pamphlet entitled _Homogenic Love_, in which he criticised various  psychiatric views of inversion at that time current, and claimed that the  laws of homosexual love are the same as those of heterosexual love,  urging, however, that the former possesses a special aptitude to be  exalted to a higher and more spiritual level of comradeship, so fulfilling  a beneficent social function. More recently (1907) Edward Carpenter  published a volume of papers on homosexuality and its problems, under the  title of _The Intermediate Sex_, and later (1914) a more special study of  the invert in early religion and in warfare, _Intermediate Types among  Primitive Folk_.    In 1896 the most comprehensive book so far written on the subject in  England was published in French by Mr. Andre Raffalovich (in Lacassagne's  _Bibliotheque de Criminologie_), _Uranisme et Unisexualite_. This book  dealt chiefly with congenital inversion, publishing no new cases, but  revealing a wide knowledge of the matter. Raffalovich put forward many  just and sagacious reflections on the nature and treatment of inversion,  and the attitude of society toward perverted sexuality. The historical  portions of the book, which are of special interest, deal largely with the  remarkable prevalence of inversion in England, neglected by previous  investigators. Raffalovich, whose attitude is, on the whole, philosophical  rather than scientific, regards congenital inversion as a large and  inevitable factor in human life, but, taking the Catholic standpoint, he  condemns all sexuality, either heterosexual or homosexual, and urges the  invert to restrain the physical manifestations of his instinct and to aim  at an ideal of chastity. On the whole, it may be said that the book is the  work of a thinker who has reached his own results in his own way, and  those results bear an imprint of originality and freedom from tradition.    In recent years no one has so largely contributed to place our knowledge  of sexual inversion on a broad and accurate basis as Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld  of Berlin, who possesses an unequalled acquaintance with the phenomena of  homosexuality in all their aspects. He has studied the matter exhaustively  in Germany and to some extent in other countries also; he has received the  histories of a thousand inverts; he is said to have met over ten thousand  homosexual persons. As editor of the _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle  Zwischenstufen_, which he established in 1899, and author of various  important monographs--more especially on transitional psychic and physical  stages between masculinity and femininity--Hirschfeld had already  contributed greatly to the progress of investigation in this field before  the appearance in 1914 of his great work, _Die Homosexualitaet des Mannes  und des Weibes_. This is not only the largest but the most precise,  detailed, and comprehensive--even the most condensed--work which has yet  appeared on the subject. It is, indeed, an encyclopedia of homosexuality.  For such a task Hirschfeld had been prepared by many years of strenuous  activity as a physician, an investigator, a medico-legal expert before the  courts, and his position as president of the _Wissenschaftlich-humanitaeren  Komitee_ which is concerned with the defense of the interests of the  homosexual in Germany. In Hirschfeld's book the pathological conception  of inversion has entirely disappeared; homosexuality is regarded as  primarily a biological phenomenon of universal extension, and secondarily  as a social phenomenon of serious importance. There is no attempt to  invent new theories; the main value of Hirschfeld's work lies, indeed, in  the constant endeavor to keep close to definite facts. It is this quality  which renders the book an indispensable source for all who seek  enlightened and precise information on this question.    Even the existence of such a treatise as this of Hirschfeld's is enough to  show how rapidly the study of this subject has grown. A few years ago--for  instance, when Dr. Paul Moreau wrote his _Aberrations du Sens  Genesique_--sexual inversion was scarcely even a name. It was a loathsome  and nameless vice, only to be touched with a pair of tongs, rapidly and  with precautions. As it now presents itself, it is a psychological and  medico-legal problem so full of interest that we need not fear to face it,  and so full of grave social actuality that we are bound to face it.      FOOTNOTES:    [113] In England aberration of the sexual instinct, or the tendency of men  to feminine occupations and of women to masculine occupations, had been  referred to in the _Medical Times and Gazette_, February 9, 1867; Sir G.  Savage first described a case of \"Sexual Perversion\" in the _Journal of  Mental Science_, vol. xxx, October, 1884.    [114] Moritz, _Magazin fuer Erfahrungsseelenkunde_, Berlin, Bd. viii.    [115] A full and interesting account of Hoessli and his book is given by  Karsch in the _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, Bd. v, 1903, pp.  449-556.    [116] \"Eugen Duehren\" (Iwan Bloch) remarks, however (_Neue Forschungen ueber  den Marquis de Sade und seine Zeit_, p. 436), that de Sade in his _Aline  et Valcour_ seems to recognize that inversion is sometimes inborn, or at  least natural, and apt to develop at a very early age, in spite of all  provocations to the normal attitude. \"And if this inclination were not  natural,\" he makes Sarmiento say, \"would the impression of it be received  in childhood?... Let us study better this indulgent Nature before daring  to fix her limits.\" Still earlier, in 1676 (as Schouten has pointed out,  _Sexual-Probleme_, January, 1910, p. 66), an Italian priest called  Carretto recognized that homosexual tendencies are innate.

[119] Ulrichs scarcely went so far as to assert that both homosexual and  heterosexual love are equally normal and healthy; this has, however, been  argued more recently.    [120] Special mention may be made of _L'Inversion Sexuelle_, a copious and  comprehensive, though sometimes uncritical book by Dr. J. Chevalier,  published in 1893, and the _Perversion et Perversite Sexuelles_ of Dr.  Saint-Paul, writing under the pseudonym of \"Dr. Laupts,\" published in 1896  and republished in an enlarged form, under the title of _L'Homosexualite  et les Types Homosexuels_, in 1910.    [121] Krafft-Ebing set forth his latest views in a paper read before the  International Medical Congress, at Paris, in 1900 (_Comptes-rendus_,  \"Section de Psychiatrie,\" pp. 421, 462; also in contributions to the  _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, Bd. iii, 1901).

As Crawley, who has brought out this point, puts it,  \"Marriage-rites of union are essentially identical with love charms,\" and  he refers in illustration to the custom of the Australian Arunta, among  whom the man or woman by making music on the bull-roarer compels a person  of the opposite sex to court him or her, the marriage being thus  completed. (E. Crawley, _The Mystic Rose_, p. 318.)    [34] The more carefully animals are observed, the more often this is found  to be the case, even with respect to species which possess no obvious and  elaborate process for obtaining tumescence. See, for instance, the  detailed and very instructive account--too long to quote here--given by E.  Selous of the preliminaries to intercourse practised by a pair of great  crested grebes, while nest-building. Intercourse only took place with much  difficulty, after many fruitless invitations, more usually given by the  female. (\"Observational Diary of the Habits of the Great Crested Grebe,\"  _Zoeologist_, September, 1901.) It is exactly the same with savages. The  observation of Foley (_Bulletin de la Societe d'Anthropologie de Paris_,  November 6, 1879) that in savages \"sexual erethism is very difficult\" is  of great significance and certainly in accordance with the facts. This  difficulty of erethism is the real cause of many savage practices which to  the civilized person often seem perverse; the women of the Caroline  Islands, for instance, as described by Finsch, require the tongue or even  the teeth to be applied to the clitoris, or a great ant to be applied to  bite the parts, in order to stimulate orgasm. Westermarck, after quoting a  remark of Mariner's concerning the women of Tonga,--\"it must not be  supposed that these women are always easily won; the greatest attentions  and the most fervent solicitations are sometimes requisite, even though  there be no other lover in the way,\"--adds that these words \"hold true for  a great many, not to say all, savage and barbarous races now existing.\"  (_Human Marriage_, p. 163.) The old notions, however, as to the sexual  licentiousness of peoples living in natural conditions have scarcely yet  disappeared. See Appendix A; \"The Sexual Instinct in Savages.\"    [35] In men a certain degree of tumescence is essential before coitus can  be effected at all; in women, though tumescence is not essential to  coitus, it is essential to orgasm and the accompanying physical and  psychic relief. The preference which women often experience for prolonged  coitus is not, as might possibly be imagined, due to sensuality, but has a  profound physiological basis.    [36] Stanley Hall, _Adolescence_, vol. i, p. 223.    [37] See Lagrange's _Physiology of Bodily Exercise_, especially chapter  ii. It is a significant fact that, as Sergi remarks (_Les Emotions_, p.  330), the physiological results of dancing are identical with the  physiological results of pleasure.    [38] Groos, _Spiele der Menschen_, p. 112. Zmigrodzki (_Die Mutter bei den  Volkern des Arischen Stammes_, p. 414 et seq.) has an interesting passage  describing the dance--especially the Russian dance--in its orgiastic  aspects.    [39] Fere, \"L'Influence sur le Travail Volontaire d'un muscle de  l'activite d'autres muscles,\" _Nouvelles Iconographie de la Salpetriere_,  1901.    [40] \"The sensation of motion,\" Kline remarks (\"The Migratory Impulse,\"  _American Journal of Psychology_, October, 1898, p. 62), \"as yet but  little studied from a pleasure-pain standpoint, is undoubtedly a  pleasure-giving sensation. For Aristippus the end of life is pleasure,  which he defines as gentle motion. Motherhood long ago discovered its  virtue as furnished by the cradle. Galloping to town on the parental knee  is a pleasing pastime in every nursery. The several varieties of swings,  the hammock, see-saw, flying-jenny, merry-go-round, shooting the chutes,  sailing, coasting, rowing, and skating, together with the fondness of  children for rotating rapidly in one spot until dizzy and for jumping from  high places, are all devices and sports for stimulating the sense of  motion. In most of these modes of motion the body is passive or  semipassive, save in such motions as skating and rotating on the feet. The  passiveness of the body precludes any important contribution of stimuli  from kinesthetic sources. The stimuli are probably furnished, as Dr. Hall  and others have suggested, by a redistribution of fluid pressure (due to  the unusual motions and positions of the body) to the inner walls of the  several vascular systems of the body.\"    [41] _Anatomy of Melancholy_, part iii., sect. ii, mem. ii, subs. iv.    [42] Sadger, \"Haut-, Schleimhaut-, und Muskel-erotik,\" _Jahrbuch fuer  psychoanalytische Forschungen_, Bd. iii, 1912, p. 556.    [43] Marro (_Puberta_, p. 367 et seq.) has some observations on this  point. It was an insight into this action of dancing which led the Spanish  clergy of the eighteenth century to encourage the national enthusiasm for  dancing (as Baretti informs us) in the interests of morality.    [44] It is scarcely necessary to remark that a primitive dance, even when  associated with courtship, is not necessarily a sexual pantomime; as  Wallaschek, in his comprehensive survey of primitive dances, observes, it  is more usually an animal pantomime, but nonetheless connected with the  sexual instinct, separation of the sexes, also, being no proof to the  contrary. (Wallaschek, _Primitive Music_, pp. 211-13.) Grosse (_Anfaenge  der Kunst_, English translation, p. 228) has pointed out that the best  dancer would be the best fighter and hunter, and that sexual selection and  natural selection would thus work in harmony.    [45] Fere, \"Le plaisir de la vue du Mouvement,\" _Comptes-rendus de la  Societe de Biologie_, November 2, 1901; also _Travail et Plaisir_, ch.  xxix.    [46] Groos repeatedly emphasizes the significance of this fact (_Spiele  der Menschen_, pp. 81-9, 460 et seq.); Grosse (_Anfaenge der Kunst_, p.  215) had previously made some remarks on this point.    [47] M. Kulischer, \"Die Geschlechtliche Zuchtwahl bei den Menschen in der  Urzeit,\" _Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1876, p. 140 _et seq._    [48] Sir W.R. Gowers, _Epilepsy_, 2d ed., 1901, pp. 61, 138.    [49] Guyon, _Lecons Cliniques sur les Maladies des Voies Urinaires_, 3d  ed., 1896, vol. ii, p. 397.    [50] See, e.g., Fere, _L'Instinct Sexuel_, pp. 222-23: Brantome was  probably the first writer in modern times who referred to this phenomenon.  MacGillicuddy (_Functional Disorders of the Nervous System in Women_, p.  110) refers to the case of a lady who always had sudden and uncontrollable  expulsion of urine whenever her husband even began to perform the marital  act, on which account he finally ceased intercourse with her. Kubary  states that in Ponape (Western Carolines) the men are accustomed to  titillate the vulva of their women with the tongue until the excitement is  so intense that involuntary emission of urine takes place; this is  regarded as the proper moment for intercourse.    [51] Thus Pitres and Regis (_Transactions of the International Medical  Congress, Moscow_, vol. iv, p. 19) record the case of a young girl whose  life was for some years tormented by a groundless fear of experiencing an  irresistible desire to urinate. This obsession arose from once seeing at a  theater a man whom she liked, and being overcome by sexual feeling  accompanied by so strong a desire to urinate that she had to leave the  theater. An exactly similar case in a young woman of erotic temperament,  but prudish, has been recorded by Freud (_Zur Neurosenlehre_, Bd. i, p.  54). Morbid obsessions of modesty involving the urinary sphere and  appearing at puberty are evidently based on transformed sexual emotion.  Such a case has been recorded by Marandon de Montyel (_Archives de  Neurologie_, vol. xii, 1901, p. 36); this lady, who was of somewhat  neuropathic temperament, from puberty onward, in order to be able to  urinate found it necessary not only to be absolutely alone, but to feel  assured that no one even knew what was taking place.

[57] It is a familiar fact that, in women, occasionally, a violent  explosion of laughter may be propagated to the bladder-center and produce  urination. \"She laughed till she nearly wetted the floor,\" I have heard a  young woman in the country say, evidently using without thought a familiar  locution. Professor Bechterew has recorded the case of a young married  lady who, from childhood, wherever she might be--in friends' houses, in  the street, in her own drawing-room--had always experienced an involuntary  and forcible emission of urine, which could not be stopped or controlled,  whenever she laughed; the bladder was quite sound and no muscular effort  produced the same result. (W. Bechterew, _Neurologisches Centralblatt_,  1899.) In women these relationships are most easily observed, partly  because in them the explosive centers are more easily discharged, and  partly, it is probable, so far as the bladder is concerned, because,  although after death the resistance to the emission of urine is notably  less in"]]]
