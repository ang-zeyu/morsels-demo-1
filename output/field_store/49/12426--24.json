Boil one pound of sweet potatos very tender, rub them while hot through  a colander; add six eggs well beaten, three quarters of a pound of  powdered sugar, three quarters of butter, and some grated nutmeg and  lemon peel, with a glass of brandy; put a paste in the dish, and when  the pudding is done, sprinkle the top with sugar, and cover it with bits  of citron. Irish potato pudding is made in the same manner, but is not  so good.           *       *       *       *       *    AN ARROW ROOT PUDDING.    Boil a quart of milk, and make it into a thick batter, with arrow root;  add six eggs, half a pound of butter, the same of pounded sugar, half a  nutmeg, and a little grated lemon peel; put a paste in the dish, and  bake it nicely; when done, sift sugar over it, and stick slips of citron  all over the top.           *       *       *       *       *    SAGO PUDDING.    Wash half a pound of sago in several waters; put it on to boil in a  quart of milk, with a stick of cinnamon; stir it very frequently, for it  is apt to burn: when it becomes quite thick, take out the cinnamon, stir  it in half a pound of butter, and an equal quantity of sugar, with a  gill of wine; when cold, add six eggs and four ounces of currants that  have been plumped in hot water--bake it in a paste.           *       *       *       *       *    PUFF PUDDING.    Beat six eggs, add six spoonsful of milk, and six of flour, butter some  cups, pour in the batter, and bake them quickly; turn them out, and eat  them with butter, sugar and nutmeg.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE PUDDING.    Boil half a pound of rice in milk, until it is quite tender; beat it  well with a wooden spoon to mash the grains; add three quarters of a  pound of sugar, and the same of melted butter; half a nutmeg, six eggs,  a gill of wine, and some grated lemon peel; put a paste in the dish, and  bake it. For change, it may be boiled, and eaten with butter, sugar, and  wine.           *       *       *       *       *    PLUM PUDDING.    Take a pound of the best flour, sift it, and make it up before sunrise,  with six eggs beaten light; a large spoonful of good yeast, and as much  milk as will make it the consistence of bread; let it rise well, knead  into it half a pound of butter, put in a grated nutmeg, with one and a  half pounds of raisins stoned and cut up; mix all well together, wet the  cloth, flour it, and tie it loosely, that the pudding may have room to  rise. Raisins for puddings or cakes, should be rubbed in a little flour,  to prevent their settling to the bottom--see that it does not stick to  them in lumps.           *       *       *       *       *    ALMOND PUDDING.    Put a pound of sweet almonds in hot water till the skin will slip off  them; pound them with a little orange flower or rose water, to keep them  from oiling; mix with them four crackers, finely pounded, or two gills  of rice flour; six eggs, a pint of cream, a pound of sugar, half a pound  of butter, and four table-spoonsful of wine; put a nice paste in the  bottom of your dish, garnish the edges, pour in the pudding bake it in a  moderate oven.           *       *       *       *       *    QUIRE OF PAPER PANCAKES.    Beat sixteen eggs, add to them a quart of milk, a nutmeg, half a pound  of flour, a pound of melted butter, a pound of sugar, and two gills of  wine; take care the flour be not in lumps; butter the pan for the first  pancake, run them as thin as possible, and when coloured, they are done;  do not turn them, but lay them carefully in the dish, sprinkling  powdered sugar between each layer--serve them up hot. This quantity will  make four dozen pancakes.           *       *       *       *       *    A CURD PUDDING.    Put two quarts of milk on the fire; when it boils, pour in half a pint  of white wine, strain the curd from the whey, and pound it in a mortar,  with six ounces of butter, half a pound of loaf sugar, and half a pint  of rice flour, or as much crackers beaten as fine as flour; six eggs  made light, and half a grated nutmeg--beat all well together, and bake  them in saucers in a moderate oven; turn them out carefully in your  dish, stick thin slices of citron in them, and pour on rich melted  butter, with sugar and wine.           *       *       *       *       *    LEMON PUDDING.    Grate the rind from six fresh lemons, squeeze the juice from three, and  strain it; beat the yelks of sixteen eggs very light, put to them  sixteen table-spoonsful of powdered loaf sugar, not heaped up--the same  of melted butter; add the grated rind, and the juice, four crackers  finely pounded, or an equal quantity of rice flour; or for change, six  ounces of corn meal which is excellent--beat it till light, put a puff  paste in your dish, pour the pudding in, and bake it in a moderate  oven--it must not be very brown.           *       *       *       *       *    BREAD PUDDING.    Grate the crumb of a stale loaf, and pour on it a pint of boiling  milk--let it stand an hour, then beat it to a pulp; add six eggs, well  beaten, half a pound of butter, the same of powdered sugar, half a  nutmeg, a glass of brandy, and some grated lemon peel--put a paste in  the dish, and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    THE HENRIETTA PUDDING.    Beat six eggs very light, sift into them a pound of loaf sugar powdered,  and a light pound of flour, with half a grated nutmeg, and a glass of  brandy; beat all together very well, add a pint of cream, pour it in a  deep dish, and bake it--when done, sift some powdered sugar over it.           *       *       *       *       *    TANSEY PUDDING.    Beat seven eggs very light, mix with them a pint of cream, and nearly as  much spinach juice, with a little juice of tansey; add a quarter of a  pound of powdered crackers or pounded rice made fine, a glass of wine,  some grated nutmeg and sugar; stir it over the fire to thicken, pour it  into a paste and bake it, or fry it like an omelette.           *       *       *       *       *    CHERRY PUDDING.    Beat six eggs very light, add half a pint of milk, six ounces flour,  eight ounces grated bread, twelve ounces suet, chopped fine, a little  salt; when it is beat well, mix in eighteen ounces preserved cherries or  damsins; bake or boil it. Make a sauce of melted butter, sugar and wine.           *       *       *       *       *    APPLE PIE.    Put a crust in the bottom of a dish, put on it a layer of ripe apples,  pared and sliced thin--then a layer of powdered sugar; do this  alternately till the dish is full; put in a few tea-spoonsful of rose  water and some cloves--put on a crust and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED APPLE PUDDING.    Take well flavoured apples, bake, but do not burn them, rub them through  a sieve, take one pound of the apples so prepared, mix with it, while  hot, half a pound of butter, and half a pound of powdered sugar; the  rinds of two lemons grated--and when cold, add six eggs well beaten; put  a paste in the bottom of a dish, and pour in the apples--half an hour  will bake it; sift a little sugar on the apples when baked.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE BOILED PUDDING.    Make up a pint of flour at sun rise, exactly as you do for bread; see  that it rises well--have a large pot of water boiling; and half an hour  before the puddings are to go to table, make the dough in balls, the  size of a goose egg; throw them in the water, and boil them quickly,  keeping the pot covered: they must be torn asunder, as cutting will make  them heavy; eat them with powdered sugar, butter, and grated nutmeg.           *       *       *       *       *    AN EXCELLENT AND CHEAP DESSERT DISH.    Wash a pint of small homony very clean, and boil it tender; add an equal  quantity of corn meal, make it into a batter with eggs, milk, and a  piece of butter; bake it like batter cakes on a griddle, and eat it with  butter and molasses.           *       *       *       *       *    SLICED APPLE PUDDING.    Beat six eggs very light, add a pint of rich milk, pare some apples or  peaches--slice them thin, make the eggs and milk into a tolerably thick  batter with flour, add a small cup of melted butter, put in the fruit,  and bake it in a deep dish--eat with sugar, butter, and nutmeg.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED INDIAN MEAL PUDDING.    Boil one quart of milk, mix in it two gills and a half of corn meal very  smoothly, seven eggs well beaten, a gill of molasses, and a good piece  of butter, bake it two hours.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED INDIAN MEAL PUDDING.    Mix one quart of corn meal, with three quarts of milk; take care it be  not lumpy--add three eggs and a gill of molasses; it must be put on at  sun rise, to eat at three o'clock; the great art in this pudding is  tying the bag properly, as the meal swells very much.           *       *       *       *       *    PUMPKIN PUDDING.    Stew a fine sweet pumpkin till soft and dry; rub it through a sieve, mix  with the pulp six eggs quite light, a quarter of a pound of butter, half  a pint of new milk, some pounded ginger and nutmeg, a wine glass of  brandy, and sugar to your taste. Should it be too liquid, stew it a  little drier, put a paste round the edges, and in the bottom of a  shallow dish or plate--pour in the mixture, cut some thin bits of paste,  twist them, and lay them across the top, and bake it nicely.           *       *       *       *       *    FAYETTE PUDDING.    Slice a loaf of bread tolerably thick--lay the slices in the bottom of a  dish, cutting them so as to cover"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#19)"],[1,"exist, which are  concealed thro' the want of the arts of civilized life. The Mandingoes  speak of these countries with a great air of mystery, and are extremely  jealous, lest Europeans should obtain  any information relative to them: as  they carry on almost exclusively, this branch of commerce.    When I was in the Bashia branch of the Rio Pongo, a meteor of an  extraordinary kind appeared for two successive nights, directing its course  from NE. to SW. which put the natives in a most dreadful state of  consternation; the women fell into loud lamentations, the men beat their  drums, and sent forth the most horrid yells; imagining, that this barbarous  uproar would drive away the object of their fears. In eclipses of the sun  and moon, they repeat their prayers and sacrifices, with the same clamour,  under the notion that it will frighten away the monster which they suppose  to obscure these planets from their view. These superstitious notions have  the most powerful influence over the Negro's mind, and it is impossible to  dissuade or reason him out of them.    From all I have stated, the great importance of these countries, to open an  intercourse with the interior of Africa, must appear. On the borders of the  Rio Pongo, and other rivers, excellent lands, forming hill, and dale, are  every where to be found, and well adapted to agricultural experiments. With  the _consent of the chiefs_, these might be obtained at a small expense,  and many of them with whom I have communicated, would gladly embrace a wise  interference; but they all complain, \"white man not know their fashion,\"  intimating in very forcible language, that every caution should be used, at  innovation upon their laws, customs, and manners. Let example first excite  their admiration, and their barbarism will bow before the arts of  civilization, and slavery be gradually abolished.    Before I conclude this chapter, I shall make some observations upon the  temperature of the western countries of Africa, situated between Cape Verde  and Cape Palmas, mention the principal diseases, and those which Europeans  are most exposed to on their first arrival in these countries, and give  general precautions against the dangers of the climate, &c.    The inexhaustible fecundity of Africa holds out to Europeans strong  excitements to enterprise and research; but in the pursuit, the diseases  which prevail in this country should be well understood; and it would be  highly expedient, in any plans of colonization, to attach a medical staff,  as the natives have no idea of the art of surgery, except what arises from  the knowledge they have of the properties of herbs, and the superstitions  attached to their fetishism. In annexing this extraordinary country to the  civilized world, and exploring its stores of wealth, a burning climate, and  the diseases peculiar thereto, unite with the barbarism of its inhabitants  in opposition to the European; but by a strict observance of necessary  rules, and avoiding all kinds of excess, the formidable influence of the  sun may be resisted, and the pernicious effects of exhalations, which arise  from a humid, marshy, and woody country, may in a great degree be obviated;  and I am sorry to say, that for want of proper precaution and through  ignorance, fatal consequences more frequently occur, than from the  unhealthiness of the climate.    The temperature from Cape Verde to Cape Palmas is extremely various from  the vertical rays of the sun, the nature of the soil, and the face of the  country.    In the months from November to March, by Fahrenheit's thermometer, it has  been from 70 deg. in the morning, to 90 deg. at noon, in the shade; and nearly the  same variation has been observed at the river of Sierra Leone; and in some  places in the Foolah country it has been from 50 deg. to 90 deg.    From July to October, the mean temperature in the river Gambia, by  Fahrenheit, has been from 90 deg. in the morning to 100 deg. at noon in the shade,  and during the same months at Sierra Leone from about 92 deg. to 106 deg.; but a  variety of local circumstances may give a greater or less degree of heat:  this however may serve to give a general idea of the temperature of these  countries. The island of Goree, for example, the island of Bance, and the  bay of Sierra Leone, are more healthy, enjoying the cooling sea breezes,  more than situations in the rivers more interior. The banks of all the  rivers in Africa, which I have visited, are enclosed by impenetrable  forests, marshes, and the closely combined mangrove tree, and it is but  seldom that the land forms an uneven dry surface on their borders.  Instances however in the Sierra Leone, Rio Pongo, &c. occasionally occur,  when the most picturesque scenery adorns the river.    From May to August, hurricanes or _tornados_, before described, prevail  upon the Windward Coast, and this phenomenon is to be met with from Cape  Verde to Cape Palmas. The months from November to March are remarkable for  the prevalence of east and north-east winds. When these winds, which are  called _harmatans_, set in, they are accompanied with a heavy atmosphere,  and are of a dry and destructive nature. Every description of vegetation is  blasted by their influence, and every object, animate and inanimate, feels  their powerful effects; the skin is parched and dried, and every feature is  shriveled and contracted. The most compact cabinet work will give way, the  seams of flooring open, and the planks even bend. Furniture of every sort  is distorted; in short, nothing escapes their dreadful power. The nights at  this period are cool and refreshing.    The months of July, August, September, and October are rainy, from the  equator to about the 20th degree of north latitude. Towards the equinoxial  they begin earlier, and make their progress to windward, but the difference  throughout the whole of the north tropic fluctuates little more or less  than 15 or 20 days. When the rains commence, the earth, before parched up  and consolidated into an impenetrable crust, by the powerful influence of  the sun and a long period of drought, is immediately  covered with vermin  and reptiles of all sorts, creating a moving map of putrefaction. The  natives ascribe to these many of their diseases; but a further cause may be  added, namely, the great change from heat to cold, and the variations at  this season.    The powerful influence of the sun, which at this period is almost vertical,  quickly dissipates the clouds which obscure the sky, and produces an almost  insupportable effect; but new clouds soon condense, and intercept the solar  rays; a mitigating heat follows; the pores are compressed, and prespiration  ceases. Variations succeeding so rapidly, are attended with the most  serious effects, and the most fatal consequences. And, lastly, the noxious  exhalations arising from the inaccessible forests and marshy swamps which  abound in Africa, and from numerous animal and vegetable remains of the dry  season, which cover the soil every where, are productive of putrid  effluvia. These rains, or rather periodical torrents of water, which  annually  visit the tropics, invariably continue for about four months of  the year, and during the other eight it rarely happens that one single drop  falls; in some instances, however, periodical showers have happened in the  dry season, but the effects of these are scarcely perceptible on  vegetation; the consequence is, that the surface of the earth forms an  impervious stratum or crust, which shuts up all exhalation.    When the rains cease, and the heat of the sun absorbs the evaporations from  the earth, which have been so long concealed during the dry season, a most  offensive and disgusting effluvia is produced, which then fastens upon the  human system, and begets diseases that in a short time shew their effects  with dreadful violence; and no period is more to be guarded against than  when the rains cease, for the intense heat completely impregnates the  atmosphere with animalculae and corrupted matter.    The principal complaints which attack Europeans are, malignant nervous  fevers, which prevail throughout the rainy season, but they are expelled by  the winds which blow in the month of December; from hence these _harmatans_  are considered healthy, but I have heard various opinions among medical men  on this subject. Dr. Ballard (now no more), whose long residence at Bance  Island, and in Africa, and whose intimate acquaintance with the diseases of  these climates, peculiarly qualified him to decide upon the fact, was of  opinion, most decidedly, that the _harmatan_ season was not the most  healthy.    When this malignant fever takes place in all its virulence, its  consequences are the most disastrous; the symptoms are violent and without  gradation, and the blood is heated to an increased degree beyond what is  experienced in Europe; the ninth day is generally decisive, and this is a  crisis that requires the most vigilant attention and care over the patient.  I speak this from personal experience. In consequence of the fatigues I  underwent in the Rio Pongo, and other rivers, and having been for several  days and nights exposed to an open sea, and to torrents of rain upon land,  I was seized with this dreadful disorder, although I had enjoyed an  uninterrupted state of good health before, and on my arrival at the colony  of Sierra Leone was unable to support myself on shore; and had it not been  for the kind attention and skilful prescriptions of Dr. Robson of that  colony, with the friendly offices of Captain Brown, I should, in all  probability, at this stage have finished my travels and existence together.  Dysenteries frequently follow this fever, which are of a very fatal  tendency, and sometimes the flux is unattended by fever. This disease is  not uncommon in persons otherwise healthy, but it is productive of great  debility, which requires a"]]]
