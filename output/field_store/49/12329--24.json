From it he derived strength to endure the torture, and to bear  his sentence without flinching. I found it in this cell, after the death  of the martyr, and have preserved it as a relic. To-day I brought it to  you, for it seemed to me that this book must possess in itself a divine  power. Write in it what you have to write, Mynheer Cornelius; and  though, unfortunately, I am not able to read, I will take care that what  you write shall be accomplished.\"    Cornelius took the Bible, and kissed it reverently.    \"With what shall I write?\" asked Cornelius.    \"There is a pencil in the Bible,\" said Rosa.    This was the pencil which John de Witt had lent to his brother, and  which he had forgotten to take away with him.    Cornelius took it, and on the second fly leaf (for it will be remembered  that the first was torn out), drawing near his end like his godfather,  he wrote with a no less firm hand:--    \"On this day, the 23d of August, 1672, being on the point of rendering,  although innocent, my soul to God on the scaffold, I bequeath to Rosa  Gryphus the only worldly goods which remain to me of all that I have  possessed in this world, the rest having been confiscated; I bequeath, I  say, to Rosa Gryphus three bulbs, which I am convinced must produce,  in the next May, the Grand Black Tulip for which a prize of a hundred  thousand guilders has been offered by the Haarlem Society, requesting  that she may be paid the same sum in my stead, as my sole heiress, under  the only condition of her marrying a respectable young man of about  my age, who loves her, and whom she loves, and of her giving the black  tulip, which will constitute a new species, the name of Rosa Barlaensis,  that is to say, hers and mine combined.    \"So may God grant me mercy, and to her health and long life!    \"Cornelius van Baerle.\"    The prisoner then, giving the Bible to Rosa, said,--    \"Read.\"    \"Alas!\" she answered, \"I have already told you I cannot read.\"    Cornelius then read to Rosa the testament that he had just made.    The agony of the poor girl almost overpowered her.    \"Do you accept my conditions?\" asked the prisoner, with a melancholy  smile, kissing the trembling hands of the afflicted girl.    \"Oh, I don't know, sir,\" she stammered.    \"You don't know, child, and why not?\"    \"Because there is one condition which I am afraid I cannot keep.\"    \"Which? I should have thought that all was settled between us.\"    \"You give me the hundred thousand guilders as a marriage portion, don't  you?    \"And under the condition of my marrying a man whom I love?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Well, then, sir, this money cannot belong to me. I shall never love any  one; neither shall I marry.\"    And, after having with difficulty uttered these words, Rosa almost  swooned away in the violence of her grief.    Cornelius, frightened at seeing her so pale and sinking, was going  to take her in his arms, when a heavy step, followed by other dismal  sounds, was heard on the staircase, amidst the continued barking of the  dog.    \"They are coming to fetch you. Oh God! Oh God!\" cried Rosa, wringing her  hands. \"And have you nothing more to tell me?\"    She fell on her knees with her face buried in her hands and became  almost senseless.    \"I have only to say, that I wish you to preserve these bulbs as a  most precious treasure, and carefully to treat them according to the  directions I have given you. Do it for my sake, and now farewell, Rosa.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" she said, without raising her head, \"I will do anything you  bid me, except marrying,\" she added, in a low voice, \"for that, oh! that  is impossible for me.\"    She then put the cherished treasure next her beating heart.    The noise on the staircase which Cornelius and Rosa had heard was caused  by the Recorder, who was coming for the prisoner. He was followed by  the executioner, by the soldiers who were to form the guard round the  scaffold, and by some curious hangers-on of the prison.    Cornelius, without showing any weakness, but likewise without any  bravado, received them rather as friends than as persecutors, and  quietly submitted to all those preparations which these men were obliged  to make in performance of their duty.    Then, casting a glance into the yard through the narrow iron-barred  window of his cell, he perceived the scaffold, and, at twenty paces  distant from it, the gibbet, from which, by order of the Stadtholder,  the outraged remains of the two brothers De Witt had been taken down.    When the moment came to descend in order to follow the guards, Cornelius  sought with his eyes the angelic look of Rosa, but he saw, behind the  swords and halberds, only a form lying outstretched near a wooden bench,  and a deathlike face half covered with long golden locks.    But Rosa, whilst falling down senseless, still obeying her friend, had  pressed her hand on her velvet bodice and, forgetting everything in  the world besides, instinctively grasped the precious deposit which  Cornelius had intrusted to her care.    Leaving the cell, the young man could still see in the convulsively  clinched fingers of Rosa the yellowish leaf from that Bible on which  Cornelius de Witt had with such difficulty and pain written these few  lines, which, if Van Baerle had read them, would undoubtedly have been  the saving of a man and a tulip.          Chapter 12. The Execution      Cornelius had not three hundred paces to walk outside the prison to  reach the foot of the scaffold. At the bottom of the staircase, the dog  quietly looked at him whilst he was passing; Cornelius even fancied  he saw in the eyes of the monster a certain expression as it were of  compassion.    The dog perhaps knew the condemned prisoners, and only bit those who  left as free men.    The shorter the way from the door of the prison to the foot of the  scaffold, the more fully, of course, it was crowded with curious people.    These were the same who, not satisfied with the blood which they had  shed three days before, were now craving for a new victim.    And scarcely had Cornelius made his appearance than a fierce groan ran  through the whole street, spreading all over the yard, and re-echoing  from the streets which led to the scaffold, and which were likewise  crowded with spectators.    The scaffold indeed looked like an islet at the confluence of several  rivers.    In the midst of these threats, groans, and yells, Cornelius, very likely  in order not to hear them, had buried himself in his own thoughts.    And what did he think of in his last melancholy journey?    Neither of his enemies, nor of his judges, nor of his executioners.    He thought of the beautiful tulips which he would see from heaven above,  at Ceylon, or Bengal, or elsewhere, when he would be able to look with  pity on this earth, where John and Cornelius de Witt had been murdered  for having thought too much of politics, and where Cornelius van Baerle  was about to be murdered for having thought too much of tulips.    \"It is only one stroke of the axe,\" said the philosopher to himself,  \"and my beautiful dream will begin to be realised.\"    Only there was still a chance, just as it had happened before to M. de  Chalais, to M. de Thou, and other slovenly executed people, that the  headsman might inflict more than one stroke, that is to say, more than  one martyrdom, on the poor tulip-fancier.    Yet, notwithstanding all this, Van Baerle mounted the scaffold not the  less resolutely, proud of having been the friend of that illustrious  John, and godson of that noble Cornelius de Witt, whom the ruffians, who  were now crowding to witness his own doom, had torn to pieces and burnt  three days before.    He knelt down, said his prayers, and observed, not without a feeling of  sincere joy, that, laying his head on the block, and keeping his eyes  open, he would be able to his last moment to see the grated window of  the Buytenhof.    At length the fatal moment arrived, and Cornelius placed his chin on the  cold damp block. But at this moment his eyes closed involuntarily, to  receive more resolutely the terrible avalanche which was about to fall  on his head, and to engulf his life.    A gleam like that of lightning passed across the scaffold: it was the  executioner raising his sword.    Van Baerle bade farewell to the great black tulip, certain of awaking in  another world full of light and glorious tints.    Three times he felt, with a shudder, the cold current of air from the  knife near his neck, but what a surprise! he felt neither pain nor  shock.    He saw no change in the colour of the sky, or of the world around him.    Then suddenly Van Baerle felt gentle hands raising him, and soon stood  on his feet again, although trembling a little.    He looked around him. There was some one by his side, reading a large  parchment, sealed with a huge seal of red wax.    And the same sun, yellow and pale, as it behooves a Dutch sun to be, was  shining in the skies; and the same grated window looked down upon  him from the Buytenhof; and the same rabble, no longer yelling, but  completely thunderstruck, were staring at him from the streets below.    Van Baerle began to be sensible to what was going on around him.    His Highness, William, Prince of Orange, very likely afraid that  Van Baerle's blood would turn the scale of judgment against him, had  compassionately taken into consideration his good character, and the  apparent proofs of his innocence.    His Highness, accordingly, had granted him his life.    Cornelius at first hoped that the pardon would be complete, and that he  would be restored to his full liberty and to his flower borders at Dort.    But Cornelius was mistaken. To use an expression of Madame de Sevigne,  who wrote about the same time, \"there was a postscript to the letter;\"  and the most important part of the letter was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#18)"],[1," victories gained by the Czecho-Slovaks over the Bolsheviks were  at Penza and Samara. Penza was captured by them after three days' fighting  at the end of May. Later the Czecho-Slovaks also took Sysran on the Volga,  Kazan with its large arsenal, Simbirsk and Yekaterinburg, connecting  Tcheliabinsk with Petrograd, and occupied practically the whole  Volga region.    In Siberia they defeated a considerable force of German-Magyar ex-prisoners  in Krasnoyarsk and Omsk and established themselves firmly in Udinsk. On  June 29, 15,000 Czecho-Slovaks under General Diderichs, after handing an  ultimatum to the Bolsheviks at Vladivostok, occupied the city without much  resistance. Only at one spot fighting took place and some 160 Bolsheviks  were killed. The Czecho-Slovaks, assisted by Japanese and Allied troops,  then proceeded to the north and north-west, while the Bolsheviks and German  prisoners retreated to Chabarovsk. In September the Czech and Allied troops  from Vladivostok joined hands with the Czecho-Slovaks from Irkutsk and  Western Siberia, and thus gained control over practically the whole  trans-Siberian railway. By this means they have done great service to the  Allies, especially to Great Britain, by defending the East against the  German invaders. Furthermore, it was the Czecho-Slovaks' bold action which  induced Japan and America at last to intervene in Russia and for the sake  of Russia, and it was their control of the Siberian railway which made such  intervention possible. Let us hope that their action will lead to the  regeneration and salvation of the Russian nation.    The service rendered by Czecho-Slovak troops to the Allied cause was, of  course, justly appreciated by the Allies. Mr. Lloyd George sent the  following telegram to Professor Masaryk on September 9:        \"On behalf of the British War Cabinet I send you our heartiest      congratulations on the striking successes won by the Czecho-Slovak      forces against the armies of German and Austrian troops in Siberia. The      story of the adventures and triumphs of this small army is, indeed, one      of the greatest epics of history. It has filled us all with admiration      for the courage, persistence and self-control of your countrymen, and      shows what can be done to triumph over time, distance and lack of      material resources by those holding the spirit of freedom in their      hearts. Your nation has rendered inestimable service to Russia and to      the Allies in their struggle to free the world from despotism. We shall      never forget it.\"    The deeds of our army met with equal admiration and gratitude also in  Bohemia. This is clearly shown by the speech of the Czech deputy Stribrny,  delivered in the Austrian Reichsrat on July 17, and entirely suppressed in  the Austrian and German press. Despite the vigilance on the part of the  Austrian authorities, however, we have been able to secure the full text of  this remarkable speech which reads as follows:        \"GENTLEMEN,--Let me first of all emphasise that my speech is not a      defence of the Czech nation and of the Czech soldiers. There are no      judges in this parliament competent to judge us.        \"You call us traitors. We accept your declaration as the view of our      enemy. Nothing more--nothing less.        \"You gentlemen on the German benches, you dared, however, to touch the      honour of our soldiers--you called them cowards. And in this respect we      are not going to keep silent. We shall always protest against such      injustice! We shall never permit these heroes to be abused by being      called 'cowards.' If there is a single gentleman among you he ought for      a moment to reflect on the soul of a Czech soldier--a soldier who has      been compelled by force to fight in a war which the German Imperial      Chancellor has openly called 'a war of Germans against the Slavs'; a      soldier who was compelled under the threat of immediate execution to      take up arms against the interests of the Slavs, against the interests      of his brothers, against the interests of his own country--Bohemia.      Well then, was it cowardice on the part of this soldier when he,      exposed to the fire of Austrian and German guns and machine guns from      behind, went over to the other side? Was he a coward when, while free      to remain in his captivity as a prisoner of war safely waiting until      the end of the war, he volunteered to fight again and was ready to risk      his life and health once more? Is that Czech soldier a coward who went      once more into the trenches, although aware that if he were captured he      would not be treated as an ordinary prisoner of war but as a deserter,      and hanged accordingly? Is that man a coward who sacrifices his family      which he has left behind and his soil and property inherited from his      ancestors? Is that man a coward who sacrifices himself, his father and      mother, his wife and children for the sake of his nation and country?        \"Is that Czech soldier not a hero who to-day is voluntarily fighting      from the Ural Mountains to Vladivostok, on the Piave and in France?        \"If there is a single gentleman, a real gentleman among you, let him      stand up and answer these questions.        \"And if there is not such a gentleman among you, remember the words of      our bitter enemy the late Minister for Home Defence, Baron Georgi, who      related to this House in a secret sitting all that our regiments have      accomplished. He could not as a soldier suppress a sigh and say, 'We      regret all those treacheries of Czech soldiers, still more because from      their deeds committed on the side of our enemy we can realise what a      splendid military material we have lost.' And if this is not      sufficient, I will remind you of the opinion of those who are in your      eyes the best judges--the Prussian officers. In an Austrian officers'      canteen where Czech soldiers had been abused the whole evening by being      called cowards, the Prussian officers present were asked to give their      opinion on this point. They answered, 'We shall only be able to judge      as to whether the Czechs are cowards or not when they begin to fight      against us.'        \"You should at least be gentlemanly enough not to slander your enemies      who have proved themselves to be greater heroes than any other      soldiers, because they are voluntary heroes, whereas the others are      heroes under compulsion!        \"This question of cowardice is therefore, I hope, settled forever.        \"And now with regard to the title of 'traitors.' _We are traitors to      Austria--every one of us admits it honestly_. Not one of you, however,      has the right to reproach us for this. All of you are patriots by      order, and it cannot be otherwise in a dynastic state like Austria.        \"With regard to the patriotism of the Magyars, we have proofs of this      dating from 1866. They have done the same as we are doing to-day. They      surrendered and organised Klapka's legions against Austria. The fact      that they were punished for their treachery by being given their own      independence does not speak against us.        \"Yes, gentlemen, we are traitors as much as you Magyars, or as you      Germans were, or would be under similar circumstances. And _we want the      same as you want_, i.e. _to be free citizens of our own state_. Our own      state--that does not mean to have a few officials or one more      university. To have a state of our own--that means to be able to decide      freely if our soldiers shall go to war again, and if they do, to see      that they go only for the interests of their own nation, and not for      the interests of their enemies. An independent state--that means for us      no longer to die by order of foreigners, and no longer to live under      foreign domination.        \"Let me remind the gentlemen on the German benches of a lesson in      history. Up till 1866 Germany was nominally under the sceptre of the      Habsburg dynasty--a German dynasty, mind you. Prussia and Northern      Germany felt the indignity of the 'foreign' rule of the Habsburgs--and      they started the fratricidal war in 1866 in order to get rid of this      rule....        \"It is for you gentlemen on the German benches to speak! Let him who      regrets the blood then spilt stand up and speak. Let him stand up and      condemn Bismarck and William I. who started the war in order to deliver      Germany from the same yoke from which we are trying to free ourselves      to-day. If there is a single man among the Germans who would be      prepared to say that the war against Austria should never have      happened, let him stand up. That war was carried on to free Germany      from the incapable rule of Vienna and it had the same aim in view which      you reproach us with to-day and call high treason!        \"You are silent, gentlemen! We are satisfied with your silence. And now      go and continue to stone and abuse us.\"    5. In the meantime, Professor Masaryk arrived in the United States _via_  Japan in May, 1918. He was accorded a splendid reception at Chicago where  some 200,000 Czecho-Slovaks, as well as various Allied representatives,  greeted him. His presence in the United States not only stimulated  recruiting among Czecho-Slovaks there, but had also political results,  especially when the Central Powers launched their peace offensive.    At the end of May, Mr. Lansing issued the following statement:        \"The Secretary of State desires to announce that the proceedings of the      Congress of Oppressed Nationalities of Austria-Hungary which was held      in Rome in April have been followed with great interest by the      Government of the United States, and that the nationalist aspirations      of the Czecho-Slovaks and Jugoslavs have the earnest sympathy of this      government.\"  "]]]
