[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#19)"],[1,"e--the little  Napoleon Charles died in the year 1807, of the measles.    This was a terrific blow that struck the parents, and the imperial pair  of France with equal force. Napoleon's eyes filled with tears when this  intelligence was brought him, and a cry of horror escaped  Josephine's lips.    \"Now I am lost!\" she murmured in a low voice; \"now my fate is decided.  He will put me away.\"    But after this first egotistical outburst of her own pain, she hastened  to the Hague to weep with her daughter, and bring her away from the  place associated with her loss and her anguish. Hortense returned with  the empress to St. Cloud; while her husband, who had almost succumbed to  his grief, was compelled to seek renewed health in the baths of the  Pyrenees. The royal palace at the Hague now stood desolate again; death  had banished life and joy from its halls; and, though the royal pair  were subsequently compelled to return to it, joy and happiness came back  with them no more.    King Louis had returned from the Pyrenees in a more gloomy and  ill-natured frame of mind than ever; a sickly distrust, a repulsive  irritability, had taken possession of his whole being, and his young  wife no longer had the good-will to bear with his caprices, and excuse  his irritable disposition. They were totally different in their views,  desires, inclinations, and aspirations; and their children, instead of  being a means of reuniting, seemed to estrange them the more, for each  insisted on considering them his or her exclusive property, and in  having them educated according to his or her views and wishes.    But Hortense was soon to forget her own household troubles and cares, in  the greater misery of her mother. A letter from Josephine, an agonized  appeal to her daughter for consolation, recalled Hortense to her  mother's side, and she left the Hague and hastened to Paris.        CHAPTER VII.    PREMONITIONS.    Josephine's fears, and the prophecies of the French clairvoyante, were  now about to be fulfilled. The crown which Josephine had reluctantly and  sorrowfully accepted, and which she had afterward worn with so much  grace and amiability, with such natural majesty and dignity, was about  to fall from her head. Napoleon had the cruel courage, now that the  dreamed-of future had been realized, to put away from him the woman who  had loved him and chosen him when he had nothing to offer her but his  hopes for the future. Josephine, who, with smiling courage and brave  fidelity, had stood at his side in the times of want and humiliation,  was now to be banished from his side into the isolation of a glittering  widowhood. Napoleon had the courage to determine that this should be  done, but he lacked the courage to break it to Josephine, and to  pronounce the word of separation himself. He was determined to sacrifice  to his ambition the woman he had so long called his \"good angel;\" and  he, who had never trembled in battle, trembled at the thought of her  tears, and avoided meeting her sad, entreating gaze.    But Josephine divined the whole terrible misfortune that hung  threateningly over her head. She read it in the gloomy, averted  countenance of the emperor, who, since his recent return from Vienna,  had caused the door that connected his room with that of his wife to be  locked; she read it in the faces of the courtiers, who dared to address  her with less reverence, but with a touch of compassionate sympathy; she  heard it in the low whispering that ceased when she approached a group  of persons in her parlors; it was betrayed to her in the covert,  mysterious insinuations of the public press, which attached a deep and  comprehensive significance to the emperor's journey to Vienna.    She knew that her destiny must now be fulfilled, and that she was too  weak to offer any resistance. But she was determined to act her part as  wife and empress worthily to the end. Her tears should not flow  outwardly, but inwardly to her grief-stricken heart; she suppressed her  sighs with a smile, and concealed the pallor of her cheeks with rouge.  But she longed for a heart to whom she could confide her anguish, and  show her tears, and therefore called her daughter to her side.    How painful was this reunion of mother and daughter, how many tears were  shed, how bitter were the lamentations Josephine whispered in her  daughter's ear!    \"If you knew,\" said she, \"in what torments I have passed the last few  weeks, in which I was no longer his wife, although compelled to appear  before the world as such! What glances, Hortense, what glances courtiers  fasten upon a discarded woman! In what uncertainty, what expectancy more  cruel than death, have I lived and am I still living, awaiting the  lightning stroke that has long glowed in Napoleon's eyes[15]!\"    [Footnote 15: Josephine's own words.--Bourrienne, vol. viii., p. 243.]    Hortense listened to her mother's lamentations with a heart full of  bitterness. She thought of how she had been compelled to sacrifice her  own happiness to that of her mother, of how she had been condemned to a  union without love, in order that the happiness of her mother's union  might be established on a firm basis. And now all had been in vain; the  sacrifice had not sufficed to arrest the tide of misfortune now about to  bear down her unhappy mother. Hortense could do nothing to avert it. She  was a queen, and yet only a weak, pitiable woman, who envied the beggar  on the street her freedom and her humble lot. Both mother and daughter  stood on the summit of earthly magnificence, and yet this empress and  this queen felt themselves so poor and miserable, that they looked back  with envy at the days of the revolution--the days in which they had led  in retirement a life of poverty and want. Then, though struggling with  want and care, they had been rich in hopes, in wishes, in illusions;  now, they possessed all that could adorn life; now millions of men bowed  down to them, and saluted them with the proud word \"majesty,\" and yet  empress and queen were now poor in hopes and wishes, poor in the  illusions that lay shattered at their feet, and rejoicing only in the  one happiness, that of being able to confide their misery to each other.    A few days after her arrival, the emperor caused Hortense to be called  to his cabinet. He advanced toward her with vivacity, but before the  gaze of her large eyes the glance of the man before whom the whole world  now bowed, almost quailed.    \"Hortense,\" said he, \"we are now called on to decide an important  matter, and it is our duty not to recoil. The nation has done so much  for me and my family, that I owe them the sacrifice which they demand of  me. The tranquillity and welfare of France require that I shall choose a  wife who can give the country an heir to the throne. Josephine has been  living in suspense and anguish for six months, and this must end. You,  Hortense, are her dearest friend and her confidante; she loves you more  than all else in the world. Will you undertake to prepare your mother  for this step? You would thereby relieve my heart of a heavy burden.\"    Hortense had the strength to suppress her tears, and fasten her eyes on  the emperor's countenance in a firm, determined gaze. His glance again  quailed, as the lion recoils from the angry glance of a pure, innocent  woman. Hortense had the courage to positively refuse the  emperors request.    \"How, Hortense!\" exclaimed Napoleon with emotion. \"You then refuse my  request?\"    \"Sire,\" said she, hardly able longer to restrain her tears, \"sire, I  have not the strength to stab my mother to the heart[16].\"    [Footnote 16: Schelten, vol. ii., p. 45.]    And regardless of etiquette, Hortense turned away and left the emperor's  cabinet, the tears pouring in streams from her eyes.        CHAPTER VIII.    THE DIVORCE.    Napoleon made one other attempt to impart to Josephine, through a third  person, the distressing tidings of his determination with regard to  herself. He begged Eugene, the Viceroy of Italy, to come to Paris, and  on his arrival informed him of his intentions and of his wish. Eugene,  like his sister, received this intelligence in silent submissiveness,  but like his sister, he refused to impart to his mother, tidings that  must destroy her happiness forever.    The emperor had finally to make up his mind to impart the distressing  tidings in person.    It was on the 30th of November, 1809. The emperor and empress dined, as  usual, at the same table. His gloomy aspect on entering the room made  Josephine's heart quake; she read in his countenance that the fatal hour  had come. But she repressed the tears which were rushing to her eyes,  and looked entreatingly at her daughter, who sat on the opposite side of  the table, a deathly pallor on her countenance.    Not a word was spoken during this gloomy, ominous dinner. The sighs and  half-suppressed moaning that escaped Josephine's heaving breast were  quite audible. Without, the wind shrieked and howled dismally, and drove  the rain violently against the window-panes; within, an ominous,  oppressive silence prevailed. The commotion of Nature contrasted, and  yet, at the same time, harmonized strangely with this human silence.  Napoleon broke this silence but once, and that was when, in a harsh  voice, he asked the lackey, who stood behind him, what time it was. Then  all was still as before.    At last Napoleon gave the signal to rise from the table, and coffee was  then taken standing. Napoleon drank hastily, and then set the cup down  with a trembling hand, making it ring out as it touched the table. With  an angry gesture he dismissed the attendants.    \"Sire, may Hortense remain?\" asked Josephine, almost inaudibly.    \"No!\" exclaimed the emperor, vehemently. Hortense made a profound  obeisance, and, taking leave of her mother with a look of tender  compassion, left the room, followed by the rest.    The imperial pair were now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12027"],[0,"Crime: Its Cause and Treatment (#19)"],[1,"to say on the subject?    We should always bear in mind that crime can never mean anything except  the violation of law, when the violator is convicted; that it has no  necessary reference to the general moral condition of man. Is the number  of criminal convictions growing, and if so why? In the first place, the  criminal code is lengthening every year. When civilized man began making  criminal codes, there were comparatively few things forbidden. The codes  were largely made up of those acts which, in some form, have for ages  been generally thought to be criminal. Religious beliefs, customs and  habits were included in the penal statutes. So were such things as  sorcery and witchcraft. Property was then not an important subject in  man's activities. When the instinct to create and accumulate property  began to rule life, the criminal code grew very rapidly. Complex  business interests, combined with the constantly increasing value placed  on property, were always calling for new statutes.    The same tendency, indirectly, demanded still other statutes until at  the present time this class of crimes makes up a large part of the  criminal code and is growing steadily each year. Then too, the necessity  of property has called for the violation of this part of the criminal  code more than any other, and it has naturally caused a considerable  increase of crime. Man in his social and political activities is ever  weaving and bending and twisting back and forth. For a number of years  the universal tendency, especially in America, has been toward what is  called \"Social Control\", the idea being that more and more people should  be controlled in an increasing number of ways. Of course, if people are  to be controlled they must be controlled by other people. This policy  has been extended until we are ever pushing further into the regulation  of the habits, customs and lives of all the individual members of the  community. The majority, when it has the power, has never hesitated to  force its ways of living, its ideas, customs and habits on the minority.  The majority, when strong enough, has always assumed that it was right,  and provided that others must live its way or not at all. The pendulum  is now swinging far this way as is evidenced by prohibition, the  persistent campaign for Sunday laws, and the growing belief in social  control as a means of changing and directing humanity.    This has added to the criminal code and has increased the number of men  in prisons. Two statutes of recent date in most of the states are  responsible for a very large increase in the number of convicts. The  conspiracy statute which is used today is a deliberate scheme on the  part of prosecutors to get men into the penitentiary by charging an  agreement or confederation of two or more persons to do something,  which, if really committed, would be a misdemeanor, or no crime  whatever. Under this charge, whether made specifically or in connection  with another crime, the rules of evidence have been opened and relaxed  until the wildest and most remote hearsay is freely admitted for the  plain purpose of convicting men who have really been guilty of no  specific act. It is in effect punishing one for his thoughts; the  business of the court or jury being to find out whether in some  particular he has an evil mind.    The statute forbidding the use of the \"confidence game\" in obtaining  property sends to prison a constant stream of persons who, until a few  years ago, would have been guilty of no crime. This law, as interpreted  by the courts, really means the procuring of money by dishonest means.  Under this statute the court and jury hear the evidence and say whether  the means charged are dishonest or not. This, of course, leaves the law  so that the temporarily prevailing power, perhaps only the prosecuting  attorney, may send men to prison who take means of getting money that  are not practiced or at least advocated by the ones who procure the  passage and enforcement of the law.    Numberless ways used by the strong to get money are considered dishonest  by a large class of men and women: exaggerated and lying advertisements,  forestalling the markets, the acts and wiles of the professional  salesman, misrepresenting goods and other methods that could never be  catalogued because new ways are constantly coming to light. The logical  end of all these indefinite and uncertain laws is to pass one statute  providing that whoever does wrong shall be imprisoned, _et cetera, et  cetera_. The law never can specify all the ways of doing wrong and many  of the meanest and most annoying things have never been, and from the  nature of things never can be, prohibited by the statutes. No man is a  good citizen, a good neighbor, a good friend, or a good man just because  he obeys the law. The intrinsic worth is determined mainly by the  intrinsic make-up.    Civilization is all the while making it harder for men to keep out of  prison. Especially do the weak and ignorant and poor find that  environment is constantly creating more inhibitions as time goes on.  While rules and customs are prohibiting more and more ways of getting  property, the needs growing out of civilization are always increasing.  The simple inexpensive life of the past has given place to a more  complex way of living, which calls for greater expense and harder work.  It has created rivalry and jealousy to get the things that others have,  and has placed men in a mad race with each other which often leads to  jail or death.    Students of biology are constantly noting the difficulty that hereditary  human traits, which have been evolved for simple reactions and plain  living, find in making the necessary adjustments to the extravagant  demands and complicated environment of the present day. This departure  from the old normal and simple environment, due largely to machinery and  commerce, is not only destroying individual lives by the thousands, but  is seriously threatening the whole social fabric.    The creation of new courts, like \"Boys' Courts,\" \"Juvenile Courts,\"  \"Courts of Domestic Relations,\" \"Moral Courts,\" with their array of  \"Social Workers,\" \"Parole Agents,\" \"Watchers,\" _et cetera,_ shows the  growth of crime and likewise the hopelessness of present methods to deal  effectively with a great social question. Numbers of people in our big  cities are making their living from the abnormal lives of children.  Whether they are doing good or not, or whether their service is  unselfish, as much of it doubtless is, are both quite aside from the  question. The important fact is that the present system brings no  results and that the disease is growing.    Instead of any considerable number of people taking hold of the question  of crime, as physicians have taken hold of disease, and seeking to find  its cause and to remove that cause, we content ourselves with  prosecuting and punishing and visiting with misery and shame, not only  the boys and girls, the men and women, who are the victims of life, but  the large number of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons and  daughters, whose lives are ruined by a catastrophe with which at least  they had nothing to do. If a doctor were called in to treat a case of  typhoid fever, he would probably find out where the patient got his milk  supply and his drinking water and would have the well cleaned out to  stop the spread of typhoid fever through infection. A lawyer called to  treat the same kind of a case, legally speaking, would give the patient  thirty days in jail, thinking that this treatment would effect a cure.  If at the end of ten days the patient were cured, he would nevertheless  be kept in prison until his time was out. If at the end of thirty days  the disease was more infectious than ever, the patient would be  discharged and sent upon his way to spread contagion in his path.    The transgression of organized society in the treatment of crime would  not be so great if students and scientists had not long since found the  cause of crime. It would be hard to name a single man among all the men  of Europe and America who have given their time and thought to the  solution of this problem, who has not come to the conclusion that crime  has a natural origin, and that the criminal for the most part is the  victim of heredity and environment. These students have pointed the way  for the treatment of the disease, and yet organized government that  spends its millions on prosecutions, reformatories, jails,  penitentiaries and the like, has scarcely raised its hand or spent a  dollar to remove the cause of a disease that brings misery and despair  to millions and threatens the destruction of all social organization! To  the teaching of the student and the recommendations of the humane the  mob answers back: \"Give us more victims, bigger jails, stronger prisons,  more scaffolds!\"    Not only has the constant multiplication of penal laws helped without  avail to fill jails, but the failure to repeal laws that are outgrown  does its part. As already stated, there are many anti-social and  annoying things that can be done without violating the law. This, no  doubt, is responsible for some of the general statutes like that aimed  at the confidence game that catches a victim when the crime is not  clearly defined as in \"robbery,\" \"burglary,\" \"larceny\" and the like.  Still it has been the general opinion of those who have studied crime  and influenced the passage of penal laws, that criminal statutes should  be clear and explicit so that all would know what they must not do. It  is obvious that if one is to be punished simply for doing wrong, there  could be no judges or juries or jailers condemning and punishing and no  crowds shouting for vengeance. All do wrong and do it over and over  again, and day by day. It is not only those specific things that the  great majority think are wrong, but the graver offenses"]]]
