[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8659"],[0,"Sabbath in Puritan New England (#18)"],[1,"New Haven  Puritans, it was ordered that \"no money save silver or bills\" be accepted  by the deacons. After this order the deacons and elders found tremendous  difficulty in getting any contributions at all, and many are the records of  the actions and decisions of the church in regard to the perplexing matter.  It should be said, in justice to the New Haven colonists, though they were  the most opulent of the New England planters, save the wealthy settlers  of Narragansett, that money of all kinds was scarce, and that the Indian  money, wampum-peag, being made of a comparatively frail sea-shell, was more  easily disfigured and broken than was metal coin; and that there was little  transferable wealth in the community anyway, even in \"Country Pay.\" The  broken-wampum-giver of the seventeenth century, who contributed with intent  to defraud and deceive the infant struggling church was the direct and  lineal ancestor of the sanctimonious button-giver of nineteenth-century  country churches.    In Revolutionary times, after the divine service, special contributions  were taken for the benefit of the Continental Army. In New England large  quantities of valuable articles were thus collected. Not only money, but  finger-rings, earrings, watches, and other jewelry, all kinds of male  attire,--stockings, hats, coats, breeches, shoes,--produce and groceries of  all kinds, were brought to the meeting-house to give to the soldiers. Even  the leaden weights were taken out of the window-sashes, made into bullets,  and brought to meeting. On one occasion Madam Faith Trumbull rose up in  Lebanon meeting-house in Connecticut, when a collection was being made for  the army, took from her shoulders a magnificent scarlet cloak, which had  been a present to her from Count Rochambeau, the commander-in-chief of the  French allied army, and advancing to the altar, gave it as her offering to  the gallant men, who were fighting not only the British army, but terrible  want and suffering. The fine cloak was cut into narrow strips and used as  red trimmings for the uniforms of the soldiers. The romantic impressiveness  of Madam Trumbull's patriotic act kindled warm enthusiasm in the  congregation, and an enormous collection was taken, packed carefully, and  sent to the army.    One early duty of the deacons which was religiously and severely performed  was to watch that no one but an accepted communicant should partake of the  holy sacrament. One stern old Puritan, having been officially expelled from  church-membership for some temporal rather than spiritual offence, though  ignored by the all-powerful deacon, still refused to consider himself  excommunicated, and calmly and doggedly attended the communion service  bearing his own wine and bread, and in the solitude of his own pew communed  with God, if not with his fellow-men. For nearly twenty years did this  austere man rigidly go through this lonely and sad ceremonial, until he  conquered by sheer obstinacy and determination, and was again admitted to  church-fellowship.    A very extraordinary custom prevailed in several New England churches.  Through it the deacons were assigned a strange and serious duty which  appeared to make them all-important and possibly self-important, and  which must have weighed heavily upon them, were they truly godly, and  conscientious in the performance of it. In the rocky little town of Pelham  in the heart of Massachusetts, toward the close of the eighteenth century  and during the pastorate of the notorious thief, counterfeiter, and forger,  Rev. Stephen Burroughs, that remarkable rogue organized and introduced to  his parishioners the custom of giving during the month a metal check to  each worthy and truly virtuous church-member, on presentation of which the  check-bearer was entitled to partake of the communion, and without which he  was temporarily excommunicated. The duty of the deacon in this matter was  to walk up and down the aisles of the church at the close of each service  and deliver to the proper persons (proper in the deacon's halting human  judgment) the significant checks. The deacon had also to see that this  religionistic ticket was presented on the communion Sabbath. Great must  have been the disgrace of one who found himself checkless at the end of the  month, and greater even than the heart-burnings over seating the meeting  must have been the jealousies and church quarrels that arose over the  communion-checks. And yet no records of the protests or complaints of  indignant or grieving parishioners can be found, and the existence of  the too worldly, too business-like custom is known to us only through  tradition.    Many of the little chips called \"Presbyterian checks\" are, however, still  in existence. They are oblong discs of pewter, about an inch and a half  long, bearing the initials \"P. P.,\" which stand, it is said, for \"Pelham  Presbyterian.\" I could not but reflect, as I looked at the simple little  stamped slips of metal, that in a community so successful in the difficult  work of counterfeiting coin, it would have been very easy to form a mould  and cast from it spurious checks with which to circumvent the deacons and  preserve due dignity in the meeting.    The Presbyterian checks have never been attributed in Massachusetts to  other than the Pelham church, and are usually found in towns in the  vicinity of Pelham; and there the story of their purpose and use is  universally and implicitly believed. A clergyman of the Pelham church gave  to many of his friends these Presbyterian checks, which he had found among  the disused and valueless church-properties, and the little relics of the  old-time deacons and services have been carefully preserved.    In New Hampshire, however, a similar custom prevailed in the churches of  Londonderry and the neighboring towns.. The Londonderry settlers were  Scotch-Irish Presbyterians (and the Pelham planters were an off-shoot of  the Londonderry settlement), and they followed the custom of the Scotch  Presbyterians in convening the churches twice a year to partake of the  Lord's Supper. This assembly was always held in Londonderry, and ministers  and congregations gathered from all the towns around. Preparatory services  were held on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Long tables were placed in  the aisles of the church on the Sabbath; and after a protracted and solemn  address upon the deep meaning of the celebration and the duties of the  church-members, the oldest members of the congregation were seated at the  table and partook of the sacrament. Thin cakes of unleavened bread were  specially prepared for this sacred service. Again and again were the tables  refilled with communicants, for often seven hundred church-members were  present. Thus the services were prolonged from early morning until  nightfall. When so many were to partake of the Lord's Supper, it seemed  necessary to take means to prevent any unworthy or improper person from  presenting himself. Hence the tables were fenced off, and each communicant  was obliged to present a \"token.\" These tokens were similar to the  \"Presbyterian checks;\" they were little strips of lead or pewter stamped  with the initials \"L. D.,\" which may have stood for \"Londonderry\" or  \"Lord's Day.\" They were presented during the year by the deacons and elders  to worthy and pious church-members. This bi-annual celebration of the  Lord's Supper--this gathering of old friends and neighbors from the rocky  wilds of New Hampshire to join, in holy communion--was followed on Monday  by cheerful thanksgiving and social intercourse, in which, as in every  feast, our old friend, New England rum, played no unimportant part. The  three days previous to the communion Sabbath were, however, solemnly  devoted to the worship of God; a Londonderry man was reproved and  prosecuted for spreading grain upon a Thursday preceding a communion  Sunday, just as he would have been for doing similar work upon the Sabbath.  The use of these \"tokens\" in the Londonderry church continued until the  year 1830.    In the coin collection of the American Antiquarian Society are little  pewter communion-checks, or tokens, stamped with a heart. These were used  in the Presbyterian church in Philadelphia, and were delivered to pious  church-members at the Friday evening prayer-meeting preceding the communion  Sabbath. Long tables were set in the aisles, as at Londonderry. In  practice, belief, and origin, the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania churches  were sisters.    The deacons had many minor duties to perform in the different parishes.  Some of these duties they shared with the tithingman. They visited the  homes of the church-members to hear the children say the catechism, they  visited and prayed with the sick, and they also reported petty offences,  though they were not accorded quite so powerful legal authority as the  tithingmen and constables.    It was much desired by several of the first-settled ministers that there  should be deaconesses in the New England Puritan church, and many good  reasons were given for making such appointments. It was believed that  for the special duty of visiting the sick and afflicted in the community  deaconesses would be more useful than deacons. There had been an aged  deaconess in the Puritan church in Holland, who with a \"little birchen  rod\" had kept the children in awe and order in meeting, and who had also  exercised \"her guifts\" in speaking; but when she died no New England  successor was appointed to fill her place.
