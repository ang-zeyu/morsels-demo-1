I was returning with the overseer from examining the country some miles  in advance of the carts, and with the intention of encamping where I had  left them halted, when I found the men had followed my track into some  bad ground. After extricating them from it I proceeded three miles  further to Bidyengoga, which we did not reach until dark. Water was found  in the bed of the Lachlan on our penetrating through a broad margin of  reeds towards some lofty yarra trees. Latitude 34 degrees 12 minutes 17  seconds South; longitude 144 degrees 18 minutes East.    VISIT SOME RISING GROUND.    May 11.    Rising ground appeared on the horizon about four miles to the north-west,  and an intervening plain of firm clay covered with atriplex and salsolae  rose towards it from the very margin of the reedy basin of the river.  Although anxious to see the junction of the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee,  curiosity irresistible led me to the rising ground, while Mr. Stapylton  traced the supposed line of the Lachlan and the overseer conducted the  carts and party westward. Unlike the hills I had seen on the limits of  interior plains elsewhere, the ridge I now visited consisted of the same  rich loam as the plains themselves.    VIEW NORTHWARD.    It was connected with other low ridges which extended in a north-western  direction into a country finely diversified with hill, dale, and patches  of wood, but in all probability at that time entirely without water. The  dry bed of a lake lay in a valley immediately north of the hills on which  I stood. A few trees of stunted appearance alone grew in the hollow. On  the top of this ridge I ate a russet apple which had grown in my garden  at Sydney, and I planted the seeds in a spot of rich earth likely to be  saturated with water as often as it fell from the heavens.    DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING EITHER OF THE RIVERS OR ANY WATER.    Southward I could see no trace of the Lachlan, and I hastened towards the  highest trees where I thought it turned in that direction. I thus met the  track of the carts at rightangles and galloped after them as they were  driving through scrubs and over heaths away to the westward. When I  overtook them I found that Mr. Stapylton had crossed over to them and  told Burnett to say to me that he had not seen the Lachlan.    SEARCH FOR THE MURRUMBIDGEE.    A row of lofty yarra trees appeared to the southward and, as I expected  to find the Murrumbidgee among them, I directed my course thither,  travelling to the westward of south as well as any appearance of water  would allow. We passed through a scrub which swarmed with kangaroos,  bronze-wing pigeons, and cockatoos; also by a rather singular hollow  resembling the bed of a dry lake, in which we found several grasses  apparently new and very beautiful,* together with a low but  wide-spreading bush which bore a fruit resembling a cherry in size and  taste, but with a more elongated stone.    (*Footnote. A Poa near P. australis, R. Br. and Bromus australis of R.  Br.)    After descending into what I had thought was the bed of a river we found  unequal ground and saw, at a distance, patches of reeds, also lofty yarra  trees growing all about. On reaching the reeds we found they filled only  very slight hollows in the surface and, after passing through them, we  crossed another firm plain with atriplex and salsolae. No river was to be  seen, but another line of trees bounded this plain, exactly like those on  the banks of streams, and on reaching it I felt confident of finding  water; but on the contrary there was only an open forest of goodly trees  without the least indication of it.    A NIGHT WITHOUT WATER.    The sun had now set and I directed the people to encamp while I rode  forward in search of this river. Passing through a thick scrub I observed  another line of river trees, but I penetrated their shades with no better  success than before.    HEAVY FALL OF RAIN.    A dark and stormy night of wind and rain closed over us and,  notwithstanding the want of water which we were again destined to  experience, we got wet enough before we regained the camp. Mr. Stapylton  had arrived there before me without having seen either the Lachlan or the  Murrumbidgee in the course he had taken, and as the general bearings and  directions I had given him did not admit of his deviating too far from  the route of the carts he had been obliged to return unsuccessful. After  so long a day's journey the cattle were doomed to pass another night  yoked up, although surrounded by luxuriant pasture, for thus only could  we prevent them from straying in search of water. The rain however  moistened the grass on this as on three former occasions when we had  suffered the same privation; and the cattle were ordered to be loosened  to feed at the earliest dawn.    May 12.    It had rained heavily during the night so that water was no longer  scarce. The canoe brought from Waljeers had been placed to receive the  rain and conduct it into a cask which was thus filled.    TWO MEN MISSING.    On getting up I learnt that two men had set off in quest of water and had  been absent all night. That they should have taken this step without  first asking permission was wrong, but that nobody had mentioned the  circumstance to me till then was still more vexatious as, by firing shots  and throwing up rockets, these men might have found their way back in the  dark. I was very glad however to hear them at length answer our shots,  and not at all sorry to see them come in thoroughly drenched with the  empty kettles on their shoulders. After this I learnt, when we were about  to start, that six of the bullocks had got away; Piper however managed to  trace and bring them back. The weather then cleared up and we proceeded,  in a south-west direction as nearly as patches of scrub permitted, in  search of the Murrumbidgee; for I was then convinced, from the different  appearance of the country, that we had got beyond the junction of the  Lachlan. On passing the scrubs we crossed a plain of the same kind which  we had so often met. It sloped towards a belt of large trees in a flat,  where we also saw reeds, the ground there being very soft and heavy for  the draught animals. Passing this flat we again reached firm ground with  stately yarra trees; and charming vistas through miles of open forest  scenery had indeed nearly drawn me away from the bearing which was  otherwise most likely to hit the river.    REACH THE MURRUMBIDGEE.    I however continued to follow it and, in the midst of such scenery  without being at all aware that I was approaching a river, I suddenly saw  the water before me and stood at last on the banks of the Murrumbidgee.    This magnificent stream was flowing within eight feet of its banks with  considerable rapidity, the water being quite clear; and it really  exceeded so much my expectations (surpassing far the Darling and all the  Australian rivers I had then seen) that I was at first inclined to think  it could be nothing less than the Murray which, like the Darling, might  have been laid down too far to the west. At all events I was delighted to  find that this corner of Australia could supply at least one river worthy  of the name. After thirsting so long amongst the muddy holes of the  Lachlan I witnessed, with no slight degree of satisfaction, the jaded  cattle drinking at this full and flowing stream, resembling a thing of  life in its deep and rippling waters. Now at length there was an end to  the privations we had so often suffered from want of water; and the bank  was also clothed with excellent grass--a pleasing sight for the cattle.  Reeds appeared in patches back from the river but, unlike the banks of  the Darling, the best and clearest ground was on the immediate margin of  the Murrumbidgee.    NATIVES ON THE OPPOSITE BANK.    Piper, with that keenness of vision so peculiar in savages, soon descried  some natives on the other side, and pointed out to me a tribe filing in a  straggling line through the woods at a distance. I made him cooey to  them, they answered the call, and in a short time appeared on the  opposite bank. Our first interview with these sons of the woods was  highly creditable to them. They advanced in a numerous group, but in a  silent and submissive manner, each having a green bough twined round the  waist or in his hand. They sat down on the opposite bank and The Widow,  having taken a position exactly facing them, held a parley which  commenced before I could get to the spot. It was now that we learnt the  full value of this female, for it appeared that while some diffidence or  ceremony always prevents the male natives, when strangers to each other,  from speaking at first sight, no such restraint is imposed on the gins;  who with the privilege of their sex are ever ready to speak, and the  strangers as it seemed to answer; for thus at least we held converse with  this tribe across the river. Our female guide, who had scarcely before  ventured to look up, stood now boldly forward and addressed the strange  tribe in a very animated and apparently eloquent manner; and when her  countenance was thus lighted up, displaying fine teeth and great  earnestness of manner, I was delighted to perceive what soul the woman  possessed, and could not but consider our party fortunate in having met  with such an interpreter.    THEY SWIM ACROSS.    At length the strangers proposed swimming over to us and we invited them  to do so.    AFRAID OF THE SHEEP.    They then requested that those wild animals, the sheep and horses, might  be driven away, at which The Widow and Piper's gin laughed heartily, but  they were removed accordingly. The warriors of the Murrumbidgee were  about to plunge into the angry flood, desirous, no doubt, of showing off  like so many Caesars before these females, but their fears of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13053"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art, and Science — Volume 1, No. (#19)"],[1,"belt of beautiful evergreens and  flowering shrubs; and beyond these the lofty chestnut trees \"wave in  tender gloom,\" and form a leafy canopy to shelter that lonely tomb  from the winds of heaven. Solid, simple, and severe, it combines every  requisite in harmony with its solemn destination; no meretricious  ornaments, no false sentiment, mar the purity of its design. The  genius which devised it has succeeded in cheating the tomb of its  horrors, without depriving it of its imposing gravity. The simple  portal is surmounted by a plain massive cross of stone, and a door,  secured by an open work of bronze, leads into a sepulchral chamber,  the key of which had been confided to me.    All within breathes the holy calm of eternal repose; no gloom, no  mouldering damp, nothing to recall the dreadful images of decay. An  atmosphere of peace appears to pervade the place, and I could almost  fancy that a voice from the tomb whispered, in the words of Dante's  Beatrice--      \"Io sono in pace!\"    The light of the sun, streaming through a glazed aperture above  the door, fell like a ray of heavenly hope upon the symbol of man's  redemption--a beautiful copy, in bronze, of Michael Angelo's crucified  Savior--which is affixed to the wall facing the entrance. A simple  stone sarcophagus is placed on either side of the chamber, each one  surmounted by two white marble tablets, incrusted in the sloping  walls. That to the left incloses the coffin of Lady Blessington--that  to the right is still untenanted; long may it remain so!    The affection she most valued, the genius and talent she most admired,  have contributed to do honor to the memory of that gifted woman. Her  sepulchre is the creation of Alfred d'Orsay, her epitaphs are the  composition of Barry Cornwall and Walter Savage Landor. Upon the two  tablets placed over her tomb, are inscribed the following tributary  lines:--        \"In Memory of Marguerite Countess of Blessington, who died      on the 4th of June, 1849. In her lifetime she was loved and      admired for her many graceful writings, her gentle manners,      her kind and generous heart. Men famous for art and science,      in distant lands, sought her friendship; and the historians      and scholars, the poets, and wits, and painters of her own      country, found an unfailing welcome in her ever hospitable      home. She gave cheerfully, to all who were in need, help and      sympathy, and useful counsel; and she died lamented by many      friends. They who loved her best in life, and now lament her      most, have reared this tributary marble over her place of      rest.

The eye of faithful  affection watches over it as vigilantly as though the dust that sleeps  within were conscious of his care. But lately a sentiment of exquisite  tenderness suggested the addition of its most touching and appropriate  embellishment. A gentleman in the County Tipperary[5] had been  commissioned to send over to Chambourcy a root of ivy from Lady  Blessington's birthplace to plant near her grave. He succeeded in  obtaining an off-shoot from the parent stem that grows over the house  in which she was born. It has been transplanted to the foot of the  railing that surrounds her monument--it has taken root and spread--and  thus the same ivy that sheltered her cradle will overshadow her tomb!

We rise with a headache, and we set about puzzling  ourselves to know the cause. We then recollect that we had a hard  day's fag, or that we feasted over-bounteously, or that we stayed up  very late: at all events we incline to find out the fault, and then we  call ourselves fools for falling into it. Now, this is an occurrence  happening almost every day; and these are the points that run away  with the best portion of our life, before we find out what is for  good or evil. Let any single individual review his past life: how  instantaneously the blush will cover his cheek, when he thinks of  the egregious errors he has unknowingly committed--say unknowingly,  because it never occurred to him that they were errors until the  effects followed that betrayed the cause. All our sickness and  ailments, and a brief life, mainly depend upon ourselves. There are  thousands who practice errors day after day, and whose pervading  thought is, that everything which is agreeable and pleasing cannot be  hurtful. The slothful man loves his bed; the toper his drink, because  it throws him into an exhilarative and exquisite mood; the gourmand  makes his stomach his god; and the sensualist thinks his delights  imperishable. So we go on, and at last we stumble and break down. We  then begin to reflect, and the truth stares us in the face how much  we are to blame.           *       *       *       *       *    PROGRESS OF MILTON'S BLINDNESS.--It is now, I think, about ten years  (1654) since I perceived my vision to grow weak and dull; and, at  the same time I was troubled with pain in my kidneys and bowels,  accompanied with flatulency. In the morning, as I began to read, as  was my custom, my eyes instantly ached intensely, but were refreshed  after a little corporeal exercise. The candle which I looked at seemed  as if it were encircled by a rainbow. Not long after the sight of the  left part of the left eye (which I lost some years before the other)  became quite obscured, and prevented me from discerning any object  on that side. The sight in my other eye has now been gradually and  sensibly vanishing away for about three years; some months before it  had entirely perished, though I stood motionless, every thing which  I looked at seemed in motion to and fro. A stiff cloudy vapor seemed  to have settled on my forehead and temples, which usually occasions a  sort of somnolent pressure upon my eyes, and particularly from dinner  till evening. So that I often recollect what is said of the poet  Phineas in the Argonautics:      \"A stupor deep his cloudy temples bound,    And when he waked he seemed as whirling round,    Or in a feeble trance he speechless lay.\"    I ought not to omit that, while I had any sight left, as soon as I  lay down on my bed, and turned on either side, a flood of light used  to gush from my closed eyelids. Then, as my sight became daily more  impaired, the colors became more faint, and were emitted with a  certain crackling sound; but at present every species of illumination  being, as it were, extinguished, there is diffused around me nothing  but darkness, or darkness mingled and streaked with an ashy brown. Yet  the darkness in which I am perpetually immersed seems always, both by  night and day, to approach nearer to a white than black; and when the  eye is rolling in its socket, it admits a little particle of light  as through a chink. And though your physician may kindle a small ray  of hope, yet I make up my mind to the malady as quite incurable; and  I often reflect, that as the wise man admonishes, days of darkness  are destined to each of us. The darkness which I experience, less  oppressive than that of the tomb, is owing to the singular goodness  of the Deity, passed amid the pursuits of literature and the cheering  salutations of friendship. But if, as it is written, man shall not  live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth  of God, why may not any one acquiesce in the privation of his sight,  when God has so amply furnished his mind and his conscience with  eyes?--_Milton's Prose Works_.           *       *       *       *       *    \"ONCE CAUGHT, TWICE SHY.\"--\"Many years ago,\" says Mr. A. Smee, \"I  caught a common mouse in a trap, and instead of consigning it to the  usual watery grave or to the unmerciful claws of the cat, I determined  to keep it a prisoner. After a short time, the little mouse made its  escape in a room attached to my father's residence in the Bank of  England. I did not desire the presence of a wild mouse in this room,  and therefore adopted means to secure him. The room was paved with  stone, and inclosed with solid walls. There was no hope for him that  he would ultimately escape, although there were abundant opportunities  for hiding. I set the trap, and baited it with a savory morsel, but  day after day no mouse entered. The poor little thing gave unequivocal  signs of extreme"]]]
