There were easy  communications with the interior by the upper waters of the Columbia and  the lateral stream of the Oakinagan, while the downward current of the  Columbia furnished a highway to Astoria.    Availing himself, therefore, of the driftwood which had collected in  quantities in the neighboring bends of the river, Mr. Stuart and his men  set to work to erect a house, which in a little while was sufficiently  completed for their residence; and thus was established the first  interior post of the company. We will now return to notice the progress  of affairs at the mouth of the Columbia.          CHAPTER XI.         Alarm at Astoria.--Rumor of Indian Hostilities.--       Preparations for Defense.--Tragic Fate of the Tonquin.    THE sailing of the Tonquin, and the departure of Mr. David Stuart and  his detachment, had produced a striking effect on affairs at Astoria.  The natives who had swarmed about the place began immediately to drop  off, until at length not an Indian was to be seen. This, at first, was  attributed to the want of peltries with which to trade; but in a little  while the mystery was explained in a more alarming manner. A conspiracy  was said to be on foot among the neighboring tribes to make a combined  attack upon the white men, now that they were so reduced in number. For  this purpose there had been a gathering of warriors in a neighboring  bay, under pretext of fishing for sturgeon; and fleets of canoes were  expected to join them from the north and South. Even Comcomly, the  one-eyed chief, notwithstanding his professed friendship for Mr.  M'Dougal, was strongly suspected of being concerned in this general  combination.    Alarmed at rumors of this impending danger, the Astorians suspended  their regular labor, and set to work, with all haste, to throw up  temporary works for refuge and defense. In the course of a few days they  surrounded their dwelling-house and magazines with a picket fence  ninety feet square, flanked by two bastions, on which were mounted four  four-pounders. Every day they exercised themselves in the use of their  weapons, so as to qualify themselves for military duty, and at night  ensconced themselves in their fortress and posted sentinels, to guard  against surprise. In this way they hoped, even in case of attack, to be  able to hold out until the arrival of the party to be conducted by Mr.  Hunt across the Rocky Mountains, or until the return of the Tonquin. The  latter dependence, however, was doomed soon to be destroyed. Early in  August, a wandering band of savages from the Strait of Juan de Fuca made  their appearance at the mouth of the Columbia, where they came to fish  for sturgeon. They brought disastrous accounts of the Tonquin, which  were at first treated as fables, but which were too sadly confirmed by  a different tribe that arrived a few days subsequently. We shall relate  the circumstances of this melancholy affair as correctly as the casual  discrepancies in the statements that have reached us will permit.    We have already stated that the Tonquin set sail from the mouth of  the river on the fifth of June. The whole number of persons on board  amounted to twenty-three. In one of the outer bays they picked up,  from a fishing canoe, an Indian named Lamazee, who had already made  two voyages along the coast and knew something of the language of the  various tribes. He agreed to accompany them as interpreter.    Steering to the north, Captain Thorn arrived in a few days at  Vancouver's Island, and anchored in the harbor of Neweetee, very much  against the advice of his Indian interpreter, who warned him against the  perfidious character of the natives of this part of the coast. Numbers  of canoes soon came off, bringing sea-otter skins to sell. It was too  late in the day to commence a traffic, but Mr. M'Kay, accompanied by a  few of the men, went on shore to a large village to visit Wicananish,  the chief of the surrounding territory, six of the natives remaining on  board as hostages. He was received with great professions of friendship,  entertained hospitably, and a couch of sea-otter skins prepared for him  in the dwelling of the chieftain, where he was prevailed upon to pass  the night.    In the morning, before Mr. M'Kay had returned to the ship, great numbers  of the natives came off in their canoes to trade, headed by two sons of  Wicananish. As they brought abundance of sea-otter skins, and there was  every appearance of a brisk trade, Captain Thorn did not wait for  the return of Mr. M'Kay, but spread his wares upon the deck, making a  tempting display of blankets, cloths, knives, beads, and fish-hooks,  expecting a prompt and profitable sale. The Indians, however, were  not so eager and simple as he had supposed, having learned the art of  bargaining and the value of merchandise from the casual traders along  the coast. They were guided, too, by a shrewd old chief named Nookamis,  who had grown gray in traffic with New England skippers, and prided  himself upon his acuteness. His opinion seemed to regulate the market.  When Captain Thorn made what he considered a liberal offer for an  otter-skin, the wily old Indian treated it with scorn, and asked more  than double. His comrades all took their cue from him, and not an  otter-skin was to be had at a reasonable rate.    The old fellow, however, overshot his mark, and mistook the character of  the man he was treating with. Thorn was a plain, straightforward sailor,  who never had two minds nor two prices in his dealings, was deficient in  patience and pliancy, and totally wanting in the chicanery of traffic.  He had a vast deal of stern but honest pride in his nature, and,  moreover, held the whole savage race in sovereign contempt. Abandoning  all further attempts, therefore, to bargain with his shuffling  customers, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and paced up and down  the deck in sullen silence. The cunning old Indian followed him to and  fro, holding out a sea-otter skin to him at every turn, and pestering  him to trade. Finding other means unavailing, he suddenly changed his  tone, and began to jeer and banter him upon the mean prices he offered.  This was too much for the patience of the captain, who was never  remarkable for relishing a joke, especially when at his own expense.  Turning suddenly upon his persecutor, he snatched the proffered  otter-skin from his hands, rubbed it in his face, and dismissed him  over the side of the ship with no very complimentary application to  accelerate his exit. He then kicked the peltries to the right and left  about the deck, and broke up the market in the most ignominious manner.  Old Nookamis made for shore in a furious passion, in which he was  joined by Shewish, one of the sons of Wicananish, who went off breathing  vengeance, and the ship was soon abandoned by the natives.    When Mr. M'Kay returned on board, the interpreter related what had  passed, and begged him to prevail upon the captain to make sail, as from  his knowledge of the temper and pride of the people of the place, he was  sure they would resent the indignity offered to one of their chiefs. Mr.  M'Kay, who himself possessed some experience of Indian character,  went to the captain, who was still pacing the deck in moody humor,  represented the danger to which his hasty act had exposed the vessel,  and urged him to weigh anchor. The captain made light of his counsels,  and pointed to his cannon and fire-arms as sufficient safeguard against  naked savages. Further remonstrances only provoked taunting replies and  sharp altercations. The day passed away without any signs of hostility,  and at night the captain retired as usual to his cabin, taking no more  than the usual precautions.    On the following morning, at daybreak, while the captain and Mr. M'Kay  were yet asleep, a canoe came alongside in which were twenty Indians,  commanded by young Shewish. They were unarmed, their aspect and demeanor  friendly, and they held up otter-skins, and made signs indicative of  a wish to trade. The caution enjoined by Mr. Astor, in respect to the  admission of Indians on board of the ship, had been neglected for some  time past, and the officer of the watch, perceiving those in the canoe  to be without weapons, and having received no orders to the contrary,  readily permitted them to mount the deck. Another canoe soon succeeded,  the crew of which was likewise admitted. In a little while other canoes  came off, and Indians were soon clambering into the vessel on all sides.    The officer of the watch now felt alarmed, and called to Captain Thorn  and Mr. M'Kay. By the time they came on deck, it was thronged with  Indians. The interpreter noticed to Mr. M'Kay that many of the natives  wore short mantles of skins, and intimated a suspicion that they were  secretly armed. Mr. M'Kay urged the captain to clear the ship and get  under way. He again made light of the advice; but the augmented swarm of  canoes about the ship, and the numbers still putting off from shore, at  length awakened his distrust, and he ordered some of the crew to weigh  anchor, while some were sent aloft to make sail.    The Indians now offered to trade with the captain on his own terms,  prompted, apparently, by the approaching departure of the ship.  Accordingly, a hurried trade was commenced. The main articles sought by  the savages in barter were knives; as fast as some were supplied they  moved off, and others succeeded. By degrees they were thus distributed  about the deck, and all with weapons.    The anchor was now nearly up, the sails were loose, and the captain,  in a loud and peremptory tone, ordered the ship to be cleared. In an  instant, a signal yell was given; it was echoed on every side, knives  and war-clubs were brandished in every direction, and the savages rushed  upon their marked victims.    The first that fell was Mr. Lewis, the ship's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#19)"],[1,"--complexion, which was then called of extreme opinions, as  he had previously been editor of a legal newspaper called _Journal  du Palais_. _La Reforme_ had been originally conducted by Godefroy  Cavaignac, the brother of the general, who continued editor till the  period of the fatal illness which preceded his death. The defense  of Dupoty, tried and sentenced under the ministry of Thiers to five  years' imprisonment, as a regicide, because a letter was found open  in the letter-box of the paper of which he was editor, addressed to  him by a man said to be implicated in the conspiracy of Quenisset,  naturally brought M. Rollin into contact with many of the writers in  _La Reforme_; and these persons, among others Guinard Arago, Etienne  Arago, and Flocon, induced him to embark some portion of his fortune  in the paper. From one step he was led on to another, and ultimately  became one of the chief--indeed, if not the chief proprietor. The  speculation was far from successful in a pecuniary sense, but M.  Rollin, in furtherance of his opinions, continued for some years to  disburse considerable sums in the support of the journal. By this he  no doubt increased his popularity and his credit with the Republican  party, but it cannot be denied that he very materially injured his  private fortune. In the earlier portion of his career, M. Rollin was,  it is known, not indisposed to seek a seat in the Chamber, under the  auspices of M. Barrot, but subsequently to his connection with the  _Reforme_, he had himself become thoroughly known to the extreme party  in the departments, and on the death of Gamier Pages the elder, was  elected in 1841 for Le Mans, in La Sarthe.    In addressing the electors, after his return, M. Rollin delivered  a speech much more Republican than Monarchical. For this he was  sentenced to four months' imprisonment, but the sentence was appealed  against and annulled on a technical ground, and the honorable member  was ultimately acquitted by the Cour d'Assizes of Angers.    The parliamentary _debut_ of M. Rollin took place in 1842. His first  speech was delivered on the subject of the secret-service money.  The elocution was easy and flowing, the manner oratorical, the style  somewhat turgid and bombastic. But in the course of the session M.  Rollin improved, and his discourse on the modification of the criminal  law, on other legal subjects, and on railways, were more sober  specimens of style. In 1843 and 1844 M. Rollin frequently spoke; but  though his speeches were a good deal talked of outside the walls of  the Chamber, they produced little effect within it. Nevertheless,  it was plain to every candid observer that he possessed many of the  requisites of the orator--a good voice, a copious flow of words,  considerable energy and enthusiasm, a sanguine temperament and jovial  and generous disposition. In the sessions of 1845-46, M. Rollin took  a still more prominent part. His purse, his house in the Rue Tournon,  his counsels and advice, were all placed at the service of the  men of the movement; and by the beginning of 1847 he seemed to be  acknowledged by the extreme party as its most conspicuous and popular  member. Such indeed was his position when the electoral reform  banquets, on a large scale, began to take place in the autumn of 1847.  These banquets, promoted and forwarded by the principal members of the  opposition to serve the cause of electoral reform, were looked on  by M. Rollin and his friends in another light. While Odillon Barrot,  Duvergier d'Haurunne, and others, sought by means of them to produce  an enlarged constituency, the member for Sarthe looked not merely to  functional, but to organic reform--not merely to an enlargement of  the constituency, but to a change in the form of the government. The  desire of Barrot was _a la verite a la sincerite des institutions  conquises en Juillet_ 1830; whereas the desire of Rollin was, _a  l'amelioration des classes laborieuses_; the one was willing to go  on with the dynasty of Louis Philippe and the Constitution of July  improved by diffusion and extension of the franchise, the other  looked to a democratic and social republic. The result is now known.  It is not here our purpose to go over the events of the Revolution  of February 1848, but we may be permitted to observe, that the  combinations by which that event was effected were ramified and  extensive, and were long silently and secretly in motion.    The personal history of M. Rollin, since February 1848, is well-known  and patent to all the world. He was the _ame damnee_ of the  Provisional Government--the man whose extreme opinions, intemperate  circulars, and vehement patronage of persons professing the political  creed of Robespierre--indisposed all moderate men to rally around the  new system. It was in covering Ledru Rollin with the shield of his  popularity that Lamartine lost his own, and that he ceased to be the  political idol of a people of whom he must ever be regarded as one  of the literary glories and illustrations. On the dissolution of  the Provisional Government, Ledru Rollin constituted himself one of  the leaders of the movement party. In ready powers of speech and in  popularity no man stood higher; but he did not possess the power of  restraining his followers or of holding them in hand, and the result  was, that instead of being their leader he became their instrument.  Fond of applause, ambitious of distinction, timid by nature, destitute  of pluck, and of that rarer virtue moral courage, Ledru Rollin,  to avoid the imputation of faint-heartedness, put himself in the  foreground, but the measures of his followers being ill-taken, the  plot in which he was mixed up egregiously failed, and he is now in  consequence an exile in England.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERAL GARIBALDI.    MR. FILIPANTE gives the following notice of this Italian revolutionary  leader in a communication to the _Evening Post_. \"His exertions in  behalf of the liberal movement in Italy have been indefatigable. As  active as he was courageous, he was among the first to take up arms  against Austrian tyranny, and the last to lay them down. Even when the  triumvirate at Rome had been overthrown, and the most ardent spirits  despaired of the republic, Garibaldi and his noble band of soldiers  refused to yield; they maintained a vigorous resistance to the last,  and only quitted the ground when the cause was so far gone that their  own success would have been of no general advantage.    \"The General is about forty years of age. He was in early life an  officer in the Sardinian service, but, engaging in an unsuccessful  revolt against the government of Charles Albert, he was compelled to  leave his native land. He fled to Montevideo, where he fought with  distinction in the wars against Rosas. At the breaking out of the late  revolution he returned. His military capacities being well known, he  was entrusted with a command; and throughout the war his services were  most efficient. He defeated the allied troops of Austria, France,  and Naples, in several battles; his name, in fact, became a terror,  and when the republic fell, and he was compelled to retire to the  Appenines, the invaders felt that his return would be more formidable  than any other event.    \"From Italy he went to Morocco, where he has since lived. But his  friends, desiring that his great energies should be actively employed,  have offered him the command of a merchant ship, which he has  accepted. He will, therefore, hereafter be engaged in the peaceful  pursuits of commerce, unless his country should again require his  exertions.\"           *       *       *       *       *    CRIME, IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE.    In recent discussions of the effects of education upon morals, the  relative conditions of Great Britain and France in this respect  have often been referred to. The following paragraph shows that the  statistics in the case have not been well understood:    \"In a recent sitting of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences,  M. Leon Faucher, the representative, read a paper on the state of  crime in England; and some of the journals have taken advantage  of this to institute a comparison with returns of the criminality  of France, recently published by the Government--the result being  anything but flattering to England. But M. Faucher, the Academy, the  newspapers, and almost everybody else in France, seems to be entirely  ignorant that it is impossible to institute a comparison between the  amount of crime in England and the amount of crime in France, inasmuch  as crimes are not the same in both countries. Thus, for example, it  is a felony in England to steal a pair of shoes, the offender is sent  before the Court of Assize, and his offense counts in the official  returns as a \"crime;\" in France, on the contrary, a petty theft is  considered a _delit_, or simple offense, is punished by a police  magistrate, and figures in the returns as an \"offense.\" With  respect to murders, too, the English have only two general names for  killing--murder or manslaughter--but the French have nearly a dozen  categories of killing, of which what the English call murder forms  only one. It is the same, in short, with almost every species of  crime.\""]]]
