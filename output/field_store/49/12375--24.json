This was conspicuously so with Quetzalcoatl. As a divinity he is most  generally mentioned as the God of the Air and Winds. He was said to sweep  the roads before Tlaloc; god of the rains, because in that climate heavy  down-pours are preceded by violent gusts. Torquemada names him as \"God of  the Air,\" and states that in Cholula this function was looked upon as his  chief attribute,[1] and the term was distinctly applied to him  _Nanihe-hecatli_, Lord of the four Winds.    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. i, cap. v. Torquemada, _Monarquia  Indiana_, Lib. vi, cap. xxiv.]    In one of the earliest myths he is called _Yahualli ehecatl_, meaning \"the  Wheel of the Winds,\"[1] the winds being portrayed in the picture writing  as a circle or wheel, with a figure with five angles inscribed upon it,  the sacred pentagram. His image carried in the left hand this wheel, and  in the right a sceptre with the end recurved.    [Footnote 1: \"Quecalcoatl y por otro nombre yagualiecatl.\" Ramirez de  Fuen-leal, _Historia_, cap. i. _Yahualli_ is from the root _yaual_ or  _youal_, circular, rounding, and was applied to various objects of a  circular form. The sign of Quetzalcoatl is called by Sahagun, using the  native word, \"el _Yoel_ de los Vientos\" (_Historia_, ubi supra).]    Another reference to this wheel, or mariner's box, was in the shape of the  temples which were built in his honor as god of the winds. These, we are  informed, were completely circular, without an angle anywhere.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Se llaman (a Quetzalcoatl) Senor de el Viento * * * A este  le hacian las yglesias redondas, sin esquina ninguna.\" _Codex  Telleriano-Remensis_. Parte ii, Lam. ii. Describing the sacred edifices of  Mexico, Motolinia says: \"Habio en todos los mas de estos grandes patios un  otro templo que despues de levantada aquella capa quadrada, hecho su  altar, cubrianlo con una pared redonda, alta y cubierta con su chapital.  Este era del dios del aire, cual dijimos tener su principal sella en  Cholollan, y en toda esta provincia habia mucho de estos. A este dios del  aire llamaban en su lengua Quetzalcoatl,\" _Historia de los Indios_,  Epistola Proemial. Compare also Herrera, _Historia de las Indias  Occidentals_, Dec. ii, Lib. vii, cap. xvii, who describes the temple of  Quetzalcoatl, in the city of Mexico, and adds that it was circular,  \"porque asi como el Aire anda al rededor del Cielo, asi le hacian el  Templo redondo.\"]    Still another symbol which was sacred to him as lord of the four winds was  the Cross. It was not the Latin but the Greek cross, with four short arms  of equal length. Several of these were painted on the mantle which he wore  in the picture writings, and they are occasionally found on the sacred  jades, which bear other of his symbols.    This has often been made use of by one set of writers to prove that  Quetzalcoatl was some Christian teacher; and by others as evidence that  these native tales were of a date subsequent to the Conquest. But a  moment's consideration of the meaning of this cruciform symbol as revealed  in its native names shows where it belongs and what it refers to. These  names are three, and their significations are, \"The Rain-God,\" \"The Tree  of our Life,\" \"The God of Strength.\"[1] As the rains fertilize the fields  and ripen the food crops, so he who sends them is indeed the prop or tree  of our subsistence, and thus becomes the giver of health and strength. No  other explanation is needed, or is, in fact, allowable.    [Footnote 1: The Aztec words are _Quiahuitl teotl, quiahuitl_, rain,  _teotl_, god; _Tonacaquahuitl_, from _to_, our, _naca_, flesh or life,  _quahuitl_, tree; _Chicahualizteotl_, from _chicahualiztli_, strength or  courage, and _teotl_, god. These names are given by Ixtlilxochitl,  _Historia chichimeca_, cap. i.]    The winds and rains come from the four cardinal points. This fact was  figuratively represented by a cruciform figure, the ends directed toward  each of these. The God of the Four Winds bore these crosses as one of his  emblems. The sign came to be connected with fertility, reproduction and  life, through its associations as a symbol of the rains which restore the  parched fields and aid in the germination of seeds. Their influence in  this respect is most striking in those southern countries where a long dry  season is followed by heavy tropical showers, which in a few days change  the whole face of nature, from one of parched sterility to one of a wealth  of vegetable growth.    As there is a close connection, in meteorology, between the winds and the  rains, so in Aztec mythology, there was an equally near one between  Quetzalcoatl, as the god of the winds, and the gods of rain, Tlaloc and  his sister, or wife, or mother, Chalchihuitlicue. According to one myth,  these were created by the four primeval brother-gods, and placed in the  heavens, where they occupy a large mansion divided into four apartments,  with a court in the middle. In this court stand four enormous vases of  water, and an infinite number of very small slaves (the rain drops) stand  ready to dip out the water from one or the other vase and pour it on the  earth in showers.[1]    [Footnote 1: Ramirez de Fuen-leal, _Historia de los Mexicanos_, cap. ii.]    _Tlaloc_ means, literally, \"The wine of the Earth,\"[1] the figure being  that as man's heart is made glad, and his strength revived by the joyous  spirit of wine, so is the soil refreshed and restored by the rains.  _Tlaloc tecutli_, the Lord of the Wine of the Earth, was the proper title  of the male divinity, who sent the fertilizing showers, and thus caused  the seed to grow in barren places. It was he who gave abundant crops and  saved the parched and dying grain after times of drought. Therefore, he  was appealed to as the giver of good things, of corn and wine; and the  name of his home, Tlalocan, became synonymous with that of the terrestrial  paradise.    [Footnote 1: _Tlalli_, earth, _oc_ from _octli_, the native wine made from  the maguey, enormous quantities of which are consumed by the lower classes  in Mexico at this day, and which was well known to the ancients. Another  derivation of the name is from _tlalli_, and _onoc_, being, to be, hence,  \"resident on the earth.\" This does not seem appropriate.]    His wife or sister, Chalchihuitlicue, She of the Emerald Skirts, was  goddess of flowing streams, brooks, lakes and rivers. Her name, probably,  has reference to their limpid waters.[1] It is derived from  _chalchihuitl_, a species of jade or precious green stone, very highly  esteemed by the natives of Mexico and Central America, and worked by them  into ornaments and talismans, often elaborately engraved and inscribed  with symbols, by an art now altogether lost.[2] According to one myth,  Quetzalcoatl's mother took the name of _chalchiuitl_ \"when she ascended to  heaven;\"[3] by another he was engendered by such a sacred stone;[4] and by  all he was designated as the discoverer of the art of cutting and  polishing them, and the patron deity of workers in this branch.[5]    [Footnote 1: From _chalchihuitl_, jade, and _cueitl_, skirt or petticoat,  with the possessive prefix, _i_, her.]    [Footnote 2: See E.G. Squier, _Observations on a Collection of  Chalchihuitls from Central America_, New York, 1869, and Heinrich Fischer,  _Nephrit und Jadeit nach ihrer Urgeschichtlichen und Ethnographischen  Bedeutung_, Stuttgart, 1880, for a full discussion of the subject.]    [Footnote 3: _Codex Telleriano-Remensis_, Pt. ii, Lam. ii.]    [Footnote 4: See above, chapter iii, Sec.3]    [Footnote 5: Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. vi, cap. xxiv.]    The association of this stone and its color, a bluish green of various  shades, with the God of Light and the Air, may have reference to the blue  sky where he has his home, or to the blue and green waters where he makes  his bed. Whatever the connection was, it was so close that the festivals  of all three, Tlaloc, Chalchihuitlicue and Quetzalcoatl, were celebrated  together on the same day, which was the first of the first month of the  Aztec calendar, in February.[1]    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Hisioria_, Lib. ii, cap. i. A worthy but visionary  Mexican antiquary, Don J.M. Melgar, has recognized in Aztec mythology the  frequency of the symbolism which expresses the fertilizing action of the  sky (the sun and rains) upon the earth. He thinks that in some of the  manuscripts, as the _Codex Borgia_, it is represented by the rabbit  fecundating the frog. See his _Examen Comparativo entre los Signos  Simbolicos de las Teogonias y Cosmogonias antiguas y los que existen en  los Manuscritos Mexicanos_, p. 21 (Vera Cruz, 1872).]    In his character as god of days, the deity who brings back the diurnal  suns, and thus the seasons and years, Quetzalcoatl was the reputed  inventor of the Mexican Calendar. He himself was said to have been born on  Ce Acatl, One Cane, which was the first day of the first month, the  beginning of the reckoning, and the name of the day was often added to his  own.[1] As the count of the days really began with the beginning, it was  added that Heaven itself was created on this same day, Ce Acatl.[2]    [Footnote 1: _Codex Vaticanus_, Pl. xv.]    [Footnote 2: _Codex Telleriano Remensis_, Pl. xxxiii.]    In some myths Quetzalcoatl was the sole framer of the Calendar; in others  he was assisted by the first created pair, Cipactli and Oxomuco, who, as I  have said, appear to represent the Sky and the Earth. A certain cave in  the province of Cuernava (Quauhnauac) was pointed out as the scene of  their deliberations. Cipactonal chose the first name, Oxomuco the second,  and Quetzalcoatl the third, and so on in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#19)"],[1,"embarrassed; the more so, because the wearisome  nature of our journey had so fatigued the Frenchman that he was  hardly able any longer to sit upright in his saddle.    In this critical position I thought of the letter of recommendation  that Herr Geiger had given me in Rio Janeiro, for a German gentleman  of the name of Loskiel, who had settled here.  I had intended not to  deliver this letter until the next day, but \"necessity knows no  law,\" and so I paid my visit the same evening.    He was kind enough to interest himself for us in the warmest manner  imaginable.  He gave one of the gentlemen and myself lodgings in his  own house, and our two companions in that of a neighbour of his,  inviting all of us to dine at his table.  We now learned that in St.  Paulo no one, not even an hotel-keeper, will receive a stranger if  he be not provided with a letter of recommendation.  It is certainly  a lucky thing for travellers that this strange custom is not  prevalent everywhere.    16th December.  After having completely recovered ourselves from the  fatigues of our yesterday's ride, our first thought was to view the  curiosities of the town.  We asked our hospitable host for  information on this point, but he merely shrugged his shoulders, and  said, that he knew of no curiosities, unless, indeed, we chose to  look upon the Botanical Garden in the light of one.    We went out, therefore, after breakfast, and first of all viewed the  town:  where we found that the number of large and well-built houses  was, in comparison to the size of the two places, greater than in  Rio Janeiro, although even here, there was nothing like taste or  peculiar architectural style.  The streets are tolerably wide, but  present an extraordinarily deserted appearance, the universal  silence being broken only by the insupportable creaking of the  country people's carts.  These carts rest upon two wheels, or rather  two wooden disks, which are often not even hooped with iron to keep  them together.  The axle, which is likewise of wood, is never  greased, and thus causes the demoniacal kind of music to which I  alluded.    A peculiarity of dress, very remarkable in this hot climate, is here  prevalent:  all the men, with the exception of the slaves, wear  large cloth cloaks, one half of which they throw over their  shoulder; I even saw a great many women enveloped in long, broad  cloth capes.    In St. Paulo there is a High School.  Those who study there, and  come from the country or the smaller towns, are exposed to the  inconvenience of being refused lodgings under any one's roof.  They  are obliged to hire and furnish houses for themselves, and be their  own housekeepers.    We visited several churches which possess very little worth looking  at, either inside or out, and then concluded by proceeding to the  Botanical Garden, which also contains no object of any interest,  with the exception of a plantation of Chinese teas.    All our sight-seeing did not occupy us more than a few hours, and we  could very conveniently have begun our journey back to Santos the  next morning; but the Frenchman, who, on account of the great  fatigue he had suffered, had not accompanied us in our walk, begged  us to put off our return for half a day longer, and to arrange it in  such a manner, that we should pass the night in Rio Grande.  We  willingly acceded to his wish, and set out upon the afternoon of the  17th, after thanking our kind host most cordially for his hospitable  entertainment.  In Rio Grande we found an excellent supper,  convenient sleeping apartments, and a good breakfast the next  morning.  About 12 o'clock on the 18th of December, we arrived  safely in Santos, and the Frenchman then confessed to us he had felt  so fatigued on arriving at St. Paulo, from his long ride, that he  was afraid of being seriously ill.  However, he recovered himself  completely in a few days, but assured us, that it would be some time  before he again accompanied us on one of our trips.    The first question we put to the captain was:  \"When do you weigh  anchor?\" to which he very politely replied, that as soon as he had  cleared out 200 tons of coal, and shipped 6,000 sacks of sugar, he  should be ready to set sail, and in consequence of this we had to  remain three whole weary weeks in Santos.    We were still in Santos when we celebrated New-Year's Day, 1847, and  at last, on the 2nd of January, were lucky enough to bid the town  adieu; but did not proceed far, for in the first bay the wind fell,  and did not spring up again till after midnight.  It was now Sunday,  and no true Englishman will set sail on a Sunday; we remained,  therefore, lying at anchor the whole of the 3rd of January, looking  with very melancholy feelings after two ships, whose captains, in  spite of the holiness of the day, had profited by the fresh breeze,  and sailed gaily past us.    On the same evening we saw a vessel, which our captain affirmed was  a slaver, run into the bay.  It kept as far as possible from the  fort, and cast anchor at the most outward extremity of the bay.  As  the night was clear and moonlight we walked late upon deck, when,  true enough, we saw little boats laden with negroes pulling in  shore.  An officer, indeed, came from the fort to inquire into the  doings of this suspicious craft; but the owner seemed to afford him  a satisfactory account, for he left the ship, and the slaves  continued during the whole night to be quietly and undisturbedly  smuggled in as before.    On the morning of the 4th of January, as we sailed past the vessel,  we beheld a great number of the poor creatures still standing upon  the deck.  Our captain inquired of the slave-dealer how many slaves  he had had on board, and we learned with astonishment that the  number amounted to 670.  Much has already been said and written upon  this horrible trade; it is everywhere execrated, and looked upon as  a blot on the human race, and yet it still continues to flourish.    This day promised to turn out a very melancholy one in many  respects.  We had hardly lost sight of the slaver before one of our  own crew had nearly committed suicide.  The steward, a young  mulatto, had contracted the bad habit of indulging too much in  liquor.  The captain had often threatened to punish him severely,  but all to no purpose; and this morning he was so intoxicated that  the sailors were obliged to lay him in a corner of the forecastle,  where he might sleep himself sober.  Suddenly, however, he leapt up,  clambered on to the forepart of the ship, and threw himself into the  sea.  Luckily, it was almost a calm, the water was quite still, and  we had hopes of saving him.  He soon reappeared at the side of the  vessel, and ropes were thrown him from every side.  The love of life  was awakened in his breast, and caused him to grasp involuntarily at  the ropes, but he had not strength enough to hold on.  He again  sank, and it was only after great exertion that the brave sailors  succeeded in rescuing him from a watery grave.  Hardly had he  recovered his senses ere he endeavoured to throw himself in again,  exclaiming that he had no wish to live.  The man was raving mad, and  the captain was obliged to have him bound hand and foot, and chained  to the mast.  On the following day he was deprived of his office,  and degraded to the rank of subordinate to a new steward.    5th January.  Mostly calms.  Our cook caught, today, a fish three  feet long, and remarkable for the manner in which it changed colour.  When it came out of the water it was a bright yellow, to which  colour it owes its name of Dorado.  At the expiration of one or two  minutes the brilliant yellow changed into a light sky-blue, and  after its death its belly again turned to a beautiful light yellow,  but the back was a brownish green.  It is reckoned a great delicacy,  but, for my own part, I found its flesh rather dry.    On the 9th of January we were off the Rio Grande.  In the evening  everything seemed to promise a violent storm; the captain consulted  his barometer every second almost, and issued his orders according  to its indications.  Black clouds now began to drive towards us, and  the wind increased to such a pitch that the captain had all the  hatchways carefully fastened down, and the crew ready to reef the  sails at a moment's notice.  At a little past 8, the hurricane broke  forth.  Flash after flash of lightning darted across the horizon  from every side, and lighted the sailors in their work; the agitated  waves being illuminated with the most dazzling brilliancy.  The  majestic rolling of the thunder drowned the captain's voice, and the  white foaming billows broke with such terrific force over the deck,  that it appeared as if they would carry everything with them into  the depths of the ocean.  Unless there had been ropes stretched on  each side of the ship for the sailors to catch hold of, the latter  would most certainly have been washed away.  Such a storm as this  affords much food for reflection.  You are alone upon the boundless  ocean, far from all human help, and feel more than ever that your  life depends upon the Almighty alone.  The man who, in such a  dreadful and solemn moment, can still believe there is no God, must  indeed be irretrievably struck with mental blindness.  A feeling of  tranquil joy always comes over me during such great convulsions of  Nature. I very often had myself bound near the binnacle, and let the  tremendous waves break over me, in order to absorb, as it were, as  much of the spectacle before me as possible; on no occasion did I  ever feel alarmed, but always confident and resigned.    At the expiration of four hours the storm had worn itself out, and  was succeeded by a perfect calm.    On the 10th of January we caught sight of several sea-turtles and a  whale.  The latter was only a young one, about forty feet long.    11th January.  We were now off the Rio Plata, {59} and"]]]
