Then shone forth that grandeur of the human soul, which  displays itself in the hour of terror, as if to testify of the divine  image still existing amidst the wreck of us.  Whilst the Parliament was  flying from threatened Aix, and hurrying affrighted from town to town,  accompanied or pursued in its route by the commandant of the province,  all that while the Bishop of Marseilles, Monseigneur de Belzunce, the  sheriffs Estelle and Moustier, and a simple officer of health, Chevalier  Roze, sufficed in the depopulated town for all duties and all acts of  devotion.    The plague showed a preference for attacking robust men, young people,  and women in the flower of their age; it disdained the old and the sick;  there was none to care for the dying, none to bury the dead.  The doctors  of Marseilles had fled, or dared not approach the dying without  precautions, which redoubled the terror.  \"The doctors ought to be  abolished,\" wrote Dubois to the Archbishop of Aix, \"or ordered to show  more ability and less cowardice, for it is a great calamity.\"    Some young doctors, arriving from Montpellier, raised the courage of  their desponding brethren, and the sick no longer perished without help.  Rallying round the bishop, the priests, assisted by the members of all  the religious orders, flew from bedside to bedside, and from grave to  grave, without being able to suffice for the duties of their ministry.  \"Look at Belzunce,\" writes M. Lemontey; \"all he possessed, he has given;  all who served him are dead; alone, in poverty, afoot, in the morning he  penetrates into the most horrible dens of misery, and in the evening, he  is found again in the midst of places bespattered with the dying; he  quenches their thirst, he comforts them as a friend, he exhorts them as  an apostle, and on this field of death he gleans abandoned souls.  The  example of this prelate, who seems to be invulnerable, animates with  courageous emulation--not the clergy of lazy and emasculated dignitaries,  for they fled at the first approach of danger, but--the parish-priests,  the vicars and the religious orders; not one deserts his colors, not one  puts any bound to his fatigues save with his life.  Thus perished twenty-  six Recollects and eighteen Jesuits out of twenty-six.  The Capucins  summoned their brethren from the other provinces, and the latter rushed  to martyrdom with the alacrity of the ancient Christians; out of fifty-  five the epidemic slew forty-three.  The conduct of the priests of the  Oratory was, if possible, more magnanimous.  The functions of the sacred  ministry were forbidden them by the bishop, a fanatical partisan of the  bull Unigenitus; they refused to profit by their disqualification, and  they devoted themselves to the service of the sick with heroic humility;  nearly all succumbed, and there were still tears in the city for the  Superior, a man of eminent piety.\"    [Illustration: Belzunce amid the Plague-stricken----96]    During more than five months the heroic defenders of Marseilles struggled  against the scourge.  The bishop drew the populace on to follow in his  steps, in processions or in the churches, invoking the mercy of God in  aid of a city which terror and peril seemed to have the effect of  plunging into the most awful corruption.  Estelle, Moustier, and  Chevalier Roze, heading the efforts attempted in all directions to  protect the living and render the last offices to the dead, themselves  put their hands to the work, aided by galley-men who had been summoned  from the hulks.  Courage was enough to establish equality between all  ranks and all degrees of virtue.  Monseigneur de Belzunce sat upon the  seat of the tumbrel laden with corpses, driven by a convict stained with  every crime.    Marseilles had lost a third of its inhabitants.  Aix, Toulon, Arles, the  Cevennes, the Gevaudan were attacked by the contagion; fearful was the  want in the decimated towns long deprived of every resource.  The Regent  had forwarded corn and money; the pope sent out three ships laden with  provisions; one of the vessels was wrecked, the two others were seized by  Barbary pirates, who released them as soon as they knew their  destination.  The cargo was deposited on a desert island in sight of  Toulon.  Thither it was that boats, putting off from Marseilles, went to  fetch the alms of the pope, more charitable than many priests,  accompanying his gifts with all the spiritual consolations and  indulgences of his holy office.  The time had not come for Marseilles and  the towns of Provence to understand the terrible teaching of God.  Scarcely had they escaped from the dreadful scourge which had laid them  waste, when they plunged into excesses of pleasure and debauchery, as if  to fly from the memories that haunted them.  Scarcely was a thought given  to those martyrs to devotion who had fallen during the epidemic; those  who survived received no recompense; the Regent, alone, offered  Monseigneur de Belzunce the bishopric of Laon, the premier ecclesiastical  peerage in the kingdom; the saintly bishop preferred to remain in the  midst of the flock for which he had battled against despair and death.  It was only in 1802 that the city of Marseilles at last raised a monument  to its bishop and its heroic magistrates.    Dubois, meanwhile, was nearing the goal of all his efforts.  In order to  obtain the cardinal's hat, he had embraced the cause of the Court of  Rome, and was pushing forward the registration by Parliament of the Bull  Unigenitus.  The long opposition of the Duke of Noailles at last yielded  to the desire of restoring peace in the church.  In his wake the majority  of the bishops and communities who had made appeal to the contemplated  council, renounced, in their turn, the protests so often renewed within  the last few years.  The Parliament was divided, but exiled to Pontoise,  as a punishment for its opposition to the system of Law; it found itself  threatened with removal to Blois.  Chancellor d'Aguesseau had vainly  sought to interpose his authority; a magistrate of the Grand Chamber,  Perelle by name, was protesting eloquently against any derogation from  the principles of liberty of the Gallican Church and of the Parliaments.  \"Where did you find such maxims laid down?\"  asked the chancellor,  angrily.  \"In the pleadings of the late Chancellor d'Aguesseau,\" answered  the councillor, icily.  D'Aguesseau gave in his resignation to the  Regent; the Parliament did not leave for Blois; after sitting some weeks  at Pontoise, it enregistered the formal declaration of the Bull, and at  last returned to Paris on the, 20th of December, 1720.    Dubois had reconciled France with the court of Rome; the latter owed him  recompense for so much labor.  Clement XI. had promised, but he could not  make up his mind to bring down so low the dignity of the Sacred College;  he died without having conferred the hat upon Dubois.  During the  conclave intrigues recommenced, conducted this time by Cardinal Rohan.  The Jesuit Lafitteau, who had become Bishop of Sisteron, and had for a  long while been the secret agent of Dubois at Rome, kept him acquainted  with all the steps taken to wrest a promise from Cardinal Conti, who was  destined, it was believed, to unite the majority of the suffrages.  \"Do  not be surprised,\" he adds, \"to hear me say that I go by night to the  conclave, for I have found out the secret of getting the key of it, and I  constantly pass through five or six guard-posts, without their being able  to guess who I am.\"    Cardinal Conti was old and feeble; all means were brought to bear upon  him.  Dubois had for a long time past engaged the services of Chevalier  St. George; when the new pope was proclaimed, under the name of Innocent  XIII., he had signed a conditional promise in favor of Dubois.  The  Regent, who had but lately pressed his favorite's desires upon Clement  XI., was not afraid to write to the new pontiff--    \"MOST HOLY FATHER,    \"Your Holiness is informed of the favor which the late pope had granted  me on behalf of the Archbishop of Cambrai, of which his death alone  prevented the fulfilment.  I hope that Your Holiness will let it be seen,  on your accession to the throne of St. Peter, that services rendered to  the Church lose nothing by the death of the sovereign pontiffs, and that  you will not think it unworthy of your earliest care to give me this  public mark of the attention paid by the Holy See to the zeal which I  profess for its interests.  This kindness on the part of Your Holiness  will crown the wishes I formed for your exaltation, will fill up the  measure of the joy which it has caused me, will maintain our kindly  relations to the advantage of the peace of the Church and the authority  of the Holy See, and will fortify the zeal of the Archbishop of Cambrai  in the execution of my orders to the glory of the Pontificate and of Your  Holiness.\"      On the 16th of July, 1721, Dubois was at last elected Cardinal; it was  stated that his elevation had cost eight millions of livres.  The  frivolous curiosity of the court was concerned with the countenance the  new Eminence would make in his visits of ceremony, especially in that to  Madame, his declared foe at all times.  \"He had nearly two months to  prepare for it,\" says St. Simon, and it must be admitted that he had made  good use of them.  He got himself up for his part, and appeared before  Madame with deep respect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV. (#19)"],[1,"of Dunkirk  considered, in defence of that Guardian, in a letter to the bailiff  of Stockbridge: The French Faith represented in the present state of  Dunkirk: The Crisis, a Letter to a Member of Parliament, concerning  the bill to prevent the present Growth of Schism, dated May 28, 1714;  and his Apology for himself and his Writings.    These pieces shew how much he was displeased with the last measures  of Queen Anne, and were written to combat the Tory ministry; to oppose  which he set about procuring a seat in Parliament; for which purpose  he resigned his place of commissioner of the stamp-office, in June  1713, in a letter to the earl of Oxford, lord high treasurer, and was  chosen member of the House of Commons, for the Borough of Stockbridge.  But he did not long enjoy his seat in that house before he was  expelled, on the 18th of March 1713, for writing the Englishman, being  the close of the paper so called; and the Crisis[B].    In 1714 he published the Romish Ecclesiastical History of late years,  and a paper intitled The Lover; the first of which appeared Thursday  February 25, 1714, and another intitled the Reader, which began on  Thursday April 22, the same year. In the sixth Number of this last  paper, he gave an account of his design of writing the History of  the Duke of Marlborough, from proper materials in his custody: the  relation to commence from the date of his grace's commission, as  captain-general, and plenipotentiary; and to end with the expiration  of these commissions. But this noble design he lived not to execute,  and the materials were afterwards returned to the duchess of  Marlborough, who left them to Mr. Mallet, with a handsome gratuity for  the execution of Sir Richard's design.    Soon after the accession of king George the 1st to the throne, Mr.  Steele was appointed surveyor of the royal stables at Hampton-Court,  and governor of the royal company of Comedians, by a patent, dated  January 19, 1714-15. He was likewise put into the commission of the  peace for the county of Middlesex; and in April 1715 received the  honour of knighthood from his majesty. In the first parliament of that  king, he was chosen for Borough-brigg in Yorkshire; and after the  suppressing the Rebellion in the North, was appointed one of the  commissioners of the forfeited estates in Scotland, where he received  from several of the nobility and gentry of that part of the united  kingdom the most distinguishing marks of respect. He contracted a  friendship while in Scotland, with one Hart, a Presbyterian minister  in Edinburgh, whom he afterwards honoured with his correspondence:  This Hart he used merrily to stile the Hangman of the Gospel, for  though he was a facetious good-natur'd man, yet he had fallen into a  peculiar way of preaching what he called the Terrors of the Law, and  denounced anathemas from the pulpit without reserve.    Sir Richard held frequent conversations with Hart, and other  ministers, concerning the restoration of episcopacy, the antient  church-government of that nation, and often observed that it was pity,  when the two kingdoms were united in language, in dress, in politics,  and in all essential points, even in religion, should yet be divided  in the ecclesiastical administration, which still serves to maintain a  kind of alienation between the people. He found many of the Scots  well disposed towards prelacy; but the generality, who were taught  to contemplate the church of England, with as much horror as that of  Rome, could not soon be prevailed upon to return to it.    Sir Richard wished well to the interests of religion, and as he  imagined that Union would promote it, he had some thoughts of  proposing it at court, but the times were unfavourable. The  Presbyterians had lately appeared active against the rebels, and were  not to be disobliged; but such is now the good understanding between  the episcopal and presbyterian parties, that a few concessions on the  one side, and not many advances on the other, possibly might produce  an amicable coalition, as it is chiefly in form, rather than in  articles of religion, in which they differ.    In the year 1715 he published an account of the state of the Roman  Catholic Religion throughout the World, translated from an Italian  manuscript, with a dedication to the Pope, giving him a very  particular account of the state of religion amongst the Protestants,  and several other matters of importance, relating to Great-Britain;  but this dedication is supposed to be written by another very eminent  hand, more conversant in subjects of that nature than Sir Richard.    The same year our author published a Letter from the earl of Marr to  the king, before his majesty's arrival in England; with some remarks  on my lord's subsequent conduct; and the year following a second  volume of the Englishman, and in 1718 an account of a Fish-Pool, which  was a project of his for bringing fish to market alive, for which he  obtained a patent.    In 1719 he published a pamphlet called the Spinster, and a Letter  to the Earl of Oxford, concerning the Bill of Peerage, which bill he  opposed in the House of Commons. Some time after, he wrote against the  South-Sea-Scheme; his Crisis of posterity; and another piece intitled,  A Nation a Family; and on Saturday January the 2d, 1719-20, he began  a paper called the Theatre, during the course of which his patent of  governor of the Royal Company of Comedians, being suspended by his  majesty, he published, The State of the Case.    In the year 1722, he brought his Conscious Lovers on the stage, with  prodigious success. This is the last and most finished of all Sir  Richard's Comedies, and 'tis doubtful if there is upon the stage, any  more instructing; that tends to convey a finer moral, or is better  conducted in its design. We have already observed, that it is  impossible to witness the tender scenes of this Comedy without  emotion; that is, no man of feeling and humanity, who has experienced  the delicate solicitudes of love and affection, can do it. Sir Richard  has told us, that when one of the players told Mr. Wilks, that there  was a General weeping for Indiana; he politely observed, that he  would not fight the worse for that; and indeed what a noble school  of morality would the stage be, if all those who write for it would  observe such delicate chastity; they would then inforce an honourable  and virtuous deportment, by the most insinuating and easy means;  they would so allure the audience by the amiable form of goodness  represented in her native loveliness, that he who could resist her  charms, must be something more than wicked.    When Sir Richard finished this Comedy, the parts of Tom and Phillis  were not then in it: He read it to Mr. Cibber, who candidly told him,  that though he liked his play upon the whole, both in the cast of the  characters and execution of them; yet, that it was rather too grave  for an English audience, who want generally to laugh at a Comedy, and  without which in their opinion, the end is not answered. Mr. Cibber  then proposed the addition of some comic characters, with which Sir  Richard agreed, and saw the propriety and force of the observation.  This comedy (at Sir Richard's request) received many additions from,  and were greatly improved by Mr. Cibber.--Our author dedicated this  work to the king, who made him a present of 500 l.    Some years before his death, he grew paralytic, and retired to his  seat at Langunner, near Caermarthen in Wales, where he died September  the 1st, 1729; and was privately interred according to his own desire,  in the church of Caermarthen.    Besides his writings above-mentionened, he began on Saturday the 17th  of December, a weekly paper in quarto, called the Town-Talk, in a  letter to a lady in the country; and another, intitled the Tea-Table:  He had likewise planned a comedy which he intended to call The School  of Action.--As Sir Richard was beloved when living, so his loss was  sincerely regretted at his death. He was a man of undissembled, and  extensive benevolence; a friend to the friendless, and as far as his  circumstances would permit, the father of every orphan: His works  are chaste, and manly, he himself admired virtue, and he drew her as  lovely as she is: of his works it may be said, as Sir George Lyttleton  in his prologue to Coriolanus observes of Thomson, that there are not  in them      One corrupted, one immoral thought,    A line which dying he could wish to blot.    He was a stranger to the most distant appearance of envy or  malevolence, never jealous of any man's growing reputation, and so far  from arrogating any praise to himself, from his conjunction with Mr.  Addison, that he was the first who desired him to distinguish his  papers in the Spectator, and after the death of that great man was a  faithful executor of his fame, notwithstanding an aspersion which Mr.  Tickell was so unjust to throw upon him. Sir Richard's greatest error  was want of oeconomy, as appears from the two following instances  related by the elegant writer of Mr. Savage's Life, to whom that  gentleman communicated them.    'Savage was once desired by Sir Richard, with an air of the utmost  importance, to come very early to his house the next morning. Mr.  Savage came as he had promised, found the chariot at the door, and  Sir Richard waiting for him ready to go out. What was intended, and  whither they were to go, Savage could not conjecture, and was not  willing to inquire, but immediately seated himself with Sir Richard:  The coachman was ordered to drive, and they hurried with the utmost  expedition to Hyde-Park Corner, where they stopped at a petty tavern,  and retired to a private room. Sir Richard then informed him, that  he intended to publish a pamphlet, and that he desired him to come  thither, that he might write for him. They soon sat down to the work,  Sir Richard dictated, and Savage wrote,"]]]
