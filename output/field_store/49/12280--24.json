Take me to him. I want  them to arrest me too. I love him.... I could not live without him....\"    An impulse of sympathy made Hortense put her arms around the girl's neck  and say warmly:    \"Yes, come. He is not dead, I am sure, only wounded; and Prince Renine will  save him. You will, won't you, Renine?... Come. Make up a story for your  servant: say that you're going somewhere by train and that she is not to  tell anybody. Be quick. Put on a wrap. We will save him, I swear we will.\"    Rose Andree went indoors and returned almost at once, disguised beyond  recognition in a long cloak and a veil that shrouded her face; and they all  took the road back to Routot. At the inn, Rose Andree passed as a friend  whom they had been to fetch in the neighbourhood and were taking to Paris  with them. Renine ran out to make enquiries and came back to the two women.    \"It's all right. Dalbreque is alive. They have put him to bed in a private  room at the mayor's offices. He has a broken leg and a rather high  temperature; but all the same they expect to move him to Rouen to-morrow  and they have telephoned there for a motor-car.\"    \"And then?\" asked Rose Andree, anxiously.    Renine smiled:    \"Why, then we shall leave at daybreak. We shall take up our positions in a  sunken road, rifle in hand, attack the motor-coach and carry off Georges!\"    \"Oh, don't laugh!\" she said, plaintively. \"I am so unhappy!\"    But the adventure seemed to amuse Renine; and, when he was alone with  Hortense, he exclaimed:    \"You see what comes of preferring dishonour to death! But hang it all, who  could have expected this? It isn't a bit the way in which things happen  in the pictures! Once the man of the woods had carried off his victim and  considering that for three weeks there was no one to defend her, how could  we imagine--we who had been proceeding all along under the influence of  the pictures--that in the space of a few hours the victim would become a  princess in love? Confound that Georges! I now understand the sly, humorous  look which I surprised on his mobile features! He remembered, Georges did,  and he didn't care a hang for me! Oh, he tricked me nicely! And you, my  dear, he tricked you too! And it was all the influence of the film. They  show us, at the cinema, a brute beast, a sort of long-haired, ape-faced  savage. What can a man like that be in real life? A brute, inevitably,  don't you agree? Well, he's nothing of the kind; he's a Don Juan! The  humbug!\"    \"You will save him, won't you?\" said Hortense, in a beseeching tone.    \"Are you very anxious that I should?\"    \"Very.\"    \"In that case, promise to give me your hand to kiss.\"    \"You can have both hands, Renine, and gladly.\"    The night was uneventful. Renine had given orders for the two ladies to  be waked at an early hour. When they came down, the motor was leaving the  yard and pulling up in front of the inn. It was raining; and Adolphe, the  chauffeur, had fixed up the long, low hood and packed the luggage inside.    Renine called for his bill. They all three took a cup of coffee. But, just  as they were leaving the room, one of the inspector's men came rushing in:    \"Have you seen him?\" he asked. \"Isn't he here?\"    The inspector himself arrived at a run, greatly excited:    \"The prisoner has escaped! He ran back through the inn! He can't be far  away!\"    A dozen rustics appeared like a whirlwind. They ransacked the lofts, the  stables, the sheds. They scattered over the neighbourhood. But the search  led to no discovery.    \"Oh, hang it all!\" said Renine, who had taken his part in the hunt. \"How  can it have happened?\"    \"How do I know?\" spluttered the inspector in despair. \"I left my three men  watching in the next room. I found them this morning fast asleep, stupefied  by some narcotic which had been mixed with their wine! And the Dalbreque  bird had flown!\"    \"Which way?\"    \"Through the window. There were evidently accomplices, with ropes and a  ladder. And, as Dalbreque had a broken leg, they carried him off on the  stretcher itself.\"    \"They left no traces?\"    \"No traces of footsteps, true. The rain has messed everything up. But they  went through the yard, because the stretcher's there.\"    \"You'll find him, Mr. Inspector, there's no doubt of that. In any case, you  may be sure that you won't have any trouble over the affair. I shall be in  Paris this evening and shall go straight to the prefecture, where I have  influential friends.\"    Renine went back to the two women in the coffee-room and Hortense at once  said:    \"It was you who carried him off, wasn't it? Please put Rose Andree's mind  at rest. She is so terrified!\"    He gave Rose Andree his arm and led her to the car. She was staggering and  very pale; and she said, in a faint voice:    \"Are we going? And he: is he safe? Won't they catch him again?\"    Looking deep into her eyes, he said:    \"Swear to me, Rose Andree, that in two months, when he is well and when  I have proved his innocence, swear that you will go away with him to  America.\"    \"I swear.\"    \"And that, once there, you will marry him.\"    \"I swear.\"    He spoke a few words in her ear.    \"Ah!\" she said. \"May Heaven bless you for it!\"    Hortense took her seat in front, with Renine, who sat at the wheel. The  inspector, hat in hand, fussed around the car until it moved off.    They drove through the forest, crossed the Seine at La Mailleraie and  struck into the Havre-Rouen road.    \"Take off your glove and give me your hand to kiss,\" Renine ordered. \"You  promised that you would.\"    \"Oh!\" said Hortense. \"But it was to be when Dalbreque was saved.\"    \"He is saved.\"    \"Not yet. The police are after him. They may catch him again. He will not  be really saved until he is with Rose Andree.\"    \"He is with Rose Andree,\" he declared.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Turn round.\"    She did so.    In the shadow of the hood, right at the back, behind the chauffeur, Rose  Andree was kneeling beside a man lying on the seat.    \"Oh,\" stammered Hortense, \"it's incredible! Then it was you who hid him  last night? And he was there, in front of the inn, when the inspector was  seeing us off?\"    \"Lord, yes! He was there, under the cushions and rugs!\"    \"It's incredible!\" she repeated, utterly bewildered. \"It's incredible! How  were you able to manage it all?\"    \"I wanted to kiss your hand,\" he said.    She removed her glove, as he bade her, and raised her hand to his lips.    The car was speeding between the peaceful Seine and the white cliffs that  border it. They sat silent for a long while. Then he said:    \"I had a talk with Dalbreque last night. He's a fine fellow and is ready  to do anything for Rose Andree. He's right. A man must do anything for  the woman he loves. He must devote himself to her, offer her all that is  beautiful in this world: joy and happiness ... and, if she should be bored,  stirring adventures to distract her, to excite her and to make her smile  ... or even weep.\"    Hortense shivered; and her eyes were not quite free from tears. For the  first time he was alluding to the sentimental adventure that bound them by  a tie which as yet was frail, but which became stronger and more enduring  with each of the ventures on which they entered together, pursuing them  feverishly and anxiously to their close. Already she felt powerless and  uneasy with this extraordinary man, who subjected events to his will and  seemed to play with the destinies of those whom he fought or protected. He  filled her with dread and at the same time he attracted her. She thought of  him sometimes as her master, sometimes as an enemy against whom she must  defend herself, but oftenest as a perturbing friend, full of charm and  fascination....          V    THERESE AND GERMAINE      The weather was so mild that autumn that, on the 12th of October, in the  morning, several families still lingering in their villas at Etretat had  gone down to the beach. The sea, lying between the cliffs and the clouds on  the horizon, might have suggested a mountain-lake slumbering in the hollow  of the enclosing rocks, were it not for that crispness in the air and those  pale, soft and indefinite colours in the sky which give a special charm to  certain days in Normandy.    \"It's delicious,\" murmured Hortense. But the next moment she added: \"All  the same, we did not come here to enjoy the spectacle of nature or to  wonder whether that huge stone Needle on our left was really at one time  the home of Arsene Lupin.\"    \"We came here,\" said Prince Renine, \"because of the conversation which I  overheard, a fortnight ago, in a dining-car, between a man and a woman.\"    \"A conversation of which I was unable to catch a single word.\"    \"If those two people could have guessed for an instant that it was possible  to hear a single word of what they were saying, they would not have spoken,  for their conversation was one of extraordinary gravity and importance. But  I have very sharp ears; and though I could not follow every sentence, I  insist that we may be certain of two things. First, that man and woman, who  are brother and sister, have an appointment at a quarter to twelve this  morning, the 12th of October, at the spot known as the Trois Mathildes,  with a third person, who is married and who wishes at all costs to recover  his or her liberty. Secondly, this appointment, at which they will come  to a final agreement, is to be followed this evening by a walk along the  cliffs, when the third person will bring with him or her the man or woman,  I can't definitely say which, whom they want to get rid of. That is the  gist of the whole thing. Now, as I know a spot called the Trois Mathildes  some way above Etretat and as this is not an everyday name, we came down  yesterday to thwart the plan of these objectionable persons.\"    \"What plan?\" asked Hortense. \"F"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#18)"],[1,"it? What  monstrous conception is this? my brother!    No; protection, and not injury is his province. Strange and terrible  chimera! Yet it would not be suddenly dismissed. It was surely no vulgar  agency that gave this form to my fears. He to whom all parts of time are  equally present, whom no contingency approaches, was the author of that  spell which now seized upon me. Life was dear to me. No consideration  was present that enjoined me to relinquish it. Sacred duty combined  with every spontaneous sentiment to endear to me my being. Should I not  shudder when my being was endangered? But what emotion should possess me  when the arm lifted aginst me was Wieland's?    Ideas exist in our minds that can be accounted for by no established  laws. Why did I dream that my brother was my foe? Why but because an  omen of my fate was ordained to be communicated? Yet what salutary end  did it serve? Did it arm me with caution to elude, or fortitude to bear  the evils to which I was reserved? My present thoughts were, no  doubt, indebted for their hue to the similitude existing between these  incidents and those of my dream. Surely it was phrenzy that dictated my  deed. That a ruffian was hidden in the closet, was an idea, the genuine  tendency of which was to urge me to flight. Such had been the effect  formerly produced. Had my mind been simply occupied with this thought at  present, no doubt, the same impulse would have been experienced; but  now it was my brother whom I was irresistably persuaded to regard as the  contriver of that ill of which I had been forewarned. This persuasion  did not extenuate my fears or my danger. Why then did I again approach  the closet and withdraw the bolt? My resolution was instantly conceived,  and executed without faultering.    The door was formed of light materials. The lock, of simple structure,  easily forewent its hold. It opened into the room, and commonly moved  upon its hinges, after being unfastened, without any effort of mine.  This effort, however, was bestowed upon the present occasion. It was  my purpose to open it with quickness, but the exertion which I made was  ineffectual. It refused to open.    At another time, this circumstance would not have looked with a face of  mystery. I should have supposed some casual obstruction, and repeated my  efforts to surmount it. But now my mind was accessible to no conjecture  but one. The door was hindered from opening by human force. Surely, here  was new cause for affright. This was confirmation proper to decide my  conduct. Now was all ground of hesitation taken away. What could be  supposed but that I deserted the chamber and the house? that I at least  endeavoured no longer to withdraw the door?    Have I not said that my actions were dictated by phrenzy? My reason had  forborne, for a time, to suggest or to sway my resolves. I reiterated  my endeavours. I exerted all my force to overcome the obstacle, but in  vain. The strength that was exerted to keep it shut, was superior to  mine.    A casual observer might, perhaps, applaud the audaciousness of this  conduct. Whence, but from an habitual defiance of danger, could my  perseverance arise? I have already assigned, as distinctly as I am able,  the cause of it. The frantic conception that my brother was within, that  the resistance made to my design was exerted by him, had rooted itself  in my mind. You will comprehend the height of this infatuation, when  I tell you, that, finding all my exertions vain, I betook myself to  exclamations. Surely I was utterly bereft of understanding.    Now had I arrived at the crisis of my fate. \"O! hinder not the door to  open,\" I exclaimed, in a tone that had less of fear than of grief in  it. \"I know you well. Come forth, but harm me not. I beseech you come  forth.\"    I had taken my hand from the lock, and removed to a small distance from  the door. I had scarcely uttered these words, when the door swung upon  its hinges, and displayed to my view the interior of the closet. Whoever  was within, was shrouded in darkness. A few seconds passed without  interruption of the silence. I knew not what to expect or to fear. My  eyes would not stray from the recess. Presently, a deep sigh was heard.  The quarter from which it came heightened the eagerness of my gaze. Some  one approached from the farther end. I quickly perceived the outlines  of a human figure. Its steps were irresolute and slow. I recoiled as it  advanced.    By coming at length within the verge of the room, his form was clearly  distinguishable. I had prefigured to myself a very different personage.  The face that presented itself was the last that I should desire to meet  at an hour, and in a place like this. My wonder was stifled by my fears.  Assassins had lurked in this recess. Some divine voice warned me of  danger, that at this moment awaited me. I had spurned the intimation,  and challenged my adversary.    I recalled the mysterious countenance and dubious character of Carwin.  What motive but atrocious ones could guide his steps hither? I was  alone. My habit suited the hour, and the place, and the warmth of the  season. All succour was remote. He had placed himself between me and the  door. My frame shook with the vehemence of my apprehensions.    Yet I was not wholly lost to myself: I vigilantly marked his demeanour.  His looks were grave, but not without perturbation. What species of  inquietude it betrayed, the light was not strong enough to enable me  to discover. He stood still; but his eyes wandered from one object to  another. When these powerful organs were fixed upon me, I shrunk into  myself. At length, he broke silence. Earnestness, and not embarrassment,  was in his tone. He advanced close to me while he spoke.    \"What voice was that which lately addressed you?\"    He paused for an answer; but observing my trepidation, he resumed, with  undiminished solemnity: \"Be not terrified. Whoever he was, he hast done  you an important service. I need not ask you if it were the voice of  a companion. That sound was beyond the compass of human organs. The  knowledge that enabled him to tell you who was in the closet, was  obtained by incomprehensible means.    \"You knew that Carwin was there. Were you not apprized of his intents?  The same power could impart the one as well as the other. Yet, knowing  these, you persisted. Audacious girl! but, perhaps, you confided in his  guardianship. Your confidence was just. With succour like this at hand  you may safely defy me.    \"He is my eternal foe; the baffler of my best concerted schemes. Twice  have you been saved by his accursed interposition. But for him I should  long ere now have borne away the spoils of your honor.\"    He looked at me with greater stedfastness than before. I became every  moment more anxious for my safety. It was with difficulty I stammered  out an entreaty that he would instantly depart, or suffer me to do so.  He paid no regard to my request, but proceeded in a more impassioned  manner.    \"What is it you fear? Have I not told you, you are safe? Has not one  in whom you more reasonably place trust assured you of it? Even if I  execute my purpose, what injury is done? Your prejudices will call it  by that name, but it merits it not. I was impelled by a sentiment that  does you honor; a sentiment, that would sanctify my deed; but, whatever  it be, you are safe. Be this chimera still worshipped; I will do nothing  to pollute it.\" There he stopped.    The accents and gestures of this man left me drained of all courage.  Surely, on no other occasion should I have been thus pusillanimous. My  state I regarded as a hopeless one. I was wholly at the mercy of this  being. Whichever way I turned my eyes, I saw no avenue by which I might  escape. The resources of my personal strength, my ingenuity, and my  eloquence, I estimated at nothing. The dignity of virtue, and the force  of truth, I had been accustomed to celebrate; and had frequently vaunted  of the conquests which I should make with their assistance.    I used to suppose that certain evils could never befall a being in  possession of a sound mind; that true virtue supplies us with energy  which vice can never resist; that it was always in our power to  obstruct, by his own death, the designs of an enemy who aimed at less  than our life. How was it that a sentiment like despair had now invaded  me, and that I trusted to the protection of chance, or to the pity of my  persecutor?    His words imparted some notion of the injury which he had meditated. He  talked of obstacles that had risen in his way. He had relinquished his  design. These sources supplied me with slender consolation. There was no  security but in his absence. When I looked at myself, when I reflected  on the hour and the place, I was overpowered by horror and dejection.    He was silent, museful, and inattentive to my situation, yet made no  motion to depart. I was silent in my turn. What could I say? I was  confident that reason in this contest would be impotent. I must owe my  safety to his own suggestions. Whatever purpose brought him hither, he  had changed it. Why then did he remain? His resolutions might fluctuate,  and the pause of a few minutes restore to him his first resolutions.    Yet was not this the man whom we had treated with unwearied kindness?  Whose society was endeared to us by his intellectual elevation and  accomplishments? Who had a thousand times expatiated on the usefulness  and beauty of virtue? Why should such a one be dreaded? If I could have  forgotten the circumstances in which our interview had taken place, I  might have treated his words as jests. Presently, he resumed:    \"Fear me not: the space that severs us is small, and all visible succour  is distant. You believe yourself completely in my power; that you stand  upon the brink of ruin. Such are your groundless fears. I cannot lift  a finger to hurt you. Easier it would be to stop the moon in "]]]
