Each slave received a  similar one on being freed.)    As a child Harriett played about the premises of the Bellinger estate,  leading a very carefree life as did all the slave children belonging to  Edmond Bellinger. When she was about twelve years old she was given  small tasks to do such as knitting a pair of stockings or dusting the  furniture and ample time was given for each of these assignments.    This was a very large plantation and there was always something for the  score of slaves to do. There were the wide acres of cotton that must be  planted, hoed and gathered by hand. A special batch of slave women did  the spinning and weaving, while those who had been taught to sew, made  most of the clothing worn by slaves at that time.    Other products grown here were rice, corn, sugarcane, fruits and  vegetables. Much of the food grown on the plantation was reserved to  feed the slaves. While they must work hard to complete their tasks in a  given time, no one was allowed to go hungry or forced to work if the  least ill.    Very little had to be bought here. Candles ware made in the kitchen of  the \"big house,\" usually by the cook who was helped by other slaves.  These were made of beeswax gathered on the plantation. Shoes were made  of tanned dried leather and re-inforced with brass caps; the large herds  of cattle, hogs and poultry furnished sufficient meat. Syrup and sugar  were made from the cane that was carried to a neighboring mill.    Harriett remembers her master as being exceptionally kind but very  severe when his patience was tried too far. Mrs. Bellinger was dearly  loved by all her slaves because she was very thoughtful of them.  Whenever there was a wedding, frolic or holiday or quilting bee, she  was sure to provide some extra \"goody\" and so dear to the hearts of the  women were the cast off clothes she so often bestowed upon them on these  occasions.    The slaves were free to invite those from the neighboring plantations to  join in their social gatherings. A Negro preacher delivered sermons on  the plantation. Services being held in the church used by whites after  their services on Sunday. The preacher must always act as a peacemaker  and mouthpiece for the master, so they were told to be subservient to  their masters in order to enter the Kingdom of God. But the slaves held  secret meetings and had praying grounds where they met a few at a time  to pray for better things.    Harriett remembers little about the selling of slaves because this was  never done on the Bellinger plantation. All slaves were considered a  part of the estate and to sell one, meant that it was no longer intact.    There were rumors of the war but the slaves on the Bellinger place did  not grasp the import of the war until their master went to fight on the  side of the Rebel army. Many of them gathered about their mistress and  wept as he left the home to which he would never return. Soon after that  it was whispered among the slaves that they would be free, but no one  ran away.    After living in plenty all their lives, they were forced to do without  coffee, sugar salt and beef. Everything available was bundled off to  the army by Mrs. Bellinger who shared the popular belief that the  soldiers must have the best in the way of food and clothing.    Harriett still remembers very clearly the storming of Fort Sumpter. The  whole countryside was thrown into confusion and many slaves were mad  with fear. There were few men left to establish order and many women  loaded their slaves into wagons and gathered such belongings as they  could and fled. Mrs. Bellinger was one of those who held their ground.    When the Union soldiers visited her plantation they found the plantation  in perfect order. The slaves going about their tasks as if nothing  unusual had happened. It was necessary to summon them from the fields to  give them the message of their freedom.    Harriett recalls that her mistress was very frightened but walked  upright and held a trembling lip between her teeth as they waited for  her to sound for the last time the horn that had summoned several  generations of human chattel to and from work.    Some left the plantation; others remained to harvest the crops. One and  all they remembered to thank God for their freedom. They immediately  began to hold meetings, singing soul stirring spirituals. Harriett  recalls one of these songs. It is as follows:      T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye,    T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye,    T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye    Da Heben gwinter be my home.    No slav'ry chains to tie me down,    And no mo' driver's ho'n to blow fer me    No mo' stocks to fasten me down    Jesus break slav'ry chain, Lord    Break slav'ry chain Lord,    Break slav'ry chain Lord,    Da Heben gwinter be my home.    Harriett's parents remained with the widowed woman for a while. Had they  not remained, she might not have met Gaylord Jeannette, the knight in  Blue, who later became her husband. He was a member of Company \"I\", 35th  Regiment. She is still a bit breathless when she relates the details of  the military wedding that followed a whirlwind courtship which had its  beginning on the citadel green, where the soldiers stationed there held  their dress parade. After these parades there was dancing by the  soldiers and belles who had bedecked themselves in their Sunday best and  come out to be wooed by a soldier in blue.    Music was furnished by the military band which offered many patriotic  numbers that awakened in the newly freed Negroes that had long been  dead--patriotism. Harriett recalls snatches of one of these songs to  which she danced when she was 20 years of age. It is as follows:      Don't you see the lightning flashing in the cane brakes,    Looks like we gonna have a storm    Although you're mistaken its the Yankee soldiers    Going to fight for Uncle Sam.    Old master was a colonel in the Rebel army    Just before he had to run away--    Look out the battle is a-falling    The darkies gonna occupy the land.    Harriett believes the two officers who tendered congratulations shortly  after her marriage to have been Generals Gates and Beecher. This was an  added thrill to her.    As she lived a rather secluded life, Harriett Gresham can tell very  little about the superstitions of her people during slavery, but knew  them to be very reverent of various signs and omens. In one she places  much credence herself. Prior to the Civil War, there were hordes of ants  and everyone said this was an omen of war, and there was a war.    She was married when schools were set up for Negroes, but had no time  for school. Her master was adamant on one point and that was the danger  of teaching a slave to read and write, so Harriett received little \"book  learning.\"    Harriett Gresham is the mother of several children, grandchildren and  great grandchildren. Many of them are dead. She lives at 1305 west 31st  Street, Jacksonville, Florida with a grand daughter. Her second husband  is also dead. She sits on the porch of her shabby cottage and sews the  stitches that were taught her by her mistress, who is also dead. She  embroiders, crochets, knits and quilts without the aid of glasses. She  likes to show her handiwork to passersby who will find themselves  listening to some of her reminiscences if they linger long enough to  engage her in conversation--for she loves to talk of the past.    She still corresponds with one of the children of her mistress, now an  old woman living on what is left of a once vast estate at Barnwell,  South Carolina. The two old women are very much attached to each other  and each in her letters helps to keep alive the memories of the life  they shared together as mistress and slave.      REFERENCE    1.

The Halls  who were the slaves of Thomas Lenton, owner of seventy-five or a hundred  slaves, were the parents of twenty-one children. The Halls, who were  born before slavery worked on the large plantation of Lenton which was  devoted primarily to the growing of cotton and corn and secondarily to  the growing of tobacco and pumpkins. Lenton was very good to his slaves  and never whipped them unless it was absolutely necessary--which was  seldom! He provided them with plenty of food and clothing, and always  saw to it that their cabins were liveable. He was careful, however, to  see that they received no educational training, but did not interfere  with their religious quest. The slaves were permitted to attend church  with their masters to hear the white preacher, and occasionally the  master--supposedly un-beknown to the slaves--would have an itinerant  colored minister preach to the slaves, instructing them to obey their  master and mistress at all times. Although freedom came to the slaves in  January, Master Lenton kept them until May in order to help him with his  crops. When actual freedom was granted to the slaves, only a few of the  young ones left the Lenton plantation. In 1882 Bolden Hall came to Live  Oak where he has resided ever since. He married but his wife is now  dead, and to that union one child was born.

The impression prevails  that southern hickory is more porous and brash than hickory from  the north. The tests ... indicate that southern hickory is as  tough and strong as northern hickory of the same age. But the  southern hickories have a greater tendency to be shaky, and this  results in much waste. In trees from southern river bottoms the  loss through shakes and grub-holes in many cases amounts to as  much as 50 per cent.    \"It is clear, therefore, that the difference in northern and  southern hickory is not due to geographic location, but rather  to the character of timber that is being cut. Nearly all of that  from southern river bottoms and from the Cumberland Mountains is  from large, old-growth trees; that from the north is from  younger trees which are grown under more favorable conditions,  and it is due simply to the greater age of the southern trees  that hickory from that region is lighter and more brash than  that from the north.\" Bul. 80, pp. 52-55.        SEASON OF CUTTING      It is generally believed that winter-felled timber has decided  advantages over that cut at other seasons of the year, and to  that cause alone are frequently ascribed much greater  durability, less liability to check and split, better color, and  even increased strength and toughness. The conclusion from the  various experiments made on the subject is that while the time  of felling may, and often does, affect the properties of wood,  such result is due to the weather conditions rather than to the  condition of the wood.    There are two phases of this question. One is concerned with the  physiological changes which might take place during the year in  the wood of a living tree. The other deals with the purely  physical results due to the weather, as differences in  temperature, humidity, moisture, and other features to be  mentioned later.    Those who adhere to the first view maintain that wood cut in  summer is quite different in composition from that cut in  winter. One opinion is that in summer the \"sap is up,\" while in  winter it is \"down,\" consequently winter-felled timber is drier.  A variation of this belief is that in summer the sap contains  certain chemicals which affect the properties of wood and does  not contain them in winter. Again it is sometimes asserted that  wood is actually denser in winter than in summer, as part of the  wood substance is dissolved out in the spring and used for plant  food, being restored in the fall.    It is obvious that such views could apply only to sapwood, since  it alone is in living condition at the time of cutting.  Heartwood is dead wood and has almost no function in the  existence of the tree other than the purely mechanical one of  support. Heartwood does undergo changes, but they are gradual  and almost entirely independent of the seasons.    Sapwood might reasonably be expected to respond to seasonal  changes, and to some extent it does. Just beneath the bark there  is a thin layer of cells which during the growing season have  not attained their greatest density. With the exception of this  one annual ring, or portion of one, the density of the wood  substance of the sapwood is nearly the same the year round.  Slight variations may occur due to impregnation with sugar and  starch in the winter and its dissolution in the growing season.  The time of cutting can have no material effect on the inherent  strength and other mechanical properties of wood except in the  outermost annual ring of growth.    The popular belief that sap is up in the spring and summer and  is down in the winter has not been substantiated by experiment.  There are seasonal differences in the composition of sap, but so  far as the amount of sap in a tree is concerned there is fully  as much, if not more, during the winter than in summer.  Winter-cut wood is not drier, to begin with, than  summer-felled--in reality, it is likely to be wetter.[47]    [Footnote 47: See Record, S.J.: Sap in relation to the  properties of wood. Proc. Am. Wood Preservers' Assn., Baltimore,  Md., 1913, pp. 160-166.    Kempfer, Wm. H.: The air-seasoning of timber. In Bul. 161, Am.  Ry. Eng. Assn., 1913, p. 214.]    The important consideration in regard to this question is the  series of circumstances attending the handling of the timber  after it is felled. Wood dries more rapidly in summer than in  winter, not because there is less moisture at one time than  another, but because of the higher temperature in summer. This  greater heat is often accompanied by low humidity, and  conditions are favorable for the rapid removal of moisture from  the exposed portions of wood. Wood dries by evaporation, and  other things being equal, this will proceed much faster in hot  weather than in cold.    It is a matter of common observation that when wood dries it  shrinks, and if shrinkage is not uniform in all directions the  material pulls apart, causing season checks. (See Fig. 27.) If  evaporation proceeds more rapidly on the outside than inside,  the greater shrinkage of the outer portions is bound to result  in many checks, the number and size increasing with the degree  of inequality of drying.    In cold weather, drying proceeds slowly but uniformly, thus  allowing the wood elements to adjust themselves with the least  amount of rupturing. In summer, drying proceeds rapidly and  irregularly, so that material seasoned at that time is more  likely to split and check.    There is less danger of sap rot when trees are felled in winter  because the fungus does not grow in the very cold weather, and  the lumber has a chance to season to below the danger point  before the fungus gets a chance to attack it. If the logs in  each case could be cut into lumber immediately after felling and  given exactly the same treatment, for example, kiln-dried, no  difference due to the season of cutting would be noted.        WATER CONTENT[48]      [Footnote 48:  See Tiemann, H.D.: Effect of moisture upon the  strength and stiffness of wood. Bul. 70, U.S. Forest Service,  Washington, D.C., 1906; also Cir. 108, 1907.]    Water occurs in living wood in three conditions, namely: (1) in  the cell walls, (2) in the protoplasmic contents of the cells,  and (3) as free water in the cell cavities and spaces. In  heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that  is thoroughly air-dried retains from 8 to 16 per cent of water  in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other  forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of  moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be  considered absolutely dry.    The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance  is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of  common observation is in the softening action of water on  rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits the greater the  water content the greater its softening effect.    Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood,  particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case  of a completely dry spruce block two inches in section, which  will sustain a permanent load four times as great as that which  a green block of the same size will support.    The greatest increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing  strength, and strength at elastic limit in endwise compression;  these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at  elastic limit in cross-bending, while the modulus of elasticity  is least affected. These ratios are shown in Table XV, but it is  to be noted that they apply only to wood in a much drier  condition than is used in practice. For air-dry wood the ratios  are considerably lower, particularly in the case of the ultimate  strength and the elastic limit. Stiffness (within the elastic  limit), while following a similar law, is less affected. In the  case of shear parallel to the grain, the general effect of  drying is to increase the strength, but this is often offset by  small splits and checks caused by shrinkage.    |----------------------------------------------------------------------|  |                               TABLE XV                               |  |----------------------------------------------------------------------|  |   EFFECT OF DRYING ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WOOD, SHOWN IN    |  |       RATIO OF INCREASE DUE TO REDUCING MOISTURE CONTENT FROM        |  |            THE GREEN CONDITION TO KILN-DRY (3.5 PER CENT)            |  |                   (Forest Service Bul. 70, p. 89)                    |  |----------------------------------------------------------------------|  |      KIND OF STRENGTH      |  Longleaf   |   Spruce    |  Chestnut   |  |                            |    pine     |             |             |  |----------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------|  |                            |  (1)    (2) |  (1)    (2) |  (1)   (2)  |  |                            |             |             |             |  | Crushing strength parallel |             |             |             |  |   to grain                 | 2.89   2.60 | 3.71   3.41 | 2.83   2.55 |  | Elastic limit in           |             |             |             |  |   compression              |             |             |             |  |   parallel to grain        | 2.60   2.34 | 3.80   3.49 | 2.40   2.26 |  | Modulus of rupture in      |             |             |             |  |   bending                  | 2.50   2.20 | 2.81   2.50 | 2.09   1.82 |  | Stress at elastic limit in |             |             |             |  |   bending                  | 2.90   2.55 | 2.90   2.58 | 2.30   2.00 |  | Crushing strength at right |             |             |             |  |   angles to grain          |             | 2.58   2.48 |             |  | Shearing strength parallel |      "]]]
