Hymn 2:54.  God's presence is light in darkness.    1 My God, the spring of all my joys,  The life of my delights,  The glory of my brightest days,  And comfort of my nights.    2 In darkest shades if he appear,  My dawning is begun;  He is my soul's sweet morning star  And he my rising sun.    3 The opening heavens around me shine  With beams of sacred bliss,  While Jesus shews his heart is mine,  And whispers, \"I am his!\"    4 My soul would leave this heavy clay  At that transporting word,  Run up with joy the shining way  T' embrace my dearest Lord.    5 Fearless of hell and ghastly death!  I'd break thro' every foe;  The wings of love, and arms of faith  Should bear me conqueror thro'.      Hymn 2:55.  Frail life and succeeding eternity.    1 Thee we adore, eternal Name,  And humbly own to thee,  How feeble is our mortal frame!  What dying worms are we!    2 [Our wasting lives grow shorter still  As months and days increase;  And every beating pulse we tell  Leaves but the number less.    3 The year rolls round, and steals away  The breath that first it gave;  Whate'er we do, where'er we be,  We're travelling to the grave.    4 Dangers stand thick thro' all the ground  To push us to the tomb,  And fierce diseases wait around  To hurry mortals home.    5 Good God! on what a slender thread  Hang everlasting things!  Th' eternal states of all the dead  Upon life's feeble strings.    6 Infinite joy or endless woe  Attends on every breath;  And yet how unconcern'd we go  Upon the brink of death!    7 Waken, O Lord, our drowsy sense  To walk this dangerous road;  And if our souls are hurried hence,  May they be found with God!      Hymn 2:56.  The misery of being without God in this world; or,  Vain prosperity.    1 O, I shall envy them no more  Who grow profanely great,  Tho' they increase their golden store,  And rise to wondrous height.    2 They taste of all the joys that grow  Upon this earthly clod,  Well they may search the creature thro',  For they have ne'er a God.    3 Shake off the thoughts of dying too,  And think your life your own;  But death comes hastening on to you  To mow your glory down.    4 Yes, you must bow your stately head,  Away your spirit flies,  And no kind angel near your bed  To bear it to the skies.    5 Go now, and boast of all your stores,  And tell how bright you shine;  Your heaps of glittering dust are yours,  And my Redeemer's mine.      Hymn 2:57.  The pleasures of a good conscience.    1 Lord, how secure and bless'd are they  Who feel the joys of pardon'd sin!  Should storms of wrath shake earth and sea,  Their minds have heaven and peace within.    2 The day glides sweetly o'er their heads,  Made up of innocence and love;  And soft and silent as the shades  Their nightly minutes gently move.    3 [Quick as their thoughts their joys come on,  But fly not half so fast away;  Their souls are ever bright as noon,  And calm as summer evenings be.    4 How oft they look to th' heavenly hills,  Where groves of living pleasure grow!  And longing hopes and cheerful smiles  Sit undisturb'd upon their brow.]    5 They scorn to seek our golden toys,  But spend the day and share the night  In numbering o'er the richer joys  That heaven prepares for their delight.    6 While wretched we, like worms and moles,  Lie grovelling in the dust below:  Almighty grace, renew our souls,  And we'll aspire to glory too.      Hymn 2:58  The shortness of life, and the goodness of God.    1 Time! what an empty vapour 'tis!  And days how swift they are!  Swift as an Indian arrow flies,  Or like a shooting star.    2 [The present moments just appear,  Then slide away in haste,  That we can never say, \"They're here,\"  But only say, \"They're past.\"]    3 [Our life is ever on the wing,  And death is ever nigh;  The moment when our lives begin  We all begin to die.]    4 Yet, mighty God, our fleeting days  Thy lasting favours share,  Yet with the bounties of thy grace  Thou load'st the rolling year.    5 'Tis sovereign mercy finds us food,  And we are cloth d with love;  While grace stands pointing out the road  That leads our souls above.    6 His goodness runs an endless round;  All glory to the Lord:  His mercy never knows a bound,  And be his Name ador'd!    7 Thus we begin the lasting song,  And when we close our eyes,  Let the next age thy praise prolong  Till time and nature dies.      Hymn 2:59.  Paradise on earth.    1 Glory to God that walks the sky,  And sends his blessings thro',  That tells his saints of joys on high,  And gives a taste below.    2 [Glory to God that stoops his throne  That dust and worms may see't,  And brings a glimpse of glory down  Around his sacred feet.    3 When Christ, with all his graces crown'd,  Sheds his kind beams abroad,  'Tis a young heaven on earthly ground,  And glory in the bud.    4 A blooming paradise of joy  In this wild desert springs;  And every sense I straight employ  On sweet celestial things.    5 White lilies all around appear,  And each his glory shows;  The rose of Sharon blossoms here,  The fairest flower that blows.    6 Cheerful I feast on heavenly fruit,  And drink the pleasures down,  Pleasures that flow hard by the foot  Of the eternal throne.]    7 But ah! how soon my joys decay,  How soon my sins arise,  And snatch the heavenly scene away  From these lamenting eyes!    8 When shall the time, dear Jesus, when  The shining day appear,  That I shall leave those clouds of sin,  And guilt and darkness here?    9 Up to the fields above the skies  My hasty feet would go,  There everlasting flowers arise,  And joys unwithering grow.      Hymn 2:60.  The truth of God the promiser; or,  The promises are our security.    1 Praise, everlasting praise be paid  To him that earth's foundations laid;  Praise to the God whose strong decrees  Sway the creation as he please.    2 Praise to the goodness of the Lord  Who rules his people by his word,  And there as strong as his decrees  He sets his kindest promises.    3 [Firm are the words his prophets give,  Sweet words on which his children live;  Each of them is the voice of God,  Who spoke and spread the skies abroad.    4 Each of them powerful as that sound  That bid the new-made heavens go round;  And stronger than the solid poles,  On which the wheel of nature rolls.]    5 Whence then should doubts and fears arise,  Why trickling sorrows drown our eyes?  Slowly, alas, our mind receives  The comforts that our Maker gives.    6 O for a strong, a lasting faith  To credit what th' almighty saith!  T' embrace the message of his Son,  And call the joys of heaven our own.    7 Then should the earth's old pillars shake,  And all the wheels of nature break,  Our steady souls should fear no more  Than solid rocks when billows roar.    8 Our everlasting hopes arise  Above the ruinable skies,  Where the eternal Builder reigns,  And his own courts his power sustains.        Hymn 2:61.  A thought of death and glory.    1 My soul, come meditate the day,  And think how near it stands,  When thou must quit this house of clay,  And fly to unknown lands.    2 [And you, mine eyes, look down and view  The hollow gaping tomb,  This gloomy prison waits for you  Whene'er the summons come.]    3 O could we die with those that die,  And place us in their stead,  Then would our spirits learn to fly,  And converse with the dead:    4 Then should we see the saints above  In their own glorious forms,  And wonder why our souls should love  To dwell with mortal worms.    5 [How we should scorn these clothes of flesh,  These fetters and this load!  And long for evening to undress,  That we may rest with God.]    6 We should almost forsake our clay  Before the summons come,  And pray, and wish our souls away  To their eternal home.      Hymn 2:62.  God the thunderer; or,  The last judgment and hell.*    1 Sing to the Lord, ye heavenly hosts,  And thou, O earth, adore,  Let death and hell thro' all their coasts,  Stand trembling at his power.    2 His sounding chariot shakes the sky,  He makes the clouds his throne,  There all his stores of lightning lie,  Till vengeance dart them down.    3 His nostrils breathe out fiery streams,  And from his awful tongue  A sovereign voice divides the flames,  And thunder roars along.    4 Think, O my soul, the dreadful day  When this incensed God  Shall rend the sky, and burn the sea,  And fling his wrath abroad.    5 What shall the wretch the sinner do?  He once defy'd the Lord;  But he shall dread the Thunderer now,  And sink beneath his word.    6 Tempests of angry fire shall roll  To blast the rebel-worm,  And beat upon his naked soul  In one eternal storm.    * Made in a great sudden storm  of thunder, August 20, 1697.      Hymn 2:63.  A funeral thought.    1 Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound,  My ears attend the cry,  \"Ye living men, come view the ground  \"Where you must shortly lie.    2 \"Princes, this clay must be your bed,  \"In spite of all your towers;  \"The tall, the wise, the reverend "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#19)"],[1,"sat in the Exchequer at Westminster, where he received the  accounts of the sheriffs. The Exchequer was composed of the  justiciar as head, the chancellor, the constable, two  chamberlains, the marshall and other experienced councilors. The  word \"Exchequer\" came from the chequered cloth on the table used  to calculate in Roman numerals the amount due and the amount paid.  The word \"calculate\" derives from the word \"calculi\", meaning  pebbles. It was a kind of abacus. The Exchequer received yearly  from the sheriffs of the counties taxes, fines, treasure trove,  goods from wrecks, deodands, and movable property of felons, of  persons executed, of fugitives, and of outlaws due to the Crown.  The Conqueror presided yearly over feasts involving several  thousand guests at Westminster Hall, which was 250 feet by 70 feet  with a high ceiling, the largest hall in England.    The Conquerer's reign was a time of tentative expedients and  simple solutions. He administered by issuing writs with commands  or prohibitions. These were read aloud by the sheriffs in the  county courts and other locations. Administration was by the  personal servants of his royal household, such as the chancellor,  chamberlain, constable, marshals, steward, and butler. The  language of government changed to Latin. The chancellor was from  the clergy and supervised the writers and clerks, who were  literate, and appended the great seal before witnesses to  documents. He also headed the staff of the royal chapel. The  chamberlain was a financial officer who audited and accounted. The  constable was responsible for supplies for the knights of the  royal household. He also supervised the care of horses, hounds,  hawks, and huntsmen, houndsmen, and foresters. The marshals came  from less important families than the constable and they preserved  order in the king's hall and recorded expenditures of the  household officers on tallies. The steward was a great baron whose  duties were chiefly ceremonial, such as placing the dishes before  the king at banquets.    Sheriffs became powerful figures as the primary agents for  enforcing royal edicts. There was no longer supervision of them by  earls nor influence on them by bishops. They were customarily  prominent barons. They collected the royal taxes, executed royal  justice, and presided over and controlled the hundred and county  courts. They were responsible for remitting a certain sum  annually. If a sheriff received more than necessary, he retained  the difference as his lawful profit of office. If he received less  than necessary, he had to make up the difference from his own  pocket. Before rendering this account, he paid the royal  benefactions to religious houses, provided for the maintenance of  stock on crown lands, paid for the costs of provisions supplied to  the court, and paid for traveling expenses of the king and his  visitors. The payments were initially paid in kind: e.g. grain,  cattle, horses, hounds, and hawks. Sheriffs also took part in the  keeping of castles and often managed the estates of the King. Most  royal writs were addressed to the sheriff and county courts. They  also led the county militia in time of war or rebellion. At times,  a sheriff usurped royal rights, used royal estates for his own  purposes, encroached on private land and rights, extorted money,  and collected revenues only for his own pockets. Over the  centuries, there was much competition for the authority to select  the king, e.g. by the king, the county court, the barons, and the  Exchequer. There was also much pressure to limit his term to one  year. Also, the powers of the sheriffs slowly declined.    Royal income came from customary dues, profits of coinage and of  justice, and revenues from the King's own estates. For war, there  was no change in the custom that a man with five hides of land was  required to furnish one heavy armed horseman for forty days  service in a year. The fyrd was retained. A threat of a Viking  invasion caused the Conquerer to reinstate the danegeld tax at 6s.  per hide, which was three times its old rate. (The price of an ox  was still about 30d.) To impose this tax uniformly, he sent  commissioners to conduct surveys by sworn verdicts of appointed  groups of local men. A detailed survey of land holdings and the  productive worth of each was made in 1086. The English called it  the \"Doomsday Book\" because there was no appeal from it.    The survey revealed, for instance, that one estate had \"on the  home farm five plough teams: there are also 25 villeins and 6  cotters with 14 teams among them. There is a mill worth 2s. a year  and one fishery, a church and four acres of meadow, wood for 150  pigs and two stone quarries, each worth 2s. a year, and two nests  of hawks in the wood and 10 slaves.\" This estate was deemed to be  worth 480s. a year.    Laxton \"had 2 carucates of land [assessed] to the geld. [There is]  land for 6 ploughs. There Walter, a man of [the lord] Geoffrey  Alselin's has 1 plough and 22 villeins and 7 bordars [a bordar had  a cottage and a small amount land in return for supplying small  provisions to his lord] having 5 ploughs and 5 serfs and 1 female  serf and 40 acres of meadow. Wood [land] for pannage [foraging by  pigs] 1 league in length and half a league in breadth. In King  Edward's time it was worth 9 pounds; now [it is worth] 6 pounds.\"    Ilbert de Laci has now this land, where he has twelve ploughs in  the demesne; and forty-eight villani, and twelve bordars with  fifteen ploughs, and three churches and three priests, and three  mills of ten shillings. Wood pastures two miles long, and one  broad. The whole manor five miles long and two broad. Value in  King Edward's time sixteen pounds, the same now.    That manor of the town of Coventry which was individually held was  that of the Countess of Coventry, who was the wife of the earl of  Mercia. \"The Countess held in Coventry. There are 5 hides. The  arable land employs 20 ploughs. In the demesne lands there are 3  ploughs and 7 bondmen. There are 50 villeins and 12 bordars with  20 ploughs. The mill there pay[s] 3 shillings. The woodlands are 2  miles long and the same broad. In King Edward's time and  afterwards, it was worth 22 pounds [440 s.], now only 11 pounds by  weight. These lands of the Countess Godiva Nicholas holds to farm  of the King.\"    The survey shows a few manors and monasteries owned a salthouse  or saltpit in the local saltworks, from which they were entitled  to obtain salt.    In total there were about 110,000 villani [former coerls regarded  as customary, irremovable cultivator tenants]; 82,000 bordarii;  7,000 cotarii and cotseti [held land by service of labor or rent  paid in produce], and 25,000 servi [landless laborers]. There are  no more theows.    In the nation, there was a total of about 25,000 servi [landless  laborers], over 82,000 borderii, nearly 7,000 coatarii and cotseti  [held land or houses by service of labor or rent paid in produce],  and nearly 110,000 villani. This survey resulted in the first  national tax system of about 6s. per hide of land.    The survey also provided the Conquerer with a summary of customs  of areas. For instance, in Oxfordshire, \"Anyone breaking the  King's peace given under his hand and seal to the extent of  committing homicide shall be at the King's mercy in respect of his  life and members. That is if he be captured. And if he cannot be  captured, he shall be considered as an outlaw, and anyone who  kills him shall have all his possessions. The king shall take the  possessions of any stranger who has elected to live in Oxford and  who dies in possession of a house in that town, and without any  kinfolk. The king shall be entitled to the body and the  possessions of any man who kills another within his own court or  house excepting always the dower of his wife, if he has a wife who  has received dower.    The courts of the king and barons became schools of chivalry  wherein seven year old noble boys became as pages or valets, wore  a dagger and waited upon the ladies of the household. At age  fourteen, they were advanced to squires and admitted into more  familiar association with the knights and ladies of the court.  They perfected their skills in dancing, riding, fencing, hawking,  hunting, jousting, and engaged in team sports in which the goal  was to put the other side to rout. They learned the knightly art  of war. Enemy fighters were to be taken and held for ransom rather  than killed. Those engaging in rebellion were to be pardoned and  restored to some or all of their lands and titles. Lords' sons  could be mutually exchanged with an enemy's as security for peace.  After achieving knighthood, a man usually selected a wife from the  court at which he grew up. Parents tried to send their daughters  to a household superior in social status not only to learn  manners, but to make a good marriage. A girl who did not marry was  often sent to a nunnery; a dowry was necessary before her  acceptance.    The following incidents of land tenure began (but were not firmly  established until the reign of Henry II). Each tenant, whether  baron or subtenant, was to pay an \"aid\" in money for ransom if his  lord was captured in war, for the knighthood of his lord's eldest  son, and for the marriage of his lord's eldest daughter. The aid  was theoretically voluntary. Land could be held by an heir only if  he could fight. The eldest son began to succeed to the whole of  the lands in all military tenures. Younger sons of great houses  became bishops. An heir of a tenant had to pay a heavy \"relief\" on  succession to his estate. The relief replaced the heriot. If there  was a delay in proving heirship or paying relief, the lord would  hold the land and receive its income in the meantime, often a  year. If an heir was still a minor or female, he or she passed  into his lord's wardship, in which the lord had guardianship of  the heir and"]]]
