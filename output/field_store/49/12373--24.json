When Nanahboozhoo heard her sad story he  became very angry. He was indignant that such a commendable maiden, one who  had been so kind to her little brothers and sisters, should be bothered by  a big, selfish, lazy fellow who only wanted her because she was so  industrious and so clever at her work.    \"Nanahboozhoo had heard much about her kindly treatment of the children,  and of her skill in providing for their wants, so he lost no time in going  back with her to her wigwam. At first the younger children were much afraid  of him, as they, like all other Indian children, had heard such wonderful  tales about him. But he was in such a jolly good humor that day, and was so  delighted with everything he saw about Waubenoo's wigwam and with the  proofs of her industry that he soon made friends with all the children. How  to go to work to give Gray Wolf such a lesson that he would never trouble  them any more he hardly knew at first. However, he had not been there many  hours before he had to come to a decision, for one of the little children  came rushing into the wigwam with the terrible news that Gray Wolf,  carrying a big dog whip and looking very angry, was coming along the trail.  Nanahboozhoo only laughed when he heard this, and he very quickly decided  what to do. 'Sit down there,' he said to Waubenoo, 'in that dark side of  the wigwam, with a blanket over your head, and keep perfectly still until I  call you; and you, children, must keep quiet. Do not be frightened or say a  word, no matter what happens.'    \"Then Nanahboozhoo, who, as you know, could change himself into any form he  liked, suddenly transformed himself so as to look exactly like Waubenoo. So  perfect was his resemblance to her, even to his dress, that her brothers  and sisters could not have detected the disguise. Indeed, the young ones  could not help looking over to the spot where the real Waubenoo sat in the  gloom with the blanket drawn over her head. But they were Indian children,  early trained to be quiet and do as they were told, and so they fully  obeyed his commands.    \"Of course, when Gray Wolf came into the wigwam he was completely  deceived, and now, thinking that he had caught Waubenoo when there were no  friendly Indians around, he at once began speaking very fiercely to her:    \"'I have asked you for the last time,' he said, 'and now I have come with  my dog whip and I intend giving you a good thrashing and then driving you  to my wigwam. I intend to call you Atim, my dog, and like a dog I am going  to thrash you.'    [Illustration: \"Gave him such a terrible beating.\"]    \"He then savagely raised the whip to strike, as he thought Waubenoo, but  the blow never reached its victim, or even Nanahboozhoo in his disguise, at  whom it was aimed, for Nanahboozhoo was so enraged that anybody in the  shape of a man could be so cruel and selfish as to come and threaten a kind  young woman like Waubenoo that he suddenly sprang at Gray Wolf, and seizing  him by his scalp lock he dragged him out of the wigwam, and then wrenching  the heavy whip out of his hand gave him such a terrible beating that he  remembered it as long as he lived. Then roughly throwing him to the ground,  Nanahboozhoo, still in the disguise of Waubenoo, hurried into the wigwam  and said to the real Waubenoo:    \"'Now, while he is weak and cowed, go out and talk sternly to him, and tell  him that if he ever troubles you again it will be worse for him than this  has been.'    \"When Waubenoo came out her appearance so terrified Gray Wolf that he tried  to get up and skulk away, weak as he was. Waubenoo, glad that her enemy  was so conquered that he would not be likely to trouble her much more, did  as Nanahboozhoo requested her.    \"Nanahboozhoo was heartily thanked by Waubenoo and the children for thus  ridding them of this bad Indian, who had for so long made their lives  miserable. Ere he left Nanahboozhoo warned the children to say nothing  about his coming, 'for,' said he, 'if Gray Wolf finds out who it was that  thrashed him he may yet be troublesome.'    \"Well would it have been for all if the children had remembered this  advice,\" added Souwanas.    \"O tell us what they did, and what happened,\" shouted Sagastao.    \"Not to-day,\" said the old man; \"it is time you both were back at your  lessons, and as I am going that way with some whitefish I will take you  with me in my canoe.\"    \"But is that all about the story of Waubenoo and the children?\" said  Minnehaha.    \"Yes,\" said Souwanas, \"until we come to the next. For a long time after  Gray Wolf received the beating he kept away from them, although his heart  was full of anger and revenge. Although he was a big fellow he feared to  again threaten her who, although she seemed but an ordinary-sized Indian  maiden, possessed the strength that had enabled her to give him such a  thrashing.\"          CHAPTER XIV.      The Pathetic Love Story of Waubenoo--The Treachery  of Gray Wolf--The Legend of the Whisky Jack.    \"It came about in this way,\" said Souwanas, \"and it is such a sad story  about beautiful Waubenoo.\"    \"Will it make me cry?\" said the tender-hearted Minnehaha. \"If so, I do not  think I want to hear it.\"    \"Stay and hear it, you little pussy,\" said Sagastao. \"I am sure it is not  worse than the Babes in the Wood.\"    \"Well, you always cry first, when we read that story together,\" said  Minnehaha.    At this the lad had nothing to say, for in spite of his apparent  brusqueness his heart melted more quickly, and his eyes filled easier with  tears, at a pathetic story, than did his sister's.    \"Well, go ahead, Souwanas,\" said Sagastao. \"We each have a pocket  handkerchief, and when they are used up you can lend us a blanket.\"    At this quaint speech everybody laughed, and then the old man began his  second story about Waubenoo. \"It all came about because little children  have long tongues, and this story should warn little children that, while  they have two eyes and two ears, they have but one tongue, and that they  should not at any time talk about or repeat half of what they have seen and  heard.    \"The little brothers and sisters of Waubenoo had been warned that they  should say nothing about the visit of Nanahboozhoo to their wigwam. In  fact, Nanahboozhoo was such a queer fellow that he did not at any time want  people to be gossiping about him, and, if he had done any good deed for  anyone, he did not wish them to be ever speaking about it. Then another  reason why Nanahboozhoo did not want them to talk about his visit and help  was the fear that Gray Wolf, finding out how it was that he had received  such a beating, would be more bitter and revengeful against Waubenoo and  would again try to get her in his power. The little children were, of  course, delighted that their wigwam was no longer visited by Gray Wolf,  whose coming had always filled them with terror, while Waubenoo was so  pleased at having thus got rid of him that she was happier and brighter  than she had been for a long time. It was not long before some of the other  Indians noticed the change. They were surprised that Gray Wolf had so  suddenly stopped his visits, and that he seemed so dejected and sullen.  Naturally their curiosity was excited, and they were anxious to find out  what had happened.\"    \"Better to have been minding their own business,\" broke in young Sagastao,  who seemed to see the drift of the story.    \"Be quiet, and do not interrupt Souwanas,\" said Minnehaha, who often felt  called upon to restrain her brother's impulsiveness.    \"Of course,\" Souwanas continued, \"Gray Wolf had so suffered that he had  very little to say, and if ever teased about Waubenoo he fell into a great  passion.    \"Waubenoo herself was too sensible to gratify their idle curiosity, but the  very return of her brightness, and her unwillingness to talk about the  matter, only added to the foolish desires of outsiders to find out what had  really occurred. So some of these naughty busybodies began questioning the  children when they could get them away from Waubenoo, for in her presence  they were as mute as she was. They pestered and bothered the children and  tried in various ways before they succeeded. But one day, while Waubenoo  was away overhauling her traps, some of those wicked meddlers visited her  wigwam and succeeded in getting one of the smallest ones--I just forget now  whether it was a boy or a girl.\"    \"A girl, of course,\" shouted Sagastao.    \"No, indeed; I am sure it was a naughty boy,\" said Minnehaha.    \"Well, no matter which; but one of them said: 'Nanahboozhoo!'    \"This one word, Nanahboozhoo, was quite enough to startle and alarm them,  for Nanahboozhoo was also much feared, as he sometimes did dreadful things.    \"The fact that Nanahboozhoo had been in their very midst, although they  were a long time in hearing anything more than the one word from the now  frightened children, was quite enough to excite the whole village, for the  news was soon spread abroad by the tattlers.    \"Such busybodies could not be satisfied with only hearing that Nanahboozhoo  had visited the wigwam of Waubenoo. Of course they wanted to hear about  what he said and did, and I am sorry to have to say that after a while,  with coaxing and presents, they managed to get from the children the whole  delightfully exciting story.    \"When Gray Wolf, who was so jeered and laughed at by all who dare, heard  from the gossipers how it had happened that he had received such a  thrashing he was doubly wild and furious.    \"When Waubenoo found out that all was known about how Nanahboozhoo had  helped her she was very sorry that her little brothers and sisters had been  so naughty and disobedient. She also knew that now she would have to be  more careful than ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10956"],[0,"Indian speeches (1907-1909) (#19)"],[1," it was going to a division, but Mr.  Gladstone begged his friends not to divide, because, he said, it was  very important that we should present a substantial unity to India.  This is upon the question of either House considering a Bill like the  Bill that is now on the Table--a mere skeleton of a Bill if you like.  I see it has been called vague and sketchy. It cannot be anything  else, on the broad principle set out by Mr. Gladstone--        \"It is the intention of the Government [that is, the Conservative      Government] that a serious effort shall be made to consider      carefully those elements which India in its present condition may      furnish, for the introduction into the Councils of India of the      elective principle. If that effort is seriously to be made, by      whom is it to be made? I do not think it can be made by this      House, except through the medium of empowering provisions. The      best course we could take would be to commend to the authorities      of India what is a clear indication of the principles on which we      desire them to proceed. It is not our business to devise machinery      for the purpose of Indian Government. It is our business to give      to those who represent Her Majesty in India ample information as      to what we believe to be sound principles of Government: and it      is, of course, the function of this House to comment upon any case      in which we may think they have failed to give due effect to those      principles.\"    I only allude to Mr. Gladstone's words, in order to let the House know  that I am taking no unusual course in leaving the bulk of the work,  the details of the work, to the Government of India. Discussion,  therefore, in Parliament will necessarily not, and cannot, turn  substantially upon details. But no doubt it is desirable that the main  heads of the regulations, rules, and proclamations to be made by the  Government of India under sanction of the India Office, should be more  or less placed within the reach and knowledge of the House so far as  they are complete. The principles of the Bill are in the Bill, and  will be affirmed, if your Lordships are pleased to read it a second  time. The Committee points, important as they are, can well be dealt  with in Committee. The view of Mr. Gladstone was cheerfully accepted  by the House of Commons then, and I hope it will be accepted by your  Lordships to-day.    There is one very important chapter in these regulations, which I  think now on the Second Reading of the Bill, without waiting for  Committee, I ought to say a few words to your Lordships about--I mean  the Mahomedans. That is a part of the Bill and scheme that has no  doubt attracted a great deal of criticism, and excited a great deal of  feeling in that important community. We suggested to the Government of  India a certain plan. We did not prescribe it, we did not order it,  but we suggested and recommended this plan for their consideration--no  more than that. It was the plan of a mixed or composite electoral  college, in which Mahomedans and Hindus should pool their votes, so to  say. The wording of the recommendation in my despatch was, as I soon  discovered, ambiguous--a grievous defect, of which I make bold to hope  I am not very often in public business guilty. But, to the best of  my belief, under any construction the plan of Hindus and Mahomedans  voting together, in a mixed and composite electorate, would have  secured to the Mahomedan electors, wherever they were so minded, the  chance of returning their own representatives in their due proportion.  The political idea at the bottom of this recommendation, which has  found so little favour, was that such composite action would bring  the two great communities more closely together, and this hope of  promoting harmony was held by men of high Indian authority and  experience who were among my advisers at the India Office. But the  Mahomedans protested that the Hindus would elect a pro-Hindu upon it,  just as I suppose in a mixed college of say seventy-five Catholics and  twenty-five Protestants voting together, the Protestants might suspect  that the Catholics voting for the Protestant would choose what is  called a Romanising Protestant, and as a little of a Protestant  as they could find. Suppose the other way. In Ireland there is an  expression, a \"shoneen\" Catholic--that is to say, a Catholic who,  though a Catholic, is too friendly with English Conservatism and other  influences which the Nationalists dislike. And it might be said, if  there were seventy-five Protestants against twenty-five Catholics,  that the Protestants when giving a vote in the way of Catholic  representation, would return \"shoneens.\" I am not going to take your  Lordships' time up by arguing this to-day. With regard to schemes  of proportional representation, as Calvin said of another study,  \"Excessive study of the Apocalypse either finds a man mad, or makes  him so.\" At any rate, the Government of India doubted whether our plan  would work, and we have abandoned it. I do not think it was a bad  plan, but it is no use, if you are making an earnest attempt in good  faith at a general pacification, to let parental fondness for a clause  interrupt that good process by sitting obstinately tight.    The Mahomedans demand three things. I had the pleasure of receiving  a deputation from them, and I know very well what is in their minds.  They demand the election of their own representatives to these  councils in all the stages, just as in Cyprus, where I think,  the Mahomedans vote by themselves. They have nine votes and the  non-Mahomedans have three, or the other way about. So in Bohemia,  where the Germans vote alone and have their own register. Therefore we  are not without a precedent and a parallel, for the idea of a separate  register. Secondly, they want a number of seats somewhat in excess of  their numerical strength. Those two demands we are quite ready and  intend to meet in full. There is a third demand that, if there is a  Hindu on the Viceroy's Executive Council--a subject on which I will  venture to say something to your Lordships before I sit down--there  should be two Indian members on the Viceroy's Council and one should  be a Mahomedan. Well, as I told them and as I now tell your Lordships,  I see no chance whatever of meeting their views in that way.    To go back to the point of the registers, some may be shocked at  the idea of a religious register at all, a register framed on the  principle of religious belief. We may wish--we do wish--that it  were otherwise. We hope that time, with careful and impartial  statesmanship, will make things otherwise. Only let us not forget  that the difference between Mahomedanism and Hinduism is not a mere  difference of articles of religious faith or dogma. It is a difference  in life, in tradition, in history, in all the social things as well as  articles of belief, that constitute a community. Do not let us forget  what makes it interesting and even exciting. Do not let us forget  that, in talking of Hindus and Mahomedans, we are dealing with, and  are brought face to face with, vast historic issues. We are dealing  with the very mightiest forces that through all the centuries and  ages have moulded the fortunes of great States and the destinies of  countless millions of mankind. Thoughts of that kind, my Lords,  are what give to Indian politics and to Indian work extraordinary  fascination, though at the same time they impose the weight of an  extraordinary burden.    I come to the question which, I think, has excited, certainly in this  country, more interest than anything else in the scheme before you--I  mean the question of an Indian member on the Viceroy's Executive  Council. The noble Marquess said here the other day that he hoped an  opportunity would be given for discussing it. \"Whether it is in order  or not--am too little versed in your Lordships' procedure to be quite  sure--but I am told that the rules of order in this House are of an  elastic description and that I shall not be trespassing beyond what is  right, if I introduce the point to-night.\" I thoroughly understand Lord  Lansdowne's anxiety for a chance of discussion. It is quite true,  and the House should not forget it, that this question is in no  way whatever touched by the Bill. If this Bill were rejected by  Parliament, it would be a grievous disaster to peace and contentment  in India, but it would not prevent the Secretary of State the very  next morning from advising His Majesty to appoint an Indian member of  the Viceroy's Executive Council.    The noble Marquess the other day fell into a slight error, if he will  forgive me for saying so. He said that the Government of India had  used cautious and tentative words, indicating that it would be  premature to decide at once this question of the Indian member until  after further experience had been gained. I think the noble Marquess  must have lost his way in the mazes of that enormous Blue-book which,  as he told us, caused him so much inconvenience, and added so much to  his excess luggage during the Christmas holidays. The despatch, as far  as I can discover, is silent altogether on the topic of the Indian  member of the Viceroy's Council, and deals only with the Councils  of Bombay and Madras and the proposed Councils for the  Lieutenant-Governorships.    Perhaps I might be allowed to remind your Lordships of the Act of  1833--certainly the most extensive and important measure of Indian  government between Mr. Pitt's famous Act of 1784, and Queen Victoria's  assumption of the government of India in 1858. There is nothing more  important than that Act. It lays down in the broadest way possible the  desire of Parliament that there should be no difference in appointing  to offices in India between one race and another, and the covering  despatch written by that memorable man, James Mill, wound up by"]]]
