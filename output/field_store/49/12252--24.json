The Indians pretend that when the araguatos fill the forests with  their howling, there is always one that chaunts as leader of the  chorus. The observation is pretty accurate. During a long interval one  solitary and strong voice is generally distinguished, till its place  is taken by another voice of a different pitch. We may observe from  time to time the same instinct of imitation among frogs, and almost  all animals which live together and exert their voices in union. The  Missionaries further assert, that, when a female among the araguatos  is on the point of bringing forth, the choir suspends its howlings  till the moment of the birth of the young. I could not myself judge of  the accuracy of this assertion; but I do not believe it to be entirely  unfounded. I have observed that, when an extraordinary incident, the  moans for instance of a wounded araguato, fixed the attention of the  band, the howlings were for some minutes suspended. Our guides assured  us gravely, that, to cure an asthma, it is sufficient to drink out of  the bony drum of the hyoidal bone of the araguato. This animal having  so extraordinary a volume of voice, it is supposed that its larynx  must necessarily impart to the water poured into it the virtue of  curing affections of the lungs. Such is the science of the vulgar,  which sometimes resembles that of the ancients.    We passed the night at the village of Guigue, the latitude of which I  found by observations of Canopus to be 10 degrees 4 minutes 11  seconds. The village, surrounded with the richest cultivation, is only  a thousand toises distant from the lake of Tacarigua. We lodged with  an old sergeant, a native of Murcia, a man of a very original  character. To prove to us that he had studied among the Jesuits, he  recited the history of the creation of the world in Latin. He knew the  names of Augustus, Tiberius, and Diocletian; and while enjoying the  agreeable coolness of the nights in an enclosure planted with bananas,  he employed himself in reading all that related to the courts of the  Roman emperors. He inquired of us with earnestness for a remedy for  the gout, from which he suffered severely. \"I know,\" said he, \"a Zambo  of Valencia, a famous curioso, who could cure me; but the Zambo would  expect to be treated with attentions which I cannot pay to a man of  his colour, and I prefer remaining as I am.\"    On leaving Guigue we began to ascend the chain of mountains, extending  on the south of the lake towards Guacimo and La Palma. From the top of  a table-land, at three hundred and twenty toises of elevation, we saw  for the last time the valleys of Aragua. The gneiss appeared  uncovered, presenting the same direction of strata, and the same dip  towards the north-west. Veins of quartz, that traverse the gneiss, are  auriferous; and hence the neighbouring ravine bears the name of  Quebrada del Oro. We heard with surprise at every step the name of  \"ravine of gold,\" in a country where only one single mine of copper is  wrought. We travelled five leagues to the village of Maria Magdalena,  and two leagues more to the Villa de Cura. It was Sunday, and at the  village of Maria Magdalena the inhabitants were assembled before the  church. They wanted to force our muleteers to stop and hear mass. We  resolved to remain; but, after a long altercation, the muleteers  pursued their way. I may observe, that this is the only dispute in  which we became engaged from such a cause. Very erroneous ideas are  formed in Europe of the intolerance, and even of the religious fervour  of the Spanish colonists.    San Luis de Cura, or, as it is commonly called, the Villa de Cura,  lies in a very barren valley, running north-west and south-east, and  elevated, according to my barometrical observations, two hundred and  sixty-six toises above the level of the ocean. The country, with the  exception of some fruit-trees, is almost destitute of vegetation. The  dryness of the plateau is the greater, because (and this circumstance  is rather extraordinary in a country of primitive rocks) several  rivers lose themselves in crevices in the ground. The Rio de Las  Minas, north of the Villa de Cura, is lost in a rock, again appears,  and then is ingulphed anew without reaching the lake of Valencia,  towards which it flows. Cura resembles a village more than a town. We  lodged with a family who had excited the resentment of government  during the revolution at Caracas in 1797. One of the sons, after  having languished in a dungeon, had been sent to the Havannah, to be  imprisoned in a strong fortress. With what joy his mother heard that  after our return from the Orinoco, we should visit the Havannah! She  entrusted me with five piastres, \"the whole fruit of her savings.\" I  earnestly wished to return them to her; but I feared to wound her  delicacy, and give pain to a mother, who felt a pleasure in the  privations she imposed on herself.    All the society of the town was assembled in the evening, to admire in  a magic lantern views of the great capitals of Europe. We were shown  the palace of the Tuileries, and the statue of the Elector at Berlin.    An apothecary who had been ruined by an unhappy propensity for working  mines, accompanied us in our excursion to the Serro de Chacao, very  rich in auriferous pyrites. We continued to descend the southern  declivity of the Cordillera of the coast, in which the plains of  Aragua form a longitudinal valley. We passed a part of the night of  the 11th of March at the village of San Juan, remarkable for its  thermal waters, and the singular form of two neighbouring mountains,  called the Morros of San Juan. They form slender peaks, which rise  from a wall of rocks with a very extensive base. The wall is  perpendicular, and resembles the Devil's Wall, which surrounds a part  of the group of mountains in the Hartz.* (* Die Teufels Mauer near  Wernigerode in Germany.) These peaks, when seen from afar in the  Llanos, strike the imagination of the inhabitants of the plain, who  are not accustomed to the least unequal ground, and the height of the  peaks is singularly exaggerated by them. They were described to us as  being in the middle of the steppes (which they in reality bound on the  north) far beyond a range of hills called La Galera. Judging from  angles taken at the distance of two miles, these hills are scarcely  more than a hundred and fifty-six toises higher than the village of  San Juan, and three hundred and fifty toises above the level of the  Llanos. The thermal waters glide out at the foot of these hills, which  are formed of transition-limestone. The waters are impregnated with  sulphuretted hydrogen, like those of Mariara, and form a little pool  or lagoon, in which the thermometer rose only to 31.3 degrees. I  found, on the night of the 9th of March, by very satisfactory  observations of the stars, the latitude of Villa de Cura to be 10  degrees 2 minutes 47 seconds.    The Villa de Cura is celebrated in the country for the miracles of an  image of the Virgin, known by the name of Nuestra Senora de los  Valencianos. This image was found in a ravine by an Indian, about the  middle of the eighteenth century, when it became the object of a  contest between the towns of Cura and San Sebastian de los Reyes. The  vicars of the latter town asserting that the Virgin had made her first  appearance on the territory of their parish, the Bishop of Caracas, in  order to put an end to the scandal of this long dispute, caused the  image to be placed in the archives of his bishopric, and kept it  thirty years under seal. It was not restored to the inhabitants of  Cura till 1802.    After having bathed in the cool and limpid water of the little river  of San Juan, the bottom of which is of basaltic grunstein, we  continued our journey at two in the morning, by Ortiz and Parapara, to  the Mesa de Paja. The road to the Llanos being at that time infested  with robbers, several travellers joined us so as to form a sort of  caravan. We proceeded down hill during six or seven hours; and we  skirted the Cerro de Flores, near which the road turns off, leading to  the great village of San Jose de Tisnao. We passed the farms of Luque  and Juncalito, to enter the valleys which, on account of the bad road,  and the blue colour of the slates, bear the names of Malpaso and  Piedras Azules.    This ground is the ancient shore of the great basin of the steppes,  and it furnishes an interesting subject of research to the geologist.  We there find trap-formations, probably more recent than the veins of  diabasis near the town of Caracas, which seem to belong to the rocks  of igneous formation. They are not long and narrow streams as in  Auvergne, but large sheets, streams that appear like real strata. The  lithoid masses here cover, if we may use the expression, the shore of  the ancient interior sea; everything subject to destruction, such as  the liquid dejections, and the scoriae filled with bubbles, has been  carried away. These phenomena are particularly worthy of attention on  account of the close affinities observed between the phonolites and  the amygdaloids, which, containing pyroxenes and  hornblende-grunsteins, form strata in a transition-slate. The better  to convey an idea of the whole situation and superposition of these  rocks, we will name the formations as they occur in a profile drawn  from north to south.    We find at first, in the Sierra de Mariara, which belongs to the  northern branch of the Cordillera of the coast, a coarse-grained  granite; then, in the valleys of Aragua, on the borders of the lake,  and in the islands, it contains, as in the southern branch of the  chain of the coast, gneiss and mica-slate. These last-named rocks are  auriferous in the Quebrada del Oro, near Guigue; and between Villa de  Cura and the Morros de San Juan, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy — Complete (#18)"],[1,"as immortal in  men's memories as the actual heroine of the White Rose, Flora Macdonald.  Her place is with Helen and Antigone, with Rosalind and Imogen, the  deathless daughters of dreams. She brightens the world as she passes, and  our own hearts tell us all the story when Osbaldistone says, \"You know  how I lamented her.\"    In the central interest, which, for once, is the interest of love, \"Rob  Roy\" attains the nobility, the reserve, the grave dignity of the highest  art. It is not easy to believe that Frank Osbaldistone is worthy of his  lady; but here no man is a fair judge. In the four novels--\"Waverley,\"  \"Guy Mannering,\" \"The Antiquary,\" and \"Rob Roy\"--which we have studied,  the hero has always been a young poet. Waverley versified; so did  Mannering; Lovel \"had attempted a few lyrical pieces;\" and, in  Osbaldistone's rhymes, Scott parodied his own                               blast of that dread horn                         On Fontarabian echoes borne.    All the heroes, then, have been poets, and Osbaldistone's youth may have  been suggested by Scott's memories of his own, and of the father who  \"feared that he would never be better than a gangrel scrapegut.\" Like  Henry Morton, in \"Old Mortality,\" Frank Osbaldistone is on the political  side taken by Scott's judgment, not by his emotions. To make Di Vernon  convert him to Jacobitism would have been to repeat the story of  Waverley. Still, he would have been more sympathetic if he had been  converted. He certainly does not lack spirit, as a sportsman, or \"on an  occasion,\" as Sir William Hope says in \"The Scots' Fencing Master,\" when  he encounters Rashleigh in the college gardens. Frank, in short, is all  that a hero should be, and is glorified by his affection.    Of the other characters, perhaps Rob Roy is too sympathetically drawn.  The materials for a judgment are afforded by Scott's own admirable  historical introduction. The Rob Roy who so calmly \"played booty,\" and  kept a foot in either camp, certainly falls below the heroic. His  language has been criticised in late years, and it has been insisted that  the Highlanders never talked Lowland Scotch. But Scott has anticipated  these cavils in the eighteenth chapter of the second volume. Certainly no  Lowlander knew the Highlanders better than he did, and his ear for  dialect was as keen as his musical ear was confessedly obtuse.  Scott had the best means of knowing whether Helen MacGregor would be  likely to soar into heroics as she is apt to do. In fact, here \"we may  trust the artist.\"    The novel is as rich as any in subordinate characters full of life and  humour. Morris is one of the few utter cowards in Scott. He has none of  the passionate impulses towards courage of the hapless hero in \"The Fair  Maid of Perth.\" The various Osbaldistones are nicely discriminated by  Diana Vernon, in one of those \"Beatrix moods\" which Scott did not always  admire, when they were displayed by \"Lady Anne\" and other girls of flesh  and blood. Rashleigh is of a nature unusual in Scott. He is, perhaps, Sir  Walter's nearest approach, for malignant egotism, to an Iago. Of Bailie  Nicol Jarvie commendation were impertinent. All Scotland arose, called  him hers, laughed at and applauded her civic child. Concerning Andrew  Fairservice, the first edition tells us what the final edition leaves us  to guess--that Tresham \"may recollect him as gardener at Osbaldistone  Hall.\" Andrew was not a friend who could be shaken off. Diana may have  ruled the hall, but Andrew must have remained absolute in the gardens,  with \"something to maw that he would like to see mawn, or something to  saw that he would like to see sawn, or something to ripe that he would  like to see ripen, and sae he e'en daikered on wi' the family frae year's  end to year's end,\" and life's end. His master \"needed some carefu' body  to look after him.\"    Only Shakspeare and Scott could have given us medicines to make us like  this cowardly, conceited \"jimp honest\" fellow, Andrew Fairservice, who  just escapes being a hypocrite by dint of some sincere old Covenanting  leaven in his veins. We make bold to say that the creator of Parolles and  Lucie, and many another lax and lovable knave, would, had he been a Scot,  have drawn Andrew Fairservice thus, and not otherwise.    The critics of the hour censured, as they were certain to censure, the  construction, and especially the conclusion, of \"Rob Roy.\" No doubt the  critics were right. In both Scott and Shakspeare there is often seen a  perfect disregard of the denouement. Any moderately intelligent person  can remark on the huddled-up ends and hasty marriages in many of  Shakspeare's comedies; Moliere has been charged with the same offence;  and, if blame there be, Scott is almost always to blame. Thackeray is  little better. There must be some reason that explains why men of genius  go wrong where every newspaper critic, every milliner's girl acquainted  with circulating libraries, can detect the offence.    In the closing remarks of \"Old Mortality\" Scott expresses himself  humorously on this matter of the denouement. His schoolmaster author  takes his proofsheets to Miss Martha Buskbody, who was the literary set  in Gandercleugh, having read through the whole stock of three circulating  libraries. Miss Buskbody criticises the Dominic as Lady Louisa Stuart  habitually criticised Sir Walter. \"Your plan of omitting a formal  conclusion will never do!\" The Dominie replies, \"Really, madam, you must  be aware that every volume of a narrative turns less and less interesting  as the author draws to a conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though  excellent hyson, is necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.\"  He compares the orthodox happy ending to \"the luscious lump of  half-dissolved sugar\" usually found at the bottom of the cup. This topic  might be discussed, and indeed has been discussed, endlessly. In our  actual lives it is probable that most of us have found ourselves living  for a year, or a month, or a week, in a chapter or half a volume of a  novel, and these have been our least happy experiences. But we have also  found that the romance vanishes away like a ghost, dwindles out, closes  with ragged ends, has no denouement. Then the question presents itself,  As art is imitation, should not novels, as a rule, close thus? The  experiment has frequently been tried, especially by the modern geniuses  who do not conceal their belief that their art is altogether finer than  Scott's, or, perhaps, than Shakspeare's.    In his practice, and in his Dominie's critical remarks, Sir Walter  appears inclined to agree with them. He was just as well aware as his  reviewers, or as Lady Louisa Stuart, that the conclusion of \"Rob Roy\" is  \"huddled up,\" that the sudden demise of all the young Baldistones is a  high-handed measure. He knew that, in real life, Frank and Di Vernon  would never have met again after that farewell on the moonlit road. But  he yielded to Miss Buskbody's demand for \"a glimpse of sunshine in the  last chapter;\" he understood the human liking for the final lump of  sugar. After all, fiction is not, any more than any other art, a mere  imitation of life: it is an arrangement, a selection. Scott was too kind,  too humane, to disappoint us, the crowd of human beings who find much of  our happiness in dreams. He could not keep up his own interest in his  characters after he had developed them; he could take pleasure in giving  them life,--he had little pleasure in ushering them into an earthly  paradise; so that part of his business he did carelessly, as his only  rivals in literature have also done it.    The critics censured, not unjustly, the \"machinery\" of the story,--these  mysterious \"assets\" of Osbaldistone and Tresham, whose absence was to  precipitate the Rising of 1715. The \"Edinburgh Review\" lost its heart  (Jeffrey's heart was always being lost) to Di Vernon. But it pronounces  that \"a king with legs of marble, or a youth with an ivory shoulder,\"  heroes of the \"Arabian Nights\" and of Pindar, was probable, compared with  the wit and accomplishments of Diana. This is hypercriticism. Diana's  education, under Rashleigh, had been elaborate; her acquaintance with  Shakspeare, her main strength, is unusual in women, but not beyond the  limits of belief. Here she is in agreeable contrast to Rose Bradwardine,  who had never heard of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" In any case, Diana compels  belief as well as wins affection, while we are fortunate enough to be in  her delightful company.    As long as we believe in her, it is not of moment to consider whether her  charms are incompatible with probability.    \"Rob Roy\" was finished in spite of \"a very bad touch of the cramp for  about three weeks in November, which, with its natural attendants of  dulness and, weakness, made me unable to get our matters forward till  last week,\" says Scott to Constable. \"But,\" adds the unconquerable  author, \"I am resting myself here a few days before commencing my new  labours, which will be untrodden ground, and, I think, pretty likely to  succeed.\" The \"new labours\" were \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian.\"    ANDREW LANG.
