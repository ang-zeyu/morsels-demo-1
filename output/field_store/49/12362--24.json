The works which Mr. Ramsay wrote upon this subject were, the essay just  mentioned, in 1784. _An Inquiry_, also, _into the Effects of the  Abolition of the Slave Trade_, in 1784; _A Reply to Personal Invectives  and Objections_, in 1785; _A Letter to James Tobin, Esq._, in 1787;  _Objections to the Abolition of the Slave Trade, with Answers_; and _An  Examination of Harris's Scriptural Researches on the Licitness of the  Slave Trade_, in 1788; and _An Address on the proposed Bill for the  Abolition of the Slave Trade_, in 1789. In short, from the time when he  first took up the cause, he was engaged in it till his death, which was  not a little accelerated by his exertions. He lived, however, to see  this cause in a train of parliamentary inquiry, and he died satisfied;  being convinced, as he often expressed, that the investigation must  inevitably lead to the total abolition of the Slave Trade.    In the next year, that is, in the year 1785, another advocate was seen  in Monsieur Necker, in his celebrated work on the _French Finances_,  which had just been translated into the English language from the  original work, in 1784. This virtuous statesman, after having given his  estimate of the population and revenue of the French West Indian  colonies, proceeds thus:--\"The colonies of France contain, as we have  seen, near five hundred thousand slaves, and it is from the number of  these poor wretches that the inhabitants set a value on their  plantations. What a dreadful prospect! and how profound a subject for  reflection! Alas! how little are we both in our morality and our  principles! We preach up humanity, and yet go every year to bind in  chains twenty thousand natives of Africa! We call the Moors barbarians  and ruffians, because they attack the liberty of Europeans at the risk  of their own; yet these Europeans go, without danger, and as mere  speculators, to purchase slaves by gratifying the avarice of their  masters, and excite all those bloody scenes which are the usual  preliminaries of this traffic!\" He goes on still further in the same  strain. He then shows the kind of power which has supported this  execrable trade. He throws out the idea of a general compact, by which  all the European nations should agree to abolish it; and he indulges the  pleasing hope that it may take place even in the present generation.    In the same year we find other coadjutors coming before our view, but  these in a line different from that in which any other belonging to this  class had yet moved. Mr. George White, a clergyman of the established  church, and Mr. John Chubb, suggested to Mr. William Tucket, the mayor  of Bridgewater, where they resided, and to others of that town, the  propriety of petitioning parliament for the abolition of the Slave  Trade. This petition was agreed upon, and, when drawn up, was as  follows:--    \"The humble petition of the inhabitants of Bridgewater showeth,    \"That your petitioners, reflecting with the deepest sensibility on the  deplorable condition of that part of the human species, the African  Negroes, who, by the most flagitious means, are reduced to slavery and  misery in the British colonies, beg leave to address this honourable  house in their behalf, and to express a just abhorrence of a system of  oppression, which no prospect of private gain, no consideration of  public advantage, no plea of political expediency, can sufficiently  justify or excuse.    \"That, satisfied as your petitioners are that this inhuman system meets  with the general execration of mankind, they flatter themselves the day  is not far distant when it will be universally abolished. And they most  ardently hope to see a British parliament, by the extinction of that  sanguinary traffic, extend the blessings of liberty to millions beyond  this realm, held up to an enlightened world a glorious and merciful  example, and stand in the defence of the violated rights of human  nature.\"    This petition was presented by the Honourable Ann Poulet, and Alexander  Hood, Esq., (afterwards Lord Bridport,) who were the members for the  town of Bridgewater. It was ordered to lie on the table. The answer  which these gentlemen gave to their constituents relative to the  reception of it in the House of Commons is worthy of notice:--\"There did  not appear,\" say they in their common letter, \"the least disposition to  pay any further attention to it. Every one almost says that the  abolition of the Slave Trade must immediately throw the West Indian  islands into convulsions, and soon complete their utter ruin. Thus they  will not trust Providence for its protection for so pious an  undertaking.\"    In the year 1786, Captain J.S. Smith, of the royal navy, offered himself  to the notice of the public in behalf of the African cause. Mr. Ramsay,  as I have observed before, had become involved in a controversy in  consequence of his support of it. His opponents not only attacked his  reputation, but had the effrontery to deny his facts. This circumstance  occasioned Captain Smith to come forward. He wrote a letter to his  friend Mr. Hill, in which he stated that he had seen those things, while  in the West Indies, which Mr. Ramsay had asserted to exist, but which  had been so boldly denied. He gave, also, permission to Mr. Hill to  publish this letter. Too much praise cannot be bestowed on Captain  Smith, for thus standing forth in a noble cause, and in behalf of an  injured character.    The last of the necessary forerunners and coadjutors of this class, whom  I am to mention, was our much-admired poet, Cowper; and a great  coadjutor he was, when we consider what value was put upon his  sentiments, and the extraordinary circulation of his works. There are  few persons who have not been properly impressed by the following  lines:--           My ear is pain'd,    My soul is sick with every day's report,    Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd.    There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,    It does not feel for man. The natural bond    Of brotherhood is sever'd as the flax    That falls asunder at the touch of fire.    He finds his fellow guilty of a skin    Not colour'd like his own, and having power    To inforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause    Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.    Lands intersected by a narrow frith    Abhor each other. Mountains interpos'd,    Make enemies of nations, who had else,    Like kindred drops been mingled into one.    Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;    And, worse than all, and most to be deplored    As human Nature's broadest, foulest blot,--    Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat    With stripes, that Mercy with a bleeding heart    Weeps, when she sees inflicted on a beast.    Then what is man? And what man, seeing this,    And having human feelings, does not blush    And hang his head to think himself a man?    I would not have a slave to till my ground,    To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,    And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth    That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd.    No: dear as freedom is,--and in my heart's    Just estimation prized above all price,--    I had much rather be myself the slave,    And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.    We have no slaves at home--then why abroad?    And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave    That parts us, are emancipate and loos'd.    Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs    Receive our air, that moment they are free;    They touch our country, and their shackles fall[A].    That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud    And jealous of the blessing. Spread it, then,    And let it circulate through every vein    Of all your empire--that where Britain's power    Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.      [Footnote A: Expressions used in the great trial, when Mr. Sharp  obtained the verdict in favour of Somerset.]          CHAPTER IV.    --Second class of forerunners and coadjutors, up to May 1787,  consists of the Quakers in England.--Of George Fox and others.--Of the  body of the Quakers assembled at the yearly meeting in 1727; and at  various other times.--Quakers, as a body, petition Parliament; and  circulate books on the subject.--Individuals among them become labourers  and associate in behalf of the Africans; Dilwyn, Harrison, and  others.--This the first association ever formed in England for the  purpose.      The second class of the forerunners and coadjutors in this great cause,  up to May 1787, will consist of the Quakers in England.    The first of this class was George Fox, the venerable founder of this  benevolent society.    George Fox was contemporary with Richard Baxter, being born not long  after him, and dying much about the same time. Like him, he left his  testimony against this wicked trade. When he was in the island of  Barbados, in the year 1671, he delivered himself to those who attended  his religious meetings in the following manner:--    \"Consider with yourselves,\" says he, \"if you were in the same condition  as the poor Africans are--who came strangers to you, and were sold to  you as slaves--I say, if this should be the condition of you or yours,  you would think it a hard measure; yea, and very great bondage and  cruelty. And, therefore, consider seriously of this; and do you for them  and to them, as you would willingly have them, or any others, do unto  you, were you in the like slavish condition, and bring them to know the  Lord Christ.\" And in his Journal, speaking of the advice which he gave  his friends at Barbados, he says, \"I desired also that they would cause  their overseers to deal mildly and gently with their negroes, and not to  use cruelty towards them, as the manner of some had been, and that after  certain years of servitude they should make them free.\"    William Edmundson, who was a minister of the society, and, indeed, a  fellow-traveller "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"lad. His kings laugh with all their hearts, like common people;  his mourners weep like such unaffected children of sorrow, that they must  needs \"swallow some of their tears.\"[45] His heroes, on the arrival of  intelligence that excites them, leap out of bed and write letters before  they dress, from natural impatience, thinking nothing of their \"dignity.\"  When Astolfo blows the magic horn which drives every body out of the  castle of Atlantes, \"not a mouse\" stays behind;--not, as Hoole and such  critics think, because the poet is here writing ludicrously, but because  he uses the same image seriously, to give an idea of desolation, as  Shakspeare in _Hamlet_ does to give that of silence, when \"not a mouse is  stirring.\" Instead of being mere comic writing, such incidents are in the  highest epic taste of the meeting of extremes,--of the impartial eye with  which Nature regards high and low. So, give Ariosto his hippogriff, and  other marvels with which he has enriched the stock of romance, and Nature  takes as much care of the verisimilitude of their actions, as if she had  made them herself. His hippogriff returns, like a common horse, to the  stable to which he has been accustomed. His enchanter, who is gifted with  the power of surviving decapitation and pursuing the decapitator so long  as a fated hair remains on his head, turns deadly pale in the face when  it is scalped, and falls lifeless from his horse. His truth, indeed, is  so genuine, and at the same time his style is so unaffected, sometimes so  familiar in its grace, and sets us so much at ease in his company, that  the familiarity is in danger of bringing him into contempt with the  inexperienced, and the truth of being considered old and obvious, because  the mode of its introduction makes it seem an old acquaintance. When  Voltaire was a young man, and (to Anglicise a favourite Gallic phrase)  fancied he had _profounded_ every thing deep and knowing, he thought  nothing of Ariosto. Some years afterwards he took him for the first of  grotesque writers, but nothing more. At last he pronounced him equally  \"entertaining and sublime, and humbly apologised for his error.\" Foscolo  quotes this passage from the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_; and adds  another from Sir Joshua Reynolds, in which the painter speaks of a  similar inability on his own part, when young, to enjoy the perfect  nature of Raphael, and the admiration and astonishment which, in his  riper years, he grew to feel for it.[46]    The excessive \"wildness\" attributed to Ariosto is not wilder than  many things in Homer, or even than some things in Virgil (such as the  transformation of ships into sea-nymphs). The reason why it has been  thought so is, that he rendered them more popular by mixing them with  satire, and thus brought them more universally into notice. One main  secret of the delight they give us is their being poetical comments,  as it were, on fancies and metaphors of our own. Thus, we say of  a suspicious man, that he is suspicion itself; Ariosto turns him  accordingly into an actual being of that name. We speak of the flights of  the poets; Ariosto makes them literally flights--flights on a hippogriff,  and to the moon. The moon, it has been said, makes lunatics; he  accordingly puts a man's wits into that planet. Vice deforms beauty;  therefore his beautiful enchantress turns out to be an old hag. Ancient  defeated empires are sounds and emptiness; therefore the Assyrian and  Persian monarchies become, in his limbo of vanities, a heap of positive  bladders. Youth is headstrong, and kissing goes by favour; so Angelica,  queen of Cathay, and beauty of the world, jilts warriors and kings, and  marries a common soldier.    And what a creature is this Angelica! what effect has she not had upon  the world in spite of all her faults, nay, probably by very reason of  them! I know not whether it has been remarked before, but it appears to  me, that the charm which every body has felt in the story of Angelica  consists mainly in that very fact of her being nothing but a beauty and  a woman, dashed even with coquetry, which renders her so inferior in  character to most heroines of romance. Her interest is founded on nothing  exclusive or prejudiced. It is not addressed to any special class. She  might or might not have been liked by this person or that; but the world  in general will adore her, because nature has made them to adore beauty  and the sex, apart from prejudices right or wrong. Youth will attribute  virtues to her, whether she has them or not; middle-age be unable to help  gazing on her; old-age dote on her. She is womankind itself, in form and  substance; and that is a stronger thing, for the most part, than all our  figments about it. Two musical names, \"Angelica and Medoro,\" have become  identified in the minds of poetical readers with the honeymoon of  youthful passion.    The only false acid insipid fiction I can call to mind in the _Orlando  Furioso_ is that of the \"swans\" who rescue \"medals\" from the river of  oblivion (canto xxxv.). It betrays a singular forgetfulness of the poet's  wonted verisimilitude; for what metaphor can reconcile us to swans taking  an interest in medals? Popular belief had made them singers; but it was  not a wise step to convert them into antiquaries.    Ariosto's animal spirits, and the brilliant hurry and abundance of his  incidents, blind a careless reader to his endless particular beauties,  which, though he may too often \"describe instead of paint\" (on account,  as Foscolo says, of his writing to the many), spew that no man could  paint better when he chose. The bosoms of his females \"come and go, like  the waves on the sea-coast in summer airs.\"[47] His witches draw the fish  out of the water      \"With simple words and a pure warbled spell.\"[48]    He borrows the word \"painting\" itself,--like a true Italian and friend  of Raphael and Titian, to express the commiseration in the faces of the  blest for the sufferings of mortality      \"Dipinte di pietade il viso pio.\"[49]      Their pious looks painted with tenderness.    Jesus is very finely called, in the same passage, \"il sempiterno Amante,\"  the eternal Lover. The female sex are the      \"Schiera gentil the pur adorna il mondo.\"[50]      The gentle bevy that adorns the world.    He paints cabinet-pictures like Spenser, in isolated stanzas, with a  pencil at once solid and light; as in the instance of the charming one  that tells the story of Mercury and his net; how he watched the Goddess  of Flowers as she issued forth at dawn with her lap full of roses and  violets, and so threw the net over her \"one day,\" and \"took her;\"      \"un di lo prese[51].\"    But he does not confine himself to these gentle pictures. He has many  as strong as Michael Angelo, some as intense as Dante. He paints the  conquest of America in five words      \"Veggio da diece cacciar mille.\"[52]    I see thousands    Hunted by tens.    He compares the noise of a tremendous battle heard in the neighbourhood  to the sound of the cataracts of the Nile:      \"un alto suon ch' a quel s' accorda    Con che i vicin' cadendo il Nil assorda.\"[53]    He \"scourges\" ships at sea with tempests--say rather the \"miserable  seamen;\" while night-time grows blacker and blacker on the \"exasperated  waters.\"[54]      When Rodomont has plunged into the thick of Paris, and is carrying every  thing before him (\"like a serpent that has newly cast his skin, and  goes shaking his three tongues under his eyes of fire\"), he makes this  tremendous hero break the middle of the palace-gate into a huge \"window,\"  and look through it with a countenance which is suddenly beheld by a  crowd of faces as pale as death:      \"E dentro fatto l' ha tanta finestra,    Che ben vedere e veduto esser puote    Dai visi impressi di color di morte[55].\"    The whole description of Orlando's jealousy and growing madness is  Shakspearian for passion and circumstance, as the reader may see even  in the prose abstract of it in this volume; and his sublimation of a  suspicious king into suspicion itself (which it also contains) is as  grandly and felicitously audacious as any thing ever invented by poet.  Spenser thought so; and has imitated and emulated it in one of his own  finest passages. Ariosto has not the spleen and gall of Dante, and  therefore his satire is not so tremendous; yet it is very exquisite, as  all the world have acknowledged in the instances of the lost things found  in the moon, and the angel who finds Discord in a convent. He does not  take things so much to heart as Chaucer. He has nothing so profoundly  pathetic as our great poet's _Griselda_. Yet many a gentle eye has  moistened at the conclusion of the story of Isabella; and to recur once  more to Orlando's jealousy, all who have experienced that passion will  feel it shake them. I have read somewhere of a visit paid to Voltaire by  an Italian gentleman, who recited it to him, and who (being moved perhaps  by the recollection of some passage in his own history) had the tears all  the while pouring down his cheeks.    Such is the poem which the gracious and good Cardinal Ippolito designated  as a \"parcel of trumpery.\" It had, indeed, to contend with more slights  than his. Like all originals, it was obliged to wait for the death of  the envious and the self-loving, before it acquired a popularity which  surpassed all precedent. Foscolo says, that Macchiavelli and Ariosto,  \"the two writers of that age who really possessed most excellence, were  the least praised during their lives. Bembo was approached in a posture  of adoration and fear; the infamous Aretino extorted a fulsome letter of  praises from the great and the learned[56].\" He might have added, that  the writer most in request \"in the circles\" was a gentleman of the name  of Bernardo Accolti, then called the _Unique_, now never heard of.  Ariosto himself eulogised him among a shoal of writers, half of whose"]]]
