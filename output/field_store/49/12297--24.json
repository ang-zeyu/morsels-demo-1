It was that the falcon was fitted with a sort of leash about both  talons, and from the leash hung a round bit of metal like a sleigh-bell.  The bird turned its fierce yellow eyes on me, and then stooped and struck  its curved beak into the quarry. At the same instant hurried steps  sounded among the heather, and a girl sprang into the covert in front.  Without a glance at me she walked up to the falcon, and passing her  gloved hand under its breast, raised it from the quarry. Then she deftly  slipped a small hood over the bird's head, and holding it out on her  gauntlet, stooped and picked up the hare.    She passed a cord about the animal's legs and fastened the end of the  thong to her girdle. Then she started to retrace her steps through the  covert As she passed me I raised my cap and she acknowledged my presence  with a scarcely perceptible inclination. I had been so astonished, so  lost in admiration of the scene before my eyes, that it had not occurred  to me that here was my salvation. But as she moved away I recollected  that unless I wanted to sleep on a windy moor that night I had better  recover my speech without delay. At my first word she hesitated, and as I  stepped before her I thought a look of fear came into her beautiful eyes.  But as I humbly explained my unpleasant plight, her face flushed and she  looked at me in wonder.    \"Surely you did not come from Kerselec!\" she repeated.    Her sweet voice had no trace of the Breton accent nor of any accent which  I knew, and yet there was something in it I seemed to have heard before,  something quaint and indefinable, like the theme of an old song.    I explained that I was an American, unacquainted with Finistere, shooting  there for my own amusement.    \"An American,\" she repeated in the same quaint musical tones. \"I have  never before seen an American.\"    For a moment she stood silent, then looking at me she said. \"If you  should walk all night you could not reach Kerselec now, even if you had a  guide.\"    This was pleasant news.    \"But,\" I began, \"if I could only find a peasant's hut where I might get  something to eat, and shelter.\"    The falcon on her wrist fluttered and shook its head. The girl smoothed  its glossy back and glanced at me.    \"Look around,\" she said gently. \"Can you see the end of these moors?  Look, north, south, east, west. Can you see anything but moorland and  bracken?\"    \"No,\" I said.    \"The moor is wild and desolate. It is easy to enter, but sometimes they  who enter never leave it. There are no peasants' huts here.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"if you will tell me in which direction Kerselec lies,  to-morrow it will take me no longer to go back than it has to come.\"    She looked at me again with an expression almost like pity.    \"Ah,\" she said, \"to come is easy and takes hours; to go is different--and  may take centuries.\"    I stared at her in amazement but decided that I had misunderstood her.  Then before I had time to speak she drew a whistle from her belt and  sounded it.    \"Sit down and rest,\" she said to me; \"you have come a long distance and  are tired.\"    She gathered up her pleated skirts and motioning me to follow picked her  dainty way through the gorse to a flat rock among the ferns.    \"They will be here directly,\" she said, and taking a seat at one end of  the rock invited me to sit down on the other edge. The after-glow was  beginning to fade in the sky and a single star twinkled faintly through  the rosy haze. A long wavering triangle of water-fowl drifted southward  over our heads, and from the swamps around plover were calling.    \"They are very beautiful--these moors,\" she said quietly.    \"Beautiful, but cruel to strangers,\" I answered.    \"Beautiful and cruel,\" she repeated dreamily, \"beautiful and cruel.\"    \"Like a woman,\" I said stupidly.    \"Oh,\" she cried with a little catch in her breath, and looked at me. Her  dark eyes met mine, and I thought she seemed angry or frightened.    \"Like a woman,\" she repeated under her breath, \"How cruel to say so!\"  Then after a pause, as though speaking aloud to herself, \"How cruel for  him to say that!\"    I don't know what sort of an apology I offered for my inane, though  harmless speech, but I know that she seemed so troubled about it that I  began to think I had said something very dreadful without knowing it, and  remembered with horror the pitfalls and snares which the French language  sets for foreigners. While I was trying to imagine what I might have  said, a sound of voices came across the moor, and the girl rose to her  feet.    \"No,\" she said, with a trace of a smile on her pale face, \"I will not  accept your apologies, monsieur, but I must prove you wrong, and that  shall be my revenge. Look. Here come Hastur and Raoul.\"    Two men loomed up in the twilight. One had a sack across his shoulders  and the other carried a hoop before him as a waiter carries a tray. The  hoop was fastened with straps to his shoulders, and around the edge of  the circlet sat three hooded falcons fitted with tinkling bells. The girl  stepped up to the falconer, and with a quick turn of her wrist  transferred her falcon to the hoop, where it quickly sidled off and  nestled among its mates, who shook their hooded heads and ruffled their  feathers till the belled jesses tinkled again. The other man stepped  forward and bowing respectfully took up the hare and dropped it into the  game-sack.    \"These are my piqueurs,\" said the girl, turning to me with a gentle  dignity. \"Raoul is a good fauconnier, and I shall some day make him grand  veneur. Hastur is incomparable.\"    The two silent men saluted me respectfully.    \"Did I not tell you, monsieur, that I should prove you wrong?\" she  continued. \"This, then, is my revenge, that you do me the courtesy of  accepting food and shelter at my own house.\"    Before I could answer she spoke to the falconers, who started instantly  across the heath, and with a gracious gesture to me she followed. I don't  know whether I made her understand how profoundly grateful I felt, but  she seemed pleased to listen, as we walked over the dewy heather.    \"Are you not very tired?\" she asked.    I had clean forgotten my fatigue in her presence, and I told her so.    \"Don't you think your gallantry is a little old-fashioned?\" she said; and  when I looked confused and humbled, she added quietly, \"Oh, I like it, I  like everything old-fashioned, and it is delightful to hear you say such  pretty things.\"    The moorland around us was very still now under its ghostly sheet of  mist. The plovers had ceased their calling; the crickets and all the  little creatures of the fields were silent as we passed, yet it seemed to  me as if I could hear them beginning again far behind us. Well in  advance, the two tall falconers strode across the heather, and the faint  jingling of the hawks' bells came to our ears in distant murmuring  chimes.    Suddenly a splendid hound dashed out of the mist in front, followed by  another and another until half-a-dozen or more were bounding and leaping  around the girl beside me. She caressed and quieted them with her gloved  hand, speaking to them in quaint terms which I remembered to have seen in  old French manuscripts.    Then the falcons on the circlet borne by the falconer ahead began to beat  their wings and scream, and from somewhere out of sight the notes of a  hunting-horn floated across the moor. The hounds sprang away before us  and vanished in the twilight, the falcons flapped and squealed upon their  perch, and the girl, taking up the song of the horn, began to hum. Clear  and mellow her voice sounded in the night air.      \"Chasseur, chasseur, chassez encore,    Quittez Rosette et Jeanneton,    Tonton, tonton, tontaine, tonton,    Ou, pour, rabattre, des l'aurore,    Que les Amours soient de planton,    Tonton, tontaine, tonton.\"    As I listened to her lovely voice a grey mass which rapidly grew more  distinct loomed up in front, and the horn rang out joyously through the  tumult of the hounds and falcons. A torch glimmered at a gate, a light  streamed through an opening door, and we stepped upon a wooden bridge  which trembled under our feet and rose creaking and straining behind us  as we passed over the moat and into a small stone court, walled on every  side. From an open doorway a man came and, bending in salutation,  presented a cup to the girl beside me. She took the cup and touched it  with her lips, then lowering it turned to me and said in a low voice, \"I  bid you welcome.\"    At that moment one of the falconers came with another cup, but before  handing it to me, presented it to the girl, who tasted it. The falconer  made a gesture to receive it, but she hesitated a moment, and then,  stepping forward, offered me the cup with her own hands. I felt this to  be an act of extraordinary graciousness, but hardly knew what was  expected of me, and did not raise it to my lips at once. The girl flushed  crimson. I saw that I must act quickly.    \"Mademoiselle,\" I faltered, \"a stranger whom you have saved from dangers  he may never realize empties this cup to the gentlest and loveliest  hostess of France.\"    \"In His name,\" she murmured, crossing herself as I drained the cup. Then  stepping into the doorway she turned to me with a pretty gesture and,  taking my hand in hers, led me into the house, saying again and again:  \"You are very welcome, indeed you are welcome to the Chateau d'Ys.\"          II    I awoke next morning with the music of the horn in my ears, and leaping  out of the ancient bed, went to a curtained window where the sunlight  filtered through little deep-set panes. The horn ceased as I looked into  the court below.    A man who might have been brother to the two falconers of the night  before stood in the midst of a pack of hounds. A curved horn was strapped  over his back, and in his hand he held a long-lashed whip. The dogs "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#18)"],[1,"shuddered.  Then Tarzan turned toward him.  His face was cold  and cruel, and in the grey eyes the Swede read murder.    \"Where is my wife?\" growled the ape-man.  \"Where is the child?\"    Anderssen tried to reply, but a sudden fit of coughing choked him.  There was an arrow entirely through his chest, and as he coughed the  blood from his wounded lung poured suddenly from his mouth and nostrils.    Tarzan stood waiting for the paroxysm to pass.  Like a bronze  image--cold, hard, and relentless--he stood over the helpless man,  waiting to wring such information from him as he needed, and then to  kill.    Presently the coughing and haemorrhage ceased, and again the wounded  man tried to speak.  Tarzan knelt near the faintly moving lips.    \"The wife and child!\" he repeated.  \"Where are they?\"    Anderssen pointed up the trail.    \"The Russian--he got them,\" he whispered.    \"How did you come here?\" continued Tarzan.  \"Why are you not with  Rokoff?\"    \"They catch us,\" replied Anderssen, in a voice so low that the ape-man  could just distinguish the words.   \"They catch us.  Ay fight, but my  men they all run away.   Then they get me when Ay ban vounded.  Rokoff  he say leave me here for the hyenas.  That vas vorse than to kill.   He  tak your vife and kid.\"    \"What were you doing with them--where were you taking them?\" asked  Tarzan, and then fiercely, leaping close to the fellow with fierce eyes  blazing with the passion of hate and vengeance that he had with  difficulty controlled, \"What harm did you do to my wife or child?  Speak quick before I kill you!  Make your peace with God!  Tell me the  worst, or I will tear you to pieces with my hands and teeth.  You have  seen that I can do it!\"    A look of wide-eyed surprise overspread Anderssen's face.    \"Why,\" he whispered, \"Ay did not hurt them.  Ay tried to save them from  that Russian.  Your vife was kind to me on the Kincaid, and Ay hear  that little baby cry sometimes.   Ay got a vife an' kid for my own by  Christiania an' Ay couldn't bear for to see them separated an' in  Rokoff's hands any more.   That vas all.  Do Ay look like Ay ban here  to hurt them?\" he continued after a pause, pointing to the arrow  protruding from his breast.    There was something in the man's tone and expression that convinced  Tarzan of the truth of his assertions.  More weighty than anything else  was the fact that Anderssen evidently seemed more hurt than frightened.  He knew he was going to die, so Tarzan's threats had little effect upon  him; but it was quite apparent that he wished the Englishman to know  the truth and not to wrong him by harbouring the belief that his words  and manner indicated that he had entertained.    The ape-man instantly dropped to his knees beside the Swede.    \"I am sorry,\" he said very simply.  \"I had looked for none but knaves  in company with Rokoff.  I see that I was wrong.   That is past now,  and we will drop it for the more important matter of getting you to a  place of comfort and looking after your wounds.  We must have you on  your feet again as soon as possible.\"    The Swede, smiling, shook his head.    \"You go on an' look for the vife an' kid,\" he said.   \"Ay ban as gude  as dead already; but\"--he hesitated--\"Ay hate to think of the hyenas.  Von't you finish up this job?\"    Tarzan shuddered.  A moment ago he had been upon the point of killing  this man.  Now he could no more have taken his life than he could have  taken the life of any of his best friends.    He lifted the Swede's head in his arms to change and ease his position.    Again came a fit of coughing and the terrible haemorrhage.   After it  was over Anderssen lay with closed eyes.    Tarzan thought that he was dead, until he suddenly raised his eyes to  those of the ape-man, sighed, and spoke--in a very low, weak whisper.    \"Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard!\" he said, and died.          Chapter 11    Tambudza      Tarzan scooped a shallow grave for the Kincaid's cook, beneath whose  repulsive exterior had beaten the heart of a chivalrous gentleman.  That was all he could do in the cruel jungle for the man who had given  his life in the service of his little son and his wife.    Then Tarzan took up again the pursuit of Rokoff.  Now that he was  positive that the woman ahead of him was indeed Jane, and that she had  again fallen into the hands of the Russian, it seemed that with all the  incredible speed of his fleet and agile muscles he moved at but a  snail's pace.    It was with difficulty that he kept the trail, for there were many  paths through the jungle at this point--crossing and crisscrossing,  forking and branching in all directions, and over them all had passed  natives innumerable, coming and going.   The spoor of the white men was  obliterated by that of the native carriers who had followed them, and  over all was the spoor of other natives and of wild beasts.    It was most perplexing; yet Tarzan kept on assiduously, checking his  sense of sight against his sense of smell, that he might more surely  keep to the right trail.  But, with all his care, night found him at a  point where he was positive that he was on the wrong trail entirely.    He knew that the pack would follow his spoor, and so he had been  careful to make it as distinct as possible, brushing often against the  vines and creepers that walled the jungle-path, and in other ways  leaving his scent-spoor plainly discernible.    As darkness settled a heavy rain set in, and there was nothing for the  baffled ape-man to do but wait in the partial shelter of a huge tree  until morning; but the coming of dawn brought no cessation of the  torrential downpour.    For a week the sun was obscured by heavy clouds, while violent rain and  wind storms obliterated the last remnants of the spoor Tarzan  constantly though vainly sought.    During all this time he saw no signs of natives, nor of his own pack,  the members of which he feared had lost his trail during the terrific  storm.  As the country was strange to him, he had been unable to judge  his course accurately, since he had had neither sun by day nor moon nor  stars by night to guide him.    When the sun at last broke through the clouds in the fore-noon of the  seventh day, it looked down upon an almost frantic ape-man.    For the first time in his life, Tarzan of the Apes had been lost in the  jungle.  That the experience should have befallen him at such a time  seemed cruel beyond expression.  Somewhere in this savage land his wife  and son lay in the clutches of the arch-fiend Rokoff.    What hideous trials might they not have undergone during those seven  awful days that nature had thwarted him in his endeavours to locate  them?  Tarzan knew the Russian, in whose power they were, so well that  he could not doubt but that the man, filled with rage that Jane had  once escaped him, and knowing that Tarzan might be close upon his  trail, would wreak without further loss of time whatever vengeance his  polluted mind might be able to conceive.    But now that the sun shone once more, the ape-man was still at a loss  as to what direction to take.  He knew that Rokoff had left the river  in pursuit of Anderssen, but whether he would continue inland or return  to the Ugambi was a question.    The ape-man had seen that the river at the point he had left it was  growing narrow and swift, so that he judged that it could not be  navigable even for canoes to any great distance farther toward its  source.  However, if Rokoff had not returned to the river, in what  direction had he proceeded?    From the direction of Anderssen's flight with Jane and the child Tarzan  was convinced that the man had purposed attempting the tremendous feat  of crossing the continent to Zanzibar; but whether Rokoff would dare so  dangerous a journey or not was a question.    Fear might drive him to the attempt now that he knew the manner of  horrible pack that was upon his trail, and that Tarzan of the Apes was  following him to wreak upon him the vengeance that he deserved.    At last the ape-man determined to continue toward the northeast in the  general direction of German East Africa until he came upon natives from  whom he might gain information as to Rokoff's whereabouts.    The second day following the cessation of the rain Tarzan came upon a  native village the inhabitants of which fled into the bush the instant  their eyes fell upon him.  Tarzan, not to be thwarted in any such  manner as this, pursued them, and after a brief chase caught up with a  young warrior.  The fellow was so badly frightened that he was unable  to defend himself, dropping his weapons and falling upon the ground,  wide-eyed and screaming as he gazed on his captor.    It was with considerable difficulty that the ape-man quieted the  fellow's fears sufficiently to obtain a coherent statement from him as  to the cause of his uncalled-for terror.    From him Tarzan learned, by dint of much coaxing, that a party of  whites had passed through the village several days before.  These men  had told them of a terrible white devil that pursued them, warning the  natives against it and the frightful pack of demons that accompanied it.    The black had recognized Tarzan as the white devil from the  descriptions given by the whites and their black servants.   Behind him  he had expected to see a horde of demons disguised as apes and panthers.    In this Tarzan saw the cunning hand of Rokoff.  The Russian was  attempting to make travel as difficult as possible for him by turning  the natives against him in superstitious fear.    The native further told Tarzan that the white man who had led the  recent expedition had promised them a fabulous reward if they would  kill the white devil.  This they had fully intended doing should the  opportunity present itself; but the moment they had seen Tarzan their  blood had turned to water, as the porters of the white men had told  them would be the case.
