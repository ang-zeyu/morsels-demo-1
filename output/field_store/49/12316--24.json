When this crisis had arrived, Miss Miggs, affecting to be exhausted  with terror, and to cling to the window-sill for support, put out her  nightcap, and demanded in a faint voice who was there.    Mr Tappertit cried 'Hush!' and, backing to the road, exhorted her in  frenzied pantomime to secrecy and silence.    'Tell me one thing,' said Miggs. 'Is it thieves?'    'No--no--no!' cried Mr Tappertit.    'Then,' said Miggs, more faintly than before, 'it's fire. Where is it,  sir? It's near this room, I know. I've a good conscience, sir, and would  much rather die than go down a ladder. All I wish is, respecting my love  to my married sister, Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, second  bell-handle on the right-hand door-post.'    'Miggs!' cried Mr Tappertit, 'don't you know me? Sim, you know--Sim--'    'Oh! what about him!' cried Miggs, clasping her hands. 'Is he in any  danger? Is he in the midst of flames and blazes! Oh gracious, gracious!'    'Why I'm here, an't I?' rejoined Mr Tappertit, knocking himself on the  breast. 'Don't you see me? What a fool you are, Miggs!'    'There!' cried Miggs, unmindful of this compliment. 'Why--so  it--Goodness, what is the meaning of--If you please, mim, here's--'    'No, no!' cried Mr Tappertit, standing on tiptoe, as if by that means  he, in the street, were any nearer being able to stop the mouth of Miggs  in the garret. 'Don't!--I've been out without leave, and something or  another's the matter with the lock. Come down, and undo the shop window,  that I may get in that way.'    'I dursn't do it, Simmun,' cried Miggs--for that was her pronunciation  of his Christian name. 'I dursn't do it, indeed. You know as well as  anybody, how particular I am. And to come down in the dead of night,  when the house is wrapped in slumbers and weiled in obscurity.' And  there she stopped and shivered, for her modesty caught cold at the very  thought.    'But Miggs,' cried Mr Tappertit, getting under the lamp, that she might  see his eyes. 'My darling Miggs--'    Miggs screamed slightly.    '--That I love so much, and never can help thinking of,' and it  is impossible to describe the use he made of his eyes when he said  this--'do--for my sake, do.'    'Oh Simmun,' cried Miggs, 'this is worse than all. I know if I come  down, you'll go, and--'    'And what, my precious?' said Mr Tappertit.    'And try,' said Miggs, hysterically, 'to kiss me, or some such  dreadfulness; I know you will!'    'I swear I won't,' said Mr Tappertit, with remarkable earnestness. 'Upon  my soul I won't. It's getting broad day, and the watchman's waking  up. Angelic Miggs! If you'll only come and let me in, I promise you  faithfully and truly I won't.'    Miss Miggs, whose gentle heart was touched, did not wait for the oath  (knowing how strong the temptation was, and fearing he might forswear  himself), but tripped lightly down the stairs, and with her own fair  hands drew back the rough fastenings of the workshop window. Having  helped the wayward 'prentice in, she faintly articulated the words  'Simmun is safe!' and yielding to her woman's nature, immediately became  insensible.    'I knew I should quench her,' said Sim, rather embarrassed by this  circumstance. 'Of course I was certain it would come to this, but there  was nothing else to be done--if I hadn't eyed her over, she wouldn't  have come down. Here. Keep up a minute, Miggs. What a slippery figure  she is! There's no holding her, comfortably. Do keep up a minute, Miggs,  will you?'    As Miggs, however, was deaf to all entreaties, Mr Tappertit leant her  against the wall as one might dispose of a walking-stick or umbrella,  until he had secured the window, when he took her in his arms again,  and, in short stages and with great difficulty--arising from her being  tall and his being short, and perhaps in some degree from that peculiar  physical conformation on which he had already remarked--carried her  upstairs, and planting her, in the same umbrella and walking-stick  fashion, just inside her own door, left her to her repose.    'He may be as cool as he likes,' said Miss Miggs, recovering as soon  as she was left alone; 'but I'm in his confidence and he can't help  himself, nor couldn't if he was twenty Simmunses!'        Chapter 10      It was on one of those mornings, common in early spring, when the year,  fickle and changeable in its youth like all other created things, is  undecided whether to step backward into winter or forward into summer,  and in its uncertainty inclines now to the one and now to the other, and  now to both at once--wooing summer in the sunshine, and lingering still  with winter in the shade--it was, in short, on one of those mornings,  when it is hot and cold, wet and dry, bright and lowering, sad and  cheerful, withering and genial, in the compass of one short hour, that  old John Willet, who was dropping asleep over the copper boiler, was  roused by the sound of a horse's feet, and glancing out at window,  beheld a traveller of goodly promise, checking his bridle at the Maypole  door.    He was none of your flippant young fellows, who would call for a tankard  of mulled ale, and make themselves as much at home as if they had  ordered a hogshead of wine; none of your audacious young swaggerers, who  would even penetrate into the bar--that solemn sanctuary--and, smiting  old John upon the back, inquire if there was never a pretty girl in the  house, and where he hid his little chambermaids, with a hundred other  impertinences of that nature; none of your free-and-easy companions, who  would scrape their boots upon the firedogs in the common room, and  be not at all particular on the subject of spittoons; none of your  unconscionable blades, requiring impossible chops, and taking unheard-of  pickles for granted. He was a staid, grave, placid gentleman, something  past the prime of life, yet upright in his carriage, for all that, and  slim as a greyhound. He was well-mounted upon a sturdy chestnut cob, and  had the graceful seat of an experienced horseman; while his riding gear,  though free from such fopperies as were then in vogue, was handsome and  well chosen. He wore a riding-coat of a somewhat brighter green than  might have been expected to suit the taste of a gentleman of his years,  with a short, black velvet cape, and laced pocket-holes and cuffs, all  of a jaunty fashion; his linen, too, was of the finest kind, worked in a  rich pattern at the wrists and throat, and scrupulously white. Although  he seemed, judging from the mud he had picked up on the way, to have  come from London, his horse was as smooth and cool as his own iron-grey  periwig and pigtail. Neither man nor beast had turned a single hair; and  saving for his soiled skirts and spatter-dashes, this gentleman, with  his blooming face, white teeth, exactly-ordered dress, and perfect  calmness, might have come from making an elaborate and leisurely toilet,  to sit for an equestrian portrait at old John Willet's gate.    It must not be supposed that John observed these several characteristics  by other than very slow degrees, or that he took in more than half a one  at a time, or that he even made up his mind upon that, without a great  deal of very serious consideration. Indeed, if he had been distracted in  the first instance by questionings and orders, it would have taken him  at the least a fortnight to have noted what is here set down; but it  happened that the gentleman, being struck with the old house, or with  the plump pigeons which were skimming and curtseying about it, or with  the tall maypole, on the top of which a weathercock, which had been out  of order for fifteen years, performed a perpetual walk to the music of  its own creaking, sat for some little time looking round in silence.  Hence John, standing with his hand upon the horse's bridle, and  his great eyes on the rider, and with nothing passing to divert his  thoughts, had really got some of these little circumstances into his  brain by the time he was called upon to speak.    'A quaint place this,' said the gentleman--and his voice was as rich as  his dress. 'Are you the landlord?'    'At your service, sir,' replied John Willet.    'You can give my horse good stabling, can you, and me an early dinner (I  am not particular what, so that it be cleanly served), and a decent  room of which there seems to be no lack in this great mansion,' said the  stranger, again running his eyes over the exterior.    'You can have, sir,' returned John with a readiness quite surprising,  'anything you please.'    'It's well I am easily satisfied,' returned the other with a smile,  'or that might prove a hardy pledge, my friend.' And saying so, he  dismounted, with the aid of the block before the door, in a twinkling.    'Halloa there! Hugh!' roared John. 'I ask your pardon, sir, for keeping  you standing in the porch; but my son has gone to town on business, and  the boy being, as I may say, of a kind of use to me, I'm rather put  out when he's away. Hugh!--a dreadful idle vagrant fellow, sir, half  a gipsy, as I think--always sleeping in the sun in summer, and in  the straw in winter time, sir--Hugh! Dear Lord, to keep a gentleman  a waiting here through him!--Hugh! I wish that chap was dead, I do  indeed.'

In this disorder the departures from the normal seem to be less  pronounced than in the psychoses considered above. The number of  individual reactions is in most cases not greatly above the normal  average; and, so far as their character is concerned, we find that  many of them are classed as normal, in accordance with the appendix to  the frequency tables; among the unclassified reactions, which are  quite frequent here, we find mostly either obviously normal ones, or  some of the type to which we have already referred as \"far-fetched,\"  while others among them are \"circumstantial\" (see p. 25); further we  find that most of the remaining individual reactions fall into the  general group of partial dissociation: non-specific reactions, sound  reactions, word complements, and particles.    In some cases the only abnormality that is found is that of an undue  tendency to respond by non-specific reactions, most of them being  common and there being no excessive number of individual reactions. It  would seem legitimate to assume that this tendency is here to be  regarded as a manifestation of the phenomenon which is clinically  described as _dearth of ideas_. It is significant that this  tendency is observed not only in depressive phases of the psychosis,  but also in manic phases and even in the normal intervals of recurrent  cases or after apparent recovery in acute cases; this will be seen  from some of the test records which are here reproduced.    Occasionally cases are met with which give a large number of  unclassified reactions, seemingly incoherent. There can be no doubt  that at least some of these cases are clinically perfectly typical  ones of manic-depressive insanity, yet the test records strongly  resemble, in some respects, those of dementia præcox.    Since clinically the distinction between typical cases of these  psychoses can be so clearly made on the basis of the disorders of the  flow of thought respectively characterizing them, it could hardly be  assumed that the associational disturbances in these two groups of  cases are truly related, although there may be an apparent  resemblance; it must be acknowledged that we are here confronted with  one of the most serious shortcomings of the association test, or at  least of the present method of applying it.
