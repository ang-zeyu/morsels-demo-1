At last he  was ordered away on active service; first to suppress what was known as  the \"Two-cent Rebellion\" in Lyons, and after that to the town of Douay  in Belgium.    If was while there that bad news came to him from Corsica. His family  was again in trouble. His mother had tried silkworm raising, and failed;  his uncle the canon was very sick; his good friend and the patron of the  family, General Marbeuf, was dead; his brothers were unsuccessful in  getting positions or employment; and something must be done to help  matters in the big bare house in Ajaccio.    Worried over the news, Napoleon tried to get leave of absence, so as to  go to Corsica and see what he could do. But this favor was not granted  him. His anxiety made him low-spirited; this brought on an attack of  fever. The leave of absence was granted him because he was sick; and  early in 1787 he went home to Corsica.    He had been absent from home for eight years. At once he tried to set  matters on a better footing. He fixed up the little house at Melilli,  which had belonged to his mother's father; tried to help his mother in  her attempts at mulberry-growing for the silkworms; saw that his brother  Joseph was enabled to go into the oil-trade; brightened up his uncle the  canon with his political discussions and a correspondence with a famous  French physician as to the cure for his uncle's gout; and finally, being  recalled to his regiment, went back to Paris, and joined his regiment at  Auxonne.    While in garrison at this place, he lodged with Professor Lombard, a  teacher of mathematics, whom he sometimes assisted in his classes. He  worked hard, kept out of debt, ate little, and was \"poor, but proud.\" He  gained the esteem of his superiors; for in a letter to Joey Fesch, who  was now a priest, he wrote:      \"The general here thinks very well of me; so much so, that he has    ordered me to construct a polygon,--works for which great calculations    are necessary,--and I am hard at work at the head of two hundred men.    This unheard-of mark of favor has somewhat irritated the captains    against me; they declare it is insulting to them that a lieutenant    should be intrusted with so important a work, and that, when more than    thirty men are employed, one of them should not have been sent out    also. My comrades also have shown some jealousy, but it will pass.    What troubles me is my health, which does not seem to me very good.\"    Indeed, it was not very good. He was just at the age when a young fellow  needs all the good food, healthful exercise, and restful sleep that are  possible; and these Napoleon did not permit himself. The doctor of his  regiment told him he must take better care of himself; but that he did  not, we know from this scrap from a letter to his mother:--    \"I have no resources but work. I dress but once in eight days, for the  Sunday parade. I sleep but little since my illness; it is incredible. I  go to bed at ten o'clock, and get up at four in the morning. I take but  one meal a day, at three o'clock. But that is good for my health.\"    The boy probably added that last line to keep his mother from feeling  anxious. But it was not true. Such a life for a growing boy is very  bad for his health. Again Napoleon fell ill, obtained six months' sick  leave, and went again to Corsica. This visit was a much longer one than  the first. In fact, he overstayed his leave; got into trouble with the  authorities because of this; smoothed it over; regained his health;  wrote and worked; mixed himself up in Corsican politics; became a fiery  young advocate of liberty; and at last, after a year's absence from  France, returned to join his regiment at Auxonne, taking with him his  young brother, Louis, whom he had agreed to support and educate.    It was quite a burden for this young man of twenty to assume. But  Napoleon undertook it cheerfully, he was glad to be able to do anything  that should lighten his mother's burdens.    The brothers did not have a particularly pleasant home at Auxonne. They  lived in a bare room in the regimental barracks, \"Number 16,\" up  one flight of stairs. It was wretchedly furnished. It contained an  uncurtained bed, a table, two chairs, and an old wooden box, which the  boys used, both as bureau and bookcase. Louis slept on a little cot-bed  near his brother; and how they lived on sixty cents a day--paying out of  that for food, lodging, clothes, and books--is one of the mysteries.    [Illustration: \"_'I dreamed that I was a king,' said Louis_\"]    In fact, they nearly starved themselves. Napoleon made the broth;  brushed and mended their clothes; sometimes had only dry bread for a  meal; and, as Napoleon said later, \"bolted the door on his poverty.\"  That is to say, they went nowhere, and saw no one.    It was hard on the young lieutenant; it was perhaps even harder on the  little brother.    One morning, after Napoleon had dressed himself and was preparing their  poor breakfast, he knocked on the floor with his cane to arouse his  brother and call him to breakfast and studies.    Little Louis awoke so slowly that Napoleon was obliged to arouse him a  second time.    \"Come, come, my Louis,\" he cried; \"what is the matter this morning? It  seems to me that you are very lazy.\"    \"Oh, brother!\" answered the half-awaked child, \"I was having such a  beautiful dream!\"    \"And what did you dream?\" asked Napoleon.    The little Louis sat upright on the edge of his cot. \"I dreamed that I  was a king,\" he replied.    \"A king! Well, well!\" exclaimed his brother, laughing. Then he glanced  around at the bare and poverty-stricken room. \"And what, then, your  Majesty, was I, your brother,--an emperor perhaps?\" Then he shrugged his  shoulders, and pinched his brother's ear.    \"Well, kings and emperors must eat and work,\" he said, \"the same as  lieutenants and schoolboys. Come, then, King Louis; some broth, and then  to your duty.\"    This was Napoleon at twenty,--a poverty-pinched, self-sacrificing,  hard-working boy, a man before his time; knowing very little of fun and  comfort, and very much of toil and trouble.    He was an ill-proportioned young man, not yet having outgrown the  \"spindling\" appearance of his boyhood, but even then he possessed  certain of the remarkable features familiar to every boy and girl who  has studied the portraits of Napoleon the emperor. His head was large  and finely shaped, with a wide forehead, large mouth, and straight nose,  a projecting chin, and large, steel-blue eyes, that were full of fire  and power. His face was sallow, his hair brown and stringy, his cheeks  lean from not too much over-feeding. His body and lees were thin and  small, but his chest was broad, and his neck short and thick. His step  was firm and steady, with nothing of the \"wobbly\" gait we often see in  people who are not well-proportioned. His character was undoubtedly that  of a young man who had the desire to get ahead faster than his  opportunities would permit. Solitude had made him uncommunicative and  secretive; anxiety and privation had made him self-helpful and  self-reliant; lack of sympathy had made him calculating; but doing for  others had made him kind-hearted and generous. His reading and study had  made him ambitious; his knowledge that when he knew a thing he really  knew it, made him masterful and desirous of leadership. He had few of  the vices, and sowed but a small crop of what is called the \"wild oats\"  of youth; he abhorred debt, and scarcely ever owed a penny, even when in  sorest straits; and, while not a bright nor a great scholar, what he had  learned he was able to store away in his brain, to be drawn upon for use  when, in later years, this knowledge could be used to advantage.    [Illustration: _Lieutenant Napoleon Bonaparte Aged 22 (from the  portrait by Jean Baptiste Greuse, in the Museum at  Versailles)_]    Such at twenty years of age was Napoleon Bonaparte. Such he remained  through the years of his young manhood, meeting all sorts of  discouragements, facing the hardest poverty, becoming disgusted with  many things that occurred in those changing days, when liberty was  replacing tyranny, and the lesson of free America was being read and  committed by the world.    He saw the turmoil and terrors of the French Revolution--that season of  blood, when a long-suffering people struck a blow at tyranny, murdered  their king, and tried to build on the ruins of an overturned kingdom an  impossible republic.    You will understand all this better when you come to read the history of  France, and see through how many noble but mistaken efforts that fair  European land struggled from tyranny to freedom. In these efforts  Napoleon had a share; and it was his boyhood of privation and his youth  of discouragement that made him a man of purpose, of persistence and  endeavor, raising him step by step, in the days when men needed leaders  but found none, until this one finally proved himself a leader indeed,  and, grasping the reins of command, advanced steadily from the barracks  to a throne. All this is history; it is the story of the development and  progress of the most remarkable man of modern times. You can read the  story in countless books; for now, after Napoleon has been dead for over  seventy years, the world is learning to sift the truth from all the  chaff of falsehood and fable that so long surrounded him; it is  endeavoring to place this marvellous leader of men in the place he  should rightly occupy--that of a great man, led by ambition and swayed  by selfishness, but moved also by a desire to do noble things for the  nation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#18)"],[1,"  \"Maybe they're going to drop down on us from above, and try to sink  us,\" suggested the youth, while he stood ready to fire again. \"If they  do--\"    His words were interrupted by a slight jar throughout the submarine.    \"What was that?\" cried the captain.    \"Dad fired the bow gun at them, but I don't believe he hit them,\"  answered the young inventor.    \"I wonder what damage I did? Guess we'll go to the surface to find out.\"    Clearly the Wonder had given up the fight for the time being. In fact,  she had no weapon with which to respond to a fusillade from her rival.  Tom hastened forward and informed his father of what had happened.    \"If her steering gear is out of order, we may have a chance to slip  away,\" said Mr. Swift \"We'll go up and see what we can learn.\"    A few minutes later Tom, his father and Captain Weston stepped from the  conning tower, which was out of water, on to the little flat deck a  short distance away lay the Wonder, and on her deck was Berg and a  number of men, evidently members of the crew.    \"Why did you fire on us?\" shouted the agent angrily.    \"Why did you follow us?\" retorted Tom.    \"Well, you've broken our rudder and disabled us,\" went on Berg, not  answering the question. \"You'll suffer for this!  I'll have you  arrested.\"    \"You only got what you deserved,\" added Mr. Swift. \"You were acting  illegally, following us, and you tried to sink us by ramming my craft  before we retaliated by firing on you.\"    \"It was an accident, ramming you,\" said Berg. \"We couldn't help it. I  now demand that you help us make repairs.\"    \"Well, you've got nerve!\" cried Captain Weston, his eyes flashing. \"I'd  like to have a personal interview with you for about ten minutes. Maybe  something besides your ship would need repairs then.\"    Berg turned away, scowling, but did not reply. He began directing the  crew what to do about the broken rudder.    \"Come on,\" proposed Tom in a low voice, for sounds carry very easily  over water. \"Let's go below and skip out while we have a chance. They  can't follow now, and we can get to the sunken treasure ahead of them.\"    \"Good advice,\" commented his father. \"Come, Captain Weston, we'll go  below and close the conning tower.\"    Five minutes later the Advance sank from sight, the last glimpse Tom  had of Berg and his men being a sight of them standing on the deck of  their floating boat, gazing in the direction of their successful rival.  The Wonder was left behind, while Tom and his friends were soon once  more speeding toward the treasure wreck.          Chapter Nineteen    Captured      \"Down deep,\" advised Captain Weston, as he stood beside Tom and Mr.  Swift in the pilot house. \"As far as you can manage her, and then  forward. We'll take no more chances with these fellows.\"    \"The only trouble is,\" replied the young inventor, \"that the deeper we  go the slower we have to travel. The water is so dense that it holds us  back.\"    \"Well, there is no special need of hurrying now,\" went on the sailor.  \"No one is following you, and two or three days difference in reaching  the wreck will not amount to anything.\"    \"Unless they repair their rudder, and take after us again,\" suggested  Mr. Swift.    \"They're not very likely to do that,\" was the captain's opinion. \"It  was more by luck than good management that they picked us up before.  Now, having to delay, as they will, to repair their steering gear,  while we can go as deep as we please and speed ahead, it is practically  impossible for them to catch up to us. No, I think we have nothing to  fear from them.\"    But though danger from Berg and his crowd was somewhat remote, perils  of another sort were hovering around the treasure-seekers, and they  were soon to experience them.    It was much different from sailing along in the airship, Tom thought,  for there was no blue sky and fleecy clouds to see, and they could not  look down and observe, far below them, cities and villages. Nor could  they breathe the bracing atmosphere of the upper regions.    But if there was lack of the rarefied air of the clouds, there was no  lack of fresh atmosphere. The big tanks carried a large supply, and  whenever more was needed the oxygen machine would supply it.    As there was no need, however, of remaining under water for any great  stretch of time, it was their practice to rise every day and renew the  air supply, also to float along on the surface for a while, or speed  along, with only the conning tower out, in order to afford a view, and  to enable Captain Weston to take observations. But care was always  exercised to make sure no ships were in sight when emerging on the  surface, for the gold-seekers did not want to be hailed and questioned  by inquisitive persons.    It was about four days after the disabling of the rival submarine, and  the Advance was speeding along about a mile and a half under water. Tom  was in the pilot house with Captain Weston, Mr. Damon was at his  favorite pastime of looking out of the glass side windows into the  ocean and its wonders, and Mr. Swift and the balloonist were, as  usual, in the engine-room.    \"How near do you calculate we are to the sunken wreck?\" asked Tom of  his companion.    \"Well, at the calculation we made yesterday, we are within about a  thousand miles of it now. We ought to reach it in about four more days,  if we don't have any accidents.\"    \"And how deep do you think it is?\" went on the lad.    \"Well, I'm afraid it's pretty close to two miles, if not more. It's  quite a depth, and of course impossible for ordinary divers to reach.  But it will be possible in this submarine and in the strong diving  suits your father has invented for us to get to it. Yes, I don't  anticipate much trouble in getting out the gold, once we reach the  wreck of course--\"    The captain's remark was not finished. From the engine-room there came  a startled shout:    \"Tom! Tom! Your father is hurt! Come here, quick!\"    \"Take the wheel!\" cried the lad to the captain. \"I must go to my  father.\" It was Mr. Sharp's voice he had heard.    Racing to the engine-room, Tom saw his parent doubled up over a dynamo,  while to one side, his hand on a copper switch, stood Mr. Sharp.    \"What's the matter?\" shouted the lad.    \"He's held there by a current of electricity,\" replied the balloonist.  \"The wires are crossed.\"    \"Why don't you shut off the current?\" demanded the youth, as he  prepared to pull his parent from the whirring machine.  Then he  hesitated, for he feared he, too, would be glued fast by the terrible  current, and so be unable to help Mr. Swift.    \"I'm held fast here, too,\" replied the balloonist. \"I started to cut  out the current at this switch, but there's a short circuit somewhere,  and I can't let go, either. Quick, shut off all power at the main  switchboard forward.\"    Tom realized that this was the only thing to do. He ran forward and  with a yank cut out all the electric wires. With a sigh of relief Mr.  Sharp pulled his hands from the copper where he had been held fast as  if by some powerful magnet, his muscles cramped by the current.  Fortunately the electricity was of low voltage, and he was not burned.  The body of Mr. Swift toppled backward from the dynamo, as Tom sprang  to reach his father.    \"He's dead!\" he cried, as he saw the pale face and the closed eyes.    \"No, only badly shocked, I hope,\" spoke Mr. Sharp. \"But we must get him  to the fresh air at once. Start the tank pumps.  We'll rise to the  surface.\"    The youth needed no second bidding. Once more turning on the electric  current, he set the powerful pumps in motion and the submarine began to  rise. Then, aided by Captain Weston and Mr. Damon, the young inventor  carried his father to a couch in the main cabin. Mr. Sharp took charge  of the machinery.    Restoratives were applied, and there was a flutter of the eyelids of  the aged inventor.    \"I think he'll come around all right,\" said the sailor kindly, as he  saw Tom's grief. \"Fresh air will be the thing for him. We'll be on the  surface in a minute.\"    Up shot the Advance, while Mr. Sharp stood ready to open the conning  tower as soon as it should be out of water. Mr. Swift seemed to be  rapidly reviving. With a bound the submarine, forced upward from the  great depth, fairly shot out of the water. There was a clanking sound  as the aeronaut opened the airtight door of the tower, and a breath of  fresh air came in.    \"Can you walk, dad, or shall we carry you?\" asked Tom solicitously.    \"Oh, I--I'm feeling better now,\" was the inventor's reply.  \"I'll soon  be all right when I get out on deck. My foot slipped as I was adjusting  a wire that had gotten out of order, and I fell so that I received a  large part of the current. I'm glad I was not burned. Was Mr. Sharp  hurt? I saw him run to the switch, just before I lost consciousness.\"    \"No, I'm all right,\" answered the balloonist. \"But allow us to get you  out to the fresh air. You'll feel much better then.\"    Mr. Swift managed to walk slowly to the ladder leading to the conning  tower, and thence to the deck. The others followed him. As all emerged  from the submarine they uttered a cry of astonishment.    There, not one hundred yards away, was a great warship, flying a flag  which, in a moment, Tom recognized as that of Brazil. The cruiser was  lying off a small island, and all about were small boats, filled with  natives, who seemed to be bringing supplies from land to the ship. At  the unexpected sight of the submarine, bobbing up from the bottom of  the ocean, the natives uttered cries of fright.  The attention of those  on the warship was attracted, and the bridge and rails were lined with  curious officers and men.    \"It's a good thing we didn't come up under that ship,\" observed Tom.  \"They would have thought we were trying to torpedo her. Do you feel  better, dad?\" he asked, his wonder over the sight of the big vessel  temporarily eclipsed in his anxiety for"]]]
