They seemed happy, frisky cattle, a  little impudent, and either determined to go back into the warm shed, or  determined not to go back, I could not decide which.    Presently the woman came forward again, her head rather ducked. But she  looked up at me and smiled, with that odd, immediate intimacy, something  witch-like and impossible.    'Sorry to keep you waiting,' she said. 'Shall we stand in this  cart-shed--it will be more out of the wind.'    So we stood among the shafts of the open cart-shed that faced the road.  Then she looked down at the ground, a little sideways, and I noticed a  small black frown on her brows. She seemed to brood for a moment. Then  she looked straight into my eyes, so that I blinked and wanted to turn my  face aside. She was searching me for something and her look was too near.  The frown was still on her keen, sallow brow.    'Can you speak French?' she asked me abruptly.    'More or less,' I replied.    'I was supposed to learn it at school,' she said. 'But I don't know a  word.' She ducked her head and laughed, with a slightly ugly grimace and  a rolling of her black eyes.    'No good keeping your mind full of scraps,' I answered.    But she had turned aside her sallow, long face, and did not hear what I  said. Suddenly again she looked at me. She was searching. And at the same  time she smiled at me, and her eyes looked softly, darkly, with infinite  trustful humility into mine. I was being cajoled.    'Would you mind reading a letter for me, in French,' she said, her face  immediately black and bitter-looking. She glanced at me, frowning.    'Not at all,' I said.    'It's a letter to my husband,' she said, still scrutinizing.    I looked at her, and didn't quite realize. She looked too far into me, my  wits were gone. She glanced round. Then she looked at me shrewdly. She  drew a letter from her pocket, and handed it to me. It was addressed from  France to Lance-Corporal Goyte, at Tible. I took out the letter and began  to read it, as mere words. '_Mon cher Alfred_'--it might have been a bit  of a torn newspaper. So I followed the script: the trite phrases of a  letter from a French-speaking girl to an English soldier. 'I think of you  always, always. Do you think sometimes of me?' And then I vaguely  realized that I was reading a man's private correspondence. And yet, how  could one consider these trivial, facile French phrases private! Nothing  more trite and vulgar in the world, than such a love-letter--no newspaper  more obvious.    Therefore I read with a callous heart the effusions of the Belgian  damsel. But then I gathered my attention. For the letter went on, '_Notre  cher petit bebe_--our dear little baby was born a week ago. Almost I  died, knowing you were far away, and perhaps forgetting the fruit of our  perfect love. But the child comforted me. He has the smiling eyes and  virile air of his English father. I pray to the Mother of Jesus to send  me the dear father of my child, that I may see him with my child in his  arms, and that we may be united in holy family love. Ah, my Alfred, can I  tell you how I miss you, how I weep for you. My thoughts are with you  always, I think of nothing but you, I live for nothing but you and our  dear baby. If you do not come back to me soon, I shall die, and our child  will die. But no, you cannot come back to me. But I can come to you, come  to England with our child. If you do not wish to present me to your good  mother and father, you can meet me in some town, some city, for I shall  be so frightened to be alone in England with my child, and no one to take  care of us. Yet I must come to you, I must bring my child, my little  Alfred to his father, the big, beautiful Alfred that I love so much. Oh,  write and tell me where I shall come. I have some money, I am not a  penniless creature. I have money for myself and my dear baby--'    I read to the end. It was signed: 'Your very happy and still more unhappy  Elise.' I suppose I must have been smiling.    'I can see it makes you laugh,' said Mrs. Goyte, sardonically. I looked  up at her.    'It's a love-letter, I know that,' she said. 'There's too many \"Alfreds\"  in it.'    'One too many,' I said.    'Oh, yes--And what does she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's  another thing.' She grimaced a little, looking up at me with a mocking  laugh.    'Where did you get this letter?' I said.    'Postman gave it me last week.'    'And is your husband at home?'    'I expect him home tonight. He's been wounded, you know, and we've been  applying for him home. He was home about six weeks ago--he's been in  Scotland since then. Oh, he was wounded in the leg. Yes, he's all right,  a great strapping fellow. But he's lame, he limps a bit. He expects he'll  get his discharge--but I don't think he will. We married? We've been  married six years--and he joined up the first day of the war. Oh, he  thought he'd like the life. He'd been through the South African War. No,  he was sick of it, fed up. I'm living with his father and mother--I've no  home of my own now. My people had a big farm--over a thousand acres--in  Oxfordshire. Not like here--no. Oh, they're very good to me, his father  and mother. Oh, yes, they couldn't be better. They think more of me than  of their own daughters. But it's not like being in a place of your own,  is it? You can't _really_ do as you like. No, there's only me and his  father and mother at home. Before the war? Oh, he was anything. He's had  a good education--but he liked the farming better. Then he was a  chauffeur. That's how he knew French. He was driving a gentleman in  France for a long time--'    At this point the peacocks came round the corner on a puff of wind.    'Hello, Joey!' she called, and one of the birds came forward, on delicate  legs. Its grey speckled back was very elegant, it rolled its full,  dark-blue neck as it moved to her. She crouched down. 'Joey, dear,' she  said, in an odd, saturnine caressive voice, 'you're bound to find me,  aren't you?' She put her face forward, and the bird rolled his neck,  almost touching her face with his beak, as if kissing her.    'He loves you,' I said.    She twisted her face up at me with a laugh.    'Yes,' she said, 'he loves me, Joey does,'--then, to the bird--'and I  love Joey, don't I. I _do_ love Joey.' And she smoothed his feathers for  a moment. Then she rose, saying: 'He's an affectionate bird.'    I smiled at the roll of her 'bir-rrd'.    'Oh, yes, he is,' she protested. 'He came with me from my home seven  years ago. Those others are his descendants--but they're not like  Joey--_are they, dee-urr?_' Her voice rose at the end with a witch-like  cry.    Then she forgot the birds in the cart-shed and turned to business again.    'Won't you read that letter?' she said. 'Read it, so that I know what it  says.'    'It's rather behind his back,' I said.    'Oh, never mind him,' she cried. 'He's been behind my back long  enough--all these four years. If he never did no worse things behind my  back than I do behind his, he wouldn't have cause to grumble. You read me  what it says.'    Now I felt a distinct reluctance to do as she bid, and yet I began--'My  dear Alfred.'    'I guessed that much,' she said. 'Eliza's dear Alfred.' She laughed. 'How  do you say it in French? _Eliza?_'    I told her, and she repeated the name with great contempt--_Elise_.    'Go on,' she said. 'You're not reading.'    So I began--'I have been thinking of you sometimes--have you been  thinking of me?'--    'Of several others as well, beside her, I'll wager,' said Mrs. Goyte.    'Probably not,' said I, and continued. 'A dear little baby was born here  a week ago. Ah, can I tell you my feelings when I take my darling little  brother into my arms--'    'I'll bet it's _his_,' cried Mrs. Goyte.    'No,' I said. 'It's her mother's.'    'Don't you believe it,' she cried. 'It's a blind. You mark, it's her own  right enough--and his.'    'No,' I said, 'it's her mother's.' 'He has sweet smiling eyes, but not  like your beautiful English eyes--'    She suddenly struck her hand on her skirt with a wild motion, and bent  down, doubled with laughter. Then she rose and covered her face with her  hand.    'I'm forced to laugh at the beautiful English eyes,' she said.    'Aren't his eyes beautiful?' I asked.    'Oh, yes--_very!_ Go on!--_Joey, dear, dee-urr, Joey!_'--this to the  peacock.    --'Er--We miss you very much. We all miss you. We wish you were here to  see the darling baby. Ah, Alfred, how happy we were when you stayed with  us. We all loved you so much. My mother will call the baby Alfred so that  we shall never forget you--'    'Of course it's his right enough,' cried Mrs. Goyte.    'No,' I said. 'It's the mother's.' Er--'My mother is very well. My father  came home yesterday--on leave. He is delighted with his son, my little  brother, and wishes to have him named after you, because you were so good  to us all in that terrible time, which I shall never forget. I must weep  now when I think of it. Well, you are far away in England, and perhaps I  shall never see you again. How did you find your dear mother and father?  I am so happy that your wound is better, and that you can nearly walk--'    'How did he find his dear _wife!_' cried Mrs. Goyte. 'He never told her  he had one. Think of taking the poor girl in like that!'    'We are so pleased when you write to us. Yet now you are in England you  will forget the family you served so well--'    'A bit too well--eh, _Joey!_' cried the wife.    'If it had not been for you we should not be alive now, to grieve and to  rejoice in this life, that is so hard for us. But we have recovered some  of our losses, and no longer feel the burden of poverty. The little  Alfred is a great comfort to me. I hold him to my breast and think of the  big, good Alfred, and I weep to think that those times of suffering were  perhaps"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8952"],[0,"Scientific American, Volume 22, No. 1, January 1, 1870 (#18)"],[1,"from a straight line with the said axle, the  shaft having the chain-wheel on the end directly over the engine and  connected therewith in the manner proposed by Mr. Porter, I would  suggest further that it would, perhaps, be preferable to place the  wheels at the front end, that the rudder might remain in its original  position, and the aeroport could swing behind the propellers on  encountering side currents of air, and could thus be more easily guided.  I firmly believe that Mr. Porter has taken \"the right step in the right  direction\" to accomplish that which has been so long sought, and which  evidently will be accomplished at some future time. The air will yet be  navigated by numerous flying ships, going from one city to another like  those that now cover the broad bosom of our oceans.    HIRAM VAN METER.    Macomb, Ill.           *       *       *       *       *          Puttying Floors of Jewelers Shops and Otherwise.      Messrs. Editors:--I am a reader of your valuable paper and find in  it much to interest, and many practical hints that are useful in my  vocation; I would not be without it for any consideration and I think  every mechanic in the land should take it, read it, and profit by the  reading.    I notice, in Vol. XXI, page 371, a communication headed, \"Watch  Repairers' Shop,\" in which directions are given to fill the chinks in  the floor around the work-bench with soft pine and putty, etc., etc.;  this is all well enough, but will not prevent the breaking of pivots  should a balance wheel be dropped, neither will it prevent the wheel  being stepped upon and so rendered useless, as often happens.    I am a watch-maker and jeweler, and I never drop a wheel or part of a  watch on the floor. I have an apron about one yard wide, and in the  corners of it are eyelet-holes, so that I can pin it to the bench when I  am working; I have strings to it, but do not generally tie them around  me, but let it be loose in my lap as I have to jump up, to attend to  customers in the shop. In the shop where I learned my trade (in London,  England), every workman was _compelled_ to wear an apron, and so much  waste of property and valuable time was saved; the saving of _time_ in  _one week_ will more than pay the cost of the aprons.    Sidney Plains, N. Y,    GEO. C.L. KENT.           *       *       *       *       *          Western Demand for Agricultural Implements.      Messrs. Editors:--I often think, on perusing your very valuable journal  of science, and the numerous mechanical and scientific problems it  unfolds, that the tendency of the age is to supersede all manual labor  by machinery. Whether such a thing is possible is not the question for  me to consider; I only know that the tendency of universal human genius  seems directed to that end.    I make the above observation casually, in order to introduce a few ideas  on the subject of improvement in agricultural implements--the great  _desideratum_ of the West at this moment. Here nature has opened her  stores so munificently, that all the husbandman has to do is to plow,  sow, and garner the fruits of his labor. But two great improvements are  needed to enable the western farmer to keep pace with improvements in  the mechanic arts and other kindred employment. Indeed, we at the  West, particularly, need a good, cheap, steam plow that can be made  practicable for at least the better grade of farmers. The English plan  of moldboards, that overcome all possible traction and necessitate the  duplex stationary engines, with the cumbrous \"artillery of attachments,\"  may do for sluggish people but will never meet the wants of the Yankee  nation.    The steam plow suited to the genius of our people, must, to use a  vulgarism, \"get up and go.\" It must possess sufficient power of  propulsion and traction to pulverize the ground better, deeper, and  more rapidly than the \"old way.\" Such is the want of the great West  in reference to preparing the soil for crops. I do not know of such a  machine in use, nor do I believe in the theory of Dr. Brainard, that the  moldboard is the only plan for properly pulverizing the soil; for I am  satisfied that such plan is wholly inadmissible in steam plowing in  this country, for want of sufficient traction for self-propulsion, and  observation has taught me that a self-propelling plow is the only steam  plow our people will tolerate.    I have lately examined the drawings of a steam plow invented by a  gentleman of this city (which I am not at liberty to explain in detail)  that seems to meet the great want I have spoken of. The invention  consists in a very simple device, by which the whole force of  pulverizing the ground is applied to propel the machine, and if this be  not sufficient, an independent force may be applied, so arranged as to  govern the speed of the machine at the will of the operator. You will,  no doubt, in due time hear more of this machine, which seems to me to  meet the great want so long experienced in Western cultivation.    The next great want of the West is a practical grain binder, that shall  securely bind the grain as cut. The scarcity and high price of labor  renders such a machine an absolute necessity. The efforts to supply this  great want have been numerous, but with no flattering success so far as  I am able to learn, except the machine invented by a citizen of this  place, which has already made its mark by demonstrating that automatic  machinery can and does bind the grain as fast as cut. The machine I  speak of is yet in a chrysalis state, so to speak, but it has been  worked two years in the field, the last season without missing a bundle,  though not without the usual difficulties of all new machines in respect  to the workings of some parts--too weak, etc. It is believed that  the coming harvest will witness its triumphant success. If so, the  production of our staple cereal will be greatly cheapened. I shall  be glad to renew \"old acquaintance,\" by a more detailed statement  hereafter.    I send enclosed the pay for another year of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,  which I can no more do without than my accustomed dinner.    C.    Madison, Wis.           *       *       *       *       *          Economical Steam Engine.      Messrs. Editors:--Permit me now to make a few remarks in regard to an  article on page 844, last volume of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, entitled  \"Which is the Most Economical Steam Engine?\" The principles laid down in  that article, I think are correct.    I run a saw-mill with an engine which fills those conditions nearer than  I ever saw, and I would like to give your readers a brief description  of it. The cylinder is 10-inch bore, and 14-inch stroke; steam chest  extends enough beyond the ends of the cylinder so that the steam travels  only 21/2 inches, the shortest distance possible, after leaving the valve  before it reaches the piston-head, and the space between the piston-head  and cylinder-head is only one-fourth of an inch, the bolt heads  being counter-sunk until even. Other things about this engine are in  proportion. With this engine attached to a direct acting circular mill,  I can saw 2,000 feet of hard-wood inch boards in one hour.    If any of your readers can beat this, I would like to hear from them.    JOHN CARNES.           *       *       *       *       *          Friction and Percussion.      Messrs. Editors:--In reply to \"Spectrum,\" page 358, of last volume,  I will be brief. In his third paragraph he claims that he has merely  _suggested_ that friction and percussion may often be one and the same  thing; and immediately claims that in the case of the polished button  rubbing a planed pine board, the force which overcomes and levels the  undulations of the wood, is percussion, and that percussion is also the  cause of the heat; the microscopic hills and hollows on the shining  brass button skipping and jumping along the pine, produces little  infinitesimal bumpings, and so pound out the heat. This _little_ theory  should be known to the homeopaths--they could illustrate infinitesimal  quantities by it!    \"Spectrum\" treats my hammered horsenail illustration shabbily. After  indirectly acknowledging that there is a point where hammering will  no longer produce heat, he puts it on the grindstone, subjects it to  friction, and when it burns his fingers, throws his hat in the air and  shouts \"Hurrah for _percussion!_\" We agree perfectly, except that he  calls hammering, _condensation_; calls friction, _percussion_; and drops  friction from the mechanical dictionary altogether.    A railway car axle often heats and sets fire to the packing, when the  journal is smooth as polished glass; but I never heard of those parts  of the car which are constantly undergoing percussion, even getting  uncomfortably warm. The natives of the South Pacific produce fire by  rubbing pieces of dry wood together, but I never heard of their rapping  sticks for the same purpose. I have seen a new, sharp knife made hot  enough to raise a blister, whittling a clean dry stick of pine, and  I would like to have \"Spectrum\" tell us, if in all the above cases  percussion is the cause of the evolution of of heat, and what is  friction doing in the mean time.
