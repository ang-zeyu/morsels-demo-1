We copy the following interesting paragraph from a work just issued in  London on \"The Social Condition and Education of the People of England  and Europe,\" by Joseph Kay, of Cambridge University.        \"As I have already said, the _moral, intellectual and physical      condition of the peasants and operatives_ of Prussia, Saxony      and other parts of Germany, of Holland, and of the Protestant      cantons of Switzerland, and the social condition of the      peasants in the greater part of France, _is very much higher      and happier, and very much more satisfactory, than that of      the peasants and operatives of England_; the condition of the      _poor_ in the North German, Swiss and Dutch _towns_, is as      remarkable a contrast to that of the poor of the _English      towns_ as can well be imagined; and that the condition of the      _poorer classes_ of Germany, Switzerland, Holland and France      is _rapidly improving_. The great _superiority_ of the      _preparation_ for life which a _poor man_ receives in those      countries I have mentioned, to that which a peasant or      operative receives _in England_, and the difference of the      social position of a poor man in those countries to that of      a peasant or operative in England, seem sufficient to explain      the difference which exists between the moral and social      condition of the poor of our own country and of the other      countries I have named. In Germany, Holland, and Switzerland,      a child begins its life in the society of parents who have      been educated and brought up for years in the company of      learned and gentlemanly professors, and in the society and      under the direction of a father who has been exercised in      military arts, and who has acquired the bearing, the clean and      orderly habits, and the taste for respectable attire, which      characterize the soldier. The children of these countries      spend the first six years of their lives in homes which      are well regulated. They are during this time accustomed to      orderly habits, to neat and clean clothes, and to ideas of the      value of instruction, of the respect due to the teachers,      and of the excellence of the schools, by parents who have, by      their training in early life, acquired such tastes and ideas      themselves. Each child at the age of six begins to attend a      school, which is perfectly clean, well ventilated, directed by      an able and well-educated gentleman, and superintended by the      religious ministers and by the inspectors of the Government.      Until the completion of its _fourteenth_ year, each child      continues regular daily attendance at one of these schools,      daily strengthening its habits of cleanliness and order,      learning the rudiments of useful knowledge, receiving the      principles of religion and morality, and gaining confirmed      health and physical energy by the exercise and drill of the      school playground. _No children are left idle in the streets      of the towns; no children are allowed to grovel in the      gutters; no children are allowed to make_ their appearance      at the schools dirty, or in ragged clothes; and the local      authorities are obliged to clothe all whose parents cannot      afford to clothe them. The children of the _poor_ of      Germany, Holland and Switzerland acquire stronger habits of      cleanliness, neatness and industry at the _primary_ schools,      than the children of the _small shopkeeping_ classes of      England do at the private schools of England; and they      leave the _primary schools_ of these countries _much better      instructed_ than those who leave our _middle class private      schools_. After having learnt reading, writing, arithmetic,      singing, geography, history and the Scriptures, the children      leave the schools, carrying with them into life habits of      cleanliness, neatness, order and industry, and awakened      intellect, capable of collecting truths and reasoning upon      them.\"           *       *       *       *       *      [FROM THE DUBLIN UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE.]    SUMMER PASTIME.      Do you ask how I'd amuse me      When the long bright summer comes,    And welcome leisure woos me      To shun life's crowded homes;    To shun the sultry city,      Whose dense, oppressive air    Might make one weep with pity      For those who must be there.      I'll tell you then--I would not      To foreign countries roam,    As though my fancy could not      Find occupance at home;    Nor to home-haunts of fashion      Would I, least of all, repair,    For guilt, and pride, and passion,      Have summer-quarters there.      Far, far from watering-places      Of note and name I'd keep,    For there would vapid faces      Still throng me in my sleep;    Then contact with the foolish,      The arrogant, the vain,    The meaningless--the mulish,      Would sicken heart and brain.      No--I'd seek some shore of ocean      Where nothing comes to mar    The ever-fresh commotion      Of sea and land at war;    Save the gentle evening only      As it steals along the deep,    So spirit-like and lonely,      To still the waves to sleep.      There long hours I'd spend in viewing      The elemental strife,    My soul the while subduing      With the littleness of life;    Of life, with all its paltry plans,      Its conflicts and its cares--    The feebleness of all that's man's--      The might that's God's and theirs!      And when eve came I'd listen      To the stilling of that war,    Till o'er my head should glisten      The first pure silver star;    Then, wandering homeward slowly,      I'd learn my heart the tune    Which the dreaming billows lowly,      Were murmuring to the moon!

BY T.B. THORPE.    AUTHOR OF \"TOM OWEN, THE BEE HUNTER.\"    The death of Sargeant S. Prentiss has called forth an universal  feeling of sorrow; the consciousness that \"a great man has fallen\" is  depicted upon the faces of the multitude.    The eloquent offerings to his virtues and to his genius that  everywhere follow the news of his demise, are but slight tokens of  that sorrow that fills the heart of all who knew the gifted Prentiss.  Having known him long, and having had frequent occasions to witness  exhibitions of his great mental powers, I cannot refrain from paying  an imperfect tribute to his memory.    I first met Mr. Prentiss when he was in the full maturity of his  power, but I have the pleasure of knowing hundreds who were well  acquainted with his early history and early triumphs. Volumes of  interest might be written upon the life of Mr. Prentiss. And then  his high sense of honor, his brave spirit, his nobleness of soul, his  intense but commendable pride, his classical attainments, and his deep  knowledge of the law, can scarcely be illustrated, so universal and  superior were his accomplishments and acquirements.    In his early career, I consider Mr. Prentiss both fortunate and  unfortunate. I have often imagined the shrinking but proud boy, living  unnoticed and unknown among the wealthiest citizens of the south.  Buried in the obscurity of his humble school, he looked out upon the  busy world, and measured the mighty capacities of his own soul with  those whom society had placed above him. I think I see him brooding  over his position, and longing to be free, as the suffocating man  longs for the boundless air of heaven. His hour of triumph came,  and surpassed, perhaps, his own aspirations. From the schoolroom he  entered that of the court--a chance offered--a position gained--the  law his theme, he at once not only equaled, but soared even beyond the  aim of the most favored of his compeers.    The era was one of extravagance. The virgin soil of Mississippi was  pouring into the laps of her generous sons untold abundance. There  were thousands of her citizens, full of health and talent, who adorned  excesses of living by the tasteful procurements of wealth, and the  highest accomplishments of mind. Into this world Prentiss entered,  heralded by naught save his own genius. The heirs of princely  fortunes, the descendants of heroes, men of power and place, of family  pride, of national associations, were not more proud, more gallant,  than was Prentiss, for \"he was reckoned among the noblest Romans of  them all.\"    Each step in his new fortune seemed only to elicit new qualities  for admiration. At the forum he dazzled--the jury and the judge were  confounded--the crowd carried him to the stump, and the multitude  listened as to one inspired. Fair ladies vied with each other in  waving tiny hands in token of admiration--the stolid judges of the  Supreme Court wondered at the mind of the apparent boy--even the walls  of Congress echoed forth paeans to his praise. His course was as rapid  and brilliant as that of the meteor that suddenly springs athwart the  heavens, but he was human and accomplished his task, herculean as he  was, at the price of an injured constitution.    In personal appearance Prentiss was eminently handsome, and yet  eminently manly. Although of medium height,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#19)"],[1,"vening, that it  somehow seemed to affect the events within. Be that as it may, I have  seen strange things in that tavern and heard stranger things told.    And as I sat there three sailors entered the tavern, just back, as  they said, from sea, and come with sunburned skins from a very long  voyage to the South; and one of them had a board and chessmen under  his arm, and they were complaining that they could find no one who  knew how to play chess. This was the year that the Tournament was in  England. And a little dark man at a table in a corner of the room,  drinking sugar and water, asked them why they wished to play chess;  and they said they would play any man for a pound. They opened their  box of chessmen then, a cheap and nasty set, and the man refused to  play with such uncouth pieces, and the sailors suggested that perhaps  he could find better ones; and in the end he went round to his  lodgings near by and brought his own, and then they sat down to play  for a pound a side. It was a consultation game on the part of the  sailors, they said that all three must play.    Well, the little dark man turned out to be Stavlokratz.    Of course he was fabulously poor, and the sovereign meant more to him  than it did to the sailors, but he didn't seem keen to play, it was  the sailors that insisted; he had made the badness of the sailors'  chessmen an excuse for not playing at all, but the sailors had  overruled that, and then he told them straight out who he was, and the  sailors had never heard of Stavlokratz.    Well, no more was said after that. Stavlokratz said no more, either  because he did not wish to boast or because he was huffed that they  did not know who he was. And I saw no reason to enlighten the sailors  about him; if he took their pound they had brought it upon themselves,  and my boundless admiration for his genius made me feel that he  deserved whatever might come his way. He had not asked to play, they  had named the stakes, he had warned them, and gave them the first  move; there was nothing unfair about Stavlokratz.    I had never seen Stavlokratz before, but I had played over nearly  every one of his games in the World Championship for the last three or  four years; he was always of course the model chosen by students. Only  young chess-players can appreciate my delight at seeing him play first  hand.    Well, the sailors used to lower their heads almost as low as the table  and mutter together before every move, but they muttered so low that  you could not hear what they planned.    They lost three pawns almost straight off, then a knight, and shortly  after a bishop; they were playing in fact the famous Three Sailors'  Gambit.    Stavlokratz was playing with the easy confidence that they say was  usual with him, when suddenly at about the thirteenth move I saw him  look surprised; he leaned forward and looked at the board and then at  the sailors, but he learned nothing from their vacant faces; he looked  back at the board again.    He moved more deliberately after that; the sailors lost two more  pawns, Stavlokratz had lost nothing as yet. He looked at me I thought  almost irritably, as though something would happen that he wished I  was not there to see. I believed at first that he had qualms about  taking the sailors' pound, until it dawned on me that he might lose  the game; I saw that possibility in his face, not on the board, for  the game had become almost incomprehensible to me. I cannot describe  my astonishment. And a few moves later Stavlokratz resigned.    The sailors showed no more elation than if they had won some game with  greasy cards, playing amongst themselves.    Stavlokratz asked them where they got their opening. \"We kind of  thought of it,\" said one. \"It just come into our heads like,\" said  another. He asked them questions about the ports they had touched at.  He evidently thought as I did myself that they had learned their  extraordinary gambit, perhaps in some old dependancy of Spain, from  some young master of chess whose fame had not reached Europe. He was  very eager to find out who this man could be, for neither of us  imagined that those sailors had invented it, nor would anyone who had  seen them. But he got no information from the sailors.    Stavlokratz could very ill afford the loss of a pound. He offered to  play them again for the same stakes. The sailors began to set up the  white pieces. Stavlokratz pointed out that it was his turn for the  first move. The sailors agreed but continued to set up the white  pieces and sat with the white before them waiting for him to move. It  was a trivial incident, but it revealed to Stavlokratz and myself that  none of these sailors was aware that white always moves first.    Stavlokratz played them on his own opening, reasoning of course that  as they had never heard of Stavlokratz they would not know of his  opening; and with probably a very good hope of getting back his pound  he played the fifth variation with its tricky seventh move, at least  so he intended, but it turned to a variation unknown to the students  of Stavlokratz.    Throughout this game I watched the sailors closely, and I became sure,  as only an attentive watcher can be, that the one on their left, Jim  Bunion, did not even know the moves.    When I had made up my mind about this I watched only the other two,  Adam Bailey and Bill Sloggs, trying to make out which was the master  mind; and for a long while I could not. And then I heard Adam Bailey  mutter six words, the only words I heard throughout the game, of all  their consultations, \"No, him with the horse's head.\" And I decided  that Adam Bailey did not know what a knight was, though of course he  might have been explaining things to Bill Sloggs, but it did not sound  like that; so that left Bill Sloggs. I watched Bill Sloggs after that  with a certain wonder; he was no more intellectual than the others to  look at, though rather more forceful perhaps. Poor old Stavlokratz was  beaten again.    Well, in the end I paid for Stavlokratz, and tried to get a game with  Bill Sloggs alone, but this he would not agree to, it must be all  three or none: and then I went back with Stavlokratz to his lodgings.  He very kindly gave me a game: of course it did not last long but I am  prouder of having been beaten by Stavlokratz than of any game that I  have ever won. And then we talked for an hour about the sailors, and  neither of us could make head or tail of them. I told him what I had  noticed about Jim Bunion and Adam Bailey, and he agreed with me that  Bill Sloggs was the man, though as to how he had come by that gambit  or that variation of Stavlokratz's own opening he had no theory.    I had the sailors' address which was that tavern as much as anywhere,  and they were to be there all evening. As evening drew in I went back  to the tavern, and found there still the three sailors. And I offered  Bill Sloggs two pounds for a game with him alone and he refused, but  in the end he played me for a drink. And then I found that he had not  heard of the \"en passant\" rule, and believed that the fact of checking  the king prevented him from castling, and did not know that a player  can have two or more queens on the board at the same time if he queens  his pawns, or that a pawn could ever become a knight; and he made as  many of the stock mistakes as he had time for in a short game, which I  won. I thought that I should have got at the secret then, but his  mates who had sat scowling all the while in the corner came up and  interfered. It was a breach of their compact apparently for one to  play by himself, at any rate they seemed angry. So I left the tavern  then and came back again next day, and the next day and the day after,  and often saw the sailors, but none were in a communicative mood. I  had got Stavlokratz to keep away, and they could get no one to play  chess with at a pound a side, and I would not play with them unless  they told me the secret.    And then one evening I found Jim Bunion drunk, yet not so drunk as he  wished, for the two pounds were spent; and I gave him very nearly a  tumbler of whiskey, or what passed for whiskey in that tavern at Over,  and he told me the secret at once. I had given the others some whiskey  to keep them quiet, and later on in the evening they must have gone  out, but Jim Bunion stayed with me by a little table leaning across it  and talking low, right into my face, his breath smelling all the while  of what passed for whiskey.    The wind was blowing outside as it does on bad nights in November,  coming up with moans from the South, towards which the tavern faced  with all its leaded panes, so that none but I was able to hear his  voice as Jim Bunion gave up his secret. They had sailed for years, he  told me, with Bill Snyth; and on their last voyage home Bill Snyth had  died. And he was buried at sea. Just the other side of the line they  buried him, and his pals divided his kit, and these three got his  crystal that only they knew he had, which Bill got one night in Cuba.  They played chess with the crystal.    And he was going on to tell me about that night in Cuba when Bill had  bought the crystal from the stranger, how some folks might think they  had seen thunderstorms, but let them go and listen to that one that  thundered in Cuba when Bill was buying his crystal and they'd find  that they didn't know what thunder was. But then I interrupted him,  unfortunately perhaps, for it broke the thread of his tale and set him  rambling a while, and cursing other people and talking of other lands,  China, Port Said and Spain: but I brought him back to Cuba again in  the end. I asked him how they could play chess with a crystal; and he  said that you looked at the board and looked at the crystal, and there  was the game in the crystal the same as it was on the board, with all  the odd little pieces looking just the same though smaller, horses'  heads"]]]
