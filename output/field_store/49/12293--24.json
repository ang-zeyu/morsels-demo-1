The  Queen and King send you their greeting, and beg you urgently to come and  spend some time with them (it may benefit you and cannot harm), as they  are close by.\" Erec replies: \"I am greatly obliged to the King and Queen  and to you who are, it seems, both kind of heart and of gentle mien. I  am not in a vigorous state; rather do I bear wounds within my body: yet  will I not turn aside from my way to seek a lodging-place. So you need  not longer wait: I thank you, but you may be gone.\" Now Gawain was a man  of sense. He draws back and whispers in the ear of one of the squires,  bidding him go quickly and tell the King to take measures at once to  take down and lower his tents and come and set them up in the middle of  the road three or four leagues in advance of where they now are.  There the King must lodge to-night, if he wishes to meet and extend  hospitality to the best knight in truth whom he can ever hope to see;  but who will not go out of his way for a lodging at the bidding of any  one. The fellow went and gave his message. The King without delay causes  his tents to be taken down. Now they are lowered, the sumpters loaded,  and off they set. The King mounted Aubagu, and the Queen afterwards  mounted a white Norse palfrey. All this while, my lord Gawain did not  cease to detain Erec, until the latter said to him: \"Yesterday I covered  more ground than I shall do to-day. Sire, you annoy me; let me go.  You have already disturbed a good part of my day.\" And my lord Gawain  answers him: \"I should like to accompany you a little way, if you do not  object; for it is yet a long while until night. They spent so much time  in talking that all the tents were set up before them, and Erec sees  them, and perceives that his lodging is arranged for him. \"Ah! Gawain,\"  he says, \"your shrewdness has outwitted me. By your great cunning you  have kept me here. Since it has turned out thus, I shall tell you my  name at once. Further concealment would be useless. I am Erec, who was  formerly your companion and friend.\" Gawain hears him and straightway  embraces him. He raised up his helmet and unlaced his mouthpiece.  Joyfully he clasps him in his embrace, while Erec embraces him in  turn. Then Gawain leaves him, saying, \"Sire, this news will give great  pleasure to my lord; he and my lady will both be glad, and I must go  before to tell them of it. But first I must embrace and welcome and  speak comfortably to my lady Enide, your wife. My lady the Queen has a  great desire to see her. I heard her speak of her only yesterday.\" Then  he steps up to Enide and asks her how she is, if she is well and in good  case. She makes answer courteously: \"Sire, I should have no cause for  grief, were I not in great distress for my lord; but as it is, I am in  dismay, for he has hardly a limb without a wound.\" Gawain replies: \"This  grieves me much. It is perfectly evident from his face, which is all  pale and colourless. I could have wept myself when I saw him so pale  and wan, but my joy effaced my grief, for at sight of him I felt so glad  that I forgot all other pain. Now start and ride along slowly. I shall  ride ahead at top-speed to tell the Queen and the King that you are  following after me. I am sure that they will both be delighted when they  hear it.\" Then he goes, and comes to the King's tent. \"Sire,\" he cries,  \"now you and my lady must be glad, for here come Erec and his wife.\" The  King leaps to his feet with joy. \"Upon my word!\" he says, \"right glad  I am. I could hear no news which could give me so much happiness.\" The  Queen and all the rest rejoice, and come out from the tents as fast as  they may. Even the King comes forth from his pavilion, and they met Erec  near at band. When Erec sees the King coming, he quickly dismounts,  and Enide too. The King embraces and meets them, and the Queen likewise  tenderly kisses and embraces them: there is no one that does not show  his joy. Right there, upon the spot, they took off Erec's armour; and  when they saw his wounds, their joy turned to sadness. The King draws a  deep sigh at the sight of them, and has a plaster brought which Morgan,  his sister, had made. This piaster, which Morgan had given to Arthur,  was of such sovereign virtue that no wound, whether on nerve or joint,  provided it were treated with the piaster once a day, could fail to be  completely cured and healed within a week. They brought to the King the  piaster which gave Erec great relief. When they had bathed, dried, and  bound up his wounds, the King leads him and Enide into his own royal  tent, saying that he intends, out of love for Erec, to tarry in the  forest a full fortnight, until he be completely restored to health.  For this Erec thanks the King, saying: \"Fair sire, my wounds are not so  painful that I should desire to abandon my journey. No one could detain  me; to-morrow, without delay, I shall wish to get off in the morning, as  soon as I see the dawn.\" At this the King shook his head and said: \"This  is a great mistake for you not to remain with us. I know that you are  far from well. Stay here, and you will do the right thing. It will be  a great pity and cause for grief if you die in this forest. Fair gentle  friend, stay here now until you are quite yourself again.\" Erec replies:  \"Enough of this. I have undertaken this journey, and shall not tarry in  any wise.\" The King hears that he would by no means stay for prayer of  his; so he says no more about it, and commands the supper to be prepared  at once and the tables to be spread. The servants go to make their  preparations. It was a Saturday night; so they ate fish and fruit, pike  and perch, salmon and trout, and then pears both raw and cooked. [131]  Soon after supper they ordered the beds to be made ready. The King, who  held Erec dear, had him laid in a bed alone; for he did not wish that  any one should lie with him who might touch his wounds. That night he  was well lodged. In another bed close by lay Enide with the Queen under  a cover of ermine, and they all slept in great repose until the day  broke next morning.    (Vv. 4281-4307.) Next day, as soon as it is dawn. Erec arises, dresses,  commands his horses to be saddled, and orders his arms to be brought to  him. The valets run and bring them to him. Again the King and all the  knights urge him to remain; but entreaty is of no avail, for he will not  stay for anything. Then you might have seen them all weep and show such  grief as if they already saw him dead. He puts on his arms, and Enide  arises. All the knights are sore distressed, for they think they will  never see them more. They follow them out from the tents, and send for  their own horses, that they may escort and accompany them. Erec said to  them: \"Be not angry! but you shall not accompany me a single step. I'll  thank you if you'll stay behind!\" His horse was brought to him, and he  mounts without delay. Taking his shield and lance, he commends them all  to God, and they in turn wish Erec well. Then Enide mounts, and they  ride away.    (Vv. 4308-4380.) Entering a forest, they rode on without halting till  hour of prime. While they thus traversed the wood, they heard in the  distance the cry of a damsel in great distress. When Erec heard the cry,  he felt sure from the sound that it was the voice of one in trouble and  in need of help. Straightway calling Enide, he says: \"Lady, there is  some maiden who goes through the wood calling aloud. I take it that she  is in need of aid and succour. I am going to hasten in that direction  and see what her trouble is. Do you dismount and await me here, while  I go yonder.\" \"Gladly, sire,\" she says. Leaving her alone, he makes his  way until he found the damsel, who was going through the wood, lamenting  her lover whom two giants had taken and were leading away with very  cruel treatment. The maiden was rending her garments, and tearing her  hair and her tender crimson face. Erec sees her and, wondering greatly,  begs her to tell him why she cries and weeps so sore. The maiden cries  and sighs again, then sobbing, says: \"Fair sire, it is no wonder if I  grieve, for I wish I were dead. I neither love nor prize my life, for my  lover has been led away prisoner by two wicked and cruel giants who are  his mortal enemies. God! what shall I do? Woe is me! deprived of the  best knight alive, the most noble and the most courteous. And now he  is in great peril of death. This very day, and without cause, they will  bring him to some vile death. Noble knight, for God's sake, I beg you to  succour my lover, if now you can lend him any aid. You will not have to  run far, for they must still be close by.\" \"Damsel,\" says Erec, \"I will  follow them, since you request it, and rest assured that I shall do all  within my power: either I shall be taken prisoner along with him, or  I shall restore him to you safe and sound. If the giants let him live  until I can find him, I intend to measure my strength with theirs.\"  \"Noble knight,\" the maiden said, \"I shall always be your servant if you  restore to me my lover. Now go in God's name, and make haste, I beseech  you.\" \"Which way lies their path?\" \"This way, my lord. Here is the path  with the footprints.\" Then Erec started at a gallop, and told her to  await him there. The maid commends him to the Lord, and prays God very  fervently that He should give him force by His command to discomfit  those who intend evil toward her lover.    (Vv. 4381-4579.) Erec went off along the trail, spurring his horse in  pursuit of the giants. He followed in pursuit of them until he caught  sight of them before they emerged from the wood; he saw the knight with  bare limbs mounted naked on a nag, his hands and feet bound as if he  were arrested for highway robbery. The giants had no lances, shields or  whetted swords; but they both had clubs and scourges, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#18)"],[1,"minstrelsy to the  fair guest as she sat by Robin's side, the golden arrow gleaming in  her dark hair. The others all joined in the chorus, from Will Scarlet's  baritone to Friar Tuck's heavy bass. Even Little John essayed to sing,  although looked at threateningly by Much the miller's son.    Then Robin bade Marian repeat her message from the Queen, which Marian  did in a way befitting the dignity of her royal mistress. After which  the yeomen gave three cheers for the Queen and three more for her page,  and drank toasts to them both, rising to their feet.    \"Ye have heard,\" quoth Robin standing forth, \"how that Her Majesty--whom  God preserve!--wishes but four men to go with me. Wherefore, I choose  Little John and Will Stutely, my two lieutenants, Will Scarlet, my  cousin, and Allan-a-Dale, my minstrel. Mistress Dale, also, can go with  her husband and be company for the Queen's page. We will depart with  early morning, decked in our finest. So stir ye, my lads! and see that  not only your tunics are fresh, but your swords bright and your bows  and arrows fit. For we must be a credit to the Queen as well as the good  greenwood. You, Much, with Stout Will, Lester, and John, the widow's  three sons, shall have command of the band while we are away; and Friar  Tuck shall preside over the needs of your souls and stomachs.\"    The orders were received with shouts of approval, and toasts all around  were drunk again in nut-brown ale, ere the company dispersed to rest  after making ready for the journey.    The next morning was as fine a summer's day as ever you want to see, and  the green leaves of the forest made a pleasing background for the gay  picture of the yeomen setting forth. Says the old ballad--it was a  seemly sight to see how Robin Hood himself had dressed, and all his  yeomanry. He clothed his men in Lincoln green, and himself in scarlet  red, with hats of black and feathers white to bravely deck each head.  Nor were the two ladies behind-hand, I ween, at the bedecking.    Thus the chosen party of seven sallied forth being accompanied to the  edge of the wood by the whole band, who gave them a merry parting and  Godspeed!    The journey to London town was made without incident. The party  proceeded boldly along the King's highroad, and no man met them who was  disposed to say them nay. Besides, the good Queen's warrant and ring  would have answered for them, as indeed it did at the gates of London.  So on they sped and in due course came to the palace itself and awaited  audience with the Queen.    Now the King had gone that day to Finsbury Field, where the tourney was  soon to be held, in order to look over the lists and see some of his  picked men whom he expected to win against all comers. So much had he  boasted of these men, that the Queen had secretly resolved to win a  wager of him. She had heard of the fame of Robin Hood and his yeomen, as  Marian had said; and Marian on her part had been overjoyed to be able to  add a word in their favor and to set out in search of them.    To-day the Queen sat in her private audience-room chatting pleasantly  with her ladies, when in came Mistress Marian Fitzwalter attired again  as befitted her rank of lady-in-waiting. She courtesied low to the Queen  and awaited permission to speak.    \"How now!\" said the Queen smiling; \"is this my lady Marian, or the page,  Richard Partington?\"    \"Both, an it please Your Majesty. Richard found the man you sought,  while Marian brought him to you.\"    \"Where is he?\" asked Queen Eleanor eagerly.    \"Awaiting your audience--he and four of his men, likewise a lady of  whose wooing and wedding I can tell you a pretty story at another time.\"    \"Have them admitted.\"    So Marian gave orders to a herald, and presently Robin Hood and his  little party entered the room.    Now the Queen had half-expected the men to be rude and uncouth in  appearance, because of their wild life in the forest; but she was  delightfully disappointed. Indeed she started back in surprise and  almost clapped her hands. For, sooth to say, the yeomen made a brave  sight, and in all the court no more gallant men could be found. Marian  felt her cheeks glow with pride, at sight of the half-hidden looks of  admiration sent forth by the other ladies-in-waiting.    Robin had not forgot the gentle arts taught by his mother, and he wore  his fine red velvet tunic and breeches with the grace of a courtier.  We have seen, before, what a dandified gentleman Will Scarlet was; and  Allan-a-Dale, the minstrel, was scarcely less goodly to look upon.  While the giant Little John and broad-shouldered Will Stutely made up in  stature what little they lacked in outward polish. Mistress Dale, on her  part, looked even more charming, if possible, than on the momentous day  when she went to Plympton Church to marry one man and found another.    Thus came the people of the greenwood before Queen Eleanor, in her own  private audience room. And Robin advanced and knelt down before her, and  said:    \"Here I am, Robin Hood--I and my chosen men! At Your Majesty's bidding  am I come, bearing the ring of amnesty which I will protect--as I would  protect Your Majesty's honor--with my life!\"    \"Thou art welcome, Lockesley,\" said the Queen smiling graciously.    \"Thou art come in good time, thou and all thy brave yeomanry.\"    Then Robin presented each of his men in turn, and each fell on his  knee and was greeted with most kindly words. And the Queen kissed fair  Mistress Dale upon the cheek, and bade her remain in the palace with her  ladies while she was in the city. And she made all the party be seated  to rest themselves after their long journey. Fine wines were brought,  and cake, and rich food, for their refreshment. And as they ate and  drank, the Queen told them further of the tourney to be held at Finsbury  Field, and of how she desired them to wear her colors and shoot for her.  Meantime, she concluded, they were to lie by quietly and be known of no  man.    To do all this, Robin and his men pledged themselves full heartily. Then  at the Queen's request, they related to her and her ladies some of their  merry adventures; whereat the listeners were vastly entertained, and  laughed heartily. Then Marian, who had heard of the wedding at Plympton  Church, told it so drolly that tears stood in the Queen's eyes from  merriment.    \"My lord Bishop of Hereford!\" she said, \"'Twas indeed a comical business  for him! I shall keep that to twit his bones, I promise you! So this is  our minstrel?\" she added presently, turning to Allan-a-Dale. \"Methinks I  have already heard of him. Will he not harp awhile for us to-day?\"    Allan bowed low, and took a harp which was brought to him, and he  thrummed the strings and sang full sweetly the border songs of the North  Countree. And the Queen and all her ladies listened in rapt silence till  all the songs were ended.          CHAPTER XIII    HOW THE OUTLAWS SHOT IN KING HARRY'S TOURNEY         The King is into Finsbury Field       Marching in battle 'ray,       And after follows bold Robin Hood,       And all his yeomen gay.    The morning of the great archery contest dawned fair and bright,  bringing with it a fever of impatience to every citizen of London town,  from the proudest courtier to the lowest kitchen wench. Aye, and all the  surrounding country was early awake, too, and began to wend their way to  Finsbury Field, a fine broad stretch of practice ground near Moorfields.  Around three sides of the Field were erected tier upon tier of seats,  for the spectators, with the royal boxes and booths for the nobility  and gentry in the center. Down along one end were pitched gaily colored  tents for the different bands of King's archers. There were ten of  these bands, each containing a score of men headed by a captain of great  renown; so to-day there were ten of the pavilions, each bearing aloft  the Royal Arms and vari-colored pennants which fluttered lightly in the  fresh morning breeze.    Each captain's flag was of peculiar color and device. First came the  royal purple streamer of Tepus, own bow-bearer to the King, and esteemed  the finest archer in all the land. Then came the yellow of Clifton of  Buckinghamshire; and the blue of Gilbert of the White Hand--he who was  renowned in Nottinghamshire; and the green of Elwyn the Welshman; and  the White of Robert of Cloudesdale; and, after them, five other captains  of bands, each a man of proved prowess. As the Queen had said aforetime,  the King was mightily proud of his archers, and now held this tourney to  show their skill and, mayhap, to recruit their forces.    The uprising tiers of seats filled early, upon this summer morning, and  the merry chatter of the people went abroad like the hum of bees in a  hive. The royal party had not yet put in an appearance, nor were any  of the King's archers visible. So the crowd was content to hide its  impatience by laughing jibes passed from one section to another, and  crying the colors of their favorite archers. In and out among the seats  went hawkers, their arms laden with small pennants to correspond with  the rival tents. Other vendors of pie and small cakes and cider also did  a thrifty business, for so eager had some of the people been to get good  seats, that they had rushed away from home without their breakfast.    Suddenly the gates at the far end, next the tents, opened wide, and a  courier in scarlet and gold, mounted upon a white horse, rode in  blowing lustily upon the trumpet at his lips; and behind him came six  standard-bearers riding abreast. The populace arose with a mighty cheer.  King Harry had entered the arena. He bestrode a fine white charger  and was clad in a rich dark suit of slashed velvet with satin and gold  facings. His hat bore a long curling ostrich plume of pure white and he  doffed it graciously in answer to the shouts of the people. By his  side rode Queen Eleanor, looking regal and charming in"]]]
