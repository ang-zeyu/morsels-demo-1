We  should have considerably strengthened Italy's position on the  Mediterranean, and created a cause of contention between Italy and  France that would have added to the security of the Triple Alliance.      The weakness of this alliance consists in its purely defensive  character. It offers a certain security against hostile aggression, but  does not consider the necessary development of events, and does not  guarantee to any of its members help in the prosecution of its essential  interests. It is based on a _status quo_, which was fully justified in  its day, but has been left far behind by the march of political events.  Prince Bismarck, in his \"Thoughts and Reminiscences,\" pointed out that  this alliance would not always correspond to the requirements of the  future. Since Italy found the Triple Alliance did not aid her  Mediterranean policy, she tried to effect a pacific agreement with  England and France, and accordingly retired from the Triple Alliance.  The results of this policy are manifest to-day. Italy, under an  undisguised arrangement with England and France, but in direct  opposition to the interests of the Triple Alliance, attacked Turkey, in  order to conquer, in Tripoli, the required colonial territory. This  undertaking brought her to the brink of a war with Austria, which, as  the supreme Power in the Balkan Peninsula, can never tolerate the  encroachment of Italy into those regions.    The Triple Alliance, which in itself represents a natural league, has  suffered a rude shock. The ultimate reason for this result is found in  the fact that the parties concerned with a narrow, short-sighted policy  look only to their immediate private interests, and pay no regard to  the vital needs of the members of the league. The alliance will not  regain its original strength until, under the protection of the allied  armies, each of the three States can satisfy its political needs. We  must therefore be solicitous to promote Austria's position in the  Balkans, and Italy's interests on the Mediterranean. Only then can we  calculate on finding in our allies assistance towards realizing our own  political endeavours. Since, however, it is against all our interests to  strengthen Italy at the cost of Turkey, which is, as we shall see, an  essential member of the Triple Alliance, we must repair the errors of  the past, and in the next great war win back Tunis for Italy. Only then  will Bismarck's great conception of the Triple Alliance reveal its real  meaning. But the Triple Alliance, so long as it only aims at negative  results, and leaves it to the individual allies to pursue their vital  interests exclusively by their own resources, will be smitten with  sterility. On the surface, Italy's Mediterranean interests do not  concern us closely. But their real importance for us is shown by the  consideration that the withdrawal of Italy from the Triple Alliance, or,  indeed, its secession to an Anglo-Franco-Russian _entente,_ would  probably be the signal for a great European war against us and Austria.  Such a development would gravely prejudice the lasting interests of  Italy, for she would forfeit her political independence by so doing, and  incur the risk of sinking to a sort of vassal state of France. Such a  contingency is not unthinkable, for, in judging the policy of Italy, we  must not disregard her relations with England as well as with France.    England is clearly a hindrance in the way of Italy's justifiable efforts  to win a prominent position in the Mediterranean. She possesses in  Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, and Aden a chain of strong bases, which  secure the sea-route to India, and she has an unqualified interest in  commanding this great road through the Mediterranean. England's  Mediterranean fleet is correspondingly strong and would--especially in  combination with the French Mediterranean squadron--seriously menace the  coasts of Italy, should that country be entangled in a war against  England _and_ France. Italy is therefore obviously concerned in avoiding  such a war, as long as the balance of maritime power is unchanged. She  is thus in an extremely difficult double position; herself a member of  the Triple Alliance, she is in a situation which compels her to make  overtures to the opponents of that alliance, so long as her own allies  can afford no trustworthy assistance to her policy of development. It is  our interest to reconcile Italy and Turkey so far as we can.    France and Russia have united in opposition to the Central European  Triple Alliance. France's European policy is overshadowed by the idea of  _revanche_. For that she makes the most painful sacrifices; for that she  has forgotten the hundred years' enmity against England and the  humiliation of Fashoda. She wishes first to take vengeance for the  defeats of 1870-71, which wounded her national pride to the quick; she  wishes to raise her political prestige by a victory over Germany, and,  if possible, to regain that former supremacy on the continent of Europe  which she so long and brilliantly maintained; she wishes, if fortune  smiles on her arms, to reconquer Alsace and Lorraine. But she feels too  weak for an attack on Germany. Her whole foreign policy, in spite of all  protestations of peace, follows the single aim of gaining allies for  this attack. Her alliance with Russia, her _entente_ with England, are  inspired with this spirit; her present intimate relations with this  latter nation are traceable to the fact that the French policy hoped,  and with good reason, for more active help from England's hostility to  Germany than from Russia.    The colonial policy of France pursues primarily the object of acquiring  a material, and, if possible, military superiority over Germany. The  establishment of a native African army, the contemplated introduction of  a modified system of conscription in Algeria, and the political  annexation of Morocco, which offers excellent raw material for soldiers,  so clearly exhibit this intention, that there can be no possible  illusion as to its extent and meaning.    Since France has succeeded in bringing her military strength to  approximately the same level as Germany, since she has acquired in her  North African Empire the possibility of considerably increasing that  strength, since she has completely outstripped Germany in the sphere of  colonial policy, and has not only kept up, but also revived, the French  sympathies of Alsace and Lorraine, the conclusion is obvious: France  will not abandon the paths of an anti-German policy, but will do her  best to excite hostility against us, and to thwart German interests in  every quarter of the globe. When she came to an understanding with the  Italians, that she should be given a free hand in Morocco if she allowed  them to occupy Tripoli, a wedge was driven into the Triple Alliance  which threatens to split it. It may be regarded as highly improbable  that she will maintain honourably and with no _arriere-pensee_ the  obligations undertaken in the interests of German commerce in Morocco.  The suppression of these interests was, in fact, a marked feature of the  French Morocco policy, which was conspicuously anti-German. The French  policy was so successful that we shall have to reckon more than ever on  the hostility of France in the future. It must be regarded as a quite  unthinkable proposition that an agreement between France and Germany can  be negotiated before the question between them has been once more  decided by arms. Such an agreement is the less likely now that France  sides with England, to whose interest it is to repress Germany but  strengthen France. Another picture meets our eyes if we turn to the  East, where the giant Russian Empire towers above all others.    The Empire of the Czar, in consequence of its defeat in Manchuria, and  of the revolution which was precipitated by the disastrous war, is  following apparently a policy of recuperation. It has tried to come to  an understanding with Japan in the Far East, and with England in Central  Asia; in the Balkans its policy aims at the maintenance of the _status  quo_. So far it does not seem to have entertained any idea of war with  Germany. The Potsdam agreement, whose importance cannot be  overestimated, shows that we need not anticipate at present any  aggressive policy on Russia's part. The ministry of Kokowzew seems  likely to wish to continue this policy of recuperation, and has the more  reason for doing so, as the murder of Stolypin with its accompanying  events showed, as it were by a flash of lightning, a dreadful picture of  internal disorder and revolutionary intrigue. It is improbable,  therefore, that Russia would now be inclined to make armed intervention  in favour of France. The Russo-French alliance is not, indeed, swept  away, and there is no doubt that Russia would, if the necessity arose,  meet her obligations; but the tension has been temporarily relaxed, and  an improvement in the Russo-German relations has been effected, although  this state of things was sufficiently well paid for by the concessions  of Germany in North Persia.    It is quite obvious that this policy of marking time, which Russia is  adopting for the moment, can only be transitory. The requirements of the  mighty Empire irresistibly compel an expansion towards the sea, whether  in the Far East, where it hopes to gain ice-free harbours, or in the  direction of the Mediterranean, where the Crescent still glitters on the  dome of St. Sophia. After a successful war, Russia would hardly hesitate  to seize the mouth of the Vistula, at the possession of which she has  long aimed, and thus to strengthen appreciably her position in the  Baltic.

A  singular change of feeling came over him. He tried the handle, but the  bolts were shot. He knocked gently. Charlotte did not hear him. She was  walking rapidly up and down in the large dressing-room adjoining. She  was repeating over and over what, since the Count's unexpected proposal,  she had often enough had to say to herself. The Captain seemed to stand  before her. At home, and everywhere, he had become her all in all. And  now he was to go; and it was all to be desolate again. She repeated  whatever wise things one can say to oneself; she even anticipated, as  people so often do, the wretched comfort that time would come at last to  her relief; and then she cursed the time which would have to pass before  it could lighten her sufferings--she cursed the dead, cold time when  they would be lightened. At last she burst into tears; they were the  more welcome, since tears with her were rare. She flung herself on the  sofa, and gave herself up unreservedly to her sufferings. Edward,  meanwhile, could not take himself from the door. He knocked again; and a  third time rather louder; so that Charlotte, in the stillness of the  night, distinctly heard it, and started up in fright. Her first thought  was--it can only be, it must be, the Captain; her second, that it was  impossible. She thought she must have been deceived. But surely she had  heard it; and she wished, and she feared to have heard it. She went into  her sleeping-room, and walked lightly up to the bolted tapestry-door.  She blamed herself for her fears. \"Possibly it may be the Baroness  wanting something,\" she said to herself; and she called out quietly and  calmly, \"Is anybody there?\" A light voice answered, \"It is I.\" \"Who?\"  returned Charlotte, not being able to make out the voice. She thought  she saw the Captain's figure standing at the door. In a rather louder  tone, she heard the word \"Edward!\" She drew back the bolt, and her  husband stood before her. He greeted her with some light jest. She was  unable to reply in the same tone. He complicated the mysterious visit by  his mysterious explanation of it.    \"Well, then,\" he said at last, \"I will confess, the real reason why I am  come is, that I have made a vow to kiss your shoe this evening.\"    \"It is long since you thought of such a thing as that,\" said Charlotte.    \"So much the worse,\" he answered; \"and so much the better.\"    She had thrown herself back in an armchair, to prevent him from seeing  the slightness of her dress. He flung himself down before her, and she  could not prevent him from giving her shoe a kiss. And when the shoe  came off in his hand, he caught her foot and pressed it tenderly against  his breast.    Charlotte was one of those women who, being of naturally calm  temperaments, continue in marriage, without any purpose or any effort,  the air and character of lovers. She was never expressive toward her  husband; generally, indeed, she rather shrank from any warm  demonstration on his part. It was not that she was cold, or at all hard  and repulsive, but she remained always like a loving bride, who draws  back with a kind of shyness even from what is permitted. And so Edward  found her this evening, in a double sense. How sorely did she not long  that her husband would go; the figure of his friend seemed to hover in  the air and reproach her. But what should have had the effect of driving  Edward away only attracted him the more. There were visible traces of  emotion about her. She had been crying; and tears, which with weak  persons detract from their graces, add immeasurably to the  attractiveness of those whom we know commonly as strong and  self-possessed.    Edward was so agreeable, so gentle, so pressing; he begged to be allowed  to stay with her. He did not demand it, but half in fun, half in  earnest, he tried to persuade her; he never thought of his rights. At  last, as if in mischief, he blew out the candle.    In the dim lamplight, the inward affection, the imagination, maintained  their rights over the real; it was Ottilie that was resting in Edward's  arms; and the Captain, now faintly, now clearly, hovered before  Charlotte's soul. And so, strangely intermingled, the absent and the  present flowed in a sweet enchantment one into the other.    And yet the present would not let itself be robbed of its own unlovely  right. They spent a part of the night talking and laughing at all sorts  of things, the more freely as the heart had no part in it. But when  Edward awoke in the morning, on his wife's breast, the day seemed to  stare in with a sad, awful look, and the sun to be shining in upon a  crime. He stole lightly from her side; and she found herself, with  strange enough feelings, when she awoke, alone.          CHAPTER XII      When the party assembled again at breakfast, an attentive observer might  have read in the behavior of its various members the different things  which were passing in their inner thoughts and feelings. The Count and  the Baroness met with the air of happiness which a pair of lovers feel,  who, after having been forced to endure a long separation, have mutually  assured each other of their unaltered affection. On the other hand,  Charlotte and Edward equally came into the presence of the Captain and  Ottilie with a sense of shame and remorse. For such is the nature of  love that it believes in no rights except its own, and all other rights  vanish away before it. Ottilie was in child-like spirits. For her--she  was almost what might be called open. The Captain appeared serious. His  conversation with the Count, which had roused in him feelings that for  some time past had been at rest and dormant, had made him only too  keenly conscious that here he was not fulfilling his work, and at bottom  was but squandering himself in a half-activity of idleness.    Hardly had their guests departed, when fresh visitors were announced--to  Charlotte most welcomely, all she wished for being to be taken out of  herself, and to have her attention dissipated. They annoyed Edward, who  was longing to devote himself to Ottilie; and Ottilie did not like them  either; the copy which had to be finished the next morning early being  still incomplete. They staid a long time, and immediately that they were  gone she hurried off to her room.    It was now evening. Edward, Charlotte, and the Captain had accompanied  the strangers some little way on foot, before the latter got into their  carriage, and previous to returning home they agreed to take a walk  along the water-side.    A boat had come, which Edward had had fetched from a distance, at no  little expense; and they decided that they would try whether it was easy  to manage. It was made fast on the bank of the middle pond, not far from  some old ash trees on which they calculated to make an effect in their  future improvements. There was to be a landing-place made there, and  under the trees a seat was to be raised, with some wonderful  architecture about it: it was to be the point for which people were to  make when they went across the water.    \"And where had we better have the landing-place on the other side?\" said  Edward. \"I should think under my plane trees.\"    \"They stand a little too far to the right,\" said the Captain. \"You are  nearer the castle if you land further down. However, we must think about  it.\"    The Captain was already standing in the stern of the boat, and had taken  up an oar. Charlotte got in, and Edward with her--he took the other oar;  but as he was on the point of pushing off, he thought of Ottilie--he  recollected that this water-party would keep him out late; who could  tell when he would get back? He made up his mind shortly and promptly;  sprang back to the bank, and reaching the other oar to the Captain,  hurried home--making excuses to himself as he ran.    Arriving there he learnt that Ottilie had shut herself up--she was  writing. In spite of the agreeable feeling that she was doing something  for him, it was the keenest mortification to him not to be able to see  her. His impatience increased every moment. He walked up and down the  large drawing-room; he tried a thousand things, and could not fix his  attention upon any. He was longing to see her alone, before Charlotte  came back with the Captain. It was dark by this time, and the candles  were lighted.    At last she came in beaming with loveliness: the sense that she had done  something for her friend had lifted all her being above itself. She put  down the original and her transcript on the table before Edward.    \"Shall we collate them?\" she said, with a smile.    Edward did not know what to answer. He looked at her--he looked at the  transcript. The first few sheets were written with the greatest  carefulness in a delicate woman's hand--then the strokes appeared to  alter, to become more light and free--but who can describe his surprise  as he ran his eyes over the concluding page? \"For heaven's sake,\" he  cried, \"what is this? this is my hand!\" He looked at Ottilie, and again  at the paper; the conclusion, especially, was exactly as if he had  written it himself. Ottilie said nothing, but she looked at him with her  eyes full of the warmest delight. Edward stretched out his arms. \"You  love me!\" he cried: \"Ottilie, you love me!\" They fell on each other's  breast--which had been the first to catch the other it would have been  impossible to distinguish.    From that moment the world was all changed for Edward. He was no longer  what he had been, and the world was no longer what it had been. They  parted--he held her hands; they gazed in each other's eyes. They were on  the point of embracing each other again.    Charlotte entered with the Captain. Edward inwardly smiled at their  excuses for having stayed out so long. Oh! how far too soon you have  returned, he said to himself.    They sat down to supper. They talked about the people who had been there  that day. Edward, full of love and"]]]
