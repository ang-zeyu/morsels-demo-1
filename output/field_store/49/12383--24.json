The succeeding night was filled with the most anxious thoughts. When a  momentary oblivion stole upon her senses, her distempered imagination  conjured up a thousand images of violence and falsehood; she saw herself  in the hands of her determined enemies, who did not hesitate by the most  daring treachery to complete her ruin. Her waking thoughts were not more  consoling. The struggle was too great for her constitution. As morning  approached, she resolved, at all hazards, to put herself into the hands  of Grimes. This determination was no sooner made, than she felt her  heart sensibly lightened. She could not conceive any evil which could  result from this proceeding, that deserved to be put in the balance  against those which, under the roof of her kinsman, appeared  unavoidable.    When she communicated her determination to Grimes, it was not possible  to say whether he received pleasure or pain from the intimation. He  smiled indeed; but his smile was accompanied by a certain abrupt  ruggedness of countenance, so that it might equally well be the smile of  sarcasm or of congratulation. He, however, renewed his assurances of  fidelity to his engagements and punctuality of execution. Meanwhile the  day was interspersed with nuptial presents and preparations, all  indicating the firmness as well as security of the directors of the  scene. Emily had hoped that, as the crisis approached, they might have  remitted something of their usual diligence. She was resolved, in that  case, if a fair opportunity had offered, to give the slip both to her  jailors, and to her new and reluctantly chosen confederate. But, though  extremely vigilant for that purpose, she found the execution of the idea  impracticable.    At length the night, so critical to her happiness, approached. The mind  of Emily could not fail, on this occasion, to be extremely agitated. She  had first exerted all her perspicacity to elude the vigilance of her  attendant. This insolent and unfeeling tyrant, instead of any  relentings, had only sought to make sport of her anxiety. Accordingly,  in one instance she hid herself, and, suffering Emily to suppose that  the coast was clear, met her at the end of the gallery, near the top of  the staircase. \"How do you do, my dear?\" said she, with an insulting  tone. \"And so the little dear thought itself cunning enough to outwit  me, did it? Oh, it was a sly little gipsy! Go, go back, love; troop!\"  Emily felt deeply the trick that was played upon her. She sighed, but  disdained to return any answer to this low vulgarity. Being once more in  her chamber, she sat down in a chair, and remained buried in reverie for  more than two hours. After this she went to her drawers, and turned  over, in a hurrying confused way, her linen and clothes, having in her  mind the provision it would be necessary to make for her elopement. Her  jailor officiously followed her from place to place, and observed what  she did for the present in silence. It was now the hour of rest. \"Good  night, child,\" said this saucy girl, in the act of retiring. \"It is time  to lock up. For the few next hours, the time is your own. Make the best  use of it! Do'ee think ee can creep out at the key-hole, lovey? At eight  o'clock you see me again. And then, and then,\" added she, clapping her  hands, \"it is all over. The sun is not surer to rise, than you and your  honest man to be made one.\"    There was something in the tone with which this slut uttered her  farewell, that suggested the question to Emily, \"What does she mean? Is  it possible that she should know what has been planned for the few next  hours?\"--This was the first moment that suspicion had offered itself,  and its continuance was short. With an aching heart she folded up the  few necessaries she intended to take with her. She instinctively  listened, with an anxiety that would almost have enabled her to hear the  stirring of a leaf. From time to time she thought her ear was struck  with the sound of feet; but the treading, if treading it were, was so  soft, that she could never ascertain whether it were a real sound, or  the mere creature of the fancy. Then all was still, as if the universal  motion had been at rest. By and by she conceived she overheard a noise  as of buzzing and low-muttered speech. Her heart palpitated; for a  second time she began to doubt the honesty of Grimes. The suggestion was  now more anxious than before; but it was too late. Presently she heard  the sound of a key in her chamber-door, and the rustic made his  appearance. She started, and cried, \"Are we discovered? did not I hear  you speak?\" Grimes advanced on tiptoe with his finger to his lip. \"No,  no,\" replied he, \"all is safe!\" He took her by the hand, led her in  silence out of the house, and then across the garden. Emily examined  with her eye the doors and passages as they proceeded, and looked on all  sides with fearful suspicion; but every thing was as vacant and still as  she herself could have wished. Grimes opened a back-door of the garden  already unlocked, that led into an unfrequented lane. There stood two  horses ready equipped for the journey, and fastened by their bridles to  a post not six yards distant from the garden. Grimes pushed the door  after them.    \"By Gemini,\" said he, \"my heart was in my mouth. As I comed along to  you, I saw Mun, coachey, pop along from the back-door to the stables. He  was within a hop, step, and jump of me. But he had a lanthorn in his  hand, and he did not see me, being as I was darkling.\" Saying this, he  assisted Miss Melville to mount. He troubled her little during the  route; on the contrary, he was remarkably silent and contemplative, a  circumstance by no means disagreeable to Emily, to whom his conversation  had never been acceptable.    After having proceeded about two miles, they turned into a wood, through  which the road led to the place of their destination. The night was  extremely dark, at the same time that the air was soft and mild, it  being now the middle of summer. Under pretence of exploring the way,  Grimes contrived, when they had already penetrated into the midst of  this gloomy solitude, to get his horse abreast with that of Miss  Melville, and then, suddenly reaching out his hand, seized hold of her  bridle. \"I think we may as well stop here a bit,\" said he.    \"Stop!\" exclaimed Emily with surprise; \"why should we stop? Mr. Grimes,  what do you mean?\"    \"Come, come,\" said he, \"never trouble yourself to wonder. Did you think  I were such a goose, to take all this trouble merely to gratify your  whim? I' faith, nobody shall find me a pack-horse, to go of other folks'  errands, without knowing a reason why. I cannot say that I much minded  to have you at first; but your ways are enough to stir the blood of my  grand-dad. Far-fetched and dear-bought is always relishing. Your consent  was so hard to gain, that squire thought it was surest asking in the  dark. A' said however, a' would have no such doings in his house, and  so, do ye see, we are comed here.\"    \"For God's sake, Mr. Grimes, think what you are about! You cannot be  base enough to ruin a poor creature who has put herself under your  protection!    \"Ruin! No, no, I will make an honest woman of you, when all is done.  Nay, none of your airs; no tricks upon travellers! I have you here as  safe AS a horse in a pound; there is not a house nor a shed within a  mile of us; and, if I miss the opportunity, call me spade. Faith, you  are a delicate morsel, and there is no time to be lost!\"    Miss Melville had but an instant in which to collect her thoughts. She  felt that there was little hope of softening the obstinate and  insensible brute in whose power she was placed. But the presence of mind  and intrepidity annexed to her character did not now desert her. Grimes  had scarcely finished his harangue, when, with a strong and unexpected  jerk, she disengaged the bridle from his grasp, and at the same time put  her horse upon full speed. She had scarcely advanced twice the length of  her horse, when Grimes recovered from his surprise, and pursued her,  inexpressibly mortified at being so easily overreached. The sound of his  horse behind served but to rouse more completely the mettle of that of  Emily; whether by accident or sagacity, the animal pursued without a  fault the narrow and winding way; and the chase continued the whole  length of the wood.    At the extremity of this wood there was a gate. The recollection of this  softened a little the cutting disappointment of Grimes, as he thought  himself secure of putting an end, by its assistance, to the career of  Emily; nor was it very probable that any body would appear to interrupt  his designs, in such a place, and in the dead and silence of the night.  By the most extraordinary accident, however, they found a man on  horseback in wait at this gate. \"Help, help!\" exclaimed the affrighted  Emily; \"thieves! murder! help!\" The man was Mr. Falkland. Grimes knew  his voice; and therefore, though he attempted a sort of sullen  resistance, it was feebly made. Two other men, whom, by reason of the  darkness, he had not at first seen, and who were Mr. Falkland's  servants, hearing the bustle of the rencounter, and alarmed for the  safety of their master, rode up; and then Grimes, disappointed at the  loss of his gratification, and admonished by conscious guilt, shrunk  from farther parley, and rode off in silence.    It may seem strange that Mr. Falkland should thus a second time have  been the saviour of Miss Melville, and that under circumstances the most  unexpected and singular. But in this instance it is easily to be  accounted for. He had heard of a man who lurked about this wood for  robbery or some other bad design, and that it was conjectured this man  was Hawkins, another of the victims of Mr. Tyrrel's rural tyranny,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11344"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 415, December 15, 1883 (#19)"],[1,"ion: THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY'S GARDENS.

PART IV.    By NELSON H. DARTON.      Montville, Morris County, New Jersey.--This locality is an old one, and  well known to mineralogists. It is outside of the limits prescribed in  introducing this series of paper, but by only a few miles, and being  such an interesting locality, I have included it in the granular  limestone, which occurs in a small isolated ridge in the gneiss within a  space of ten acres, about two miles north of the railroad station of  Montville, on the Boonton Branch of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and  Western Railroad, and is reached by a road running north from about a  mile east of the railroad station. This road branches into two at the  limestone kilns, about a mile from the railroad track, and the left hand  branch is taken, which leads more directly to the quarry, which is on  the right hand, about a mile further on, and quite conspicuous by the  loose rock lying in front of the quarry. It is on the property of a Mr.  John J. Gordon, and produces a very fine limestone for use in the  furnaces and forges in the vicinity, as well as lime for agricultural  purposes, it being the only limestone in the vicinity for fifteen miles.  Between it and its walk of gneiss occur veins of the minerals so  characteristic of the locality, and for which it has become  famous--serpentine, asbestos, phlozopite, gurhofite pyrites, biotite,  aragonite, dolomite, tremolite, and possibly others in lesser quantity.    _Serpentine_.--All the varieties of this species, and of every color  from nearly white to black, is profusely distributed through the  limestone in the lower or main quarry in veins and pockets. It is  generally soft, translucent, and to be found in masses from a pea to a  cubic foot in size. Much of it is of a pure oil green color, rich and  translucent, making a very fine and attractive looking mineral specimen.  No difficulty need be experienced in producing all the varieties of this  mineral, as much has been removed and may be found in the vicinity of  the quarry, as it is always carefully separated from the limestone as  being useless, and thrown aside, or in some instances, when of peculiar  beauty, sold as specimens. The variety of serpentine known as marmolite,  which is made up of numberless plates of the mineral packed together  similar to mica, but of the green color of the serpentine picolite, or  fibrous serpentine, also frequently occurs of a light grass green color,  and is a very interesting variety.    In selecting specimens of serpentine, care should be taken to procure  that which is the most translucent, and that holding miniature veins of  asbestos. These are not so plentiful as those of the pure serpentine  alone, but occur in the southern end of the main quarry. The width of  these veins of asbestos is seldom over an inch, but those of even much  less are highly prized as specimens. These veins of asbestos are, in  places, several inches in length, but are generally much broken in  removing them, as their fibrous structure, at right angles to their  length, makes them very fragile, and pure specimens of asbestos can  seldom be found. However, they make much finer specimens when with the  serpentine. Frequently these specimens may be obtained with a layer of  gurhofite above them, and separated by the serpentine; this assortment  is very interesting, revealing to us the manner in which they were  formed, which was by a process termed segregation.    This gurhofite, called bone  by the quarrymen, occurs in white, dense looking masses, intermingled  with the serpentine, especially in the upper end of the quarry, where  veins six and eight inches in thickness are abundant, and from which  specimens may be readily obtained showing the fibrous structure of the  gurhofite and the association with the serpentine, to which it is found  attached; it is quite different from the limestone in appearance, and  need not be mistaken for it.    _Phlozopite_.--In a vein near the lower end of the quarry, near the  asbestos locality, occurs large plates of this mineral, which is a  variety of mica, and has all of the characteristics of a pure silvery  white color, and from one by three inches in area to less. It is easily  separable in folia, and cannot be confounded with any of the other  minerals. A huge mass of the veinstone holding abundance of this mineral  is exposed, whence it may be plentifully obtained in excellent crystals.    _Pyrites_.--White and yellow iron pyrites are abundant in the gneissic  rock adjoining the limestone, and frequently very fine, perfect crystals  may be found handsomely dressed upon the rock. There is no particular  portion of the quarries in which they abound.    _Biotite_.--This is a variety of mica in small crystals, of a dark brown  color, and quite plentiful in the gneiss inclosing the veins of  limestone. Up in the older quarries it is more abundant; on the north  wall of the vein it is often in very fine specimens, and there even in  large number, in a locality, generally a pocket in the gneiss.    _Tremolite_ is quite abundant on a large mass of limestone in the  extreme upper quarry, which is a short distance east of the main one,  over a small hill. The tremolite occurs in white crystals, about a  quarter inch in width and from a half to three inches in length. The  crystals are opaque, but very smooth and glistening, lining cavities in  this mass of limestone. It is a variety of hornblende, composed of  silica, lime, and magnesia, with a little alumina. It probably occurs in  places in the vicinity of this block, and in finer specimens, as these  are frequently, when near the surface, much weathered and worn. This is  a characteristic granular limestone mineral, and a very interesting one.  We will again meet it when examining the New York city localities.    _Aragonite_ occurs in very small masses, of a light yellow color and  fibrous structure, between layers of serpentine. When they are separated  by a small interspace, as it frequently is, the fibers are very large,  coarse, and brittle, and thus do not resemble asbestos, although in some  instances they might be mistaken for picolite, but, distinguished from  it by effervescing on contact with a drop of acid, as it is a carbonate  of lime, and also containing a trace of iron. I have never seen any fine  specimens of it from this locality, but deeper down in the rock it may  occur in greater profusion.    Dolomite occurs to a limited extent as such; most of it, being in the  form of gurhofite crystals, may be occasionally found with aragonite of  a light pearly gray color and rhombohedral crystals. As before noticed,  Staten Island is the best locality for this species.    _Calcite_.--In places the limestone is perfectly crystallized, and of a  pure white or other color, when it forms an attractive mineral, and  often worth removing. The limestone of the main quarry, carefully  averaged, was found to have the following chemical composition.      Lime.                11.09    Magnesia.            37.94    Carbonic acid.       30.61    Silica.              10.22    Water and loss.       4.90    Iron and alumina.     5.24                        ------                        100.00    In places it is spotted with the serpentine, and judging from its rough  state resembles \"_verde antique_,\" and at that of a beautiful color;  samples of this should be obtained.    _Feldspar_.--This mineral occurs very plentfully in the space between  the limestones and gneiss. It is generally of a flesh red color and  often in very perfect crystals, in some instances an inch and a half in  length; as its hardness is 6, it can be readily distinguished from  calcite, which it much resembles, but which has only a hardness of 3,  and dissolves with effervescence in acids.    A visit to this locality is a delightful manner in which to spend a  holiday or other time of leisure; and as it affords so many interesting  and valuable minerals, it forms a very profitable trip as well. In  reaching it many interesting localities are passed, and if one has an  early start these may all be visited. I will describe a few of these,  which are alike possessors of beautiful scenery and instructing  geological features and not far from the main line of travel.    Starting from the Erie depot, on the Greenwood Lake road, the first stop  may be at Arlington, about seven miles west of Jersey City. Here a visit  to the Schuyler copper mine may be profitably taken; and as I have  written a full account of this locality in a previous portion of these  articles,[1] I will not reiterate it here, but refer to that paper. The  mine, I might add, is only a mile north of the railroad station, and on  Schuyler Avenue, a short distance north from its junction with the  Jersey City and Paterson turnpike. Coming back to Arlington depot, and  walking on the track for about a quarter of a mile west through the deep  cut, the manner in which the sandstones and shales which constitute so  large a portion of New Jersey are laid and arranged can be seen to great  advantage, this being one of the finest exposures in the formation. At a  point about equidistant from either end is a fault in the layers of  shales and sandstone; this fault is noticeable as a slight irregularity  in the otherwise continuous sides of the cut, and is a point at which  the layers of rock on the east have fallen vertically, the western side  remaining in its original position. This fault has a thrust of only  three feet, but is an instructive example of faults which occur on a  tremendous scale in some of the other formations. It will be noticed  that between the two edges of the separated layers there is a deposit of  a talcky substance, which has"]]]
