Trinity Church has a plain, yet pleasing, chancel. It is neat and  good, simple yet well-proportioned and elegant. The chancel window  is but sparingly stained; still it has a tasteful and rather stately  appearance. Amber is the most prominent colour in it, and loyalty  the principal virtue represented on it. There are a few small  emblematic-looking characters towards the base, which few can make  out; but everybody can see and understand the rather large English  outburst of loyalty surmounting the window. The display consists of  the Royal arms, well and broadly defined, with a crown above them,  and a lion above all. This speaks well for the lion, which ought to  be satisfied. Plain Gothic-bordered tablets, with a central  monogram, occupy the wall below the window. They have a good effect,  and give a somewhat artistic richness to the chancel. Within and at  each end of the communion rails there is a fine old oak chair. Both  are beautifully carved and are valuable. The reading-desk and the  pulpit are placed opposite each other, and at the sides of the  chancel. They are very tall, but altitude rather improves than  diminishes their appearance. They are well made, are fashioned of  dark oak, and have carved Gothic canopies. We have seen nothing so  tall nor so respectable-looking in the arena of virtuous rostrumdom  for a long period. On each side of the pulpit-desk there is a small  circular hole, and those said holes have a history. \"What are they  used for?\" said we one day, whilst in the pulpit, to a friend near  us. \"For?\" said the sagacious party, \"they are for nothing;\" and  then followed a history which we thus summarise for the benefit of  parsons in general:- A few years ago a gentleman with a red-hot dash  of Hibernian blood in his veins was the curate here. When he came,  the stands of two gas lights were fixed in the holes named; but one  Sunday, when wilder than usual, he gave the bottom of the right-hand  stand a vehement beating, smashed his ring in the encounter, and  frightened the incumbent, who, being apprehensive as to the fate of  the two stands and their globes, had them shifted further back and  more out of the curate's reach. They were in imminent peril every  minute, and a change was really necessary.    Not many years ago--plenty of people can remember it--the  congregation of Trinity Church was both large and influential. The  elements of influence and the representatives of wealth may still be  seen in it; but few and far between are the worshippers. Pews may be  owned, seats may be taken, few sittings may be to let, but where are  the worshippers? What a pity it is, that a church of proportions so  goodly, an edifice with accomodation so capacious, a building with  arrangements so substantial and excellent should be deserted in a  manner so absolute? A screw of large dimensions is loose somewhere.  The population of the district seems great--dense; many of the  people round about the church stand singularly in need of entire  acres of virtue, some of them are thorough-going heathens, and think  heathenism a rather jolly thing at times. And yet this most  excellent church is comparatively empty--desolate--reminding one  painfully of Ossian's picture of Balclutha's walls. The congregation  of Trinity Church is better than it was a few years ago, but it is  still lamentably, small. There is often \"a beggarly account of empty  boxes\"--a great deal of nothing in the church, and how to remedy  this defect is a problem. The present congregation consists of a  very moderate number of middle class people, a few elderly well-to-  do individuals, a thin scattering of poor folk, and a small body of  Sunday school scholars. The Recorder of Preston, who has been  connected with the management of the church since the time it was  opened, attends regularly when health permits:  Trinity Church is,  of course, in the hands of trustees, and as people of an inquiring  turn of mind sometimes wonder who they are we will give their names.  Here are the trustees:  Mr. T. B. Addison, Mr. John Cooper, Mr.  Thos. Walmsley, Mr. John Swainson, Mr. John Bickerstaffe, Mr. Thomas  Houlker, and Mr. Isaac Gate. The present churchwardens are Mr. W.  Fort and Mr. W. H. Smith, and they have discharged their duties--  looked after the church, kept it clean, preserved its order--in  thoroughly commendable style. Testimonials are due for their  services.    The music at Trinity Church has for a considerable period been a  troublesome, irregular, unsatisfactory thing. Years ago it was fine;  there was full cathedral service in the church then; and the  orchestral performances were attractive. But dullness and poorness  are now their characteristics. The organ is one of the best in the  town; its tones are fine and musical; it could perhaps be improved  in one or two particulars; but everything in it is good as far as it  goes. The tunes, however, which come from it are of a very ordinary  character. Some of them may be tasteful; but the bulk seem weak and  wearisome--lack fine-flowing harmony, and can neither be joined in  nor appreciated by many parties. The members of the choir are not a  very lustrous class of vocalists; but they do their best, and appear  to fight through the musical fog surrounding them very patiently. We  believe the tunes are selected by the incumbent. If so, let us hope  that he will see the propriety of recognising something a little  brisker and more classical--something rather livelier and more  popularly relishable. Many clergymen simply select the hymns and  leave the music to the choir:  the incumbent might try this plan as  an experiment. Squabbling about music, carping, and fighting, and  biting about it, have in the past done much harm to Trinity Church.  There is more peace now than there used to be amongst the singers;  but there will never be very much contentment, and never much  harmony of music, until they are permitted to moderately follow the  custom of other places--to swim with the tide--and have a reasonable  share of their own way. Singers can, as a rule, quarrel enough among  themselves when in the enjoyment of the fullest privileges; and  interference with their services, if they are really worth anything,  only makes them more ill-natured, angular, and combative. They are  awkward people to deal with, and have strange likings for \"hot  water.\"    The minister of Trinity Church is the Rev. J. T. Brown, and his  salary amounts to about 300 pounds a year. He was christened at the  place; was in after years curate of it; and is now its incumbent.  About two years ago, when he came to the church in the last-named  capacity, the congregation was wretchedly thin--awfully scarce, and  just on the borders of invisibility. It has since improved a little;  but working up a forsaken place into real activity is a difficult  task, which at times staggers the ablest of men. Mr. Brown is a  scholar, and a thoroughly upright man. He believes not in fighting  down other people's creeds; never rails against religious  antagonists; has a natural dislike to platform bigotry and pulpit  wrathfulness; is generously inclined; will give but not lend;  objects to everything in the shape of loud clerical display; is  strongly evangelical in his tastes; is exact, and calm, and orderly,  even to the cut of his whiskers; won't be brought out and exhibited;  doesn't care about seeing other people make exhibitions; and thinks  every minister should mind his own business, and leave other people  alone. But he is far too good for a parson. A gentle melancholy  seems to have got hold of him. He always preaches sincerely; a quiet  spirit of simple unadorned, piety pervades his remarks--but he  depresses you too much; and is rather predisposed to a calm mournful  consideration of the great sulphur question. He never gets into a  lurid passion, never horrifies, but calmly saddens you, in his  discourses. He is fond of quoting good old Richard Baxter and John  Banyan, and he might have worse authorities. But he is very serious,  and his words sometimes chill like a condensation of Young's \"Night  Thoughts.\" If he had more dash and blithesomeness in him, if he  could fling a little more of this world's logic into his sermons, if  he would periodically blow his own trumpet very audibly, and make a  smart \"spread\" now and then, he would gather force. The best of  things will sink if there be not some noise and show made about  them. If Mr. Brown knew the \"Holloway's Pills and Ointment\" theory  better than he does, he would have a fuller congregation; but he is  too honest and too good for superficial emblazonry, and he believes  in quietness.    Trinity Church has some excellent schools for boys, girls, and  infants. The attendance is only poor; but it is better than it was.  The boys' school is improving; that of the girls is also recruiting  the strength it lost last Whitsuntide but one, when a number of its  attendants left in a body because Mr. Brown objected to a display of  orange and blue ribbons which they were senselessly enamoured of;  and with respect to the infants they are regularly growing in size  if not in numbers. Mrs. Brown, wife of the incumbent, not only  industriously visits the district, like a genuine Christian lady as  she is, but teaches in the girls school, and at intervals when at  church--here is an example for parsons' wives--looks after a number  of the scholars personally, whilst her own servants are quietly  occupying the family pew. We could like to see both the church and  the schools of Mr. Brown full; he has our best wishes in this  respect; and we hope he may find some talisman by which the  difficulty will be satisfactorily solved.

Astronomy is therefore  the oldest of the ancient sciences, although it remained imperfect for  more than four thousand years. The old Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks  made but few discoveries which are valued by modern astronomers, but  they laid the foundation of the science, and ever regarded it as one of  the noblest subjects that could stimulate the faculties of man. It was  invested with all that was religious and poetical.    The spacious level and unclouded horizon of Chaldaea afforded peculiar  facilities of observation; and its pastoral and contemplative  inhabitants, uncontaminated by the vices and superstitions of subsequent  ages, active-minded and fresh, discovered after a long observation of  eclipses--some say extending over nineteen centuries--the cycle of two  hundred and twenty-three lunations, which brings back the eclipses in  the same order. Having once established their cycle, they laid the  foundation for the most sublime of all the sciences. Callisthenes  transmitted from Babylon to Aristotle a collection of observations of  all the eclipses that preceded the conquests of Alexander, together with  the definite knowledge which the Chaldaeans had collected about the  motions of the heavenly bodies. Such knowledge was rude and simple, and  amounted to little beyond the fact that there were spherical  revolutions about an inclined axis, and that the poles pointed always to  particular stars. The Egyptians also recorded their observations, from  which it would appear that they observed eclipses at least sixteen  hundred years before the beginning of our era,--which is not improbable,  if the speculations of modern philosophers respecting the age of the  world are entitled to credit. The Egyptians discovered by the rising of  Sirius that the year consists of three hundred and sixty-five and  one-quarter days; and this was their sacred year, in distinction from  the civil, which consisted of three hundred and sixty-five days. They  also had observed the courses of the planets, and could explain the  phenomena of the stations and retrogradations; and it is asserted too  that they regarded Mercury and Venus as satellites of the sun. Some have  maintained that the obelisks which the Egyptians erected served the  purpose of gnomons for determining the obliquity of the ecliptic, the  altitude of the pole, and the length of the tropical year. It is thought  even that the Pyramids, by the position of their sides toward the  cardinal points, attest Egyptian acquaintance with a meridional line.  The Chinese boast of having noticed and recorded a series of eclipses  extending over a period of thirty-eight hundred and fifty-eight years;  and it is probable that they anticipated the Greeks two thousand years  in the discovery of the Metonic cycle,--or the cycle of nineteen years,  at the end of which time the new moons fall on the same days of the  year. The Chinese also determined the obliquity of the ecliptic eleven  hundred years before our era. The Hindus at a remote antiquity  represented celestial phenomena with considerable exactness, and  constructed tables by which the longitude of the sun and moon were  determined, and dials to measure time. Bailly thinks that thirty-one  hundred and two years before Christ astronomy was cultivated in Siam  which hardly yields in accuracy to that which modern science has built  on the theory of universal gravitation.    But the Greeks after all were the only people of antiquity who elevated  astronomy to the dignity of a science. They however confessed that they  derived their earliest knowledge from the Babylonian and Egyptian  priests, while the priests of Thebes claimed to be the originators of  exact astronomical observations. Diodorus asserts that the Chaldaeans  used the Temple of Belus, in the centre of Babylon, for their survey of  the heavens. But whether the Babylonians or the Egyptians were the  earliest astronomers is of little consequence, although the pedants make  it a grave matter of investigation. All we know is that astronomy was  cultivated by both Babylonians and Egyptians, and that they made but  very limited attainments. They approximated to the truth in reference  to the solar year, by observing the equinoxes and solstices and the  heliacal rising of particular stars.    The early Greek philosophers who visited Egypt and the East in search of  knowledge, found very little to reward their curiosity or industry,--not  much beyond preposterous claims to a high antiquity, and to an esoteric  wisdom which has not yet been revealed. Plato and Eudoxus spent thirteen  years in Heliopolis for the purpose of extracting the scientific  knowledge of the Egyptian priests, yet they learned but little beyond  the fact that the solar year was a trifle beyond three hundred and  sixty-five days. No great names have come down to us from the priests of  Babylon or Egypt; no one gained an individual reputation. The Chaldaean  and Egyptian priests may have furnished the raw material of observation  to the Greeks, but the latter alone possessed the scientific genius by  which undigested facts were converted into a symmetrical system. The  East never gave valuable knowledge to the West; it gave the tendency to  religious mysticism, which in its turn tended to superstition. Instead  of astronomy, it gave astrology; instead of science, it gave magic,  incantations, and dreams. The Eastern astronomers connected their  astronomy with divination from the stars, and made their antiquity reach  back to two hundred and seventy thousand years. There were soothsayers  in the time of Daniel, and magicians, exorcists, and interpreters of  signs. They were not men of scientific research, seeking truth; it was  power they sought, by perverting the intellect of the people. The  astrology of the East was founded on the principle that a star or  constellation presided over the birth of an individual, and that it  either portended his fate, or shed a good or bad influence upon his  future life. The star which looked upon a child at the hour of his birth  was called the \"horoscopus,\" and the peculiar influence of each planet  was determined by the astrologers. The superstitions of Egypt and  Chaldaea unfortunately spread among both the Greeks and Romans, and  these were about all that the Western nations learned from the boastful  priests of occult Oriental science. Whatever was known of real value  among the ancients is due to the earnest inquiries of the Greeks.    And yet their researches were very unsatisfactory until the time of  Hipparchus. The primitive knowledge was almost nothing. The Homeric  poems regarded the earth as a circular plain bounded by the heaven,  which was a solid vault or hemisphere, with its concavity turned  downward. This absurdity was believed until the time of Herodotus, five  centuries after; nor was it exploded fully in the time of Aristotle. The  sun, moon, and stars were supposed to move upon or with the inner  surface of the heavenly hemisphere, and the ocean was thought to gird  the earth around as a great belt, into which the heavenly bodies sank at  night. Homer believed that the sun arose out of the ocean, ascended the  heaven, and again plunged into the ocean, passing under the earth, and  producing darkness. The Greeks even personified the sun as a divine  charioteer driving his fiery steeds over the steep of heaven, until he  bathed them at evening in the western waves. Apollo became the god of  the sun, as Diana was the goddess of the moon. But the early Greek  inquirers did not attempt to explain how the sun found his way from the  west back again to the east; they merely took note of the diurnal  course, the alternation of day and night, the number of the seasons, and  their regular successions. They found the points of the compass by  determining the recurrence of the equinoxes and solstices; but they had  no conception of the ecliptic,--of that great circle in the heaven  formed by the sun's annual course,--and of its obliquity when compared  with our equator. Like the Egyptians and Babylonians, the Greeks  ascertained the length of the year to be three hundred and sixty-five  days; but perfect accuracy was lacking, for want of scientific  instruments and of recorded observations of the heavenly bodies. The  Greeks had not even a common chronological era for the designation of  years. Herodotus informs us that the Trojan War preceded his time by  eight hundred years: he merely states the interval between the event in  question and his own time; he had certain data for distant periods. The  Greeks reckoned dates from the Trojan War, and the Romans from the  building of their city. The Greeks also divided the year into twelve  months, and introduced the intercalary circle of eight years, although  the Romans disused it afterward, until the calendar was reformed by  Julius Caesar. Thus there was no scientific astronomical knowledge worth  mentioning among the primitive Greeks.    Immense research and learning have been expended by modern critics to  show the state of scientific astronomy among the Greeks. I am amazed  equally at the amount of research and its comparative worthlessness; for  what addition to science can be made by an enumeration of the  puerilities and errors of the Greeks, and how wasted and pedantic the  learning which ransacks all antiquity to prove that the Greeks adopted  this or that absurdity![1]    [Footnote 1: The style of modern historical criticism is well  exemplified in the discussions of the Germans whether the Arx on the  Capitoline Hill occupied the northeastern or southwestern corner, which  take up nearly one half of the learned article on the Capitoline in  Smith's Dictionary.]    The earliest historic name"]]]
