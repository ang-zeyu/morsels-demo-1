Think of our Freddie being alone in the world like that!\"    Mrs. Bobbsey could hardly keep her tears back. She stooped over and  kissed Sandy.    \"Do you know my mamma?\" he asked, looking straight into the lady's kind  face.    \"Mrs. Manily is your mamma, isn't she?\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Yes, she's my number two mamma, but I mean number one that used to  sleep with me.\"    \"Come now, Sandy,\" laughed Mrs. Manily. \"Didn't you tell me last night  I was the best mamma in the whole world?\" and she hugged the little  fellow to make him happy again.    \"So you are,\" he laughed, forgetting all his loneliness now. \"When I  get to be a big man I'm goin' to take you out carriage riding.\"    \"Can't Sandy cone home with us?\" asked Freddie. \"He can sleep in my  bed.\"    \"You are very good,\" said the matron. \"But we cannot let any of our  children go visiting without special permission from the Society.\"    \"Well,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"if you get the permission we will be very  glad to have Sandy pay us a visit. We have a large place, and would  really like to have some good poor child enjoy it. We have company now,  but they will leave us soon, and then perhaps we could have a little  fresh-air camp of our own.\"    \"The managers have asked us to look for a few private homes that could  accommodate some special cases,\" replied Mrs. Manily, \"and I am sure I  can arrange it to have Sandy go.\"    \"Oh, let him come now,\" pleaded Freddie, as Sandy held tight to his  hand. \"See, we have room in the wagon.\"    \"Well, he might have a ride,\" consented the matron, and before anyone  had a chance to speak again Freddie and Sandy had climbed into the  wagon.    Nan and Mildred had been talking to some of the older girls, who were  very nice and polite for girls who had no one to teach them at home,  and Nan declared that she was coming over to the camp to play with them  some whole day.    \"We can bring our lunch,\" said Mildred, \"and you can show us all the  pleasant play-places you have fixed up in stones over the  mountain-side.\"    One girl, Nellie by name, seemed very smart and bright, and she brought  to Mrs. Bobbsey a bunch of ferns and wild flowers she had just gathered  while showing Nan and Mildred around.    \"You certainly have a lovely place here,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, as they  got ready to leave, \"and you little girls will be quite strong and  ready for school again when you go back to the city.\"    \"I don't go to school,\" said Nellie rather bashfully.    \"Why?\" asked Aunt Sarah.    \"Oh, I go to night school,\" said the little girl. \"But in the daytime I  have to work.\"    \"Why, how old are you?\" asked Aunt Sarah.    \"Twelve,\" said Nellie shyly.    \"Working at twelve years of age!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey in surprise.  \"What do you do?\"    \"I'm a cash-girl in a big store,\" said Nellie with some pride, for many  little girls are not smart enough to hold such a position.    \"I thought all children had to go to school,\" Aunt Sarah said to Mrs.  Manily.    \"So they do,\" replied the matron, \"but in special cases they get  permission from the factory inspector. Then they can work during the  day and go to school at night.\"    \"I think it's a shame!\" said the mother. \"That child is not much larger  than Nan, and to think of her working in a big store all day, then  having to work at night school too!\"    \"It does not seem right!\" admitted the matron; \"but, you see, sometimes  there is no choice. Either a child must work or go to an institution,  and we strain every point to keep them in their homes.\"    \"We will drive back with Sandy,\" said Aunt Sarah as they got into the  wagon.    \"Can't Nellie come too?\" asked Nan. \"There is plenty of room.\"    The matron said yes, and so the little party started off for a ride  along the pretty road.    \"I was never in a carriage before in all my life,\" said Nellie  suddenly. \"Isn't it grand!\"    \"Never!\" exclaimed the other girls in surprise.    \"No,\" said Nellie. \"I've had lots of rides in trolley cars, and we had  a ride in a farm wagon the other day, but this is the first time I have  ever been in a carriage.\"    Aunt Sarah was letting Sandy drive, and he, of course, was delighted.  Freddie enjoyed it almost as well as Sandy did, and kept telling him  which rein to pull on and all that. Old Bill, the horse, knew the road  so well he really didn't need any driver, but he went along very nicely  with the two little boys talking to him.    \"We will stop and have some soda at the postoffice,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.  For the postoffice was also a general store.    This was good news to everybody, and when the man came out for the  order Aunt Sarah told him to bring cakes too.    Everybody liked the ice cream soda, but it was plain Nellie and Sandy  had not had such a treat in a long time.    \"This is the best fun I've had!\" declared the little cash-girl,  allowing how grateful she was. \"And I hope you'll come and see us  again,\" she added politely to Mildred and Nan.    \"Oh, we intend to,\" said Mildred. \"You know, we are going to have a  sewing school to make aprons for the little ones at the camp.\"    Old Bill had turned back to the fresh-air quarters again, and soon, too  soon, Sandy was handed back to Mrs. Manily, while Nellie jumped down  and said what a lovely time she had had.    \"Now be sure to come, Sandy,\" called Freddie, \"'cause I'll expect you!\"    \"I will,\" said Sandy rather sadly, for he would rather have gone along  right then.    \"And I'll let you play with Snoop and my playthings,\" Freddie called  again. \"Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye,\" answered the little fresh children.    Then old Bill took the others home.        CHAPTER XIX    SEWING SCHOOL    \"Let's get Mabel and all the others,\" said Nan to Mildred. \"We ought to  take at least six gingham aprons and three nightgowns over to the camp.\"    Aunt Sarah had turned a big long attic room into a sewing school where  Nan and Mildred had full charge. Flossie was to look after the spools  of thread, keeping them from tangling up, and the girls agreed to let  Freddie cut paper patterns.    This was not a play sewing school but a real one, for Aunt Sarah and  Mrs. Bobbsey were to do the operating or machine sewing, while the  girls were to sew on tapes, buttons, overhand seams, and do all that.    Mildred and Nan invited Mabel, Nettie, Marie Brenn (she was visiting  the Herolds), Bessie, and Anna Thomas, a big girl who lived over  Lakeside way.    \"Be sure to bring your thimbles and needles,\" Nan told them. \"And come  at two o'clock this afternoon.\"    Every girl came--even Nettie, who was always so busy at home.    Mrs. Bobbsey sat at the machine ready to do stitching while Aunt Sarah  was busy \"cutting out\" on a long table in front of the low window.    \"Now, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, \"we have ready some blue  gingham aprons. You see how they are cut out; two seams, one at each  side, then they are to be closed down the back. There will be a pair of  strings on each apron, and you may begin by pressing down a narrow hem  on these strings. We will not need to baste them, just press them down  with the finger this way.\"    Mrs. Bobbsey then took up a pair of the sashes and turned in the edges.  Immediately the girls followed her instructions, and very soon all of  the strings were ready for the machine.    Nan handed them to her mother, and then Aunt Sarah gave out the work.    \"Now these are the sleeves,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"and they must each have  little gathers brought in at the elbow here between these notches. Next  you place the sleeve together notch to notch, and they can be stitched  without basting.\"    \"Isn't it lively to work this way?\" said Mildred. \"It isn't a bit of  trouble, and see how quickly we get done.\"    \"Many hands make light work,\" replied Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I guess we will  get all the aprons finished this afternoon.\"    Piece by piece the various parts of the garments were given out, until  there remained nothing more to do than to put on buttons and work  buttonholes, and overhand the arm holes.    \"I'll cut the buttonholes,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, \"then Nan and Mildred  may work the buttonholes by sticking a pin through each hole. The other  girls may then sew the buttons on.\"    It was wonderful how quickly those little pearl buttons went down the  backs of the aprons.    \"I believe I could make an apron all alone now,\" said Nan, \"if it was  cut out.\"    \"So could I,\" declared Mildred. \"It isn't hard at all.\"    \"Well, here's my patterns,\" spoke up Freddie, who with Flossie had been  busy over in the corner cutting \"ladies\" out of a fashion paper.    \"No, they're paper dolls,\" said Flossie, who was standing them all up  in a row, \"and we are going to give them to the fresh-air children to  play with on rainy days.\"    It was only half-past four when Nan rang the bell to dismiss the sewing  school.    \"We have had such a lovely time,\" said Mabel, \"we would like to have  sewing to do every week.\"    \"Well, you are welcome to come,\" said Aunt Sarah. \"We will make night  dresses for the poor little ones next week, then after that you might  all bring your own work, mending, fancywork or tidies, whatever you  have to do.\"    \"And we might each pay five cents to sew for the fresh-air children,\"  suggested Mildred.    \"Yes, all charity sewing classes have a fund,\" Mrs. Bobbsey remarked.  \"That would be a good idea.\"    \"Now let us fold up the aprons,\" said Nan. \"Don't they look pretty?\"    And indeed the half-dozen blue-and-white ginghams did look very nice,  for they were carefully made and all smooth and even.    \"When can we iron them out?\" asked Flossie, anxious to deliver the  gifts to the needy little ones.    \"To-morrow afternoon,\" replied her mother. \"The boys are going to pick  vegetables in the morning, and we will drive over in the afternoon.\"    Uncle Daniel had given the boys permission to pick all the butter-be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#18)"],[1,"when it  was made; but after it was made, he would abide by it until it was  reversed.  Just so!  We let this property abide by the decision, but we  will try to reverse that decision.  We will try to put it where Judge  Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it until it is  reversed.  Somebody has to reverse that decision, since it is made, and  we mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.    \"What are the uses of decisions of Courts?  They have two uses.  As  rules of property they have two uses.  First, they decide upon the  question before the Court.  They decide in this case that Dred Scott is  a Slave.  Nobody resists that.  Not only that, but they say to everybody  else, that persons standing just as Dred Scott stands, are as he is.  That is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person, it  will be so decided again, unless the Court decides in another way  --unless the Court overrules its decision.--Well, we mean to do what we  can to have the Court decide the other way.  That is one thing we mean  to try to do.    \"The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a  degree of sacredness that has never before been thrown around any other  decision.  I have never heard of such a thing.  Why, decisions  apparently contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were  contrary to that decision, have been made by that very Court before.  It  is the first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history.  It is a  new wonder of the world.  It is based upon falsehood in the main as to  the facts--allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at  all in many instances; and no decision made on any question--the first  instance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances  --thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has  always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled  law.  But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this  extraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary circumstances,  and give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it and  obey it in every possible sense.    \"Circumstances alter cases.  Do not gentlemen remember the case of that  same Supreme Court, some twenty-five or thirty years ago, deciding that  a National Bank was Constitutional?  * * *  The Bank charter ran out,  and a recharter was granted by Congress.  That re-charter was laid  before General Jackson.  It was urged upon him, when he denied the  Constitutionality of the Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that  it was Constitutional; and General Jackson then said that the Supreme  Court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a co-ordinate branch of  the Government, the members of which had sworn to support the  Constitution--that each member had sworn to support that Constitution as  he understood it.  I will venture here to say, that I have heard Judge  Douglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act.  What has  now become of all his tirade about 'resistance to the Supreme Court?'\"    After adverting to Judge Douglas's warfare on \"the leaders\" of the  Republican party, and his desire to have \"it understood that the mass of  the Republican party are really his friends,\" Mr. Lincoln said: \"If you  indorse him, you tell him you do not care whether Slavery be voted up or  down, and he will close, or try to close, your mouths with his  declaration repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the year.  Is  that what you mean?  * * *  Now I could ask the Republican party, after  all the hard names that Judge Douglas has called them by, all his  repeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes--all  his declarations of Black Republicanism--by the way, we are improving,  the black has got rubbed off--but with all that, if he be indorsed by  Republican votes, where do you stand?  Plainly, you stand ready saddled,  bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the  Slavery-extension camp of the Nation--just ready to be driven over, tied  together in a lot--to be driven over, every man with a rope around his  neck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas.  That is the question.  If Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think  that they has better not do it.  * * *    \"We were often--more than once at least--in the course of Judge  Douglas's speech last night, reminded that this Government was made for  White men--that he believed it was made for White men.  Well, that is  putting it in a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge  then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not  warranted.  I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic  which presumes that because I do not want a Negro woman for a Slave I do  necessarily want her for a wife.  My understanding is that I need not  have her for either; but, as God has made us separate, we can leave one  another alone, and do one another much good thereby.  There are White  men enough to marry all the White women, and enough Black men to marry  all the Black women, and in God's name let them be so married.  The  Judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the  mixture of races; that the inferior race bears the superior down.  Why,  Judge, if we do not let them get together in the Territories, they won't  mix there.    \" * * * Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be  treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as  much is to be done for them as their condition will allow--what are  these arguments?  They are the arguments that Kings have made for  enslaving the People in all ages of the World.  You will find that all  the arguments in favor of king-craft were of this class; they always  bestrode the necks of the People, not that they wanted to do it, but  because the People were better off for being ridden!  That is their  argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old Serpent that  says: you work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it.    \"Turn it whatever way you will--whether it come from the mouth of a  King, an excuse for enslaving the People of his Country, or from the  mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another  race, it is all the same old Serpent; and I hold, if that course of  argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind  that we should not care about this, should be granted, it does not stop  with the Negro.    \"I should like to know, taking this old Declaration of Independence,  which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making  exceptions to it, where will it stop?  If one man says it does not mean  a Negro, why not say it does not mean some other man?  If that  Declaration is not the truth, let us get the Statute Book, in which we  find it, and tear it out!  Who is so bold as to do it?  If it is not  true, let us tear it out!\"  [Cries of \"No, no.\"]  \"Let us stick to it  then; let us stand firmly by it, then.  * * *    \" * * * The Saviour, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature  could be perfect as the Father in Heaven; but He said, 'As your Father  in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.'  He set that up as a  standard, and he who did most toward reaching that standard, attained  the highest degree of moral perfection.  So I say, in relation to the  principle that all men are created equal--let it be as nearly reached as  we can.  If we cannot give Freedom to every creature, let us do nothing  that will impose Slavery upon any other creature.  Let us then turn this  Government back into the channel in which the framers of the  Constitution originally placed it.  Let us stand firmly by each other.  * * *  Let us discard all this quibbling * * *  and unite as one People  throughout this Land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that  all men are created equal.\"    At Bloomington, July 16th (Mr. Lincoln being present), Judge Douglas  made another great speech of vindication and attack.  After sketching  the history of the Kansas-Nebraska struggle, from the introduction by  himself of the Nebraska Bill in the United States Senate, in 1854, down  to the passage of the \"English\" Bill--which prescribed substantially  that if the people of Kansas would come in as a Slave-holding State,  they should be admitted with but 35,000 inhabitants; but if they would  come in as a Free State, they must have 93,420 inhabitants; which unfair  restriction was opposed by Judge Douglas, but to which after it became  law he \"bowed in deference,\" because whatever decision the people of  Kansas might make on the coming third of August would be \"final and  conclusive of the whole question\"--he proceeded to compliment the  Republicans in Congress, for supporting the Crittenden-Montgomery Bill  --for coming \"to the Douglas platform, abandoning their own, believing  (in the language of the New York Tribune), that under the peculiar  circumstances they would in that mode best subserve the interests of the  Country;\" and then again attacked Mr. Lincoln for his \"unholy and  unnatural alliance\" with the Lecompton-Democrats to defeat him, because  of which, said he: \"You will find he does not say a word against the  Lecompton Constitution or its supporters.  He is as silent as the grave  upon that subject.  Behold Mr. Lincoln courting Lecompton votes, in  order that he may go to the Senate as the representative of Republican  principles!  You know that the alliance exists.  I think you will find  that it will ooze out before the contest is over.\"  Then with many  handsome compliments to the personal character of Mr. Lincoln, and  declaring that the question for decision was \"whether his principles are  more in accordance with the genius of our free institutions, the peace  and harmony of the Republic\" than those advocated by himself, Judge  Douglas"]]]
