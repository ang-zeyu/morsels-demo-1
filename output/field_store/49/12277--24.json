I could simply close  the door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it.  But that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to  me to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or  even that they might be punished, I would never have named them in the  first place as they are not the ones I hold responsible.  It's the  organisation that's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame.\"  \"That's how it is!\" shouted the policemen, who then immediately received  another blow on their backs, which were by now exposed.  \"If you had a  senior judge here beneath your stick,\" said K., pressing down the cane  as he spoke to stop it being raised once more, \"I really would do  nothing to stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give  you all the more strength.\"  \"Yeah, that's all very plausible, what  you're saying there,\" said the whip-man, \"only I'm not the sort of  person you can bribe.  It's my job to flog people, so I flog them.\"  Franz, the policeman, had been fairly quiet so far, probably in  expectation of a good result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped  forward to the door wearing just his trousers, kneeled down hanging on  to K.'s arm and whispered, \"Even if you can't get mercy shown for both  of us, at least try and get me set free.  Willem is older than me, he's  less sensitive than me in every way, he even got a light beating a  couple of years ago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the  way I did because Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for  good and bad.  Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me  at the entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful.\"  His face was  flowing over with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat.  \"I'm not  going to wait any longer,\" said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in  both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner  and looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head.  Then, the  sudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it  seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was  being tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard  by everyone in the building.  \"Don't shout like that!\", called out K.,  unable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction  from which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but  hard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with  his hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still  found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down  while he rolled to and fro under its blows.  And now one of the  servitors appeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him.  K. had quickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows  overlooking the yard and opened it.  The screams had completely stopped.  So that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, \"It's only me!\"  \"Good evening, chief clerk,\" somebody called back.  \"Is there anything  wrong?\"  \"No, no,\" answered K., \"it's only a dog yelping in the yard.\"  There was no sound from the servitors so he added, \"You can go back to  what you were doing.\"  He did not want to become involved with a  conversation with them, and so he leant out of the window.  A little  while later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone.  Now, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk  room, and he did not want to go home either.  The yard he looked down  into was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the  windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection  of the moon.  K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the  yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt  anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was  not his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that - clearly it must  have caused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control  of oneself at important moments - if Franz had not screamed then it was  at least highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the  whip-man.  If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the  whip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception,  and K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the  banknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to  raise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous,  he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now  begun to do something against  the degeneracy of the court then it was a  matter of course that he would have to do something here as well.  But  of course, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz  started screaming.  K. could not possibly have let the junior bank  staff, and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch  him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room.  Nobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him.  If that had  been his intention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have  taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the  policemen's place.  The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this  substitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his  duty without gaining any benefit.  He would most likely have violated  his duty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not  to cause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may  have been special conditions in force here.  However things stood, K.  was able to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would  still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced.  It was regrettable  that he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the  heat of the moment.            In the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not  want them to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and  walked towards the main staircase.  At the door of the junk room he  stopped and listened for a little while.  All was silent.  The two  policemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten  them to death.  K. reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it  suddenly back.  He was no longer in any position to help anyone, and the  servitors would soon be back;  he did, though, promise himself that he  would raise the matter again with somebody and see that, as far as it  was in his power, those who really were guilty, the high officials whom  nobody had so far dared point out to him, received their due punishment.  As he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank,  he looked  carefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be  seen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some  distance from the bank.  Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for  him was thus shown to be a lie, albeit one that was forgivable and  intended only to elicit more sympathy.            The policemen were still on K.'s mind all through the following  day; he was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his  office a little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it.  On the way home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door  as if that had been his habit.  Instead of the darkness he expected, he  saw everything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how  he should respond.  Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it  when he had opened the door the previous evening.   The forms and  bottles of ink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the  two policemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two  policemen began to wail and call out \"Mr. K.!\"  K. slammed the door  immediately shut, and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would  shut it all the firmer.  Almost in tears, he ran to the servitors  working quietly at the copying machine.  \"Go and get that junk room  cleared out!\" he shouted, and, in amazement, they stopped what they were  doing. \"It should have been done long ago, we're sinking in dirt!\"  They  would be able to do the job the next day, K. nodded, it was too late in  the evening to make them do it there and then as he had originally  intended.  He sat down briefly in order to keep them near him for a  little longer, looked through a few of the copies to give the impression  that he was checking them and then, as he saw that they would not dare  to leave at the same time as himself, went home tired and with his mind  numb.          Chapter Six  K.'s uncle - Leni            One afternoon - K. was very busy at the time, getting the post  ready - K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room,  pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some  papers.   K. had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him  now shocked K. far less than the prospect of it had done a long time  before.  His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about  a month.  He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle  would arrive, slightly bowed, his battered panama hat in his left hand,  his right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was  close enough as he rushed carelessly towards K. knocking over everything  that was in his way.  K.'s uncle was always in a hurry, as he suffered  from the unfortunate belief that he had a number things to do while he  was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day - his  visits were only ever for one day - and at the same time thought he  could not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that  might arise by chance.

But his worship, the Provost, knows  that they can change their complexions as easily as their jerkins, so  that I am still minded he was the same.\"    \"It is enough that you have seen him intermeddle with the course of the  King's justice, by attempting to recover an executed traitor,\" said the  officer.--\"Trois Eschelles and Petit Andre, dispatch.\"    \"Stay, signior officer!\" exclaimed the youth in mortal agony; \"hear me  speak--let me not die guiltlessly--my blood will be required of you by  my countrymen in this world, and by Heaven's justice in that which is to  follow.\"    \"I will answer for my actions in both,\" said the Provost, coldly, and  made a sign with his left hand to the executioners; then, with a smile  of triumphant malice, touched with his forefinger his right arm, which  hung suspended in a scarf, disabled probably by the blow which Durward  had dealt him that morning.    \"Miserable, vindictive wretch!\" answered Quentin, persuaded by that  action that private revenge was the sole motive of this man's rigour,  and that no mercy whatever was to be expected from him.    \"The poor youth raves,\" said the functionary: \"speak a word of comfort  to him ere he make his transit, Trois Eschelles; thou art a comfortable  man in such cases when a confessor is not to be had. Give him one minute  of ghostly advice, and dispatch matters in the next. I must proceed on  the rounds.--Soldiers, follow me!\"    The Provost rode on, followed by his guard, excepting two or three, who  were left to assist in the execution. The unhappy youth cast after him  an eye almost darkened by despair, and thought he heard in every tramp  of his horse's retreating hoofs the last slight chance of his safety  vanish. He looked around him in agony, and was surprised, even in that  moment, to see the stoical indifference of his fellow prisoners. They  had previously testified every sign of fear, and made every effort of  escape; but now, when secured and destined apparently to inevitable  death, they awaited its arrival with the utmost composure. The scene  of fate before them gave, perhaps, a more yellow tinge to their swarthy  cheeks; but it neither agitated their features, nor quenched the  stubborn haughtiness of their eye. They seemed like foxes, which, after  all their wiles and artful attempts at escape are exhausted, die with a  silent and sullen fortitude which wolves and bears, the fiercer objects  of the chase, do not exhibit. They were undaunted by the conduct of the  fatal executioners, who went about their work with more deliberation  than their master had recommended, and which probably arose from their  having acquired by habit a sort of pleasure in the discharge of their  horrid office. We pause an instant to describe them, because, under  a tyranny, whether despotic or popular, the character of the hangman  becomes a subject of grave importance.    These functionaries were essentially different in their appearance and  manners. Louis used to call them Democritus and Heraclitus, and their  master, the Provost, termed them Jean qui pleure and Jean qui rit.    [Democritus and Heraclitus: two Greek philosophers of the fifth century;  the former because of his propensity to laugh at the follies of men was  called the \"laughing philosopher;\" the latter, according to a current  notion, probably unfounded, habitually wept over the follies of mankind]    [Jean qui pleure, and Jean qui rit: John who weeps and John who laughs.  One of these two persons,.. might with more accuracy have been called  Petit Jean, than Petit Andre. This was actually the name of the son of  Henry de Cousin, master executioner of the High Court of Justice. S.]    Trois Eschelles was a tall, thin, ghastly man, with a peculiar gravity  of visage, and a large rosary round his neck, the use of which he was  accustomed piously to offer to those sufferers on whom he did his  duty. He had one or two Latin texts continually in his mouth on the  nothingness and vanity of human life; and, had it been regular to have  enjoyed such a plurality, he might have held the office of confessor  to the jail in commendam with that of executioner. Petit Andre, on the  contrary, was a joyous looking, round, active, little fellow, who  rolled about in execution of his duty as if it were the most diverting  occupation in the world. He seemed to have a sort of fond affection for  his victims, and always spoke of them in kindly and affectionate terms.  They were his poor honest fellows, his pretty dears, his gossips, his  good old fathers, as their age or sex might be; and as Trois Eschelles  endeavoured to inspire them with a philosophical or religious regard to  futurity, Petit Andre seldom failed to refresh them with a jest or two,  as if to induce them to pass from life as something that was ludicrous,  contemptible, and not worthy of serious consideration.    I cannot tell why or wherefore it was, but these two excellent persons,  notwithstanding the variety of their talents, and the rare occurrence of  such among persons of their profession, were both more utterly detested  than perhaps any creatures of their kind, whether before or since; and  the only doubt of those who knew aught of them was, whether the grave  and pathetic Trois Eschelles or the frisky, comic, alert Petit Andre  was the object of the greatest fear, or of the deepest execration. It  is certain they bore the palm in both particulars over every hangman  in France, unless it were perhaps their master Tristan l'Hermite, the  renowned Provost Marshal, or his master, Louis XI.    It must not be supposed that these reflections were of Quentin Durward's  making. Life, death, time, and eternity were swimming before his eyes--a  stunning and overwhelming prospect, from which human nature recoiled in  its weakness, though human pride would fain have borne up. He addressed  himself to the God of his fathers; and when he did so, the little rude  and unroofed chapel, which now held almost all his race but himself,  rushed on his recollection.    \"Our feudal enemies gave my kindred graves in our own land,\" he thought,  \"but I must feed the ravens and kites of a foreign land, like an  excommunicated felon!\"    The tears gushed involuntarily from his eyes. Trois Eschelles, touching  one shoulder, gravely congratulated him on his heavenly disposition  for death, and pathetically exclaiming, Beati qui in Domino moriuntur  [blessed are they who die in the Lord], remarked, the soul was happy  that left the body while the tear was in the eye. Petit Andre, slapping  the other shoulder, called out, \"Courage, my fair son! since you must  begin the dance, let the ball open gaily, for all the rebecs are in  tune,\" twitching the halter at the same time, to give point to his joke.  As the youth turned his dismayed looks, first on one and then on the  other, they made their meaning plainer by gently urging him forward to  the fatal tree, and bidding him be of good courage, for it would be over  in a moment.    In this fatal predicament, the youth cast a distracted look around him.  \"Is there any good Christian who hears me,\" he said, \"that will tell  Ludovic Lesly of the Scottish Guard, called in this country Le Balafre,  that his nephew is here basely murdered?\" The words were spoken in good  time, for an Archer of the Scottish Guard, attracted by the preparations  for the execution, was standing by, with one or two other chance  passengers, to witness what was passing.    \"Take heed what you do,\" he said to the executioners, \"if this young man  be of Scottish birth, I will not permit him to have foul play.\"    \"Heaven forbid, Sir Cavalier,\" said Trois Eschelles; \"but we must obey  our orders,\" drawing Durward forward by one arm. \"The shortest play is  ever the fairest,\" said Petit Andre, pulling him onward by the other.    But Quentin had heard words of comfort, and, exerting his strength, he  suddenly shook off both the finishers of the law, and, with his arms  still bound, ran to the Scottish Archer. \"Stand by me, countryman,\" he  said, in his own language, \"for the love of Scotland and Saint Andrew!  I am innocent--I am your own native landsman. Stand by me, as you shall  answer at the last day.\"    \"By Saint Andrew! they shall make at you through me!\" said the Archer,  and unsheathed his sword.    \"Cut my bonds, countryman,\" said Quentin, \"and I will do something for  myself.\"    This was done with a touch of the Archer's weapon, and the liberated  captive, springing suddenly on one of the Provost's guard, wrested from  him a halbert with which he was armed. \"And now\" he said, \"come on, if  you dare.\"    The two officers whispered together.    \"Ride thou after the Provost Marshal,\" said Trois Eschelles, \"and I will  detain them here, if I can. Soldiers of the Provost's guard, stand to  your arms.\"    Petit Andre mounted his horse, and left the field, and the other  Marshals men in attendance drew together so hastily at the command of  Trois Eschelles, that they suffered the other two prisoners to make  their escape during the confusion. Perhaps they were not very anxious  to detain them; for they had of late been sated with the blood of  such wretches, and, like other ferocious animals, were, through long  slaughter, become tired of carnage. But the pretext was, that they  thought themselves immediately called upon to attend to the safety of  Trois Eschelles; for there was a jealousy, which occasionally led to  open quarrels, betwixt the Scottish Archers and the Marshal guards, who  executed the orders of their Provost.    \"We are strong enough to beat the proud Scots twice over, if it be your  pleasure,\" said one of these soldiers to Trois Eschelles.    But that cautious official made a sign to him to remain quiet, and  addressed the Scottish Archer with great civility. \"Surely, sir, this  is a great insult to the Provost Marshal, that you should presume to  interfere with the course of the King's justice, duly and "]]]
