The greatest difficulty was to maintain the Eagles; a storm  of darts made it impossible to advance them, and the rotten ground  impossible to fix them. Caecina, while he sustained the fight, had his  horse shot, and having fallen was nigh taken; but the first legion  saved him. Our relief came from the greediness of the enemy, who ceased  slaying to seize the spoil: hence the legions had respite to struggle  into the fair field and firm ground. Nor was here an end of their  miseries: a palisade was to be raised, an entrenchment digged; their  instruments too for throwing up and carrying earth, and their tools  for cutting turf, were almost all lost; no tents for the soldiers; no  remedies for the wounded; and their food all defiled with mire or blood.  As they shared it in sadness amongst them, they lamented that mournful  night, they lamented the approaching day, to so many thousand men the  last.    It happened that a horse, which had broke his collar as he strayed  about, became frightened with noise, and ran over some that were in his  way: this raised such a consternation in the camp, from a persuasion  that the Germans in a body had forced an entrance, that all rushed to  the gates, especially to the postern, as the farthest from the foe, and  safer for flight. Caecina having found the vanity of their dread, but  unable to stop them, either by his authority, or by his prayers, or  indeed by force, flung himself at last across the gate. This prevailed;  their awe and tenderness of their General restrained them from running  over his body; and the Tribunes and Centurions satisfied them the while,  that it was a false alarm.    Then calling them together, and desiring them to hear him with silence,  he reminded them of their difficulties, and how to conquer them: \"That  for their lives they must be indebted to their arms, but force was to  be tempered with art; they must therefore keep close within their camp,  till the enemy, in hopes of taking it by storm, advanced; then make a  sudden sally on every side, and by this push they should break through  the enemy, and reach the Rhine. But if they fled, more forests remained  to be traversed, deeper marshes to be passed, and the cruelty of a  pursuing foe to be sustained.\" He laid before them the motives and  fruits of victory, public rewards and glory, with every tender domestic  consideration, as well as those of military exploits and praise. Of  their dangers and sufferings he said nothing. He next distributed  horses, first his own, then those of the Tribunes and leaders of the  legions, to the bravest soldiers impartially; that thus mounted they  might begin the charge, followed by the foot.    Amongst the Germans there was not less agitation, from hopes of victory,  greediness of spoil, and the opposite counsels of their leaders.  Arminius proposed \"to let the Romans march off, and to beset them  in their march, when engaged in bogs and fastnesses.\" The advice of  Inguiomerus was fiercer, and thence by the Barbarians more applauded:  he declared \"for forcing the camp, for that the victory would be quick,  there would be more captives, and entire plunder.\" As soon, therefore,  as it was light, they rushed out upon the camp, cast hurdles into  the ditch, attacked and grappled the palisade. Upon it few soldiers  appeared, and these seemed frozen with fear; but as the enemy was in  swarms, climbing the ramparts, the signal was given to the cohorts;  the cornets and trumpets sounded, and instantly, with shouts and  impetuosity, they issued out and begirt the assailants. \"Here are no  thickets,\" they scornfully cried; \"no bogs; but an equal field and  impartial Gods.\" The enemy, who imagined few Romans remaining, fewer  arms, and an easy conquest, were struck with the sounding trumpets, with  the glittering armour; and every object of terror appeared double to  them who expected none. They fell like men who, as they are void of  moderation in prosperity, are also destitute of conduct in distress.  Arminius forsook the fight unhurt; Inguiomerus grievously wounded; their  men were slaughtered as long as day and rage lasted. In the evening the  legions returned, in the same want of provisions, and with more wounds;  but in victory they found all things, health, vigour, and abundance.    In the meantime a report had flown, that the Roman forces were routed,  and an army of Germans upon full march to invade Gaul; so that under  the terror of this news there were those whose cowardice would have  emboldened them to have demolished the bridge upon the Rhine, had not  Agrippina restrained them from that infamous attempt. In truth, such was  the undaunted spirit of the woman, that at this time she performed all  the duties of a general, relieved the necessitous soldiers, upon the  wounded bestowed medicines, and upon others clothes. Caius Plinius,  the writer of the German wars, relates that she stood at the end of  the bridge, as the legions returned, and accosted them with thanks and  praises; a behaviour which sunk deep into the spirit of Tiberius: \"For  that all this officiousness of hers,\" he thought, \"could not be upright;  nor that it was against foreigners only she engaged the army. To the  direction of the generals nothing was now left, when a woman reviewed  the companies, attended the Eagles, and to the men distributed  largesses: as if before she had shown but small tokens of ambitious  designs, in carrying her child (the son of the General) in a soldier's  coat about the camp, with the title of Caesar Caligula: already in  greater credit with the army was Agrippina than the leaders of the  legions, in greater than their generals; and a woman had suppressed  sedition, which the authority of the Emperor was not able to restrain.\"  These jealousies were inflamed, and more were added, by Sejanus; one who  was well skilled in the temper of Tiberius, and purposely furnished him  with sources of hatred, to lie hid in his heart, and be discharged with  increase hereafter. Germanicus, in order to lighten the ships in which  he had embarked his men, and fit their burden to the ebbs and shallows,  delivered the second and fourteenth legions to Publius Vitellius, to  lead them by land. Vitellius at first had an easy march on dry ground,  or ground moderately overflowed by the tide, when suddenly the fury of  the north wind swelling the ocean (a constant effect of the equinox) the  legions were surrounded and tossed with the tide, and the land was all  on flood; the sea, the shore, the fields, had the same tempestuous face;  no distinction of depths from shallows; none of firm, from deceitful,  footing. They were overturned by the billows, swallowed down by the  eddies; and horses, baggage, and drowned men encountered each other,  and floated together. The several companies were mixed at random by  the waves; they waded, now breast high, now up to the chin, and as the  ground failed them, they fell, some never more to rise. Their cries and  mutual encouragements availed them nothing against the prevailing and  inexorable waves; no difference between the coward and the brave, the  wise and the foolish; none between circumspection and chance; but  all were equally involved in the invincible violence of the flood.  Vitellius, at length struggling on to an eminence, drew the legions  thither, where they passed the cold night without fire, and destitute of  every convenience; most of them naked or lamed; not less miserable than  men enclosed by an enemy; for even to such remained the consolation of  an honourable death; but here was destruction every way void of glory.  The land returned with the day, and they marched to the river Vidrus,  [Footnote: Weser.] whither Germanicus had gone with the fleet. There the  two legions were again embarked, when fame had given them for drowned;  nor was their escape believed till Germanicus and the army were seen to  return.    Stertinius, who in the meanwhile had been sent before to receive  Sigimerus, the brother of Segestes (a prince willing to surrender  himself) brought him and his son to the city of the Ubians. Both were  pardoned; the father freely, the son with more difficulty, because he  was said to have insulted the corpse of Varus. For the rest, Spain,  Italy, and both the Gauls strove with emulation to supply the losses of  the army; and offered arms, horses, money, according as each abounded.  Germanicus applauded their zeal; but accepted only the horses and  arms for the service of the war. With his own money he relieved the  necessities of the soldiers: and to soften also by his kindness the  memory of the late havoc, he visited the wounded, extolled the exploits  of particulars, viewed their wounds, with hopes encouraged some, with  a sense of glory animated others; and by affability and tenderness  confirmed them all in devotion to himself and to his fortune in war.    The ornaments of triumph were this year decreed to Aulus Caecina, Lucius  Apronius, and Caius Silius, for their services under Germanicus. The  title of Father of his Country, so often offered by the people to  Tiberius, was rejected by him; nor would he permit swearing upon his  acts, though the same was voted by the Senate. Against it he urged \"the  instability of all mortal things, and that the higher he was raised  the more slippery he stood.\" But for all this ostentation of a popular  spirit, he acquired not the reputation of possessing it, for he had  revived the law concerning violated majesty; a law which, in the days  of our ancestors, had indeed the same name, but implied different  arraignments and crimes, namely, those against the State;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#18)"],[1,"even when clearly better than the old.

PHYSICAL EUROPE    EUROPE A PENINSULA OF ASIA    The continent of Asia, projecting its huge bulk southwestward between the  seas, gradually narrows into the smaller continent of Europe. The boundary  between the two regions is not well defined. Ancient geographers found a  convenient dividing line north of the Black Sea in the course of the river  Don. Modern map makers usually place the division at the Ural Mountains,  the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus. Each of these boundaries is more or  less arbitrary. In a geographical sense Europe is only the largest of the  great Asiatic peninsulas.    PHYSICAL FEATURES OF EUROPE    But in physical features the two continents disclose the most striking  contrasts. The sea, which washes only the remote edges of Asia, penetrates  deeply into Europe and forms an extremely irregular coast line with  numerous bays and harbors. The mountains of Europe, seldom very high and  provided with easy passes, present no such barriers to intercourse as the  mightier ranges of Asia. We miss in Europe the extensive deserts and  barren table-lands which form such a feature of Asiatic geography. With  the exception of Russia the surface, generally, is distributed into  plains, hills, and valleys of moderate size. Instead of a few large  rivers, such as are found in Asia, Europe is well supplied with numerous  streams that make it possible to travel readily from one district to  another.    CENTRAL AND NORTHERN EUROPE    The almost unbroken mountain chain formed by the Pyrenees, the Alps, and  the Balkans, sharply separates the central land mass of Europe from the  regions to the south. Central Europe consists, in general, of lowlands,  which widen eastward into the vast Russian plain. Northern Europe includes  the British Isles, physically an extension of Europe, and the peninsulas  of Scandinavia and Finland, between the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean.  Twenty centuries ago central and northern Europe was a land of forests and  marshes, of desolate steppes and icebound hills. The peoples who inhabited  it--Celts in the west, Teutons or Germans in the north, Slavs in the east  --were men of Indo-European [2] race and speech. They were still  barbarians. During ancient times we hear little of them, except as their  occasional migrations southward brought them into contact with the Greeks  and the Romans.    SOUTHERN EUROPE    Southern Europe comprises the three peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the  Balkans, which reach far south into the Mediterranean. This great inland  sea is divided into two parts near the center, where Africa and the island  of Sicily almost touch each other across a narrow strait. The eastern part  contains several minor seas, of which the one called the Aegean had most  importance in Greek history.      21. GREECE AND THE AEGEAN    THE AEGEAN SEA    The Aegean is an almost landlocked body of water. The Balkan peninsula,  narrowing toward the Mediterranean into the smaller peninsula of Greece,  confines it on the west. On the east it meets a boundary in Asia Minor.  The southern boundary is formed by a chain of islands, while the only  opening northward is found in the narrow passage leading to the Black Sea.  The coasts and islands of the Aegean thus make up a little world set off  by itself.    [Illustration: Map, PHYSICAL MAP OF EUROPE]    CONTINENTAL GREECE    Continental Greece is a tiny country. Its greatest length is scarcely more  than two hundred and fifty miles; its greatest breadth is only one hundred  and eighty miles. Mountain ridges, offshoots of the Balkans, compose the  greater part of its area. Into the valleys and deep gorges of the interior  the impetuous sea has everywhere forced a channel. The coast line,  accordingly, is most irregular--a constant succession of sharp  promontories and curving bays. The mountains, crossing the peninsula in  confused masses, break it up into numberless valleys and glens which  seldom widen into plains. The rivers are not navigable. The few lakes,  hemmed in by the hills, have no outlets except in underground channels. In  this land of the Greeks no place is more than fifty miles from a mountain  range, or more than forty miles from some long arm of the Mediterranean.    THE AEGEAN ISLANDS    From the Greek mainland to the coast of Asia Minor the traveler follows a  route thickly studded with rocky islands. They are near enough together to  permit the passage from one to another without losing sight of land. The  Aegean islands thus served as \"stepping-stones\" between Greece and Asia  Minor. [3]    WESTERN ASIA MINOR    Western Asia Minor resembles Continental Greece in its deeply indented  coast, variety of scenery, and mild climate. The fertile river valleys of  this region early attracted Greek colonists. They built here many  flourishing cities, especially along the central coast, which came to be  known as Ionia.    INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS    Greek history well illustrates the influence of geographical conditions on  the life of a people. In the first place, mountain ranges cut up  Continental Greece into many small states, separated from one another by  natural ramparts. Hence the Greeks loved most of all their own local  independence and always refused to unite into one nation under a single  government. In the second place, the near presence of the sea made sailors  of the Greeks and led them to devote much energy to foreign commerce. They  early felt, in consequence, the stimulating effects of intercourse with  other peoples. Finally, the location of Greece at the threshold of Asia,  with its best harbors and most numerous islands on the eastern coast,  enabled the country to receive and profit by all the culture of the  Orient. Greece faced the civilized East.      22. THE AEGEAN AGE (TO ABOUT 1100 B.C.)    A PREHISTORIC"]]]
