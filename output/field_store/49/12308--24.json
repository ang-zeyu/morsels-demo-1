And when the words were ended, not unlike  To iron in the furnace, every cirque  Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires:  And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,  In number did outmillion the account  Reduplicate upon the chequer'd board.  Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,  \"Hosanna,\" to the fixed point, that holds,  And shall for ever hold them to their place,  From everlasting, irremovable.    Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw  by inward meditations, thus began:  \"In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,  Are seraphim and cherubim.  Thus swift  Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,  Near as they can, approaching; and they can  The more, the loftier their vision.

All, as they circle in their orders, look  Aloft, and downward with such sway prevail,  That all with mutual impulse tend to God.  These once a mortal view beheld.  Desire  In Dionysius so intently wrought,  That he, as I have done rang'd them; and nam'd  Their orders, marshal'd in his thought.  From him  Dissentient, one refus'd his sacred read.  But soon as in this heav'n his doubting eyes  Were open'd, Gregory at his error smil'd  Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth  Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt  Both this and much beside of these our orbs,  From an eye-witness to heav'n's mysteries.\"          CANTO XXIX    No longer than what time Latona's twins  Cover'd of Libra and the fleecy star,  Together both, girding the' horizon hang,  In even balance from the zenith pois'd,  Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,  Part the nice level; e'en so brief a space  Did Beatrice's silence hold.  A smile  Bat painted on her cheek; and her fix'd gaze  Bent on the point, at which my vision fail'd:  When thus her words resuming she began:  \"I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;  For I have mark'd it, where all time and place  Are present.  Not for increase to himself  Of good, which may not be increas'd, but forth  To manifest his glory by its beams,  Inhabiting his own eternity,  Beyond time's limit or what bound soe'er  To circumscribe his being, as he will'd,  Into new natures, like unto himself,  Eternal Love unfolded.  Nor before,  As if in dull inaction torpid lay.  For not in process of before or aft  Upon these waters mov'd the Spirit of God.  Simple and mix'd, both form and substance, forth  To perfect being started, like three darts  Shot from a bow three-corded.  And as ray  In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,  E'en at the moment of its issuing; thus  Did, from th' eternal Sovran, beam entire  His threefold operation, at one act  Produc'd coeval.  Yet in order each  Created his due station knew: those highest,  Who pure intelligence were made: mere power  The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,  Intelligence and power, unsever'd bond.  Long tract of ages by the angels past,  Ere the creating of another world,  Describ'd on Jerome's pages thou hast seen.  But that what I disclose to thee is true,  Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov'd  In many a passage of their sacred book  Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find  And reason in some sort discerns the same,  Who scarce would grant the heav'nly ministers  Of their perfection void, so long a space.  Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,  Thou know'st, and how: and knowing hast allay'd  Thy thirst, which from the triple question rose.  Ere one had reckon'd twenty, e'en so soon  Part of the angels fell: and in their fall  Confusion to your elements ensued.  The others kept their station: and this task,  Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,  That they surcease not ever, day nor night,  Their circling.  Of that fatal lapse the cause  Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen  Pent with the world's incumbrance.  Those, whom here  Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves  Of his free bounty, who had made them apt  For ministries so high: therefore their views  Were by enlight'ning grace and their own merit  Exalted; so that in their will confirm'd  They stand, nor feel to fall.  For do not doubt,  But to receive the grace, which heav'n vouchsafes,  Is meritorious, even as the soul  With prompt affection welcometh the guest.  Now, without further help, if with good heed  My words thy mind have treasur'd, thou henceforth  This consistory round about mayst scan,  And gaze thy fill.  But since thou hast on earth  Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,  Canvas the' angelic nature, and dispute  Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;  Therefore, 't is well thou take from me the truth,  Pure and without disguise, which they below,  Equivocating, darken and perplex.    \"Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,  Rejoicing in the countenance of God,  Have held unceasingly their view, intent  Upon the glorious vision, from the which  Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change  Of newness with succession interrupts,  Remembrance there needs none to gather up  Divided thought and images remote    \"So that men, thus at variance with the truth  Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some  Of error; others well aware they err,  To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.  Each the known track of sage philosophy  Deserts, and has a byway of his own:  So much the restless eagerness to shine  And love of singularity prevail.  Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes  Heav'n's anger less, than when the book of God  Is forc'd to yield to man's authority,  Or from its straightness warp'd: no reck'ning made  What blood the sowing of it in the world  Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,  Who meekly clings to it.  The aim of all  Is how to shine: e'en they, whose office is  To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,  And pass their own inventions off instead.  One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan moon  Bent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sun  With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:  Another, how the light shrouded itself  Within its tabernacle, and left dark  The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew.  Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,  Bandied about more frequent, than the names  Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.  The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return  From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails  For their excuse, they do not see their harm?  Christ said not to his first conventicle,  'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'  But gave them truth to build on; and the sound  Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,  Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,  To aid them in their warfare for the faith.  The preacher now provides himself with store  Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack  Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl  Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:  Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while  Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,  They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.  Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,  That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad  The hands of holy promise, finds a throng  Of credulous fools beneath.  Saint Anthony  Fattens with this his swine, and others worse  Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,  Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare.    \"But (for we far have wander'd) let us seek  The forward path again; so as the way  Be shorten'd with the time.  No mortal tongue  Nor thought of man hath ever reach'd so far,  That of these natures he might count the tribes.  What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'd  With finite number infinite conceals.  The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,  With light supplies them in as many modes,  As there are splendours, that it shines on: each  According to the virtue it conceives,  Differing in love and sweet affection.

So well did he keep his secret, that even Dee, with  whom he lived so many years, appears never to have discovered it. Kelly,  with this character, was just the man to carry on any piece of roguery  for his own advantage, or to nurture the delusions of his master for the  same purpose. No sooner did Dee inform him of the visit he had received  from the glorious Uriel, than Kelly expressed such a fervour of belief  that Dee's heart glowed with delight. He set about consulting his  crystal forthwith, and on the 2nd of December 1581, the spirits  appeared, and held a very extraordinary discourse with Kelly, which  Dee took down in writing. The curious reader may see this farrago  of nonsense among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum. The later  consultations were published in a folio volume, in 1659, by Dr. Meric  Casaubon, under the title of \"A True and Faithful Relation of what  passed between Dr. John Dee and some Spirits; tending, had it succeeded,  to a general Alteration of most States and Kingdoms in the World.\"  [Lilly, the astrologer, in his Life written by himself, frequently tells  of prophecies delivered by the angels in a manner similar to the angels  of Dr. Dee. He says, \"The prophecies were not given vocally by the  angels, but by inspection of the crystal in types and figures, or by  apparition the circular way; where, at some distance, the angels appear,  representing by forms, shapes, and creatures what is demanded. It  is very rare, yea, even in our days,\" quoth that wiseacre, \"for any  operator or master to hear the angels speak articulately: when they do  speak, it is like the Irish, much in the throat!\"]    The fame of these wondrous colloquies soon spread over the country, and  even reached the Continent. Dee, at the same time, pretended to be in  possession of the elixir vitae, which he stated he had found among the  ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, in Somersetshire. People flocked from far  and near to his house at Mortlake to have their nativities cast, in  preference to visiting astrologers of less renown. They also longed  to see a man who, according to his own account, would never die.  Altogether, he carried on a very profitable trade, but spent so much  in drugs and metals to work out some peculiar process of transmutation,  that he never became rich.    About this time there came into England a wealthy polish nobleman, named  Albert Laski, Count Palatine of Siradz. His object was principally, he  said, to visit the court of Queen Elizabeth, the fame of whose glory and  magnificence had reached him in distant Poland. Elizabeth received this  flattering stranger with the most splendid hospitality, and appointed  her favourite Leicester to show him all that was worth seeing in  England. He visited all the curiosities of London and Westminster, and  from thence proceeded to Oxford and Cambridge, that he might converse  with some of the great scholars whose writings shed lustre upon the land  of their birth. He was very much disappointed at not finding Dr. Dee  among them, and told the Earl of Leicester that he would not have gone  to Oxford if he had known that Dee was not there. The Earl promised to  introduce him to the great alchymist on their return to London, and the  Pole was satisfied. A few days afterwards, the Earl and Laski being in  the antechamber of the Queen, awaiting an audience of her Majesty, Dr.  Dee arrived on the same errand, and was introduced to the Pole. [Albert  Laski, son of Jaroslav, was Palatine of Siradz, and afterwards of  Sendomir, and chiefly contributed to the election of Henry of Valois,  the Third of France, to the throne of Poland, and was one of the  delegates who went to France in order to announce to the new monarch his  elevation to the sovereignty of Poland. After the deposition of Henry,  Albert Laski voted for Maximilian of Austria. In 1585 he visited  England, when Queen Elizabeth received him with great distinction. The  honours which were shown him during his visit to Oxford, by the especial  command of the Queen, were equal to those rendered to sovereign princes.  His extraordinary prodigality rendered his enormous wealth insufficient  to defray his expenses, and he therefore became a zealous adept  in alchymy, and took from England to Poland with him two known  alchymists.--Count Valerian Krasinski's \"Historical Sketch of the  Reformation in Poland.\"] An interesting conversation ensued, which ended  by the stranger inviting himself to dine with the astrologer at his  house at Mortlake. Dee returned home in some tribulation, for he found  he had not money enough, without pawning his plate, to entertain Count  Laski and his retinue in a manner becoming their dignity. In this  emergency he sent off an express to the Earl of Leicester, stating  frankly the embarrassment he laboured under, and praying his good  offices in representing the matter to her Majesty. Elizabeth immediately  sent him a present of twenty pounds.    On the appointed day, Count Laski came, attended by a numerous retinue,  and expressed such open and warm admiration of the wonderful attainments  of his host, that Dee turned over, in his own mind, how he could bind  irretrievably to his interests a man who seemed so well inclined to  become his friend. Long acquaintance with Kelly had imbued him with  all the roguery of that personage; and he resolved to make the Pole pay  dearly for his dinner. He found out, before many days, that he possessed  great estates in his own country, as well as great influence; but that  an extravagant disposition had reduced him to temporary embarrassment.  He also discovered, that he was a firm believer in the philosopher's  stone and the water of life. He was, therefore, just the man upon whom  an adventurer might fasten himself. Kelly thought so too; and both of  them set to work, to weave a web, in the meshes of which they might  firmly entangle the rich and credulous stranger. They went very  cautiously about it; first throwing out obscure hints of the stone and  the elixir; and, finally, of the spirits, by means of whom they could  turn over the pages of the Book of Futurity, and read the awful secrets  inscribed therein. Laski eagerly implored that he might be admitted to  one of their mysterious interviews with Uriel and the angels; but they  knew human nature too well to accede at once to the request. To the  Count's entreaties they only replied by hints of the difficulty or  impropriety of summoning the spirits in the presence of a stranger; or  of one who might, perchance, have no other motive than the gratification  of a vain curiosity: but they only meant to whet the edge of his  appetite by this delay, and would have been sorry indeed if the Count  had been discouraged. To show how exclusively the thoughts both of Dee  and Kelly were fixed upon their dupe, at this time, it is only necessary  to read the introduction to their first interview with the spirits,  related in the volume of Dr. Casaubon. The entry made by Dee, under the  date of the 25th of May 1583, says, that when the spirit appeared to  them, \"I, [John Dee], and E. K. [Edward Kelly], sat together, conversing  of that noble Polonian Albertus Laski, his great honour here with us  obtained, and of his great liking among all sorts of the people.\" No  doubt they were discussing how they might make the most of the \"noble  Polonian,\" and concocting the fine story with which they afterwards  excited his curiosity, and drew him firmly within their toils.  \"Suddenly,\" says Dee, as they were thus employed, \"there seemed to come  out of the oratory, a spiritual creature, like a pretty girl, of seven  or nine years of age, attired on her head, with her hair rolled up  before, and hanging down behind; with a gown of silk, of changeable red  and green, and with a train. She seemed to play up and down, and seemed  to go in and out behind the books; and, as she seemed to go between  them, the books displaced themselves, and made way for her.\"    With such tales as these they lured on the Pole from day to day; and  at last persuaded him to be a witness of their mysteries. Whether they  played off any optical delusions upon him; or whether, by the force of a  strong imagination, he deluded himself, does not appear; but certain it  is, that he became a complete tool in their hands, and consented to do  whatever they wished him. Kelly, at these interviews, placed himself at  a certain distance from the wondrous crystal, and gazed intently upon  it; while Dee took his place in corner, ready to set down the prophecies  as they were uttered by the spirits. In this manner they prophesied  to the Pole, that he should become the fortunate possessor of the  philosopher's stone; that he should live for centuries, and be chosen  King of Poland; in which capacity he should gain many great victories  over the Saracens, and make his name illustrious over all the earth. For  this pose it was necessary, however, that Laski should leave England,  and take them with him, together with their wives and families; that he  should treat them all sumptuously, and allow them to want for nothing.  Laski at once consented; and very shortly afterwards they were all on  the road to Poland.    It took them upwards of four months to reach the Count's estates, in the  neighbourhood of Cracow. In the mean time, they led a pleasant life, and  spent money with an unsparing hand. When once established in the Count's  palace, they commenced the great hermetic operation of transmuting iron  into gold. Laski provided them with all necessary materials, and aided  them himself with his knowledge of"]]]
