This receipt will serve as a guide for preserved nectarines, peaches,  plums, gages, &c. A few of the kernels should always be put in with  the fruit, as they improve the flavor of the preserve.           *       *       *       *       *    STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED WHOLE.    Weigh an equal quantity of fruit and white sugar powdered, sift all  the sugar over the fruit, so that half of it shall equally be covered,  let it lay till the next day, when boil the remainder with red currant  juice, in which simmer the strawberries until the jelly hangs about  them. Put the strawberries into pots, taking care not to break them,  and pour over the syrup.    This receipt will serve for raspberries and cherries, which make a  fine preserve.           *       *       *       *       *    STRAWBERRY JAM.    Bruise gently, with the back of a wooden spoon, six pounds of fine  fresh fruit, and boil them with very little water for twenty minutes,  stirring until the fruit and juice are well mixed; then put in  powdered loaf sugar of equal weight to the fruit, and simmer half an  hour longer. If the preserve is not required to be very rich, half the  weight of sugar in proportion to the quantity of fruit may be used;  but more boiling will be requisite. By this recipe also are made  raspberry, currant, gooseberry, apricot, and other jams.           *       *       *       *       *    RED CURRANT JELLY.    Strip carefully from the stems some quite ripe currants, put them into  a preserving pan, stir them gently over a clear fire until the juice  flows freely from them, then squeeze the currants and strain the juice  through a folded muslin or jelly bag; pour it into a preserving pan,  adding, as it boils, white sugar, in the proportion of one pound of  sugar to one pint of juice.    If made with less sugar, more boiling will be required, by which much  juice and flavour are lost. A little dissolved isinglass is used by  confectioners, but it is much better without. Jams and jellies should  be poured into pots when in a boiling state.    Jellies should be continually skimmed till the scum ceases to rise,  so that they may be clear and fine. White currant jelly and black are  made in the same manner as red. By this receipt can be made raspberry  jelly, strawberry jelly, and all other kinds.           *       *       *       *       *    APPLE JELLY.    Pare, core, and cut small any kind of fine baking apples--say six  pounds in weight; put them in a preserving pan with one quart of  water; boil gently till the apples are very soft and broken, then pass  the juice through a jelly bag; when, to each pint, add half a pound of  loaf sugar, set it on the fire to boil twenty minutes, skimming it as  the scum rises; it must not be over boiled, or the colour will be too  dark.           *       *       *       *       *    PEAR-SYRUP OR JELLY.    This preparation, although little known in England, forms an important  article of economy in many parts of the Continent. The pears are first  heated in a saucepan over the fire until the pulp, skins, &c., have  separated from the juice, which is then strained, and boiled with  coarse brown sugar to the thickness of treacle; but it has a far  more agreeable flavour. It is cheaper than butter or treacle, and is  excellent spread upon bread for children.           *       *       *       *       *    PLUM JAM.    This is a useful and cheap preserve. Choose the large long black plum;  to each gallon of which add three pounds of good moist sugar; bake  them till they begin to crack, when, put them in pots, of a size for  once using, as the air is apt to spoil the jam.          CHAPTER IX.      Pickling.    The best vinegar should always be used for pickling; in all cases it  should be boiled and strained.    The articles to be pickled should first be parboiled or soaked in  brine, which should have about six ounces of salt to one quart of  water.    The spices used for pickling are whole pepper, long peppers, allspice,  mace, mustard-seed, and ginger, the last being first bruised.    The following is a good proportion of spice: to one quart of vinegar  put half an ounce of ginger, the same quantity of whole-pepper and  allspice, and one ounce of mustard-seed; four shalots, and one clove  of garlic.    Pickles should be kept secure from the air, or they soon become  soft; the least quantity of water, or a wet spoon, put into a jar of  pickles, will spoil the contents.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE GHERKINS AND FRENCH BEANS.    These are, of all vegetables, the most difficult to pickle, so that  their green colour and freshness may be preserved. Choose some fine  fresh gherkins, and set them to soak in brine for a week; then drain  them, and pour over boiling vinegar, prepared with the usual spices,  first having covered them with fresh vine leaves. If they do not  appear to be of a fine green, pour off the vinegar, boil it up again,  cover the gherkins with fresh green vine leaves, and pour over the  vinegar again. French beans are pickled exactly the same.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS.    Remove the stalks and leaves, break the flower into pieces, parboil  them in brine, then drain them, and lay them in a jar, and pour over  boiling spiced vinegar.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE MELON MANGOES.    Cut the melons in half, remove the pulpy part and the seeds, soak  the halves for a week in strong brine, then fill them with the  usual spices, mustard-seed and garlic, and tie them together with  packthread; put them in jars, and pour over boiling spiced vinegar.  Large cucumbers may be pickled in the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    PICCALILI.    Pickle gherkins, French beans, and cauliflower, separately, as already  directed; the other vegetables used are carrots, onions, capsicums,  white cabbage, celery, and, indeed almost any kind may be put into  this pickle, except walnuts and red cabbage. They must be cut in small  pieces, and soaked in brine, the carrots only, requiring to be boiled  in it to make them tender; then prepare a liquor as follows: into  half a gallon of vinegar put two ounces of ginger, one of whole black  pepper, one of whole allspice, and one of bruised chillies, three  ounces of shalots, and one ounce of garlic; boil together nearly  twenty minutes; mix a little of it in a basin, with two ounces of  flour of mustard and one ounce of turmeric, and stir it in gradually  with the rest; then pour the liquor over the vegetables.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS.    Choose small button mushrooms, clean and wipe them, and throw them  into cold water, then put into a stewpan with a little salt, and cover  them with distilled vinegar, and simmer a few minutes. Put them in  bottles with a couple of blades or so of mace, and when cold, cork  them closely.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE ONIONS.    Choose all of a size and soak in boiling brine, when cold, drain them  and put them in bottles, and fill up with hot distilled vinegar; if  they are to be _white_, use white wine vinegar; if they are to be  _brown_, use the best distilled vinegar, adding, in both cases, a  little mace, ginger, and whole pepper.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE WHITE AND RED CABBAGE.    Take off the outside leaves, cut out the stalk, and shred the cabbage  into a cullender, sprinkle with salt, let it remain for twenty-four  hours, then drain it. Put it into jars, and fill up with boiling  vinegar, prepared with the usual spices; if the cabbage is red, a  little cochineal powdered, or a slice or two of beet-root is necessary  to make the pickle a fine colour; if it is white cabbage, add instead,  a little turmeric powder.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE WALNUTS.    Soak in brine for a week, prick them, and simmer in brine, then let  them lay on a sieve to drain, and to turn black, after which place  them in jars, and pour over boiling spiced vinegar.           *       *       *       *       *    AN OLD WAY OF PICKLING CUCUMBERS.    Cut the cucumbers in small pieces, length ways, with the peel left  on; lay them in salt for twenty-four hours, then dry the pieces with  a cloth, lay them in a deep dish, and pour over the following mixture:  some vinegar boiled with cayenne pepper, whole ginger, a little  whole pepper, and mustard seed, a few West India pickles are by some  considered an improvement. This mixture should stand till nearly cold  before covering the cucumbers, which should then be bottled. This  pickle is fit for eating a few days after it is made, and will also  keep good in a dry place as long as may be required.          CHAPTER X.      Receipts for Invalids.    BEEF TEA.    Cut one pound of fleshy beef in dice, or thin slices, simmer for a  short time without water, to extract the juices, then add, by degrees,  one quart of water, a little salt, a piece of lemon peel, and a  sprig of parsley, are the only necessary seasonings; if the broth is  required to be stronger put less water.           *       *       *       *       *    CHICKEN PANADA.    Boil a chicken till rather more than half done in a quart of water,  take of the skin, cut off the white parts when cold, and pound it to  a paste in a mortar, with a small quantity of the liquor it was boiled  in, season with salt, a little nutmeg, and the least piece of lemon  peel; boil it gently, and make it with the liquor in which the fowl  has been boiled of the required consistency. It should be rather  thicker than cream.           *       *       *       *       *    CHICKEN BROTH.    After the white parts have been removed for the panada, return the  rest of the chicken to the saucepan, with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#19)"],[1,"tion--all these influence the body in this manner, the consequences  depending upon the intensity of the emotion and its protraction.  Chronic emotional stimulation, therefore, may fatigue or exhaust  the brain and may cause cardiovascular disease, indigestion, Graves'  disease, diabetes, and insanity even.    The effect of the emotions upon the body mechanism may be compared  to that produced upon the mechanism of an automobile if its engines  are kept running at full speed while the machine is stationary.  The whole machine will be shaken and weakened, the batteries and weakest  parts being the first to become impaired and destroyed, the length  of usefulness of the automobile being correspondingly limited.    We have shown that the effects upon the body mechanism of the action  of the various ceptors is in relation to the response made by the brain  to the stimuli received.  What is this power of response on the part  of the brain but CONSCIOUSNESS?  If this is so, then consciousness  itself is a reaction to environment, and its intensity must vary  with the state of the brain and with the environmental stimuli.  If the brain-cells are in the state of highest efficiency, if their  energy has not been drawn upon, then consciousness is at its height;  if the brain is fatigued, that is, if the energy stored in the cells  has been exhausted to any degree, then the intensity of consciousness  is diminished.  So degrees of consciousness vary from the height  maintained by cells in full vigor through the stages of fatigue  to sleep, to the deeper unconsciousness secured by the administration  of inhalation anesthetics, to that complete unconsciousness  of the environment which is secured by blocking the advent to  the brain of all impressions from both distance and contact ceptors,  by the use of both local and inhalation anesthetics--the state  of anoci-association (Fig. 14).    Animals and man may be so exhausted as to be only semi-conscious.  While a brain perfectly refreshed by a long sleep cannot immediately  sleep again, the exhausted brain and the refreshed brain when subjected  to equal stimuli will rise to unequal heights of consciousness.  The nature of the physical basis of consciousness has been  sought in experiments on rabbits which were kept awake from  one hundred to one hundred and nine hours.  At the end of this  time they were in a state of extreme exhaustion and seemed  semi-conscious. If the wakefulness had been further prolonged,  this state of semi-consciousness would have steadily changed  until it culminated in the permanent unconsciousness of death.  An examination of the brain-cells of these animals showed physical  changes identical with those produced by exhaustion from other causes,  such as prolonged physical exertion or emotional strain (Figs. 45  and 46). After one hundred hours of wakefulness the rabbits were  allowed a long period of sleep.  All the brain-cells were restored  except those that had been in a state of complete exhaustion.  A single seance of sleep served to restore some of the cells,  but those which had undergone extreme changes required prolonged rest.  These experiments give us a definite physical basis for explaining  the cost to the body mechanism of maintaining the conscious state.  We have stated that the brain-cell changes produced by prolonged  consciousness are identical with those produced by physical exertion  and by emotional strain.  Rest, then, and especially sleep,  is needed to restore the physical state of the brain-cells which  have been impaired, and as the brain-cells constitute the central  battery of the body mechanism, their restoration is essential  for the maintenance of normal vitality.    In ordinary parlance, by consciousness we mean the activity  of that part of the brain in which associative memory resides,  but while associative memory is suspended the activities of the brain  as a whole are by no means suspended; the respiratory and circulatory  centers are active, as are those centers which maintain muscular tone.  This is shown by the muscular response to external stimuli made  by the normal person in sleep; by the occasional activation of motor  patterns which may break through into consciousness causing dreams;  and finally by the responses of the motor mechanism made to the injuring  stimuli of an operation on a patient under inhalation anesthesia only.    Direct proof of the mechanistic action of many of life's phenomena  is lacking, but the proof is definite and final of the part  that the brain-cells play in maintaining consciousness;  of the fact that the degree of consciousness and mental  efficiency depends upon the physical state of the brain-cells;  and finally that efficiency may be restored by sleep,  provided that exhaustion of the cells has not progressed too far.  In this greatest phenomenon of life, then, the mechanistic theory  is in harmony with the facts.    Perhaps no more convincing proof of our thesis that the body is  a mechanism developed and adapted to its purposes by environment  can be secured than by a study of that most constant manifestation  of consciousness--pain.    Like the other phenomena of life, pain was undoubtedly evolved  for a particular purpose--surely for the good of the individual.  Like fear and worry, it frequently is injurious.  What then may  be its purpose?    We postulate that pain is a result of contact ceptor stimulation  for the purpose of securing protective muscular activity.  This postulate applies to all kinds of pain, whatever their cause--  whether physical injury, pyogenic infection, the obstruction  of hollow viscera, childbirth, etc.    All forms of pain are associated with muscular action, and as in every  other stimulation of the ceptors, each kind of pain is specific  to the causative stimuli.  The child puts his hand in the fire;  physical injury pain results, and the appropriate muscular  response is elicited.  If pressure is prolonged on some parts  of the body, anemia of the parts may result, with a corresponding  discomfort or pain, requiring muscular action for relief.  When the rays of the sun strike directly upon the retina, light pain  causes an immediate protective action, so too in the evacuation  of the intestine and the urinary bladder as normal acts, and in  overcoming obstruction of these tracts, discomfort or pain compel  the required muscular actions.  This view of pain as a stimulation  to motor action explains why only certain types of infection are  associated with pain; namely, those types in which the infection  may be spread by muscular action or those in which the fixation  of parts by continued muscular rigidity is an advantage.  As a further remarkable proof of the marvelous adaptation  of the body mechanism to meet varying environmental conditions,  we find that just as nociceptors have been implanted in only those  parts of the body which have been subject to nocuous contacts,  so a type of infection which causes muscular action in one part  of the body may cause none when it attacks another.    This postulate gives us the key to the pain-muscular phenomena  of peritonitis, pleurisy, cystitis, cholecystitis, etc., as well as to  the pain-muscular phenomena in obstructions of the hollow viscera.  If pain is a part of a muscular response and occurs only  as a result of contact ceptor stimulation by physical injury,  infection, anemia, or obstruction, we may well inquire which part  of the nerve mechanism is the site of the phenomenon of pain.  Is it the nerve-ending, the nerve-trunk, or the brain?  That is,  is pain associated with the physical contact with the nerve-ending,  or with the physical act of transmission along the nerve-trunk,  or with the change of brain-cell substance by means of which  the motor-producing energy is released?    We postulate that the pain is associated with the discharge of energy  from the brain-cells. If this be true, then if every nociceptor in  the body were equally stimulated in such a manner that all the stimuli  should reach the brain-cells simultaneously, then the cells would  find themselves in equilibrium and no motor act would be performed.  But if all the pain nerve ceptors but one were equally stimulated,  and this one more strongly stimulated than the rest, then this  one would gain possession of the final common path--would cause  a muscular action and the sensation of pain.    It is well known that when a greater pain or stimulus is thrown  into competition with a lesser one, the lesser is submerged.  Of this fact the school-boy makes use when he initiates  the novice into the mystery of the painless pulling of hair.  The simultaneous but severe application of the boot to the blindfolded  victim takes complete but exclusive possession of the final common  path and the hair is painlessly plucked as a result of the triumph  of the boot stimulus over the pull on the hair in the struggle  for the final common path.    Persons who have survived a sudden, complete exposure to superheated steam,  or whose bodies have been enwrapped in flame, testify that they  have felt no pain.  As this absence of pain may be due to the fact  that the emotion of fear gained the final common path, to the exclusion  of all other stimuli, we are trying by experimentation to discover  the effects of simultaneous painful stimulation of all parts of the body.  The data already in hand, and the experiments now in progress,  in which anesthetized animals are subjected to powerful stimuli  applied to certain parts of the body only, or simultaneously to  all parts of the body, lead us to believe that in the former case  the brain-cells become stimulated or hyperchromatic, while in the latter  case no brain-cell changes occur.  We believe that our experiments  will prove that an equal and simultaneous stimulation of all parts  of the body leaves the brain-cells in a state of equilibrium.  Our theory of pain will then be well"]]]
