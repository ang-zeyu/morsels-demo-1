Did I not tell you he was taking  time by the forelock when he brought the apples?\"    \"Oh, auntie, I am only asking questions because--\"    \"Yes, because, because, I understand perfectly. Because you are a girl,  and all the girls fall a victim to Harry's charms at once. If you don't  want to succumb meekly to your fate, 'Heed the spark or you may dread  the fire.' That is the only advice I can tender you.\"    This was a Thursday, and on the following Sunday Harold Beecham  reappeared at Caddagat and remained from three in the afternoon until  nine at night. Uncle Julius and Frank Hawden were absent. The weather  had taken a sudden backward lurch into winter again, so we had a fire.  Harold sat beside it all the time, and interposed yes and no at the  proper intervals in grannie's brisk business conversation, but he never  addressed one word to me beyond \"Good afternoon, Miss Melvyn,\" on his  arrival, and \"Good night, Miss Melvyn,\" when leaving.    I studied him attentively all the while. What were his ideas and  sentiments it were hard to tell: he never expressed any. He was  fearfully and wonderfully quiet. Yet his was an intelligent silence, not  of that wooden brainless description which casts a damper on company,  neither was it of the morose or dreaming order.          CHAPTER FOURTEEN    Principally Letters      Caddagat, 29th Sept., 1896    My dearest Gertie,    I have started to write no less than seven letters to you, but something  always interrupted me and I did not finish them. However, I'll finish  this one in the teeth of Father Peter himself. I will parenthesize all  the interruptions. (A traveller just asked me for a rose. I had to get  up and give him one.) Living here is lovely. (Another man inquired the  way to Somingley Gap, and I've just finished directing him.) Grannie is  terribly nice. You could not believe. She is always giving me something,  and takes me wherever she goes. Auntie is an angel. I wish you could  hear the piano. It is a beauty. There are dozens of papers and books to  read. Uncle is a dear old fellow. You should hear him rave and swear  sometimes when he gets in a rage. It is great fun. He brings me lollies,  gloves, ribbons, or something every time he comes from town. (Two Indian  hawkers have arrived, and I am going out to see their goods. There were  nineteen hawkers here last week. I am sitting on a squatter's chair and  writing on a table in the veranda, and the road goes right by the  flower-garden. That is how I see everyone.) Have you had rain down there  this week? They have great squawking about the drought up here. I wish  they could see Goulburn, and then they'd know what drought means. I  don't know what sort of a bobberie they would kick up. It's pretty dry  out on the run, but everyone calls the paddocks about the house an  oasis. You see there are such splendid facilities for irrigation here.  Uncle has put on a lot of men. They have cut races between the two  creeks between which the house is situated. Every now and again they let  the water from these over the orchard gardens and about a hundred acres  of paddock land around the house. The grass therein is up to the horses'  fetlocks. There is any amount of rhubarb and early vegetables in the  garden. Grannie says there is a splendid promise of fruit in the  orchard, and the flower-garden is a perfect dream. This is the dearest  old place in the world. Dozens of people plague grannie to be let put  their horses in the grass--especially shearers, there are droves of them  going home now--but she won't let them; wants all the grass for her own  stock. Uncle has had to put another man on to mind it, or at night all  the wires are cut and the horses put in. (An agent, I think by the cut  of him, is asking for grannie. I'll have to run and find her.) It is  very lively here. Never a night but we have the house full of agents or  travellers of one sort or another, and there are often a dozen swaggies  in the one day.    Harold Beecham is my favourite of all the men hereaway. He is  delightfully big and quiet. He isn't good-looking, but I like his face.  (Been attending to the demands of a couple of impudent swaggies. Being  off the road at Possum Gully, you escape them.) For the love of life,  next time you write, fire into the news at once and don't half-fill your  letter telling me about the pen and your bad writing. I am scribbling at  the rate of 365 miles an hour, and don't care a jot whether it is good  writing or not.    Auntie, uncle, Frank Hawden and I, are going to ride to Yabtree church  next Sunday. It is four miles beyond Five-Bob Downs, so that is sixteen  miles. It is the nearest church. I expect it will be rare fun. There  will be such a crowd coming home, and that always makes the horses  delightfully frisky. (A man wants to put his horses in the paddock for  the night, so I will have to find uncle.) I never saw such a place for  men. It is all men, men, men. You cannot go anywhere outside the house  but you see men coming and going in all directions. It wouldn't do to  undress without bothering to drop the window-blind like we used at  Possum Gully. Grannie and uncle say it is a curse to be living beside  the road, as it costs them a tremendous lot a year. There are seven  lemon-trees here, loaded (another hawker). I hope you think of me  sometimes. I am just as ugly as ever. (A traveller wants to buy a loaf  of bread.)    With stacks of love to all at home, and a whole dray-load for yourself,  from your loving sister,    Sybylla.      Remember me to Goulburn, drowsing lazily in its dreamy graceful hollow  in the blue distance.      Caddagat, 29th Sept., 1896    Dear Everard,    Thank you very much for the magazines and \"An Australian Bush Track\". I  suppose you have quite forgotten us and Caddagat by this time. The sun  has sunk behind the gum-trees, and the blue evening mists are hanging  lazily in the hollows of the hills. I expect you are donning your  \"swallow-tail\" preparatory to leading some be-satined \"faire ladye\" in  to a gorgeous dinner, thence to the play, then to a dance probably. No  doubt all around you is bustle, glare of lights, noise, and fun. It is  such a different scene here. From down the road comes the tinkle of  camp-bells and jingle of hobble-chains. From down in that sheltered  angle where the creek meets the river comes the gleam of camp-fires  through the gathering twilight, and I can see several tents rigged for  the night, looking like white specks in the distance.    I long for the time to come when I shall get to Sydney. I'm going to  lead you and aunt Helen a pretty dance. You'll have to keep going night  and day. It will be great. I must get up and dance a jig on the veranda  when I think of it. You'll have to show me everything--slums and all. I  want to find out the truth of heaps of things for myself.    Save for the weird rush of the stream and the kookaburras' good-night,  all is still, with a mighty far-reaching stillness which can be felt.  Now the curlews are beginning their wild moaning cry. From the rifts in  the dark lone ranges, far down the river, it comes like a hunted spirit  until it makes me feel--      At this point I said, \"Bah! I'm mad to write to Everard Grey like this.  He would laugh and call me a poor little fool.\" I tore the half-finished  letter to shreds, and consigned it to the kitchen fire. I substituted a  prim formal note, merely thanking him for the books and magazine he had  sent me. To this I never received an answer. I heard through his letters  to grannie that he was much occupied. Had been to Brisbane and Melbourne  on important cases, so very likely had not time to be bothered with me;  or, he might have been like the majority of his fellows who make a great  parade of friendship while with one, then go away and forget one's  existence in an hour.    While at Caddagat there were a few duties allotted to me. One of these  was to attend to the drawing-room; another was to find uncle Jay-Jay's  hat when he mislaid it--often ten times per day. I assisted my  grandmother to make up her accounts and write business letters, and I  attended to tramps. A man was never refused a bit to eat at Caddagat.  This necessitated the purchase of an extra ton of flour per year, also  nearly a ton of sugar, to say nothing of tea, potatoes, beef, and all  broken meats which went thus. This was not reckoning the consumption of  victuals by the other class of travellers with which the house was  generally full year in and year out. Had there been any charge for their  board and lodging, the Bossiers would surely have made a fortune. I  interviewed on an average fifty tramps a week, and seldom saw the same  man twice. What a great army they were! Hopeless, homeless, aimless,  shameless souls, tramping on from north to south, and east to west,  never relinquishing their heart-sickening, futile quest for work--some  of them so long on the tramp that the ambitions of manhood had been  ground out of them, and they wished for nothing more than this.    There were all shapes, sizes, ages, kinds, and conditions of men--the  shamefaced boy in the bud of his youth, showing by the way he begged  that the humiliation of the situation had not yet worn off, and poor old  creatures tottering on the brink of the grave, with nothing left in life  but the enjoyment of beer and tobacco. There were strong men in their  prime who really desired work when they asked for it, and skulking  cowards who hoped they would not get it. There were the diseased, the  educated, the ignorant, the deformed, the blind, the evil, the honest,  the mad, and the sane. Some in real professional beggars' style called  down blessings on me; others were morose and glum, while some were  impudent and thankless, and said to supply them with food was just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11647"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 458, October 11, 1884 (#19)"],[1," choleraic dejections  dried on covering glasses, stained with fuchsin or methyl-blue, and  examined with oil immersion, one-twelfth, and Abbe's condenser; also  sections of intestine preserved in absolute alcohol, and stained with  methyl-blue. There were also cultures in gelatin, etc.    [Footnote 1: A detailed report is published in the _Berliner Klinische  Wochenschrift_ Aug. 4.]    Dr. Koch commenced by remarking that what was required for the prevention  of cholera was a scientific basis. Many and diverse views as to its mode  of diffusion and infection prevailed, but they furnished no safe ground  for prophylaxis. On the one hand, it was held that cholera is a specific  disease originating in India; on the other, that it may arise  spontaneously in any country, and own no specific cause. One view regards  the infection to be conveyed only by the patient and his surroundings; and  the other that it is spread by merchandise, by healthy individuals, and by  atmospheric currents. There is a like discrepancy in the views on the  possibility of its diffusion by drinking water, on the influence of  conditions of soil, on the question whether the dejecta contain the poison  or not, and on the duration of the incubation period. No progress was  possible in combating the disease until these root questions of the  etiology of cholera are decided.    Hitherto the advances in knowledge upon the etiology of other infective  diseases have done little toward the etiology of cholera. These advances  have been made within the last ten years, during which time no  opportunity--at least not in Europe--has occurred to pursue researches;  and in India, where there is abundant material for such research, no one  has undertaken the task. The opportunity given by the outbreak of cholera  in Egypt last year to study the disease before it reached European soil  was taken advantage of by various governments, who sent expeditions for  the purpose. He had the honor to take part in one of these, and in  accepting it he well knew the difficulties of the task before him, for  hardly anything was known about the cholera poison, or where it should be  sought; whether it was to be found only in the intestinal canal, or in the  blood, or elsewhere. Nor was it known whether it was of bacterial nature,  or fungoid, or an animal parasite--e.g., an amoeba. But other difficulties  appeared in an unexpected direction. From the accounts given in text-books  he had imagined that the cholera intestine would show very slight changes,  and would be filled with a clear \"rice-water\" fluid. He had not fully  recollected the conditions met with in post-mortem examinations had  formerly made, and was therefore at first surprised to meet with quite a  different state of things. For he soon found that in a large majority of  cases remarkably severe lesions were present in the intestines. In other  cases the changes were slighter, and eventually he met with some which, to  a certain extent, corresponded with the type described in text-books. But  it was some time, and after many inspections, before he was enabled to  correctly interpret the varied changes met with. In spite of a most  careful examination of all other organs and of the Mood, nothing was found  to establish the presence of an infective material, and attention was  finally concentrated on the intestinal conditions.    There were cases in which the lower segment of the small intestine, most  marked immediately above the ileocaecal valve, extending thence upward, was  of a dark reddish-brown color, the mucous membrane being covered with  superficial haemorrhages. In many cases the mucous membrane appeared to be  superficially necrosed, and covered with diphtheritic patches. The  intestinal contents in such cases were not colorless, but consisted of a  sanguinolent, ichorous, putrid fluid. Other cases showed a gradual  transition to a less marked change. The redness was less intense, and was  in patches, while in others the injection was limited to the margins of  the follicular and Peyerian glands, giving an appearance which is quite  peculiar to cholera. In comparatively few cases were the changes so slight  as to consist in a somewhat swollen and opaque condition of the  superficial layers of the mucous membrane, with delicate rosy-red  injection, and some prominence of the solitary follicles and Peyer's  patches. In such cases the intestinal contents were colorless, but  resembling meal-soup rather than rice-water. In only a solitary instance  were the contents watery and mucoid. Microscopical examination of the  intestine and its contents revealed, especially in the cases where the  margins of Peyer's patches were reddened, a considerable invasion of  bacteria, occurring partly within the tubular glands, partly between the  epithelium and basement membrane, and in some parts deeper still. Then he  found cases in which, besides bacteria of one definite and constant form,  there were others also accumulated within and around the tubular glands,  of various size, some short and thick, others very fine; and be soon  concluded that he had to do here with a primary invasion of pathogenic  bacilli, which, as it were, prepared the tissues for the entrance of the  non-pathogenic forms, just as he had observed, in the necrotic,  diphtheritic changes in the intestinal mucosa and in typhoid ulcers.    Passing to speak of the microscopical character of the contents of the  bowel, Dr. Koch said that owing to the sanguinolent and putrescent  character of these in the cases first examined, no conclusion was arrived  at for some time. Thus he found multitudes of bacteria of various kinds,  rendering it impossible to distinguish any special forms, and it was not  until he had examined two acute and uncomplicated cases, before haemorrhage  had occurred, and where the evacuation had not decomposed, that he found  more abundantly the kind of organism which had been seen so richly in the  intestinal mucosa. He then proceeded to describe the characters of this  bacterium. It is smaller than the tubercle bacillus, being only about half  or at most two-thirds the size of the latter, but much more plump,  thicker, and slightly curved. As a rule, the curve is no more than that of  a comma (,) but sometimes it assumes a semicircular shape, and he has seen  it forming a double curve like an S, these two variations from the normal  being suggestive of the junction of two individual bacilli. In cultures  there always appears a remarkably free development of comma shaped  bacilli. These bacilli often grow out to form long threads, not in the  manner of anthrax bacilli, nor with a simple undulating form, but assuming  the shape of delicate long spirals, a corkscrew shape, reminding one very  forcibly of the spirochaete of relapsing fever. Indeed, it would be  difficult to distinguish the two if placed side by side. On account of  this developmental change, he doubted if the cholera organism should be  ranked with bacilli; it is rather a transitional form between the bacillus  and the spirillum. Possibly it is a true spirillum, portions of which  appear in the comma shape, much as in other spirilla--_e. g_., spirilla  undula, which do not always form complete spirals, but consist only of  more or less curved rods. The comma bacilli thrive well in meat infusion,  growing in it with great rapidity. By examining, microscopically, a drop  of this broth culture the baccilli are seen in active movement, swarming  at the margins of the drop, interspersed with the spiral threads, which  are also apparently mobile. They grow also in other fluids--_e. g_., very  abundantly in milk, without coagulating it or changing its appearance.  Also in blood serum they grow very richly.    Another good nutrient medium is gelatine, wherein the comma bacilli form  colonies of a perfectly characteristic kind, different from those of any  other form of bacteria. The colony when very young appears as a pale and  small spot, not completely spherical as other bacterial colonies in  gelatine are wont to be, but with a more or less irregular, protruding, or  jagged contour. It also very soon takes on a somewhat granular appearance.  As the colony increases, the granular character becomes more marked, until  it seems to be made up of highly refractile granules, like a mass of  particles of glass. In its further growth the gelatine is liquefied in the  vicinity of the colony, which at the same time sinks down deeper into the  gelatine mass, and makes a small thread-like excavation in the gelatine,  in the center of which the colony appears as a small white point. This  again is peculiar; it is never seen, at least so marked, with any other  bacterium. And a similar appearance is produced when gelatine is  inoculated with a pure culture of this bacillus, the gelatine liquefying  at the seat of inoculation, and the small colony continually enlarging;  but above it there occurs the excavated spot, like a bubble of air  floating over the bacillary colony. It gives the impression that the  bacillus growth not only liquefies the gelatine, but causes a rapid  evaporation of the fluid so formed. Many bacteria also have the power of  so liquefying gelatine with which they are inoculated, but never do they  produce such an excavation with the bladder-like cavity on the surface.    Another peculiarity was the slowness with which the gelatine liquefied,  and the narrow limits of this liquefaction in the case of a gelatine disk.  Cultures of the comma bacillus were also made in agar-agar jelly, which is  not liquefied by them. On potato these bacilli grow like those of  glanders, forming a grayish-brown layer on the surface. The comma bacilli  thrive best at temperatures between 30 deg. and 40 deg. C., but they are not very  sensitive to low temperatures, their growth not being prevented until 17 deg.  or 16 deg. C. is reached. In this respect they agree with anthrax"]]]
