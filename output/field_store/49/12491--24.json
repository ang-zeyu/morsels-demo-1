All now sued for peace, which, with  sundry floggings, was granted. For three months they now kept away from  the Mission.    In 1777 they began to return, and on October 4, Padre Serra, on his  first visit, was able to say mass in the presence of seventeen adult  native converts. Then, passing over to the presidio on October 10, as he  stood gazing on the waters flowing out to the setting sun through the  purple walls of the Golden Gate, he exclaimed with a heart too full of  thanksgiving to be longer restrained: \"Thanks be to God that now our  father St. Francis with the Holy Cross of the Procession of Missions,  has reached the last limit of the Californian continent. To go farther  he must have boats.\"    In 1782, April 25, the corner-stone of a new church was laid at San  Francisco. Three padres were present, together with the Mission guard  and a body of troops from the presidio. In the Mission records it says:  \"There was enclosed in the cavity of said corner-stone the image of our  Holy Father St. Francis, some relics in the form of bones of St. Pius  and other holy martyrs, five medals of various saints, and a goodly  portion of silver coin.\"    In 1785 Governor Pages complained to the viceroy, among other things,  that the presidio of San Francisco had been deprived of mass for three  years, notwithstanding the obligation of the friars to serve as  chaplains. Palou replied that the padres were under no obligation to  serve gratuitously, and that they were always ready to attend the  soldiers when their other duties allowed.    In November, 1787, Captain Soler, who for a brief time acted as  temporary governor and inspector, suggested that the presidio of San  Francisco be abandoned and its company transferred to Santa Barbara.  Later, as I have shown elsewhere, a proposition was again made for the  abandonment of San Francisco; so it is apparent that Fate herself was  protecting it for its future great and wonderful history.    In 1790 San Francisco reported 551 baptisms and 205 deaths, with a  present neophyte population of 438. Large stock had increased to 2000  head and small to 1700.    Three years later, on November 14, the celebrated English navigator,  George Vancouver, in his vessel \"Discovery,\" sailed into San Francisco  Bay. His arrival caused quite a flutter of excitement both at the  presidio and Mission, where he was kindly entertained. The governor was  afraid of this elaborate hospitality to the hated and feared English,  and issued orders to the commandant providing for a more frigid  reception in the future, so, on Vancouver's second visit, he did not  find matters so agreeable, and grumbled accordingly.    Tiles were made and put on the church roofs in 1795; more houses were  built for the neophytes, and all roofed with tiles. Half a league of  ditch was also dug around the potrero (pasture ground) and fields.    In 1806 San Francisco was enlivened by the presence of the Russian  chamberlain, Rezanof, who had been on a special voyage around the world,  and was driven by scurvy and want of provisions to the California  settlements. He was accompanied by Dr. G.H. von Langsdorff. Langsdorff's  account of the visit and reception at several points in California is  interesting. He gives a full description of the Indians and their method  of life at the Mission; commends the zeal and self-sacrifice of the  padres; speaks of the ingenuity shown by the women in making baskets;  the system of allowing the cattle and horses to run wild, etc. Visiting  the Mission of San Jose by boat, he and his companions had quite an  adventurous time getting back, owing to the contrary winds.    Rezanof's visit and its consequences have been made the subject of much  and romantic writing. Gertrude Atherton's novel, _Rezanof_, is devoted  to this episode in his life. The burden of the story is possibly true,  viz., that the Russians in their settlements to the north were suffering  for want of the food that California was producing in abundance. Yet,  owing to the absurd Spanish laws governing California, she was forbidden  to sell to or trade with any foreign peoples or powers. Rezanof, who was  well acquainted with this prohibitory law, determined upon trying to  overcome it for the immediate relief of his suffering compatriots. He  was fairly well received when he reached San Francisco, but he could  accomplish nothing in the way of trading or the sale of the needed  provisions.    Now began a campaign of strategic waiting. To complicate (or simplify)  the situation, in the _bailes_ and _festas_ given to the distinguished  Russian, Rezanof danced and chatted with Concha Argueello, the daughter  of the stern old commandant of the post.    Did they fall in love with each other, or did they not? Some writers say  one thing and some another. Anyhow, the girl thought she had received  the honest love of a noble man and responded with ardor and devotion. So  sure was she of his affection that she finally prevailed upon her father  (so we are told) to sell to Rezanof the provisions for which he had  come. The vessel, accordingly, was well and satisfactorily laden and  Rezanof sailed away. Being a Russian subject, he was not allowed to  marry the daughter of a foreigner without the consent of his sovereign,  and he was to hurry to Moscow and gain permission to return and wed the  lady of his choice.    He never returned. Hence the accusation that he acted in bad faith to  her and her father. This charge seems to be unfounded, for it is known  that he left his vessel and started overland to reach Moscow earlier  than he could have done by ship, that he was taken seriously ill on the  trip and died.    But Concha did not know of this. No one informed her of the death of her  lover, and her weary waiting for his return is what has given the touch  of keenest pathos to the romantic story. Bret Harte, in his inimitable  style, has put into exquisite verse, the story of the waiting of this  true-hearted Spanish maiden[4]:    [4] From Poems by Bret Harte. By permission of the publishers, The  Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, Mass.         \"He with grave provincial magnates long had held serene debate       On the Treaty of Alliance and the high affairs of state;         He from grave provincial magnates oft had turned to talk apart       With the Comandante's daughter on the questions of the heart,         Until points of gravest import yielded slowly one by one,       And by Love was consummated what Diplomacy begun;         Till beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are,       He received the twofold contract for approval of the Czar;         Till beside the brazen cannon the betrothed bade adieu,       And from sallyport and gateway north the Russian eagles flew.         Long beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are,       Did they wait the promised bridegroom and the answer of the Czar.         Day by day ...         Week by week ...         So each year the seasons shifted,--wet and warm and drear and dry;       Half a year of clouds and flowers, half a year of dust and sky.         Still it brought no ship nor message,--brought no tidings, ill or           meet,       For the statesmanlike Commander, for the daughter fair and sweet.         Yet she heard the varying message, voiceless to all ears beside:       'He will come,' the flowers whispered; 'Come no more,' the dry hills           sighed.         Then the grim Commander, pacing where the brazen cannon are,       Comforted the maid with proverbs, wisdom gathered from afar;           *       *       *       *       *         So with proverbs and caresses, half in faith and half in doubt,       Every day some hope was kindled, flickered, faded, and went out.           *       *       *       *       *         Forty years on wall and bastion swept the hollow idle breeze       Since the Russian eagle fluttered from the California seas;         Forty years on wall and bastion wrought its slow but sure decay,       And St. George's cross was lifted in the port of Monterey;         And the Citadel was lighted, and the hall was gaily drest,       All to honor Sir George Simpson, famous traveler and guest.           *       *       *       *       *         The formal speeches ended, and amidst the laugh and wine,       Some one spoke of Concha's lover,--heedless of the warning sign.         Quickly then cried Sir George Simpson: 'Speak no ill           of him, I pray!       He is dead. He died, poor fellow, forty years ago this           day.--         'Died while speeding home to Russia, falling from a           fractious horse.       Left a sweetheart, too, they tell me. Married, I           suppose, of course!         'Lives she yet?' A deathlike silence fell on banquet,           guests, and hall,       And a trembling figure rising fixed the awestruck gaze           of all.         Two black eyes in darkened orbits gleamed beneath the           nun's white hood;       Black serge hid the wasted figure, bowed and stricken           where it stood.         'Lives she yet?' Sir George repeated. All were hushed           as Concha drew       Closer yet her nun's attire. 'Senyor, pardon, she died,           too!'\"    In 1810 Moraga, the ensign at the presidio, was sent with seventeen men  to punish the gentiles of the region of the Carquines Strait, who for  several years had been harassing the neophytes at San Francisco, and  sixteen of whom they had killed. Moraga had a hard fight against a  hundred and twenty of them, and captured eighteen, whom he soon  released, \"as they were all sure to die of their wounds.\" The survivors  retreated to their huts and made a desperate resistance, and were so  determined not to be captured that, when one hut was set on fire, its  inmates preferred to perish in the flames rather than to surrender. A  full report of this affair was sent to the King of Spain and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#19)"],[1,"of their measures. This is the necessary course, if no       particular compact intervenes for the restitution of such       property taken before a formal declaration of       hostilities.\"[202]    The modern rule seems to be, that tangible property, belonging to an  enemy, ought _not_ to be _immediately confiscated_. It may be  considered as the opinion of all who have written on the _jus belli_,  that war gives the _right_ to confiscate, but does not of itself  confiscate the property of an enemy.    Chancellor Kent expressly terms this species of hostility--_a  reprisal_.[203] And Lord Mansfield says, that though foreign ports or  harbours are not the high sea any more than the shore, yet numberless  captures made there have been condemned as prize,[204] _i.e._ can be  the subject _of reprisal_.        NOTE B.--_War Bill Act_.    During the last war, the War Bill Act, 34 Geo. 3. c. 9, was passed as  a measure of retaliation. It was passed in order to prevent the effect  intended to be produced by an order of the French Government,  compelling all merchants, bankers, and others, possessed of money,  funded property, and effects, in different parts Europe, to declare  all such property, that it might be taken by violence, and applied to  the purposes of the war then carried on by the government of France  against the greater part of Europe.    The principal sections relating to bills, prohibited any British  subject, from and after March 1, 1794, from wilfully and knowingly in  any manner paying or satisfying any bill of exchange, note, draught,  obligation, or order for money, in part or in whole, which, since  January 1, 1794, had been or at any time during the said war should be  drawn, accepted, or indorsed, or in any manner sent from any part of  the dominions of France, &c.; every person so offending to forfeit  _double_ the value, and the payment not to be effectual against any  person who might otherwise have demanded the same; but the demands of  all persons to remain, notwithstanding such payment, and  notwithstanding such bills shall have been delivered up.        NOTE C.--_Rule of_ 1756.    During the war of 1756, the French Government, finding the trade with  their colonies cut off by the maritime superiority of Great Britain,  relaxed the monopoly of that trade, and allowed the Dutch, then  neutral, to carry on the commerce between the mother country and her  colonies, under special licences or passes, granted for this  particular purpose, excluding at the same time, all other neutrals  from the same trade. Many of their vessels were captured by the  British cruizers.    The policy under which they were captured is called the \"Rule of  1756;\" and as, in the present war, its justice and propriety has  already begun to be doubted, it may not be uninteresting to read the  reasons upon which it was founded.    1. They were considered as part of the French navigation, having  adopted this otherwise exclusive commerce, and acting in the character  of French enemy in identifying themselves with that interest, in  direct opposition to the belligerent interests and purposes of Great  Britain.    2. Inasmuch as they were only carriers for the French, they were to be  regarded as French transports, carrying national assistance to the  enemy, and therefore to be condemned on the same principle as vessels  carrying troops or despatches.    3. That the property they carried being from one part of the French  empire to the other, was so completely identified with French  interests as to take a hostile character.    4. When war comes it is necessary to shut some of the avenues of  commerce, otherwise the belligerent rights could not be protected.    5. That the neutral ought not to have _through_ and by means of the  war, which is not his affair, that he has not in time of peace; and by  natural justice he is only entitled to his accustomed trade. That any  inconveniences he may suffer are quite balanced by the enlargement of  his commerce; the trade of the belligerents is usually interrupted to  a great degree, and falls into the lap of the neutral.[205]    6. That it is a direct assistance to the enemy, and an injury to the  belligerent interests of the other country, to carry on for the enemy  the commerce that she has lost by the pressure of the war,--rendering  the efforts of the successful power nugatory.        NOTE D.--_Articles that have been declared Contraband at various  times._    Gunpowder, arms, military equipments, and other things peculiarly  adapted to military purposes.    Sail cloths, masts, anchors, pitch, tar, and hemp, universally  contraband, even when destined to ports not of military equipment.    Cheeses, fit for naval use; such as Dutch cheeses, when exclusively  used in French ships of war.    Rosin, tallow, and ship biscuits, if destined to ports of military or  naval equipment.    Similarly, of Wines.    And ship timber, when so destined.    Ships of war, or ships adapted for such service, going to a port of  the enemy for sale.    Copper in sheets, certified by government dockyard officers as fit for  the sheathing of ships.    Brimstone, destined to a port of warlike equipment.        NOTE E.--_The Late Declarations_.    The first manifesto or declaration of war issued by the Queen, so far  follows the ancient form, that it gives a justification of the war,  but differs from it in the omission of a general command to all her  subjects to commit hostilities on the enemy. By this command (in the  ancient form), the subjects were in general ordered, not only to break  off all intercourse with the enemy, but also to _attack_ him. Custom  interpreted this general order. It authorized, and even obliged every  subject, of whatever rank, to secure the person and things belonging  to the enemy when they fell into his hands; but it did not invite the  subjects to undertake any offensive expedition without a commission or  particular order. The present manifesto simply proclaims that the  Queen of England has taken up arms against Russia, that is, has  declared \"a state of war.\" The omission of an injunction to break off  intercourse, and to exercise hostility, does not relieve the subject  from his duty in that respect; for war may commence without any  manifesto, and any official recognition of the \"state of war\" casts  upon the subject his full duties under that condition of things. The  ancient form has been judiciously allowed to drop, leading, as it  might have done, to misconception on the part of her majesty's lieges.    The second manifesto has reference to regulations with respect to  neutral commerce, and speaks for itself.    The third is as follows, and the references to the text will be  sufficient to explain it.        DECLARATION.    Her Majesty, the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and  Ireland, having been compelled to take up arms in support of an Ally,  is desirous of rendering the war as little onerous as possible to the  powers with whom she remains at peace.    To preserve the commerce of neutrals from all unnecessary obstruction,  Her Majesty is willing, for the present, to waive a part of the  belligerent rights appertaining to Her by the Law of Nations.    It is impossible for Her Majesty to forego the exercise of her right  of seizing articles contraband of war,[206] and of preventing neutrals  from bearing the enemy's dispatches,[207] and she must maintain the  right of a belligerent to prevent neutrals from breaking any effective  blockade which may be established with an adequate force against the  enemy's forts, harbours, or coasts.[208]    But Her Majesty will waive the right of seizing enemy's property laden  on board a neutral vessel, unless it be contraband of war.[209]    It is not Her Majesty's intention to claim the confiscation of neutral  property, not being contraband of war, found on board enemy's  ships,[210] and Her Majesty further declares, that being anxious to  lessen as much as possible the evils of war, and to restrict its  operations to the regularly organized forces of the country, it is not  her present intention to issue letters of marque for the commissioning  of privateers.    Westminster, March 28, 1854.        THE FOURTH DECLARATION.    At the Court at Buckingham Palace, the 29th day of March, 1854,  Present, The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council. Her Majesty  having determined to afford active assistance to Her Ally, His  Highness the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, for the protection of his  dominions against the encroachments and unprovoked aggression of His  Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, Her Majesty,  therefore, is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to  order, and it is hereby ordered, that general reprisals[211] be  granted against the ships, vessels, and goods of the Emperor of all  the Russias, and of his subjects or others inhabiting within any of  his countries, territories, or dominions, _so that Her Majesty's  fleets and ships_ shall and may lawfully seize all ships, vessels, and  goods, belonging to the Emperor of all the Russias, or his subjects,  or others inhabiting within any of his countries, territories, or  dominions, and bring the same to judgment in such Courts of Admiralty  within Her Majesty's dominions, possessions, or colonies, as shall be  duly commissionated to take cognizance thereof. And to that end Her  Majesty's Advocate-General, with the Advocate of Her Majesty in Her  Office of Admiralty, are forthwith to prepare the draft of a  Commission, and present the same to Her Majesty at this Board,  authorizing the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High  Admiral to will and require the High Court of Admiralty of England,  and the Lieutenant and Judge of the said Court, his Surrogate or  Surrogates, as also the several Courts of Admiralty within Her  Majesty's dominions, which shall be duly commissionated to take  cognizance"]]]
