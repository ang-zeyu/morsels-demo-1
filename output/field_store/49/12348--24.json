The political authorities, who  might be induced by fanatical theologians to settle disputes by violent  inquisitorial means, have been prevented for a long time from such  interference by more pressing affairs.    A knowledge alone of the orthodox system of Islam, however complete, would  give us an even more inadequate idea of the actual world of catholic Islam  than the notion we should acquire of the spiritual currents moving the  Roman Catholic world by merely studying the dogma and the canonical law of  the Church of Rome.    Nevertheless, the unity of Islamic thought is by no means a word void of  sense. The ideas of Mohammedan philosophers, borrowed for a great part from  Neoplatonism, the pantheism and the emanation theory of Mohammedan mystics  are certainly still further distant from the simplicity of Qoranic  religion than the orthodox dogmatics; but all those conceptions alike show  indubitable marks of having grown up on Mohammedan soil. In the works even  of those mystics who efface the limits between things human and divine,  who put Judaism, Christianity, and Paganism on the same line with the  revelation of Mohammed, and who are therefore duly anathematized by the  whole orthodox world, almost every page testifies to the relation of the  ideas enounced with Mohammedan civilization. Most of the treatises on  science, arts, or law written by Egyptian students for their doctor's  degree at European universities make no exception to this rule; the manner  in which these authors conceive the problems and strive for their solution  is, in a certain sense, in the broadest sense of course, Mohammedan. Thus,  if we speak of Mohammedan thought, civilization, spirit, we have to bear in  mind the great importance of the system which, almost unchanged, has been  delivered for about one thousand years by one generation of doctors of  Islam to the other, although it has become ever more unfit to meet the  needs of the Community, on whose infallible Agreement it rests. But, at the  same time, we ought to consider that beside the agreement of canonists,  of dogmatists, and of mystics, there are a dozen more agreements, social,  political, popular, philosophical, and so on, and that however great may be  the influence of the doctors, who pretend to monopolize infallibility for  the opinions on which they agree, the real Agreement of Islam is the least  common measure of all the agreements of the groups which make up the  Community.    It would require a large volume to review the principal currents of thought  pervading the Moslim world in our day; but a general notion may be acquired  by a rapid glance at two centres, geographically not far distant from each  other, but situated at the opposite poles of spiritual life: Mecca and  Cairo.    In Mecca yearly two or three hundred thousand Moslims from all parts of the  world come together to celebrate the hajj, that curious set of ceremonies  of pagan Arabian origin which Mohammed has incorporated into his religion,  a durable survival that in Islam makes an impression as singular as that  of jumping processions in Christianity. Mohammed never could have foreseen  that the consequence of his concession to deeply rooted Arabic custom  would be that in future centuries Chinese, Malays, Indians, Tatars, Turks,  Egyptians, Berbers, and negroes would meet on this barren desert soil and  carry home profound impressions of the international significance of Islam.  Still more important is the fact that from all those countries young people  settle here for years to devote themselves to the study of the sacred  science. From the second to the tenth month of the Mohammedan lunar year,  the Haram, _i.e._, the mosque, which is an open place with the Ka'bah in  its midst and surrounded by large roofed galleries, has free room enough  between the hours of public service to allow of a dozen or more circles of  students sitting down around their professors to listen to as many lectures  on different subjects, generally delivered in a very loud voice. Arabic  grammar and style, prosody, logic, and other preparatory branches, the  sacred trivium; canonic law, dogmatics, and mysticism, and, for the more  advanced, exegesis of Qoran and Tradition and some other branches of  supererogation, are taught here in the mediaeval way from mediaeval  text-books or from more modern compilations reproducing their contents and  completing them more or less by treating modern questions according to the  same methods.    It is now almost thirty years since I lived the life of a Meccan student  during one university year, after having become familiar with the matter  taught by the professors of the temple of Mecca, the Haram, by privately  studying it, so that I could freely use all my time in observing the  mentality of people learning those things not for curiosity, but in order  to acquire the only true direction for their life in this world and the  salvation of their souls in the world to come. For a modern man there could  hardly be a better opportunity imagined for getting a true vision of the  Middle Ages than is offered to the Orientalist by a few months' stay in  the Holy City of Islam. In countries like China, Tibet, or India there  are spheres of spiritual life which present to us still more interesting  material for comparative study of religions than that of Mecca, because  they are so much more distant from our own; but, just on that account,  the Western student would not be able to adapt his mind to their mental  atmospheres as he may do in Mecca. No one would think for one moment of  considering Confucianism, Hinduism, or Buddhism as specially akin to  Christianity, whereas Islam has been treated by some historians of the  Christian Church as belonging to the heretical offspring of the Christian  religion. In fact, if we are able to abstract ourselves for a moment from  all dogmatic prejudice and to become a Meccan with the Meccans, one of the  \"neighbours of Allah,\" as they call themselves, we feel in their temple,  the Haram, as if we were conversing with our ancestors of five or six  centuries ago. Here scholasticism with a rabbinical tint forms the great  attraction to the minds of thousands of intellectually highly gifted men of  all ages.    The most important lectures are delivered during the forenoon and in the  evening. A walk, at one of those hours, through the square and under the  colonnades of the mosque, with ears opened to all sides, will enable you to  get a general idea of the objects of mental exercise of this international  assembly. Here you may find a sheikh of pure Arab descent explaining to his  audience, composed of white Syrians or Circassians, of brown and yellow  Abyssinians and Egyptians, of negroes, Chinese, and Malays, the probable  and improbable legal consequences of marriage contracts, not excepting  those between men and genii; there a negro scholar is explaining the  ontological evidence of the existence of a Creator and the logical  necessity of His having twenty qualities, inseparable from, but not  identical with, His essence; in the midst of another circle a learned  _mufti_ of indeterminably mixed extraction demonstrates to his pupils from  the standard work of al-Ghazali the absolute vanity of law and doctrine to  those whose hearts are not purified from every attachment to the world.  Most of the branches of Mohammedan learning are represented within the  walls of this temple by more or less famous scholars; and still there are a  great number of private lectures delivered at home by professors who do not  like to be disturbed by the unavoidable noise in the mosque, which during  the whole day serves as a meeting place for friends or business men, as an  exercise hall for Qoran reciters, and even as a passage for people going  from one part of the town to the other.    In order to complete your mediaeval dream with a scene from daily life, you  have only to leave the mosque by the Bab Dereybah, one of its twenty-two  gates, where you may see human merchandise exhibited for sale by the  slave-brokers, and then to have a glance, outside the wall, at a camel  caravan, bringing firewood and vegetables into the town, led by Beduins  whose outward appearance has as little changed as their minds since the day  when Mohammed began here to preach the Word of Allah.    To the greater part of the world represented by this international  exhibition of Islam, as a modern Musulman writer calls it, our modern  world, with all its problems, its emotions, its learning and science,  hardly exists. On the other hand, the average modern man does not  understand much more of the mental life of the two hundred millions to whom  the barren Mecca has become the great centre. In former days, other centres  were much more important, although Mecca has always been the goal of  pilgrimage and the cherished abode of many learned men. Many capitals of  Islam offered the students an easier life and better accommodations for  their studies; while in Mecca four months of the year are devoted to the  foreign guests of Allah, by attending to whose various needs all Meccans  gain their livelihood. For centuries Cairo has stood unrivalled as a seat  of Mohammedan learning of every kind; and even now the Uaram of Mecca is  not to be compared to the Azhar-mosque as regards the number and the fame  of its professors and the variety of branches cultivated.    In the last half-century, however, the ancient repute of the Egyptian  metropolis has suffered a good deal from the enormous increase of European  influence in the land of the Pharaohs; the effects of which have made  themselves felt even in the Azhar. Modern programs and methods of  instruction have been adopted; and, what is still worse, modernism itself,  favoured by the late Mufti Muhammed Abduh, has made its entrance into the  sacred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#19)"],[1,"how to save their own skins.    All protest meetings were cancelled on August 1st, and the Press  restricted itself to chronicling rumours and events. The sitting of the  Reichstag was awaited with impatience as that was expected to bring more  light on the crisis. The effect which Bethmann-Hollweg produced upon his  hearers was to convince them that Russia alone was to blame. \"The  question of supporting the war by voting a loan was all the easier for  us to decide, because the provocation had come, not from France or  England, but from Russia. I admit openly that while I was travelling to  Berlin to the Reichstag I had very little time to hunt for precedents in  the party's history to determine my vote. For me the force of  circumstances alone was decisive; the material interests of the working  classes and the entire nation; common sense and the realization of a  practical policy.\"[75]    [Footnote 75: \"Die Kriegssitzung des deutschen Reichstags\" (\"The War  Sitting of the Reichstag\"), by Karl Hildenbrand, Member for Stuttgart.  Published 1915; p. 13.]    \"At the time of voting on August 4th, we were not in a position to take  England into consideration, because at the moment she had not yet  declared war. But by England's intervention our attitude on August 4th  has been still more emphatically justified.\"[76]    [Footnote 76: Ibid., p. 16.]    This statement is a gross distortion of the truth. It is true that  England had not yet declared war, but Sir Edward Grey had made England's  attitude quite clear on the previous day. His speech had been published  in the Berlin papers. Furthermore, the Chancellor informed the Reichstag  that England's position was perfectly clear, although he suppressed the  fact that Germany had begun preparations for war with this country five  days before, by ordering civilians to leave Heligoland, and despatching  the _Koenigin Luise_ to lay mines on our coasts.    In any case, the action of the Social Democrats on that occasion is an  example of unfaithfulness to principles. Accepting the invasion fear as  a ground for voting a loan for a war of defence, there is still no  evident reason why they should vote funds for a war of aggression  against Belgium. On the surface, there is no explanation for their  cheers when Bethmann-Hollweg announced the invasion of two neutral  States by Germany's armies.    Had they been tricked into supporting an alleged defensive war, there  was still time to protest against German hordes overrunning two weak  neighbouring countries. In spite of their terror that they personally  might suffer through the horrors of war, their vaunted humanitarianism  led to no outcry against those same horrors being wilfully and  ruthlessly forced upon their Belgian _Genossen_.    The only anxiety which the speech of their chosen spokesman, Herr Haase,  betrays, is the anxiety to avoid responsibility. \"In the name of my  party I am empowered to make the following declaration: We are standing  in an hour of solemn destiny. The consequences of the imperialistic  policy--which brought about an era of armaments and made international  difficulties more acute--have now fallen upon Europe like a storm-flood.    \"The responsibility for this recoils upon the leaders of that policy; we  decline to accept it. Social Democracy has fought against this ominous  development with all the forces at its command. Up to the very last hour  we have worked for the maintenance of peace through mighty  demonstrations in every land, especially in intimate cooperation with  our French brothers. (Applause from the Social Democrats.) Our efforts  have been in vain.    \"Now we are face to face with the stern reality of war. We are  threatened by the terrors of a hostile invasion. To-day we have not to  decide either for or against war, but only concerning the necessary  means for the defence of our country. Now we have to think of the  millions of our _Genossen_ who are innocently swept into this fate. They  will suffer most through the devastations of war. Our ardent wishes  accompany also our brothers who are called to the flag without  distinction of party. (Loud applause.)    \"We think, too, of the mothers who must give their sons and of the women  and children who are robbed of their bread-winners, and to whose fear  for their loved ones is added the dread of hunger. Tens of thousands of  wounded and mutilated warriors will soon be added to these. We consider  it our most compelling duty to help them, to lighten their burdens and  relieve their distress.[77] (Loud applause.)    [Footnote 77: There is every reason to believe that the party has worked  hard to keep this promise.--Author.]    \"In case of a victory for Russian despotism, which is already stained  with the blood of Russia's best sons, much--if not everything--is at  stake for our people and our free future. It is a question of averting  this danger, and of securing the culture and independence of our own  country. (Loud applause.)    \"Now we will redeem our oft repeated pledge: In the hour of danger we  shall not leave our Fatherland in the lurch. (Loud applause.) Thereby,  we feel ourselves in unison with the principles of internationalism  which have always admitted the right of each single people to national  independence and national defence. We condemn, as internationalism does,  every war of conquest.    \"We demand, that, as soon as the goal of security has been attained and  our enemies are inclined to make peace, the war shall end by a peace  that will make friendship with neighbouring countries possible. We  demand this, not only in the interests of the international solidarity  for which we have uniformly fought, but also in the interests of the  German nation.    \"We hope that the cruel school of war's sufferings will awaken a horror  for war in new millions, and win them over to the socialistic ideal and  international peace. Guided by these principles we vote in favour of the  war loan. (Loud applause.)\"[78]    [Footnote 78: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 5th.]    A short historical comparison will assist in making the Social  Democratic action still clearer. In 1870, when Bismarck asked the  Reichstag for a war credit to prosecute the campaign against France, the  Socialists were few and helpless. Yet Liebknecht and Bebel refused to  vote in its favour. \"Their moral demonstration was in itself perfectly  logical, for Bismarck's and Napoleon III.'s intrigues equally deserved  condemnation.\"[79]    [Footnote 79: Kautsky: \"Die Internationalitat und der Krieg,\" p. 19.]    Apparently it did not occur to the Democrats in 1914, that probably  Germany had again been guilty of intrigues. It is noteworthy, however,  that the small party in 1870 protested when a national issue was at  stake, while the mighty party of 1914 made no protest whatever,  although, as they had previously announced and denounced, the issue had  been raised by the unjust actions and vile intrigues of Austrian  imperialism.    The campaign against Russia conducted by the nationalist Press up till  August 1st was taken up by the organs representing Social Democracy,  immediately war broke out. Their papers were flooded with appalling  pictures of Russian (generally termed Asiatic) barbarism, tyranny and  misrule. Passages from the speeches and writings of Bebel, Liebknecht  and others were quoted to show the fiendishness of Russian policy, and  the justice of every German doing his utmost to smash Czarism and  deliver millions of fellow workmen from its thrall. Even a  blood-and-thunder story of the Russian police was turned on as a serial  story in their daily papers.[80] In short, nothing was omitted which  goes to make _Stimmung_.    [Footnote 80: \"Der Polizeimeister, ein russischer Polizeiroman,\" by  Gabryela Zapolska. The story commenced in the Nuremberg party organ on  August 11th, and in Kautsky's _Leipztger Volkszeitung_ on August 18th.]    Had they been honestly impartial a still blacker picture of Austria,  painted by one of the founders of the workmen's movement, might have  been quoted, yet it might have been indiscreet to tell Germans what  Lassalle wrote. \"Austria? Russia is a mammoth, barbarian Empire which  its despotic rulers endeavour to civilize, just so far as suits their  despotic interests. In that country barbarism is excusable, because it  is a national element. But the case is very different with Austria.  There it is the government which represents the barbaric principle and  crushes beneath it by artifice and violence, the civilized peoples under  its rule.\"[81]    [Footnote 81: Bernstein's edition of Lassalle's \"Reden und Schriften,\"  vol. I., p. 306.]    With the exception of a few Britishers, the Socialists of all countries  have unanimously condemned the attitude of the German party. Not the  least interesting is the condemnation expressed by the Italian section.  Dr. Suedekum, Reichstag member for Nuremberg, was sent to Italy to  discuss the situation with Italian Socialists and justify their own  action in supporting the war. The following account of the meeting  appeared in the _Vorwaerts_ for September 12th: \"The meeting lasted from  3.30 p.m. till 7 p.m. Suedekum declared that he had come to inform their  Italian comrades of the situation in which the German Socialists found  themselves, and in order to learn whether the Italians had taken any  steps to keep up communications with Democrats in other lands.    \"We hold firmly to the contention that the German Socialists could have  done nothing except what they did. My presence here is a proof that we  Germans are aware of our duties towards internationalism.[82] We  believed that the German Government had given proof of its peaceful  tendencies and was forced into war against its will. Therefore, the  Social Democratic Party supported it.    [Footnote 82: There is no evidence to show that Suedekum's Italian visit  had any other purpose than winning"]]]
