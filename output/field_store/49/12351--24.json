Got a stride as long as from here to that shed,  they say.\"    He rambled on with a growing enthusiasm.    \"And think of a hoss like that being given away!\"    \"Given away?\" said Bull with a sudden interest.    And then he remembered that horses were outside of his education  entirely.    He listened with gloomy attention while his host went on. \"Yes, sir.  Given away is what I said and given away is what I mean. Old Chick  Bridewell has kept him long enough, he says. He's tired of paying  buckaroos for getting busted up trying to ride that hoss. Man-eater,  that's what he calls Diablo, and he wants to give the hoss away to the  first man that can ride him. Hal Dunbar heard about it and sent up  word that he was coming up to ride him.\"    \"He must be a brave man,\" said Bull innocently. He had an immense  capacity for admiring others.    \"Brave?\" The proprietor paused as though this had not occurred to him  before. \"Why, they ain't such a thing as fear in Hal Dunbar, I guess.  But if he decides to ride Diablo, he'll ride him, well enough. He has  his way about things, Hal Dunbar does.\"    The sketchy portrait impressed Bull Hunter greatly. \"You know him,  then?\"    \"How'd I be mistaking you for him if I knowed him? No, he lives way  down south, but they's a pile heard about him that's never seen him.\"    For some reason the words of his host remained in the mind of Bull as  he went down the road that day. Oddly enough, he pictured man and  horse as being somewhat alike--Diablo vast and black and fierce, and  Hal Dunbar dark and huge and terrible of eye, also; which was proof  enough that Bull Hunter was a good deal of a child. He cared less  about the world as it was than for the world as it might be, and as  long as life gave him something to dream about, he did not care in the  least about the facts of existence.    Another man would have been worried about the future; but Bull Hunter  went down the road with his swinging stride, perfectly at peace with  himself and with life. He had not enough money in his pocket to buy a  meal, but he was not thinking so far ahead.    It was still well before noon when he came in sight of the Bridewell  place. It varied not a whit from the typical ranch of that region, a  low-built collection of sheds and arms sprawling around the ranch  house itself. About the building was a far-flung network of corrals.  Bull Hunter found his way among them and followed a sound of  hammering. He was well among the sheds when a great black stallion  shot into view around a nearby corner, tossing his head and mane. He  was pursued by a shrill voice crying, \"Diablo! Hey! You old fool!  Stand still ... it's me ... it's Tod!\"    To the amazement of Bull Hunter, Diablo the Terrible, Diablo the  man-killer, paused and reluctantly turned about, shaking his head as  though he did not wish to obey but was compelled by the force of  conscience. At once a bare-legged boy of ten came in sight, running  and shaking his fist angrily at the giant horse. Indeed, it was a  tremendous animal. Not the seventeen hands that the hotel proprietor  had described to Bull, but a full sixteen three, and so proudly  high-headed, so stout-muscled of body, so magnificently long and  tapering of leg, that a wiser horseman than the hotelkeeper might have  put Diablo down for more than seventeen hands.    Most tall horses are like tall men--they are freakish and malformed in  some of their members; but Diablo was as trim as a pony. He had the  high withers, the mightily sloped shoulders, and the short back of a  weight carrier. And although at first glance his underpinning seemed  too frail to bear the great mass of his weight or withstand the effort  of his driving power of shoulders and deep, broad thighs, yet a closer  reckoning made one aware of the comfortable dimensions of the cannon  bone with all that this feature portended. Diablo carried his bulk  with the grace which comes of compacted power well in hand.    Not that Bull Hunter analyzed the stallion in any such fashion. He  was, literally, ignorant of horseflesh. But in spite of his ignorance  the long neck, not overfleshed, suggested length of stride and the  mighty girth meant wind beyond exhaustion and told of the great heart  within. The points of an ordinary animal may be overlooked, but a great  horse speaks for himself in every language and to every man. He was  coal-black, this Diablo, except for the white stocking of his off  forefoot; he was night-black, and so silken sleek that, as he turned  and pranced, flashes of light glimmered from shoulders to flanks.    Bull Hunter stared in amazement that changed to appreciation, and  appreciation that burst in one overpowering instant to the full  understanding of the beauty of the horse. Joy entered the heart of the  big man. He had looked on horses hitherto as pretty pictures perhaps,  but useless to him. Here was an animal that could bear him like the  wind wherever he would go. Here was a horse who could gallop  tirelessly under him all day and labor through the mountains, bearing  him as lightly as the cattle ponies bore ordinary men. The cumbersome  feeling of his own bulk, which usually weighed heavily on Bull,  disappeared. He felt light of heart and light of limb.    In the meantime the bare-legged boy had come to the side of the big  horse, still shrilling his anger. He stood under the lofty head of the  stallion and shook his small fist into the face of Diablo the  Terrible. And while Bull, quaking, expected to see the head torn from  the shoulders of the child, Diablo pointed his ears and sniffed the  fist of the boy inquisitively.    In fact, this could not be the horse of which the hotelkeeper had told  him, or perhaps he had been recently tamed and broken?    That, for some reason, made the heart of Bull Hunter sink.    The boy now reached up and twisted his fingers into the mane of the  black.    \"Come along now. And if you pull away ag'in, you old fool, Diablo,  I'll give you a thumping, I tell you. Git along!\"    Diablo meekly lowered his head and made his step mincing to regulate  his gait to that of his tiny master. He was brought alongside a rail  fence. There he waited patiently while the boy climbed up to the top  rail and then slid onto his back. Again Bull Hunter caught his breath.  He expected to see the stallion leap into the air and snap the child  high above his head with a single arching of his back, but there was  no such violent reaction. Diablo, indeed, turned his head with his  ears flattened and bared his teeth, but it was only to snort at the  knee of the boy. Plainly he was bluffing, if horses ever bluffed. The  boy carelessly dug his brown toes into the cheek of the great horse  and shoved his head about.    \"Giddap,\" he called. \"Git along, Diablo!\"    Diablo walked gently forward.    \"Hurry up! I ain't got all day!\" And the boy thumped the giant with  his bare heels.    Diablo broke into a trot as soft, as smooth flowing, as water passing  over a smooth bed of sand. Bull ran to the corner of the shed and  gaped after them until the pair slid around a corner and were gone.  Instinctively he drew off his hat and gaped.    He was startled back to himself by loud laughter nearby, and, looking  up, he saw an old fellow in overalls with a handful of nails and a  hammer. He stood among a scattering of uprights which represented,  apparently, the beginnings of the skeleton of a barn. Now he leaned  against one of these uprights and indulged his mirth. Bull regarded  him mildly; he was used to being laughed at.          CHAPTER 14      \"That's the way they all do,\" said the old man. \"They all gape the  same fool way when they see Diablo the first time.\"    \"Is that the wild horse?\" asked Bull in his gentle voice. \"That's him.  I s'pose after seeing Tod handle him, you'll want to try to ride him  right off?\"    Bull looked in the direction in which the horse had disappeared. He  swallowed a lump that had risen in his throat and shook his  head sadly.    \"Nope. You see, I dunno nothing about horses, really.\"    The old man regarded him with a new and sudden interest.    \"Takes a wise man to call himself a fool,\" he declared axiomatically.    Bull took this dubious bit of praise as an invitation and came slowly  closer to the other. He had the child's way of eyeing a stranger with  embarrassing steadiness at a first meeting and thereafter paying  little attention to the face. He wrote the features down in his memory  and kept them at hand for reference, as it were. As he drew nearer,  the old man grew distinctly serious, and when Bull was directly before  him he gazed up into the face of Bull with distinct amazement. At a  distance the big man did not seem so large because of the grace of his  proportions; when he was directly confronted, however, he seemed a  veritable giant.    \"By the Lord, you _are_ big. And who might you be, stranger?\"    \"My name's Charlie Hunter; though mostly folks call me just plain  Bull.\"    \"That's queer,\" chuckled the other. \"Well, glad to know you. I'm  Bridewell.\"    They shook hands, and Bridewell noted the gentleness of the giant. As  a rule strong men are tempted to show their strength when they shake  hands; Bridewell appreciated the modesty of Charlie Hunter.    \"And you didn't come to ride Diablo?\"    \"No. I just stopped in to see him. And--\" Bull sighed profoundly.    \"I know. He gives even me a touch now and then, though I know what a  devil he is!\"    \"Devil?\" repeated Bull, astonished. \"Why, he's as gentle as a kitten!\"    \"Because you seen Tod ride him?\" Bridewell laughed. \"That don't mean  nothing. Tod can bully him, sure. But just let a grown man come near  him--with a saddle! That'll change things pretty pronto! You'll see  the finest little bit of boiled-down hell-raising that ever was! The  jingle of a pair of spurs is Diablo's idea of a drum--and he makes his  charge right off! Gentle?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#19)"],[1,"wife had got the nagging habit (as many Bushwomen have--God help 'em!),  and who wanted peace and quietness sometimes. Besides, other small  carriers started (seeing me getting on); and Tom Tarrant, the  coach-driver at Cudgeegong, had another heavy spring-van built, and put  it on the roads, and he took a lot of the light stuff.    The second year I made a rise--out of 'spuds', of all the things in the  world. It was Mary's idea. Down at the lower end of our selection--Mary  called it 'the run'--was a shallow watercourse called Snake's Creek, dry  most of the year, except for a muddy water-hole or two; and, just above  the junction, where it ran into Lahey's Creek, was a low piece of good  black-soil flat, on our side--about three acres. The flat was fairly  clear when I came to the selection--save for a few logs that had been  washed up there in some big 'old man' flood, way back in black-fellows'  times; and one day, when I had a spell at home, I got the horses and  trace-chains and dragged the logs together--those that wouldn't split  for fencing timber--and burnt them off. I had a notion to get the flat  ploughed and make a lucern-paddock of it. There was a good water-hole,  under a clump of she-oak in the bend, and Mary used to take her stools  and tubs and boiler down there in the spring-cart in hot weather, and  wash the clothes under the shade of the trees--it was cooler, and  saved carrying water to the house. And one evening after she'd done the  washing she said to me--    'Look here, Joe; the farmers out here never seem to get a new idea: they  don't seem to me ever to try and find out beforehand what the market is  going to be like--they just go on farming the same old way and putting  in the same old crops year after year. They sow wheat, and, if it comes  on anything like the thing, they reap and thresh it; if it doesn't,  they mow it for hay--and some of 'em don't have the brains to do that in  time. Now, I was looking at that bit of flat you cleared, and it struck  me that it wouldn't be a half bad idea to get a bag of seed-potatoes,  and have the land ploughed--old Corny George would do it cheap--and  get them put in at once. Potatoes have been dear all round for the last  couple of years.'    I told her she was talking nonsense, that the ground was no good for  potatoes, and the whole district was too dry. 'Everybody I know has  tried it, one time or another, and made nothing of it,' I said.    'All the more reason why you should try it, Joe,' said Mary. 'Just try  one crop. It might rain for weeks, and then you'll be sorry you didn't  take my advice.'    'But I tell you the ground is not potato-ground,' I said.    'How do you know? You haven't sown any there yet.'    'But I've turned up the surface and looked at it. It's not rich enough,  and too dry, I tell you. You need swampy, boggy ground for potatoes. Do  you think I don't know land when I see it?'    'But you haven't TRIED to grow potatoes there yet, Joe. How do you  know----'    I didn't listen to any more. Mary was obstinate when she got an idea  into her head. It was no use arguing with her. All the time I'd be  talking she'd just knit her forehead and go on thinking straight ahead,  on the track she'd started,--just as if I wasn't there,--and it used to  make me mad. She'd keep driving at me till I took her advice or lost my  temper,--I did both at the same time, mostly.    I took my pipe and went out to smoke and cool down.    A couple of days after the potato breeze, I started with the team down  to Cudgeegong for a load of fencing-wire I had to bring out; and after  I'd kissed Mary good-bye, she said--    'Look here, Joe, if you bring out a bag of seed-potatoes, James and I  will slice them, and old Corny George down the creek would bring his  plough up in the dray and plough the ground for very little. We could  put the potatoes in ourselves if the ground were only ploughed.'    I thought she'd forgotten all about it. There was no time to argue--I'd  be sure to lose my temper, and then I'd either have to waste an hour  comforting Mary or go off in a 'huff', as the women call it, and be  miserable for the trip. So I said I'd see about it. She gave me another  hug and a kiss. 'Don't forget, Joe,' she said as I started. 'Think it  over on the road.' I reckon she had the best of it that time.    About five miles along, just as I turned into the main road, I heard  some one galloping after me, and I saw young James on his hack. I got a  start, for I thought that something had gone wrong at home. I remember,  the first day I left Mary on the creek, for the first five or six miles  I was half-a-dozen times on the point of turning back--only I thought  she'd laugh at me.    'What is it, James?' I shouted, before he came up--but I saw he was  grinning.    'Mary says to tell you not to forget to bring a hoe out with you.'    'You clear off home!' I said, 'or I'll lay the whip about your young  hide; and don't come riding after me again as if the run was on fire.'    'Well, you needn't get shirty with me!' he said. '*I* don't want to have  anything to do with a hoe.' And he rode off.    I DID get thinking about those potatoes, though I hadn't meant to. I  knew of an independent man in that district who'd made his money out  of a crop of potatoes; but that was away back in the roaring  'Fifties--'54--when spuds went up to twenty-eight shillings a  hundredweight (in Sydney), on account of the gold rush. We might get  good rain now, and, anyway, it wouldn't cost much to put the potatoes  in. If they came on well, it would be a few pounds in my pocket; if the  crop was a failure, I'd have a better show with Mary next time she was  struck by an idea outside housekeeping, and have something to grumble  about when I felt grumpy.    I got a couple of bags of potatoes--we could use those that were  left over; and I got a small iron plough and a harrow that Little the  blacksmith had lying in his yard and let me have cheap--only about  a pound more than I told Mary I gave for them. When I took advice, I  generally made the mistake of taking more than was offered, or adding  notions of my own. It was vanity, I suppose. If the crop came on well I  could claim the plough-and-harrow part of the idea, anyway. (It didn't  strike me that if the crop failed Mary would have the plough and harrow  against me, for old Corny would plough the ground for ten or fifteen  shillings.) Anyway, I'd want a plough and harrow later on, and I might  as well get it now; it would give James something to do.    I came out by the western road, by Guntawang, and up the creek home; and  the first thing I saw was old Corny George ploughing the flat. And  Mary was down on the bank superintending. She'd got James with the  trace-chains and the spare horses, and had made him clear off every  stick and bush where another furrow might be squeezed in. Old Corny  looked pretty grumpy on it--he'd broken all his ploughshares but one, in  the roots; and James didn't look much brighter. Mary had an old felt  hat and a new pair of 'lastic-side boots of mine on, and the boots were  covered with clay, for she'd been down hustling James to get a rotten  old stump out of the way by the time Corny came round with his next  furrow.    'I thought I'd make the boots easy for you, Joe,' said Mary.    'It's all right, Mary,' I said. 'I'm not going to growl.' Those boots  were a bone of contention between us; but she generally got them off  before I got home.    Her face fell a little when she saw the plough and harrow in the waggon,  but I said that would be all right--we'd want a plough anyway.    'I thought you wanted old Corny to plough the ground,' she said.    'I never said so.'    'But when I sent Jim after you about the hoe to put the spuds in, you  didn't say you wouldn't bring it,' she said.    I had a few days at home, and entered into the spirit of the thing. When  Corny was done, James and I cross-ploughed the land, and got a stump or  two, a big log, and some scrub out of the way at the upper end and added  nearly an acre, and ploughed that. James was all right at most Bushwork:  he'd bullock so long as the novelty lasted; he liked ploughing or  fencing, or any graft he could make a show at. He didn't care for  grubbing out stumps, or splitting posts and rails. We sliced the  potatoes of an evening--and there was trouble between Mary and James  over cutting through the 'eyes'. There was no time for the hoe--and  besides it wasn't a novelty to James--so I just ran furrows and they  dropped the spuds in behind me, and I turned another furrow over them,  and ran the harrow over the ground. I think I hilled those spuds, too,  with furrows--or a crop of Indian corn I put in later on.    It rained heavens-hard for over a week: we had regular showers all  through, and it was the finest crop of potatoes ever seen in the  district. I believe at first Mary used to slip down at daybreak to see  if the potatoes were up; and she'd write to me about them, on the road.  I forget how many bags I got; but the few who had grown potatoes in the  district sent theirs to Sydney, and spuds went up to twelve and fifteen  shillings a hundredweight in that district. I made a few quid out of  mine--and saved carriage too, for I could take them out on the waggon.  Then Mary began to hear (through James) of a buggy that some one had for  sale cheap, or a dogcart that somebody else wanted to get rid of--and  let me know about it, in an offhand way.          II. Joe Wilson's Luck.      There was good grass on the selection all the year. I'd picked up  a small lot--about twenty head--of half-starved steers for next to  nothing, and turned them on the run; they came on wonderfully, and my  brother-in-law (Mary's sister's husband), who was running a butchery  at Gulgong, gave me a good price for them. His carts ran out twenty or  thirty miles, to little bits of gold-rushes that were going on at th'  Home Rule,"]]]
