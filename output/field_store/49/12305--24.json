And the villain offered to  her that if she would love him nought should harm her, saying he had power  to save her from the people; but that if she would not, she should go  before the court next day, and she might guess herself how it would fare  with her, seeing that he had many witnesses to prove that she had played  the wanton with Satan, and had suffered him to kiss her. Hereupon she was  silent, and only sobbed, which the arch-rogue took as a good sign, and  went on: \"If you have had Satan himself for a sweetheart, you surely may  love me.\" And he went to her and would have taken her in his arms, as I  perceived; for she gave a loud scream, and flew to the door; but he held  her fast, and begged and threatened as the devil prompted him. I was about  to go in when I heard her strike him in the face, saying, \"Get thee behind  me, Satan,\" so that he let her go. Whereupon she ran out at the door so  suddenly that she threw me on the ground, and fell upon me with a loud  cry. Hereat the Sheriff, who had followed her, started, but presently  cried out, \"Wait, thou prying parson, I will teach thee to listen!\" and  ran out and beckoned to the constable who stood on the steps below. He  bade him first shut me up in one dungeon, seeing that I was an  eavesdropper, and then return and thrust my child into another. But he  thought better of it when we had come halfway down the winding-stair, and  said he would excuse me this time, and that the constable might let me go,  and only lock up my child very fast, and bring the key to him, seeing she  was a stubborn person, as he had seen at the very first hearing which he  had given her.    Hereupon my poor child was torn from me, and I fell in a swound upon the  steps. I know not how I got down them; but when I came to myself, I was in  the constable his room, and his wife was throwing water in my face. There  I passed the night sitting in a chair, and sorrowed more than I prayed,  seeing that my faith was greatly shaken, and the Lord came not to  strengthen it.          _The Eighteenth Chapter_      OF THE FIRST TRIAL, AND WHAT CAME THEREOF    Next morning, as I walked up and down in the court, seeing that I had many  times asked the constable in vain to lead me to my child (he would not  even tell me where she lay), and for very disquietude I had at last begun  to wander about there; about six o'clock there came a coach from Uzdom,  wherein sat his worship, Master Samuel Pieper, _consul dirigens_, _item_,  the _camerarius_ Gebhard Wenzel, and a _scriba_, whose name, indeed, I  heard, but have forgotten it again; and my daughter forgot it too, albeit  in other things she has an excellent memory, and, indeed, told me most of  what follows, for my old head well-nigh burst, so that I myself could  remember but little. I straightway went up to the coach, and begged that  the worshipful court would suffer me to be present at the trial, seeing  that my daughter was yet in her nonage, but which the Sheriff, who  meanwhile had stepped up to the coach from the terrace, whence he had seen  all, had denied me. But his worship Master Samuel Pieper, who was a little  round man, with a fat paunch, and a beard mingled with grey hanging down  to his middle, reached me his hand, and condoled with me like a Christian  in my trouble: I might come into court in God's name; and he wished with  all his heart that all whereof my daughter was filed might prove to be  foul lies. Nevertheless I had still to wait two hours before their  worships came down the winding stair again. At last towards nine o'clock  I heard the constable moving about the chairs and benches in the  judgment-chamber; and as I conceived that the time was now come, I went in  and sat myself down on a bench. No one, however, was yet there, save the  constable and his young daughter, who was wiping the table, and held a  rosebud between her lips. I was fain to beg her to give it me, so that I  might have it to smell to; and I believe that I should have been carried  dead out of the room that day if I had not had it. God is thus able to  preserve our lives even by means of a poor flower, if so he wills it!    At length their worships came in and sat round the table, whereupon _Dom.  Consul_ motioned the constable to fetch in my child. Meanwhile he asked  the Sheriff whether he had put _Rea_ in chains, and when he said No, he  gave him such a reprimand that it went through my very marrow. But the  Sheriff excused himself, saying that he had not done so from regard to her  quality, but had locked her up in so fast a dungeon that she could not  possibly escape therefrom. Whereupon _Dom. Consul_ answered that much is  possible to the devil, and that they would have to answer for it should  _Rea_ escape. This angered the Sheriff, and he replied that if the devil  could convey her through walls seven feet thick, and through three doors,  he could very easily break her chains too. Whereupon _Dom. Consul_ said  that hereafter he would look at the prison himself; and I think that the  Sheriff had been so kind only because he yet hoped (as, indeed, will  hereafter be shown) to talk over my daughter to let him have his will of  her.    And now the door opened, and my poor child came in with the constable, but  walking backwards, and without her shoes, the which she was forced to  leave without. The fellow had seized her by her long hair, and thus  dragged her up to the table, when first she was to turn round and look  upon her judges. He had a vast deal to say in the matter, and was in every  way a bold and impudent rogue, as will soon be shown. After _Dom. Consul_  had heaved a deep sigh, and gazed at her from head to foot, he first asked  her her name, and how old she was; _item_, if she knew why she was  summoned before them? On the last point she answered that the Sheriff had  already told her father the reason; that she wished not to wrong any one,  but thought that the Sheriff himself had brought upon her the repute of a  witch, in order to gain her to his wicked will. Hereupon she told all his  ways with her, from the very first, and how he would by all means have had  her for his housekeeper; and that when she would not (although he had many  times come himself to her father his house), one day, as he went out of  the door, he had muttered in his beard, \"I will have her, despite of all!\"  which their servant Claus Neels had heard, as he stood in the stable; and  he had also sought to gain his ends by means of an ungodly woman, one  Lizzie Kolken, who had formerly been in his service; that this woman,  belike, had contrived the spells which they laid to her charge: she  herself knew nothing of witchcraft; _item_, she related what the Sheriff  had done to her the evening before, when she had just come, and when he  for the first time spoke out plainly, thinking that she was then  altogether in his power: nay, more, that he had come to her that very  night again, in her dungeon, and had made her the same offers, saying that  he would set her free if she would let him have his will of her; and that  when she denied him, he had struggled with her, whereupon she had screamed  aloud, and had scratched him across the nose, as might yet be seen,  whereupon he had left her; wherefore she would not acknowledge the Sheriff  as her judge, and trusted in God to save her from the hand of her enemies,  as of old he had saved the chaste Susannah.--    When she now held her peace amid loud sobs, _Dom. Consul_ started up after  he had looked, as we all did, at the Sheriff's nose, and had in truth  espied the scar upon it, and cried out in amaze, \"Speak, for God his sake,  speak, what is this that I hear of your lordship?\" Whereupon the Sheriff,  without changing colour, answered that although, indeed, he was not called  upon to say anything to their worships, seeing that he was the head of the  court, and that _Rea_, as appeared from numberless _indicia_, was a wicked  witch, and therefore could not bear witness against him or any one else;  he, nevertheless, would speak, so as to give no cause of scandal to the  court; that all the charges brought against him by this person were foul  lies; it was, indeed, true, that he would have hired her for a  housekeeper, whereof he stood greatly in need, seeing that his old Dorothy  was already growing infirm; it was also true that he had yesterday  questioned her in private, hoping to get her to confess by fair means,  whereby her sentence would be softened, inasmuch as he had pity on her  great youth; but that he had not said one naughty word to her, nor had he  been to her in the night; and that it was his little lap-dog, called  Below, which had scratched him, while he played with it that very morning;  that his old Dorothy could bear witness to this, and that the cunning  witch had only made use of this wile to divide the court against itself,  thereby and with the devil's help, to gain her own advantage, inasmuch as  she was a most cunning creature, as the court would soon find out.    Hereupon I plucked up a heart, and declared that all my daughter had said  was true, and that the evening before I myself had heard, through the  door, how his lordship had made offers to her, and would have done  wantonness with her; _item_, that he had already sought to kiss her once  at Coserow; _item_, the troubles which his lordship had formerly brought  upon me in the matter of the first-fruits.    Howbeit the Sheriff presently talked me down, saying, that if I had  slandered him, an innocent man, in church, from the pulpit, as the whole  congregation could bear witness, I should doubtless find it easy to do as  much here, before the court; not to mention that a father could, in no  case, be a witness for his own child.    But _Dom. Consul_ seemed quite confounded, and was silent, and leaned his  head on the table, as in deep thought. Meanwhile the impudent constable  began to finger his beard from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#18)"],[1,"ck, but they  soon learnt that it was far more convenient than to be shut up  within massive walls, and the present dwellings are much larger and  more comfortable than those of former days. The duke said rightly  that the abolition of fortresses well-nigh doubled his fighting  power, for that so many men were required to garrison them as to  greatly diminish the number their lords could take with them into  the field. You do not have castles in England, do you?\"    \"No, we live in open houses, and hold that it is far better and  more pleasant to do so. There is no fighting between neighbours  with us. The great earls may quarrel and lead their forces into the  field, or may gather them against Danish and Norwegian pirates, but  except on these occasions, which are rare, all dwell peaceably in  their homes.\"    The horses were fresh, and the five miles quickly passed over.    \"There is the house,\" De Burg said, pointing to a large building  standing on an eminence. It was castellated in form, and much of  the old building had been incorporated with the additions, but the  outer wall had been pulled down and the moat filled up. Broad  casements had replaced the narrow loopholes, and though the flag  of the De Burgs still waved over the keep, which stood a little  apart from the rest, the family no longer dwelt in it.    \"It is chiefly used as a storehouse now,\" Guy De Burg explained;  \"but there, as you see, the old loopholes still remain, and in case  of trouble it might be held for a time. But of that, however, there  is little chance; the duke's hand is a heavy one, and he has shown  himself a great leader. He has raised Normandy well-nigh level with  France, and so long as he lives and reigns there is no fear of  domestic trouble.\"    The gate stood open and they rode into a courtyard, when several  men came out and took the horses. Guy de Burg ran up a broad staircase  to the entrance of the house itself, and passed beneath a noble  entrance with a lofty pointed arch supported by clustered pillars.  Inside was a spacious hall paved with stone, and from this De Burg  turned into an apartment whose walls were covered with rich hangings.  Here a lady was at work embroidering, surrounded by several of her  maids similarly engaged. A girl some fourteen years old was reading  a missal, while the master of the castle was sitting in a chair  with low arms, and was playing with the ears of a hound whose head  was lying on his knee.    \"Well, Guy, what is your news?\" he asked as his son entered. \"Half  an hour since I received a message from the duke desiring me to  appear with ten men-at-arms in their best trappings to ride with  him to Eu. Is Conrad of Ponthieu giving trouble again, and who are  these young gentlemen with you?\"    Guy went down on one knee to kiss his father's hand, and then did  the same to his mother, then he said, \"I will with your permission  answer the last question first, father. My friends are young Saxon  thanes, pages to Earl Harold, and at present guests of the duke.\"    \"You are bearers, doubtless, of some message from the king to our  duke?\"    \"No, my lord,\" Beorn said, \"we were bearers of a message from Earl  Harold.\"    \"It is to meet him, father, that we are to ride to Eu to-morrow.  He has been wrecked on the shores of Ponthieu, and has been foully  imprisoned and even fettered by Count Conrad. Beorn and Wulf escaped  from the prison and brought the news to the duke, who this afternoon  dispatched Fitz-Osberne and Warren at full speed to bid the count  at once free his prisoners, and deliver them over to him at Eu under  pain of his direst displeasure.\"    \"Harold in Normandy and a prisoner! This is strange news indeed.  We shall surely make him welcome, for he is in all respects a great  man, and save our own duke has a reputation second to none in  Europe.\"    Wulf thought as he looked at the speaker that at least he had no  second thought in his mind. It was a frank honest face, martial in  its outline, but softened by a pleasant smile.    He had spoken in a genial tone of affection to his son, and Wulf  thought, that although no doubt he was ready to take the field at  the summons of his lord, he preferred a quiet life in this stately  home.    \"This is news for you, wife,\" he went on. \"You will have to furbish  up your gayest attire, for we shall be having grand doings in honour  of this great English earl, and our dames will have to look their  best in order that he may carry home a fair report of them to the  Saxon ladies. And how did you manage to escape, young sirs, and  when did you arrive with the news?\"    Beorn, who as the elder was specially addressed, shortly related  the story of their escape and journey.    \"You have done well,\" the baron said when he had concluded. \"Guy,  you may learn from these young Saxons that even pages may be called  upon to do work of more importance than handing wine-cups and  standing behind their lord on state occasions. Had it not been for  their readiness and courage Harold might have lain weeks in prison,  maybe months, while the count was striving to wring the utmost  ransom from him. The lads would doubtless have been slain had they  been detected in making their escape or overtaken on the way, and  the attempt was therefore one that required courage as well as  devotion to their lord. I doubt not that you would exhibit both  qualities did opportunity offer, but I question whether you could  have walked the distance they did, and that on such scanty fare.  We Normans are too apt to trust wholly to our horses' legs to the  neglect of our own, and although I have no doubt that you could  ride as far as a horse could carry you, I warrant that you could  hardly have performed on foot the journey from Beaurain in twice  the time in which they did it. They must have exercised their legs  as well as their arms, and although in a campaign a Norman noble  depends upon his war horse both on the march and on the day of  battle, there may often be times when it is well that a knight  should be able to march as far as any of the footmen in the army.  Well, Agnes, and what have you to say to these Saxon youths? Methinks  your eyes are paying more attention to them than to your missal.\"    \"I can read my missal at any hour, father, but this is the first  time that I have seen young Saxon nobles. I thought there would  have been more difference between them and us. Their hair is fairer  and more golden and their eyes bluer, but their dress differs in  no way from our own.\" She spoke in a matter-of-fact and serious  air, as if it were a horse or a dog that she was commenting upon,  and both Beorn and Wulf smiled, while Guy laughed outright.    \"It is little wonder that their attire is like ours, Agnes,\" he  said, \"seeing that they were furnished with it by the duke's orders.  You do not suppose that after being tossed about on the sea and  well-nigh drowned in landing, and being made prisoners, and then  travelling through the country and sleeping in the woods, Beorn and  Wulf would arrive here with their garments new and spotless. That  would indeed have been a miracle.\"    \"But, indeed,\" Beorn said, \"our garments differ not greatly from  those we now have on, for Norman fashions are prevalent at King  Edward's court, and we had no choice but to conform to them. Your  language is always spoken there, and methinks that were you to visit  Westminster you would see but little difference between King Edward's  court and that of your own duke.\"    \"And your sisters, do they too dress like us?\"    \"Queen Edith's ladies dress like her in Norman fashion, but away  from the court the attire is different and more simple. Sisters,  Wulf and I have none; we are orphans both, and wards of Earl Harold,  who holds our estates until we are of age to take the oaths to him  and to lead our men in battle.\"    \"And will you be barons like my father, or counts, or simple knights?\"    \"We shall be none of these things, Lady Agnes. We have our great  earls as in France you have your great dukes, but below that we  have no titles. We are thanes, that is land owners, who hold their  land direct from our earls. Some have wider lands than others, but  as free thanes we are all equal. As to knights, we have not in  England the titles and ceremonies which are so much thought of in  France and in other courts.\"    \"That is a pity,\" the girl said gravely, \"for the vows of knighthood  make a knight courteous and gentle to enemies and friends alike.\"    \"Or rather, Agnes,\" her mother put in, \"they should do so; but in  truth, looking round at the cruel wars we have had in Normandy, I  do not see that men have been more gentle or courteous than they  would have been had they never taken the vows or had knightly spurs  buckled on; and in truth it seems to me from the news of what has  taken place beyond the sea, that in the civil troubles they have  had in England men are much more gentle with each other, and foes  are far more easily reconciled than with us in Normandy, who are  supposed to be bound by the laws of chivalry. Had our duke been  cast upon the shores of England as Harold has been cast upon that  of Ponthieu, I think that he would not have been so dishonourably  treated by one of the English thanes as Harold has been by Count  Conrad. When Godwin and his sons returned from the exile into which  they had been driven, and again became all powerful, there was not,  as I have heard from your father, a single drop of blood shed, nor  any vengeance taken upon the men who had brought about their exile.  It would have been very different had such things happened here.\"    \"You speak rightly, wife. The English are of a more gentle disposition  than we are, though nowise backward in battle. But now, Guy, it  is time that you were returning. You have already made a longer  stay than usual. I shall see you again to-morrow when we start for  Eu. Young sirs, I hope that on your"]]]
