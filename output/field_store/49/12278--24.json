It behoveth thee to forgive me and revoke thy curse.\" And seeing  me sorely troubled, the ascetic was moved, and he replied, breathing hot  and hard. \"What I have said must come to pass. Listen to what I say and  lay it to thy heart. O pious one! when Ruru the pure son of Pramati, will  appear, thou shall be delivered from the curse the moment thou seest him.\"  Thou art the very Ruru and the son of Pramati. On regaining my native form,  I will tell thee something for thy good.'    \"And that illustrious man and the best of Brahmanas then left his snake-  body, and attained his own form and original brightness. He then addressed  the following words to Ruru of incomparable power, 'O thou first of  created beings, verily the highest virtue of man is sparing the life of  others. Therefore a Brahmana should never take the life of any creature. A  Brahmana should ever be mild. This is the most sacred injunction of the  Vedas. A Brahmana should be versed in the Vedas and Vedangas, and should  inspire all creatures with belief in God. He should be benevolent to all  creatures, truthful, and forgiving, even as it is his paramount duty to  retain the Vedas in his memory. The duties of the Kshatriya are not thine.  To be stern, to wield the sceptre and to rule the subjects properly are  the duties of the Kshatriya. Listen, O Ruru, to the account of the  destruction of snakes at the sacrifice of Janamejaya in days of yore, and  the deliverance of the terrified reptiles by that best of Dwijas, Astika,  profound in Vedic lore and might in spiritual energy.'\"    And so ends the eleventh section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XII    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti continued, \"Ruru then asked, 'O best of Dwijas, why was king  Janamejaya bent upon destroying the serpents?--And why and how were they  saved by the wise Astika? I am anxious to hear all this in detail.'    \"The Rishi replied, 'O Ruru, the important history of Astika you will  learn from the lips of Brahmanas.' Saying this, he vanished.\"    Sauti continued, \"Ruru ran about in search of the missing Rishi, and  having failed to find him in all the woods, fell down on the ground,  fatigued. And revolving in his mind the words of the Rishi, he was greatly  confounded and seemed to be deprived of his senses. Regaining  consciousness, he came home and asked his father to relate the history in  question. Thus asked, his father related all about the story.\"    So ends the twelfth section in the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XIII    (Astika Parva)    Saunaka said, \"For what reason did that tiger among kings, the royal  Janamejaya, determine to take the lives of the snakes by means of a  sacrifice? O Sauti, tell us in full the true story. Tell us also why  Astika, that best of regenerate ones, that foremost of ascetics, rescued  the snakes from the blazing fire. Whose son was that monarch who  celebrated the snake-sacrifice? And whose son also was that best of  regenerate ones?\"    Sauti said, \"O best of speakers, this story of Astika is long. I will  duly relate it in full, O listen!\"    Saunaka said, \"I am desirous of hearing at length the charming story of  that Rishi, that illustrious Brahmana named Astika.\"    Sauti said, \"This history (first) recited by Krishna-Dwaipayana, is  called a Purana by the Brahmanas. It was formerly narrated by my wise  father, Lomaharshana, the disciple of Vyasa, before the dwellers of the  Naimisha forest, at their request. I was present at the recital, and, O  Saunaka, since thou askest me, I shall narrate the history of Astika  exactly as I heard it. O listen, as I recite in full that sin-destroying  story.    \"The father of Astika was powerful like Prajapati. He was a Brahmacharin,  always engaged in austere devotions. He ate sparingly, was a great ascetic,  and had his lust under complete control. And he was known by the name of  Jaratkaru. That foremost one among the Yayavaras, virtuous and of rigid  vows, highly blessed and endued with great ascetic power, once undertook a  journey over the world. He visited diverse places, bathed in diverse  sacred waters, and rested where night overtook him. Endued with great  energy, he practised religious austerities, hard to be practised by men of  unrestrained souls. The sage lived upon air only, and renounced sleep for  ever. Thus going about like a blazing fire, one day he happened to see his  ancestors, hanging heads down in a great hole, their feet pointing upwards.  On seeing them, Jaratkaru addressed them, saying:    \"'Who are you thus hanging heads down in this hole by a rope of virana  fibres that is again secretly eaten into on all sides by a rat living  here?'    \"The ancestors said, 'We are Rishis of rigid vows, called Yayavaras. We  are sinking low into the earth for want of offspring. We have a son named  Jaratkaru. Woe to us! That wretch hath entered upon a life of austerities  only! The fool doth not think of raising offspring by marriage! It is for  that reason, viz., the fear of extinction of our race, that we are  suspended in this hole. Possessed of means, we fare like unfortunates that  have none! O excellent one, who art thou that thus sorrowest as a friend  on our account? We desire to learn, O Brahmana, who thou art that standest  by us, and why, O best of men, thou sorrowest for us that are so  unfortunate.'    \"Jaratkaru said, 'Ye are even my sires and grandsires; I am that Jaratkaru!  O, tell me, how I may serve you.'    \"The fathers then answered, 'Try thy best, O child, to beget a son to  extend our line. Thou wilt then, O excellent one, have done a meritorious  act for both thyself and us. Not by the fruits of virtue, not by ascetic  penances well hoarded up, acquireth the merit which one doth by becoming a  father. Therefore, O child, by our command, set thy heart upon marriage  and offspring. Even this is our highest good.'    \"Jaratkaru replied, 'I shall not marry for my sake, nor shall I earn  wealth for enjoyment, but I shall do so for your welfare only. According  to this understanding, I shall, agreeably to the Sastric ordinance, take a  wife for attaining the end. I shall not act otherwise. If a bride may be  had of the same name with me, whose friends would, besides, willingly give  her to me as a gift in charity, I shall wed her duly. But who will give  his daughter to a poor man like me for wife. I shall, however, accept any  daughter given to me as alms. I shall endeavour, ye sires, even thus to  wed a girl! Having given my word, I will not act otherwise. Upon her I  will raise offspring for your redemption, so that, ye fathers, ye may  attain to eternal regions (of bliss) and may rejoice as ye like.'\"    So ends the thirteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XIV    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"That Brahmana of rigid vows then wandered over the earth for  a wife but a wife found he not. One day he went into the forest, and  recollecting the words of his ancestors, he thrice prayed in a faint voice  for a bride. Thereupon Vasuki rose and offered his sister for the Rishi's  acceptance. But the Brahmana hesitated to accept her, thinking her not to  be of the same name with himself. The high-souled Jaratkaru thought within  himself, 'I will take none for wife who is not of the same name with  myself.' Then that Rishi of great wisdom and austere penances asked him,  saying, 'Tell me truly what is the name of this thy sister, O snake.'    \"Vasuki replied, 'O Jaratkaru, this my younger sister is called Jaratkaru.  Given away by me, accept this slender-waisted damsel for thy spouse. O  best of Brahmanas, for thee I reserved her. Therefore, take her.' Saying  this, he offered his beautiful sister to Jaratkaru who then espoused her  with ordained rites.\"    So ends the thirteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XV    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"O foremost of persons acquainted with Brahma, the mother of  the snakes had cursed them of old, saying, 'He that hath the Wind for his  charioteer (viz., Agni) shall burn you all in Janamejaya's sacrifice!' It  was to neutralise that curse that the chief of the snakes married his  sister to that high-souled Rishi of excellent vows. The Rishi wedded her  according to the rites ordained (in the scriptures), and from them was  born a high-souled son called Astika. An illustrious ascetic, versed in  the Vedas and their branches, he regarded all with an even eye, and  removed the fears of both his parents.    \"Then, after a long space of time, a king descending from the Pandava line  celebrated a great sacrifice known as the Snake-sacrifice. After that  sacrifice had commenced for the destruction of the snakes, Astika  delivered the Nagas, viz., his brothers and maternal uncles and other  snakes (from a fiery death). And he delivered his fathers also by  begetting offspring. And by his austerities, O Brahmana, and various vows  and study of the Vedas, he freed himself from all his debts. By sacrifices,  at which various kinds of offerings were made, he propitiated the gods. By  practising the Brahmacharya mode of life he conciliated the Rishis; and by  begetting offspring he gratified his ancestors.    \"Thus Jaratkaru of rigid vows discharged the heavy debt he owed to his  sires who being thus relieved from bondage ascended to heaven. Thus having  acquired great religious merit, Jaratkaru, after a long course of years,  went to heaven, leaving Astika behind. There is the story of Astika that I  have related duly. Now, tell me, O tiger of Bhrigu's race, what else I  shall narrate.\"    So ends the fifteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XVI    (Astika Parva continued)    Saunaka said, \"O Sauti, relate once more in detail this history of the  learned and virtuous Astika. Our curiosity for hearing it is great.

In the middle of its tail, also,  thick ringlets, several inches long, were growing. Evidently, the hair  tonic had done some good. So this one became the father of all the  curly-tailed lions in the Netherlands. Not only was this lion, thus  distinguished for so novel an ornament, copied into heraldry, but it  adorned many city seals and town arms. In time, the lion of the  Netherlands was pictured with a crown on its head, a sword in its right  hand, a bundle of seven arrows--in token of a union of seven  states--and, still later, the new Order of the Netherlands Lion was  founded. The original curly lion, with long hair in the middle of its  tail, boasts of a long line of descendants that are proud of their  ancestor.          BRABO AND THE GIANT      Ages ago, when the giants were numerous on the earth, there lived a big  fellow named Antigonus. That was not what his mother had called him, but  some one told him of a Greek general of that name; so he took this for  his own. He was rough and cruel. His castle was on the Scheldt River,  where the city of Antwerp now stands. Many ships sailed out of France  and Holland, down this stream. They were loaded with timber, flax, iron,  cheese, fish, bread, linen, and other things made in the country. It was  by this trade that many merchants grew rich, and their children had  plenty of toys to play with. The river was very grand, deep, and wide.  The captains of the ships liked to sail on it, because there was no  danger from rocks, and the country through which it flowed was so  pretty.    So every day, one could see hundreds of white-sailed craft moving  towards the sea, or coming in from the ocean. Boys and girls came down  to stand in their wooden shoes on the banks, to see the vessels moving  to and fro. The incoming ships brought sugar, wine, oranges, lemons,  olives and other good things to eat, and wool to make warm clothes.  Often craftsmen came from the wonderful countries in the south to tell  of the rich cities there, and help to build new and fine houses, and  splendid churches, and town halls. So all the Belgian people were happy.    But one day, this wicked giant came into the country to stop the ships  and make them pay him money. He reared a strong castle on the river  banks. It had four sides and high walls, and deep down in the earth were  dark, damp dungeons. One had to light a candle to find his way to the  horrid places.    What was it all for? The people wondered, but they soon found out. The  giant, with a big knotted club, made out of an oak tree, strode through  the town. He cried out to all the people to assemble in the great open  square.    \"From this day forth,\" he roared, \"no ship, whether up or down the  river, shall pass by this place, without my permission. Every captain  must pay me toll, in money or goods. Whoever refuses, shall have both  his hands cut off and thrown into the river.    \"Hear ye all and obey. Any one caught in helping a ship go by without  paying toll, whether it be night, or whether it be day, shall have his  thumbs cut off and be put in the dark dungeon for a month. Again I say,  Obey!\"    With this, the giant swung and twirled his club aloft and then brought  it down on a poor countryman's cart, smashing it into flinders. This was  done to show his strength.    So every day, when the ships hove in sight, they were hailed from the  giant's castle and made to pay heavy toll. Poor or rich, they had to  hand over their money. If any captain refused, he was brought ashore and  made to kneel before a block and place one hand upon the other. Then the  giant swung his axe and cut off both hands, and flung them into the  river. If a ship master hesitated, because he had no money, he was cast  into a dungeon, until his friends paid his ransom.    Soon, on account of this, the city got a bad name. The captains from  France kept in, and the ship men from Spain kept out. The merchants  found their trade dwindling, and they grew poorer every day. So some of  them slipped out of the city and tried to get the ships to sail in the  night, and silently pass the giant's castle.    But the giant's watchers, on the towers, were as wide awake as owls and  greedy as hawks. They pounced on the ship captains, chopped off their  hands and tossed them into the river. The townspeople, who were found on  board, were thrown into the dungeons and had their thumbs cut off.    So the prosperity of the city was destroyed, for the foreign merchants  were afraid to send their ships into the giant's country. The reputation  of the city grew worse. It was nicknamed by the Germans Hand Werpen, or  Hand Throwing; while the Dutchmen called it Antwerp, which meant the  same thing. The Duke of Brabant, or Lord of the land, came to the big  fellow's fortress and told him to stop. He even shook his fist under the  giant's huge nose, and threatened to attack his castle and burn it. But  Antigonus only snapped his fingers, and laughed at him. He made his  castle still stronger and kept on hailing ships, throwing some of the  crews into dungeons and cutting off the hands of the captains, until the  fish in the river grew fat.    Now there was a brave young fellow named Brabo, who lived in the  province of Brabant. He was proud of his country and her flag of yellow,  black and red, and was loyal to his lord. He studied the castle well and  saw a window, where he could climb up into the giant's chamber.    Going to the Duke, Brabo promised if his lord's soldiers would storm the  gates of the giant's castle, that he would seek out and fight the  ruffian. While they battered down the gates, he would climb the walls.  \"He's nothing but a 'bulle-wak'\" (a bully and a boaster), said Brabo,  \"and we ought to call him that, instead of Antigonus.\"    The Duke agreed. On a dark night, one thousand of his best men-at-arms  were marched with their banners, but with no drums or trumpets, or  anything that could make a noise and alarm the watchmen.    Reaching a wood full of big trees near the castle, they waited till  after midnight. All the dogs in the town and country, for five miles  around, were seized and put into barns, so as not to bark and wake the  giant up. They were given plenty to eat, so that they quickly fell  asleep and were perfectly quiet.    At the given signal, hundreds of men holding ship's masts, or tree  trunks, marched against the gates. They punched and pounded and at last  smashed the iron-bound timbers and rushed in. After overcoming the  garrison, they lighted candles, and unlocking the dungeons, went down  and set the poor half-starved captives free. Some of them pale, haggard  and thin as hop poles, could hardly stand. About the same time, the barn  doors where the dogs had been kept, were thrown open. In full cry, a  regiment of the animals, from puppies to hounds, were at once out,  barking, baying, and yelping, as if they knew what was going on and  wanted to see the fun.    But where was the giant? None of the captains could find him. Not one of  the prisoners or the garrison could tell where he had hid.    But Brabo knew that the big fellow, Antigonus, was not at all brave, but  really only a bully and a coward. So the lad was not afraid. Some of his  comrades outside helped him to set up a tall ladder against the wall.  Then, while all the watchers and men-at-arms inside, had gone away to  defend the gates, Brabo climbed into the castle, through a slit in the  thick wall. This had been cut out, like a window, for the bow-and-arrow  men, and was usually occupied by a sentinel. Sword in hand, Brabo made  for the giant's own room. Glaring at the youth, the big fellow seized  his club and brought it down with such force that it went through the  wooden floor. But Brabo dodged the blow and, in a trice, made a sweep  with his sword. Cutting off the giant's head, he threw it out the  window. It had hardly touched the ground, before the dogs arrived. One  of the largest of these ran away with the trophy and the big, hairy  noddle of the bully was never found again.    But the giant's huge hands! Ah, they were cut off by Brabo, who stood on  the very top of the highest tower, while all below looked up and  cheered. Brabo laid one big hand on top of the other, as the giant used  to do, when he cut off the hands of captains. He took first the right  hand and then the left hand and threw them, one at a time, into the  river.    A pretty sight now revealed the fact that the people knew what had been  going on and were proud of Brabo's valor. In a moment, every house in  Antwerp showed lighted candles, and the city was illuminated. Issuing  from the gates came a company of maidens. They were dressed in white,  but their leader was robed in yellow, red, and black, the colors of the  Brabant flag. They all sang in chorus the praises of Brabo their hero.    \"Let us now drop the term of disgrace to the city--that of the  Hand-Throwing and give it a new name,\" said one of the leading men of  Antwerp.    \"No,\" said the chief ruler, \"let us rather keep the name, and, more than  ever, invite all peaceful ships to come again, 'an-'t-werf' (at the  wharf), as of old. Then, let the arms of Antwerp be two red hands above  a castle.\"    \"Agreed,\" cried the citizens with a great shout. The Duke of Brabant  approved and gave new privileges to the city, on account of Brabo's  bravery. So, from high to low, all rejoiced to honor their hero, who  was richly rewarded.    After this, thousands of ships, from many countries, loaded or unloaded  their cargoes on the wharves, or sailed peacefully by. Antwerp excelled  all seaports and became very rich again. Her people loved their native  city so dearly, that they coined the proverb \"All the world is a ring,  and Antwerp is the pearl set in it.\"    To this day,"]]]
