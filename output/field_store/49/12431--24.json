Swiftly the Indian  knelt on the stallion's head; his hands flashed; there was a scream, a  click of steel on bone; and proud Silvermane jumped to his feet with a  bit between his teeth.    The Navajo, firmly in the saddle, rose with him, and Silvermane leaped  through the corral gate, and out upon the stretch, lengthening out with  every stride, and settling into a wild, despairing burst of speed. The  white mane waved in the wind; the half-naked Navajo swayed to the  motion. Horse and rider disappeared in the cedars.    They were gone all day. Toward night they appeared on the stretch. The  Indian rode into camp and, dismounting, handed the bridle-rein to Naab.  He spoke no word; his dark impassiveness invited no comment. Silvermane  was dust-covered and sweat-stained. His silver crest had the same proud  beauty, his neck still the splendid arch, his head the noble outline,  but his was a broken spirit.    \"Here, my lad,\" said August Naab, throwing the bridle-rein over Hare's  arm. \"What did I say once about seeing you on a great gray horse? Ah!  Well, take him and know this: you've the swiftest horse in this desert  country.\"              IX. THE SCENT OF DESERT-WATER    SOON the shepherds were left to a quiet unbroken by the whistle of wild  mustangs, the whoop of hunters, the ring of iron-shod hoofs on the  stones. The scream of an eagle, the bleating of sheep, the bark of a  coyote were once more the only familiar sounds accentuating the silence  of the plateau. For Hare, time seemed to stand still. He thought but  little; his whole life was a matter of feeling from without. He rose at  dawn, never failing to see the red sun tip the eastern crags; he glowed  with the touch of cold spring-water and the morning air; he trailed  Silvermane under the cedars and thrilled when the stallion, answering  his call, thumped the ground with hobbled feet and came his way,  learning day by day to be glad at sight of his master. He rode with  Mescal behind the flock; he hunted hour by hour, crawling over the  fragrant brown mats of cedar, through the sage and juniper, up the  grassy slopes. He rode back to camp beside Mescal, drove the sheep, and  put Silvermane to his fleetest to beat Black Bolly down the level  stretch where once the gray, even with freedom at stake, had lost to the  black. Then back to camp and fire and curling blue smoke, a supper that  testified to busy Piute's farmward trips, sunset on the rim, endless  changing desert, the wind in the cedars, bright stars in the blue, and  sleep--so time stood still.    Mescal and Hare were together, or never far apart, from dawn to night.  Until the sheep were in the corral, every moment had its duty, from  camp-work and care of horses to the many problems of the flock, so that  they earned the rest on the rim-wall at sundown. Only a touch of hands  bridged the chasm between them. They never spoke of their love, of  Mescal's future, of Jack's return to hearth; a glance and a smile,  scarcely sad yet not altogether happy, was the substance of their dream.  Where Jack had once talked about the canyon and desert, he now seldom  spoke at all. From watching Mescal he had learned that to see was  enough. But there were moments when some association recalled the past  and the strangeness of the present faced him. Then he was wont to  question Mescal.    \"What are you thinking of?\" he asked, curiously, interrupting their  silence. She leaned against the rocks and kept a changeless, tranquil,  unseeing gaze on the desert. The level eyes were full of thought, of  sadness, of mystery; they seemed to look afar.    Then she turned to him with puzzled questioning look and enigmatical  reply. \"Thinking?\" asked her eyes. \"I wasn't thinking,\" were her words.    \"I fancied--I don't know exactly what,\" he went on. \"You looked so  earnest. Do you ever think of going to the Navajos?\"    \"No.\"    \"Or across that Painted Desert to find some place you seem to know, or  see?\"    \"No.\"    \"I don't know why, but, Mescal, sometimes I have the queerest ideas when  I catch your eyes watching, watching. You look at once happy and sad.  You see something out there that I can't see. Your eyes are haunted.  I've a feeling that if I'd look into them I'd see the sun setting, the  clouds coloring, the twilight shadows changing; and then back of that  the secret of it all--of you--Oh! I can't explain, but it seems so.\"    \"I never had a secret, except the one you know,\" she answered. \"You ask  me so often what I think about, and you always ask me when we're here.\"  She was silent for a pause. \"I don't think at all till you make me. It's  beautiful out there. But that's not what it is to me. I can't tell you.  When I sit down here all within me is--is somehow stilled. I watch--and  it's different from what it is now, since you've made me think. Then I  watch, and I see, that's all.\"    It came to Hare afterward with a little start of surprise that Mescal's  purposeless, yet all-satisfying, watchful gaze had come to be part of  his own experience. It was inscrutable to him, but he got from it a  fancy, which he tried in vain to dispel, that something would happen to  them out there on the desert.    And then he realized that when they returned to the camp-fire they  seemed freed from this spell of the desert. The blaze-lit circle was  shut in by the darkness; and the immensity of their wild environment,  because for the hour it could not be seen, lost its paralyzing effect.  Hare fell naturally into a talkative mood. Mescal had developed a  vivacity, an ambition which contrasted strongly with her silent moods;  she became alive and curious, human like the girls he had known in the  East, and she fascinated him the more for this complexity.    The July rains did not come; the mists failed; the dews no longer  freshened the grass, and the hot sun began to tell on shepherds and  sheep. Both sought the shade. The flowers withered first--all the blue-  bells and lavender patches of primrose, and pale-yellow lilies, and  white thistle-blossoms. Only the deep magenta of cactus and vermilion of  Indian paint-brush, flowers of the sun, survived the heat. Day by day  the shepherds scanned the sky for storm-clouds that did not appear. The  spring ran lower and lower. At last the ditch that carried water to the  corral went dry, and the margin of the pool began to retreat. Then  Mescal sent Piute down for August Naab.    He arrived at the plateau the next day with Dave and at once ordered the  breaking up of camp.    \"It will rain some time,\" he said, \"but we can't wait any longer. Dave,  when did you last see the Blue Star waterhole?\"    \"On the trip in from Silver Cup, ten days ago. The waterhole was full  then.\"    \"Will there be water enough now?\"    \"We've got to chance it. There's no water here, and no springs on the  upper range where we can drive sheep; we've got to go round under the  Star.\"    \"That's so,\" replied August. His fears needed confirmation, because his  hopes always influenced his judgment till no hope was left. \"I wish I  had brought Zeke and George. It'll be a hard drive, though we've got  Jack and Mescal to help.\"    Hot as it was August Naab lost no time in the start. Piute led the train  on foot, and the flock, used to following him, got under way readily.  Dave and Mescal rode along the sides, and August with Jack came behind,  with the pack-burros bringing up the rear. Wolf circled them all,  keeping the flanks close in, heading the lambs that strayed, and, ever  vigilant, made the drive orderly and rapid.    The trail to the upper range was wide and easy of ascent, the first of  it winding under crags, the latter part climbing long slopes. It forked  before the summit, where dark pine trees showed against the sky, one  fork ascending, the other, which Piute took, beginning to go down. It  admitted of no extended view, being shut in for the most part on the  left, but there were times when Hare could see a curving stream of sheep  on half a mile of descending trail. Once started down the flock could  not be stopped, that was as plain as Piute's hard task. There were times  when Hare could have tossed a pebble on the Indian just below him, yet  there were more than three thousand sheep, strung out in line between  them. Clouds of dust rolled up, sheets of gravel and shale rattled down  the inclines, the clatter, clatter, clatter of little hoofs, the steady  baa-baa-baa filled the air. Save for the crowding of lambs off the  trail, and a jamming of sheep in the corners, the drive went on without  mishap. Hare was glad to see the lambs scramble back bleating for their  mothers, and to note that, though peril threatened at every steep turn,  the steady down-flow always made space for the sheep behind. He was  glad, too, when through a wide break ahead his eye followed the face of  a vast cliff down to the red ground below, and he knew the flock would  soon be safe on the level.    A blast as from a furnace smote Hare from this open break in the wall.  The air was dust-laden, and carried besides the smell of dust and the  warm breath of desert growths, a dank odor that was unpleasant.    The sheep massed in a flock on the level, and the drivers spread to  their places. The route lay under projecting red cliffs, between the  base and enormous sections of wall that had broken off and fallen far  out. There was no weathering slope; the wind had carried away the  smaller stones and particles, and had cut the huge pieces of pinnacle  and tower into hollowed forms. This zone of rim merged into another of  strange contrast, the sloping red stream of sand which flowed from the  wall of the canyon.    Piute swung the flock up to the left into an amphitheatre, and there  halted. The sheep formed a densely packed mass in the curve of the wall.  Dave Naab galloped back toward August and Hare, and before he reached  them shouted out: \"The waterhole's plugged!\"    \"What?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#19)"],[1,"in her brooding bosom for uncounted  centuries, until, by the operation of the law of cycles, the time  should come for the giving of it to the West.    This secret is Yoga, the method of self-development whereby the seeker  for union is enabled to perceive the shining of the Inward Light. This  is achieved by daily discipline in stilling the mind and directing the  consciousness inward instead of outward. The Self is within, and  the mind, which is normally centrifugal, must first be arrested,  controlled, and then turned back upon itself, and held with perfect  steadiness. All this is naively expressed in the Upanishads in the  passage, \"The Self-existent pierced the openings of the senses so that  they turn forward, not backward into himself. Some wise man, however,  with eyes closed and wishing for immortality, saw the Self behind.\"  This stilling of the mind, its subjugation and control whereby it may  be concentrated on anything at will, is particularly hard for persons  of our race and training, a race the natural direction of whose  consciousness is strongly outward, a training in which the practice of  introspective meditation finds no place.    Yoga--that \"union\" which brings inward vision, the contribution of the  East to the spiritual life of the West--will bring profound changes  into the art of the West, since art springs from consciousness. The  consciousness of the West now concerns itself with the visible world  almost exclusively, and Western art is therefore characterized by an  almost slavish fidelity to the ephemeral appearances of things--the  record of particular moods and moments. The consciousness of the East  on the other hand, is subjective, introspective. Its art accordingly  concerns itself with eternal aspects, with a world of archetypal  ideas in which things exist not for their own sake, but as symbols of  supernal things. The Oriental artist avoids as far as possible trivial  and individual rhythms, seeking always the fundamental rhythm of the  larger, deeper life.    Now this quality so earnestly sought and so highly prized in Oriental  art, is the very thing which our art and our architecture most  conspicuously lack. To the eye sensitive to rhythm, our essays in  these fields appear awkward and unconvincing, lacking a certain  _inevitability_. We must restore to art that first great canon of  Chinese aesthetics, \"_Rhythmic vitality,_ or the life movement of the  spirit through the rhythm of things.\" It cannot be interjected from  the outside, but must be inwardly realized by the \"stilling\" of the  mind above described.    Art cannot dispense with symbolism; as the letters on this page convey  thoughts to the mind, so do the things of this world, organized into  a language of symbols, speak to the soul through art. But in the  building of our towers of Babel, again mankind is stricken with a  confusion of tongues. Art has no _common language;_ its symbols are  no longer valid, or are no longer understood. This is a condition for  which materialism has no remedy, for the reason that materialism sees  always the pattern but never that which the pattern represents. We  must become _spiritually illumined_ before we can read nature truly,  and re-create, from such a reading, fresh and universal symbols for  art. This is a task beyond the power of our sad generation, enchained  by negative thinking, overshadowed by war, but we can at least glimpse  the nature of the reaction between the mystic consciousness and the  things of this world which will produce a new language of symbols. The  mystic consciousness looks upon nature as an arras embroidered over  with symbols of the things it conceals from view. We are ourselves  symbols, dwelling in a world of symbols--a world many times removed  from that ultimate reality to which all things bear figurative  witness; the commonest thing has yet some mystic meaning, and ugliness  and vulgarity exist only in the unillumined mind.    What mystic meaning, it may be asked, is contained in such things as  a brick, a house, a hat, a pair of shoes? A brick is the ultimate  atom of a building; a house is the larger body which man makes for his  uses, just as the Self has built its habitation of flesh and bones;  hat and shoes are felt and leather insulators with which we seek to  cut ourselves off from the currents which flow through earth and air  from God. It may be objected that these answers only substitute  for the lesser symbol a greater, but this is inevitable: if for the  greater symbol were named one still more abstract and inclusive, the  ultimate verity would be as far from affirmation as before. There is  nothing of which the human mind can conceive that is not a symbol of  something greater and higher than itself.    The dictionary defines a symbol as \"something that stands for  something else and serves to represent it, or to bring to mind one or  more of its qualities.\" Now this world is a _reflection_ of a higher  world, and that of a higher world still, and so on. Accordingly,  everything is a symbol of something higher, since by reflecting, it  \"stands for, and serves to represent it,\" and the thing symbolized,  being itself a reflection, is, by the same token, itself a symbol.  By reiterated repetitions of this reflecting process throughout the  numberless planes and sub-planes of nature, each thing becomes a  symbol, not of one thing only, but of many things, all intimately  correlated, and this gives rise to those underlying analogies, those  \"secret subterranean passages between matter and soul\" which have ever  been the especial preoccupation of the poet and the mystic, but which  may one day become the subject of serious examination by scientific  men.    Let us briefly pass in review the various terms of such an ascending  series of symbols: members of one family, they might be called, since  they follow a single line of descent.    Take gold: as a thing in itself, without any symbolical significance,  it is a metallic element, having a characteristic yellow color, very  heavy, very soft, the most ductile, malleable, and indestructible of  metals. In its minted form it is the life force of the body economic,  since on its abundance and free circulation the well-being of that  body depends; it is that for which all men strive and contend, because  without it they cannot comfortably live. This, then, is gold in its  first and lowest symbolical aspect: a life principle, a motive force  in human affairs. But it is not gold which has gained for man his  lordship over nature; it is fire, the yellow gold, not of the earth,  but of the air,--cities and civilizations, arts and industries, have  ever followed the camp fire of the pioneer. Sunlight comes next in  sequence--sunlight, which focussed in a burning glass, spontaneously  produces flame. The world subsists on sunlight; all animate creation  grows by it, and languishes without it, as the prosperity of cities  waxes or wanes with the presence or absence of a supply of gold. The  magnetic force of the sun, specialized as _prana_ (which is not the  breath which goes up and the breath which goes down, but that other,  in which the two repose), fulfils the same function in the human body  as does gold in civilization, sunlight in nature: its abundance makes  for health, its meagreness for enervation. Higher than _prana_ is the  mind, that golden sceptre of man's dominion, the Promethean gift of  fire with which he menaces the empire of the gods. Higher still, in  the soul, love is the motive force, the conqueror: a \"heart of gold\"  is one warmed and lighted by love. Still other is the desire of the  spirit, which no human affection satisfies, but truth only, the Golden  Person, the Light of the World, the very Godhead itself. Thus there is  earthy, airy, etheric gold; gold as intellect, gold as love, gold as  truth; from the curse of the world, the cause of a thousand crimes,  there ascends a Jacob's Ladder of symbols to divinity itself, whereby  men may learn that God works by sacrifice: that His universe is itself  His broken body. As gold in the purse, fire on the forge, sunlight  for the eyes, breath in the body, knowledge in the mind, love in the  heart, and wisdom in the understanding, He draws all men unto Him,  teaching them the wise use of wealth, the mastery over nature, the  care of the body, the cultivation of the mind, the love of wife and  child and neighbour, and, last lesson of all, He teaches them that in  industry, in science, in art, in sympathy and understanding, He it is  they are all the while knowing, loving, becoming; and that even when  they flee Him, His are the wings--      \"When me they fly, I am the wings.\"    This attempt to define gold as a symbol ends with the indication of an  ubiquitous and immanent divinity in everything. Thus it is always: in  attempting to dislodge a single voussoir from the arch of truth, the  temple itself is shaken, so cunningly are the stones fitted together.  All roads lead to Rome, and every symbol is a key to the Great  Mystery: for example, read in the light of these correspondences, the  alchemist's transmutation of base metals into gold, is seen to be the  sublimation of man's lower nature into \"that highest golden sheath,  which is Brahman.\"    Keeping the first sequence clearly in mind, let us now attempt to  trace another, parallel to it: the feminine of which the first may  be considered the corresponding masculine. Silver is a white, ductile  metallic element. In coinage it is the synonym for ready cash,--gold  in the bank is silver in the pocket; hence, in a sense, silver is  the _reflection_, or the second power of gold. Just as ruddy gold is  correlated with fire, so is pale silver with water; and as fire is  affiliated with the sun, so do the waters of the earth follow the  moon in her courses. The golden sun, the silver moon: these commonly  employed descriptive adjectives themselves supply the"]]]
