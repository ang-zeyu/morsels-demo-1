There, out of that dark corner, had the form risen up, and moved  toward him. But might it not have been the effect of light and shade  produced by the moonbeams, and the dark branches of a large tree close  to the window, when agitated by the high wind? Perhaps he had seen  this, and then fallen asleep, and all combined, had woven itself into  a dream. But the name of Emily Varnier! Edward did not remember ever  to have heard it; certainly it had never been mentioned in Ferdinand's  letters. Could it be the name of his love, of the object of that  ardent and unfortunate passion? Could the vision be one of truth? He  was meditating, lost in thought, when there was a knock at his door,  and the servant entered. Edward rose hastily, and sprang out of  bed. As he did so, he heard something fall with a ringing sound;  the servant stooped and picked up a gold ring, plain gold, like a  wedding-ring. Edward shuddered: he snatched it from the servant's  hand, and the color forsook his cheeks as he read the two words  \"Emily Varnier\" engraved inside the hoop. He stood there like one  thunderstruck, as pale as a corpse, with the proof in his hand that  he had not merely dreamed, but had actually spoken with the spirit  of his friend. A servant of the household came in to ask whether the  Lieutenant wished to breakfast in his room, or down stairs with the  family. Edward would willingly have remained alone with the thoughts  that pressed heavily on him, but a secret dread lest his absence  should be remarked, and considered as a proof of fear, after all  that had passed on the subject of the haunted room, determined him  to accept the proposal. He dressed hastily, and arranged his hair  carefully, but the paleness of his face, and the traces of tears in  his eyes, were not to be concealed, and he entered the saloon, where  the family were already assembled at the breakfast-table, with the  chaplain and the doctor.    The Baron rose to greet him: one glance at the young officer's face  was sufficient; he pressed his hand in silence, and led him to a  place by the side of the Baroness. An animated discussion now began  concerning the weather, which was completely changed; a strong south  wind had risen in the night, so there was now a thaw. The snow was all  melted--the torrents were flowing once more, and the roads impassable.    \"How can you possibly reach Blumenberg, to-day?\" the Baron inquired of  his guest.    \"That will be well nigh impossible,\" said the doctor. \"I am just  come from a patient at the next village, and I was nearly an hour  performing the same distance in a carriage that is usually traversed  on foot in a quarter of an hour.\"    Edward had not given a thought this morning to the shooting-match. Now  that it had occurred to him to remember it, he felt little regret at  being detained from a scene of noisy festivity which, far from being  desirable, appeared to him actually distasteful in his present frame  of mind. Yet he was troubled by the thought of intruding too long  on the hospitality of his new friends; and he said, in a hesitating  manner--    \"Yes! but I must try how far--\"    \"That you shall not do,\" interrupted the Baron. \"The road is always  bad: and in a thaw it is always dangerous. It would go against  my conscience to allow you to risk it. Remain with us: we have no  shooting-match or ball to offer you, but--\"    \"I shall not certainly regret either,\" cried Edward, eagerly.    \"Well, then, remain with us, Lieutenant,\" said the matron, laying  her hand on his arm, with a kind, maternal gesture. \"You are heartily  welcome; and the longer you stay with us, the better shall we be  pleased.\"    The youth bowed, and raised the lady's hand to his lips, and said--    \"If you will allow me--if you feel certain that I am not intruding--I  will accept your kind offer with joy. I never care much for a ball,  at any time, and to-day in particular\"--. He stopped short, and then  added, \"In such bad weather as this, the small amusement--\"    \"Would be dearly bought.\" interposed the Baron. \"Come, I am delighted;  you will remain with us.\"    He shook Edward warmly by the hand.    \"You know you are with old friends.\"    \"And, beside,\" said the doctor, with disinterested solicitude, \"it  would be imprudent, for M. de Wensleben does not look very well. Had  you a good night, sir?\"    \"Very good,\" replied Edward.    \"Without much dreaming?\" continued the other, pertinaciously.    \"Dreaming! oh, nothing wonderful,\" answered the officer.    \"Hem!\" said the doctor, shaking his head, portentiously. \"No one  yet--\"    \"Were I to relate my dream,\" replied Edward, \"you would understand it  no more than I did. Confused images--\"    The Baroness, who saw the youth's unwillingness to enlarge upon the  subject, here observed--    \"That some of the visions had been of no great importance--those which  she had heard related, at least.\"    The chaplain led the conversation from dreams, themselves, to their  origin, on which subject he and the doctor could not agree; and Edward  and his visions were left in peace at last. But when every one had  departed, each to his daily occupation, Edward followed the Baron into  his library.    \"I answered in that manner,\" he said, \"to get rid of the doctor  and his questioning. To you I will confess the truth. Your room has  exercised its mysterious influence over me.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the baron, eagerly.    \"I have seen and spoken with my Ferdinand, for the first time since  his death. I will trust to your kindness--your sympathy--not to  require of me a description of this exciting vision. But I have a  question to put to you.\"    \"Which I will answer in all candor, if it be possible.\"    \"Do you know the name of Emily Varnier?\"    \"Varnier!--certainly not.\"    \"Is there no one in this neighborhood who bears that name?\"    \"No one: it sounds like a foreign name.\"    \"In the bed in which I slept I found this ring,\" said Edward, while he  produced it; \"and the apparition of my friend pronounced that name.\"    \"Wonderful! As I tell you, I know no one so called--this is the  first time I ever heard the name. But it is entirely unaccountable  to me, how the ring should have come into that bed. You see, M. von  Wensleben, what I told you is true. There is something very peculiar  about that room: the moment you entered, I saw that the spell had been  working on you also, but I did not wish to forestall or force your  confidence.\"    \"I felt the delicacy, as I do now the kindness, of your intentions.  Those who are as sad as I am can alone tell the value of tenderness  and sympathy.\"    Edward remained this day and the following at the castle, and felt  quite at home with its worthy inmates. He slept twice in the  haunted room. He went away, and came back often; was always welcomed  cordially, and always quartered in the same apartment. But, in spite  of all this, he had no clew, he had no means of lifting the vail of  mystery which hung round the fate of Ferdinand Hallberg and of Emily  Varnier.           *       *       *       *       *    FROM PUNCH.

Above, on tallest trees remote      Green Ayahs perched alone,  And all night long the Mussak moan'd      Its melancholy tone.                          III.
