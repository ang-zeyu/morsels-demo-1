[_Exit_ [S']AKOONTALA _weeping, with the_ PRIEST _and the_ HERMITS.  _The_ KING _remains absorbed in thinking of her, though the curse  still clouds his recollection_.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    A miracle! a miracle!    KING.                                                        [_Listening_.    What has happened now?    PRIEST.                  [_Entering with an air of astonishment_.    Great Prince, a stupendous prodigy has just occurred.    KING.    What is it?    PRIEST.    May it please your Majesty, so soon as Kanwa's pupils had  departed, [S']akoontala, her eyes all bathed in tears, with  outstretched arms, bewailed her cruel fate--    KING.    Well, well, what happened then?    PRIEST.      When suddenly a shining apparition,    In female shape, descended from the skies,    Near the nymph's pool, and bore her up to heaven.    [_All remain motionless with astonishment_.    KING.    My good priest, from the very first I declined having anything to  do with this matter. It is now all over, and we can never, by our  conjectures, unravel the mystery; let it rest; go, seek repose.    PRIEST.                                              [_Looking at the_ KING.    Be it so. Victory to the King!                                                             [_Exit_.    KING.    Vetravati, I am tired out; lead the way to the bedchamber.    WARDER.    This way, Sire.                                                   [_They move away_.    KING.      Do what I will, I cannot call to mind    That I did e'er espouse the sage's daughter;    Therefore I have disowned her; yet 'tis strange    How painfully my agitated heart    Bears witness to the truth of her assertion,    And makes me credit her against my judgment.                                                           [_Exeunt_.           *       *       *       *       *          PRELUDE TO ACT VI.    SCENE.--_A Street_.    _Enter the King's brother-in-law as_ SUPERINTENDENT _of the city  police; and with him_ TWO CONSTABLES, _dragging a poor_  FISHERMAN, _who has his hands tied behind his back_.    BOTH THE CONSTABLES.                    [_Striking the prisoner_.    Take that for a rascally thief that you are; and now tell us, sirrah,  where you found this ring--aye, the King's own signet-ring. See, here  is the royal name engraved on the setting of the jewel.    FISHERMAN.                            [_With a gesture of alarm_.    Mercy! kind sirs, mercy! I did not steal it; indeed I did not.    FIRST CONSTABLE.    Oh! then I suppose the King took you for some fine Brahman, and  made you a present of it?    FISHERMAN.    Only hear me. I am but a poor fisherman, living at Sakravatara--    SECOND CONSTABLE.    Scoundrel, who ever asked you, pray, for a history of your birth  and parentage?    SUPERINTENDENT.                      [_To one of the_ CONSTABLES.    Suchaka, let the fellow tell his own story from the beginning.  Don't interrupt him.    BOTH CONSTABLES.    As you please, master. Go on, then, sirrah, and say what you've  got to say.    FISHERMAN.    You see in me a poor man, who supports his family by catching  fish with nets, hooks, and the like.    SUPERINTENDENT.                                      [_Laughing_.    A most refined occupation, certainly[85]!    FISHERMAN.    Blame me not for it, master,      The father's occupation, though despised    By others, casts no shame upon the son,    And he should not forsake it[86]. Is the priest    Who kills the animal for sacrifice    Therefore deemed cruel? Sure a low-born man    May, though a fisherman, be tender-hearted.    SUPERINTENDENT.    Well, well; go on with your story.    FISHERMAN.    One day I was cutting open a large carp[87] I had just hooked,  when the sparkle of a jewel caught my eye, and what should I find  in the fish's maw but that ring! Soon afterwards, when I was  offering it for sale, I was seized by your honours. Now you know  everything. Whether you kill me, or whether you let me go, this  is the true account of how the ring came into my possession.    SUPERINTENDENT.                      [_To one of the_ CONSTABLES.    Well, Januka, the rascal emits such a fishy odour that I have no  doubt of his being a fisherman; but we must inquire a little more  closely into this queer story about the finding of the ring.  Come, we'll take him before the King's household.    BOTH CONSTABLES.    Very good, master. Get on with you, you cutpurse.                                                      [_All move on_.    SUPERINTENDENT.    Now attend, Suchaka; keep your guard here at the gate; and hark  ye, sirrahs, take good care your prisoner does not escape, while  I go in and lay the whole story of the discovery of this ring  before the King in person. I will soon return and let you know  his commands.    BOTH CONSTABLES.    Go in, master, by all means; and may you find favour in the  King's sight.    [_Exit_ SUPERINTENDENT.  FIRST CONSTABLE.                                                [_After an interval_.    I say, Januka, the Superintendent is a long time away.    SECOND CONSTABLE.    Aye, aye; kings are not to be got at so easily. Folks must bide  the proper opportunity.    FIRST CONSTABLE.    Januka, my fingers itch to strike the first blow at this royal  victim here. We must kill him with all the honours, you know. I  long to begin binding the flowers round his head[88].                       [_Pretends to strike a blow at the_ FISHERMAN.    FISHERMAN.    Your Honour surely will not put an innocent man to a cruel death.    SECOND CONSTABLE.    There's our Superintendent at last, I declare. See! he is coming  towards us with a paper in his hand. We shall soon know the  King's command; so prepare, my fine fellow, either to become food  for the vultures, or to make acquaintance with some hungry cur.    SUPERINTENDENT.                                                         [_Entering_.    Ho, there, Suchaka! set the fisherman at liberty, I tell you. His  story about the ring is all correct.  SUCHAKA.    Oh! very good, Sir; as you please.    SECOND CONSTABLE.    The fellow had one foot in hell, and now here he is in the land  of the living.                                                     [_Releases him_.    FISHERMAN.                                     [_Bowing to the_ SUPERINTENDENT.    Now, master, what think you of my way of getting a livelihood?    SUPERINTENDENT.    Here, my good man, the King desired me to present you with this  purse. It contains a sum of money equal to the full value of the  ring.                                              [_Gives him the money_.    FISHERMAN.                                             [_Taking it and bowing_.    His Majesty does me too great honour.    SUCHAKA.    You may well say so. He might as well have taken you from the  gallows to seat you on his state elephant.    JANUKA.    Master, the King must value the ring very highly, or he would  never have sent such a sum of money to this ragamuffin.    SUPERINTENDENT.    I don't think he prizes it as a costly jewel so much as a  memorial of some person he tenderly loves. The moment it was  shown to him he became much agitated, though in general he  conceals his feelings.  SUCHAKA.    Then you must have done a great service--    JANUKA.    Yes, to this husband of a fish-wife.                                 [_Looks enviously at the_ FISHERMAN.    FISHERMAN.    Here's half the money for you, my masters. It will serve to  purchase the flowers you spoke of, if not to buy me your  good-will.    JANUKA.    Well, now, that's just as it should be.    SUPERINTENDENT.    My good fisherman, you are an excellent fellow, and I begin to  feel quite a regard for you. Let us seal our first friendship  over a glass of good liquor. Come along to the next wine-shop,  and we'll drink your health.    ALL.    By all means.                                                           [_Exeunt_.           *       *       *       *       *          ACT VI.    SCENE.--_The Garden of a Palace.    The nymph_ SANUMATI _is seen descending in a celestial car_.    SANUMATI.    Behold me just arrived from attending in my proper turn at the  nymph's pool, where I have left the other nymphs to perform their  ablutions, whilst I seek to ascertain, with my own eyes, how it  fares with King Dushyanta. My connexion with the nymph Menaka has  made her daughter [S']akoontala dearer to me than my own flesh and  blood; and Menaka it was who charged me with this errand on her  daughter's behalf.    [_Looking round in all directions_.]    How is it that I see no preparations in the King's household for  celebrating the great vernal festival[89]? I could easily  discover the reason by my divine faculty of meditation[134]; but  respect must be shown to the wishes of my friend. How then shall  I arrive at the truth? I know what I will do. I will become  invisible, and place myself near those two maidens who are  tending the plants in the garden.                                   [_Descends and takes her station_.    _Enter a_ MAIDEN, _who stops in front of a mango-tree, and gazes  at the blossom. Another_ MAIDEN _is seen behind her_.    FIRST MAIDEN.    Hail to thee, lovely harbinger of spring! The varied radiance of  thy opening flowers Is welcome to my sight. I bid thee hail,  Sweet mango, soul of this enchanting season.    SECOND MAIDEN.    Parabhritika, what are you saying there to yourself?    FIRST MAIDEN.    Dear Madhukarika, am I not named after the Koil[90]? and does not  the Koil sing for joy at the first appearance of the mango-blossom?    SECOND MAIDEN.            [_Approaching hastily, with transport_.    What! is spring really come?    FIRST MAIDEN.    Yes, indeed, Madhukarika, and with it the season of joy, love,  and song.    SECOND MAIDEN.    Let me lean upon you, dear, while I stead on tiptoe and pluck a  blossom, of the mango, that I may present it as an offering to  the god of love."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#19)"],[1,"time there  was no light on the lower stairs, but we encountered on the first-floor  landing a man who had just lit the lamp there. Thorndyke halted to  address him.    \"Can you tell me who occupies the chambers on the third floor?\"    \"The third floor has been empty about three months,\" was the reply.    \"We are going up to look at the chambers on the second floor,\" said  Thorndyke. \"Are they pretty quiet?\"    \"Quiet!\" exclaimed the man. \"Lord bless you the place is like a cemetery  for the deaf and dumb. There's the solicitors on the ground floor and  the architects on the first floor. They both clear out about six, and  when they're gone the house is as empty as a blown hegg. I don't wonder  poor Mr. Blackmore made away with his-self. Livin' up there all alone,  it must have been like Robinson Crusoe without no man Friday and not  even a blooming goat to talk to. Quiet! It's quiet enough, if that's  what you want. Wouldn't be no good to <i>me</i>.\"    With a contemptuous shake of the head, he turned and retired down the  next flight, and, as the echoes of his footsteps died away we resumed  our ascent.    \"So it would appear,\" Thorndyke commented, \"that when Jeffrey Blackmore  came home that last evening, the house was empty.\"    Arrived on the second-floor landing, we were confronted by a  solid-looking door on the lintel of which the deceased man's name was  painted in white lettering which still looked new and fresh. Thorndyke  knocked at the door, which was at once opened by Stephen Blackmore.    \"I haven't wasted any time before taking advantage of your permission,  you see,\" my colleague said as we entered.    \"No, indeed,\" said Stephen; \"you are very prompt. I have been rather  wondering what kind of information you expect to gather from an  inspection of these rooms.\"    Thorndyke smiled genially, amused, no doubt, by the similarity of  Stephen's remarks to those of mine which he had so recently criticized.    \"A man of science, Mr. Blackmore,\" he said, \"expects nothing. He  collects facts and keeps an open mind. As to me, I am a mere legal  Autolycus, a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles of evidence. When I have  accumulated a few facts, I arrange them, compare them and think about  them. Sometimes the comparison yields new matter and sometimes it  doesn't; but in any case, believe me, it is a capital error to decide  beforehand what data are to be sought for.\"    \"Yes, I suppose that is so,\" said Stephen; \"though, to me, it almost  looks as if Mr. Marchmont was right; that there is nothing to  investigate.\"    \"You should have thought of that before you consulted me,\" laughed  Thorndyke. \"As it is, I am engaged to look into the case and I shall do  so; and, as I have said, I shall keep an open mind until I have all the  facts in my possession.\"    He glanced round the sitting-room, which we had now entered, and  continued:    \"These are fine, dignified old rooms. It seems a sin to have covered up  all this oak panelling and that carved cornice and mantel with paint.  Think what it must have been like when the beautiful figured wood was  exposed.\"    \"It would be very dark,\" Stephen observed.    \"Yes,\" Thorndyke agreed, \"and I suppose we care more for light and less  for beauty than our ancestors did. But now, tell me; looking round these  rooms, do they convey to you a similar impression to that which the old  rooms did? Have they the same general character?\"    \"Not quite, I think. Of course the rooms in Jermyn Street were in a  different kind of house, but beyond that, I seem to feel a certain  difference; which is rather odd, seeing that the furniture is the same.  But the old rooms were more cosy, more homelike. I find something rather  bare and cheerless, I was almost going to say squalid, in the look of  these chambers.\"    \"That is rather what I should have expected,\" said Thorndyke. \"The opium  habit alters a man's character profoundly; and, somehow, apart from the  mere furnishing, a room reflects in some subtle way, but very  distinctly, the personality of its occupant, especially when that  occupant lives a solitary life. Do you see any evidences of the  activities that used to occupy your uncle?\"    \"Not very much,\" replied Stephen. \"But the place may not be quite as he  left it. I found one or two of his books on the table and put them back  in the shelves, but I found no manuscript or notes such as he used to  make. I noticed, too, that his ink-slab which he used to keep so  scrupulously clean is covered with dry smears and that the stick of ink  is all cracked at the end, as if he had not used it for months. It seems  to point to a great change in his habits.\"    \"What used he to do with Chinese ink?\" Thorndyke asked.    \"He corresponded with some of his native friends in Japan, and he used  to write in the Japanese character even if they understood English. That  was what he chiefly used the Chinese ink for. But he also used to copy  the inscriptions from these things.\" Here Stephen lifted from the  mantelpiece what looked like a fossil Bath bun, but was actually a clay  tablet covered with minute indented writing.    \"Your uncle could read the cuneiform character, then?\"    \"Yes; he was something of an expert. These tablets are, I believe,  leases and other legal documents from Eridu and other Babylonian cities.  He used to copy the inscriptions in the cuneiform writing and then  translate them into English. But I mustn't stay here any longer as I  have an engagement for this evening. I just dropped in to get these two  volumes--<i>Thornton's History of Babylonia</i>, which he once advised me to  read. Shall I give you the key? You'd better have it and leave it with  the porter as you go out.\"    He shook hands with us and we walked out with him to the landing and  stood watching him as he ran down the stairs. Glancing at Thorndyke by  the light of the gas lamp on the landing, I thought I detected in his  impassive face that almost imperceptible change of expression to which I  have already alluded as indicating pleasure or satisfaction.    \"You are looking quite pleased with yourself,\" I remarked.    \"I am not displeased,\" he replied calmly. \"Autolycus has picked up a few  crumbs; very small ones, but still crumbs. No doubt his learned junior  has picked up a few likewise?\"    I shook my head--and inwardly suspected it of being rather a thick head.    \"I did not perceive anything in the least degree significant in what  Stephen was telling you,\" said I. \"It was all very interesting, but it  did not seem to have any bearing on his uncle's will.\"    \"I was not referring only to what Stephen has told us, although that  was, as you say, very interesting. While he was talking I was looking  about the room, and I have seen a very strange thing. Let me show it to  you.\"    He linked his arm in mine and, walking me back into the room, halted  opposite the fire-place.    \"There,\" said he, \"look at that. It is a most remarkable object.\"    [Illustration: THE INVERTED INSCRIPTION.]    I followed the direction of his gaze and saw an oblong frame enclosing a  large photograph of an inscription in the weird and cabalistic  arrow-head character. I looked at it in silence for some seconds and  then, somewhat disappointed, remarked:    \"I don't see anything very remarkable in it, under the circumstances. In  any ordinary room it would be, I admit; but Stephen has just told us  that his uncle was something of an expert in cuneiform writing.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Thorndyke. \"That is my point. That is what makes it so  remarkable.\"    \"I don't follow you at all,\" said I. \"That a man should hang upon his  wall an inscription that is legible to him does not seem to me at all  out of the way. It would be much more singular if he should hang up an  inscription that he could <i>not</i> read.\"    \"No doubt,\" replied Thorndyke. \"But you will agree with me that it would  be still more singular if a man should hang upon his wall an inscription  that he <i>could</i> read--and hang it upside down.\"    I stared at Thorndyke in amazement.    \"Do you mean to tell me,\" I exclaimed, \"that that photograph is really  upside down?\"    \"I do indeed,\" he replied.    \"But how do you know? Have we here yet another Oriental scholar?\"    Thorndyke chuckled. \"Some fool,\" he replied, \"has said that 'a little  knowledge is a dangerous thing.' Compared with much knowledge, it may  be; but it is a vast deal better than no knowledge. Here is a case in  point. I have read with very keen interest the wonderful history of the  decipherment of the cuneiform writing, and I happen to recollect one or  two of the main facts that seemed to me to be worth remembering. This  particular inscription is in the Persian cuneiform, a much more simple  and open form of the script than the Babylonian or Assyrian; in fact, I  suspect that this is the famous inscription from the gateway at  Persepolis--the first to be deciphered; which would account for its  presence here in a frame. Now this script consists, as you see, of two  kinds of characters; the small, solid, acutely pointed characters which  are known as wedges, and the larger, more obtuse characters, somewhat  like our government broad arrows, and called arrow-heads. The names are  rather unfortunate, as both forms are wedge-like and both resemble  arrow-heads. The script reads from left to right, like our own writing,  and unlike that of the Semitic peoples and the primitive Greeks; and the  rule for the placing of the characters is that all the 'wedges' point to  the right or downwards and the arrow-head forms are open towards the  right. But if you look at this photograph you will see that all the  wedges point upwards to the left and that the arrow-head characters are  open towards the left. Obviously the photograph is upside down.\"    \"But,\" I exclaimed, \"this is really most mysterious. What do you suppose  can be the explanation?\"    \"I think,\" replied Thorndyke, \"that we may"]]]
