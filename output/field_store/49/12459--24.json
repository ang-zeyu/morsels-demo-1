But He that ruleth the heavens doeth all things well.          CHAPTER IX    CHICKAMAUGA      BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA    Sunday morning of that September day, the sun rose over the eastern hills  clear and beautiful.  The day itself seemed to have a Sabbath-day look  about it.  The battlefield was in a rough and broken country, with trees  and undergrowth, that ever since the creation had never been disturbed by  the ax of civilized man.  It looked wild, weird, uncivilized.    Our corps (Polk's), being in the engagement the day before, were held in  reserve.  Reader, were you ever held in reserve of an attacking army?  To see couriers dashing backward and forward; to hear the orders given  to the brigades, regiments and companies; to see them forward in line of  battle, the battle-flags waving; to hear their charge, and then to hear  the shock of battle, the shot and shell all the while sizzing, and  zipping, and thudding, and screaming, and roaring, and bursting, and  passing right over your heads; to see the litter corps bringing back the  wounded continually, and hear them tell how their command was being cut  to pieces, and that every man in a certain regiment was killed, and to  see a cowardly colonel (as we saw on this occasion--he belonged to  Longstreet's corps) come dashing back looking the very picture of terror  and fear, exclaiming, \"O, men, men, for God's sake go forward and help  my men! they are being cut all to pieces! we can't hold our position.  O, for God's sake, please go and help my command!\"  To hear some of our  boys ask, \"What regiment is that?  What regiment is that?\"  He replies,  such and such regiment.  And then to hear some fellow ask, \"Why ain't  you with them, then, you cowardly puppy?  Take off that coat and those  chicken guts; coo, sheep; baa, baa, black sheep; flicker, flicker;  ain't you ashamed of yourself? flicker, flicker; I've got a notion to  take my gun and kill him,\" etc.  Every word of this is true; it actually  happened.  But all that could demoralize, and I may say intimidate a  soldier, was being enacted, and he not allowed to participate.  How we  were moved from one position to another, but always under fire; our  nerves strung to their utmost tension, listening to the roar of battle in  our immediate front, to hear it rage and then get dimmer until it seems  to die out entirely; then all at once it breaks out again, and you think  now in a very few minutes you will be ordered into action, and then all  at once we go double-quicking to another portion of the field, the battle  raging back from the position we had left.  General Leonidas Polk rides  up and happening to stop in our front, some of the boys halloo out, \"Say,  General, what command is that which is engaged now?\"  The general kindly  answers, \"That is Longstreet's corps.  He is driving them this way,  and we will drive them that way, and crush them between the 'upper and  nether millstone.'\"  Turning to General Cheatham, he said, \"General,  move your division and attack at once.\"  Everything is at once set in  motion, and General Cheatham, to give the boys a good send-off, says,  \"Forward, boys, and give 'em h--l.\"  General Polk also says a good word,  and that word was, \"Do as General Cheatham says, boys.\"  (You know he was  a preacher and couldn't curse.)  After marching in solid line, see-sawing,  right obliqueing, left obliqueing, guide center and close up; commence  firing--fire at will; charge and take their breastworks; our pent-up  nervousness and demoralization of all day is suddenly gone.  We raise  one long, loud, cheering shout and charge right upon their breastworks.  They are pouring their deadly missiles into our advancing ranks from  under their head-logs.  We do not stop to look around to see who is  killed and wounded, but press right up their breastworks, and plant our  battle-flag upon it.  They waver and break and run in every direction,  when General John C. Breckinridge's division, which had been supporting  us, march up and pass us in full pursuit of the routed and flying Federal  army.      AFTER THE BATTLE    We remained upon the battlefield of Chickamauga all night.  Everything  had fallen into our hands.  We had captured a great many prisoners and  small arms, and many pieces of artillery and wagons and provisions.  The Confederate and Federal dead, wounded, and dying were everywhere  scattered over the battlefield.  Men were lying where they fell, shot in  every conceivable part of the body.  Some with their entrails torn out  and still hanging to them and piled up on the ground beside them, and  they still alive.  Some with their under jaw torn off, and hanging by a  fragment of skin to their cheeks, with their tongues lolling from their  mouth, and they trying to talk.  Some with both eyes shot out, with  one eye hanging down on their cheek.  In fact, you might walk over the  battlefield and find men shot from the crown of the head to the tip end  of the toe.  And then to see all those dead, wounded and dying horses,  their heads and tails drooping, and they seeming to be so intelligent as  if they comprehended everything.  I felt like shedding a tear for those  innocent dumb brutes.    Reader, a battlefield, after the battle, is a sad and sorrowful sight  to look at.  The glory of war is but the glory of battle, the shouts,  and cheers, and victory.    A soldier's life is not a pleasant one.  It is always, at best, one of  privations and hardships.  The emotions of patriotism and pleasure hardly  counterbalance the toil and suffering that he has to undergo in order  to enjoy his patriotism and pleasure.  Dying on the field of battle and  glory is about the easiest duty a soldier has to undergo.  It is the  living, marching, fighting, shooting soldier that has the hardships of  war to carry.  When a brave soldier is killed he is at rest.  The living  soldier knows not at what moment he, too, may be called on to lay down  his life on the altar of his country.  The dead are heroes, the living  are but men compelled to do the drudgery and suffer the privations  incident to the thing called \"glorious war.\"      A NIGHT AMONG THE DEAD    We rested on our arms where the battle ceased.  All around us everywhere  were the dead and wounded, lying scattered over the ground, and in many  places piled in heaps.  Many a sad and heart-rending scene did I witness  upon this battlefield of Chickamauga.  Our men died the death of heroes.  I sometimes think that surely our brave men have not died in vain.  It is true, our cause is lost, but a people who loved those brave and  noble heroes should ever cherish their memory as men who died for them.  I shed a tear over their memory.  They gave their all to their country.  Abler pens than mine must write their epitaphs, and tell of their glories  and heroism.  I am but a poor writer, at best, and only try to tell of  the events that I saw.    One scene I now remember, that I can imperfectly relate.  While a detail  of us were passing over the field of death and blood, with a dim lantern,  looking for our wounded soldiers to carry to the hospital, we came  across a group of ladies, looking among the killed and wounded for their  relatives, when I heard one of the ladies say, \"There they come with  their lanterns.\"  I approached the ladies and asked them for whom they  were looking.  They told me the name, but I have forgotten it.  We passed  on, and coming to a pile of our slain, we had turned over several of our  dead, when one of the ladies screamed out, \"O, there he is!  Poor fellow!  Dead, dead, dead!\"  She ran to the pile of slain and raised the dead  man's head and placed it on her lap and began kissing him and saying, \"O,  O, they have killed my darling, my darling, my darling!  O, mother,  mother, what must I do!  My poor, poor darling!  O, they have killed him,  they have killed him!\"  I could witness the scene no longer.  I turned  and walked away, and William A. Hughes was crying, and remarked, \"O,  law me; this war is a terrible thing.\"  We left them and began again  hunting for our wounded.  All through that long September night we  continued to carry off our wounded, and when the morning sun arose over  the eastern hills, the order came to march to Missionary Ridge.          CHAPTER X    MISSIONARY RIDGE      After retreating from Chickamauga, the Yankees attempted to re-form their  broken lines on Missionary Ridge.  We advanced to attack them, but they  soon fell back to Chattanooga.  We knew they were in an impregnable  position.  We had built those breastworks and forts, and knew whereof  we spoke.  We stopped on Missionary Ridge, and gnashed our teeth at  Chattanooga.  I do not know what our generals thought; I do not know what  the authorities at Richmond thought, but I can tell you what the privates  thought.  But here we were on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain,  looking right down into Chattanooga.  We had but to watch and wait.  We would starve them out.    The Federal army had accomplished their purpose.  They wanted  Chattanooga.  They laughed at our triumph, and mocked at our victory.  They got Chattanooga.  \"Now, where are you, Johnny Reb?  What are you  going to do about it?  You've got the dry grins, arn't you?  We've got  the key; when the proper time comes we'll unlock your doors and go in.  You are going to starve us out, eh?  We are not very hungry at present,  and we don't want any more pie.  When we starve out we'll call on you for  rations, but at present we are not starving, by a jug full; but if you  want any whisky or tobacco, send over and we'll give you some.  We've  got all we wanted, and assure you we are satisfied.\"    The above remarks are the supposed colloquy that took place between the  two armies.  Bragg, in trying to starve the Yankees out, was starved out  himself.

It was a rare stroke of  policy in the Incas, who could thus accommodate their religion to  their interests. *13    [Footnote 11: Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms.    These consecrated objects were termed huacas, - a word of most  prolific import; since it signified a temple, a tomb, any natural  object remarkable for its size or shape, in short, a cloud of  meanings, which by their contradictory sense have thrown  incalculable confusion over the writings of historians and  travellers.]    [Footnote 12: \"La orden por donde fundavan sus huacas que ellos  llamavan a las Idolatrias hera porque decian que todas criava el  sol i que les dava madre por madre que mostravan a la tierra,  porque decian que tenia madre, i tenian le echo su vulto i sus  adoratorios, i al fuego decian que tambien tenia madre i al mais  i a las otras sementeras i a las ovejas iganado decian que tenian  madre, i a la chocha ques el brevaje que ellos usan decian que el  vinagre della hera la madre i lo reverenciavan i llamavan mama  agua madre del vinagre, i a cada cosa adoravan destas de su  manera.\" Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.]    [Footnote 13: Pedro Pizarro, Descub. y Conq., Ms.    So it seems to have been regarded by the Licentiate Ondegardo.  \"E los Idolos estaban en aq1 galpon grande de la casa del Sol, y  cada Idolo destos tenia su servicio y gastos y mugeres, y en la  casa del Sol le iban a hacer reverencia los que venian de su  provincial para lo qual e sacrificios que se hacian proveian de  su misma tierra ordinaria e muy abundantemente por la misma orden  que lo hacian quando estaba en la misma provincia, que daba gran  autoridad a mi parecer e aun fuerza a estos Ingas que cierto me  causo gran admiracion.\" Rel. Seg., Ms.]    But the worship of the Sun constituted the peculiar care of the  Incas, and was the object of their lavish expenditure.  The most  ancient of the many temples dedicated to this divinity was in the  Island of Titicaca, whence the royal founders of the Peruvian  line were said to have proceeded.  From this circumstance, this  sanctuary was held in peculiar veneration.  Every thing which  belonged to it, even the broad fields of maize, which surrounded  the temple, and formed part of its domain, imbibed a portion of  its sanctity. The yearly produce was distributed among the  different public magazines, in small quantities to each, as  something that would sanctify the remainder of the store.  Happy  was the man who could secure even an ear of the blessed harvest  for his own granary! *14    [Footnote 14: Garcilasso. Com. Real, Parte 1, lib. 3, cap. 25.]  But the most renowned of the Peruvian temples the pride of the  capital, and the wonder of the empire, was at Cuzco, where, under  the munificence of successive sovereigns, it had become so  enriched, that it received the name of Coricancha, or \"the Place  of Gold.\" It consisted of a principal building and several  chapels and inferior edifices, covering a large extent of ground  in the heart of the city, and completely encompassed by a wall,  which, with the edifices, was all constructed of stone.  The work  was of the kind already described in the other public buildings  of the country, and was so finely executed, that a Spaniard, who  saw it in its glory, assures us, he could call to mind only two  edifices in Spain, which, for their workmanship, were at all to  be compared with it. *15 Yet this substantial, and, in some  respects, magnificent structure, was thatched with straw!    [Footnote 15: \"Tenia este Templo en circuito mas de quatro  cientos pasos, todo cercado de una muralla fuerte, labrado todo  el edificio de cantera muy excelente de fina piedra, muy bien  puesta y asentada, y algunas piedras eran muy grandes y  soberbias, no tenian mezcla de tierra ni cal, sino con el betun  que ellos suelen hacer sus edificios, y estan tan bien labradas  estas piedras que no se les parece mezcla ni juntura ninguna.  En  toda Espana no he visto cosa que pueda comparar a estas paredes y  postura de piedra, sino a la torre que llaman la Calahorra que  esta junto con la puente de Cordoba, y a una obra que vi en  Toledo, cuando fui a presentar la primera parte de mi Cronica al  Principe Dn Felipe.\" Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 24]    The interior of the temple was the most worthy of admiration.  It  was literally a mine of gold.  On the western wall was emblazoned  a representation of the deity, consisting of a human countenance,  looking forth from amidst innumerable rays of light, which  emanated from it in every direction, in the same manner as the  sun is often personified with us.  The figure was engraved on a  massive plate of gold of enormous dimensions, thickly powdered  with emeralds and precious stones. *16 It was so situated in  front of the great eastern portal, that the rays of the morning  sun fell directly upon it at its rising, lighting up the whole  apartment with an effulgence that seemed more than natural, and  which was reflected back from the golden ornaments with which the  walls and ceiling were everywhere incrusted.  Gold, in the  figurative language of the people, was \"the tears wept by the  sun,\" *17 and every part of the interior of the temple glowed  with burnished plates and studs of the precious metal.  The  cornices, which surrounded the walls of the sanctuary, were of  the same costly material; and a broad belt or frieze of gold, let  into the stonework, encompassed the whole exterior of the  edifice. *18    [Footnote 16: Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms - Cieza de Leon, Cronica,  cap. 44, 92.    \"La figura del Sol, muy grande, hecha de oro obrada muy  primamente engastonada en muchas piedras ricas.\" Sarmiento,  Relacion, Ms., cap. 24.]    [Footnote 17: \"I al oro asimismo decian que era lagrimas que el  Sol llorava.\" Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.]    [Footnote 18: Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 24.  - Antig. y  Monumentos del Peru, Ms.    \"Cercada junto a la techumbre de una plancha de oro de palmo i  medio de ancho i lo mismo tenian por de dentro en cada bohio o  casa i aposento.\" (Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.) \"Tenia una cinta  de planchas de oro de anchor de mas de un palmo enlazadas en las  piedras.\" Pedro Pizarro, Descub. y Conq., Ms.]  Adjoining the principal structure were several chapels of smaller  dimensions.  One of them was consecrated to the Moon, the deity  held next in reverence, as the mother of the Incas.  Her effigy  was delineated in the same manner as that of the Sun, on a vast  plate that nearly covered one side of the apartment.  But this  plate, as well as all the decorations of the building, was of  silver, as suited to the pale, silvery light of the beautiful  planet. There were three other chapels, one of which was  dedicated to the host of Stars, who formed the bright court of  the Sister of the Sun; another was consecrated to his dread  ministers of vengeance, the Thunder and the Lightning; and a  third, to the Rainbow, whose many-colored arch spanned the walls  of the edifice with hues almost as radiant as its own.  There  were besides several other buildings, or insulated apartments,  for the accommodation of the numerous priests who officiated in  the services of the temple. *19    [Footnote 19: Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 24. - Garcilasso,  Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 3, cap. 21. - Pedro Pizarro, Descub. y  Conq., Ms.]    All the plate, the ornaments, the utensils of every description,  appropriated to the uses of religion, were of gold or silver.  Twelve immense vases of the latter metal stood on the floor of  the great saloon, filled with grain of the Indian corn; *20 the  censers for the perfumes, the ewers which held the water for  sacrifice, the pipes which conducted it through subterraneous  channels into the buildings, the reservoirs that received it,  even the agricultural implements used in the gardens of the  temple, were all of the same rich materials.  The gardens, like  those described, belonging to the royal palaces, sparkled with  flowers of gold and silver, and various imitations of the  vegetable kingdom.  Animals, also, were to be found there, -  among which the llama, with its golden fleece, was most  conspicuous, - executed in the same style, and with a degree of  skill, which, in this instance, probably, did not surpass the  excellence of the material. *21    [Footnote 20: \"El bulto del Sol tenian mui grande de oro, i todo  el servicio desta casa era de plata i oro, i tenian doze horones  de plata blanca que dos hombres no abrazarian cada uno quadrados,  i eran mas altos que una buena pica donde hechavan el maiz que  havian de dar al Sol, segun ellos decian que comiese.\" Conq. i  Pob. del Piru, Ms.    The original, as the Spanish reader perceives, says each of these  silver vases or bins was as high as a good lance, and so large  that two men with outspread arms could barely encompass them!  As  this might, perhaps,"]]]
