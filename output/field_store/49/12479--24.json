Some of the best disposed  parties will stumble over the old delusion of disarmament. They think it  is the gun that matters. They are wrong: the gun matters very much when  war breaks out; but what makes both war and the gun is the man behind  them. And if that man really means the peace of the world to be kept, he  will take care to have a gun to keep it with. The League of Peace must  have a first-rate armament, or the League of War will very soon make  mincemeat of it. The notion that the men of evil intent are to have all  the weapons will not work. Theoretically, all our armaments should be  pooled. But as we, the British Empire, will most certainly not pool our  defenses with anyone, and as we have not the very smallest intention of  disarming, and will go on building gun for gun and ship for ship in step  with even our dearest friends if we see the least risk of our being left  in a position of inferiority, we cannot with any countenance demand that  other Powers shall do what we will not do ourselves. Our business is not  to disable ourselves or anyone else, but to organize a balance of  military power against war, whether made by ourselves or any other  Power; and this can be done only by a combination of armed and fanatical  Pacifists of all nations, not by a crowd of non-combatants wielding  deprecations, remonstrances, and Christmas cards.      *America's Example: War at a Year's Notice.*    How far it will be possible to take these national armaments out of  national control remains to be seen. Already America, who is as deeply  demoralized by Capitalism as we are, though much less tainted with  Militarism now that Colonel Roosevelt has lost his front seat, has  pledged herself to several European States not to go to war with them  until the matter under dispute has been in the hands of an international  tribunal for a year. Now there is no military force on earth, nor likely  to be, strong enough to prevent America from treating these agreements  as Germany has just treated the 1839 Treaty guaranteeing the neutrality  of Belgium. Therefore the Militarists declare that the agreements are  not worth the scraps of paper they are written on. They always will  footle in this way. They might as well say that because there are crimes  which men can commit with legal impunity in spite of our haphazard  criminal codes, men always do commit them. No doubt nations will do what  it is to their interest to do. But because there is in every nation a  set of noisy moral imbeciles who cannot see that nations have an  overwhelming interest in creating and maintaining a tradition of  international good faith, and honouring their promissory notes as  scrupulously as the moral imbeciles pay their silly gambling debts and  fight their foolish duels, we are not, I presume, going to discard every  international guarantee except the howitzer. Why, the very Prussian  Militarists themselves are reviling us for doing what their own  Militarist preachers assumed as a matter of course that we should do:  that is, attack Prussia without regard to the interests of European  civilization when we caught her at a disadvantage between France and  Russia. But we should have been ashamed to do that if she had not, by  assuming that there was no such thing as shame (_alias_ conscience),  terrified herself into attacking France and Belgium, when, of course, we  were immediately ashamed not to defend them. This idiotic ignoring of  the highest energies of the human soul, without the strenuous pressure  of which the fabric of civilization--German civilization perhaps most of  all--could not hold together for a single day, should really be treated  in the asylums of Europe, not on battlefields.    I conclude that we might all very well make a beginning by pledging  ourselves as America has done to The Hague tribunal not to take up arms  in any cause that has been less than a year under arbitration, and to  treat any western Power refusing this pledge as an unpopular and  suspicious member of the European club. To break such a pledge would be  an act of brigandage; and the need for suppressing brigandage cannot be  regarded as an open question.      *The Security Will o' the Wisp.*    It will be observed that I propose no guarantee of absolute security.  Not being a sufferer from _delirium tremens_ I can live without it.  Security is no doubt the Militarists' most seductive bait to catch the  coward's vote. But their method makes security impossible, They  undertook to secure the English in Egypt from an imaginary Islam rising  by the Denshawai Horror, as a result of which nobody has ventured to  suggest that we should trust the Egyptian army in this conflict, though  India, having learnt from Mr. Keir Hardie and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald that  there are really anti-Militarists in England who regard Indians as  fellow creatures, is actually rallying to us against the Prussian  Junkers, who are, in Indian eyes, indistinguishable from the  Anglo-Indians who call Mr. Keir Hardie and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald  traitors, and whose panicstricken denial of even a decent pretence of  justice in the sedition trials is particularly unfortunate just now. We  must always take risks; and we should never trade on the terror of  death, nor forget that this wretchedest of all the trades is none the  less craven because it can so easily be gilt with romance and heroism  and solemn national duty and patriotism and the like by persons whose  superficial literary and oratorical talent covers an abyss of  Godforsaken folly.      *The Only Real World Danger.*    The one danger before us that nothing can avert but a general raising of  human character through the deliberate cultivation and endowment of  democratic virtue without consideration of property and class, is the  danger created by inventing weapons capable of destroying civilization  faster than we produce men who can be trusted to use them wisely. At  present we are handling them like children. Now children are very  pretty, very lovable, very affectionate creatures (sometimes); and a  child can make nitroglycerine or chloride of nitrogen as well as a man  if it is taught to do so. We have sense enough not to teach it; but we  do teach the grown-up children. We actually accompany that dangerous  technical training with solemn moral lessons in which the most  destructive use of these forces at the command of kings and capitalists  is inculcated as heroism, patriotism, glory and all the rest of it. It  is all very well to fire cannons at the Kaiser for doing this; but we do  it ourselves. It is therefore undeniably possible that a diabolical  rhythm may be set up in which civilization will rise periodically to the  point at which explosives powerful enough to destroy it are discovered,  and will then be shattered and thrown back to a fresh start with a few  starving and ruined survivors. H.G. Wells and Anatole France have  pre-figured that result in fiction; and I cannot deny the strength of  its probability; for if England and Germany can find no better way of  celebrating their arrival at the highest point of civilization yet  attained than setting out to blow one another to fragments with  fulminates, it would seem that the peace of the neutral States is the  result, not of their being more civilized, but less heavily armed. And  when we see that the effect of the enterprise is not to redouble civil  vigilance and stimulate the most alert and jealous political criticism,  but on the contrary to produce an assumption that every constitutional  safeguard must be suspended until the war is over, and that every silly  tyrannical expedient such as censorship of the press, martial law, and  the like, will begin to work good instead of evil the moment men take to  murdering one another, it must be admitted that the prospect is not too  hopeful. Our only consolation is that civilization has survived very  destructive wars before, mostly because they have produced effects not  only unintended but violently objected to by the people who made them.  In 1870, for instance, Napoleon III. can hardly have intended his own  overthrow and return to exile in England; nor did Bismarck aim at the  restoration of French Republicanism and the formation of an  Anglo-Franco-Russian alliance against Prussia. Several good things may  come out of the present war if it leaves anybody alive to enjoy them.      *The Church and the War.*    And now, where in our society is the organ whose function it should be  to keep us constantly in mind that, as Lassalle said, \"the sword is  never right,\" and to shudder with him at the fact that \"the Lie is a  European Power\"? In no previous war have we struck that top note of keen  irony, the closing of the Stock Exchange and not of the Church. The  pagans were more logical: they closed the Temple of Peace when they drew  the sword. We turn our Temples of Peace promptly into temples of war,  and exhibit our parsons as the most pugnacious characters in the  community. I venture to affirm that the sense of scandal given by this  is far deeper and more general than the Church thinks, especially among  the working classes, who are apt either to take religion seriously or  else to repudiate it and criticize it closely. When a bishop at the  first shot abandons the worship of Christ and rallies his flock around  the altar of Mars, he may be acting patriotically, necessarily,  manfully, rightly; but that does not justify him in pretending that  there has been no change, and that Christ is, in effect, Mars.

What's that  ahead?\"    The locomotive had traveled ten miles or more from Half Way.  The  summit of the grade was not far ahead. But the forest shut out all view  of the station at Cliff City and the structures that stood near it.    Right across the steel ribbons on which the hercules 0001 ran, Tom had  seen something which brought the question to his lips.  Ned Newton saw  it too, and he shouted aloud:    \"Tree down! A log fallen, Tom!\"    He did not lose completely his self-control. But he grabbed the levers  with less care than he should. He tried to yank two of them at once,  and, in doing so, he fouled the brakes!    He had shut off connection with the current. But the brake control was  jammed. The locomotive quickly came to a halt. Then, before Tom could  get to the open door, the wheels began spinning in reverse and the  great Hercules 0001 began the descent of the steep grade, utterly  unmanageable!          Chapter XIX    Peril, The Mother of Invention      Tom Swift's first thought was one of thankfulness. Thankfulness that he  did not have a drag of fifty or sixty steel gondolas or the like to add  their weight to the down-pull. The locomotive's own weight of  approximately two hundred and seventy tons was enough.    For when the inventor pushed Ned aside and tried to handle the  controllers properly, he found them unmanageable. There was not a  chance of freeing them and getting power on the brakes. The Hercules  0001 was backing down the mountain side with a speed that was  momentarily increasing, and without a chance of retarding it!    The young inventor at that moment of peril, knew no more what to do to  avert disaster than Ned Newton himself.    It flashed across his mind, however, that others beside themselves were  in peril because of this accident. The fast express from the East that  should pass Half Way at four-thirteen, might already be climbing the  hill from Hammon. Hammon, at the foot of the grade, was twenty-five  miles away. Nor was the track straight.    If the operator at Half Way did not see the runaway locomotive and  telephone the danger to the foot of the grade, when the Hercules 0001  came tearing down the track it might ram something in the Hammon yard,  if it did not actually collide with the approaching westbound express.    Such an emergency as this is likely either to numb the brains of those  entangled in the peril or excite them to increased activity. Ned Newton  was apparently stunned by the catastrophe.  Tom's brain never worked  more clearly.    He seized the siren lever and set it at full, so that the blast called  up continuous echoes in the forest as the locomotive plunged down the  incline. He ran to the door again, on the side where Half Way station  lay, and hung out to signal the operator who had so recently given him  right of way on this stretch of mountain road.    \"We're going to smash! We're going to smash!\" groaned Ned Newton.    Tom read these words on his chum's lips, rather than heard them, for  the roar of the descending locomotive drowned every other sound. Tom  waved an encouraging hand, but did not reply audibly.    Meanwhile his brain was working as fast as ever it had. He had  instantly comprehended all the danger of the situation. But in addition  he appreciated the fact that such an accident as this might happen at  any time to this or any other locomotive he might build.    Automatic brakes were all right. If there had been a good drag of cars  behind the Hercules 0001, on which the compressed air brakes might have  been set, the present manifest peril might have been obliterated. The  brakes on the cars would have stopped the whole train.    But to halt this huge monster when alone, on the grade, was another  matter. Once the locomotive brake lever was jammed, as in this case,  there was no help for the huge machine. It had to ride to the foot of  the grade--if it did not chance to hit something on the way!    And with this realization of both the imminent peril and the need of  averting it, to Tom's active brain came the germ of an idea that he  determined to put into force, if he lived through this accident, on  each and every electric locomotive that he might in the future build.    This monster, flying faster and faster down the mountain side, was a  menace to everything in its track. There might be almost anything in  the way of rolling stock on the section between Half Way and Hammon at  the foot of the grade. If this thunderbolt of wood and steel collided  with any other train, with the force and weight gathered by its plunge  down the mountain, it would drive through such obstruction like a  projectile from Tom's own big cannon.    Tom realized this fact. He knew that whatever object the Hercules 0001  might strike, that object would be shattered and scattered all about  the right of way. What might happen to the runaway was another matter.  But the inventor believed that the electric locomotive would be less  injured than anything with which it came into collision.    At any rate, thought of the peril to himself and his invention had  secondary consideration in Tom Swift's mind. It was what the monster  which he could not control might do to other rolling stock of the H. &  P. A. that rasped the young fellow's mind.    The grade above Half Way had few curves. Tom soon caught the first  glimpse of the station. Would the operator hear the roar of the  descending runaway and understand what had happened?    He leaned far out from the open doorway and waved his cap madly. He  began to shout a warning, although he saw not a soul about the station  and knew very well that his voice was completely drowned by the voice  of the siren and the drumming of the great wheels.    Suddenly the tousled head of the operator popped out of his window. He  saw the coming locomotive, the drivers smoking!    To be a good railroad man one has to have his wits about him.  To be a  good operator at a backwoods station one has to have two sets of  wits--one set to tell what to do in an emergency, the other to listen  and apprehend the voice of the sounder.    This Half Way man was good. He knew better than to try the telegraph  instrument. He grabbed the telephone receiver and jiggled the hook up  and down on the standard while the Hercules 0001 roared past the  station.    It did not need Tom's frantically waving cap to warn him what had  happened. And he remembered clearly the fact of the expected westbound  flyer.    \"Hammon? Get me? This is Half Way. That derned electric hog has sprung  something and is coming down, lickity-split!    \"Yes! Clear your yard! Where's Number Twenty-eight? Good! Side her, or  she'll be ditched. Get me?\"    The voice at the other end of the wire exploded into indignant  vituperation. Then silence. The Half Way operator had done his  best--his all. He ran out upon the platform. The electric locomotive  had disappeared behind the woods, but the roar of its wheels and the  shrill voice of its siren echoed back along the line.    The sound faded into insignificance. The operator went back into his  hut and stayed close by the telephone instrument for the next ten  minutes to learn the worst.    If the operator's nerves were tense, what about those of Tom Swift and  his chum? Ned staggered to the door and clung to Tom's arm. He shrilled  into the latter's ear:    \"Shall we jump?\"    \"I don't see any soft spots,\" returned Tom, grimly. \"There aren't any  life nets along this line.\"    Ned Newton was frightened, and with good reason. But if his chum was  equally terrified he did not show it. He continued to lean from the  open door to peer down the grade as the Hercules 0001 drove on.    Around curve after curve they flew. It entered Ned's tortured mind that  if his chum had wanted speed, he was getting it now! He realized that  two miles a minute was a mere bagatelle to the pace now accomplished by  the runaway locomotive.          Chapter XX    The Result      As Ned Newton, fumbling at the controls when he saw the fallen tree  across the tracks, had jammed the brakes, the station master at Hammon,  at the bottom of this long grade on the Hendrickton & Pas Alos, had  stepped out to the blackboard in the barnlike waiting room and scrawled  with a bit of chalk:    \"No. 28--Westbound--due 3:38 is 15 m. late.\"      The fact, thus given to the general public or to such of it as might be  interested, averted what would have been a terrible catastrophe.    The fast express was late. When the babbling voice of the Half Way  operator over the telephone warned Hammon of the coming of the runaway  electric locomotive, there was time to shift switches at the head of  the yard so that, when Number Twenty-eight came roaring in, she was  shunted on to a far track and flagged for a stop before she hit the  bumper.    Thirty seconds later, from the west, the Hercules 0001 roared down the  grade and shot into the cleared west track in a halo of smoke and dust.  Speed! No runaway had ever traveled faster and kept the rails. The  story of the incident was embalmed in railroad history, and no history  is so full of vivid incident as that of the rail.    When the first relay of excited railroad men reached the electric  locomotive after it had stopped on the long level, even Ned Newton had  pulled himself together and could look out upon the world with some  measure of calmness. Tom Swift was making certain notes and draughting  a curious little diagram upon a page of his notebook.    \"What happened to you, Mr. Swift?\" was the demand of the first arrival.    \"Oh, my foot slipped,\" said the young inventor, and they got nothing"]]]
