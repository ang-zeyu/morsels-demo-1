You came unbidden, and you may  depart when you please.\"    A general silence succeeded this speech.    Toro's aid was not to be despised.    His huge body and his muscular arm had gained him the consideration of  most of those lawless men, who literally revered brute strength.    \"Wait, wait,\" said a brigand, stepping forward. \"Let us not be too  hasty. Some are for Toro, and some are for Tomaso.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Say on.\"    \"Let us put it to the vote, and let each of the disputants pledge  himself to abide by the decision.\"    \"Good.\"    \"What says Toro?\"    \"Agreed.\"    \"And so am I,\" returned Tomaso, promptly.    \"Hands up, then, for Toro.\"    Half the hands were uplifted and counted over.    \"Now for Tomaso.\"    Up went the hands of the other side, and when they came to tell them  off, it was discovered that the brigands were equally divided in their  choice.    \"We cannot have two leaders,\" said the brigand Ymeniz.    \"No, no.\"    \"Then we must have neither, as the matter stands.\"    \"Unless one gives way.\"    \"No,\" ejaculated the Italian, fiercely, \"unless Tomaso likes to decide  by the sword which of us shall have the lead.\"    \"I'm agreed to that,\" retorted Tomaso, promptly. \"Let us fight for it,  and may the best man win.\"    \"Agreed.\"    \"Hurrah, hurrah!\"    A ring was formed, and preparations made for the deadly encounter.    As they were not agreed about the choice of weapons, a coin was thrown  up, and Toro won.    Tomaso would have chosen pistols, for he was an excellent shot, and it  gave him the superiority; whereas, although not altogether unskilled in  fence, Toro's superior weight and size gave him a great advantage with  the sword.    However, there was nothing for it now but to fight.    The combatants stripped to the waist, and each received his weapon from  his second.    They were long, heavy swords, cut and thrust, like the heavy cavalry  carry, and with these there could be but one result.    Death!    There were no half measures with these weapons.    \"Now, then,\" exclaimed the Italian, impatiently, \"why this dallying? On  guard.\"    \"I am ready,\" cried Tomaso, gripping his sword firmly.    The swords met with a clash which sent forth a shower of sparks, and  both men recoiled with the force of the shock.    Recovering themselves quickly, however, they went to work in real  savage style, and chopped away at each other with vicious earnestness.    Now Tomaso, it was clear, could not hold his own in a battle wherein  mere brute force was to have the best of it, and feeling himself at a  disadvantage in this respect, he dodged about his adversary as nimbly  as Harlequin himself.    Being very quick-sighted, he saw what sort of a blow was coming ere it  was fairly dealt, and so he shaped his defence.    If it was a desperate stroke, he jumped out of its reach.    If a light one, he turned it off upon the edge of his own weapon.    In this way he worked upon Toro to such an extent that the Italian's  temper got the mastery of him.    Tomaso was attacking him so closely that the Italian looked like losing  the battle.    Toro was bleeding from a dozen small flesh wounds.    Tomaso was, up to this moment, almost unscathed.    Presently he grew over bold, and incautiously trusting himself within  reach, Toro lunged so sharply out that it was only by the merest shave  he escaped being spitted on the Italian's long sword like a lark on a  skewer.    As it was the sword pierced the waistband of his nether garments.    Tomaso stumbled, and so nearly lost his balance that it took him all  his time to parry the next stroke, which was put in with equal  smartness and vigour. One blow, that might have brought down an  elephant, sent Tomaso on to his knees.    The same stroke made a notch in the Greek's weapon half an inch deep.    Had he caught the blow upon the flat of his sword, it would have been  shivered to atoms beyond all doubt.    Toro saw his chance.    Nor was he at all slow to avail himself of it.    Quick as thought, another blow fell, and out of his grasp flew the  Greek's blade.    He lay prostrate at the mercy of his adversary.    \"Beg your life,\" cried Toro, planting his heavy foot firmly upon his  adversary's chest.    \"Never,\"    \"Then die!\"    He raised his sword.    But he paused.    Was it the action of a brave man to take the life of a defenceless foe?    Well, it was not the thought of such romantic notions which troubled  Toro; it was simply because there were spectators.    These spectators, he knew, would judge it harshly.    He thirsted for Tomaso's blood.    Yet he dared not indulge in his brutal passion.    Therefore, making a virtue of the necessity, he lowered his sword, and  spurning his beaten adversary with his foot, bade him rise.    \"Then take your life unasked,\" he said coarsely, \"and in future learn  to know and to respect your superiors.\"    Toro's speech was received with cheers by the brigands.          CHAPTER XIV.    THE NEW CAPTAIN--HUNSTON'S TROUBLE--THE ARM AND ITS LEGEND--HOW  EMMERSON'S VENGEANCE WORKS STEALTHILY ON.      \"What do you say, men, now?\" demanded the huge Italian, as he wiped his  sword.    \"Huzza for Toro!\"    \"Have I fairly earned my right to take the lead here?\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"I want you to be unanimous,\" he persisted.    \"We are.\"    Toro fixed his eyes upon one or two of the disappointed supporters of  Tomaso, who had not uttered a word since the discomfiture of their  champion, and said to them especially--    \"If any of you object to me as a leader, let them come forward now and  speak up.\"    There were one or two murmuring voices.    \"Look,\" cried the giant Toro, \"men all, if any here still denies my  power, let them step forward, and this sword shall prove my right.\"    This was final.    After the manner in which Toro had just dealt with their friend Tomaso,  they were not encouraged to provoke a quarrel. And so, by his daring  audacity and brute strength, Toro the Italian raised himself to the  leadership of the Greek brigands.    None dared to dispute his sway from that moment.    Some had a difficulty to swallow the bitter pill, but the alternative  was so very unpleasant that they got over it.           *       *       *       *       *    And Harkaway's enemy Hunston?    Why has he fallen so into the background of late?    His sole thoughts have been engrossed by the fearful sufferings to  which he is subject.    That dreadful arm--the legacy of vengeance of the murdered Emmerson.  Where the evil was it baffled all his skill to discover.    Slowly yet surely this horrible piece of mechanism was eating away its  wearer's life.    \"It seems almost as though some subtle poison were slowly injected into  my body through this arm,\" thought Hunston, \"and yet I can not work  without it.\"    Never was vengeance more terrible than that of the dead Robert  Emmerson.    The wonder was that Hunston lived through it.    His constitution must have been of iron.    The arm was removed, but only with infinite trouble and suffering; and  then, after some considerable time, Hunston began to experience a faint  sense of relief.    The sufferings slowly diminished.    This convinced Hunston that he had been correct in supposing that the  poison was concealed in the mechanical arm.    He laid bare as much of it as he could without permanently damaging it,  and pored over it for hours at a stretch.    To what good?    None.    Now this limb was the work of no common artificer.    It was the work of a hand of rare cunning.    A master spirit had invented it, and its mystery was far too deep to be  penetrated by a common bungler.    Hunston was at last so tortured that, disguising himself, he one day  left the mountains, and sought the advice of a surgeon.    \"The man who planned this arm,\" said the surgeon to whom Hunston  submitted it for examination, \"must have devoted a lifetime to the  manufacture and perfecting of this mechanical limb.\"    Hunston smiled.    He knew too well how little time the wretched man Emmerson gave to any  thing like industrial pursuits.    \"What is this?\" asked this same surgeon, pointing to the flat of the  arm, where the engraved legend was almost obscured with a dark stain.    Hunston changed colour and fidgeted about.    \"I don't know.\"    \"There is something written.\"    \"Yes, yes, so I believe, but it is obscured by that stain--a stain--\"    He peered closer into the arm yet, and looked serious, as turning to  Hunston, he said--    \"Why, it is a blood-stain.\"    \"No, no!\" replied Hunston, hurriedly; \"impossible. It can not be.\"    \"Impossible or not,\" said the surgeon, \"blood it is, and nothing but  blood. Yet I see that, in spite of this stain, the reading is clear  enough.\"    \"Scarcely,\" said Hunston.    \"It is, though, and it is in English, I should say, too.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Can't you read it?\"    \"No.\"    \"Strange. Yet you are English.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I have some English friends here to whom I will show it, and--\"    Hunston broke in impatiently at this.    \"English here!\" he exclaimed. \"Where do they live?\"    \"At the villa--\"    \"What, the Harkaway family, do you mean?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you would take it there?\"    \"Why not? Mr. Harkaway is a clever man. He is surrounded also by clever  people; there is a curious old gentleman there, too, an old gentleman  of great learning, and he might be enabled to throw some light upon the  secret, which even the closest scrutiny can not penetrate.\"    Hunston listened to the end, but not without having to exercise a  certain amount of self-control.    \"How is this old gentleman called--this clever, learned old gentleman?\"    \"You seem to say that with a sneer, sir,\" said the surgeon; \"but you  may rely upon it he is a very great _savant_--a man of great  accomplishments--and a warrior who has--\"    \"Who has lost two legs!\"    \"Yes. You know him?\"    \"Slightly; his name is Mole.\"    \"It is.\"    \"And you would take my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#18)"],[1,"to the floor, which was of bamboos raised two feet above the  ground. When they were dressed they fell to at their breakfast, and then  went out of doors. Hassan had evidently been watching for them, for  he came out of his house, which was next to that which they occupied,  holding his little girl's hand. She at once ran up to them, saluting  them by their names.    \"Bahi very glad to see you,\" she said, \"very glad to see good, kind  officers.\" The child had picked up, during her month on board the  ship, a great deal of English, from her constant communication with the  officers and crew.    \"Bad men wound Dick,\" she went on pitifully. \"Wicked men to hurt him.\"    \"Bahi, will you tell your father how much we are obliged to him for  having come to our rescue. We should have been killed if he had not  come.\"    The child translated the sentence. The chief smiled.    \"Tell them,\" he said, \"that Hassan is glad to have been able to pay back  a little of the obligation he was under to them. Besides, Sehi Pandash  was my enemy. Good thing to help friends and kill enemy at the same  time. Tell them that Hassan does not want thanks; they did not like him  to thank them for saving you.\"    The child translated this with some difficulty. Then he led the  midshipmen round the village, and showed them the strong palisade which  had evidently just been erected, and explained, through the child, that  it had only been built before he left, as but fifteen men were available  for guarding the place in his absence.    The next four days were spent in shooting expeditions, and although they  met with no wild beasts, they secured a large number of bird skins for  the doctor. On the fifth day a native ran in and said that boats with  white men were coming. The midshipmen ran down to the bank, and saw the  ship's two cutters and a gig approaching. The captain himself was in the  stern of the latter, and the doctor was sitting beside him. A minute or  two later they were shaking hands with the officers, and saying a few  words to the men, who were evidently delighted to see them again. Just  as the greetings were over, Hassan, in a rich silk sarong and jacket,  came down towards them. He was leading his little daughter, and six  Malays followed them.    \"Welcome, Captain,\" he said gravely. \"Hassan very glad to see you. All  come right now.\"    \"Thank you, chief. We have learned from your messenger how gallantly you  have rescued my two officers, and put an end to our troubles by killing  the Rajah Sehi, and capturing the last of the piratical craft.\"    This was too much for Hassan, and had to be translated by Soh Hay.  Since the chief's return, a number of his men had been occupied in  constructing bamboo huts for the use of the captain, officers, and men,  also a large hall to be used for councils and meetings; and to this he  now led the captain and his officers. When they were seated, he made a  speech of welcome, saying what gladness it was to him to see there those  who had been so kind to him. Had he known when they would arrive, food  would have been ready for them; and he assured them that, however long  they might stay, they would be most heartily welcome, and that there  should be no lack of provisions. They had done an immense service to  him, and to all the other chiefs on the river, by breaking up the power  of one who preyed upon all his neighbors, and was a scourge to trade. As  there were still several bottles of the rajah's wine left, champagne was  now handed round.    \"It makes my heart glad to see you, Doctor,\" the chief said. \"See, I am  as strong and as well as ever. Had it not been for you, my arm might now  have been useless, and my ribs have grown through the flesh.\"    \"I don't think it would have been as bad as that,\" the doctor replied:  \"but there is no doubt that it was fortunate that you were able to  receive surgical treatment so soon after the accident. And it has been  fortunate for us, too, especially for our young friends here.\"    Conversation became general now, and the interpreter was kept hard at  work, and Bahi divided her attention between the officers and the men,  flitting in and out of the hall, and chattering away to the sailors and  marines who were breakfasting outside on the stores they had brought  up, supplemented by a bountiful supply of fruit, which grew in abundance  round the village. It was not long before a meal was served to the  officers, fowl having been hastily killed as soon as the boats were  seen approaching; several jungle fowl had been brought in that morning;  plaintains and rice were boiled, and cakes baked. Tea was forthcoming  from the boats' stores, and a hearty meal was eaten.        CHAPTER XI.      After the meal was concluded, the captain said to the chief:    \"Now, Hassan, we want to know how it was that you arrived at the nick of  time to save my officers' lives.\"    \"I had been watching for some days,\" the chief said quietly. \"When I  heard that many chiefs had joined Sehi Pandash, I said 'I must go and  help my white brothers,' but I dared not take many men away from here,  and as I had to hide, the fewer there were with me the better; so I came  down into the forest near Sehi's town, and found the wood full of men.  We had come down in sampans, so that I could send off messengers as  might be required. One of these I sent down to you, to warn you to be  prepared for an attack. Other messengers I had sent before from here;  but they must have been caught and killed, for I had been watched  closely when they found that I would not join against you.    \"When my last messenger returned, I was glad; I knew that you would be  on your guard, and would not be caught treacherously. Two of my men  were in the town when they began to fire on the ship, and I saw the  town destroyed, and followed Sehi to the place where the six prahus were  lying, and crossed the creek, and lay down in the woods near the village  on the other side; for I thought that something might happen. One of my  men went down in the night, and brought me news that the ship was gone.  As my messenger had told me that you had questioned him as to the other  entrance to the creek, I felt sure that you had gone there; so I was not  surprised when, just before daybreak, two guns were fired. We saw the  fight, the sinking of two of their vessels, and the attack by the water  pirates, and by the men of the rajah and the chiefs with him, and I  feared greatly that my friends would be overpowered.    \"I sent one of my men down to the mouth of the creek, to tell you how  much aid was wanted; but he saw the ship steaming up as he went, and so  came back to me. Then we heard the ship's great guns begin to fire, and  soon all was quiet where the fight had been going on. Then I saw the  other four boats start. One of them sank before she was out of sight,  and I soon heard that your ship had sunk another, and that two had got  away. It was not for another two days that I learned where they were,  and then I heard that they had gone into a creek twenty miles away;  there one had sunk, and the other had been joined by the two prahus that  had been far up the river; and I also learned that one of Sehi's men  had gone into the village and let himself be captured, so that he might  guide the ship's boats to the place where, as they thought, they would  find but one prahu, while three would be waiting for them. I was not  sure where the exact place was, for there are many creeks, but, with one  of my men, I rowed in a sampan all night, in hopes to arrive in time  to warn the boats; but it was not till I heard the firing that I knew  exactly where they were.    \"When I got there the fighting was over, and but one prahu had escaped,  and I learned from the men who had swum ashore from those that had been  sunk that one of the English boats had been destroyed, and many men  killed, but that two boats had gone down the creek again. It was also  said that the white officers and sailors had boarded the boat that had  escaped, and had been all killed. I thought it best to follow the prahu,  so that I could send word to you where she was to be found. As there  were many passages, it was difficult to find her, and I should have lost  her altogether had I not heard where Sehi was hiding, and guessed that  she would go there. It was late when I arrived at the village. There  one of my men learned that two young officers, who had been wounded, had  been brought there, and that Sehi was sending word to you that, unless  you gave him the conditions he asked, they would be put to death.    \"I did not know whether to send down to you, or to send up the river for  help; but I thought the last was best, for if you came in boats, then  Sehi's men would hear you, and the officers would be killed; so I sent  off my man with the sampan. I told him that he must not stop until he  got here. He must tell them that all my men, except fifty old ones who  were to guard the village, were to start in their canoes, and paddle  their hardest till they came within half a mile of the village, and he  was to come back with them to guide them, and I was to meet them. As  the prahus that had been up there were destroyed, the river was safe  for them to descend. I said that they must be at the point I named  last evening. They were two hours late, though they had paddled their  hardest. As soon as they disembarked I led them to the spot, and the  rest was easy. I knew that the prisoners who had been taken were my two  friends, for I saw them on the deck of the prahu; and glad indeed I was  to be able to pay my debt to them.\"    \"You have paid it indeed most nobly, Hassan,\" the captain said,  holding out his hand, and grasping that of the chief, when, sentence by  sentence, the story was translated to him. \"Little did we think, when  you were brought on board the Serpent, that your friendship would turn  out of such value to us.\"    There was"]]]
