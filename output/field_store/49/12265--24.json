XI      Bright and genial were all the last days of June, when I loitered in the  lanes before the unwished day of my return to London. During this quiet,  pleasant time the greenfinch was perhaps more to me than any other  songster. In the village itself, with the adjacent lanes and orchards,  this pretty, seldom-silent bird was the most common species. The village  was his metropolis, just as London is ours--and the sparrow's; its lanes  were his streets, its hedges and elm trees his cottage rows and tall  stately mansions and public buildings. . We frequently find the  predominance of one species somewhat wearisome. Speaking for myself,  there are songsters that are best appreciated when they are limited in  numbers and keep their distance, but of the familiar, unambitious  strains of swallow, robin, and wren I never tire, nor, during these  days, could I have too much of the greenfinch, low as he ranks among  British melodists. Tastes differ; that is a point on which we are all  agreed, and every one of us, even the humblest, is permitted to have his  own preferences. Still, after re-reading Wordsworth's lines to \"The  Green Linnet,\" it is curious, to say the least of it, to turn to some  prosewriter--an authority on birds, perhaps--to find that this species,  whose music so charmed the poet, has for its song a monotonous croak,  which it repeats at short intervals for hours without the slightest  variation--a dismal sound which harmonizes with no other sound in  nature, and suggests nothing but heat and weariness, and is of all  natural sounds the most irritating. To this writer, then--and there are  others to keep him in countenance--the greenfinch as a vocalist ranks  lower than the lowest. One can only wonder (and smile) at such extreme  divergences. To my mind all natural sounds have, in some measure an  exhilarating effect, and I cannot get rid of the notion that so it  should be with every one of us; and when some particular sound, or  series of sounds, that has more than this common character, and is  distinctly pleasing, is spoken of as nothing but disagreeable,  irritating, and the rest of it, I am inclined to think that there is  something wrong with the person who thus describes it; that he is not  exactly as nature would have had him, but that either during his  independent life, or before it at some period of his prenatal existence,  something must have happened to distune him. All this, I freely confess,  may be nothing but fancy. In any case, the subject need not keep us  longer from the greenfinch--that is to say, _my_ greenfinch not another  man's.    From morning until evening all around and about the cottage, and out of  doors whithersoever I bent my steps, from the masses of deep green  foliage, sounded the perpetual airy prattle of these delightful birds.  One had the idea that the concealed vocalists were continually meeting  each other at little social gatherings, where they exchanged pretty  loving greetings, and indulged in a leafy gossip, interspersed with  occasional fragments of music, vocal and instrumental; now a long  trill--a trilling, a tinkling, a sweeping of one minute finger-tip over  metal strings as fine as gossamer threads--describe it how you will, you  cannot describe it; then the long, low, inflected scream, like a lark's  throat-note drawn out and inflected; little chirps and chirruping  exclamations and remarks, and a soft warbled note three or four or more  times repeated, and sometimes, the singer fluttering up out of the  foliage and hovering in the air, displaying his green and yellow plumage  while emitting these lovely notes; and again the trill, trill answering  trill in different keys; and again the music scream, as if some  unsubstantial being, fairy or woodnymph had screamed somewhere in her  green hiding-place. In London one frequently hears, especially in the  spring, half-a-dozen sparrows just met together in a garden tree, or  among the ivy or creeper on a wall, burst out suddenly into a confused  rapturous chorus of chirruping sounds, mingled with others of a finer  quality, liquid and ringing. At such times one is vexed to think that  there are writers on birds who invariably speak of the sparrow as a  tuneless creature, a harsh chirper, and nothing more. It strikes one  that such writers either wilfully abuse or are ignorant of the right  meaning of words, so wild and glad in character are these concerts of  town sparrows, and so refreshing to the tired and noise-vexed brain! But  now when I listened to the greenfinches in the village elms and  hedgerows, if by chance a few sparrows burst out in loud gratulatory  notes, the sounds they emitted appeared coarse, and I wished the  chirrupers away. But with the true and brilliant songsters it seemed to  me that the rippling greenfinch music was always in harmony, forming as  it were a kind of airy, subdued accompaniment to their loud and ringing  tones.    I had had my nightingale days, my cuckoo and blackbird and tree-pipit  days, with others too numerous to mention, and now I was having my  greenfinch days; and these were the last.    One morning in July I was in my sitting-room, when in the hedge on the  other side of the lane, just opposite my window, a small brown bird  warbled a few rich notes, the prelude to his song. I went and stood by  the open window, intently listening, when it sang again, but only a  phrase or two. But I listened still, confidently expecting more; for  although it was now long past its singing season, that splendid sunshine  would compel it to express its gladness. Then, just when a fresh burst  of music came, it was disturbed by another sound close by--a human  voice, also singing. On the other side of the hedge in which the bird  sat concealed was a cottage garden, and there on a swing fastened to a  pair of apple trees, a girl about eleven years old sat lazily swinging  herself. Once or twice after she began singing the nightingale broke out  again, and then at last he became silent altogether, his voice  overpowered by hers.  Girl and bird were not five yards apart. It  greatly surprised me to hear her singing, for it was eleven o'clock,  when all the village children were away at the National School, a time  of day when, so far as human sounds were concerned, there reigned an  almost unbroken silence. But very soon I recalled the fact that this was  a very lazy child, and concluded that she had coaxed her mother into  sending an excuse for keeping her at home, and so had kept her liberty  on this beautiful morning. About two minutes' walk from the cottage, at  the side of the crooked road running through the village, there was a  group of ancient pollarded elm trees with huge, hollow trunks, and  behind them an open space, a pleasant green slope, where some of the  village children used to go every day to play on the grass. Here I used  to see this girl lying in the sun, her dark chestnut hair loosed and  scattered on the sward, her arms stretched out, her eyes nearly closed,  basking in the sun, as happy as some heat-loving wild animal. No, it was  not strange that she had not gone to school with the others when her  disposition was remembered, but most strange to hear a voice of such  quality in a spot where nature was rich and lovely, and only man was, if  not vile, at all events singularly wanting in the finer human qualities.    Looking out from the open window across the low hedge-top, I could see  her as she alternately rose and fell with slow, indolent motion, now  waist-high above the green dividing wall, then only her brown head  visible resting against the rope just where her hand had grasped it. And  as she swayed herself to and fro she sang that simple melody--probably  some child's hymn which she had been taught at the Sunday-school; but it  was a very long hymn, or else she repeated the same few stanzas many  times, and after each there was a brief pause, and then the voice that  seemed to fall and rise with the motion went on as before. I could have  stood there for an hour--nay, for hours--listening to it, so fresh and  so pure was the clear young voice, which had no earthly trouble in it,  and no passion, and was in this like the melody of the birds of which I  had lately heard so much; and with it all that tenderness and depth  which is not theirs, but is human only and of the soul.    It struck me as a singular coincidence--and to a mind of so primitive a  type as the writer's there is more in the fact that the word  implies--that, just as I had quitted London, to seek for just such a  spot as I so speedily found, with the passionately exclaimed words of a  young London girl ringing in my ears, so now I went back with this  village girl's melody sounding and following me no less clearly and  insistently. For it was not merely remembered, as we remember most  things, but vividly and often reproduced, together with the various  melodies of the birds I had listened to; a greater and principal voice  in that choir, yet in no wise lessening their first value, nor ever out  of harmony with them.          EXOTIC BIRDS FOR BRITAIN      There are countries with a less fertile soil and a worse climate than  ours, yet richer in bird life. Nevertheless, England is not poor; the  species are not few in number, and some are extremely abundant.  Unfortunately many of the finer kinds have been too much sought after;  persecuted first for their beauty, then for their rarity, until now we  are threatened with their total destruction. As these kinds become  unobtainable, those which stand next in the order of beauty and rarity  are persecuted in their turn; and in a country as densely populated as  ours, where birds cannot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#18)"],[1,"  flowers are dead, or have their bright colors tarnished. Have you lived  in the moon, Smith, that I have to tell you these things?\"    \"No, dear, but in that island where all things, including flowers, were  different.\"    \"Ah, yes; tell me about the island.\"    Now \"that island\" was an unfortunate subject, and I was not prepared to  break the resolution I had made of prudently holding my tongue about its  peculiar institutions. \"How can I tell you?--how could you imagine it if  I were to tell you?\" I said, evading the question. \"You have seen the  heavens black with tempests, and have felt the lightnings blinding your  eyes, and have heard the crash of the thunder: could you imagine all  that if you had never witnessed it, and I described it to you?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then it would be useless to tell you. And now tell me about the rainbow  lilies, for I am a great lover of flowers.\"    \"Are you? Is it strange you should have a taste common to all human  beings?\" she returned with a pretty smile. \"But it is easier to ask  questions than to answer them. If you had never seen the sun setting in  glory, or the midnight sky shining with myriads of stars, could you  imagine these things if I described them to you?\"    \"No.\"    \"That word is an echo, Smith. You must wait for the earth to bring forth  her rainbow lilies, and the heart its love.\"    \"With or without flowers, the world is a paradise to me, with you at my  side, Yoletta. Ah, if you will be my Eve! How sweet it is to walk hand  in hand with you in the twilight; but it was not so nice when you were  scuttling from me like a wild rabbit. I'm glad to find that you do walk  sometimes.\"    \"Yes, sometimes--on solemn occasions.\"    \"Yes? Tell me about these solemn occasions.\"    \"This is not one of them,\" she replied, suddenly withdrawing her hand  from mine; then with a ringing laugh, she sped from me, bounding down  the hill-side with the speed and grace of a gazelle.    I instantly gave chase; but it was a very vain chase, although I put  forth all my powers. Occasionally she would drop on her knees to admire  some wild flower, or search for a lily bud; and whenever she came to a  large stone, she would spring on to it, and stand for some time  motionless, gazing at the rich hues of the afterglow; but always at my  approach she would spring lightly away, escaping from me as easily as a  wild bird. Tired with running, I at last gave up the hunt, and walked  soberly home by myself, wondering whether that conversation on the  summit of the hill, and all the curious information I had gathered from  it, should make me the most miserable or the most happy being upon  earth.              Chapter 12    The question whether I had reason to feel happy or the reverse still  occupied me after going to bed, and kept me awake far into the night. I  put it to myself in a variety of ways, concentrating my faculties on it;  but the result still remained doubtful. Mine was a curious position for  a man to be in; for here was I, very much in love with Yoletta, who said  that her age was thirty-one, and yet who knew of only one kind of  love--that sisterly affection which she gave me so unstintingly. Of  course I was surrounded with mysteries, being in the house but not of  it, to the manner born; and I had already arrived at the conclusion that  these mysteries could only be known to me through reading, once that  accomplishment was mine. For it seemed rather a dangerous thing to ask  questions, since the most innocent interrogatory might be taken as an  offense, only to be expiated by solitary confinement and a  bread-and-water diet; or, if not punishable in that way, it would  probably be regarded as a result of the supposed collision of my head  with a stone. To be reticent, observant, and studious was a safe plan;  this had served to make me diligent and attentive with my lessons, and  my gentle teacher had been much pleased with the progress I had made,  even in a few days. Her words on the hill had now, however, filled me  with anxiety, and I wanted to go a little below the surface of this  strange system of life. Why was this large family--twenty-two members  present, besides some absent pilgrims, as they are called--composed only  of adults? Again, more curious still, why was the father of the house  adorned with a majestic beard, while the other men, of various ages, had  smooth faces, or, at any rate, nothing more than a slight down on the  upper lip and cheeks? It was plain that they never shaved. And were  these people all really brothers and sisters? So far, I had been unable,  even with the most jealous watching, to detect anything like love-making  or flirting; they all treated each other, as Yoletta treated me, with  kindness and affection, and nothing more. And if the head of the house  was in fact the father of them all--since in two centuries a man might  have an indefinite number of children--who was the mother or mothers? I  was never good at guessing, but the result of my cogitations was one  happy idea--to ask Yoletta whether she had a living mother or not? She  was my teacher, my friend and guardian in the house, and if it should  turn out that the question was an unfortunate one, an offense, she would  be readier to forgive than another.    Accordingly, next day, as soon as we were alone together I put the  question to her, although not without a nervous qualm.    She looked at me with the greatest surprise. \"Do you mean to say,\" she  answered, \"that you do not know I have a mother--that there is a mother  of the house?\"    \"How should I know, Yoletta?\" I returned. \"I have not heard you address  any one as mother; besides, how is one to know anything in a strange  place unless he is told?\"    \"How strange, then, that you never asked till now! There is a mother of  the house--the mother of us all, of you since you were made one of us;  and it happens, too, that I am her daughter--her only child. You have  not seen her because you have never asked to be taken to her; and she is  not among us because of her illness. For very long she has been  afflicted with a malady from which she cannot recover, and for a whole  year she has not left the Mother's Room.\"    She spoke with eyes cast down, in a low and very sad voice. It was only  too plain now that in my ignorance I had been guilty of a grave breach  of the etiquette or laws of the house; and anxious to repair my fault,  also to know more of the one female in this mysterious community who had  loved, or at all events had known marriage, I asked if I might see her.    \"Yes,\" she answered, after some hesitation, still standing with eyes  cast down. Then suddenly, bursting into tears, she exclaimed: \"Oh,  Smith, how could you be in the world and not know that there is a mother  in every house! How could you travel and not know that when you enter a  house, after greeting the father, you first of all ask to be taken to  the mother to worship her and feel her hand on your head? Did you not  see that we were astonished and grieved at your silence when you came,  and we waited in vain for you to speak?\"    I was dumb with shame at her words. How well I remembered that first  evening in the house, when I could not but see that something was  expected of me, yet never ventured to ask for enlightment!    Presently, recovering from her tears, she went from the room, and, left  alone, I was more than ever filled with wonder at what she had told me.  I had not imagined that she had come into the world without a mother;  nevertheless, the fact that this passionless girl, who had told me that  there was only one kind of love, was the daughter of a woman actually  living in the house, of whose existence I had never before heard, except  in an indirect way which I failed to understand, seemed like a dream to  me. Now I was about to see this hidden woman, and the interview would  reveal something to me, for I would discover in her face and  conversation whether she was in the same mystic state of mind as the  others, which made them seem like the dwellers in some better place than  this poor old sinful, sorrowful world. My wishes, however, were not to  be gratified, for presently Yoletta returned and said that her mother  did not desire to see me then. She looked so distressed when she told me  this, putting her white arms about my neck as if to console me for my  disappointment, that I refrained from pressing her with questions, and  for several days nothing more was spoken between us on the subject.    At length, one day when our lesson was over, with an expression of  mingled pleasure and anxiety on her face, she rose and took my hand,  saying, \"Come.\"    I knew she was going to take me to her mother, and rose to obey her  gladly, for since the conversation I had had with her the desire to know  the lady of the house had given me no peace.    Leaving the music room, we entered another apartment, of the same  nave-like form, but vaster, or, at all events, considerably longer.  There I started and stood still, amazed at the scene before me. The  light, which found entrance through tall, narrow windows, was dim, but  sufficient to show the whole room with everything in it, ending at the  further extremity at a flight of broad stone steps. The middle part of  the floor, running the entire length of the apartment, was about twenty  feet wide, but on either side of this passage, which was covered with  mosaic, the floor was raised; and on this higher level I saw, as I  imagined, a great company of men and women, singly and in groups,  standing or seated on great stone chairs in various positions and  attitudes. Presently I perceived that these were not living beings, but  life-like effigies of stone, the drapery they were represented as  wearing being of many different richly-colored stones, having the  appearance of real garments. So natural did the hair look, that only  when I ascended the steps and touched the head of one"]]]
