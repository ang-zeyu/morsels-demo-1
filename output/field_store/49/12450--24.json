Over  and over, with the best talent and producers, they fail.    The boy and girl go to the party in spite of the uncle. It is while on  the way that the boy looks on the face of a stranger who afterwards mixes  up in his dream as the detective. There is a mistake in the printing  here. There are several minutes of a worldly-wise oriental dance to amuse  the guests, while the lovers are alone at another end of the garden. It  is, possibly, the aptest contrast with the seriousness of our hero and  heroine. But the social affair could have had a better title than the one  that is printed on the film \"An Old-fashioned Sweetheart Party.\" Possibly  the dance was put in after the title.    The lovers part forever. The girl's pride has had a mortal wound. About  this time is thrown on the screen the kind of a climax quite surely  possible to the photoplay. It reminds one, not of the mood of Poe's  verse, but of the spirit of the paintings of George Frederick Watts. It  is allied in some way, in my mind, with his \"Love and Life,\" though but a  single draped figure within doors, and \"Love and Life\" are undraped  figures, climbing a mountain.    The boy, having said good-by, remembers the lady Annabel. It is a crisis  after the event. In his vision she is shown in a darkened passageway, all  in white, looking out of the window upon the moonlit sky. Simple enough  in its elements, this vision is shown twice in glory. The third replica  has not the same glamour. The first two are transfigurations into  divinity. The phrase thrown on the screen is \"The moon never beams  without bringing me dreams of the beautiful Annabel Lee.\" And the sense  of loss goes through and through one like a flight of arrows. Another  noble picture, more realistic, more sculpturesque, is of Annabel mourning  on her knees in her room. Her bended head makes her akin to \"Niobe, all  tears.\"    The boy meditating on a park-path is meanwhile watching the spider in his  web devour the fly. Then he sees the ants in turn destroy the spider.  These pictures are shown on so large a scale that the spiderweb fills the  end of the theatre. Then the ant-tragedy does the same. They can be  classed as particularly apt hieroglyphics in the sense of chapter  thirteen. Their horror and decorative iridescence are of the Poe sort.  It is the first hint of the Poe hieroglyphic we have had except the black  patch over the eye of the uncle, along with his jaundiced, cadaverous  face. The boy meditates on how all nature turns on cruelty and the  survival of the fittest.    He passes just now an Italian laborer (impersonated by George Seigmann).  This laborer enters later into his dream. He finally goes to sleep in his  chair, the resolve to kill his uncle rankling in his heart.    The audience is not told that a dream begins. To understand that, one  must see the film through twice. But it is perfectly legitimate to  deceive us. Through our ignorance we share the young man's  hallucinations, entering into them as imperceptibly as he does. We think  it is the next morning. Poe would start the story just here, and here the  veritable Poe-esque quality begins.    After debate within himself as to means, the nephew murders his uncle and  buries him in the thick wall of the chimney. The Italian laborer  witnesses the death-struggle through the window. While our consciences  are aching and the world crashes round us, he levies black-mail. Then  for due compensation the Italian becomes an armed sentinel. The boy fears  detection.    Yet the foolish youth thinks he will be happy. But every time he runs to  meet his sweetheart he is appalled by hallucinations over her shoulder.  The cadaverous ghost of the uncle is shown on the screen several times.  It is an appearance visible to the young man and the audience only. Later  the ghost is implied by the actions of the guilty one. We merely imagine  it. This is a piece of sound technique. We no more need a dray full of  ghosts than a dray full of jumping furniture.    The village in general has never suspected the nephew. Only two people  suspect him: the broken-hearted girl and an old friend of his father.  This gentleman puts a detective on the trail. (The detective is  impersonated by Ralph Lewis.) The gradual breakdown of the victim is  traced by dramatic degrees. This is the second case of the thing I have  argued as being generally impossible in a photoplay chronicle of a  private person, and which the considerations of chapter twelve indicate  as exceptional. We trace the innermost psychology of one special citizen  step by step to the crisis, and that path is actually the primary  interest of the story. The climax is the confession to the detective.  With this self-exposure the direct Poe-quality of the technique comes to  an end. Moreover, Poe would end the story here. But the Poe-dream is set  like a dark jewel in a gold ring, of which more anon.    Let us dwell upon the confession. The first stage of this  conscience-climax is reached by the dramatization of The Tell-tale Heart  reminiscence in the memory of the dreaming man. The episode makes a  singular application of the theories with which this chapter begins. For  furniture-in-motion we have the detective's pencil. For trappings and  inventions in motion we have his tapping shoe and the busy clock  pendulum. Because this scene is so powerful the photoplay is described in  this chapter rather than any other, though the application is more  spiritual than literal. The half-mad boy begins to divulge that he thinks  that the habitual ticking of the clock is satanically timed to the  beating of the dead man's heart. Here more unearthliness hovers round a  pendulum than any merely mechanical trick-movements could impart. Then  the merest commonplace of the detective tapping his pencil in the same  time--the boy trying in vain to ignore it--increases the strain, till the  audience has well-nigh the hallucinations of the victim. Then the bold  tapping of the detective's foot, who would do all his accusing without  saying a word, and the startling coincidence of the owl hoot-hooting  outside the window to the same measure, bring us close to the final  breakdown. These realistic material actors are as potent as the actual  apparitions of the dead man that preceded them. Those visions prepared  the mind to invest trifles with significance. The pencil and the pendulum  conducting themselves in an apparently everyday fashion, satisfy in a far  nobler way the thing in the cave-man attending the show that made him  take note in other centuries of the rope that began to hang the butcher,  the fire that began to burn the stick, and the stick that began to beat  the dog.    Now the play takes a higher demoniacal plane reminiscent of Poe's Bells.  The boy opens the door. He peers into the darkness. There he sees them.  They are the nearest to the sinister Poe quality of any illustrations I  recall that attempt it. \"They are neither man nor woman, they are neither  brute nor human; they are ghouls.\" The scenes are designed with the  architectural dignity that the first part of this chapter has insisted  wizard trappings should take on. Now it is that the boy confesses and the  Poe story ends.    Then comes what the photoplay people call the punch. It is discussed at  the end of chapter nine. It is a kind of solar plexus blow to the  sensibilities, certainly by this time an unnecessary part of the film.  Usually every soul movement carefully built up to where the punch begins  is forgotten in the material smash or rescue. It is not so bad in this  case, but it is a too conventional proceeding for Griffith.    The boy flees interminably to a barn too far away. There is a siege by a  posse, led by the detective. It is veritable border warfare. The Italian  leads an unsuccessful rescue party. The unfortunate youth finally hangs  himself. The beautiful Annabel bursts through the siege a moment too  late; then, heart broken, kills herself. These things are carried out by  good technicians. But it would have been better to have had the suicide  with but a tiny part of the battle, and the story five reels long instead  of six. This physical turmoil is carried into the spiritual world only  by the psychic momentum acquired through the previous confession scene.  The one thing with intrinsic pictorial heart-power is the death of  Annabel by jumping off the sea cliff.    Then comes the awakening. To every one who sees the film for the first  time it is like the forgiveness of sins. The boy finds his uncle still  alive. In revulsion from himself, he takes the old man into his arms. The  uncle has already begun to be ashamed of his terrible words, and has  prayed for a contrite heart. The radiant Annabel is shown in the early  dawn rising and hurrying to her lover in spite of her pride. She will  bravely take back her last night's final word. She cannot live without  him. The uncle makes amends to the girl. The three are in the  inconsistent but very human mood of sweet forgiveness for love's sake,  that sometimes overtakes the bitterest of us after some crisis in our  days.    The happy pair are shown, walking through the hills. Thrown upon the  clouds for them are the moods of the poet-lover's heart. They look into  the woods and see his fancies of Spring, the things that he will some day  write. These pageants might be longer. They furnish the great climax.  They make a consistent parallel and contrast with the ghoul-visions that  end with the confession to the detective. They wipe that terror from the  mind. They do not represent Poe.

(_And starts on_.)      GUNTHER.      I'll follow thee!      SIEGFRIED.      Wait, Gunther, wait! What didst thou promise me!      GUNTHER.      May I, my Kriemhild, choose a spouse for thee?      KRIEMHILD.      My lord and brother, be it as thou wilt!      GUNTHER (_to_ UTE).      I have no opposition then to fear?      UTE.      Thou art the king, thy handmaids, she and I.      GUNTHER.      I beg thee then amongst my kinsfolk here:    Redeem an oath for them and me, and give    Thy hand to noble Siegfried.      SIEGFRIED.      I've no power    To speak as I could wish to, when I gaze    Upon thy face, and of my stammering tongue    Perchance thou hast already heard enough.    And so I ask thee as the hunter asks,    But that I blow no feathers from my hat,    To hide my fear: O maiden, wilt thou me?    Yet lest thou err'st through my simplicity,    And unenlightened actest in the dark,    So let me tell thee, ere thou answer'st me,    How my own mother blames me oftentimes.    She says that I am surely strong enough    To conquer all the world, but yet to rule    The smallest molehill I'm too simple far.    And if I do not lose my very eyes    'Tis only that the thing's impossible.    Thou may'st believe the half of what she says,    The other half though, I can well disprove.    For if I once have won thee, I will show    The world how I can keep unharmed mine own.    Again I ask thee: Kriemhild, wilt thou me?      KRIEMHILD.      Why dost thou smile, my mother? I have not    Forgotten what I dreamed, the shudder still    Creeps over me and warns me more and more,    But still I say with dauntless courage: Yes!      BRUNHILDA (_steps between_ KRIEMHILD _and_ SIEGFRIED).      Kriemhild!      KRIEMHILD.      What wilt thou?      BRUNHILDA.      I will prove myself    Thy sister.      KRIEMHILD.      Now? Wherein?      BRUNHILDA (_to_ SIEGFRIED).      How dost thou dare    Aspire to her, the daughter of a king?    How dost thou dare, a vassal such as thou,    A serving man!      SIEGFRIED.      What?      BRUNHILDA.      Cam'st thou not as guide,    As messenger departed?      (_To_ GUNTHER.)      Canst thou suffer    And aid him in such boldness?      GUNTHER.      Siegfried is    The first of all our warriors.      BRUNHILDA.      Grant him then    The foremost seat beside thy very throne.      GUNTHER.      In treasure, he is richer far than I.      BRUNHILDA.      Is that his claim upon thy sister? Shame!      GUNTHER.      A thousand of my enemies he's slain.      BRUNHILDA.      The man who conquered me thanks him for that?      GUNTHER.      He is a king as I am.      BRUNHILDA.      Yet he ranks    Himself amongst thy servants?      GUNTHER.      I will solve    This riddle for thee when thou art mine own.      BRUNHILDA.      Ere I am thine thy secret will I know.      UTE.      Thou wilt refuse to call me mother then?    Oh tarry not too long, for I am old.    And worn with many sorrows!      BRUNHILDA.      As I swore,    I'll go with him to church, and I will be    Most willingly thy daughter--not his wife.      HAGEN (_to_ FRIGGA).      Pray quiet her!      FRIGGA.      What need is there of me?    For if he once has overcome Brunhild,    The second time he surely will not fail;    And self-defense is every maiden's right.      SIEGFRIED (_taking_ KRIEMHILD _by the hand_).      That all may know me henceforth as a king,    The Niblung's treasure do I give to thee.    And now thy duty and my right I claim.      [_He kisses her_.]      HAGEN.      To church!      FRIGGA.      Does Siegfried hold the Niblung's hoard?      HAGEN.      Thou heard'st! The trumpets!      FRIGGA.      And is Balmung[3] his?      HAGEN.      Why not? Musicians! Wedding music here!      [_Loud and joyful music. Exeunt omnes_.]          SCENE VII      _The great hall. Enter_ TRUCHS _and_ WULF. _Dwarfs bring treasures    across the stage._      TRUCHS.      I am for Kriemhild.      WULF.      And for Brunhild I.      TRUCHS.      And why, if thou wilt tell me?      WULF.      Where would be    The play of rival lances, if we all    Should wear one color?      TRUCHS.      Why, I grant thee that!    The reason is sufficient, otherwise    It were mere madness.      WULF.      Say it not so loud,    For many heroes swear by Brunhild now.      TRUCHS.      They are as different as day and night.      WULF.      Who says they're not? Yet many love the    night.      [_Points to the dwarfs_.]      What are they bringing?      TRUCHS.      It must be the hoard,    The treasure of the Niblungs Siegfried won.    He's called the dwarfs for escort duty here,    And bade them bring the treasure, and I'm told    It is the marriage portion for his bride.      WULF.      Uncanny are these dwarfs, with hollow backs!    But turn one over--there's a kneading trough!      TRUCHS.      And ever with the dragons is their home    Within the earth and in the mountain caves.--    First cousins to the moles they are.      WULF.      But strong!      TRUCHS.      And clever are they too! One need not seek    For mandrakes[4] if one has these dwarfs for    friends.      WULF (_pointing toward the treasure_).      He who owns that needs neither of the two.      TRUCHS.      I love it not. It is an ancient saw    That magic gold is thirstier for blood    Than ever was the driest sponge for water;    And, more than all, the Niblung heroes tell    The strangest tales!      WULF.      Of ravens was the talk.    What was it then? I heard it not aright.      TRUCHS.      A raven flew and lit upon the gold,    When it was carried to the ship, and there    He croaked till Siegfried, who could understand,    At first stopped up his ears and would not hear,    And whistled. Then the precious stones he threw    To drive the bird, and when it would not fly,    At last in desperation cast his spear.      WULF.      Why, that is strange! For Siegfried is at heart    As gentle as he's brave.      [_Horns are heard._]      They call for us!    They're gath'ring! Ho, Brunhilda!      TRUCHS.      Kriemhild, ho!      [_Exeunt. Other warriors, who meanwhile have assembled,    join them and repeat the cry. It grows dark gradually._]          SCENE VIII      _Enter HAGEN and SIEGFRIED._      SIEGFRIED.      But Hagen! Why didst thou make signs to me    To leave the banquet? I shall nevermore    Sit at this table as I sit today.    Pray grant me this one day, I only ask    A just reward.      HAGEN.      Your task is not yet done.      SIEGFRIED.      Let be till morning, for a minute's worth    A year today. I still can count the words    That I have spoken to my loving bride;    Then let me have one evening with my wife.      HAGEN.      Without good reason I will ne'er disturb    A lover or a drunkard. It avails    No longer to resist! What Brunhild said    Thou'st heard, and now her wedding gayety    Thou may'st behold, for at the feast she weeps!      SIEGFRIED.      And can I dry her tears?      HAGEN.      She'll keep her word,    The threat that she has sworn, there is no doubt;    That endless shame would follow may we doubt    Still less. Dost thou not understand me now?      SIEGFRIED.      What follows them      HAGEN.      That thou must conquer her.      [_GUNTHER approaches._]      SIEGFRIED.      What, I?      HAGEN.      Now listen! Gunther goes with her    Into the chamber.[5] In the Tarnhelm thou    Must follow. Quickly he demands a kiss    Ere she has raised her veil.--She grants it not.    He grapples with her.--She laughs mockingly.    He quenches, as by accident, the light--    Exclaims: So much is jest, 'tis earnest now.    It will not be on shore as on the ship!    Then shalt thou seize her and so master her    That she shall beg for mercy and for life.    And when thy part is done, then shall the king    Demand her oath to be his humblest maid,    And thou shalt vanish as thou cam'st.      GUNTHER.      Wilt thou    But do me this one service now, my friend,    I vow I'll never ask thee then for more.      HAGEN.      He must and will. The task he has begun,    How should he then not finish?      SIEGFRIED.      If I would!    For truly you demand a deed from me    That I might well refuse another time    Than on my wedding day to do for you--    How could I pray? What should I tell Kriemhild?    She has so much already to forgive,    The very ground is hot beneath my feet.    Should I repeat the misdeed once again    She never could forgive me in her life.      HAGEN.      When a young daughter from her mother parts    And leaves the room where once the cradle stood,    Into the bridal chamber she must pass,    The farewell is a long one, know my friend.    There's time enough for thee, and so--agreed!      (_As SIEGFRIED refuses his hand._)      Brunhilda now is like a wounded deer,    Who'd let it with the arrow run away?    A noble hunter sends the second shaft.    The lost is ever lost, nor may return.    The haughty heiress of the Valkyries    And Norns is dying. Give the final stroke!    A happy woman laughs tomorrow morn    And only says: I had a troubled dream!      SIEGFRIED.      I know not, something warns me.      HAGEN.      Will Frau Ute    Be ready ere thou art? Nay, there's no fear,    For three times yet will she call Kriemhild back    To bless her and embrace her.      SIEGFRIED.      I refuse.      HAGEN.      What? If this moment came a messenger    In haste announcing that thy father lay    Sick unto death, would'st thou not call at once    For thy good steed? And surely would thy bride    Speed thy departure! Yet a father may,    Though old, recover. Honor wounded once    By cruel wrong, nor mended speedily,    Will never from the dead be raised again.    The honor of the king's the guiding star    Which brings or light or darkness to the knights,    As to the king himself. O woe to him    Who hesitates and robs him of one ray.    Had I thy strength I'd sue to thee no more,    But do the deed myself with pride"]]]
