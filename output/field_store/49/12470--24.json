[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1354"],[0,"Chronicles of Avonlea (#19)"],[1," stubborn breed!\"    She flung her train out straight and pulled on her gloves.    \"I do hope I won't get any spots on this dress to-night,\" she reflected.  \"It will have to do me for a gala dress for a year at least--and I have  a creepy conviction that it is fearfully spottable. Bless Uncle Mark's  good, uncalculating heart! How I would have detested it if he had given  me something sensible and useful and ugly--as Aunt Emilia would have  done.\"    They all went to \"young\" John Penhallow's at early moonrise. Lucinda  drove over the two miles of hill and dale with a youthful second cousin,  by name, Carey Penhallow. The wedding was quite a brilliant affair.  Lucinda seemed to pervade the social atmosphere, and everywhere she went  a little ripple of admiration trailed after her like a wave. She was  undeniably a belle, yet she found herself feeling faintly bored and was  rather glad than otherwise when the guests began to fray off.    \"I'm afraid I'm losing my capacity for enjoyment,\" she thought, a little  drearily. \"Yes, I must be growing old. That is what it means when social  functions begin to bore you.\"    It was that unlucky Mrs. George who blundered again. She was standing on  the veranda when Carey Penhallow dashed up.    \"Tell Lucinda that I can't take her back to the Grange. I have to  drive Mark and Cissy Penhallow to Bright River to catch the two o'clock  express. There will be plenty of chances for her with the others.\"    At this moment George Penhallow, holding his rearing horse with  difficulty, shouted for his wife. Mrs. George, all in a flurry, dashed  back into the still crowded hall. Exactly to whom she gave her message  was never known to any of the Penhallows. But a tall, ruddy-haired girl,  dressed in pale green organdy--Anne Shirley from Avonlea--told Marilla  Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde as a joke the next morning how a chubby little  woman in a bright pink fascinator had clutched her by the arm, and  gasped out: \"Carey Penhallow can't take you--he says you're to look out  for someone else,\" and was gone before she could answer or turn around.    Thus it was that Lucinda, when she came out to the veranda step, found  herself unaccountably deserted. All the Grange Penhallows were gone;  Lucinda realized this after a few moments of bewildered seeking, and  she understood that if she were to get to the Grange that night she must  walk. Plainly there was nobody to take her.    Lucinda was angry. It is not pleasant to find yourself forgotten and  neglected. It is still less pleasant to walk home alone along a country  road, at one o'clock in the morning, wearing a pale green voile. Lucinda  was not prepared for such a walk. She had nothing on her feet save  thin-soled shoes, and her only wraps were a flimsy fascinator and a  short coat.    \"What a guy I shall look, stalking home alone in this rig,\" she thought  crossly.    There was no help for it, unless she confessed her plight to some of the  stranger guests and begged a drive home. Lucinda's pride scorned such  a request and the admission of neglect it involved. No, she would walk,  since that was all there was to it; but she would not go by the main  road to be stared at by all and sundry who might pass her. There was a  short cut by way of a lane across the fields; she knew every inch of it,  although she had not traversed it for years.    She gathered up the green voile as trimly as possible, slipped around  the house in the kindly shadows, picked her way across the side lawn,  and found a gate which opened into a birch-bordered lane where the  frosted trees shone with silvery-golden radiance in the moonlight.  Lucinda flitted down the lane, growing angrier at every step as the  realization of how shamefully she seemed to have been treated came home  to her. She believed that nobody had thought about her at all, which was  tenfold worse than premeditated neglect.    As she came to the gate at the lower end of the lane a man who was  leaning over it started, with a quick intake of his breath, which, in  any other man than Romney Penhallow, or for any other woman than Lucinda  Penhallow, would have been an exclamation of surprise.    Lucinda recognized him with a great deal of annoyance and a little  relief. She would not have to walk home alone. But with Romney  Penhallow! Would he think she had contrived it so purposely?    Romney silently opened the gate for her, silently latched it behind her,  and silently fell into step beside her. Down across a velvety sweep of  field they went; the air was frosty, calm and still; over the world lay  a haze of moonshine and mist that converted East Grafton's prosaic hills  and fields into a shimmering fairyland. At first Lucinda felt angrier  than ever. What a ridiculous situation! How the Penhallows would laugh  over it!    As for Romney, he, too, was angry with the trick impish chance had  played him. He liked being the butt of an awkward situation as little as  most men; and certainly to be obliged to walk home over moonlit fields  at one o'clock in the morning with the woman he had loved and never  spoken to for fifteen years was the irony of fate with a vengeance.  Would she think he had schemed for it? And how the deuce did she come to  be walking home from the wedding at all?    By the time they had crossed the field and reached the wild cherry lane  beyond it, Lucinda's anger was mastered by her saving sense of humour.  She was even smiling a little maliciously under her fascinator.    The lane was a place of enchantment--a long, moonlit colonnade adown  which beguiling wood nymphs might have footed it featly. The moonshine  fell through the arching boughs and made a mosaic of silver light and  clear-cut shadow for the unfriendly lovers to walk in. On either side  was the hovering gloom of the woods, and around them was a great silence  unstirred by wind or murmur.    Midway in the lane Lucinda was attacked by a sentimental recollection.  She thought of the last time Romney and she had walked home together  through this very lane, from a party at \"young\" John's. It had been  moonlight then too, and--Lucinda checked a sigh--they had walked hand  in hand. Just here, by the big gray beech, he had stopped her and kissed  her. Lucinda wondered if he were thinking of it, too, and stole a look  at him from under the lace border of her fascinator.    But he was striding moodily along with his hands in his pockets, and his  hat pulled down over his eyes, passing the old beech without a glance  at it. Lucinda checked another sigh, gathered up an escaped flutter of  voile, and marched on.    Past the lane a range of three silvery harvest fields sloped down to  Peter Penhallow's brook--a wide, shallow stream bridged over in the  olden days by the mossy trunk of an ancient fallen tree. When Lucinda  and Romney arrived at the brook they gazed at the brawling water  blankly. Lucinda remembered that she must not speak to Romney just in  time to prevent an exclamation of dismay. There was no tree! There was  no bridge of any kind over the brook!    Here was a predicament! But before Lucinda could do more than  despairingly ask herself what was to be done now, Romney answered--not  in words, but in deeds. He coolly picked Lucinda up in his arms, as  if she had been a child instead of a full grown woman of no mean  avoirdupois, and began to wade with her through the water.    Lucinda gasped helplessly. She could not forbid him and she was so  choked with rage over his presumption that she could not have spoken  in any case. Then came the catastrophe. Romney's foot slipped on a  treacherous round stone--there was a tremendous splash--and Romney and  Lucinda Penhallow were sitting down in the middle of Peter Penhallow's  brook.    Lucinda was the first to regain her feet. About her clung in  heart-breaking limpness the ruined voile. The remembrance of all her  wrongs that night rushed over her soul, and her eyes blazed in the  moonlight. Lucinda Penhallow had never been so angry in her life.    \"YOU D--D IDIOT!\" she said, in a voice that literally shook with rage.    Romney meekly scrambled up the bank after her.    \"I'm awfully sorry, Lucinda,\" he said, striving with uncertain success  to keep a suspicious quiver of laughter out of his tone. \"It was  wretchedly clumsy of me, but that pebble turned right under my foot.  Please forgive me--for that--and for other things.\"    Lucinda deigned no answer. She stood on a flat stone and wrung the water  from the poor green voile. Romney surveyed her apprehensively.    \"Hurry, Lucinda,\" he entreated. \"You will catch your death of cold.\"    \"I never take cold,\" answered Lucinda, with chattering teeth. \"And it is  my dress I am thinking of--was thinking of. You have more need to hurry.  You are sopping wet yourself and you know you are subject to colds.  There--come.\"    Lucinda picked up the stringy train, which had been so brave and buoyant  five minutes before, and started up the field at a brisk rate. Romney  came up to her and slipped his arm through hers in the old way. For  a time they walked along in silence. Then Lucinda began to shake with  inward laughter. She laughed silently for the whole length of the field;  and at the line fence between Peter Penhallow's land and the Grange  acres she paused, threw back the fascinator from her face, and looked at  Romney defiantly.    \"You are thinking of--THAT,\" she cried, \"and I am thinking of it. And we  will go on, thinking of it at intervals for the rest of our lives. But  if you ever mention it to me I'll never forgive you, Romney Penhallow!\"    \"I never will,\" Romney promised. There was more than a suspicion of  laughter in his voice this time, but Lucinda did not choose to resent  it. She did not speak again until they reached the Grange gate. Then she  faced him solemnly.    \"It was a case of atavism,\" she said. \"Old Grandfather Gordon was to  blame for it.\"    At the Grange almost everybody was in bed.

The rocks vary in size from a few pounds to several  tons in weight. Arriving there, Aunt Sarah said: \"Ralph, you will now  find use for the hammer which I asked you to bring.\" Ralph struck  different rocks with the hammer, and Fritz Schmidt struck rocks with  other pieces of rock, and all gave a peculiar metallic sound, the  tones of each being different. The rocks are piled upon each other to  an unknown depth, not a particle of earth being found between them,  and not a bush or spear of grass to be seen. They occupy a space of  about four and a half acres and are a natural curiosity well worth  seeing. The young folks scrambled over the rocks for a time, and,  having made them ring to their hearts' content, were satisfied to  return to camp and supper.    [Illustration: BIG ROCK AT ROCKY DALE]    \"Not far distant from High Falls,\" said John Landis, when all were  comfortably seated near the table, with a sandwich in hand, \"is a  place called Roaring Rocks, also a freak of nature. I remember, when a  boy, I always went there in the fall of the year, after the first hard  frost, to pick persimmons. The water could he distinctly heard running  underneath the rocks at a considerable depth.\"    Ralph Jackson remarked to Aunt Sarah: \"I never imagined there were so  many interesting, natural features right here in Bucks County.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" exclaimed the impressible Fritz Schmidt, \"we have a few  things besides pigs and potatoes.\"    \"Yes, Ralph,\" said the Professor, \"there are still several places of  interest you will like to see. 'Stony Garden' is another very  interesting freak of nature. It is about two and a half miles from the  small town of 'Snitzbachsville,' as Fritz calls the hamlet, and 'tis a  wild spot. About an acre is covered with trap rock. The stones are of  odd shapes and sizes and appear as if thrown into the forest in the  wildest confusion. No earth or vegetation is found about them. 'Tis  said the rocks are similar to those found at Fingal's Cave, Ireland,  and also at the Palisades on the Hudson, and are not found anywhere  else in this section of the country.\"    \"And Ralph,\" said Fritz, \"I want to show you 'Big Rock,' at Avondale,  where a party of us boys camped one summer for two weeks. Oh! but I  remember the good pies given us by a farmer's wife who sold us milk  and eggs, and who lived just across the fields from our camp.\"    \"I think,\" said John Landis, \"it is time we began hitching up our  horses and starting for home. We have a long drive before us, and,  therefore, must make an early start. Sarah, get the rest of the party  together and pack up your traps.\"    At that moment the Professor came in sight with an armful of ferns,  the rich loam adhering to their roots, and said: \"I'm sure these will  grow.\" Later he planted them on a shady side of the old farm house at  \"Five Oaks,\" where they are growing today. Professor Schmidt, after a  diligent search, had found clinging to a rock a fine specimen of  \"Seedum Rhodiola,\" which he explained had never been found growing in  any locality in the United States except Maine. Little Pauline, with a  handful of flowers and weeds, came trotting after Mary, who carried an  armful of creeping evergreen called partridge berry, which bears  numerous small, bright, scarlet berries later in the season. Ralph  walked by her side with a basket filled to overflowing with quantities  of small ferns and rock moss, with which to border the edge of the  waiter on which Mary intended planting ferns; tree moss or lichens,  hepaticas, wild violets, pipsissewa or false wintergreen, with dark  green, waxy leaves veined with a lighter shade of green; and wild  pink geraniums, the foliage of which is prettier than the pink  blossoms seen later, and they grow readily when transplanted.    Aunt Sarah had taught Mary how to make a beautiful little home-made  fernery. By planting these all on a large waiter, banking moss around  the edges to keep them moist and by planting them early, they would be  growing finely when taken by her to the city in the fall of the  year--a pleasant reminder of her trip to the \"Narrows\" of the Delaware  River. Frau Schmidt brought up the rear, carrying huge bunches of  mint, pennyroyal and the useful herb called \"Quaker Bonnet.\"    [Illustration: THE OLD TOWPATH AT THE NARROWS]    Driving home at the close of the day, the twinkling lights in farm  house windows they swiftly passed, were hailed with delight by the  tired but happy party, knowing that each one brought them nearer home  than the one before. To enliven the drowsy members of the party, Fritz  Schmidt sang the following to the tune of \"My Old Kentucky Home,\"  improvising as he sang:        The moon shines bright on our \"old Bucks County home,\"        The meadows with daisies are gay,      The song of the whipporwill is borne on the breeze,        With the scent of the new mown hay.      Oh! the Narrows are great with their high granite peaks,        And Ringing Rocks for ages the same;      But when daylight fades and we're tired and cold,        There's no place like \"hame, clear alt hame.\"    The last lingering rays of the sun idealized the surrounding fields  and woods with that wonderful afterglow seen only at the close of day.  The saffron moon appeared to rise slowly from behind the distant  tree-tops, and rolled on parallel with them, and then ahead, as if to  guide them on their way, and the stars twinkled one by one from out  the mantle of darkness which slowly enveloped the earth. The trees  they swiftly passed, when the moonbeams touched them, assumed  gigantic, grotesque shapes in the darkness. Mary quoted from a  favorite poem, \"The Huskers,\" by Whittier:        'Till broad and red as when he rose, the sun        Sank down at last,      And, like a merry guest's farewell, the day        In brightness passed.        And lo! as through the western pines,        On meadow, stream and pond,      Flamed the red radiance of a sky,        Set all afire beyond.        Slowly o'er the eastern sea bluffs,        A milder glory shone,      And the sunset and the moon-rise        Were mingled into one!        As thus into the quiet night,        The twilight lapsed away,      And deeper in the brightening moon        The tranquil shadows lay.        From many a brown, old farm house        And hamlet without name,      Their milking and their home tasks done,        The merry huskers came.    \"You mean 'The Merry Picknickers Came,'\" said Fritz Schmidt, as Mary  finished, \"and here we are at home. Good night, all.\"          CHAPTER XIX.    MARY IS TAUGHT TO MAKE PASTRY, PATTIES AND \"ROSEN KUCHEN.\"      Mary's Aunt taught her to make light, flaky pastry and pies of every  description. In this part of Bucks County a young girl's education was  considered incomplete without a knowledge of pie-making. Some of the  commonest varieties of pies made at the farm were \"Rivel Kuchen,\" a  pie crust covered with a mixture of sugar, butter and flour crumbled  together; \"Snitz Pie,\" composed of either stewed dried apples or  peaches, finely mashed through a colander, sweetened, spread over a  crust and this covered with a lattice-work of narrow strips of pastry  laid diamond-wise over the top of the pie; \"Crumb\" pies, very popular  when served for breakfast, made with the addition of molasses or  without it; Cheese pies, made of \"Smier Kase;\" Egg Custard, Pumpkin  and Molasses pie.    Pies were made of all the different fruits and berries which grew on  the farm. When fresh fruits were not obtainable, dried fruits and  berries were used. Pie made from dried, sour cherries was an especial  favorite of Farmer Landis, and raisin or \"Rosina\" pie, as it was  usually called at the farm, also known as \"Funeral\" pie, was a standby  at all seasons of the year, as it was invariably served at funerals,  where, in old times, sumptuous feasts were provided for relatives and  friends, a regular custom for years among the \"Pennsylvania Germans,\"  and I have heard Aunt Sarah say, \"In old times, the wives of the  grave-diggers were always expected to assist with the extra baking at  the house where a funeral was to be held.\"    It would seem as if Bucks County German housewives did not like a  dessert without a crust surrounding it.    The Pennsylvania German farmers' wives, with few exceptions, serve the  greatest variety of pies at a meal of any class of people I know; not  alone as a dessert at twelve o'clock dinner, but frequently serve  several different varieties of pie at breakfast and at each meal  during the day. No ill effects following the frequent eating of pie I  attribute to their active life, the greater part of which, during the  day, was usually spent in the open air, and some credit may he due the  housewife for having acquired the knack of making _good_ pie crust,  which was neither very rich nor indigestible, if such a thing be  possible.    The combination of fruit and pastry called pie is thought to be of  American invention. Material for pies at a trifling cost were  furnished the early settlers in Bucks County by the large supply of  fruit and vegetables which their fertile farms produced, and these  were utilized by the thrifty German housewives, noted for their wise  management and economy.    The Professor's wife taught Mary to make superior pastry, so flaky and  tender as to fairly melt in one's mouth; but Mary never could learn  from her the knack of making a dainty, crimped edge to her pies with  thumb and forefinger, although it looked so very simple when she  watched \"Frau Schmidt\" deftly roll over a tiny edge as a finish to the  pie.    Mary laughingly told the Professor's wife (when speaking of pies) of  the brilliant remark she made about lard, on first coming to the farm.  Her Aunt Sarah, when baking pies "]]]
