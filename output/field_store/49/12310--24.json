Could the  gods themselves, in their solicitude to punish the impious Prometheus,  for having stolen fire from the sun, have imagined a more certain method  of executing their wishes? Was not Pandora's box, though stuffed with  evils, trifling when compared with this? That at least left hope, to the  unfortunate Epimetheus; this effectually cut it off.    If man was subjected to an absolute monarch, to a sultan who should keep  himself secluded from his subjects; who followed no rule but his own  desires; who did not feel himself bound by any duty; who could for ever  punish the offences committed against him; whose fury it was easy  to provoke; who was irritated even by the ideas, the thoughts of his  subjects; whose displeasure might be incurred without even their own  knowledge; the name of such a sovereign would assuredly be sufficient to  carry trouble, to spread terror, to diffuse consternation into the very  souls of those who should hear it pronounced; his idea would haunt them  every where--would unceasingly afflict them--would plunge them into  despair. What tortures would not their mind endure to discover this  formidable being, to ascertain the secret of pleasing him! What labour  would not their imagination bestow, to discover what mode of conduct  might be able to disarm his anger! What fears would assail them, lest  they might not have justly hit upon the means of assuaging his wrath!  What disputes would they not enter into upon the nature, the qualities  of a ruler, equally unknown to them all! What a variety of means would  not be adopted, to find favour in his eyes; to avert his chastisement!    Such is the history of the effects superstition has produced upon the  earth. Man has always been panic-struck, because the systems adopted  never enable him to form any correct opinion, any fixed ideas, upon  a subject so material to his happiness; because every thing conspired  either to give his ideas a fallacious turn, or else to keep his mind in  the most profound ignorance; when he was willing to set himself  right, when he was sedulous to examine the path which conducted to his  felicity, when he was desirous of probing opinions so consequential to  his peace, involving so much mystery, yet combining both his hopes  and his fears, he was forbidden to employ the only proper method,--HIS  REASON, guided by his experience; he was assured this would be an  offence the most indelible. If he asked, Wherefore his reason had then  been given him, since he was not to use it in matters of such high  behest? he was answered, those were mysteries of which none but the  initiated could be informed; that it sufficed for him to know, that  the reason which he seemed so highly to prize, which he held in so  much esteem, was his most dangerous enemy--his most inveterate, most  determined foe. Where can be the propriety of such an argument? Can it  really be that reason is dangerous? If so, the Turks are justified in  their predilection for madmen: but to proceed, he is told that he must  believe in the gods, not question the mission of their priests; in  short, that he had nothing to do with the laws they imposed, but to  obey them: when he then required that these laws might at least be  made comprehensible to him; that he might be placed in a capacity  to understand them; the old answer was returned, that they were  _mysteries_; he must not inquire into them. But where is the necessity  for mystery in points of such vast importance? He might, indeed,  from time to time consult these oracles, when he was able to make the  sacrifices demanded; he would then receive precepts for his conduct:  these were always, however, given in such vague, indeterminate terms,  that he had scarcely the chance of acting right. At different times the  same oracles delivered different opinions: thus he had nothing, steady;  nothing permanent, whereby to guide his steps; like a blind man left to  himself in the streets, he was obliged to grope his way at the peril of  his existence. This will serve to shew the urgent necessity there is  for truth to throw its radiant lustre on systems big with so much  importance; that are so calculated to corroborate the animosities,  to confirm the bitterness of soul, between those whom nature intended  should always act as brothers.    By the magical charms with which these idols were surrounded, the human  species has remained either as if it was benumbed, in a state of stupid  apathy, or else he has become furious with fanaticism: sometimes,  desponding with fear, man cringed like a slave who bends under the  scourge of an inexorable master, always ready to strike him; he trembled  under a yoke made too ponderous for his strength: he lived in continual  dread of a vengeance he was unceasingly striving to appease, without  ever knowing when he had succeeded: as he was always bathed in tears,  continually enveloped in misery--as he was never permitted to lose sight  of his fears--as he was continually exhorted to nourish his alarm, he  could neither labour for his own happiness nor contribute to that of  others; nothing could exhilirate him; he became the enemy of himself,  the persecutor of his fellow-creatures, because his felicity here below  was interdicted; he passed his time in heaving the most bitter sighs;  his reason being forbidden him, he fell into either a state of infancy  or delirium, which submitted him to authority; he was destined to this  servitude from the hour he quitted his mother's womb, until that in  which he was returned to his kindred dust; tyrannical opinion bound him  fast in her massive fetters; a prey to the terrors with which he was  inspired, he appeared to have come upon the earth for no other purpose  than to dream--with no other desire than to groan--with no other motives  than to sigh; his only view seemed to be to injure himself; to deprive  himself of every rational pleasure, to embitter his own existence; to  disturb the felicity of others. Thus, abject, slothful, irrational, he  frequently became wicked, under the idea of doing honour to his gods;  because they instilled into his mind that it was his duty to avenge  their cause, to sustain their honour, to propagate their worship.    Mortals were prostrate from race to race, before vain idols to which  fear had given birth in the bosom of ignorance, during the calamities of  the earth; they tremblingly adored phantoms which credulity had placed  in the recesses of their own brain, where they found a sanctuary which  time only served to strengthen; nothing could undeceive them; nothing  was competent to make them feel, it was themselves they adored--that  they bent the knee before their own work--that they terrified themselves  with the extravagant pictures they had themselves delineated; they  obstinately persisted in prostrating themselves, in perplexing  themselves, in trembling; they even made a crime of endeavouring to  dissipate their fears; they mistook the production of their own folly;  their conduct resembled that of children, who having disfigured their  own features, become afraid of themselves when a mirror reflects the  extravagance they have committed. These notions so afflicting for  themselves, so grievous to others, have their epoch from the calamities  of man; they will continue, perhaps augment, until their mind,  enlightened by discarded reason, illumined by truth, shall set in  their true colours these various systems; until reflection guided by  experience, shall attach no more importance to them, than is consistent  with the happiness of society; until man, bursting the chains of  superstition--recalling to mind the great end of his existence--taking  a rational view of that which surrounds him, shall no longer refuse to  contemplate nature under her true character; shall no longer persist in  refusing to acknowledge she contains within herself the cause of that  wonderful phenomena which strikes on the dazzled optics of man: until  thoroughly persuaded of the weakness of their claim to the homage of  mankind, he shall make one pious, simultaneous, mighty effort, and  _overthrow the altars of Moloch and his priests_.            CHAP. IV.    _Examination of the Proofs of the Existence of the Divinity, as given by  CLARKE._      The unanimity of man in acknowledging the Divinity, is commonly looked  upon as the strongest proof of his existence. There is not, it is said,  any people on the earth who have not some ideas, whether true or false,  of an all-powerful agent who governs the world. The rudest savages  as well as the most polished nations, are equally obliged to recur  by thought to the first cause of every thing that exists; thus it  is affirmed, the cry of Nature herself ought to convince us of the  existence of the Godhead, of which she has taken pains to engrave the  notion in the minds of men: they therefore conclude, that the idea of  God is innate.    Perhaps there is nothing of which man should be more sedulously careful  than permitting a promiscuous assemblage of right with wrong--of  suffering false conclusions to be drawn from true propositions;  this will not improbably be found to be pretty much the case in this  instance; the existence of the great _Cause of causes_, the _Parent of  parents_, does not, I think, admit of any doubt in the mind of any  one who has reasoned: but, if this existence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#18)"],[1,"miles, within twelve miles of Termination Hill. The country  for ten miles before we halted was very good.    Sunday, 3rd July. Rounded Termination Hill, and arrived at Mr. Glen's  station.      JOURNAL OF MR. STUART'S THIRD EXPEDITION (IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE  TORRENS). NOVEMBER, 1859, TO JANUARY, 1860.    Friday, 4th November, 1859. Started from Chambers Creek for the Emerald  Spring. At ten miles crossed nine fresh horse-tracks going eastward; I  supposed them to be those of His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief. I have  not as yet seen his outward track. Arrived at the spring before sundown.    Saturday, 5th November, Emerald Spring. Started at 7.30 on a course of  340 degrees. At seven miles and a half changed to 38 degrees, for three  miles to a high sand hill, from which I could see two salt lagoons, one  to the south and the other to the north; examined them, but could find no  springs. Next bearing, 18 degrees, to clear the lagoon, two miles and a  half sandy, with salt bush and grass. Changed to our first bearing, 340  degrees, for six miles, and then to 350 degrees, for five miles, when we  reached the top of a high hill, from which we could see the lake lying to  the north of us about three miles distant. Changed to 315 degrees for  three miles and a half to get a good view of the lake. This is a large  bay; from north-east to north-west there is nothing visible but the dark,  deep blue line of the horizon. To the north-north-east there is an island  very much resembling Boston Island (Port Lincoln) in shape; to the east  of it there is a point of land coming from the mainland. To the  north-north-west are, apparently, two small islands. A short distance to  the east of the horn of the bay there seems to be much white sand or salt  for two or three miles from the beach towards the blue water (on this  side of which there is a white line as if it were surf): this again  appears at the shores of the island, and also at the horn of the bay.  From the south shore to the island the distance is great; I should say  about twenty-five miles, but it is very difficult to judge correctly. At  three miles and a half camped at sundown, without water.    Sunday, 6th November, Lake Eyre. Got up before daybreak to get the first  glimpse of the lake, to see if there is any land on the horizon, and,  with a powerful telescope, can see none. It has the same appearance as I  described last night. I watched it for some time after sunrise, and it  still continued the same. After breakfast went to examine the shore:  course north, two miles and a half; found it to be caked with salt, with  ironstone and lime gravel. When flooded, at about fifty yards from the  hard beach, the water will be about three feet deep. I tried to ride to  the water, but found it too soft, so I dismounted and tried it on foot.  At about a quarter of a mile I came upon a number of small fish, all  dried and caked in salt; they seem to have been left on the receding of  the waters, or driven on shore by a heavy storm; they were scattered over  a surface of twelve yards in breadth all along the shore; very few,  especially of the larger ones, were perfect. I succeeded in obtaining  three as nearly perfect as possible; one measured eight inches by three,  one six inches by two and a half, and another five inches by two. They  resemble the bream. I should think this a sufficient proof of the depth  of the water. I then proceeded towards the water, but the ground became  soft, and the clay was so very tenacious and my feet so heavy, that it  was with difficulty I could move them, and so I was obliged to return.  The salt is about three inches thick, and underneath it is clay. I would  have tried it in some other places, but as my horses were without water  (and as I intend to visit this place again), I think it more prudent to  search for water for them, and, if I cannot find any, to return to the  camp. Started on a south course to examine the country for springs. At  six miles found we were running parallel to sand ridges, and no chance of  water. Changed to 160 degrees, crossed a number of sand ridges, but no  water, except a little rain water that we found in a hole. Proceeded to  the camp, and arrived there about sundown.    Monday, 7th November, Emerald Springs. Finding that the weevil is at work  with my dried beef, I must remain to-day and put it to rights. Prepared a  package with the fish, etc., to be left for Mr. Barker when he comes  here, to be sent to town. There are fish in this spring about three  inches long. We have also found a cold-water spring among the warm ones.    Tuesday, 8th November, Emerald Springs. Not being satisfied about one of  the lagoons I saw yesterday, I have sent Kekwick and Muller to see if  there are any springs, while I and the others proceed to the Beresford  Springs; they are to overtake me. Arrived at the springs at 3 p.m. We  could find no fresh water on our way, but plenty of salt and brackish in  the creek which we first struck at six miles from the Emerald Springs.  Sundown: the two men have not come up; they must have found something to  detain them; they had only to do about eight miles more than I had. I  expect they will arrive during the night.    Wednesday, 9th November, Beresford Springs. No signs of the two men; they  must have stopped at some water during the night. It is very tiresome to  be delayed in this way: what can they be about? At 12 noon they arrived;  they had passed my tracks and gone on to Mount Hugh instead of coming on  here. I will give their horses an hour's rest and go on to the Strangway  Springs. The Paisley Ponds are dry, but there is salt and brackish water  three miles lower down the creek. Started at 2 p.m., and at 5 p.m.  arrived at the springs, which are about ten miles from the Beresford.  They are upon a high hill about one hundred feet above the level of the  plains; there are a great number of them, and abundance of water, but  very much impregnated with salt and soda. My eyes are very bad.    Thursday, 10th November, Strangway Springs. Suffering very much from bad  eyes and the effects of the water of these springs; cannot help it, but  must go and examine the country to north-west and west. Sent Muller to  the east in search of springs, with instructions to strike my former  tracks and examine all the country between. Started at 7 a.m. with one  man, on a course of 315 degrees, and at one mile crossed a salt creek  with water; at three miles the sand hills commenced, crossing our course  at right angles. At 2 p.m. struck a large lagoon (salt) about two miles  broad and five miles long, running north-east and south-west, narrowing  at the ends; distance, fourteen miles; tried to cross it but found it too  boggy; rounded it on the south-west point, where we discovered a spring;  no surface water, but soft, and the same all round for about two acres  square, covered with grass reeds of a very dark colour and very thick,  showing the presence of water underneath. Proceeded round the lagoon to a  high hill, which seemed to have reeds upon the top of it; after a good  deal of bogging and crossing the bends of the lagoon, we arrived at the  hill, and found it to be very remarkable. Its colour is dark-green from  the reeds and rushes and water-grass which cover it. It is upwards of one  hundred feet high, the lower part red sand; but a little higher up is a  course of limestone. On the top is a black soil, sand and clay, through  and over which the water trickles, and then filters through the sand into  the lagoon. Where the water is, on the top, it is upwards of one hundred  feet long. Immense numbers of tracks of emus and wild dogs, also some  native tracks, all fresh. On the north-west side there is one solitary  gum-tree, and about half a mile in the same direction is another bed of  reeds, and a spring with water in it. All the banks round the lagoon are  of a spongy nature. I am very glad I have found this; it will be another  day's stage with water nearer to the Spring of Hope. We can now make that  in one day, if we can get an early start. By the discovery of springs on  this trip, the road can now be travelled to the furthest water that I saw  on my last trip from Adelaide, and not be a night without water for the  horses. The country to the south and south-east of the last springs  (which I have named the William Springs, after the youngest son of John  Chambers, Esquire), is sand hills and valleys, rich in grass and other  food for cattle. Thence I proceeded to hill bearing 10 degrees south of  north, distant three miles, from the top of which I could see no rising  ground to the westward, nothing but sand hills. Changed my course to  south, to a white place under some stony hills; at ten miles reached it,  and found it to be a salt creek, but no springs. The last ten miles were  through hills not so high as those I crossed on my way out, but more  broken, with plenty of feed. It is my intention to push for the Strangway  Springs tonight, so as to get an early start in the morning. Arrived at  10 p.m., found that one of the horses had not been seen all day;  something always does go wrong when I am away; I shall have to make a  search for him in the morning. My eyes very bad from the effects of the  glare of the sun on the sand hills, and the heat reflected from them, and  that everlasting torment, the flies.    Friday, 11th November, Strangway Springs. My eyes so bad I cannot see;  unable to go myself in search of the missing horse; despatched two of the  men at daybreak to circuit the spring, and cut her tracks if she has left  them. They have returned, but can see no tracks leaving the spring; she  must be concealed among the reeds; sent three men to examine them. They  found her at 1 p.m. Started at 2 p.m., and arrived at William Springs at  sundown. Distance, fourteen miles. By keeping a little more to the east,  the sand hills can nearly be avoided,"]]]
