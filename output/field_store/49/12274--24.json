The northernmost of these  islands is called by the natives Eaheinomauwe, and the southernmost  Tovy, or Tavai Poenammoo. It is not, however, certain, whether the  whole southern island, or only part of it, is comprehended under the  latter name.    Tovy Poenammoo is principally a mountainous, and to all appearance a  barren country. The only inhabitants and signs of inhabitants that  were discovered upon all the islands, were the people whom our  voyagers saw in Queen Charlotte's Sound, some that came off to them  under the snowy mountains, and several fires which were discerned to  the west of Cape Saunders. Eaheinomauwe has a much better appearance.  Though it is not only hilly but mountainous, even the hills and  mountains are covered with wood, and every valley has a rivulet of  water. The soil in these valleys and in the plains, many of which are  not overgrown with wood, is in general light, but fertile. It was the  opinion of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, as well as of the other  gentlemen on board, that all kinds of European grain, plants, and  fruit would flourish here in the utmost luxuriance. There is reason to  conclude, from the vegetables which our navigators found in  Eaheinomauwe, that the winters are milder than those in England; and  the summer was experienced not to be hotter, though it was more  equally warm. If this country, therefore, should be settled by people  from Europe, they might, with a little industry, very soon be supplied  in great abundance, not merely with the necessaries, but even with the  luxuries of life.    In Eaheinomauwe there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats. At least,  no other were seen by our voyagers; and the rats are so scarce that  they wholly escaped the notice of many on board. Of birds the species  are not numerous; and of these no one kind, excepting perhaps the  gannet, is exactly the same with those of Europe. Insects are not in  greater plenty than birds. The sea makes abundant recompense for this  scarcity of animals upon the land. Every creek swarms with fish, which  are not only wholesome, but equally delicious with those in our part  of the world. The Endeavour seldom anchored in any station, or with a  light gale passed any place, that did not afford enough, with hook and  line, to serve the whole ship's company. If the seine were made use of  it seldom failed of producing a still more ample supply. The highest  luxury of this kind, with which the English were gratified was the  lobster, or sea cray-fish. Among the vegetable productions of the  country, the trees claim a principal place; there being forests of  vast extent full of the straightest, the cleanest, and the largest  timber Mr. Cook and his friends had ever seen. Mr. Banks and Dr.  Solander were gratified by the novelty, if not by the variety of the  plants. Out of about four hundred species, there were not many which  had hitherto been described by botanists. There is one plant that  serves the natives instead of hemp and flax, and which excels all that  are applied to the same purposes in other countries.    If the settling of New Zealand should ever be deemed an object  deserving the attention of Great Britain, our commander thought that  the best place for establishing a colony would either be on the banks  of the Thames, or in the territory adjoining to the Bay of Islands.  Each of these places possess the advantage of an excellent harbour. By  means of the river, settlements might be extended, and a communication  established with the inland parts of the country. Vessels might  likewise be built of the fine timber which is every where to be met  with, at very little trouble and expense.    But I am in danger of forgetting myself, and of running into a detail  which may be thought rather to exceed the intentions of the present  narrative. It is difficult to restrain the pen, when such a variety of  curious and entertaining matter lies before it; and I must entreat the  indulgence of my readers while I mention two or three further  particulars. One circumstance peculiarly worthy of notice, is the  perfect and uninterrupted health of the inhabitants of New Zealand. In  all the visits made to their towns, where old and young, men and  women, crowded about our voyagers, they never observed a single person  who appeared to have any bodily complaint; nor among the numbers that  were seen naked, was once perceived the slightest eruption upon the  skin, or the least mark which indicated that such an eruption had,  formerly existed. Another proof of the health of these people is the  facility with which the wounds they at any time receive are healed. In  the man who had been shot with a musket ball through the fleshy part  of his arm, the wound seemed to be so well digested, and in so fair a  way of being perfectly healed, that if Mr. Cook had not known that no  application had been made to it, he declared that he certainly should  have inquired, with a very interested curiosity, after the vulnerary  herbs and surgical art of the country. An additional evidence of human  nature's being untainted with disease in New Zealand, is the great  number of old men with whom it abounds. Many of them, by the loss of  their hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient and yet none of them  were decrepid. Although they were not equal to the young in muscular  strength, they did not come in the least behind them with regard to  cheerfulness and vivacity. Water, as far as our navigators could  discover, is the universal and only liquor of the New Zealanders. It  is greatly to be wished, that their happiness in this respect may  never be destroyed by such a connexion with the European nations, as  shall introduce that fondness for spirituous liquors, which hath been  so fatal to the Indians of North America.    From the observations which Lieutenant Cook and his friends made on  the people of New Zealand, and from the similitude which was discerned  between them and the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, a strong  proof arose, that both of them had one common origin; and this proof  was rendered indubitable by the conformity of their language. When  Tupia addressed himself to the natives of Eaheinomauwe and Poenammoo,  he was perfectly understood. Indeed it did not appear that the  language of Otaheite differed more from that of New Zealand, than the  language of the two islands into which it is divided, did from each  other.    Hitherto the navigation of Lieutenant Cook had been unfavourable to  the notion of a southern continent; having swept away at least  three-fourths of the positions upon which that notion had been  founded. The track of the Endeavour had demonstrated, that the land  seen by Tasman, Juan Fernandes, Hermite, the commander of a Dutch  squadron, Quiros, and Roggewein, was not, as they had supposed, part  of such a continent. It had also totally destroyed the theoretical  arguments in favour of a southern continent, which had been drawn from  the necessity of it to preserve an equilibrium between the two  hemispheres. As, however, Mr. Cook's discoveries, so far as he had  already proceeded, extended only to the northward of forty degrees,  south latitude, he could not therefore give an opinion concerning what  land might lie farther to the southward. This was a matter, therefore,  which he earnestly wished to be examined; and to him at length was  reserved the honour, as we shall hereafter see, of putting a final end  to the question.    On Saturday the 31st of March, our commander sailed from Cape Farewell  in New Zealand, and pursued his voyage to the westward. New Holland,  or as it is now called, New South Wales, came in sight on the 19th of  April; and on the 28th of that month the ship anchored in Botany Bay.  On the preceding day, in consequence of its falling calm when the  vessel was not more than a mile and a half from the shore and within  some breakers, our navigators had been in a very disagreeable  situation; but happily a light breeze had sprung from the land, and  carried them out of danger.    In the afternoon the boats were manned; and Lieutenant Cook and his  friends, having Tupia of their party, set out from the Endeavour. They  intended to land where they had seen some Indians, and began to hope,  that as these Indians had paid no regard to the ship when she came  into the bay, they would be as inattentive to the advances of the  English towards the shore. In this, however, the gentlemen were  disappointed: for as soon as they approached the rocks, two of the men  came down upon them to dispute their landing, and the rest ran away.  These champions, who were armed with lances about ten feet long,  called to our navigators in a very loud tone, and in a harsh dissonant  language, of which even Tupia did not understand a single word. At the  same time, they brandished their weapons, and seemed resolved to  defend their coast to the utmost, though they were but two to forty.  The lieutenant, who could not but admire their courage, and who was  unwilling that hostilities should commence with such inequality of  force on their side, ordered his boat to lie upon her oars. He and the  other gentlemen then parlied with them by signs; and to obtain their  good-will, he threw them nails, beads, and several trifles besides,  with which they appeared to be well pleased. After this our commander  endeavoured to make them understand that he wanted water, and  attempted to convince them by all the methods in his power, that he  had no injurious designs against them. Being willing to interpret the  waving of their hands as an invitation to proceed, the boat put in to  the shore; but no sooner was this perceived, than it was opposed by  the two Indians, one of whom seemed to be a youth about nineteen or  twenty years old, and the other a man of middle age. The only measure  now left for Mr. Cook was to fire a musket between them which being  done, the youngest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#18)"],[1," my friends. 5. Good morning! Did you  come to study geometry, or the German language? 6. Which of these is  usually more difficult, and in which will the examination be the longer?  7. Well, we brought our German books, because we prefer to study these.  8. We wish to know this language thoroughly. 9. We shall go into the  writing-room (111), for (83) some friends of my grandmother are in the  parlor. 10. We can hear their voices here, and we can not study very  well while they are talking. 11. They were carrying many flowers, and  gave a beautiful bouquet to my grandmother. 12. She said \"Many thanks  for (86) the sweet violets! In whose garden did they bloom?\" 13. Her  friend's granddaughter is a friend of my youngest sister. 14. Well,  shall we begin to study? Have you enough paper, and have you a good pen?  15. I shall close this other door, because they are baking bread in the  kitchen, and cooking meat. 16. We shall be hearing the voices of so many  persons that I know that we can not study.                                      LESSON XXVI.                         THE INTERROGATIVE ADVERB OF PLACE.    118. The interrogative adverb of place, related to the interrogative  pronoun \"kiu\" is \"kie\", where, in (at) what place. If the verb in the  sentence expresses motion toward the place indicated by \"kie\", the  ending \"-n\" is added, forming \"kien\", whither (where):       Kie li estis kaj kien oni forpelis lin?        Where was he and whither did they drive him (away)?     Li miros kie lia nepo estas. He will wonder where his grandson is.     Mi ne scias kien li kuris. I do not know where (whither) he ran.                            THE PAST ACTIVE PARTICIPLE.    119. The past active participle, (for the characteristics of a  participle see 108) expressing what the word modified \"did\" or \"has  done\", ends in \"-inta\", as \"vidinta\", having seen, \"irinta\", gone,  having gone:       La falintaj folioj estas brunaj. The fallen leaves are brown.     Kiu estas la viro salutinta nin?        Who is the man having greeted (who greeted) us?     Oni forgesas la foririntajn personojn.        One forgets the departed persons (the persons who have gone away).                        ADVERB DERIVATION FROM PREPOSITIONS.    120. Adverbs may be derived from prepositions whose sense permits, by  use of the adverb ending \"-e\":       Antauxe li studis la geometrion, previously he studied geometry.     Poste li studis la germanan, afterwards he studied German.     Li marsxis antauxe, ne malantauxe, he walked in front, not behind.     Dume la viroj staris cxirkauxe, meanwhile the men stood roundabout.     Ili venis kune kaj sidis apude, they came together and sat near by.                      ADVERBS EXPRESSING DIRECTION OF MOTION.    121. An adverb expressing place or direction is given the ending \"-n\"  when used with a verb expressing motion toward that place or direction  (69, 118, etc.):       Cxu li rajdis norden aux suden? Did he ride north or south(ward)?     Ni kuris antauxen, ne malantauxen, we ran forward, not back.     La bukedo falis eksteren kaj suben,        the bouquet fell out and underneath.     Li estis marsxanta hejmen, he was walking home (homeward).    [Footnote: The adverb may precede the verb and be united with it by  simple juxtaposition, if the resulting word is not too long: \"Li  hejmeniris\", he went home (he \"home-went\"). \"Ni antauxeniros\", we  shall advance (go forward). \"La bukedo subenfalis\", the bouquet fell  underneath.]                                 THE SUFFIX \"-EG-\".    122. The suffix \"-eg-\" may be added to a root to augment or intensify  its meaning, thus forming an \"augmentative\" of the root:       barelego, hogshead (from \"barelo\", barrel).     bonega, excellent (from \"bona\", good).     malbonege, wickedly, wretchedly (from \"malbone\", badly, poorly).     domego, mansion (from \"domo\", house).     ploregi, to sob, to wail (from \"plori\", to weep).     treege, exceedingly (from \"tre\", very).                                     VOCABULARY       aer-o = air.                       pez-a = heavy.     danc-i = to dance.                 polv-o = dust.     fulm-o = lightning.                sekv-i = to follow.     gut-o = drop (of water, etc.).     sercx-i = to hunt for, to search.     kie = where (118).                 silent-a = still, silent.     okaz-i = to happen, to occur.      subit-a = sudden.     okul-o = eye.                      tegment-o = roof.     pec-o = piece.                     tondr-o = thunder.                                    LA PLUVEGO.    Nu, kia pluvego okazis hieraux vespere! Post kvieta varmega mateno,  subite multaj nuboj kovris la cxielon. La aero sxajnis peza, kaj estis  tute silenta kelkan tempon. Tiam forte blovanta vento frapegis la  arbojn, kaj komencis fortege skui la brancxojn. Multege da polvo kaj  malgrandaj pecoj da papero dancis kaj flugis cxirkauxen en la aero, kaj  ankaux cxielen. Falis tiam kelkaj grandaj gutoj da pluvo, kaj ni sciis  ke la pluvego estas venanta. Ni malfermis niajn ombrelojn, kaj kuris  antauxen, por iri hejmen antaux ol falos multe da pluvo. La fulmo tiel  ofte brilis ke ni fermis la okulojn pro gxi, kaj treege gxin timis.  Preskaux tuj la tondro sekvis gxin. Tondris tiom kaj tiel lauxtege ke la  bruo sxajnis frapi kontraux niajn kapojn. Tiam komencis subite pluvegi,  sed je tiu tempo ni estis preskaux sub la tegmento de nia domo. Dume la  vento pli kaj pli blovegis, kaj ju pli forte gxi blovis, des pli peze  la gutoj da pluvo falis teren, kun multege da bruo. Mi opinias ke mi  malofte antauxe vidis tian pluvegon. La sekvintan tagon mi promenis tre  frue, kaj vidis ke la pordego al la gxardeno de mia avo estas kusxanta  sur la tero. Apude mi vidis ventoflagon falintan de la tegmento de tiu  granda cxevalejo. Velkintaj floroj kusxis sur la tero cxirkaux mi, kaj  inter ili estis brancxoj falintaj de la arboj, cxar la grandega forto  de la vento forrompis ecx cxi tiujn. Sur malgranda brancxo restis  nesto, sed kie estis la birdoj! Mi sercxis la junajn birdojn sed tute  ne povis trovi ilin, tial mi opinias ke ili forflugis antaux ol la  ventoj forrompis de la arbo ilian malgrandan hejmon. Mi ne scias kien  ili flugis, sed mi opinias ke ili flugis suden al la arboj en tiu granda  kampo trans la rivero.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. While we were walking home (121) from school yesterday, it rained  very suddenly. 2. What a storm it was! 3.

The interrogative temporal adverb, related to the interrogative  pronoun \"kiu\", is \"kiam\", when, at what time?       Kiam li sercxos min? When will he look for me?     Oni miras kiam li venos, they wonder when he is coming (will come).     Kiam falis tiuj gutoj da pluvo? When did those drops of rain fall?                                 THE PERFECT TENSE.    124. The compound tense formed by using the past active participle  with the present tense of \"esti\" is called the \"perfect tense\". It  differs from the aoristic past tense (35) and from the imperfect (113)  by expressing an act or condition as definitely completed or perfected.  The conjugation of \"vidi\" in the perfect tense is as follows:       mi estas vidinta, I have seen (I am having-seen).     vi estas vidinta, you have seen (you are having-seen).     li (sxi, gxi) estas vidinta, he (she, it) has seen (is having-seen).     ni estas vidintaj, we have seen (we are having-seen).     vi estas vidintaj, you have seen (you are having-seen).     ili estas vidintaj, they have seen (they are having-seen).                             THE PREPOSITION \"CXE\".    125. The general situation of a person, object or action is expressed by  the use of the preposition \"cxe\", at, at the house of, in the region or  land of, among, with, etc.:       Li staris silente cxe la pordego, he stood silently at the gate.     Li logxas cxe mia avo, he lives (dwells) at my grandfather's.     Ili estas cxe la lernejo, they are at the school.     Li restos cxe amikoj, he will stay with (at the house of) friends.     Li vizitos cxe ni morgaux, he will visit at-our-house tomorrow.                                 THE SUFFIX \"-AR-\".    126. Words expressing a collection, group or assemblage of similar  persons or things, as \"forest\" (collection of trees), \"army\" (assemblage  of soldiers), etc., may be formed by the use of the suffix \"-ar-\". This  suffix may itself be used as a root to form \"aro\", \"group, flock\", etc.,  \"are\", in a group, by throngs, etc. Words formed with the suffix \"-ar-\"  are called collectives:       arbaro, forest (from arbo, tree).     cxevalaro, herd of horses (from cxevalo, horse).     kamparo, country (from kampo, field).     libraro, collection of books, library (from libro, book)."]]]
