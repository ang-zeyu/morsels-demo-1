Chapter Seventeen    The Workshop of Ku-Klip      It was not more than a two hours' journey to the house where Nimmie  Amee had lived, but when our travelers arrived there they found the  place deserted. The door was partly off its hinges, the roof had fallen  in at the rear and the interior of the cottage was thick with dust. Not  only was the place vacant, but it was evident that no one had lived  there for a long time.    \"I suppose,\" said the Scarecrow, as they all stood looking wonderingly  at the ruined house, \"that after the Wicked Witch was destroyed, Nimmie  Amee became lonely and went somewhere else to live.\"    \"One could scarcely expect a young girl to live all alone in a forest,\"  added Woot. \"She would want company, of course, and so I believe she  has gone where other people live.\"    \"And perhaps she is still crying her poor little heart out because no  tin man comes to marry her,\" suggested Polychrome.    \"Well, in that case, it is the clear duty of you two tin persons to  seek Nimmie Amee until you find her,\" declared the Scarecrow.    \"I do not know where to look for the girl,\" said the Tin Soldier, \"for  I am almost a stranger to this part of the country.\"    \"I was born here,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"but the forest has few  inhabitants except the wild beasts. I cannot think of anyone living  near here with whom Nimmie Amee might care to live.\"    \"Why not go to Ku-Klip and ask him what has become of the girl?\"  proposed Polychrome.    That struck them all as being a good suggestion, so once more they  started to tramp through the forest, taking the direct path to  Ku-Klip's house, for both the tin twins knew the way, having followed  it many times.    Ku-Klip lived at the far edge of the great forest, his house facing the  broad plains of the Munchkin Country that lay to the eastward. But,  when they came to this residence by the forest's edge, the tinsmith was  not at home.    It was a pretty place, all painted dark blue with trimmings of lighter  blue. There was a neat blue fence around the yard and several blue  benches had been placed underneath the shady blue trees which marked  the line between forest and plain. There was a blue lawn before the  house, which was a good sized building. Ku-Klip lived in the front part  of the house and had his work-shop in the back part, where he had also  built a lean-to addition, in order to give him more room.    Although they found the tinsmith absent on their arrival, there was  smoke coming out of his chimney, which proved that he would soon return.    \"And perhaps Nimmie Amee will be with him,\" said the Scarecrow in a  cheerful voice.    While they waited, the Tin Woodman went to the door of the workshop  and, finding it unlocked, entered and looked curiously around the room  where he had been made.    \"It seems almost like home to me,\" hie told his friends, who had  followed him in. \"The first time I came here I had lost a leg, so I had  to carry it in my hand while I hopped on the other leg all the way from  the place in the forest where the enchanted axe cut me. I remember that  old Ku-Klip carefully put my meat leg into a barrel--I think that is  the same barrel, still standing in the corner yonder--and then at once  he began to make a tin leg for me. He worked fast and with skill, and I  was much interested in the job.\"    \"My experience was much the same,\" said the Tin Soldier. \"I used to  bring all the parts of me, which the enchanted sword had cut away, here  to the tinsmith, and Ku-Klip would put them into the barrel.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Woot, \"if those cast-off parts of you two unfortunates  are still in that barrel in the corner?\"    \"I suppose so.\" replied the Tin Woodman. \"In the Land of Oz no part of  a living creature can ever be destroyed.\"    \"If that is true, how was that Wicked Witch destroyed?\" inquired Woot.    \"Why, she was very old and was all dried up and withered before Oz  became a fairyland,\" explained the Scarecrow. \"Only her magic arts had  kept her alive so long, and when Dorothy's house fell upon her she just  turned to dust, and was blown away and scattered by the wind. I do not  think, however, that the parts cut away from these two young men could  ever be entirely destroyed and, if they are still in those barrels,  they are likely to be just the same as when the enchanted axe or sword  severed them.\"    \"It doesn't matter, however,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"our tin bodies are  more brilliant and durable, and quite satisfy us.\"    \"Yes, the tin bodies are best,\" agreed the Tin Soldier. \"Nothing can  hurt them.\"    \"Unless they get dented or rusted,\" said Woot, but both the tin men  frowned on him.    Scraps of tin, of all shapes and sizes, lay scattered around the  workshop. Also there were hammers and anvils and soldering irons and a  charcoal furnace and many other tools such as a tinsmith works with.  Against two of the side walls had been built stout work-benches and in  the center of the room was a long table. At the end of the shop, which  adjoined the dwelling, were several cupboards.    After examining the interior of the workshop until his curiosity was  satisfied, Woot said:    \"I think I will go outside until Ku-Klip comes. It does not seem quite  proper for us to take possession of his house while he is absent.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed the Scarecrow, and they were all about to leave  the room when the Tin Woodman said: \"Wait a minute,\" and they halted in  obedience to the command.          Chapter Eighteen    The Tin Woodman Talks to Himself      The Tin Woodman had just noticed the cupboards and was curious to know  what they contained, so he went to one of them and opened the door.  There were shelves inside, and upon one of the shelves which was about  on a level with his tin chin the Emperor discovered a Head--it looked  like a doll's head, only it was larger, and he soon saw it was the Head  of some person. It was facing the Tin Woodman and as the cupboard door  swung back, the eyes of the Head slowly opened and looked at him. The  Tin Woodman was not at all surprised, for in the Land of Oz one runs  into magic at every turn.    \"Dear me!\" said the Tin Woodman, staring hard. \"It seems as if I had  met you, somewhere, before. Good morning, sir!\"    \"You have the advantage of me,\" replied the Head. \"I never saw you  before in my life.\"    \"Still, your face is very familiar,\" persisted the Tin Woodman. \"Pardon  me, but may I ask if you--eh--eh--if you ever had a Body?\"    \"Yes, at one time,\" answered the Head, \"but that is so long ago I can't  remember it. Did you think,\" with a pleasant smile, \"that I was born  just as I am? That a Head would be created without a Body?\"    \"No, of course not,\" said the other. \"But how came you to lose your  body?\"    \"Well, I can't recollect the details; you'll have to ask Ku-Klip about  it,\" returned the Head. \"For, curious as it may seem to you, my memory  is not good since my separation from the rest of me. I still possess my  brains and my intellect is as good as ever, but my memory of some of  the events I formerly experienced is quite hazy.\"    \"How long have you been in this cupboard?\" asked the Emperor.    \"I don't know.\"    \"Haven't you a name?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said the Head; \"I used to be called Nick Chopper, when I was  a woodman and cut down trees for a living.\"    \"Good gracious!\" cried the Tin Woodman in astonishment. \"If you are  Nick Chopper's Head, then you are Me--or I'm You--or--or--What relation  are we, anyhow?\"    \"Don't ask me,\" replied the Head. \"For my part, I'm not anxious to  claim relationship with any common, manufactured article, like you. You  may be all right in your class, but your class isn't my class. You're  tin.\"    The poor Emperor felt so bewildered that for a time he could only stare  at his old Head in silence. Then he said:    \"I must admit that I wasn't at all bad looking before I became tin.  You're almost handsome--for meat. If your hair was combed, you'd be  quite attractive.\"    \"How do you expect me to comb my hair without help?\" demanded the Head,  indignantly. \"I used to keep it smooth and neat, when I had arms, but  after I was removed from the rest of me, my hair got mussed, and old  Ku-Klip never has combed it for me.\"    \"I'll speak to him about it,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"Do you remember  loving a pretty Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee?\"    \"No,\" answered the Head. \"That is a foolish question. The heart in my  body--when I had a body--might have loved someone, for all I know, but  a head isn't made to love; it's made to think.\"    \"Oh; do you think, then?\"    \"I used to think.\"    \"You must have been shut up in this cupboard for years and years. What  have you thought about, in all that time?\"    \"Nothing. That's another foolish question. A little reflection will  convince you that I have had nothing to think about, except the boards  on the inside of the cupboard door, and it didn't take me long to think  of everything about those boards that could be thought of. Then, of  course, I quit thinking.\"    \"And are you happy?\"    \"Happy? What's that?\"    \"Don't you know what happiness is?\" inquired the Tin Woodman.    \"I haven't the faintest idea whether it's round or square, or black or  white, or what it is. And, if you will pardon my lack of interest in  it, I will say that I don't care.\"    The Tin Woodman was much puzzled by these answers. His traveling  companions had grouped themselves at his back, and had fixed their eyes  on the Head and listened to the conversation with much interest, but  until now, they had not interrupted because they thought the Tin  Woodman had the best right to talk to his own head and renew  acquaintance with it.    But now the Tin Soldier remarked:    \"I wonder if my old head happens to be in any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#18)"],[1,"kettle?\"    \"Three fishes,\" he answered readily.    \"Where did you get them?\"    \"I caught them in the Lake of the Skeezers.\"    \"What do you intend to do with the fishes?\"    \"I shall carry them to the home of a friend of mine who has three  children. The children will love to have the fishes for pets.\"    She came over to the bench and looked into the kettle, where the three  fishes were swimming quietly in the water.    \"They're pretty,\" said Reera. \"Let me transform them into something  else.\"    \"No,\" objected the Skeezer.    \"I love to transform things; it's so interesting. And I've never  transformed any fishes in all my life.\"    \"Let them alone,\" said Ervic.    \"What shapes would you prefer them to have? I can make them turtles, or  cute little sea-horses; or I could make them piglets, or rabbits, or  guinea-pigs; or, if you like I can make chickens of them, or eagles, or  bluejays.\"    \"Let them alone!\" repeated Ervic.    \"You're not a very pleasant visitor,\" laughed Red Reera. \"People accuse  me of being cross and crabbed and unsociable, and they are quite right.  If you had come here pleading and begging for favors, and half afraid  of my Yookoohoo magic, I'd have abused you until you ran away; but  you're quite different from that. You're the unsociable and crabbed and  disagreeable one, and so I like you, and bear with your grumpiness.  It's time for my midday meal; are you hungry?\"    \"No,\" said Ervic, although he really desired food.    \"Well, I am,\" Reera declared and clapped her hands together. Instantly  a table appeared, spread with linen and bearing dishes of various  foods, some smoking hot. There were two plates laid, one at each end of  the table, and as soon as Reera seated herself all her creatures  gathered around her, as if they were accustomed to be fed when she ate.  The wolf squatted at her right hand and the kittens and chipmunks  gathered at her left.    \"Come, Stranger, sit down and eat,\" she called cheerfully, \"and while  we're eating let us decide into what forms we shall change your fishes.\"    \"They're all right as they are,\" asserted Ervic, drawing up his bench  to the table. \"The fishes are beauties--one gold, one silver and one  bronze. Nothing that has life is more lovely than a beautiful fish.\"    \"What! Am I not more lovely?\" Reera asked, smiling at his serious face.    \"I don't object to you--for a Yookoohoo, you know,\" he said, helping  himself to the food and eating with good appetite.    \"And don't you consider a beautiful girl more lovely than a fish,  however pretty the fish may be?\"    \"Well,\" replied Ervic, after a period of thought, \"that might be. If  you transformed my three fish into three girls--girls who would be  Adepts at Magic, you know they might please me as well as the fish do.  You won't do that of course, because you can't, with all your skill.  And, should you be able to do so, I fear my troubles would be more than  I could bear. They would not consent to be my slaves--especially if  they were Adepts at Magic--and so they would command me to obey them.  No, Mistress Reera, let us not transform the fishes at all.\"    The Skeezer had put his case with remarkable cleverness. He realized  that if he appeared anxious for such a transformation the Yookoohoo  would not perform it, yet he had skillfully suggested that they be made  Adepts at Magic.          Chapter Nineteen    Red Reera, the Yookoohoo      After the meal was over and Reera had fed her pets, including the four  monster spiders which had come down from their webs to secure their  share, she made the table disappear from the floor of the cottage.    \"I wish you'd consent to my transforming your fishes,\" she said, as she  took up her knitting again.    The Skeezer made no reply. He thought it unwise to hurry matters. All  during the afternoon they sat silent. Once Reera went to her cupboard  and after thrusting her hand into the same drawer as before, touched  the wolf and transformed it into a bird with gorgeous colored feathers.  This bird was larger than a parrot and of a somewhat different form,  but Ervic had never seen one like it before.    \"Sing!\" said Reera to the bird, which had perched itself on a big  wooden peg--as if it had been in the cottage before and knew just what  to do.    And the bird sang jolly, rollicking songs with words to them--just as a  person who had been carefully trained might do. The songs were  entertaining and Ervic enjoyed listening to them. In an hour or so the  bird stopped singing, tucked its head under its wing and went to sleep.  Reera continued knitting but seemed thoughtful.    Now Ervic had marked this cupboard drawer well and had concluded that  Reera took something from it which enabled her to perform her  transformations. He thought that if he managed to remain in the  cottage, and Reera fell asleep, he could slyly open the cupboard, take  a portion of whatever was in the drawer, and by dropping it into the  copper kettle transform the three fishes into their natural shapes.  Indeed, he had firmly resolved to carry out this plan when the  Yookoohoo put down her knitting and walked toward the door.    \"I'm going out for a few minutes,\" said she; \"do you wish to go with  me, or will you remain here?\"    Ervic did not answer but sat quietly on his bench. So Reera went out  and closed the cottage door.    As soon as she was gone, Ervic rose and tiptoed to the cupboard.    \"Take care! Take care!\" cried several voices, coming from the kittens  and chipmunks. \"If you touch anything we'll tell the Yookoohoo!\"    Ervic hesitated a moment but, remembering that he need not consider  Reera's anger if he succeeded in transforming the fishes, he was about  to open the cupboard when he was arrested by the voices of the fishes,  which stuck their heads above the water in the kettle and called out:    \"Come here, Ervic!\"    So he went back to the kettle and bent over it    \"Let the cupboard alone,\" said the goldfish to him earnestly. \"You  could not succeed by getting that magic powder, for only the Yookoohoo  knows how to use it. The best way is to allow her to transform us into  three girls, for then we will have our natural shapes and be able to  perform all the Arts of Magic we have learned and well understand. You  are acting wisely and in the most effective manner. We did not know you  were so intelligent, or that Reera could be so easily deceived by you.  Continue as you have begun and try to persuade her to transform us. But  insist that we be given the forms of girls.\"    The goldfish ducked its head down just as Reera re-entered the cottage.  She saw Ervic bent over the kettle, so she came and joined him.    \"Can your fishes talk?\" she asked.    \"Sometimes,\" he replied, \"for all fishes in the Land of Oz know how to  speak. Just now they were asking me for some bread. They are hungry.\"    \"Well, they can have some bread,\" said Reera. \"But it is nearly  supper-time, and if you would allow me to transform your fishes into  girls they could join us at the table and have plenty of food much  nicer than crumbs. Why not let me transform them?\"    \"Well,\" said Ervic, as if hesitating, \"ask the fishes. If they consent,  why--why, then, I'll think it over.\"    Reera bent over the kettle and asked:    \"Can you hear me, little fishes?\"    All three popped their heads above water.    \"We can hear you,\" said the bronzefish.    \"I want to give you other forms, such as rabbits, or turtles or girls,  or something; but your master, the surly Skeezer, does not wish me to.  However, he has agreed to the plan if you will consent.\"    \"We'd like to be girls,\" said the silverfish.    \"No, no!\" exclaimed Ervic.    \"If you promise to make us three beautiful girls, we will consent,\"  said the goldfish.    \"No, no!\" exclaimed Ervic again.    \"Also make us Adepts at Magic,\" added the bronzefish.    \"I don't know exactly what that means,\" replied Reera musingly, \"but as  no Adept at Magic is as powerful as Yookoohoo, I'll add that to the  transformation.\"    \"We won't try to harm you, or to interfere with your magic in any way,\"  promised the goldfish. \"On the contrary, we will be your friends.\"    \"Will you agree to go away and leave me alone in my cottage, whenever I  command you to do so?\" asked Reera.    \"We promise that,\" cried the three fishes.    \"Don't do it! Don't consent to the transformation,\" urged Ervic.    \"They have already consented,\" said the Yookoohoo, laughing in his  face, \"and you have promised me to abide by their decision. So, friend  Skeezer, I shall perform the transformation whether you like it or not.\"    Ervic seated himself on the bench again, a deep scowl on his face but  joy in his heart. Reera moved over to the cupboard, took something from  the drawer and returned to the copper kettle. She was clutching  something tightly in her right hand, but with her left she reached  within the kettle, took out the three fishes and laid them carefully on  the floor, where they gasped in distress at being out of water.    Reera did not keep them in misery more than a few seconds, for she  touched each one with her right hand and instantly the fishes were  transformed into three tall and slender young women, with fine,  intelligent faces and clothed in handsome, clinging gowns. The one who  had been a goldfish had beautiful golden hair and blue eyes and was  exceedingly fair of skin; the one who had been a bronzefish had dark  brown hair and clear gray eyes and her complexion matched these lovely  features. The one who had been a silverfish had snow-white hair of the  finest texture and deep brown eyes. The hair contrasted exquisitely  with her pink cheeks and ruby-red lips, nor did it make her look a day  older than her two companions.    As soon as they secured these girlish shapes, all three bowed low to  the Yookoohoo and said:    \"We thank you, Reera.\"    Then they bowed to the Skeezer and said:    \"We thank you, Ervic.\"    \"Very good!\" cried the"]]]
