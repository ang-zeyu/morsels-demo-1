The scattered boughs of the pines darkened the air as they whirled above  me; then came the blinding snow-storm: but I could behold the progress  of the tempest in safety, having gained the threshold of our house. The  driver of the oxen had thrown himself on the ground, while the poor  beasts held down their meek heads, patiently abiding \"the pelting of the  pitiless storm.\" S------, my husband, and the rest of the household,  collected in a group, watched with anxiety the wild havoc of the warring  elements. Not a leaf remained on the trees when the hurricane was over;  they were bare and desolate. Thus ended the short reign of the Indian  summer.    [Illustration: Newly-cleared Land]    I think the notion entertained by some travellers, that the Indian  summer is caused by the annual conflagration of forests by those Indians  inhabiting the unexplored regions beyond the larger lakes is absurd.  Imagine for an instant what immense tracts of woods must be yearly  consumed to affect nearly the whole of the continent of North America:  besides, it takes place at that season of the year when the fire is  least likely to run freely, owing to the humidity of the ground from the  autumnal rains. I should rather attribute the peculiar warmth and hazy  appearance of the air that marks this season, to the fermentation going  on of so great a mass of vegetable matter that is undergoing a state of  decomposition during the latter part of October and beginning of  November. It has been supposed by some persons that a great alteration  will be effected in this season, as the process of clearing the land  continues to decrease the quantity of decaying vegetation. Nay, I have  heard the difference is already observable by those long acquainted with  the American continent.    Hitherto my experience of the climate is favourable. The autumn has been  very fine, though the frosts are felt early in the month of September;  at first slightly, of a morning, but towards October more severely.  Still, though the first part of the day is cold, the middle of it is  warm and cheerful.    We already see the stern advances of winter. It commenced very decidedly  from the breaking up of the Indian summer. November is not at all like  the same month at home. The early part was soft and warm, the latter  cold, with keen frosts and occasional falls of snow; but it does not  seem to possess the dark, gloomy, damp character of our British  Novembers. However, it is not one season's acquaintance with the climate  that enables a person to form any correct judgment of its general  character, but a close observance of its peculiarities and vicissitudes  during many years' residence in the country.    I must now tell you what my husband is doing on our land. He has let out  ten acres to some Irish choppers who have established themselves in the  shanty for the winter. They are to receive fourteen dollars per acre for  chopping, burning, and fencing in that quantity. The ground is to be  perfectly cleared of every thing but the stumps: these will take from  seven to nine or ten years to decay; the pine, hemlock, and fir remain  much longer. The process of clearing away the stumps is too expensive  for new beginners to venture upon, labour being so high that it cannot  be appropriated to any but indispensable work. The working season is  very short on account of the length of time the frost remains on the  ground. With the exception of chopping trees, very little can be done.  Those that understand the proper management of uncleared land, usually  underbrush (that is, cut down all the small timbers and brushwood),  while the leaf is yet on them; this is piled in heaps, and the  windfallen trees are chopped through in lengths, to be logged up in the  spring with the winter's chopping. The latter end of the summer and the  autumn are the best seasons for this work. The leaves then become quite  dry and sear, and greatly assist in the important business of burning  off the heavy timbers. Another reason is, that when the snow has fallen  to some depth, the light timbers cannot be cut close to the ground, or  the dead branches and other incumbrances collected and thrown in heaps.    We shall have about three acres ready for spring-crops, provided we get  a good burning of that which is already chopped near the site of the  house,--this will be sown with oats, pumpkins, Indian corn, and  potatoes: the other ten acres will be ready for putting in a crop of  wheat. So you see it will be a long time before we reap a harvest. We  could not even get in spring-wheat early enough to come to perfection  this year.    We shall try to get two cows in the spring, as they are little expense  during the spring, summer, and autumn; and by the winter we shall have  pumpkins and oat-straw for them.          LETTER IX.

Lake House  April 18, 1833    BUT it is time that I should give you some account of our log-house,  into which we moved a few days before Christmas. Many unlooked-for  delays having hindered its completion before that time, I began to think  it would never be habitable.    The first misfortune that happened was the loss of a fine yoke of oxen  that were purchased to draw in the house-logs, that is, the logs for  raising the walls of the house. Not regarding the bush as pleasant as  their former master's cleared pastures, or perhaps foreseeing some hard  work to come, early one morning they took into their heads to ford the  lake at the head of the rapids, and march off, leaving no trace of their  route excepting their footing at the water's edge. After many days spent  in vain search for them, the work was at a stand, and for one month they  were gone, and we began to give up all expectation of hearing any news  of them. At last we learned they were some twenty miles off, in a  distant township, having made their way through bush and swamp, creek  and lake, back to their former owner, with an instinct that supplied to  them the want of roads and compass.    Oxen have been known to traverse a tract of wild country to a distance  of thirty or forty miles going in a direct line for their former haunts  by unknown paths, where memory could not avail them. In the dog we  consider it is scent as well as memory that guides him to his far-off  home;--but how is this conduct of the oxen to be accounted for? They  returned home through the mazes of interminable forests, where man, with  all his reason and knowledge, would have been bewildered and lost.    It was the latter end of October before even the walls of our house were  up. To effect this we called \"a bee.\" Sixteen of our neighbours  cheerfully obeyed our summons; and though the day was far from  favourable, so faithfully did our hive perform their tasks, that by  night the outer walls were raised.    The work went merrily on with the help of plenty of Canadian nectar  (whiskey), the honey that our _bees_ are solaced with. Some huge joints  of salt pork, a peck of potatoes, with a rice-pudding, and a loaf as big  as an enormous Cheshire cheese, formed the feast that was to regale them  during the raising. This was spread out in the shanty, in a _very rural  style_. In short, we laughed, and called it a _pic-nic in the  backwoods_; and rude as was the fare, I can assure you, great was the  satisfaction expressed by all the guests of every degree, our \"_bee_\"  being considered as very well conducted. In spite of the difference of  rank among those that assisted at the bee, the greatest possible harmony  prevailed, and the party separated well pleased with the day's work and  entertainment.    The following day I went to survey the newly-raised edifice, but was  sorely puzzled, as it presented very little appearance of a house. It  was merely an oblong square of logs raised one above the other, with  open spaces between every row of logs. The spaces for the doors and  windows were not then chopped out, and the rafters were not up. In  short, it looked a very queer sort of a place, and I returned home a  little disappointed, and wondering that my husband should be so well  pleased with the progress that had been made. A day or two after this I  again visited it. The _sleepers_ were laid to support the floors, and  the places for the doors and windows cut out of the solid timbers, so  that it had not quite so much the look of a bird-cage as before.    After the roof was shingled, we were again at a stand, as no boards  could be procured nearer than Peterborough, a long day's journey through  horrible roads. At that time no saw-mill was in progress; now there is a  fine one building within a little distance of us. Our flooring-boards  were all to be sawn by hand, and it was some time before any one could  be found to perform this necessary work, and that at high wages--six-  and-sixpence per day. Well, the boards were at length down, but of  course of unseasoned timber: this was unavoidable; so as they could not  be planed we were obliged to put up with their rough unsightly  appearance, for no better were to be had. I began to recall to mind the  observation of the old gentleman with whom we travelled from Cobourg to  Rice Lake. We console ourselves with the prospect that by next summer  the boards will all be seasoned, and then the house is to be turned  topsy-turvy, by having the floors all relaid, jointed, and smoothed.    The next misfortune that happened, was, that the mixture of clay and  lime that was to plaster the inside and outside of the house"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#19)"],[1,"scientifiques, la division ne semble pas possible, le fouilleur devra  recevoir, au lieu d'une partie de la trouvaille, une juste indemnite.
