[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#18)"],[1," of great beauty, Draper  having made some attempts at an even earlier date. But astronomical  photography really owes its beginning to De la Rue, who used the  collodion process for the moon in 1853, and constructed the Kew  photoheliograph in 1857, from which date these instruments have been  multiplied, and have given us an accurate record of the sun's surface.  Gelatine dry plates were first used by Huggins in 1876.    It is noteworthy that from the outset De la Rue recognised the value  of stereoscopic vision, which is now known to be of supreme  accuracy. In 1853 he combined pairs of photographs of the moon in the  same phase, but under different conditions regarding libration,  showing the moon from slightly different points of view.  These in the  stereoscope exhibited all the relief resulting from binocular vision,  and looked like a solid globe.  In 1860 he used successive photographs  of the total solar eclipse stereoscopically, to prove that the red  prominences belong to the sun, and not to the moon.  In 1861 he  similarly combined two photographs of a sun-spot, the perspective  effect showing the umbra like a floor at the bottom of a hollow  penumbra; and in one case the faculae were discovered to be sailing  over a spot apparently at some considerable height.  These appearances  may be partly due to a proper motion; but, so far as it went, this was  a beautiful confirmation of Wilson's discovery. Hewlett, however, in  1894, after thirty years of work, showed that the spots are not always  depressions, being very subject to disturbance.    The Kew photographs [7] contributed a vast amount of information about  sun-spots, and they showed that the faculae generally follow the spots  in their rotation round the sun.    The constitution of the sun's photosphere, the layer which is the  principal light-source on the sun, has always been a subject of great  interest; and much was done by men with exceptionally keen eyesight,  like Mr. Dawes. But it was a difficult subject, owing to the rapidity  of the changes in appearance of the so-called rice-grains, about 1\" in  diameter. The rapid transformations and circulations of these  rice-grains, if thoroughly studied, might lead to a much better  knowledge of solar physics. This seemed almost hopeless, as it was  found impossible to identify any \"rice-grain\" in the turmoil after a  few minutes. But M.  Hansky, of Pulkowa (whose recent death is  deplored), introduced successfully a scheme of photography, which  might almost be called a solar cinematograph. He took photographs of  the sun at intervals of fifteen or thirty seconds, and then enlarged  selected portions of these two hundred times, giving a picture  corresponding to a solar disc of six metres diameter. In these  enlarged pictures he was able to trace the movements, and changes of  shape and brightness, of individual rice-grains. Some granules become  larger or smaller. Some seem to rise out of a mist, as it were, and to  become clearer.  Others grow feebler. Some are split in two. Some are  rotated through a right angle in a minute or less, although each of  the grains may be the size of Great Britain. Generally they move  together in groups of very various velocities, up to forty kilometres  a second.  These movements seem to have definite relation to any  sun-spots in the neighbourhood. From the results already obtained it  seems certain that, if this method of observation be continued, it  cannot fail to supply facts of the greatest importance.    It is quite impossible to do justice here to the work of all those who  are engaged on astronomical physics.  The utmost that can be attempted  is to give a fair idea of the directions of human thought and  endeavour.  During the last half-century America has made splendid  progress, and an entirely new process of studying the photosphere has  been independently perfected by Professor Hale at Chicago, and  Deslandres at Paris.[8] They have succeeded in photographing the sun's  surface in monochromatic light, such as the light given off as one of  the bright lines of hydrogen or of calcium, by means of the  \"Spectroheliograph.\" The spectroscope is placed with its slit in the  focus of an equatoreal telescope, pointed to the sun, so that the  circular image of the sun falls on the slit. At the other end of the  spectroscope is the photographic plate. Just in front of this plate  there is another slit parallel to the first, in the position where the  image of the first slit formed by the K line of calcium falls. Thus is  obtained a photograph of the section of the sun, made by the first  slit, only in K light. As the image of the sun passes over the first  slit the photographic plate is moved at the same rate and in the same  direction behind the second slit; and as successive sections of the  sun's image in the equatoreal enter the apparatus, so are these  sections successively thrown in their proper place on the photographic  plate, always in K light. By using a high dispersion the faculae which  give off K light can be correctly photographed, not only at the sun's  edge, but all over his surface. The actual mechanical method of  carrying out the observation is not quite so simple as what is here  described.    By choosing another line of the spectrum instead of calcium K--for  example, the hydrogen line H(3)--we obtain two photographs, one  showing the appearance of the calcium floculi, and the other of the  hydrogen floculi, on the same part of the solar surface; and nothing  is more astonishing than to note the total want of resemblance in the  forms shown on the two. This mode of research promises to afford many  new and useful data.    The spectroscope has revealed the fact that, broadly speaking, the sun  is composed of the same materials as the earth. Angstrom was the first  to map out all of the lines to be found in the solar spectrum. But  Rowland, of Baltimore, after having perfected the art of making true  gratings with equidistant lines ruled on metal for producing spectra,  then proceeded to make a map of the solar spectrum on a large scale.    In 1866 Lockyer[9] threw an image of the sun upon the slit of a  spectroscope, and was thus enabled to compare the spectrum of a spot  with that of the general solar surface. The observation proved the  darkness of a spot to be caused by increased absorption of light, not  only in the dark lines, which are widened, but over the entire  spectrum. In 1883 Young resolved this continuous obscurity into an  infinite number of fine lines, which have all been traced in a shadowy  way on to the general solar surface. Lockyer also detected  displacements of the spectrum lines in the spots, such as would be  produced by a rapid motion in the line of sight. It has been found  that both uprushes and downrushes occur, but there is no marked  predominance of either in a sun-spot. The velocity of motion thus  indicated in the line of sight sometimes appears to amount to 320  miles a second. But it must be remembered that pressure of a gas has  some effect in displacing the spectral lines.  So we must go on,  collecting data, until a time comes when the meaning of all the facts  can be made clear.    _Total Solar Eclipses_.--During total solar eclipses the time is so  short, and the circumstances so impressive, that drawings of the  appearance could not always be trusted. The red prominences of jagged  form that are seen round the moon's edge, and the corona with its  streamers radiating or interlacing, have much detail that can hardly  be recorded in a sketch. By the aid of photography a number of records  can be taken during the progress of totality. From a study of these  the extent of the corona is demonstrated in one case to extend to at  least six diameters of the moon, though the eye has traced it  farther. This corona is still one of the wonders of astronomy, and  leads to many questions. What is its consistency, if it extends many  million miles from the sun's surface? How is it that it opposed no  resistance to the motion of comets which have almost grazed the sun's  surface? Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?  The character of  the corona in photographic records has been shown to depend upon the  phase of the sun-spot period. During the sun-spot maximum the corona  seems most developed over the spot-zones--i.e., neither at the  equator nor the poles. The four great sheaves of light give it a  square appearance, and are made up of rays or plumes, delicate like  the petals of a flower.  During a minimum the nebulous ring seems to  be made of tufts of fine hairs with aigrettes or radiations from both  poles, and streamers from the equator.    [Illustration: SOLAR ECLIPSE, 1882.  From drawing by W. H. Wesley,  Secretary R.A.S.; showing the prominences, the corona, and an unknown  comet.]      On September 19th, 1868, eclipse spectroscopy began with the Indian  eclipse, in which all observers found that the red prominences showed  a bright line spectrum, indicating the presence of hydrogen and other  gases.  So bright was it that Jansen exclaimed: \"_Je verrai ces  lignes-la en dehors des eclipses_.\" And the next day he observed the  lines at the edge of the uneclipsed sun.  Huggins had suggested this  observation in February, 1868, his idea being to use prisms of such  great dispersive power that the continuous spectrum reflected by our  atmosphere should be greatly weakened, while a bright line would  suffer no diminution by the high dispersion.  On October 20th  Lockyer,[10] having news of the eclipse, but not of Jansen's  observations the day after, was able to see these lines. This was a  splendid performance, for it enabled the prominences to be observed,  not only during eclipses, but every day. Moreover, the next year  Huggins was able, by using a wide slit, to see the whole of a  prominence and note its shape.  Prominences are classified, according  to their form, into \"flame\" and \"cloud\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8177"],[0,"The Esperanto Teacher: A Simple Course for Non-Grammarians (#18)"],[1,"                                 3.
