[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#18)"],[1,"his senses he will kill me,\" she said, in Arabic.    Korak could not understand her.  He shook his head, speaking to her  first in English and then in the language of the great apes; but  neither of these was intelligible to her.  She leaned forward and  touched the hilt of the long knife that the Arab wore.  Then she raised  her clasped hand above her head and drove an imaginary blade into her  breast above her heart.  Korak understood.  The old man would kill her.  The girl came to his side again and stood there trembling.  She did not  fear him.  Why should she?  He had saved her from a terrible beating at  the hands of The Sheik.  Never, in her memory, had another so  befriended her.  She looked up into his face.  It was a boyish,  handsome face, nut-brown like her own.  She admired the spotted leopard  skin that circled his lithe body from one shoulder to his knees.  The  metal anklets and armlets adorning him aroused her envy.  Always had  she coveted something of the kind; but never had The Sheik permitted  her more than the single cotton garment that barely sufficed to cover  her nakedness.  No furs or silks or jewelry had there ever been for  little Meriem.    And Korak looked at the girl.  He had always held girls in a species of  contempt.  Boys who associated with them were, in his estimation,  mollycoddles.  He wondered what he should do.  Could he leave her here  to be abused, possibly murdered, by the villainous old Arab?  No!  But,  on the other hand, could he take her into the jungle with him?  What  could he accomplish burdened by a weak and frightened girl?  She would  scream at her own shadow when the moon came out upon the jungle night  and the great beasts roamed, moaning and roaring, through the darkness.    He stood for several minutes buried in thought.  The girl watched his  face, wondering what was passing in his mind.  She, too, was thinking  of the future.  She feared to remain and suffer the vengeance of The  Sheik.  There was no one in all the world to whom she might turn, other  than this half-naked stranger who had dropped miraculously from the  clouds to save her from one of The Sheik's accustomed beatings.  Would  her new friend leave her now?  Wistfully she gazed at his intent face.  She moved a little closer to him, laying a slim, brown hand upon his  arm.  The contact awakened the lad from his absorption.  He looked down  at her, and then his arm went about her shoulder once more, for he saw  tears upon her lashes.    \"Come,\" he said.  \"The jungle is kinder than man.  You shall live in  the jungle and Korak and Akut will protect you.\"    She did not understand his words, but the pressure of his arm drawing  her away from the prostrate Arab and the tents was quite intelligible.  One little arm crept about his waist and together they walked toward  the palisade.  Beneath the great tree that had harbored Korak while he  watched the girl at play he lifted her in his arms and throwing her  lightly across his shoulder leaped nimbly into the lower branches.  Her  arms were about his neck and from one little hand Geeka dangled down  his straight young back.    And so Meriem entered the jungle with Korak, trusting, in her childish  innocence, the stranger who had befriended her, and perhaps influenced  in her belief in him by that strange intuitive power possessed by  woman.  She had no conception of what the future might hold.  She did  not know, nor could she have guessed the manner of life led by her  protector.  Possibly she pictured a distant village similar to that of  The Sheik in which lived other white men like the stranger.  That she  was to be taken into the savage, primeval life of a jungle beast could  not have occurred to her.  Had it, her little heart would have  palpitated with fear.  Often had she wished to run away from the  cruelties of The Sheik and Mabunu; but the dangers of the jungle always  had deterred her.    The two had gone but a short distance from the village when the girl  spied the huge proportions of the great Akut.  With a half-stifled  scream she clung more closely to Korak, and pointed fearfully toward  the ape.    Akut, thinking that The Killer was returning with a prisoner, came  growling toward them--a little girl aroused no more sympathy in the  beast's heart than would a full-grown bull ape.  She was a stranger and  therefore to be killed.  He bared his yellow fangs as he approached,  and to his surprise The Killer bared his likewise, but he bared them at  Akut, and snarled menacingly.    \"Ah,\" thought Akut, \"The Killer has taken a mate,\" and so, obedient to  the tribal laws of his kind, he left them alone, becoming suddenly  absorbed in a fuzzy caterpillar of peculiarly succulent appearance.  The larva disposed of, he glanced from the corner of an eye at Korak.  The youth had deposited his burden upon a large limb, where she clung  desperately to keep from falling.    \"She will accompany us,\" said Korak to Akut, jerking a thumb in the  direction of the girl.  \"Do not harm her.  We will protect her.\"    Akut shrugged.  To be burdened by the young of man was in no way to his  liking.  He could see from her evident fright at her position on the  branch, and from the terrified glances she cast in his direction that  she was hopelessly unfit.  By all the ethics of Akut's training and  inheritance the unfit should be eliminated; but if The Killer wished  this there was nothing to be done about it but to tolerate her.  Akut  certainly didn't want her--of that he was quite positive.  Her skin was  too smooth and hairless.  Quite snake-like, in fact, and her face was  most unattractive.  Not at all like that of a certain lovely she he had  particularly noticed among the apes in the amphitheater the previous  night.  Ah, there was true feminine beauty for one!--a great, generous  mouth; lovely, yellow fangs, and the cutest, softest side whiskers!  Akut sighed.  Then he rose, expanded his great chest and strutted back  and forth along a substantial branch, for even a puny thing like this  she of Korak's might admire his fine coat and his graceful carriage.    But poor little Meriem only shrank closer to Korak and almost wished  that she were back in the village of The Sheik where the terrors of  existence were of human origin, and so more or less familiar.  The  hideous ape frightened her.  He was so large and so ferocious in  appearance.  His actions she could only interpret as a menace, for how  could she guess that he was parading to excite admiration?  Nor could  she know of the bond of fellowship which existed between this great  brute and the godlike youth who had rescued her from the Sheik.    Meriem spent an evening and a night of unmitigated terror.  Korak and  Akut led her along dizzy ways as they searched for food.  Once they hid  her in the branches of a tree while they stalked a near-by buck.  Even  her natural terror of being left alone in the awful jungle was  submerged in a greater horror as she saw the man and the beast spring  simultaneously upon their prey and drag it down, as she saw the  handsome face of her preserver contorted in a bestial snarl; as she saw  his strong, white teeth buried in the soft flesh of the kill.    When he came back to her blood smeared his face and hands and breast  and she shrank from him as he offered her a huge hunk of hot, raw meat.  He was evidently much disturbed by her refusal to eat, and when, a  moment later, he scampered away into the forest to return with fruit  for her she was once more forced to alter her estimation of him.  This  time she did not shrink, but acknowledged his gift with a smile that,  had she known it, was more than ample payment to the affection starved  boy.    The sleeping problem vexed Korak.  He knew that the girl could not  balance herself in safety in a tree crotch while she slept, nor would  it be safe to permit her to sleep upon the ground open to the attacks  of prowling beasts of prey.  There was but a single solution that  presented itself--he must hold her in his arms all night.  And that he  did, with Akut braced upon one side of her and he upon the other, so  that she was warmed by the bodies of them both.    She did not sleep much until the night was half spent; but at last  Nature overcame her terrors of the black abyss beneath and the hairy  body of the wild beast at her side, and she fell into a deep slumber  which outlasted the darkness.  When she opened her eyes the sun was  well up.  At first she could not believe in the reality of her  position.  Her head had rolled from Korak's shoulder so that her eyes  were directed upon the hairy back of the ape.  At sight of it she  shrank away.  Then she realized that someone was holding her, and  turning her head she saw the smiling eyes of the youth regarding her.  When he smiled she could not fear him, and now she shrank closer  against him in natural revulsion toward the rough coat of the brute  upon her other side.    Korak spoke to her in the language of the apes; but she shook her head,  and spoke to him in the language of the Arab, which was as  unintelligible to him as was ape speech to her.  Akut sat up and looked  at them.  He could understand what Korak said but the girl made only  foolish noises that were entirely unintelligible and ridiculous.  Akut  could not understand what Korak saw in her to attract him.  He looked  at her long and steadily, appraising her carefully, then he scratched  his head, rose and shook himself.    His movement gave the girl a little start--she had forgotten Akut for  the moment.  Again she shrank from him.  The beast saw that she feared  him, and being a brute enjoyed the evidence of the terror his  brutishness inspired.  Crouching, he extended his huge hand stealthily  toward her, as though to seize her.  She shrank still further away.  Akut's eyes were busy drinking in the humor of the situation--he did  not see the narrowing eyes of the boy upon him, nor the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#18)"],[1,"\"But I  pray you, since you seem to know him, to point out to me the shortest  path to my brother's house.\"    The serf was about to reply, when the clear ringing call of a bugle  burst from the wood close behind them, and Alleyne caught sight for  an instant of the dun side and white breast of a lordly stag glancing  swiftly betwixt the distant tree trunks. A minute later came the shaggy  deer-hounds, a dozen or fourteen of them, running on a hot scent, with  nose to earth and tail in air. As they streamed past the silent forest  around broke suddenly into loud life, with galloping of hoofs, crackling  of brushwood, and the short, sharp cries of the hunters. Close behind  the pack rode a fourrier and a yeoman-pricker, whooping on the laggards  and encouraging the leaders, in the shrill half-French jargon which was  the language of venery and woodcraft. Alleyne was still gazing  after them, listening to the loud \"Hyke-a-Bayard! Hyke-a-Pomers!  Hyke-a-Lebryt!\" with which they called upon their favorite hounds, when  a group of horsemen crashed out through the underwood at the very spot  where the serf and he were standing.    The one who led was a man between fifty and sixty years of age, war-worn  and weather-beaten, with a broad, thoughtful forehead and eyes which  shone brightly from under his fierce and overhung brows. His beard,  streaked thickly with gray, bristled forward from his chin, and spoke  of a passionate nature, while the long, finely cut face and firm mouth  marked the leader of men. His figure was erect and soldierly, and he  rode his horse with the careless grace of a man whose life had been  spent in the saddle. In common garb, his masterful face and flashing  eye would have marked him as one who was born to rule; but now, with his  silken tunic powdered with golden fleurs-de-lis, his velvet mantle lined  with the royal minever, and the lions of England stamped in silver upon  his harness, none could fail to recognize the noble Edward, most warlike  and powerful of all the long line of fighting monarchs who had ruled  the Anglo-Norman race. Alleyne doffed hat and bowed head at the sight  of him, but the serf folded his hands and leaned them upon his cudgel,  looking with little love at the knot of nobles and knights-in-waiting  who rode behind the king.    \"Ha!\" cried Edward, reining up for an instant his powerful black steed.  \"Le cerf est passe? Non? Ici, Brocas; tu parles Anglais.\"    \"The deer, clowns?\" said a hard-visaged, swarthy-faced man, who rode at  the king's elbow. \"If ye have headed it back it is as much as your ears  are worth.\"    \"It passed by the blighted beech there,\" said Alleyne, pointing, \"and  the hounds were hard at its heels.\"    \"It is well,\" cried Edward, still speaking in French: for, though he  could understand English, he had never learned to express himself in so  barbarous and unpolished a tongue. \"By my faith, sirs,\" he continued,  half turning in his saddle to address his escort, \"unless my woodcraft  is sadly at fault, it is a stag of six tines and the finest that we have  roused this journey. A golden St. Hubert to the man who is the first to  sound the mort.\" He shook his bridle as he spoke, and thundered away,  his knights lying low upon their horses and galloping as hard as whip  and spur would drive them, in the hope of winning the king's prize. Away  they drove down the long green glade--bay horses, black and gray, riders  clad in every shade of velvet, fur, or silk, with glint of brazen horn  and flash of knife and spear. One only lingered, the black-browed Baron  Brocas, who, making a gambade which brought him within arm-sweep of  the serf, slashed him across the face with his riding-whip. \"Doff, dog,  doff,\" he hissed, \"when a monarch deigns to lower his eyes to such as  you!\"--then spurred through the underwood and was gone, with a gleam of  steel shoes and flutter of dead leaves.    The villein took the cruel blow without wince or cry, as one to whom  stripes are a birthright and an inheritance. His eyes flashed, however,  and he shook his bony hand with a fierce wild gesture after the  retreating figure.    \"Black hound of Gascony,\" he muttered, \"evil the day that you and those  like you set foot in free England! I know thy kennel of Rochecourt. The  night will come when I may do to thee and thine what you and your class  have wrought upon mine and me. May God smite me if I fail to smite thee,  thou French robber, with thy wife and thy child and all that is under  thy castle roof!\"    \"Forbear!\" cried Alleyne. \"Mix not God's name with these unhallowed  threats! And yet it was a coward's blow, and one to stir the blood and  loose the tongue of the most peaceful. Let me find some soothing simples  and lay them on the weal to draw the sting.\"    \"Nay, there is but one thing that can draw the sting, and that the  future may bring to me. But, clerk, if you would see your brother you  must on, for there is a meeting to-day, and his merry men will await him  ere the shadows turn from west to east. I pray you not to hold him back,  for it would be an evil thing if all the stout lads were there and the  leader a-missing. I would come with you, but sooth to say I am stationed  here and may not move. The path over yonder, betwixt the oak and the  thorn, should bring you out into his nether field.\"    Alleyne lost no time in following the directions of the wild, masterless  man, whom he left among the trees where he had found him. His heart was  the heavier for the encounter, not only because all bitterness and wrath  were abhorrent to his gentle nature, but also because it disturbed him  to hear his brother spoken of as though he were a chief of outlaws or  the leader of a party against the state. Indeed, of all the things which  he had seen yet in the world to surprise him there was none more  strange than the hate which class appeared to bear to class. The talk  of laborer, woodman and villein in the inn had all pointed to the  wide-spread mutiny, and now his brother's name was spoken as though he  were the very centre of the universal discontent. In good truth, the  commons throughout the length and breadth of the land were heart-weary  of this fine game of chivalry which had been played so long at their  expense. So long as knight and baron were a strength and a guard to the  kingdom they might be endured, but now, when all men knew that the great  battles in France had been won by English yeomen and Welsh stabbers,  warlike fame, the only fame to which his class had ever aspired,  appeared to have deserted the plate-clad horsemen. The sports of the  lists had done much in days gone by to impress the minds of the people,  but the plumed and unwieldy champion was no longer an object either of  fear or of reverence to men whose fathers and brothers had shot into the  press at Crecy or Poitiers, and seen the proudest chivalry in the world  unable to make head against the weapons of disciplined peasants. Power  had changed hands. The protector had become the protected, and the whole  fabric of the feudal system was tottering to a fall. Hence the fierce  mutterings of the lower classes and the constant discontent, breaking  out into local tumult and outrage, and culminating some years later in  the great rising of Tyler. What Alleyne saw and wondered at in Hampshire  would have appealed equally to the traveller in any other English county  from the Channel to the marches of Scotland.    He was following the track, his misgivings increasing with every step  which took him nearer to that home which he had never seen, when of a  sudden the trees began to thin and the sward to spread out onto a broad,  green lawn, where five cows lay in the sunshine and droves of black  swine wandered unchecked. A brown forest stream swirled down the centre  of this clearing, with a rude bridge flung across it, and on the other  side was a second field sloping up to a long, low-lying wooden house,  with thatched roof and open squares for windows. Alleyne gazed across  at it with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes--for this, he knew, must  be the home of his fathers. A wreath of blue smoke floated up through a  hole in the thatch, and was the only sign of life in the place, save a  great black hound which lay sleeping chained to the door-post. In the  yellow shimmer of the autumn sunshine it lay as peacefully and as still  as he had oft pictured it to himself in his dreams.    He was roused, however, from his pleasant reverie by the sound of  voices, and two people emerged from the forest some little way to his  right and moved across the field in the direction of the bridge. The one  was a man with yellow flowing beard and very long hair of the same tint  drooping over his shoulders; his dress of good Norwich cloth and his  assured bearing marked him as a man of position, while the sombre hue  of his clothes and the absence of all ornament contrasted with the flash  and glitter which had marked the king's retinue. By his side walked  a woman, tall and slight and dark, with lithe, graceful figure and  clear-cut, composed features. Her jet-black hair was gathered back under  a light pink coif, her head poised proudly upon her neck, and her step  long and springy, like that of some wild, tireless woodland creature.  She held her left hand in front of her, covered with a red velvet glove,  and on the wrist a little brown falcon, very fluffy and bedraggled,  which she smoothed and fondled as she walked. As she came out into the  sunshine, Alleyne noticed that her light gown, slashed with pink, was  all stained with earth and with moss upon one side from shoulder to hem.  He stood in the shadow of an oak staring at her with parted lips, for  this woman seemed to him to be the most beautiful and graceful creature  that mind could conceive of. Such had he imagined the angels, and such  he had tried to paint them in the Beaulieu missals; but here there was  something human, were it only "]]]
