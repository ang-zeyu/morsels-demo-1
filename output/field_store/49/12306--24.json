[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#18)"],[1,"land, \"not for an hour!\"  Milton is indignant that these indulgences, which had been refused to  their obedience, should have been extorted by their rebellion, and  the massacre of \"200,000 Protestants\". This is an exaggeration of a  butchery sufficiently tragic in its real proportions, and in a later  tract (_Eikonoklastes_) he reduces it to 154,000. Though the  savage Irish are barbarians, uncivilised and uncivilisable, the  _Observations_ distinctly affirm the new principle of toleration.  Though popery be a superstition, the death of all true religion, still  conscience is not within the cognisance of the magistrate. The civil  sword is to be employed against civil offences only. In adding that  the one exception to this toleration is atheism, Milton is careful to  state this limitation as being the toleration professed by Parliament,  and not as his private opinion.    So well satisfied were the Council with their secretary's  _Observations_ on the peace of Kilkenny, that they next imposed upon  him a far more important labour, a reply to the _Eikon Basiliké_. The  execution of Charles I. was not an act of vengeance, but a measure of  public safety. If, as Hallam affirms, there mingled in the motives of  the managers any strain of personal ill-will, this was merged in the  necessity of securing, themselves from the vengeance of the King, and  what they had gained from being taken back. They were alarmed by  the reaction which had set in, and had no choice but to strengthen  themselves by a daring policy. But the first effect of the removal of  the King by violence was to give a powerful stimulus to the reaction  already in progress. The groan, which burst from the spectators before  Whitehall on January 30, 1649, was only representative of the thrill  of horror which ran through England and Scotland in the next ten days.  This feeling found expression in a book entitled \"_Eikon Basiliké_,  the portraiture of his sacred majesty in his solitude and sufferings.\"  The book was, it should seem, composed by Dr. Gauden, but professed  to be an authentic copy of papers written by the King. It is possible  that Gauden may have had in his hands some written scraps of the  King's meditations. If he had such, he only used them as hints to work  upon. Gauden was a churchman whom his friends might call liberal,  and his enemies time-serving. He was a churchman of the stamp of  Archbishop Williams, and preferred bishops and the Common-prayer to  presbyters and extempore sermons, but did not think the difference  between the two of the essence of religion. In better times Gauden  would have passed for broad, though his latitudinarianism was more the  result of love of ease than of philosophy. Though a royalist he sat in  the Westminster Assembly, and took the covenant, for which compliance  he nearly lost the reward which, after the Restoration, became his  due. Like the university-bred men of his day, Gauden was not a man of  ideas, but of style. In the present instance the idea was supplied  by events. The saint and martyr, the man of sorrows, praying for  his murderers, the King, who renounced an earthly kingdom to gain  a heavenly, and who in return for his benefits received from an  unthankful people a crown of thorns--this was the theme supplied to  the royalist advocate. Poet's imagination had never invented one more  calculated to touch the popular heart. This _imitatio Christi_ to  which every private Christian theoretically aspires, had been realised  by a true prince upon an actual scaffold with a graceful dignity of  demeanour, of which it may be said, that nothing in life became him  like the leaving it.    This moving situation Gauden, no mean stylist, set out in the best  academical language of the period. Frigid and artificial it may read  now, but the passion and pity, which is not in the book, was supplied  by the readers of the time. And men are not dainty as to phrase when  they meet with an expression of their own sentiments. The readers of  _Eikon Basilike_--and forty-seven editions were necessary to supply  the demand of a population of eight millions--attributed to the pages  of the book emotions raised in themselves by the tragic catastrophe.  They never doubted that the meditations were those of the royal  martyr, and held the book, in the words of Sir Edward Nicholas, for  \"the most exquisite, pious, and princely piece ever written.\" The  Parliament thought themselves called upon to put forth a reply. If one  book could cause such a commotion of spirits, another book could allay  it--the ordinary illusion of those who do not consider that the vogue  of a printed appeal depends, not on the contents of the appeal, but on  a predisposition of the public temper.    Selden, the most learned man, not only of his party, but of  Englishmen, was first thought of, but the task was finally assigned  to the Latin Secretary. Milton's ready pen completed the answer,  _Eikonoklastes_, a quarto of 242 pages, before October, 1649. It  is, like all answers, worthless as a book. Eikonoklastes, the  Image-breaker, takes the Image, Eikon, paragraph by paragraph, turning  it round, and asserting the negative. To the Royalist view of the  points in dispute Milton opposes the Independent view. A refutation,  which follows each step of an adverse book, is necessarily devoid of  originality. But Milton is worse than tedious; his reply is in a tone  of rude railing and insolent swagger, which would have been always  unbecoming, but which at this moment was grossly indecent.    Milton must, however, be acquitted of one charge which has been made  against him, viz., that he taunts the king with his familiarity with  Shakespeare. The charge rests on a misunderstanding. In quoting  Richard III. in illustration of his own meaning, Milton, says, \"I  shall not instance an abstruse author, wherein the King might be less  conversant, but one whom we well know was the closet companion of  these his solitudes, William Shakespeare.\" Though not an overt gibe,  there certainly lurks an insinuation to Milton's Puritan readers, to  whom stage plays were an abomination--an unworthy device of rhetoric,  as appealing to a superstition in others which the writer himself does  not share. In Milton's contemptuous reference to Sidney's _Arcadia_ as  a vain amatorious poem, we feel that the finer sense of the author of  _L'Allegro_ has suffered from immersion in the slough of religious and  political faction.    Gauden, raking up material from all quarters, had inserted in his  compilation a prayer taken from the _Arcadia_. Milton mercilessly  works this topic against his adversary. It is surprising that this  plagiarism from so well-known a book as the _Arcadia_ should not have  opened Milton's eyes to the unauthentic character of the _Eikon_. He  alludes, indeed, to a suspicion which was abroad that one of the royal  chaplains was a secret coadjutor. But he knew nothing of Gauden at the  time of writing the _Eikonoklastes_, and probably he never came to  know anything. The secret of the authorship of the _Eikon_ was well  kept, being known only to a very few persons--the two royal brothers,  Bishop Morley, the Earl of Bristol, and Clarendon. These were all safe  men, and Gauden was not likely to proclaim himself an impostor. He  pleaded his authorship, however, as a claim to preferment at the  Restoration, when the church spoils came to be partitioned among  the conquerors, and he received the bishopric of Exeter. A  bishopric--because less than the highest preferment could not  be offered to one whose pen had done such signal service; and  Exeter--because the poorest see (then valued at 500 l. a year) was good  enough for a man who had taken the covenant and complied with the  usurping government. By ceaseless importunity the author of the _Eikon  Basilike_ obtained afterwards the see of Worcester, while the portion  of the author of _Eikonoklastes_ was poverty, infamy, and calumny. A  century after Milton's death it was safe for the most popular writer  of the day to say that the prayer from the _Arcadia_ had been  interpolated in the _Eikon_ by Milton himself, and then by him charged  upon the King as a plagiarism (Johnson, _Lives of the Poets_.)          CHAPTER IX.    MILTON AND SALMASIUS.--BLINDNESS.      The mystery which long surrounded the authorship of _Eikon Basilike_  lends a literary interest to Milton's share in that controversy,  which does not belong to his next appearance in print. Besides, his  pamphlets against Salmasius and Morus are written in Latin, and to  the general reader in this country and in America inaccessible in  consequence. In Milton's day it was otherwise; the widest circle of  readers could only be reached through Latin. For this reason, when  Charles II. wanted a public vindication of his father's memory, it was  indispensable that it should be composed in that language. The _Eikon_  was accordingly turned into Latin, by one of the royal chaplains,  Earle, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury. But this was not enough; a  defence in form was necessary, an _Apologia Socratis_, such as Plato  composed for his master after his death. It must not only be written  in Latin, but in such Latin as to ensure its being read.    In 1649 Charles II. was living at the Hague, and it so happened that  the man, who was in the highest repute in all Europe as a Latinist,  was professor at the neighbouring university of Leyden. Salmasius  (Claude de Saumaise) was commissioned to prepare a manifesto, which  should be at once a vindication of Charles's memory, and an indictment  against the regicide government. Salmasius was a man of enormous  reading and no judgment. He says of himself that he wrote Latin more  easily than his mother-tongue (French). And his Latin was all the  more readable because it was not classical or idiomatic. With all his  reading--and Isaac Casaubon had said of him when in his teens that he  had incredible "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#18)"],[1,"had them about the castle.\"    \"And you must pardon my frankness, messire,\" continued the male  ghost, \"but you cannot have moved widely in noble company if you are  indeed unable to distinguish between members of the feline species  and of the reigning family of Glathion.\"    \"Well, I have seen dowager queens who justified some such  confusion,\" observed Jurgen. \"Still, I entreat the forgiveness of  both of you, for I had no idea that I was addressing royalty.\"    \"I was King Smoit,\" explained the male phantom, \"and this was my  ninth wife, Queen Sylvia Tereu.\"    Jurgen bowed as gracefully, he flattered himself, as was possible in  his circumstances. It is not easy to bow gracefully while sitting  erect in bed.    \"Often and over again have I heard of you, King Smoit,\" says Jurgen.  \"You were the grandfather of Gogyrvan Gawr, and you murdered your  ninth wife, and your eighth wife, and your fifth wife, and your  third wife too: and you went under the title of the Black King, for  you were reputed the wickedest monarch that ever reigned in Glathion  and the Red Islands.\"    It seemed to Jurgen that King Smoit evinced embarrassment, but it is  hard to be quite certain when a ghost is blushing. \"Perhaps I was  spoken of in some such terms,\" says Smoit, \"for the neighbors were  censorious gossips, and I was not lucky in my marriages. And I  regret, I bitterly regret, to confess that, in a moment of extreme  yet not quite unprovoked excitement, I assassinated the lady whom  you now behold.\"    \"And I am sure, through no fault of mine,\" says Sylvia Tereu.    \"Certainly, my dear, you resisted with all your might. I only wish  that you had been a larger and a brawnier woman. But you, messire,  can now perceive, I suppose, the folly of expecting a high King of  Glathion, and the queen that he took delight in, to sit upon your  bed and howl?\"    So then, upon reflection, Jurgen admitted he had never had that  experience; nor, he handsomely added, could he recall any similar  incident among his friends.    \"The notion is certainly preposterous,\" went on King Smoit, and very  grimly he smiled. \"We are drawn hither by quite other intentions. In  fact, we wish to ask of you, as a member of the family, your  assistance in a delicate affair.\"    \"I would be delighted,\" Jurgen stated, \"to aid you in any possible  way. But why do you call me a member of the family?\"    \"Now, to deal frankly,\" says Smoit, with a grin, \"I am not claiming  any alliance with the Duke of Logreus--\"    \"Sometimes,\" says Jurgen, \"one prefers to travel incognito. As a  king, you ought to understand that.\"    --\"My interest is rather in the grandson of Steinvor. Now you will  remember your grandmother Steinvor as, I do not doubt, a charming  old lady. But I remember Steinvor, the wife of Ludwig, as one of the  loveliest girls that a king's eyes ever lighted on.\"    \"Oh, sir,\" says Jurgen, horrified, \"and what is this you are telling  me!\"    \"Merely that I had always an affectionate nature,\" replied King  Smoit, \"and that I was a fine upstanding young king in those days.  And one of the results of my being these things was your father,  whom men called Coth the son of Ludwig. But I can assure you Ludwig  had done nothing to deserve it.\"    \"Well, well!\" said Jurgen: \"all this is very scandalous: and very  upsetting, too, it is to have a brand-new grandfather foisted upon  you at this hour of the morning. Still, it happened a great while  ago: and if Ludwig did not fret over it, I see no reason why I  should do so. And besides, King Smoit, it may be that you are not  telling me the truth.\"    \"If you doubt my confession, messire my grandson, you have only to  look into the next mirror. It is precisely on this account that we  have ventured to dispel your slumbers. For to me you bear a striking  resemblance. You have the family face.\"    Now Jurgen considered the lineaments of King Smoit of Glathion.  \"Really,\" said Jurgen, \"of course it is very flattering to be told  that your appearance is regal. I do not at all know what to say in  reply to the implied compliment, without seeming uncivil. I would  never for a moment question that you were much admired in your day,  sir, and no doubt very justly so. None the less--well, my nose, now,  from such glimpses of it as mirrors have hitherto afforded, does not  appear to be a snub-nose.\"    \"Ah, but appearances are proverbially deceitful,\" observed King  Smoit.    \"And about the left hand corner,\" protested Queen Sylvia Tereu, \"I  detect a distinct resemblance.\"    \"Now I may seem unduly obtuse,\" said Jurgen, \"for I am a little  obtuse. It is a habit with me, a very bad habit formed in early  infancy, and I have never been able to break myself of it. And so I  have not any notion at what you two are aiming.\"    Replied the ghost of King Smoit: \"I will explain. Just sixty-three  years ago to-night I murdered my ninth wife in circumstances of  peculiar brutality, as you with rather questionable taste have  mentioned.\"    Then Jurgen was somewhat abashed, and felt that it did not become him,  who had so recently cut off the head of his own wife, to assume the airs  of a precisian. \"Of course,\" says Jurgen, more broad-mindedly, \"these  little family differences are always apt to occur in married life.\"    \"So be it! Though, by the so-and-sos of Ursula's eleven thousand  traveling companions, there was a time wherein I would not have  brooked such criticism. Ah, well, that time is overpast, and I am a  bloodless thing that the wind sweeps at the wind's will through  lands in which but yesterday King Smoit was dreaded. So I let that  which has been be.\"    \"Well, that seems reasonable,\" said Jurgen, \"and to be a trifle  rhetorical is the privilege of grandfathers. Therefore I entreat  you, sir, to continue.\"    \"Two years afterward I followed the Emperor Locrine in his  expedition against the Suevetii, an evil and luxurious people who  worship Gozarin peculiarly, by means of little boats. I must tell  you, grandson, that was a goodly raid, conducted by a band of tidy  fighters in a land of wealth and of fine women. But alack, as the  saying is, in our return from Osnach my loved general Locrine was  captured by that arch-fiend Duke Corineus of Cornwall: and I, among  many others who had followed the Emperor, paid for our merry  larcenies and throat-cuttings a very bitter price. Corineus was not  at all broadminded, not what you would call a man of the world. So  it was in a noisome dungeon that I was incarcerated,--I, Smoit of  Glathion, who conquered Enisgarth and Sargyll in open battle and  fearlessly married the heiress of Camwy! But I spare you the  unpleasant details. It suffices to say that I was dissatisfied with  my quarters. Yet fain to leave them as I became, there was but one  way. It involved the slaying of my gaoler, a step which was, I  confess, to me distasteful. I was getting on in life, and had grown  tired of killing people. Yet, to mature deliberation, the life of a  graceless varlet, void of all gentleness and with no bowels of  compassion, and deaf to suggestions of bribery, appeared of no  overwhelming importance.\"    \"I can readily imagine, grandfather, that you were not deeply  interested in either the nature or the anatomy of your gaoler. So  you did what was unavoidable.\"    \"Yes, I treacherously slew him, and escaped in an impenetrable  disguise to Glathion, where not long afterward I died. My dying  just then was most annoying, for I was on the point of being married,  and she was a remarkably attractive girl,--King Tyrnog's daughter,  from Craintnor way. She would have been my thirteenth wife. And not  a week before the ceremony I tripped and fell down my own castle  steps, and broke my neck. It was a humiliating end for one who had  been a warrior of considerable repute. Upon my word, it made me think  there might be something, after all, in those old superstitions about  thirteen being an unlucky number. But what was I saying?--oh, yes!  It is also unlucky to be careless about one's murders. You will  readily understand that for one or two such affairs I am condemned  yearly to haunt the scene of my crime on its anniversary: such  an arrangement is fair enough, and I make no complaint, though of  course it does rather break into the evening. But it happened that  I treacherously slew my gaoler with a large cobble-stone on the  fifteenth of June. Now the unfortunate part, the really awkward  feature, was that this was to an hour the anniversary of the death  of my ninth wife.\"    \"And you murdering insignificant strangers on such a day!\" said  Queen Sylvia. \"You climbing out of jail windows figged out as a lady  abbess, on an anniversary you ought to have kept on your knees in  unavailing repentance! But you were a hard man, Smoit, and it was  little loving courtesy you showed your wife at a time when she might  reasonably look to be remembered, and that is a fact.\"    \"My dear, I admit it was heedless of me. I could not possibly say  more. At any rate, grandson, I discovered after my decease that such  heedlessness entailed my haunting on every fifteenth of June at  three in the morning two separate places.\"    \"Well, but that was justice,\" says Jurgen.    \"It may have been justice,\" Smoit admitted: \"but my point is that  it happened to be impossible. However, I was aided by my  great-great-grandfather Penpingon Vreichvras ap Mylwald Glasanief.  He too had the family face; and in every way resembled me so  closely that he impersonated me to everyone's entire satisfaction;  and with my wife's assistance re-enacted my disastrous crime upon  the scene of its occurrence, June after June.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Queen Sylvia, \"he handled his sword infinitely better  than you, my dear. It was a thrilling pleasure to be murdered by  Penpingon Vreichvras ap Mylwald Glasanief, and I shall always regret  him.\"    \"For you must understand, grandson, that the term of King Penpingon  Vreichvras"]]]
