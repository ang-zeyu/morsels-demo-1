He resolved to wait for a good one, and Frank fooled him  by putting two straight ones right over the center of the plate. Gordon  felt sure that both would be curves, and so he offered at neither of  them. The umpire, however, who was a particular friend of Gordon, called  them both balls. Then Gordon went after the next ball, which was a  raise, but found nothing but empty air.    The third man was easy, and he fanned, also, making three in succession.    Parker punched Browning in the ribs.    \"Say,\" he observed, \"I'll go you two to one that Merriwell is on the  'Varsity team before the end of next season.\"    \"If he is alive he may be,\" returned the king, grimly.    Our hero's pitching was a surprise to his friends, for until that day he  had not seemed to let himself out. Even then he did not appear to be  doing his best work, and one who watched him in a friendly way fancied  he might do still better if forced to make the effort.    Walter Gordon was filled with disgust and dismay.    \"He's having great luck,\" muttered Gordon. \"Why, I don't see how I  missed a ball I struck at. Every one was a dead easy thing, and I should  have killed any of them.\"    He squirmed as he heard Burn Putnam--familiarly called Old Put--the  manager of the team, compliment Merriwell on his skillful work.    \"I fancy I'll be able to use you more than I thought I should at first,  Merriwell,\" said Putnam. \"We can tell more about that in the future.\"    \"I've got to strike that fellow out,\" thought Gordon as he went into the  box.    But he did not. Merriwell came first to bat in the second inning, and he  sent a safe single into right field, deliberately placing it, as was  evident to every ball player present.    Gordon turned green with anger, and then he became nervous. To add to  his nervousness, Merriwell obtained a lead from first and stole second  on his delivery, getting it easily.    But that was not the end of Gordon's woes, for Merriwell seemed in a  reckless mood, and he made for third on the next pitch, getting it on a  beautiful slide, although the catcher made an attempt to throw him out.    The catcher came down scowling, and Gordon went to meet him, asking as  he did so:    \"What's the matter with you? You ought to have stopped him at second and  held him there.\"    \"I ought to have stopped him!\" came derisively from the disgusted  backstop. \"I came down to ask you if this was the way you were going to  pitch in a regular game. Why, that fellow is getting a long start on  your delivery, and he does it every time. You've got to stop that kind  of business.\"    For some moments they talked, and then Gordon sulkily walked back to the  box. He tried to catch Frank playing off third, but simply wasted time.  Then he made a snap delivery and hit the batter, who went down to first.    By this time Gordon was rattled, and he sent the next ball over the  heart of the plate. The batter nailed it for two bags, and two men came  home.    Gordon walked out of the box and up to the bench where Old Put was  sitting.    \"I am sick,\" he declared.    He looked as if he spoke the truth.    \"I thought something was the matter with you,\" said the manager. \"You're  white as a sheet. It's folly for you to practice while you are in this  condition.\"    Gordon put on his sweater and then drew his coat over that. He wandered  off by himself and sat down.    \"Hang that fellow Merriwell!\" he whispered to himself. \"I never thought  he would bother me so much. I am beginning to hate him. He is too cool  and easy to suit me.\"    The practice was continued, and Merriwell showed up finely, so that Old  Put was pleased.    The sophomores quit trying to have sport with the freshmen, as it  happened that two of the professors had wandered into the park and were  looking on from a distance.    Browning saw them.    \"Why are they out here?\" he snapped. \"Never knew 'em to come before. I  won't even get a chance to talk to Merriwell.\"    \"Better keep away from him this afternoon,\" cautioned Hartwick. \"He  can't escape you, and there is plenty of time.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed Bruce. \"But I hate to think how he is crowing to  himself over the way the freshies got into the park. I'd like to take  the starch out of him at once.\"    Hartwick induced Browning to leave the park, and the departure of the  king caused the sophomores to wander away in small groups.    As a general thing they were discussing Merriwell, his position with the  freshmen, and his pitching. Some insisted that he was not a pitcher and  would never make one, while others were equally confident that he was  bound to become a great twirler some day.    Some of the groups discussed the antagonism between Merriwell and  Browning, and all were confident that the king would do the freshman  when he got himself into condition. It was not strange that they  believed so, for they remembered how Bruce had knocked out Kid Lajoie,  who was a professional.    Browning himself proceeded directly to his rooms, where he sat himself  down and fell to thinking. Twice had he been up against Merriwell, and  he had found out that the leader of the freshmen was no easy thing. In  neither struggle had he obtained an advantage through his own unaided  efforts, and in this last affair he had felt that he was losing his  wind, while Merriwell seemed as fresh as ever till he was thrown by a  third party.    \"That's where I am not yet his match,\" Bruce soberly decided. \"If I were  fortunate enough to land a knockout blow with my left at the outset I'd  finish him easily; but if he should play me and keep out of my reach he  might get me winded so he could finally get the best of it. I must work  off more flesh.\"    Having arrived at this conclusion, Browning was decidedly glad that his  friends had kept him from closing in on Merriwell and forcing a fight on  the ball field.    \"Another week will do it,\" Bruce thought. \"No matter what is said, I'll  not meet that fellow till I am his match--till I am more than his match,  for I must do him. If I do not my days as king of the sophs are  numbered. I can see now that some of the fellows sympathize secretly  with Merriwell, although they do not dare do so openly. It must be  stopped. He may be a first-class fellow, but when he treads on my corns  I kick.\"    Hartwick tried to talk to Bruce, but the latter would say very little,  and it was not long before he left the room.    Browning stepped out briskly, and a stranger who saw him could not have  believed that he had the reputation of being the laziest lad in college.    In one line Bruce was thoroughly aroused, but he was neglecting his  studies in a shameful manner, and more than once a warning voice told  him that while he was putting himself in condition to dispose of  Merriwell he was getting into trouble in another quarter.    He did not heed that warning, however. His one thought was to retain his  position as king of the sophomores, and in order to do that he must not  let any freshman triumph over him.    In town he went directly to a certain saloon and stopped at the bar,  although he did not order a drink.    \"Is the professor in?\" he asked.    \"I think he is,\" replied the barkeeper.    Then Browning passed through into a back room and climbed some dirty  stairs, finally rapping at a door.    \"Come in!\" called a harsh voice.    Bruce pushed open the door and entered. The room was quite large, but  was not very clean. The walls were pasted over with sporting pictures  taken from illustrated papers. There was a bed, some old chairs, one of  which had a broken back, a center table, a cracked mirror, and two  cuspidors. A door opened into another room beyond.    Lounging in a chair, with his feet on the table beside an empty beer  bottle and dirty glass, was a ruffianly-looking chap, who had a thick  neck that ran straight up with the back of his head. His hair was close  cropped and his forehead low. There was a bulldog look about his mouth  and jaw, and his forehead was strangely narrow.    The man was smoking a black, foul-smelling pipe, while the hands which  held a pink-tinted illustrated paper were enormous, with huge knuckles  and joints. His hand when closed looked formidable enough to knock down  an ox.    \"How do you do, professor?\" saluted Bruce.    \"Waryer,\" growled the man, still keeping his feet on the table. \"So it's  you, is it? Dis ain't your day.\"    \"I know it, but I decided to come around just the same. I am not  getting the flesh off as fast as I ought.\"    \"Hey?\" roared the man, letting his feet fall with a crash. \"Wot's dat?  D'yer men ter say I ain't doin' a good job wid yer? Wot der blazes!\"    \"Oh, you are doing all right, professor, but I find I must be in  condition sooner than I thought. My gymnasium exercise doesn't seem  to--\"    \"Dat gymnasium work is no good--see? I knows wot I'm givin' yer, too. I  told yer in der first place ter stick ter me, an' I'd put yer in shape.  It'll cost more, but--\"    \"I don't mind that. No matter what it costs, I must be in condition to  lick that fellow I was telling you about, and I must be in condition one  week from to-day.\"    \"Dat's business. I'll put yer dere. An' yer know wot I told yer--I'll  show yer a trick dat'll finish him dead sure ef de mug is gittin' de  best of yer. It'll cost yer twenty-five extra ter learn dat trick, but  it never fails.\"    Browning showed sudden interest.    \"I had forgotten about that,\" he said. \"What will it do?\"    \"It'll do der bloke what ye're after, dat's wot.\"    \"Yes, but how--how?\"    \"T'ink I'm goin' ter give der hull t'ing erway? Well, I should say nit!  I tells yer it'll fix him, and it'll fix him so dere won't be no more  fight in him. It'll paralyze him der first t'ing, an' he won't be no  better dan a stiff.\"    \"How bad will it hurt him?\"    The man paused a moment and then added:    \"Well, I don't mind"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11123"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 01 (#19)"],[1,"the oxen and wagon.  Naked, now in her arms the new-born infant is lying,  And but little the help our friends will be able to furnish,  If in the neighboring village, indeed, where to-day we would rest us,  Still we shall find them; though much do I fear they already have                                                       passed it.  Shouldst thou have linen to spare of any description, provided  Thou of this neighborhood art, to the poor in charity give it.'    \"Thus she spoke, and the pale-faced mother raised herself feebly  Up from the straw, and toward me looked. Then said I in answer  'Surely unto the good, a spirit from heaven oft speaketh,  Making them feel the distress that threatens a suffering brother.  For thou must know that my mother, already presaging thy sorrows,  Gave me a bundle to use it straightway for the need of the naked.'  Then I untied the knots of the string, and the wrapper of father's  Unto her gave, and gave her as well the shirts and the linen.  And she thanked me with joy, and cried: 'The happy believe not  Miracles yet can be wrought: for only in need we acknowledge  God's own hand and finger, that leads the good to show goodness.  What unto us He has done through thee, may He do to thee also!'  And I beheld with what pleasure the sick woman handled the linens,  But with especial delight the dressing-gown's delicate flannel.  'Let us make haste,' the maid to her said, 'and come to the village,  Where our people will halt for the night and already are resting.  There these clothes for the children I, one and all, straightway                                                  will portion.'  Then she saluted again, her thanks most warmly expressing,  Started the oxen; the wagon went on; but there I still lingered,  Still held the horses in check; for now my heart was divided  Whether to drive with speed to the village, and there the provisions  Share 'mong the rest of the people, or whether I here to the maiden  All should deliver at once, for her discreetly to portion.  And in an instant my heart had decided, and quietly driving  After the maiden, I soon overtook her, and said to her quickly:  'Hearken, good maiden;--my mother packed up not linen-stuffs only  Into the carriage, that I should have clothes to furnish the naked;  Wine and beer she added besides, and supply of provisions:  Plenty of all these things I have in the box of the carriage.  But now I feel myself moved to deliver these offerings also  Into thy hand; for so shall I best fulfil my commission.  Thou wilt divide them with judgment, while I must by chance be directed.'  Thereupon answered the maiden: 'I will with faithfulness portion  These thy gifts, that all shall bring comfort to those who are needy.'  Thus she spoke, and quickly the bog of the carriage I opened,  Brought forth thence the substantial hams, and brought out the                                                   breadstuffs,  Bottles of wine and beer, and one and all gave to the maiden.  Willingly would I have given her more, but the carriage was empty.  All she packed at the sick woman's feet, and went on her journey.  I, with my horses and carriage, drove rapidly back to the city.\"    Instantly now, when Hermann had ceased, the talkative neighbor  Took up the word, and cried: \"Oh happy, in days like the present,  Days of flight and confusion, who lives by himself in his dwelling,  Having no wife nor child to be clinging about him in terror!  Happy I feel myself now, and would not for much be called father;  Would not have wife and children to-day, for whom to be anxious.  Oft have I thought of this flight before; and have packed up together  All my best things already, the chains and old pieces of money  That were my sainted mother's, of which not one has been sold yet.  Much would be left behind, it is true, not easily gotten.  Even the roots and the herbs, that were with such industry gathered,  I should be sorry to lose, though the worth of the goods is but trifling.  If my purveyor remained, I could go from my dwelling contented.  When my cash I have brought away safe, and have rescued my person,  All is safe: none find it so easy to fly as the single.\"    \"Neighbor,\" unto his words young Hermann with emphasis answered:  \"I can in no wise agree with thee here, and censure thy language.  Is he indeed a man to be prized, who, in good and in evil,  Takes no thought but for self, and gladness and sorrow with others  Knows not how to divide, nor feels his heart so impel him?  Rather than ever to-day would I make up my mind to be married:  Many a worthy maiden is needing a husband's protection,  And the man needs an inspiriting wife when ill is impending.\"    Thereupon smiling the father replied: \"Thus love I to hear thee!  That is a sensible word such as rarely I've known thee to utter.\"  Straightway, however, the mother broke in with quickness, exclaiming:  \"Son, to be sure, thou art right! we parents have set the example;  Seeing that not in our season of joy did we choose one another;  Rather the saddest of hours it was that bound us together.  Monday morning--I mind it well; for the day that preceded  Came that terrible fire by which our city was ravaged--  Twenty years will have gone. The day was a Sunday as this is;  Hot and dry was the season; the water was almost exhausted.  All the people were strolling abroad in their holiday dresses,  'Mong the villages partly, and part in the mills and the taverns.  And at the end of the city the flames began, and went coursing  Quickly along the streets, creating a draught in their passage.  Burned were the barns where the copious harvest already was garnered;  Burned were the streets as far as the market; the house of my father,  Neighbor to this, was destroyed, and this one also fell with it.  Little we managed to save. I sat, that sorrowful night through,  Outside the town on the common, to guard the beds and the boxes.  Sleep overtook me at last, and when I again was awakened,  Feeling the chill of the morning that always descends before sunrise,  There were the smoke and the glare, and the walls and chimneys in ruins.  Then fell a weight on my heart; but more majestic than ever  Came up the sun again, inspiring my bosom with courage.  Then I rose hastily up, with a yearning the place to revisit  Whereon our dwelling had stood, and to see if the hens had been rescued,  Which I especially loved, for I still was a child in my feelings.  Thus as I over the still-smoking timbers of house and of court-yard  Picked my way, and beheld the dwelling so ruined and wasted,  Thou camest up to examine the place, from the other direction.  Under the ruins thy horse in his stall had been buried; the rubbish  Lay on the spot and the glimmering beams; of the horse we saw nothing.  Thoughtful and grieving we stood there thus, each facing the other,  Now that the wall was fallen that once had divided our court-yards.  Thereupon thou by the hand didst take me, and speak to me, saying,--  'Lisa, how camest thou hither? Go back! thy soles must be burning;  Hot the rubbish is here: it scorches my boots, which are stronger.'  And thou didst lift me up, and carry me out through thy court-yard.  There was the door of the house left standing yet with its archway,  Just as 'tis standing now, the one thing only remaining.  Then thou didst set me down and kiss me; to that I objected;  But thou didst answer and say with kindly significant language:  'See! my house lies in ruins: remain here and help me rebuild it;  So shall my help in return be given to building thy father's.'  Yet did I not comprehend thee until thou sentest thy mother  Unto my father, and quick were the happy espousals accomplished.  E'en to this day I remember with joy those half-consumed timbers,  And I can see once more the sun coming up in such splendor;  For 'twas the day that gave me my husband; and, ere the first season  Passed of that wild desolation, a son to my youth had been given.  Therefore I praise thee, Hermann, that thou, with an honest assurance,  Shouldst, in these sorrowful days, be thinking thyself of a maiden,  And amid ruins and war shouldst thus have the courage to woo her.\"    Straightway, then, and with warmth, the father replied to her, saying:  \"Worthy of praise is the feeling, and truthful also the story,  Mother, that thou hast related; for so indeed every thing happened.  Better, however, is better. It is not the business of all men  Thus their life and estate to begin from the very foundation:  Every one needs not to worry himself as we and the rest did.  Oh, how happy is he whose father and mother shall give him,  Furnished and ready, a house which he can adorn with his increase.  Every beginning is hard; but most the beginning a household.  Many are human wants, and every thing daily grows dearer,  So that a man must consider the means of increasing his earnings.  This I hope therefore of thee, my Hermann, that into our dwelling  Thou wilt be bringing ere long a bride who is handsomely dowered;  For it is meet that a gallant young man have an opulent maiden.  Great is the comfort of home whene'er, with the woman elected,  Enter the useful presents, besides, in box and in basket.  Not for this many a year in vain has the mother been busy  Making her daughter's linens of strong and delicate texture;  God-parents have not in vain been giving their vessels of silver,  And the father laid by in his desk the rare pieces of money;  For there a day will come when she, with her gifts and possessions,  Shall that youth rejoice who has chosen her out of all others.  Well do I know how good in a house is a woman's position,  Who her own furniture round her knows, in kitchen and chamber;  Who herself the bed and herself the table has covered.  Only a well-dowered bride should I like to receive to my dwelling.  She who is poor is sure, in the end, to be scorned by her husband;  And will as servant be held, who as servant came in with "]]]
