This is most unfortunate for youth, and for their sake a  work of rescue and revival is greatly needed; for it is perhaps, not  excepting even music, the completest language of the emotions and can  be made one of the best schools of sentiment and even will,  inculcating good states of mind and exorcising bad ones as few other  agencies have power to do. Right dancing can cadence the very soul,  give nervous poise and control, bring harmony between basal and finer  muscles, and also between feeling and intellect, body and mind. It can  serve both as an awakener and a test of intelligence, predispose the  heart against vice, and turn the springs of character toward virtue.  That its present decadent forms, for those too devitalized to dance  aright, can be demoralizing, we know in this day too well, although  even questionable dances may sometimes work off vicious propensities  in ways more harmless than those in which they would otherwise find  vent. Its utilization for and influence on the insane would be another  interesting chapter.    Very interesting scientifically and suggestive practically is another  correspondence which I believe to be new, between the mode of  spontaneous activity in youth and that of labor in the early history  of the race. One of the most marked distinctions between savage and  civilized races is in the longer rhythm of work and relaxation. The  former are idle and lazy for days, weeks, and perhaps months, and then  put forth intense and prolonged effort in dance, hunt, warfare,  migration, or construction, sometimes dispensing with sleep and  manifesting remarkable endurance. As civilization and specialization  advance, hours become regular. The cultured man is less desultory in  all his habits, from eating and sleeping to performing social and  religious duties, although he may put forth no more aggregate energy  in a year than the savage. Women are schooled to regular work long  before men, and the difficulty of imposing civilization upon low races  is compared by Buecher[8] to that of training a eat to work when  harnessed to a dog-cart. It is not dread of fatigue but of the  monotony of method makes them hate labor. The effort of savages is  more intense and their periods of rest more prolonged and inert.  Darwin thinks all vital function bred to go in periods, as vertebrates  are descended from tidal ascidian.[9] There is indeed much that  suggests some other irregular rhythm more or less independent of day  and night, and perhaps sexual in its nature, but not lunar, and for  males. This mode of life not only preceded the industrial and  commercial period of which regularity is a prime condition, but it  lasted indefinitely longer than the latter has yet existed; during  this early time great exertion, sometimes to the point of utter  exhaustion and collapse, alternated with seasons of almost vegetative  existence. We see abundant traces of this psychosis in the muscle  habits of adolescents, and, I think, in student and particularly in  college life, which can enforce regularity only to a limited extent.  This is not reversion, but partly expression of the nature and perhaps  the needs of this stage of immaturity, and partly the same instinct of  revolt against uniformity imposed from without, which rob life of  variety and extinguish the spirit of adventure and untrammeled  freedom, and make the savage hard to break to the harness of  civilization. The hunger for fatigue, too, can become a veritable  passion and is quite distinct from either the impulse for activity for  its own sake or the desire of achievement. To shout and put forth the  utmost possible strength in crude ways is erethic intoxication at a  stage when every tissue can become erectile and seems, like the crying  of infants, to have a legitimate function in causing tension and  flushing, enlarging the caliber of blood vessels, and forcing the  blood perhaps even to the point of extravasation to irrigate newly  growing fibers, cells, and organs which atrophy if not thus fed. When  maturity is complete this need abates. If this be correct, the  phenomenon of second breath, so characteristic of adolescence, and one  factor in the inebriate's propensity, is ontogenetic expression of a  rhythm trait of a long racial period. Youth needs overexertion to  compensate for underexertion, to undersleep in order to offset  oversleep at times. This seems to be nature's provision to expand in  all directions its possibilities of the body and soul in this plastic  period when, without this occasional excess, powers would atrophy or  suffer arrest for want of use, or larger possibilities world not be  realized without this regimen peculiar to nascent periods. This is  treated more fully elsewhere.    Perhaps next to dancing in phyletic motivation come personal  conflicts, such as wrestling, fighting, boxing, dueling, and in some  sense, hunting. The animal world is full of struggle for survival, and  primitive warfare is a wager of battle, of personal combat of foes  contesting eye to eye and hand to hand, where victory of one is the  defeat and perhaps death of the other, and where life is often staked  against life. In its more brutal forms we see one of the most  degrading of all the aspects of human nature. Burk[10] has shown how  the most bestial of these instincts survive and crop out irresistibly  in boyhood, where fights are often engaged in with desperate abandon.  Noses are bitten, ears torn, sensitive places kicked, hair pulled,  arms twisted, the head stamped on and pounded on stones, fingers  twisted, and hoodlums sometimes deliberately try to strangle, gouge  out an eye, pull off an ear, pull out the tongue, break teeth, nose,  or bones, or dislocate jaws or other joints, wring the neck, bite off  a lip, and torture in utterly nameless ways. In unrestrained anger,  man becomes a demon in love with the blood of his victim. The face is  distorted, and there are yells, oaths, animal snorts and grunts,  cries, and then exultant laughter at pain, and each is bruised, dirty,  disheveled and panting with exhaustion. For coarser natures, the  spectacle of such conflicts has an intense attraction, while some  morbid souls are scarred by a distinct phobia for everything  suggestive of even lower degrees of opposition. These instincts, more  or less developed in boyhood, are repressed in normal cases before  strength and skill are sufficiently developed to inflict serious  bodily injury, while without the reductives that orthogenetic growth  brings they become criminal. Repulsive as are these grosser and animal  manifestations of anger, its impulsion can not and should not be  eliminated, but its expression transformed and directed toward evils  that need all its antagonism. To be angry aright is a good part of  moral education, and non-resistance under all provocations is unmanly,  craven, and cowardly.[11] An able-bodied young man, who can not fight  physically, can hardly have a high and true sense of honor, and is  generally a milksop, a lady-boy, or sneak. He lacks virility, his  masculinity does not ring true, his honesty can not be sound to the  core. Hence, instead of eradicating this instinct, one of the great  problems of physical and moral pedagogy is rightly to temper and  direct it.    Sparta sedulously cultivated it in boys; and in the great English  schools, where for generations it has been more or less tacitly  recognized, it is regulated by custom, and their literature and  traditions abound in illustrations of its man-making and often  transforming influence in ways well appreciated by Hughes and Arnold.  It makes against degeneration, the essential feature of which is  weakening of will and loss of honor. Real virtue requires enemies, and  women and effeminate and old men want placid, comfortable peace, while  a real man rejoices in noble strife which sanctifies all great causes,  casts out fear, and is the chief school of courage. Bad as is  overpugnacity, a scrapping boy is better than one who funks a fight,  and I have no patience with the sentimentality that would here \"pour  out the child with the bath,\" but would have every healthy boy taught  boxing at adolescence if not before. The prize-ring is degrading and  brutal, but in lieu of better illustrations of the spirit of personal  contest I would interest a certain class of boys in it and try to  devise modes of pedagogic utilization of the immense store of interest  it generates. Like dancing it should be rescued from its evil  associations, and its educational force put to do moral work, even  though it be by way of individual prescriptions for specific defects  of character. At its best, it is indeed a manly art, a superb school  for quickness of eye and hand, decision, force of will, and  self-control. The moment this is lost stinging punishment follows.  Hence it is the surest of all cures for excessive irascibility and has  been found to have a most beneficent effect upon a peevish or unmanly  disposition. It has no mean theoretic side, of rules, kinds of blow  and counters, arts of drawing out and tiring an opponent, hindering  but not injuring him, defensive and offensive tactics, etc., and it  addresses chiefly the fundamental muscles in both training and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/92"],[0,"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (#18)"],[1,"ntor, realizing that his prey had escaped him, set up once  more his hideous trumpeting and followed at a rapid charge upon their  trail.          14    A Priestess But Yet a Woman      At first La closed her eyes and clung to Tarzan in terror, though she  made no outcry; but presently she gained sufficient courage to look  about her, to look down at the ground beneath and even to keep her eyes  open during the wide, perilous swings from tree to tree, and then there  came over her a sense of safety because of her confidence in the  perfect physical creature in whose strength and nerve and agility her  fate lay.  Once she raised her eyes to the burning sun and murmured a  prayer of thanks to her pagan god that she had not been permitted to  destroy this godlike man, and her long lashes were wet with tears.  A  strange anomaly was La of Opar--a creature of circumstance torn by  conflicting emotions.  Now the cruel and bloodthirsty creature of a  heartless god and again a melting woman filled with compassion and  tenderness.  Sometimes the incarnation of jealousy and revenge and  sometimes a sobbing maiden, generous and forgiving; at once a virgin  and a wanton; but always--a woman.  Such was La.    She pressed her cheek close to Tarzan's shoulder.  Slowly she turned  her head until her hot lips were pressed against his flesh.  She loved  him and would gladly have died for him; yet within an hour she had been  ready to plunge a knife into his heart and might again within the  coming hour.    A hapless priest seeking shelter in the jungle chanced to show himself  to enraged Tantor.  The great beast turned to one side, bore down upon  the crooked, little man, snuffed him out and then, diverted from his  course, blundered away toward the south.  In a few minutes even the  noise of his trumpeting was lost in the distance.    Tarzan dropped to the ground and La slipped to her feet from his back.  \"Call your people together,\" said Tarzan.    \"They will kill me,\" replied La.    \"They will not kill you,\" contradicted the ape-man.  \"No one will kill  you while Tarzan of the Apes is here.  Call them and we will talk with  them.\"    La raised her voice in a weird, flutelike call that carried far into  the jungle on every side.  From near and far came answering shouts in  the barking tones of the Oparian priests: \"We come!  We come!\" Again  and again, La repeated her summons until singly and in pairs the  greater portion of her following approached and halted a short distance  away from the High Priestess and her savior.  They came with scowling  brows and threatening mien.  When all had come Tarzan addressed them.    \"Your La is safe,\" said the ape-man.  \"Had she slain me she would now  herself be dead and many more of you; but she spared me that I might  save her.  Go your way with her back to Opar, and Tarzan will go his  way into the jungle. Let there be peace always between Tarzan and La.  What is your answer?\"    The priests grumbled and shook their heads.  They spoke together and La  and Tarzan could see that they were not favorably inclined toward the  proposition.  They did not wish to take La back and they did wish to  complete the sacrifice of Tarzan to the Flaming God.  At last the  ape-man became impatient.    \"You will obey the commands of your queen,\" he said, \"and go back to  Opar with her or Tarzan of the Apes will call together the other  creatures of the jungle and slay you all.  La saved me that I might  save you and her.  I have served you better alive than I could have  dead.  If you are not all fools you will let me go my way in peace and  you will return to Opar with La.  I know not where the sacred knife is;  but you can fashion another.  Had I not taken it from La you would have  slain me and now your god must be glad that I took it since I have  saved his priestess from love-mad Tantor.  Will you go back to Opar  with La, promising that no harm shall befall her?\"    The priests gathered together in a little knot arguing and discussing.  They pounded upon their breasts with their fists; they raised their  hands and eyes to their fiery god; they growled and barked among  themselves until it became evident to Tarzan that one of their number  was preventing the acceptance of his proposal.  This was the High  Priest whose heart was filled with jealous rage because La openly  acknowledged her love for the stranger, when by the worldly customs of  their cult she should have belonged to him. Seemingly there was to be  no solution of the problem until another priest stepped forth and,  raising his hand, addressed La.    \"Cadj, the High Priest,\" he announced, \"would sacrifice you both to the  Flaming God; but all of us except Cadj would gladly return to Opar with  our queen.\"    \"You are many against one,\" spoke up Tarzan.  \"Why should you not have  your will?  Go your way with La to Opar and if Cadj interferes slay  him.\"    The priests of Opar welcomed this suggestion with loud cries of  approval.  To them it appeared nothing short of divine inspiration.  The influence of ages of unquestioning obedience to high priests had  made it seem impossible to them to question his authority; but when  they realized that they could force him to their will they were as  happy as children with new toys.    They rushed forward and seized Cadj.  They talked in loud menacing  tones into his ear.  They threatened him with bludgeon and knife until  at last he acquiesced in their demands, though sullenly, and then  Tarzan stepped close before Cadj.    \"Priest,\" he said, \"La goes back to her temple under the protection of  her priests and the threat of Tarzan of the Apes that whoever harms her  shall die.  Tarzan will go again to Opar before the next rains and if  harm has befallen La, woe betide Cadj, the High Priest.\"    Sullenly Cadj promised not to harm his queen.    \"Protect her,\" cried Tarzan to the other Oparians.  \"Protect her so  that when Tarzan comes again he will find La there to greet him.\"    \"La will be there to greet thee,\" exclaimed the High Priestess, \"and La  will wait, longing, always longing, until you come again.  Oh, tell me  that you will come!\"    \"Who knows?\" asked the ape-man as he swung quickly into the trees and  raced off toward the east.    For a moment La stood looking after him, then her head drooped, a sigh  escaped her lips and like an old woman she took up the march toward  distant Opar.    Through the trees raced Tarzan of the Apes until the darkness of night  had settled upon the jungle, then he lay down and slept, with no  thought beyond the morrow and with even La but the shadow of a memory  within his consciousness.    But a few marches to the north Lady Greystoke looked forward to the day  when her mighty lord and master should discover the crime of Achmet  Zek, and be speeding to rescue and avenge, and even as she pictured the  coming of John Clayton, the object of her thoughts squatted almost  naked, beside a fallen log, beneath which he was searching with grimy  fingers for a chance beetle or a luscious grub.    Two days elapsed following the theft of the jewels before Tarzan gave  them a thought.  Then, as they chanced to enter his mind, he conceived  a desire to play with them again, and, having nothing better to do than  satisfy the first whim which possessed him, he rose and started across  the plain from the forest in which he had spent the preceding day.    Though no mark showed where the gems had been buried, and though the  spot resembled the balance of an unbroken stretch several miles in  length, where the reeds terminated at the edge of the meadowland, yet  the ape-man moved with unerring precision directly to the place where  he had hid his treasure.    With his hunting knife he upturned the loose earth, beneath which the  pouch should be; but, though he excavated to a greater distance than  the depth of the original hole there was no sign of pouch or jewels.  Tarzan's brow clouded as he discovered that he had been despoiled.  Little or no reasoning was required to convince him of the identity of  the guilty party, and with the same celerity that had marked his  decision to unearth the jewels, he set out upon the trail of the thief.    Though the spoor was two days old, and practically obliterated in many  places, Tarzan followed it with comparative ease.  A white man could  not have followed it twenty paces twelve hours after it had been made,  a black man would have lost it within the first mile; but Tarzan of the  Apes had been forced in childhood to develop senses that an ordinary  mortal scarce ever uses.    We may note the garlic and whisky on the breath of a fellow strap  hanger, or the cheap perfume emanating from the person of the wondrous  lady sitting in front of us, and deplore the fact of our sensitive  noses; but, as a matter of fact, we cannot smell at all, our olfactory  organs are practically atrophied, by comparison with the development of  the sense among the beasts of the wild.    Where a foot is placed an effluvium remains for a considerable time.  It is beyond the range of our sensibilities; but to a creature of the  lower orders, especially to the hunters and the hunted, as interesting  and ofttimes more lucid than is the printed page to us.    Nor was Tarzan dependent alone upon his sense of smell.  Vision and  hearing had been brought to a marvelous state of development by the  necessities of his early life, where survival itself depended almost  daily upon the exercise of the keenest vigilance and the constant use  of all his faculties.    And so he followed the old trail of the Belgian through the forest and  toward the north; but because of the age of the trail he was  constrained to a far from rapid progress.  The man he followed was two  days ahead of him when Tarzan took up the pursuit, and each day he  gained upon the ape-man.  The latter, however, felt not the slightest  doubt as to the outcome.  Some day he would overhaul his quarry--h"]]]
