We all hoped that he  would mount and ride out to the herd, for though he was a good  story-teller and meaty with personal experiences, where he thought  they would pass muster he was inclined to overcolor his statements. We  usually gave him respectful attention, but were frequently compelled  to regard him as a cheerful, harmless liar. So when he showed no  disposition to go, we knew we were in for one from him.    \"When I was boss bull-whacker,\" he began, \"for a big army sutler at  Fort Concho, I used to make two round trips a month with my train. It  was a hundred miles to wagon from the freight point where we got our  supplies. I had ten teams, six and seven yoke to the team, and trail  wagons to each. I was furnished a night herder and a cook, saddle  horses for both night herder and myself. You hear me, it was a slam up  fine layout. We could handle three or four tons to the team, and with  the whole train we could chamber two car loads of anything. One day we  were nearing the fort with a mixed cargo of freight, when a messenger  came out and met us with an order from the sutler. He wanted us to  make the fort that night and unload. The mail buckboard had reported  us to the sutler as camped out back on a little creek about ten miles.  We were always entitled to a day to unload and drive back to camp,  which gave us good grass for the oxen, but under the orders the whips  popped merrily that afternoon, and when they all got well strung out,  I rode in ahead, to see what was up. Well, it seems that four  companies of infantry from Fort McKavett, which were out for field  practice, were going to be brought into this post to be paid three  months' wages. This, with the troops stationed at Concho, would turn  loose quite a wad of money. The sutler called me into his office when  I reached the fort, and when he had produced a black bottle used for  cutting the alkali in your drinking water, he said, 'Jack,'--he called  me Jack; my full name is John Quincy Forrest,--'Jack, can you make the  round trip, and bring in two cars of bottled beer that will be on the  track waiting for you, and get back by pay day, the 10th?'    \"I figured the time in my mind; it was twelve days.    \"'There's five extra in it for each man for the trip, and I'll make it  right with you,' he added, as he noticed my hesitation, though I was  only making a mental calculation.    \"'Why, certainly, Captain,' I said. 'What's that fable about the jack  rabbit and the land tarrapin?' He didn't know and I didn't either, so  I said to illustrate the point: 'Put your freight on a bull train, and  it always goes through on time. A race horse can't beat an ox on a  hundred miles and repeat to a freight wagon.' Well, we unloaded before  night, and it was pitch dark before we made camp. I explained the  situation to the men. We planned to go in empty in five days, which  would give us seven to come back loaded. We made every camp on time  like clockwork. The fifth morning we were anxious to get a daybreak  start, so we could load at night. The night herder had his orders to  bring in the oxen the first sign of day, and I called the cook an hour  before light. When the oxen were brought in, the men were up and ready  to go to yoking. But the nigh wheeler in Joe Jenk's team, a big  brindle, muley ox, a regular pet steer, was missing. I saw him myself,  Joe saw him, and the night herder swore he came in with the rest.  Well, we looked high and low for that Mr. Ox, but he had vanished.  While the men were eating their breakfast, I got on my horse and the  night herder and I scoured and circled that country for miles around,  but no ox. The country was so bare and level that a jack rabbit needed  to carry a fly for shade. I was worried, for we needed every ox and  every moment of time. I ordered Joe to tie his mate behind the trail  wagon and pull out one ox shy.    \"Well, fellows, that thing worried me powerful. Half the teamsters,  good, honest, truthful men as ever popped a whip, swore they saw that  ox when they came in. Well, it served a strong argument that a man can  be positive and yet be mistaken. We nooned ten miles from our night  camp that day. Jerry Wilkens happened to mention it at dinner that he  believed his trail needed greasing. 'Why,' said Jerry, 'you'd think  that I was loaded, the way my team kept their chains taut.' I noticed  Joe get up from dinner before he had finished, as if an idea had  struck him. He went over and opened the sheet in Jerry's trail wagon,  and a smile spread over his countenance. 'Come here, fellows,' was all  he said.    \"We ran over to the wagon and there\"--    The boys turned their backs with indistinct mutterings of disgust.    \"You all don't need to believe this if you don't want to, but there  was the missing ox, coiled up and sleeping like a bear in the wagon.  He even had Jerry's roll of bedding for a pillow. You see, the wagon  sheet was open in front, and he had hopped up on the trail tongue and  crept in there to steal a ride. Joe climbed into the wagon, and gave  him a few swift kicks in the short ribs, when he opened his eyes,  yawned, got up, and jumped out.\"    Bull was rolling a cigarette before starting, while Fox's night horse  was hard to bridle, which hindered them. With this slight delay,  Forrest turned his horse back and continued: \"That same ox on the next  trip, one night when we had the wagons parked into a corral, got away  from the herder, tip-toed over the men's beds in the gate, stood on  his hind legs long enough to eat four fifty-pound sacks of flour out  of the rear end of a wagon, got down on his side, and wormed his way  under the wagon back into the herd, without being detected or waking a  man.\"    As they rode away to relieve the first guard, McCann said, \"Isn't he a  muzzle-loading daisy? If I loved a liar I'd hug that man to death.\"    The absence of our foreman made no difference. We all knew our places  on guard. Experience told us there would be no trouble that night.  After Wyatt Roundtree and Moss Strayhorn had made down their bed and  got into it, Wyatt remarked,--    \"Did you ever notice, old sidey, how hard this ground is?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Moss, as he turned over, hunting for a soft spot, \"it  is hard, but we'll forget all that when this trip ends. Brother, dear,  just think of those long slings with red cherries floating around in  them that we'll be drinking, and picture us smoking cigars in a blaze.  That thought alone ought to make a hard bed both soft and warm. Then  to think we'll ride all the way home on the cars.\"    McCann banked his fire, and the first guard, Wheat, Stallings, and  Borrowstone, rode in from the herd, all singing an old chorus that had  been composed, with little regard for music or sense, about a hotel  where they had stopped the year before:--         \"Sure it's one cent for coffee and two cents for bread,       Three for a steak and five for a bed,       Sea breeze from the gutter wafts a salt water smell,       To the festive cowboy in the Southwestern hotel.\"        CHAPTER X    \"NO MAN'S LAND\"    Flood overtook us the next morning, and as a number of us gathered  round him to hear the news, told us of a letter that Mann had got at  Doan's, stating that the first herd to pass Camp Supply had been  harassed by Indians. The \"Running W\" people, Mann's employers, had a  representative at Dodge, who was authority for the statement. Flood  had read the letter, which intimated that an appeal would be made to  the government to send troops from either Camp Supply or Fort Sill to  give trail herds a safe escort in passing the western border of this  Indian reservation. The letter, therefore, admonished Mann, if he  thought the Indians would give any trouble, to go up the south side of  Red River as far as the Pan-handle of Texas, and then turn north to  the government trail at Fort Elliot.    \"I told Mann,\" said our foreman, \"that before I'd take one step  backward, or go off on a wild goose chase through that Pan-handle  country, I'd go back home and start over next year on the Chisholm  trail. It's the easiest thing in the world for some big auger to sit  in a hotel somewhere and direct the management of a herd. I don't look  for no soldiers to furnish an escort; it would take the government six  months to get a move on her, even in an emergency. I left Billy Mann  in a quandary; he doesn't know what to do. That big auger at Dodge is  troubling him, for if he don't act on his advice, and loses cattle as  the result--well, he'll never boss any more herds for King and  Kennedy. So, boys, if we're ever to see the Blackfoot Agency, there's  but one course for us to take, and that's straight ahead. As old  Oliver Loving, the first Texas cowman that ever drove a herd, used to  say, 'Never borrow trouble, or cross a river before you reach it.' So  when the cattle are through grazing, let them hit the trail north.  It's entirely too late for us to veer away from any Indians.\"    We were following the regular trail, which had been slightly used for  a year or two, though none of our outfit had ever been over it, when  late on the third afternoon, about forty miles out from Doan's, about  a hundred mounted bucks and squaws sighted our herd and crossed the  North Fork from their encampment. They did not ride direct to the  herd, but came into the trail nearly a mile above the cattle, so it  was some little time from"]]]
