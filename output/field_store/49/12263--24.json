He  was master.  It would now be he who could laugh and shoot the shafts of  derision.    The friend had, in a weak hour, spoken with sobs of his own death.  He  had delivered a melancholy oration previous to his funeral, and had  doubtless in the packet of letters, presented various keepsakes to  relatives.  But he had not died, and thus he had delivered himself into  the hands of the youth.    The latter felt immensely superior to his friend, but he inclined to  condescension.  He adopted toward him an air of patronizing good humor.    His self-pride was now entirely restored.  In the shade of its  flourishing growth he stood with braced and self-confident legs, and  since nothing could now be discovered he did not shrink from an  encounter with the eyes of judges, and allowed no thoughts of his own  to keep him from an attitude of manfulness.  He had performed his  mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man.    Indeed, when he remembered his fortunes of yesterday, and looked at  them from a distance he began to see something fine there.  He had  license to be pompous and veteranlike.    His panting agonies of the past he put out of his sight.    In the present, he declared to himself that it was only the doomed and  the damned who roared with sincerity at circumstance.  Few but they  ever did it.  A man with a full stomach and the respect of his fellows  had no business to scold about anything that he might think to be wrong  in the ways of the universe, or even with the ways of society.  Let the  unfortunates rail; the others may play marbles.    He did not give a great deal of thought to these battles that lay  directly before him.  It was not essential that he should plan his ways  in regard to them.  He had been taught that many obligations of a life  were easily avoided.  The lessons of yesterday had been that  retribution was a laggard and blind.  With these facts before him he  did not deem it necessary that he should become feverish over the  possibilities of the ensuing twenty-four hours.  He could leave much to  chance.  Besides, a faith in himself had secretly blossomed.  There was  a little flower of confidence growing within him.  He was now a man of  experience.  He had been out among the dragons, he said, and he assured  himself that they were not so hideous as he had imagined them.  Also,  they were inaccurate; they did not sting with precision.  A stout heart  often defied, and defying, escaped.    And, furthermore, how could they kill him who was the chosen of gods  and doomed to greatness?    He remembered how some of the men had run from the battle.  As he  recalled their terror-struck faces he felt a scorn for them.  They had  surely been more fleet and more wild than was absolutely necessary.  They were weak mortals.  As for himself, he had fled with discretion  and dignity.    He was aroused from this reverie by his friend, who, having hitched  about nervously and blinked at the trees for a time, suddenly coughed  in an introductory way, and spoke.    \"Fleming!\"    \"What?\"    The friend put his hand up to his mouth and coughed again.  He fidgeted  in his jacket.    \"Well,\" he gulped at last, \"I guess yeh might as well give me back them  letters.\"  Dark, prickling blood had flushed into his cheeks and brow.    \"All right, Wilson,\" said the youth.  He loosened two buttons of his  coat, thrust in his hand, and brought forth the packet.  As he extended  it to his friend the latter's face was turned from him.    He had been slow in the act of producing the packet because during it  he had been trying to invent a remarkable comment on the affair.  He  could conjure up nothing of sufficient point.  He was compelled to  allow his friend to escape unmolested with his packet.  And for this he  took unto himself considerable credit.  It was a generous thing.    His friend at his side seemed suffering great shame.  As he  contemplated him, the youth felt his heart grow more strong and stout.  He had never been compelled to blush in such manner for his acts; he  was an individual of extraordinary virtues.    He reflected, with condescending pity:  \"Too bad!  Too bad!  The poor  devil, it makes him feel tough!\"    After this incident, and as he reviewed the battle pictures he had  seen, he felt quite competent to return home and make the hearts of the  people glow with stories of war.  He could see himself in a room of  warm tints telling tales to listeners.  He could exhibit laurels.  They  were insignificant; still, in a district where laurels were infrequent,  they might shine.    He saw his gaping audience picturing him as the central figure in  blazing scenes.  And he imagined the consternation and the ejaculations  of his mother and the young lady at the seminary as they drank his  recitals.  Their vague feminine formula for beloved ones doing brave  deeds on the field of battle without risk of life would be destroyed.          Chapter 16      A sputtering of musketry was always to be heard.  Later, the cannon had  entered the dispute.  In the fog-filled air their voices made a  thudding sound.  The reverberations were continual.  This part of the  world led a strange, battleful existence.    The youth's regiment was marched to relieve a command that had lain  long in some damp trenches.  The men took positions behind a curving  line of rifle pits that had been turned up, like a large furrow, along  the line of woods.  Before them was a level stretch, peopled with  short, deformed stumps.  From the woods beyond came the dull popping of  the skirmishers and pickets, firing in the fog.  From the right came  the noise of a terrific fracas.    The men cuddled behind the small embankment and sat in easy attitudes  awaiting their turn.  Many had their backs to the firing.  The youth's  friend lay down, buried his face in his arms, and almost instantly, it  seemed, he was in a deep sleep.    The youth leaned his breast against the brown dirt and peered over  at  the woods and up and down the line.  Curtains of trees interfered with  his ways of vision.  He could see the low line of trenches but for a  short distance.  A few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills.  Behind them were rows of dark bodies with a few heads sticking  curiously over the top.    Always the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and  left, and the din on the right had grown to frightful proportions.  The  guns were roaring without an instant's pause for breath.  It seemed  that the cannon had come from all parts and were engaged in a  stupendous wrangle.  It became impossible to make a sentence heard.    The youth wished to launch a joke--a quotation from newspapers.  He  desired to say, \"All quiet on the Rappahannock,\" but the guns refused  to permit even a comment upon their uproar.  He never successfully  concluded the sentence.  But at last the guns stopped, and among the  men in the rifle pits rumors again flew, like birds, but they were now  for  the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily  near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope.  The men's  faces grew doleful from the interpreting of omens.  Tales of hesitation  and uncertainty on the part of those high in place and responsibility  came to their ears.  Stories of disaster were borne into their minds  with many proofs.  This din of musketry on the right, growing like a  released genie of sound, expressed and emphasized the army's plight.    The men were disheartened and began to mutter.  They made gestures  expressive of the sentence:  \"Ah, what more can we do?\" And it could  always be seen that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could  not fully comprehend a defeat.    Before the gray mists had been totally obliterated by the sun rays, the  regiment was marching in a spread column that was retiring carefully  through the woods.  The disordered, hurrying lines of the enemy could  sometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields.  They were  yelling, shrill and exultant.    At this sight the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly  enraged.  He exploded in loud sentences.  \"B'jiminey, we're generaled  by a lot 'a lunkheads.\"     \"More than one feller has said that t'-day,\" observed a man.    His friend, recently aroused, was still very drowsy.  He looked behind  him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement.  Then he  sighed.  \"Oh, well, I s'pose we got licked,\" he remarked sadly.    The youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely  condemn other men.  He made an attempt to restrain himself, but the  words upon his tongue were too bitter.  He presently began a long and  intricate denunciation of the commander of the forces.    \"Mebbe, it wa'n't all his fault--not all together.  He did th' best he  knowed.  It's our luck t' git licked often,\" said his friend in a weary  tone.  He was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes  like a man who has been caned and kicked.    \"Well, don't we fight like the devil?  Don't we do all that men can?\"  demanded the youth loudly.    He was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment when it came from his  lips.  For a moment his face lost its valor and he looked guiltily  about him.  But no one questioned his right to deal in such words, and  presently he recovered his air of courage.  He went on to repeat a  statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that  morning.  \"The brigadier said he never saw a new reg'ment fight the way  we fought yestirday, didn't he?  And we didn't do better than many  another reg'ment, did we?  Well, then, you can't say it's th' army's  fault, can you?\"    In his reply, the friend's voice was stern.  \"'A course not,\" he said.  \"No man dare say we don't fight like th' devil.  No man will ever dare  say it.  Th' boys fight like "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#18)"],[1,"Woman in the Cause of Woman's Eights,\" as she was called. In the  columns of \"The Free Inquirer,\" a newspaper which she and Robert Dale Owen  established and edited in New York City in 1829, she attacked religion in  every form, marriage, the family, and the State. She pretended to no basis  of scientific investigation, but in a brilliant flood of words endeavored  to sweep away faith in the Bible, the home, the Republic, in favor of  negation, communism, free love. I have place for but a single quotation  from one of her \"Fables,\" published in the \"Free Inquirer.\" It will show  the drift of her work in one direction:    \"'Is my errand sped, and am I a master on earth?' said the infernal king  (Pluto). 'Even as I promised,' said the Fury. 'Love hath forsaken the  earth. Under the form of religion I aroused the fears and commanded the  submission of mortals; and our imp now reigns on earth in the place of  Love, under the form of Hymen.' Pluto smiled grimly, and smote his thigh  in triumph. 'Well conceited, well executed, daughter of Night. Our empire  shall not lack recruits, now that innocence is exchanged for superstition,  and the true affection of congenial and confiding hearts is replaced by  mock ceremonies and compulsory oaths!'\"    Frances Wright had founded, in 1825, at Nashoba, Tennessee, a community  that had for its professed aim the elevation and education of the Southern  negroes. In describing her object, Miss Wright said: \"No difference will  be made in the schools between the white children and the children of  color, whether in education or in any other advantage. This establishment  is founded on the principle of community of property and labor: these  fellow-creatures, that is, the blacks, admitted here, requiting these  services by services equal or greater, by filling occupations which their  habits render easy, and which to their guides and assistants might be  difficult or unpleasing.\" This form of helotism flourished but three years  on American soil. It is doubly interesting as containing the germs of  communism and anti-slavery that blended themselves in the beginnings of a  movement for suffrage which was directly inspired by Frances Wright.    The editors of the \"Suffrage History\" say that \"above all other causes of  the suffrage movement, was the Anti-slavery struggle in this country.\"  They add: \"In the early Anti-slavery conventions, the broad principles of  human rights were so exhaustively discussed, justice, liberty, and  equality so clearly taught, that the women who crowded to listen, readily  learned the lesson of freedom for themselves, and early began to take part  in the debates and business affairs of all associations. And before the  public were aroused to the dangerous innovation, women were speaking in  crowded promiscuous assemblies. The clergy opposed to the Abolition  movement first took alarm, and issued a pastoral letter, warning their  congregations against the influence of such women. The clergy identified  with Anti-slavery associations took alarm also, and the initiative steps  to silence women, and to deprive them of the right to vote in the business  meetings, were soon taken. This action culminated in a division in the  Anti-slavery Association. The question of woman's right to speak, vote,  and serve on committee, not only precipitated the division in the ranks of  the American Anti-slavery society, in 1840, but it disturbed the peace of  the World's Anti-slavery Convention, held that same year in London. In  summoning the friends of the slave from all parts of the two hemispheres  to meet in London, John Bull never dreamed that woman, too, would answer  to his call. Imagine, then, the commotion in the conservative Anti-slavery  circles in England when it was known that half a dozen of those terrible  women who had spoken to promiscuous assemblies, voted on men and measures,  prayed and petitioned against slavery, women who had been mobbed,  ridiculed by the press, and denounced by the pulpit, who had been the  cause of setting all the American Abolitionists by the ears, and split  their ranks asunder, were on their way to England.\"    These quarrels, stirred up through the unseemly conduct of men and women,  as we have seen, they were willing to precipitate upon a convention in a  foreign land, a convention, too, which had declared its desire not to  receive them as delegates. Upon the calling of the roll, the meeting was  thrown into excitement and confusion on a subject foreign to that which  brought them together. Wendell Phillips eloquently pleaded for the  admission of the women. The English officers, while showing their personal  courtesy, begged to remind them that the Queen, and many ladies in various  stations, were represented by male delegates, and that to admit the  American ladies would be to cast a slight upon their own active members,  many of whom were present. During the heated discussion Mr. James Fuller  said: \"One friend has stated that this question should have been settled  on the other side of the Atlantic. Why, it _was_ so settled, and in favor  of the women.\" Mr. James G. Birney answered: \"The right of the women to  sit and act in all respects as men in our Anti-slavery associations was so  decided in the Society in May, 1839, but not by a large majority, which  majority was swelled by the votes of the women themselves. I have just  received a letter from a gentleman in New York (Lewis Tappan)  communicating the fact that the persistence of the friends of promiscuous  female representation in pressing that practice on the American Anti-  Slavery society, at its annual meeting on the 12th of last month, had  caused such disagreement that he, and others who viewed the subject as he  did, were deliberating the question of seceding from the old  organization.\"    Lewis Tappan, a founder of the American Missionary Society, was intimately  connected with his brother Arthur in all anti-slavery work. Arthur was a  founder of the American Tract Society, and of Oberlin College, and a  benefactor of Lane Seminary. He established \"The Emancipator,\" and was  president of the American Anti-Slavery Society until compelled, with his  brother Lewis, to withdraw on account of the conduct of the no-government  men and women, and take nearly all the Society with him.    When the vote was taken in the London meeting the women were excluded on  the ground that \"it being contrary to English usage, it would subject them  to ridicule and prejudice their cause.\"    George Thompson then said: \"I hope, as this question is now decided, that  Mr. Phillips will give us the assurance that we shall proceed with one  heart and one mind.\" Mr. Phillips replied, \"I have no doubt of it. There  is no unpleasant feeling on our part. All we asked was an expression of  opinion; we shall now act with the utmost cordiality.\"    But Mr. Phillips had reckoned without his host and hostesses. Mr. Garrison  had not been present at the discussion, but he arrived at this juncture  and took his seat with the excluded delegates. During a twelve-days'  discussion of the momentous cause that had called them together, which he  had professed especially to champion, he took not the slightest part. Such  was his mistaken zeal that he was willing so to stultify himself, and the  women were willing to applaud him in so doing. The spirit that looked upon  the American Constitution as \"a covenant with death and an agreement with  hell\" was there. The spirit that defied all authority and could confound  liberty of conscience with the formal acts of courtesy between man and  man, was there. The spirit that took for its motto \"You cannot shut up  discord\" was there. And out of these combined elements, trained in the  school of thought that had treated as tyranny the religious and civil  liberty of the United States, grew directly the Woman-Suffrage movement.  Elizabeth Cady Stanton was not a delegate. The delegates were Abby Kelly,  Esther Moore, and Lucretia Mott. Mrs. Stanton was a bride, and in the  immediate party on this, their wedding trip, was Mr. Birney, her husband's  special friend. The writers of the \"History\" say: \"As the ladies were not  allowed to speak in the Convention, they kept up a brisk fire, morning,  noon, and night, on the unfortunate gentlemen who were domiciled at the  same house.\" Mrs. Stanton had not been identified with any of these  abolition quarrels; but she records that now she took her full share of  the \"firing,\" notwithstanding her husband's \"gentle nudges under the  table\" and Mr. Birney's ominous frowns across it. In the volume entitled  \"Woman's Work in America,\" in a contribution called \"Woman in the State,\"  written by Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, she says: \"The leaders in the new  [suffrage] movement, Lucretia Mott and Mrs. Stanton, with their husbands,\"  did thus and so in originating it. Lucretia Mott's husband was with her as  a silent member of the conventions, but Elizabeth Cady Stanton's husband  is conspicuous for his absence from every list of officers or attendants,  from the inception of the Suffrage movement until his death. He may have  been in perfect sympathy with his wife; but since the names of all the men  already mentioned in connection with the mad \"no-civil, no-family, no-  personal government\" movement, do appear, and his does not, it is  impossible not to challenge Mrs. Livermore's statement. The last reference  to him in the \"History\" was as voting on the occasion of the London  meeting, in favor of the women's admission to the World's Convention. No  mention is made of any speech, or of reasons given. Certain it is, that  while Mr. Garrison became the conspicuous standard-bearer for the Woman's  Rights movement, Mr. Stanton became one of the conspicuous bearers of the  standard of the Free Soil and Republican parties, which included some of  Anti-slavery's staunchest friends, who were denounced by Garrison as its  foes.
