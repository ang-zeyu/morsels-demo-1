BRUNTON, MARY (BALFOUR) (1778-1818).--Novelist, _dau._ of Col. Balfour of  Elwick, and _m._ to the Rev. Dr. Brunton, Prof. of Oriental Languages in  the Univ. of Edin., was the authoress of two novels, _Self-Control_  (1811) and _Discipline_ (1814), which were popular in their day.      BRYANT, JACOB (1715-1804).--Scholar, _ed._ at Eton and Camb., wrote  learnedly, but paradoxically, on mythological and Homeric subjects. His  chief works were _A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology_  (1774-76), _Observations on the Plain of Troy_ (1795), and _Dissertation  concerning the Wars of Troy_ (1796). In the last two he endeavoured to  show that the existence of Troy and the Greek expedition were fabulous.  Though so sceptical on these points he was an implicit believer in the  authenticity of the Rowley authorship of Chatterton's fabrications. He  also wrote on theological subjects.      BRYANT, WILLIAM CULLEN (1794-1878).--Poet, was _b._ at Cummington,  Massachusetts, the _s._ of a doctor. His ancestors on both sides came  over in the _Mayflower_. His first poem was _Thanatopsis_ (1817), which  was greeted as the best poem produced in America up to that time. After  being a lawyer for some time he was induced to exchange law for  journalism, and acted as ed. of various periodicals. Among his best known  poems are _Lines to a Water-fowl_, _The Rivulet_, _The West Wind_, _The  Forest Hymn_, _The Fringed Gentian_, etc. His muse is tender and graceful,  pervaded by a contemplative melancholy, and a love of solitude and the  silence of the woods. Though he was brought up to admire Pope, and in his  early youth imitated him, he was one of the first American poets to throw  off his influence. He had a high sense of duty, was a prominent and  patriotic citizen, and enjoyed the esteem and even the reverence of his  fellow-countrymen. B. also produced a blank-verse translation of the  _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_.      BRYDGES, SIR SAMUEL EGERTON (1762-1837).--Bibliographer and genealogist,  _ed._ at Camb., was called to the Bar in 1787. He wrote some novels and  poems, now forgotten, but rendered valuable service by his  bibliographical publications, _Censura Literaria, Titles and Opinions of  Old English Books_ (10 vols. 1805-9), his editions of E. Phillips's  _Theatrum Poetarum Anglicanorum_ (1800) Collin's _Peerage of England_  (1812), and of many rare Elizabethan authors. He was made a baronet in  1814. He _d._ at Geneva.      BUCHANAN, GEORGE (1506-1582).--Historian and scholar _b._ at Killearn,  Stirlingshire, of poor parents, was sent in 1519, with the help of an  uncle, to the Univ. of Paris, where he first came in contact with the two  great influences of the age, the Renaissance and the Reformation. His  uncle having died, he had to leave Paris, and after seeing some military  service, returned to Scotland, and in 1524 went to St. Andrews, where he  studied under John Major (_q.v._). Two years later he found means to  return to Paris, where he graduated at the Scots Coll. in 1528, and  taught grammar in the Coll. of St. Barbe. Returning to Scotland in 1536  with a great reputation for learning he was made by James V. tutor to one  of his illegitimate sons, and incited by him to satirise the vices of the  clergy, which he did in two Latin poems, _Somnium_ and _Franciscanus_.  This stirred the wrath of the ecclesiastical powers to such a heat that,  the King withholding his protection, he was obliged in 1539 to save  himself by flight first to England and then to France, where he remained  until 1547 teaching Latin at Bordeaux and Paris. In the latter year he  was invited to become a prof. at Coimbra, where he was imprisoned by the  Inquisition as a heretic from 1549-51, and wrote the greater part of his  magnificent translation of the Psalms into Latin verse, which has never  been excelled by any modern. He returned to England in 1552, but soon  re-crossed to France and taught in the Coll. of Boncourt. In 1561 he came  back to his native country, where he remained for the rest of his life.  Hitherto, though a supporter of the new learning and a merciless exposer  of the vices of the clergy, he had remained in the ancient faith, but he  now openly joined the ranks of the Reformers. He held the Principalship  of St. Leonard's Coll., St. Andrews, was a supporter of the party of the  Regent Moray, produced in 1571 his famous _Detectio Mariae Reginae_, a  scathing exposure of the Queen's relations to Darnley and the  circumstances leading up to his death, was tutor, 1570-78, to James VI.,  whom he brought up with great strictness, and to whom he imparted the  learning of which the King was afterwards so vain. His chief remaining  works were _De Jure Regni apud Scotos_ (1579), against absolutism, and  his _History of Scotland_, which was _pub._ immediately before his death.  Though he had borne so great a part in the affairs of his country, and  was the first scholar of his age, he _d._ so poor that he left no funds  to meet the expenses of his interment. His literary masterpiece is his  _History_, which is remarkable for the power and richness of its style.  Its matter, however, gave so much offence that a proclamation was issued  calling in all copies of it, as well as of the _De Jure Regni_, that they  might be purged of the \"offensive and extraordinary matters\" which they  contained. B. holds his great and unique place in literature not so much  for his own writings as for his strong and lasting influence on  subsequent writers.      BUCHANAN, ROBERT (1841-1901).--Poet and novelist, _b._ at Caverswall,  Staffordshire, the _s._ of a Scottish schoolmaster and socialist, and  _ed._ at Glasgow, was the friend of David Gray (_q.v._), and with him  went to London in search of fame, but had a long period of  discouragement. His first work, a collection of poems, _Undertones_  (1863), had, however, some success, and was followed by _Idylls of  Inverburn_ (1865), _London Poems_ (1866), and others, which gave him a  growing reputation, and raised high hopes of his future. Thereafter he  took up prose fiction and the drama, not always with success, and got  into trouble owing to some drastic criticism of his contemporaries,  culminating in his famous article on the _Fleshly School of Poetry_,  which appeared in the _Contemporary Review_ (Oct. 1871), and evoked  replies from Rossetti (_The Stealthy School of Criticism_), and Swinburne  (_Under the Microscope_). Among his novels are _A Child of Nature_  (1879), _God and the Man_ (1881), and among his dramas _A Nine Days'  Queen_, _A Madcap Prince_, and _Alone in London_. His latest poems, _The  Outcast_ and _The Wandering Jew_, were directed against certain aspects  of Christianity. B. was unfortunate in his latter years; a speculation  turned out ruinously; he had to sell his copyrights, and he sustained a  paralytic seizure, from the effects of which he _d._ in a few months. He  ultimately admitted that his criticism of Rossetti was unjustifiable.      BUCKINGHAM, GEORGE VILLIERS, 2ND DUKE of (1628-1687).--Dramatist, _s._ of  the 1st Duke, who was in 1628 assassinated by Felton. His life was full  of adventure and change of fortune. The Restoration gave him back his  already twice lost estates, which he again squandered by a life of wild  extravagance and profligacy at Court. He was a member of the \"Cabal\" and  intrigued against Clarendon. He wrote pamphlets, lampoons, and plays, but  his chief contribution to literature was _The Rehearsal_, a comedy, in  which he satirised the heroic drama of Dryden and others. It is believed  that S. Butler had a hand in it. Dryden had his revenge in his picture of  B. as _Zimri_ in _Absalom and Achitophel_.      BUCKINGHAM AND NORMANBY, JOHN SHEFFIELD, 1ST DUKE of (1648-1721).--_S._  of the 2nd Earl of Mulgrave, served in his youth as a soldier under  Prince Rupert and Turenne, and is also said to have made love to the  Princess, afterwards Queen, Anne. He was a Privy Councillor under James  II., William and Mary, and Anne, with the last of whom he remained a  favourite. His magnificent mansion was purchased and pulled down to make  way for Buckingham Palace. He wrote _An Account of the Revolution_, _An  Essay on Satire_, and _An Essay on Poetry_. He also remodelled  Shakespeare's _Julius Caesar_.      BUCKINGHAM, JAMES SILK (1786-1855).--Journalist and traveller, wrote many  books of travel, both on the Old and New World. He established, and for a  year or two ed., _The Athenaeum_, and produced many pamphlets on political  and social subjects.      BUCKLAND, FRANCIS TREVELYAN (1826-80).--Naturalist, _b._ and _ed._ at  Oxf., where his _f._ was Dean of Christchurch. He studied medicine and  was assistant-surgeon in the Life Guards. An enthusiastic lover of  natural history, he wrote largely upon it, among his works being  _Curiosities of Natural History_ (4 vols. 1857-72), _Log Book of a  Fisherman and Zoologist_ (1876), _Natural History of British Fishes_  (1881). He also founded and ed. _Land and Water_. He was for a time  Inspector of Salmon Fisheries, and served on various commissions. Though  observant, he was not always strictly scientific in his methods and modes  of expression, and he was a strong opponent of Darwin.      BUCKLE, HENRY THOMAS (1821-1862).--Historical writer, _s._ of a wealthy  shipowner in London, was _b._ at Lee in Kent. Though never at a univ. and  little at school, he received a high degree of education privately, and  inheriting an ample fortune and a large library, he devoted himself to  travel and study, with the view of preparing for a great work which he  had projected, _The History of Civilisation in England_. As an  introduction to this he entered upon the consideration of the state of  civilisation in various other countries, but this he had scarcely  completed when his death took place at Damascus in 1862. The first vol.  was _pub._ "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#19)"],[1,"Nijnei Kolimsk now insisted on an instant return; but Sakalar was  firm, and, though their halt had given them little rest, started as  the sun was seen above the horizon. The road was fearfully bad. All  was rough, disjointed, and almost impassable. But the sledges had  good whalebone keels, and were made with great care to resist such  difficulties. The dogs were kept moving all day, but when night came  they had made but little progress. But they rested in peace. Nature  was calm, and morning found them still asleep. But Sakalar was  indefatigable, and as soon as he had boiled a potful of snow, made  tea, and awoke his people.    They were now about to enter a labyrinth of _toroses_ or icebergs.  There was no plain ground within sight; but no impediment could be  attended to. Bears made these their habitual resorts, while the wolf  skulked every night round the camp, waiting their scanty leavings.  Every eye was stretched in search of game. But the road itself  required intense care, to prevent the sledges overturning. Toward the  afternoon they entered a narrow valley of ice full of drifted snow,  into which the dogs sank, and could scarcely move. At this instant two  enormous white bears presented themselves. The dogs sprang forward;  but the ground was too heavy for them. The hunters, however, were  ready. The bears marched boldly on as if savage from long fasting.  No time was to be lost. Sakalar and Ivan singled out each his animal.  Their heavy ounce balls struck both. The opponent of Sakalar turned  and fled, but that of Ivan advanced furiously toward him. Ivan stood  his ground, axe in hand, and struck the animal a terrible blow on  the muzzle. But as he did so, he stumbled, and the bear was upon him.  Kolina shrieked; Sakalar was away after his prize; but the Kolimsk men  rushed in. Two fired: the third struck the animal with a spear. The  bear abandoned Ivan, and faced his new antagonists. The contest was  now unequal, and before half an hour was over, the stock of provisions  was again augmented, as well as the means of warmth. They had very  little wood, and what they had was used sparingly. Once or twice  a tree, fixed in the ice, gave them additional fuel; but they were  obliged chiefly to count on oil. A small fire was made at night to  cook by; but it was allowed to go out, the tent was carefully closed,  and the caloric of six people, with a huge lamp with three wicks,  served for the rest of the night.    About the sixth day they struck land. It was a small island, in a bay  of which they found plenty of drift wood. Sakalar was delighted. He  was on the right track. A joyous halt took place, a splendid fire was  made, and the whole party indulged themselves in a glass of rum--a  liquor very rarely touched, from its known tendency to increase rather  than diminish cold. A hole was next broken in the ice, and an attempt  made to catch some seals. Only one, however, rewarded their efforts;  but this, with a supply of wood, filled the empty space made in the  sledges by the daily consumption of the dogs. But the island was  soon found to be infested with bears: no fewer than five, with eleven  foxes, were killed, and then huge fires had to be kept up at night to  drive their survivors away.    Their provender thus notably increased, the party started in high  spirits; but though they were advancing toward the pole, they were  also advancing toward the Deep Sea, and the ice presented innumerable  dangers. Deep fissures, lakes, chasms, mountains, all lay in their  way; and no game presented itself to their anxious search. Day after  day they pushed on--here making long circuits, there driven back, and  losing sometimes in one day all they had made in the previous twelve  hours. Some fissures were crossed on bridges of ice, which took hours  to make, while every hour the cold seemed more intense. The sun was  now visible for hours, and, as usual in these parts, the cold was more  severe since his arrival.    At last, after more than twenty days of terrible fatigue, there was  seen looming in the distance what was no doubt the promised land. The  sledges were hurried forward--for they were drawing toward the end of  their provisions--and the whole party was at length collected on the  summit of a lofty mountain of ice. Before them were the hills of New  Siberia; to their right a prodigious open sea: and at their feet, as  far as the eye could reach, a narrow channel of rapid water, through  which huge lumps of ice rushed so furiously, as to have no time to  cement into a solid mass.    The adventurers stood aghast. But Sakalar led the way to the very  brink of the channel, and moved quietly along its course until he  found what he was in search of. This a sheet or floe of ice, large  enough to bear the whole party, and yet almost detached from the  general field. The sledges were put upon it, and then, by breaking  with their axes the narrow tongue which held it, it swayed away into  the tempestuous sea. It almost turned round as it started. The sledges  and dogs were placed in the middle, while the five men stood at the  very edge to guide it as far as possible with their hunting spears.    In a few minutes it was impelled along by the rapid current, but  received every now and then a check when it came in contact with  heavier and deeper masses. The Kolimsk men stood transfixed with  terror as they saw themselves borne out toward that vast deep sea  which eternally tosses and rages round the Arctic Pole: but Sakalar,  in a peremptory tone, bade them use their spears. They pushed away  heartily; and their strange raft, though not always keeping its  equilibrium, was edged away both across and down the stream. At last  it began to move more slowly, and Sakalar found himself under the  shelter of a huge iceberg, and then impelled up stream by a backwater  current. In a few minutes the much wished-for shore was reached.    The route was rude and rugged as they approached the land; but all  saw before them the end of their labors for the winter, and every one  proceeded vigorously. The dogs seemed to smell the land, or at all  events some tracks of game, for they hurried on with spirit. About  an hour before the usual time of camping they were under a vast  precipice, turning which, they found themselves in a deep and  sheltered valley, with a river at the bottom, frozen between its  lofty banks, and covered by deep snow.    \"The ivory mine!\" said Sakalar in a low tone to Ivan, who thanked him  by an expressive look.           *       *       *       *       *    THE RUSSIAN SERF.    \"In the Russian peasant lies the embryo of the Russian chivalric  spirit, the origin of our nation's grandeur.\"    \"Cunning fellows they are, the vagabonds,\" remarked Vassily  Ivanovitsch.    \"Yes, cunning, and thereby clever; quick in imitation, quick in  appropriating what is new or useful--ready prepared for civilization.  Try to teach a laborer in foreign countries anything out of the way  of his daily occupation, and he will still cling to his plow: with  us, only give the word, and the peasant becomes musician, painter,  mechanic, steward, anything you like.\"    \"Well, that's true,\" remarked Vassily Ivanovitsch.    \"And besides,\" continued Ivan Vassilievitsch, \"in what country can you  find such a strongly-marked and instinctive notion of his duties,  such readiness to assist his fellow-creatures, such cheerfulness, such  benignity, so much gentleness and strength combined.\"    \"A splendid fellow the Russian peasant--a splendid fellow indeed;\"  interrupted Vassily Ivanovitsch.    \"And, nevertheless, we disdain him, we look at him with contempt; nay,  more, instead of making any effort to cultivate his mind, we try to  spoil it by every possible means.\"    \"How so?\"    \"By the loathsome establishment we have--our household serfs. Our  house serf is the first step toward the tchinovnik. He goes without a  beard and wears a coat of a western cut; he is an idler, a debauchee,  a drunkard, a thief, and yet he assumes airs of consequence before  the peasant, whom he disdains, and from whose labor he draws his own  subsistence and his poll-tax. After some time more or less, according  to circumstances, the household serf becomes a clerk; he gets his  liberty and a place as writer in some district court; as a writer in  the government's service he disdains, in addition to the peasant, his  late comrades in the household; he learns to cavil in business, and  begins to take email bribes in poultry, eggs, corn, &c.; he studies  roguery systematically, and goes one step lower; he becomes a  secretary and a genuine tchinovnik. Then his sphere is enlarged; he  gets a new existence: he disdains the peasant, the house serf, the  clerk, and the writer, because, he says, they are all uncivilized  people. His wants are now greater, and you cannot bribe him except  with bank notes. Does he not take wine now at his meals? Does he not  patronize a little pharo? Is he not obliged to present his lady with  a costly cap or a silk gown? He fills up his place, and without the  least remorse--like a tradesman behind his counter--he sells his  influence as if it were merchandise. It happens now and then that he  is caught. 'Served him right,' say his comrades then; 'take bribes,  but take them prudently, so as not to be caught.'\"    \"But they are not all as you describe them,\" remarked Vassily  Ivanovitsch.    \"Certainly not. Exceptions, however, do not alter the rule.\"    \"And yet the officers in the government service with us are for the  most part elected by the nobility and gentry.\"    \"That is just where the great evil lies,\" continued Ivan  Vassilievitsch. \"What in other countries is an object of public  competition, is with us left to ourselves. What right have we to  complain against our government, who has left it in our discretion  to elect officers to regulate our internal affairs? Is it not our own  fault that, instead of"]]]
