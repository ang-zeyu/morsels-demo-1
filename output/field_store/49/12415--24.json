Whoever named that alcalde 'Law west of the Pecos' knew his man.\"    \"I'll bet a twist of dog,\" said Ramrod, \"that prisoner with the black  whiskers sabes English. Did you notice him paying strict attention to  Smoky's little talk? He reminds me of a fellow that crouched behind  his horse at the fight we had on the head of the Arroyo Colorado and  plugged me in the shoulder. What, you never heard of it? That's so,  Cushion hasn't been with us but a few months. Well, it was in '82,  down on the river, about fifty miles northwest of Brownsville. Word  came in one day that a big band of horse-thieves were sweeping the  country of every horse they could gather. There was a number of the  old Cortina's gang known to be still on the rustle. When this report  came, it found eleven men in camp. We lost little time saddling up,  only taking five days' rations with us, for they were certain to  recross the river before that time in case we failed to intercept  them. Every Mexican in the country was terrorized. All they could tell  us was that there was plenty of ladrones and lots of horses, 'muchos'  being the qualifying word as to the number of either.    \"It was night before we came to their trail, and to our surprise they  were heading inland, to the north. They must have had a contract to  supply the Mexican army with cavalry horses. They were simply sweeping  the country, taking nothing but gentle stock. These they bucked in  strings, and led. That made easy trailing, as each string left a  distinct trail. The moon was splendid that night, and we trailed as  easily as though it had been day. We didn't halt all night long on  either trail, pegging along at a steady gait, that would carry us  inland some distance before morning. Our scouts aroused every  ranch within miles that we passed on the way, only to have reports  exaggerated as usual. One thing we did learn that night, and that  was that the robbers were led by a white man. He was described in  the superlatives that the Spanish language possesses abundantly;  everything from the horse he rode to the solid braid on his sombrero  was described in the same strain. But that kind of prize was the kind  we were looking for.    \"On the head of the Arroyo Colorado there is a broken country  interspersed with glades and large openings. We felt very sure that  the robbers would make camp somewhere in that country. When day broke  the freshness of the trail surprised and pleased us. They couldn't be  far away. Before an hour passed, we noticed a smoke cloud hanging low  in the morning air about a mile ahead. We dismounted and securely tied  our horses and pack stock. Every man took all the cartridges he could  use, and was itching for the chance to use them. We left the trail,  and to conceal ourselves took to the brush or dry arroyos as a  protection against alarming the quarry. They were a quarter of a mile  off when we first sighted them. We began to think the reports were  right, for there seemed no end of horses, and at least twenty-five  men. By dropping back we could gain one of those dry arroyos which  would bring us within one hundred yards of their camp. A young fellow  by the name of Rusou, a crack shot, was acting captain in the absence  of our officers. As we backed into the arroyo he said to us, 'If  there's a white man there, leave him to me.' We were all satisfied  that he would be cared for properly at Rusou's hands, and silence gave  consent.    \"Opposite the camp we wormed out of the arroyo like a skirmish line,  hugging the ground for the one remaining little knoll between the  robbers and ourselves. I was within a few feet of Rusou as we sighted  the camp about seventy-five yards distant. We were trying to make out  a man that was asleep, at least he had his hat over his face, lying on  a blanket with his head in a saddle. We concluded he was a white man,  if there was one. Our survey of their camp was cut short by two shots  fired at us by two pickets of theirs posted to our left about one  hundred yards. No one was hit, but the sleeping man jumped to his feet  with a six-shooter in each hand. I heard Rusou say to himself, 'You're  too late, my friend.' His carbine spoke, and the fellow fell forward,  firing both guns into the ground at his feet as he went down.    \"Then the stuff was off and she opened up in earnest. They fought all  right. I was on my knee pumping lead for dear life, and as I threw my  carbine down to refill the magazine, a bullet struck it in the heel of  the magazine with sufficient force to knock me backward. I thought I  was hit for an instant, but it passed away in a moment. When I tried  to work the lever I saw that my carbine was ruined. I called to the  boys to notice a fellow with black whiskers who was shooting from  behind his horse. He would shoot over and under alternately. I  thought he was shooting at me. I threw down my carbine and drew my  six-shooter. Just then I got a plug in the shoulder, and things  got dizzy and dark. It caught me an inch above the nipple, ranging  upward,--shooting from under, you see. But some of the boys must have  noticed him, for he decorated the scene badly leaded, when it was  over. I was unconscious for a few minutes, and when I came around the  fight had ended.    \"During the few brief moments that I was knocked out, our boys had  closed in on them and mixed it with them at short range. The thieves  took to such horses as they could lay their hands on, and one fellow  went no farther. A six-shooter halted him at fifty yards. The boys  rounded up over a hundred horses, each one with a fiber grass halter  on, besides killing over twenty wounded ones to put them out of their  misery.    \"It was a nasty fight. Two of our own boys were killed and three were  wounded. But then you ought to have seen the other fellows; we took no  prisoners that day. Nine men lay dead. Horses were dead and dying all  around, and the wounded ones were crying in agony.    \"This white man proved to be a typical dandy, a queer leader for such  a gang. He was dressed in buckskin throughout, while his sombrero was  as fine as money could buy. You can know it was a fine one, for it  was sold for company prize money, and brought three hundred and fifty  dollars. He had nearly four thousand dollars on his person and in his  saddle. A belt which we found on him had eleven hundred in bills and  six hundred in good old yellow gold. The silver in the saddle was  mixed, Mexican and American about equally.    \"He had as fine a gold watch in his pocket as you ever saw, while his  firearms and saddle were beauties. He was a dandy all right, and a  fine-looking man, over six feet tall, with swarthy complexion and hair  like a raven's wing. He was too nice a man for the company he was in.  We looked the 'Black Book' over afterward for any description of  him. At that time there were over four thousand criminals and outlaws  described in it, but there was no description that would fit him.  For this reason we supposed that he must live far in the interior of  Mexico.    \"Our saddle stock was brought up, and our wounded were bandaged as  best they could be. My wound was the worst, so they concluded to send  me back. One of the boys went with me, and we made a fifty-mile ride  before we got medical attention. While I was in the hospital I got my  divvy of the prize money, something over four hundred dollars.\"    When Ramrod had finished his narrative, he was compelled to submit to  a cross-examination at the hands of Cushion-foot, for he delighted  in a skirmish. All his questions being satisfactorily answered,  Cushion-foot drew up his saddle alongside of where Ramrod lay  stretched on a blanket, and seated himself. This was a signal to the  rest of us that he had a story, so we drew near, for he spoke so low  that you must be near to hear him. His years on the frontier were rich  in experience, though he seldom referred to them.    Addressing himself to Ramrod, he began: \"You might live amongst these  border Mexicans all your life and think you knew them; but every day  you live you'll see new features about them. You can't calculate  on them with any certainty. What they ought to do by any system of  reasoning they never do. They will steal an article and then give it  away. You've heard the expression 'robbing Peter to pay Paul.' Well,  my brother played the role of Paul once himself. It was out in Arizona  at a place called Las Palomas. He was a stripling of a boy, but could  palaver Spanish in a manner that would make a Mexican ashamed of his  ancestry. He was about eighteen at this time and was working in a  store. One morning as he stepped outside the store, where he slept,  he noticed quite a commotion over around the custom-house. He noticed  that the town was full of strangers, as he crossed over toward the  crowd. He was suddenly halted and searched by a group of strange men.  Fortunately he had no arms on him, and his ability to talk to them,  together with his boyish looks, ingratiated him in their favor, and  they simply made him their prisoner. Just at that moment an alcalde  rode up to the group about him, and was ordered to halt. He saw at a  glance they were revolutionists, and whirling his mount attempted to  escape, when one of them shot him from his horse. The young fellow  then saw what he was into.    \"They called themselves Timochis. They belonged in Mexico, and a year  or so before they refused to pay taxes that the Mexican government  levied on them, and rebelled. Their own government sent soldiers after  them, resulting in about eight hundred soldiers being killed, when  they dispersed into small bands, one of which was paying Las Palomas a  social call that morning. Along the Rio Grande it is only a short  step at best from revolution to robbery, and either calling has its  variations.    \"Well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#19)"],[1,"removd her to Fairfeild it left her, & since yt hath not been disturbd  in like manner.\"    \"The aboue testimony of Daniell Wesocott now read to the wife of sayd  Daniell Shee testifys to the whole verbatum & hath now giuen oath to the  same before us in Standford, Septembr 12th 1692.    \"JONATN SELLECK Comissr    \"JONOTHAN BELL Commissionr.    \"Sworn in Court Septr 15 1692    \"As attests John Allyn Secry.\"    ABIGAIL WESCOT--_Throwing stones--Railing--Twitting of \"fine cloths\"_    \"Abigal Wescot further saith that as she was going along the street  Goody Clauson came out to her and they had some words together and Goody  Clauson took up stone and threw at her; and at another time as she went  along the street before said Clausons dore Goody Clauson caled to me and  asked me what I did in my chamber last Sabbath day night, and I doe  affirme that I was not their that night; and at another time as I was in  her sone Stephens house being neer her one house shee followed me in and  contended with me becase I did not com into her house caling of me proud  slut what ear you proud on your fine cloths and you look to be mistres  but you never shal by me and seuerall other prouoking speeches at that  time and at another time as I was by her house she contended and  quareled with me; and we had many words together and shee twited me of  my fine cloths and of my mufe and also contended with me several other  times.    \"Taken upon oath before us Standford Septemr 12th  \"JONATN SELLECK Comissionr  \"JONOTHAN BELL Comissr.\"    ABRAHAM FINCH--_The strange light--\"Two pry eies\"--Cause of the \"pricking\"_    \"Abraham Finch jun aged about 26 years.    \"The deponant saith that hee being a waching at with ye French girle at  Daniell Wescoat house in the night I being laid on the bed the girle  fell into a fite and fell crose my feet and then I looking up I sawe a  light abut the bignes of my too hands glance along the sommer of the  house to the harth ward, and afterwards I sawe it noe mor; and when  Dauid Selleck brought a light into the room a littell space after the  French garle cam to hirselfe againe.
