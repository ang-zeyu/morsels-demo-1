But the serpent  escaped death by the will of fate, and in a rage bit the Brahman's son  with its sharp fangs, and he fell down dead at once. His people raised  him a funeral pyre not far from the field and burnt him to ashes.    [Illustration:]    Two days afterwards his father came back, and when he learnt his son's  fate he grieved and mourned. But after a time, he took the bowl of  milk, went to the ant-hill, and praised the serpent with a loud voice.  After a long, long time the serpent appeared, but only with its head  out of the opening of the ant-hill, and spoke to the Brahman: \"'Tis  greed that brings you here, and makes you even forget the loss of  your son. From this time forward friendship between us is impossible.  Your son struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have bitten him to  death. How can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can you  forget the pain and grief at the loss of your son?\" So speaking, it  gave the Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared. But before it went  away it said: \"Come back no more.\" The Brahman took the pearl, and  went back home, cursing the folly of his son.          The Son of Seven Queens      Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens, but no  children. This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered  that on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.    Now it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King, and  said, \"Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and  one of your seven Queens shall bear a son.\"    The King's delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders  for appropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event  throughout the length and breadth of the land.    Meanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace,  attended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts'  content on sweetmeats and confectionery.    Now the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started,  the seven Queens sent him a message saying, \"May it please our dearest  lord not to hunt towards the north to-day, for we have dreamt bad  dreams, and fear lest evil should befall you.\"    [Illustration:]    The King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes,  and set out towards the south; but as luck would have it, although he  hunted diligently, he found no game. Nor had he more success to the  east or west, so that, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to  go home empty-handed, he forgot all about his promise, and turned to  the north. Here also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had  made up his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden  horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket. So quickly did  it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless a burning desire to  capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast.  He instantly ordered his attendants to form a ring round the thicket,  and so encircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he  pressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in  the midst. Nearer and nearer he advanced, till, just as he thought to  lay hold of the beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound,  leapt clean over the King's head, and fled towards the mountains.  Forgetful of all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed  at full speed. On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue far behind,  keeping the white hind in view, never drawing bridle, until, finding  himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in his steed.  Before him stood a miserable hovel, into which, being tired after his  long, unsuccessful chase, he entered to ask for a drink of water. An  old woman, seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request  by calling to her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came a  maiden so lovely and charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired,  that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a  sight in the wretched hovel.    She held the vessel of water to the King's lips, and as he drank he  looked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl  was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet  he had chased so far.    Her beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to  return with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven  Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage. However, when he  would take no refusal, but implored her to have pity on him, promising  her everything she could desire, she replied, \"Give me the eyes of  your seven Queens, and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you  say.\"    The King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind's  magical beauty, that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven  Queens taken out, and, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a  noisome dungeon whence they could not escape, set off once more for  the hovel in the ravine, bearing with him his horrible offering. But  the white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes,  and threading them as a necklace, flung it round her mother's neck,  saying, \"Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, whilst I am away in  the King's palace.\"    Then she went back with the bewitched monarch, as his bride, and he  gave her the seven Queens' rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven  Queens' palace to live in, and the seven Queens' slaves to wait upon  her; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire.    Now, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes  torn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest  of the Queens. It was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very  jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate. But  though at first they disliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved  so useful to them, that ere long they all looked on him as their son.  Almost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud  wall of their dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had  made a hole big enough for him to crawl through. Through this he  disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats, which  he divided equally amongst the seven blind Queens.    As he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three  times every day to play with the little nobles in the town. No one  knew who the tiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full  of funny tricks and antics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to  be rewarded by some girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some  sweetmeats. All these things he brought home to his seven mothers, as  he loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on in  their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death  ages before.    At last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his bow and  arrow, and went out to seek for game. Coming by chance past the palace  where the white hind lived in wicked splendour and magnificence, he  saw some pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets, and,  taking good aim, shot one dead. It came tumbling past the very window  where the white Queen was sitting; she rose to see what was the  matter, and looked out. At the first glance of the handsome young lad  standing there bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that it was the  King's son.    She nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy the lad  without delay; therefore, sending a servant to bring him to her  presence, she asked him if he would sell her the pigeon he had just  shot.    \"No,\" replied the sturdy lad, \"the pigeon is for my seven blind  mothers, who live in the noisome dungeon, and who would die if I did  not bring them food.\"    \"Poor souls!\" cried the cunning white witch; \"would you not like to  bring them their eyes again? Give me the pigeon, my dear, and I  faithfully promise to show you where to find them.\"    Hearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and gave up the  pigeon at once. Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother  without delay, and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.    \"She will not fail to give them,\" said the cruel Queen, \"if you show  her this token on which I have written what I want done.\"    So saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with these  words inscribed on it--\"Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his  blood like water!\"    Now, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took the fatal  message cheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen's mother.    Whilst he was journeying he passed through a town, where every one of  the inhabitants looked so sad, that he could not help asking what was  the matter. They told him it was because the King's only daughter  refused to marry; so when her father died there would be no heir to  the throne. They greatly feared she must be out of her mind, for  though every good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown to  her, she declared she would only marry one who was the son of seven  mothers, and who ever heard of such a thing? The King, in despair, had  ordered every man who entered the city gates to be led before the  Princess; so, much to the lad's impatience, for he was in an immense  hurry to find his mothers' eyes, he was dragged into the  presence-chamber.    No sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed, and,  turning to the King, said, \"Dear father, this is my choice!\"    Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.    [Illustration: THE SON OF SEVEN MOTHERS]    The inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven  Queens said he would not marry the Princess unless they first let him  recover his mothers' eyes. When the beautiful bride heard his story,  she asked to see the potsherd, for she was very learned and clever.  Seeing the treacherous words,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"would forsake the banners of England for those of France.  Richard  met the bribe by another, and promised four pieces to every French  knight who should join the Lion of England. In this unworthy rivalry  their time was wasted, to the great detriment of the discipline and  efficiency of their followers. Some good was nevertheless effected; for  the mere presence of two such armies prevented the besieged city from  receiving supplies, and the inhabitants were reduced by famine to the  most woeful straits. Saladin did not deem it prudent to risk a general  engagement by coming to their relief, but preferred to wait till  dissension had weakened his enemy, and made him an easy prey. Perhaps  if he had been aware of the real extent of the extremity in Acre, he  would have changed his plan; but, cut off from the town, he did not  know their misery till it was too late. After a short truce the city  capitulated upon terms so severe that Saladin afterwards refused to  ratify them. The chief conditions were, that the precious wood of the  true cross, captured by the Moslems in Jerusalem, should be restored;  that a sum of two hundred thousand gold pieces should be paid; and that  all the Christian prisoners in Acre should be released, together with  two hundred knights and a thousand soldiers, detained in captivity by  Saladin. The eastern monarch, as may be well conceived, did not set  much store on the wood of the cross, but was nevertheless anxious to  keep it, as he knew its possession by the Christians would do more than  a victory to restore their courage. He refused, therefore, to deliver  it up, or to accede to any of the conditions; and Richard, as he had  previously threatened, barbarously ordered all the Saracen prisoners in  his power to be put to death.    The possession of the city only caused new and unhappy dissensions  between the Christian leaders. The Archduke of Austria unjustifiably  hoisted his flag on one of the towers of Acre, which Richard no sooner  saw than he tore it down with his own hands, and trampled it under his  feet. Philip, though he did not sympathise with the Archduke, was  piqued at the assumption of Richard, and the breach between the two  monarchs became wider than ever. A foolish dispute arose at the same  time between Guy of Lusignan and Conrad of Montferrat for the crown of  Jerusalem. The inferior knights were not slow to imitate the pernicious  example, and jealousy, distrust, and ill-will reigned in the Christian  camp. In the midst of this confusion the King of France suddenly  announced his intention to return to his own country. Richard was  filled with indignation, and exclaimed, \"Eternal shame light on him,  and on all France, if, for any cause, he leave this work unfinished!\"  But Philip was not to be stayed. His health had suffered by his  residence in the East, and, ambitious of playing a first part, he  preferred to play none at all, than to play second to King Richard.  Leaving a small detachment of Burgundians behind, he returned to France  with the remainder of his army; and Coeur de Lion, without feeling, in  the multitude of his rivals, that he had lost the greatest, became  painfully convinced that the right arm of the enterprize was lopped off.    After his departure, Richard re-fortified Acre, restored the Christian  worship in the churches, and, leaving a Christian garrison to protect  it, marched along the sea-coast towards Ascalon. Saladin was on the  alert, and sent his light horse to attack the rear of the Christian  army, while he himself, miscalculating their weakness since the  defection of Philip, endeavoured to force them to a general engagement.  The rival armies met near Azotus. A fierce battle ensued, in which  Saladin was defeated and put to flight, and the road to Jerusalem left  free for the crusaders.    Again discord exerted its baleful influence, and prevented Richard from  following up his victory. His opinion was constantly opposed by the  other leaders, all jealous of his bravery and influence; and the army,  instead of marching to Jerusalem, or even to Ascalon, as was first  intended, proceeded to Jaffa, and remained in idleness until Saladin  was again in a condition to wage war against them.    Many months were spent in fruitless hostilities and as fruitless  negotiations. Richard's wish was to recapture Jerusalem; but there were  difficulties in the way, which even his bold spirit could not conquer.  His own intolerable pride was not the least cause of the evil; for it  estranged many a generous spirit, who would have been willing to  co-operate with him in all cordiality. At length it was agreed to march  to the Holy City; but the progress made was so slow and painful, that  the soldiers murmured, and the leaders meditated retreat. The weather  was hot and dry, and there was little water to be procured. Saladin had  choked up the wells and cisterns on the route, and the army had not  zeal enough to push forward amid such privation.  At Bethlehem a  council was held, to debate whether they should retreat or advance.  Retreat was decided upon, and immediately commenced. It is said, that  Richard was first led to a hill, whence he could obtain a sight of the  towers of Jerusalem, and that he was so affected at being so near it,  and so unable to relieve it, that he hid his face behind his shield,  and sobbed aloud.    The army separated into two divisions, the smaller falling back upon  Jaffa, and the larger, commanded by Richard and the Duke of Burgundy,  returning to Acre. Before the English monarch had made all his  preparations for his return to Europe, a messenger reached Acre with  the intelligence that Jaffa was besieged by Saladin, and that, unless  relieved immediately, the city would be taken. The French, under the  Duke of Burgundy, were so wearied with the war, that they refused to  aid their brethren in Jaffa. Richard, blushing with shame at their  pusillanimity, called his English to the rescue, and arrived just in  time to save the city. His very name put the Saracens to flight, so  great was their dread of his prowess. Saladin regarded him with the  warmest admiration, and when Richard, after his victory, demanded  peace, willingly acceded. A truce was concluded for three years and  eight months, during which Christian pilgrims were to enjoy the liberty  of visiting Jerusalem without hindrance or payment of any tax. The  crusaders were allowed to retain the cities of Tyre and Jaffa, with the  country intervening. Saladin, with a princely generosity, invited many  of the Christians to visit Jerusalem; and several of the leaders took  advantage of his offer to feast their eyes upon a spot which all  considered so sacred. Many of them were entertained for days in the  Sultan's own palace, from which they returned with their tongues laden  with the praises of the noble infidel. Richard and Saladin never met,  though the impression that they did will remain on many minds, who have  been dazzled by the glorious fiction of Sir Walter Scott. But each  admired the prowess and nobleness of soul of his rival, and agreed to  terms far less onerous than either would have accepted, had this mutual  admiration not existed.[Richard left a high reputation in Palestine. So  much terror did his name occasion, that the women of Syria used it to  frighten their children for ages afterwards. Every disobedient brat  became still when told that King Richard was coming. Even men shared  the panic that his name created; and a hundred years afterwards,  whenever a horse shied at any object in the way, his rider would  exclaim, \"What! dost thou think King Richard is in the bush?\"]    The King of England no longer delayed his departure, for messengers  from his own country brought imperative news that his presence was  required to defeat the intrigues that were fomenting against his crown.  His long imprisonment in the Austrian dominions and final ransom are  too well known to be dwelt upon. And thus ended the third Crusade, less  destructive of human life than the two first, but quite as useless.    The flame of popular enthusiasm now burned pale indeed, and all the  efforts of popes and potentates were insufficient to rekindle it.  At  last, after flickering unsteadily, like a lamp expiring in the socket,  it burned up brightly for one final instant, and was extinguished for  ever.    The fourth Crusade, as connected with popular feeling, requires little  or no notice. At the death of Saladin, which happened a year after the  conclusion of his truce with Richard of England, his vast empire fell  to pieces. His brother Saif Eddin, or Saphaddin, seized upon Syria, in  the possession of which he was troubled by the sons of Saladin. When  this intelligence reached Europe, the Pope, Celestine III. judged the  moment favourable for preaching a new Crusade. But every nation in  Europe was unwilling and cold towards it. The people had no ardour, and  Kings were occupied with more weighty matters at home. The only Monarch  of Europe who encouraged it was the Emperor Henry of Germany, under  whose auspices the Dukes of Saxony and Bavaria took the field at the  head of a considerable force. They landed in Palestine, and found  anything but a welcome from the Christian inhabitants. Under the mild  sway of Saladin, they had enjoyed repose and toleration, and both were  endangered by the arrival of the Germans. They looked upon them in  consequence as over-officious intruders, and gave them no encouragement  in the warfare against Saphaddin. The result of this Crusade was even  more disastrous than the last--for the Germans contrived not only to  embitter the Saracens against the Christians of Judea, but to lose the  strong city of Jaffa, and cause the destruction of nine-tenths of the  army with which they had quitted Europe. And so ended the fourth  Crusade.    The fifth was more important, and had a result which its projectors  never dreamed of--n"]]]
