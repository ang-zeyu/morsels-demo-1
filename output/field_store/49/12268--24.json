I have had frequent opportunities of observing the young, from one to  three days old, of the Cervus campestris--the common deer of the pampas,  and the perfection of its instincts at that tender age seem very  wonderful in a ruminant. When the doe with, fawn is approached by a  horseman, even when accompanied with dogs, she stands perfectly  motionless, gazing fixedly at the enemy, the fawn motionless at her  side; and suddenly, as if at a preconcerted signal, the fawn rushes  directly away from her at its utmost speed; and going to a distance of  six hundred to a thousand yards conceals itself in a hollow in the  ground or among the long grass, lying down very close with neck  stretched out horizontally, and will thus remain until sought by the  dam. When very young if found in its hiding-place it will allow itself  to be taken, making no further effort to escape. After the fawn has run  away the doe still maintains her statuesque attitude, as if resolved to  await the onset, and only when the dogs are close to her she also rushes  away, but invariably in a direction as nearly opposite to that taken by  the fawn as possible. At first she runs slowly, with a limping gait, and  frequently pausing, as if to entice her enemies on, like a partridge,  duck or plover when driven from its young; but as they begin to press  her more closely her speed increases, becoming greater the further she  succeeds in leading them from the starting-point.    The alarm-cry of this deer is a peculiar whistling bark, a low but  far-reaching sound; but when approaching a doe with young I have never  been able to hear it, nor have I seen any movement on the part of the  doe. Yet it is clear that in some mysterious way she inspires the fawn  with sudden violent fear; while the fawn, on its side, instead of being  affected like the young in other mammals, and sticking closer to its  mother, acts in a contrary way, and runs from her.    Of the birds I am acquainted with, the beautiful jacana (Parra jacana)  appears to come into the world with its faculties and powers in the most  advanced state. It is, in fact, ready to begin active life from the very  moment of leaving the shell, as I once accidentally observed. I found a  nest on a small mound of earth in a shallow lagoon, containing four  eggs, with the shells already chipped by the birds in them. Two yards  from the small nest mound there was a second mound covered with coarse  grass. I got off my horse to examine the nest, and the old birds,  excited beyond measure, fluttered round me close by pouring out their  shrill rapidly-reiterated cries in an unbroken stream, sounding very  much like a policeman's rattle. While I was looking closely at one of  the eggs lying on the palm of my hand, all at once the cracked shell  parted, and at the same moment the young bird leaped from my hand and  fell into the water. I am quite sure that the young bird's sudden escape  from the shell and my hand was the result of a violent effort on its  part to free itself; and it was doubtless inspired to make the effort by  the loud persistent screaming of the parent birds, which it heard while  in the shell. Stooping to pick it up to save it from perishing, I soon  saw that my assistance was not required, for immediately on dropping  into the water, it put out its neck, and with the body nearly submerged,  like a wounded duck trying to escape observation, it swam rapidly to the  second small mound I have mentioned, and, escaping from the water,  concealed itself in the grass, lying close and perfectly motionless like  a young plover.    In the case of the pampa or creolla sheep, I have shown that during its  long, rough life in La Plata, this variety has in some measure recovered  the natural vigour and ability to maintain existence in adverse  circumstances of its wild ancestors. As much can be said of the creolla  fowl of the pampas; and some observations of mine on the habits of this  variety will perhaps serve to throw light on a vexed question of Natural  History--namely, the cackling of the hen after laying, an instinct which  has been described as \"useless\" and \"disadvantageous.\" In fowls that  live unconfined, and which are allowed to lay where they like, the  instinct, as we know it, is certainly detrimental, since egg-eating dogs  and pigs soon learn the cause of the outcry, and acquire a habit of  rushing off to find the egg when they hear it. The question then arises:  Does the wild jungle fowl possess the same pernicious instinct?    The creolla is no doubt the descendant of the fowl originally introduced  about three centuries ago by the first colonists in La Plata, and has  probably not only been uncrossed with any other improved variety, such  as are now fast taking its place, and has lived a much freer life than  is usual with the fowl in Europe. It is a rather small, lean, extremely  active bird, lays about a dozen eggs, and hatches them all, and is of a  yellowish red colour--a hue which is common, I believe, in the old  barn-door fowl of England. The creolla fowl is strong on the wing, and  much more carnivorous and rapacious in habits than other breeds; mice,  frogs, and small snakes are eagerly hunted and devoured by it. At my  home on the pampas a number of these fowls were kept, and were allowed  to range freely about the plantation, which was large, and the adjacent  grounds, where there were thickets of giant cardoon thistle, red-weed,  thorn apple, &c. They always nested at a distance from the house, and it  was almost impossible ever to find their eggs, on account of the extreme  circumspection they observed in going to and from their nests; and when  they succeeded in escaping foxes, skunks, weasels, and opossums, which,  strange to say, they often did, they would rear their chickens away out  of sight and hearing of the house, and only bring them home when winter  deprived them of their leafy covering and made food scarce. During the  summer, in my rambles about the plantation, T would occasionally  surprise one of these half-wild hens with her brood; her distracted  screams and motions would then cause her chicks to scatter and vanish in  all directions, and, until the supposed danger was past, they would lie  as close and well-concealed as young partridges. These fowls in summer  always lived in small parties, each party composed of one cock and as  many hens as he could collect--usually three or four. Each family  occupied its own feeding ground, where it would pass a greater portion  of each day. The hen would nest at a considerable distance from the  feeding ground, sometimes as far as four or five hundred yards away.  After laying an egg she would quit the nest, not walking from it as  other fowls do, but flying, the flight extending to a distance of from  fifteen to about fifty yards; after which, still keeping silence, she  would walk or run, until, arrived at the feeding ground, she would begin  to cackle. At once the cock, if within hearing, would utter a responsive  cackle, whereupon she would run to him and cackle no more. Frequently  the cackling call-note would not be uttered more than two or three  times, sometimes only once, and in a much lower tone than in fowls of  other breeds.    If we may assume that these fowls, in their long, semi-independent  existence in La Plata, have reverted to the original instincts of the  wild Gallus bankiva, we can see here how advantageous the cackling  instinct must be in enabling the hen in dense tropical jungles to rejoin  the flock after laying an egg. If there are egg-eating animals in the  jungle intelligent enough to discover the meaning of such a short,  subdued cackling call, they would still be unable to find the nest by  going back on the bird's scent, since she flies from the nest in the  first place; and the wild bird probably flies further than the creolla  hen of La Plata. The clamorous cackling of our fowls would appear then  to be nothing more than a perversion of a very useful instinct.          CHAPTER VII.    THE MEPHITIC SKUNK.      It might possibly give the reader some faint conception of the odious  character of this creature (for adjectives are weak to describo it) when  I say that, in talking to strangers from abroad, I have never thought it  necessary to speak of sunstroke, jaguars, or the assassin's knife, but  have never omitted to warn them of the skunk, minutely describing its  habits and personal appearance.    I knew an Englishman who, on taking a first gallop across the pampas,  saw one, and, quickly dismounting, hurled himself bodily on to it to  effect its capture. Poor man! he did not know that the little animal is  never unwilling to be caught. Men have been blinded for ever by a  discharge of the fiery liquid full in their faces. On a mucous membrane  it burns like sulphuric acid, say the unfortunates who have had the  experience. How does nature protect the skunk itself from the injurious  effects of its potent fluid? I have not unfrequently found individuals  stone-blind, sometimes moving so briskly about that the blindness must  have been of long standing--very possibly in some cases an accidental  drop discharged by the animal itself has caused the loss of sight. When  coming to close quarters with a skunk, by covering up the face, one's  clothes only are ruined. But this is not all one has to fear from an  encounter; the worst is that effluvium, after which crushed garlic is  lavender, which tortures the olfactory nerves, and appears to pervade  the whole system like a pestilent ether, nauseating one until  sea-sickness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#18)"],[1," very  efficient and economical governor, maintaining a reputation for probity  that did not distinguish too many of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic  generals. Flinders, just in his opinion even of an enemy, wrote to Sir  Joseph Banks that Decaen bore among the people of the island \"the  character of having a good heart, though too hasty and violent.\" It is  pleasant to find him writing thus of the man who had wronged him, at a  time when he had good reason for feeling bitter; and we certainly need  not think worse of Decaen than did the man who suffered most from the  general's callous insensibility.    Now, the clear facts with regard to the taking from Flinders of his  charts, papers, log-books, and journals are these. On December 17, the  day after his arrival at the island, it was signified to him that the  governor intended to detain him. All his charts and journals relating to  the voyage, and the letters and official packets which he was carrying to  England from Sydney, were put in a trunk, which was sealed by Flinders at  the desire of the French officers who were sent by Decaen to arrest him.  He signed a paper certifying that all the \"charts, journals, and papers  of the voyage\" had been thus placed in the trunk.* (* Flinders, Voyage 2  361.) On the following day (Sunday, December 18) he was informed that the  governor wished to have extracts made from his journals, showing the  causes which had compelled him to quit the Investigator, for which ship  and for no other, according to Decaen's contention, the passport had been  granted. He also wished to elicit from the journals evidence of the  reasons which had induced Flinders to stop at Mauritius, instead of  sailing for the Cape of Good Hope. The officers explained that General  Decaen considered it to be necessary to have these extracts for  transmission to the French Government, \"to justify himself for granting  that assistance to the Cumberland which had been ordered for the  Investigator.\" So far he had not, as a fact, granted any assistance to  the Cumberland; for the imprisonment of her commander and crew can hardly  be called \"assistance.\" But as Flinders was convinced that an examination  of his latest log-book would manifest his bona fides, and assure both the  governor and the French Government that he was no spy, as Decaen accused  him of being, he broke the seal of the trunk, and took out \"the third  volume of my rough log-book, which contained the whole of what they  desired to know, and pointing out the parts in question to the secretary,  told him to make such extracts as should be thought requisite.\"* (*  Flinders, Voyage 2 364.) All the other papers and books were at once  returned to the trunk, and sealed as before.    The third log-book was the only document pertaining to Flinders'  discoveries which Decaen ever had in his possession. It was never  returned. The rightful owner never saw it again. It has never since been  produced. Flinders applied for it repeatedly. On the very day before he  was liberated, he made a final demand for it. Mr. Hope, the British  commissary for the exchange of prisoners, made a formal official  application for it in 1810, but met with \"a positive refusal both of the  book and of permission to take a copy of it.\"* (* Hope's report to the  Admiralty, October 25, 1810 (Historical Records of New South Wales 7  435).) In 1811, after Flinders reached England, the Admiralty, at his  instance, requested the French Government to insist upon its restoration.  At the end of his book, published 1814, Flinders earnestly protested  against Decaen's continued detention of it. But it was not restored.    This book contained Flinders' \"Journal of transactions and observations  on board the Investigator, the Porpoise, the Hope cutter, and Cumberland  schooner,\" for the preceding six months.* (* Flinders, Voyage 2 378 and  463.) There was therefore nothing in it which could have been of any use  in relation to the so-called Terre Napoleon. The log-book embodying  Flinders' observations on those coasts pertained to a period before the  six months just mentioned, and was never seen by Decaen, nor did he see  any of Flinders' charts whatever.    Towards the end of December the whole of the remaining books and papers  of Flinders, even including his family letters, were, in his presence,  collected from the ship by M. Bonnefoy, an interpreter, and Colonel  Monistrol, Decaen's secretary--who \"acted throughout with much  politeness, apologising for what they were obliged by their orders to  execute\"--and sealed up in another trunk.* (* Ibid 2 367.) Later in the  same month (December 26), Flinders, wishing to occupy his time in  confinement by proceeding with his work, wrote to the governor,  requesting that he might have his printed volumes, and two or three  charts and manuscript books, for the purpose of finishing his chart of  the Gulf of Carpentaria, adding in explanation that some of his papers  were lost in the wreck of the Porpoise, and he wished to finish the work  from memory, with the aid of the remaining materials, before the details  faded from his recollection. Decaen acceded to his request, and Flinders  took out two log-books, such charts as were necessary, all his private  letters, and his journals of bearings and astronomical observations. He  also took out his naval signal-book, which he destroyed, lest it should  be seen by any French officer. He gave a receipt for the documents, and  the remainder were once more locked up in the trunk, which was again  sealed by Flinders.* (* Voyage 2 378.) The papers so obtained were the  \"greatest part\"* (* Flinders, letter to Governor King, August 1804, and  letter to Banks, July 12. Historical Records of New South Wales 4 411 and  396.) of his books and charts, and the possession of them, enabling  Flinders to devote his energies to the work he loved, relieved the  depression which imprisonment and illness cast upon his active brain and  body.    In February of the following year Flinders made another application for  more books and papers, consisting of the greater part of his \"original  fair charts,\"* (* Voyage 2 384.) for the purpose of making an abridgment  of his discoveries upon a single sheet. The governor was by this time  very angry with his captive; the more so, probably, as he was conscious  of the inadequacy of the reasons for detaining him. But the demeanour of  the English captain did not please him either. Flinders, maintaining the  dignity of his uniform, had not assumed a humble mien, and had even  refused an invitation to dine with the general unless he could attend,  not as a prisoner, but as an officer free and unsuspect. If Decaen really  believed him to be a spy, why did he invite him? The governor, however,  was not now in a mood to oblige his prisoner, and in response to his  application for more papers, curtly replied that he would attend to the  request when freed from more pressing business. Flinders in March urged  Colonel Monistrol to intercede; complained in May that the manuscripts  were still withheld; and, being unable to make any impression on the  obdurate Decaen, completed his map with the aid of another journal kept  by Mr. Akin, the master of the Investigator, who was a fellow-prisoner  until May 1805.    These remaining documents were not restored till August 1807, when  Flinders was invited to go to Port Louis from the house in the country  where part of his imprisonment was spent, and take possession of the  trunk. He found that rats had eaten their way into it, and had made great  havoc among his papers, totally destroying some. But the seals were  unbroken, and Flinders gave a receipt for the contents, acknowledging  that the most important documents had happily escaped the rats.* (*  Voyage 2 462.) He was an observant man, and if he had had any suspicion  that the charts had been tampered with, would have promptly said so.  There is not, however, the faintest reason for believing that the trunk  had been opened between December 1803, when Flinders was permitted to  take out the \"greatest part\" of his important papers, and August 1807,  when the remainder were restored to him. The only missing documents were  the few which the rats had eaten, the third log-book, which Decaen  refused to give up, and two packets of official despatches which the  Cumberland was carrying from Sydney to England, and which Colonel  Monistrol informed him had been \"long ago disposed of.\" The Colonel  \"supposed that something in them had contributed to my imprisonment.\"  They had been \"disposed of\" by being sent to Paris for the perusal of  Napoleon's Government.    Why, however, did Decaen refuse permission to Flinders to have the last  of his papers till the year 1807? Why had he willingly permitted him to  take some of them in December 1803, but declined to let him have any more  till nearly four years later? A comparison of dates is instructive on  this point. As has already been said, the first volume of Peron's Voyage  de Decouvertes aux Terres Australes, and the first edition of the atlas  containing two of Freycinet's charts, were published in 1807. Making all  allowances for the obstinate character of Decaen, it is most significant  that the remainder of Flinders' charts and papers were kept from him  until the very time when Freycinet was ready to publish the first and  hurried edition of his atlas. It is impossible to resist the conclusion  that the governor was acting under influences exerted from Paris, private  if not official, in refusing the navigator access to the material which  it was believed was essential to the completion of the charts that would  demonstrate his discoveries, until the French officer could hurry out a  makeshift atlas and fictitious claims could be based upon it.    This conduct was reprehensible enough, but, it must be insisted, there is  no ground whatever for the too frequently made assertion that"]]]
