And so it was as I have set down, there were Monsters without in the  Night that did torment me; having, it may be, intent to lure me unto  destruction; or indeed it doth chance that they had no hope but to  plague me with malice.    And, as may be thought, all this considering of my trouble, and the  giving of my strength unto Naani through the night of the world, that  she might have comfort and help, did work upon me; so that I grew thin,  plainly to the eye of those that loved me.    And the Master Monstruwacan, he that did love me, as I were his son,  chid me gently, and had wise speech with me; so that I but loved him the  more, yet without having gain of health; for my heart destroyed me, as  it doth if love be held back and made always to weep.    And it may be thought strange that my Mother and my Father did not talk  also with me; but I had neither Mother nor Father those many years; and  this thing I should have set down early; so that none should waste  thought pondering to no end. But the blame is to my telling.    Now, concerning my love-trouble, there did happen a certain thing which  gave me to decide; for one night I waked from a sore troubled sleep, and  it did seem that Naani did call my name, mine olden love name, and in a  voice of utter anguish and with beseeching. And I sat up in the bed, and  sent the Master-Word into the Night, with my brain-elements; and  presently all about me there was the solemn beat of the Master-Word,  answering; but weak, and gone faint, that scarce I might hear it.    And I called again with my brain-elements unto Naani, that was Mirdath;  and spoke to give her assurance, and to haste to tell unto me that which  was so wrong and pitiful with her. And who shall be amazed that I was  shaken with the eagerness of my spirit, in that it was so long since  Naani had spoken clear within my soul; and now behold, her voice.    Yet, though I did call many a time unto the everlasting night, there  came no more the voice of Naani, speaking strangely within my spirit;  but only at times a weak thrilling of the aether about me.    And, at the last I grew maddened with the sorrow of this thing, and the  sense and knowledge of harm about the maid; and I stood upright upon my  feet, and I raised my hands, and gave word and honour unto Naani through  all the blackness of the night, that I would no more abide within the  Mighty Pyramid to my safety, whilst she, that had been mine Own through  Eternity, came to horror and destruction by the Beasts and Evil Powers  of that Dark World. And I gave the word with my brain-elements, and bade  her to be of heart; for that until I died I would seek her. But out of  the Darkness there came naught but the silence.    Then I clothed me swiftly, and went up quickly to the Tower of  Observation, that I might speak instant with the Master Monstruwacan;  for my heart burned in me to intention, and to be doing speedily that  which I had set upon myself to do.    And I came to the Master Monstruwacan, and told all to him; and how that  I did mean no more to suffer in quiet and to no end; but to make  adventure into the Night Land, that I find Naani, or perchance find a  swift peace from this my long troubling.    Now, when the Master Monstruwacan heard that which I had to say, it sat  heavily upon him, and he besought me long and many times that I refrain  from this thing; for that none might achieve so great a task; but that I  should be lost in my Youth before many days were gone by. Yet to all his  speech I said naught, save that this thing was laid upon me, and even as  I had promised, so should I make to act.    And in the ending, the Master Monstruwacan perceived that I was set to  this thing, and not to be moved; and he did put it to me how that I had  grown to leanness, with so much troubling, and that I should have wisdom  to wait awhile, that I put on my full strength.    But even as I was, so would I go; and this I told to him, gently; and  showed how that the thing was meet and helpful to the safety of my soul;  for that my strength was still in me; yet was I sweeter in spirit  because that I stood lean and pure, and much poor dross and littleness  had been burned from me; so that fear was not in me. And all do I lay to  the count of my love, which doth purify and make sweet and fearless the  human heart.    And because I was even as I have said, so was I the less in trouble of  the Forces of Evil; for long and sore had been my Preparation of Spirit;  and I wot that none had ever gone forth into the Darkness, so long  withholden from that which doth weaken and taint the spirit.    And here let me set down how that the Three Days of Preparation, which  were Proper to those that willed to go forth into the Night Land, had  for their chief aim the cleansing of the spirit; so that the Powers of  Evil did have a less ableness to harm.    But also it was, as I have said, that none should go forth in ignorance  of the full dreadfulness of all that held the Night; for it was at the  Preparation that there was made known certain horrors that were not told  unto the young; and of horrid mutilations, and of abasements of the  soul, that did shake the heart with fear, if but they were whispered  into the hearing. And these things were not set down in any book that  might be lightly come by; but were warded and safe locked by the Master  of The Preparation, in the Room of Preparation.    And, indeed, when I did hear that which presently I was to hear, I had  wonder in my heart that ever any went out into the Night Land; or that  ever the Room of Preparation should have other than Students that meant  not to go forth, but only to achieve some knowledge of that which hath  been done, and mayhaps shall be once again.    Yet, in verity, is this but the way of the human heart; and hath always  been, and will be so in all the years, for ever. For to adventure is the  lust of Youth; and to leave Safety is the natural waywardness of the  spirit; and who shall reprove or regret; for it were sorrowful that this  Spirit of Man should cease. Yet must it not be thought that I do uphold  fightings to the death or to mutilation, _between man and man_; but  rather do sorrow upon this thought.    Now, when the morrow came, if thus I shall speak of that which was  outwardly even as the night, though changing alway within the Mighty  Pyramid, I went unto the Room of Preparation; and the Door was closed  upon me; and I underwent the Full Preparation; that I might have full  power and aid to come to success through all the terror of the Night  Land.    And three days and three nights did I abide within the Room of  Preparation; and upon the fourth day was mine armour brought unto me;  and the Master of the Preparation stood away from me, silent and with  sorrow upon his face; but touching me not, neither coming anigh to aid  me; nor having any speech with me; for none might crowd upon me, or  cause me to answer.    And, presently, was I clad with the grey armour; and below the armour a  close-knit suit of special shaping and texture, to have the shape of the  armour, and that I might not die by the cold of the Night Land. And I  placed upon me a scrip of food and drink, that might keep the life  within me for a great time, by reason of its preparation; and this lay  ready to me, with the armour, and was stitched about with the Mark of  Honour; so that I knew loving women thus to speed me.    And when all was done and made ready, I took up the Diskos, and bowed in  silence to the Master of the Preparation; and he went towards the door,  and opened it; and signalled that the People stand back; so that I might  go forth untouched. And the People stood back; for many had crowded to  the door of the Room of Preparation, so that I knew how that my story  must be to the heart of all, in all the Cities of the Great Redoubt; for  to come unbidden anigh that Door was against the Lesser Law, and that  any erred in this matter, betokened much.    And I went out through the Door; and there was a mighty lane of people  unto the Great Lift. And about the Great Lift, as I went downwards, did  the countless millions stand; and all in a great silence; but having  dear sympathy in their souls; yet loyal unto my safety, in that none in  all the Mighty Pyramid did make speech unto me, or call out aught. And  as I went downward through the miles, lo! all the aether of the world  seemed to be surged with the silent prayers and speedings of those quiet  multitudes.    And I came at last unto the Great Gate; and behold the dear Master  Monstruwacan did stand in full armour, and with the Diskos, to do me  honour, with the Full Watch, as I went forth. And I looked at him,  quietly, and he looked unto me, and I bent my head to show respect; and  he made silent salute with the Diskos; and afterwards I went onwards  towards the Great Gateway.    And they made dim the lights in the Great Causeway, that there should no  glare go forth into the Land, when the Gate was opened; and behold, they  opened not the lesser gate within the greater, for me; but did honour my  journey, in that they swung wide the Great Gate itself, through which a  monstrous army might pass. And there was an utter silence all about the  Gate; and in the hushed light the two thousand that made the Full Watch,  held up each the Diskos, silently, to make salute; and humbly, I held up  the Diskos reversed, and went forward into the Dark.          VI    THE WAY THAT I DID GO      Now I went forward for a space, and took heed not to look backwards; but  to be strong of heart and spirit; for that which did lie before me had  need of all my manhood and courage of soul,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden.

[_Upas_. l. 238. There is a poison-tree in the island of Java, which is  said by its effluvia to have depopulated the country for 12 or 14 miles  round the place of its growth. It is called, in the Malayan language,  Bohon-Upas; with the juice of it the most poisonous arrows are prepared;  and, to gain this, the condemned criminals are sent to the tree with  proper direction both to get the juice and to secure themselves from the  malignant exhalations of the tree; and are pardoned if they bring back a  certain quantity of the poison. But by the registers there kept, not  one in four are said to return. Not only animals of all kinds, both  quadrupeds, fish, and birds, but all kinds of vegetables also are  destroyed by the effluvia of the noxious tree; so that, in a district of  12 or 14 miles round it, the face of the earth is quite barren and rocky,  intermixed only with the skeletons of men and animals; affording a scene  of melancholy beyond what poets have described or painters delineated.  Two younger trees of its own species are said to grow near it. See  London Magazine for 1784, or 1783.

With blushes bright as morn fair ORCHIS charms,  260  And lulls her infant in her fondling arms;      [_Orchis_. l. 259. The Orchis morio in the circumstance of the  parent-root shrivelling up and dying, as the young one increases, is  not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots, but also to some  bulbous roots, as the tulip. The manner of the production of herbaceous  plants from their various perennial roots, seems to want further  investigation, as their analogy is not yet clearly established. The  caudex, or true root, in the orchis lies above the knob; and from this  part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced. In the tulip the  caudex lies below the bulb; from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the  new bulbs; and I suspect the tulip-root, after it has flowered, dies  like the orchis-root; for the stem of the last year's tulip lies on the  outside, and not in the center of the new bulb; which I am informed does  not happen in the three or four first years when raised from seed, when  it only produces a stem, and slender leaves without flowering. In the  tulip-root, dissected in the early spring, just before it begins to  shoot, a perfect flower is seen in its center; and between the first and  second coat the large next year's bulb is, I believe, produced; between  the second and third coat, and between this and the fourth coat, and  perhaps further, other less and less bulbs are visible, all adjoining  to the caudex at the bottom of the mother-bulb; and which, I am told,  require as many years before they will slower, as the number of the coats  with which they are covered. This annual reproduction of the tulip-root  induces some florists to believe that tulip-roots never die naturally, as  they lose so few of them; whereas the hyacinth-roots, I am informed, will  not last above five or seven years after they have flowered.    The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root, as the stem of the last  year's flower is always found in the center of the root, and the new  off-sets arise from the caudex below the bulb, but not beneath any of the  concentric coats of the root, except the external one: hence Mr. Eaton,  an ingenious florist of Derby, to whom I am indebted for most of the  observations in this note, concludes, that the hyacinth-root does not  perish annually after it has flowered like the tulip. Mr. Eaton gave me a  tulip root which had been set too deep in the earth, and the caudex had  elongated itself near an inch, and the new bulb was formed above the old  one, and detached from it, instead of adhering to its side.    The caudex of the ranunculus, cultivated by the florists, lies above the  claw-like root; in this the old root or claws die annually, like the  tulip and orchis, and the new claws, which are seen above the old ones,  draw down the caudex lower into the earth. The same is said to happen to  Scabiosa, or Devil's bit, and some other plants, as valerian and greater  plantain; the new fibrous roots rising round the caudex above the old  ones, the inferior end of the root becomes stumped, as if cut off, after  the old fibres are decayed, and the caudex is drawn down into the earth  by these new roots.
