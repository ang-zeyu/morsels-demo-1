An interesting example of a reflex influence from the nose      affecting the genital sphere has been brought forward by Dr. E.S.      Talbot, of Chicago: \"A 56-year-old man was operated on      (September 1, 1903) for the removal of the left cartilage of the      septum of the nose owing to a previous traumatic fracture at the      sixteenth year. No pain was experienced until two years ago, when      a continual soreness occurred at the apical end of the fracture      during the winter months. The operation was decided upon fearing      more serious complications. The parts were cocainized. No pain      was experienced in the operation except at one point at the lower      posterior portion near the floor of the nose. A profound shock to      the general system followed. The reflex influence of the pain      upon the genital organs caused semen to flow continually for      three weeks. Treatment of general motor irritability with camphor      monobromate and conium, on consultation with Dr. Kiernan, checked      the flow. The discharge produced spinal neurasthenia. The legs      and feet felt heavy. Erythromelalgia caused uneasiness. The      patient walked with difficulty. The tired feeling in the feet and      limbs was quite noticeable four months after the operation,      although the pain had, to a great extent diminished.\" (Chicago      Academy of Medicine, January, 1904, and private letter.)        J.N. Mackenzie has brought together a great many original      observations, together with interesting quotations from old      medical literature, in his two papers: \"The Pathological Nasal      Reflex\" (_New York Medical Journal_, August 20, 1887) and \"The      Physiological and Pathological Relations between the Nose and the      Sexual Apparatus of Man\" (_Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin_,      January 1, 1898). A number of cases have also been brought      together from the literature by G. Endriss in his Inaugural      Dissertation, _Die bisherigen Beobachtungen von Physiologischen      und Pathologischen Beziehungen der oberen Luftwege zu den      Sexualorganen_, Teil. II, Wuerzburg, 1892.    The intimate association between the sexual centers and the olfactory  tract is well illustrated by the fact that this primitive and ancient  association tends to come to the surface in insanity. It is recognized by  many alienists that insanity of a sexual character is specially liable to  be associated with hallucinations of smell.        Many eminent alienists in various countries are very decidedly of      the opinion that there is a special tendency to the association      of olfactory hallucinations with sexual manifestations, and,      although one or two authorities have expressed doubt on the      matter, the available evidence clearly indicates such an      association. Hallucinations of smell are comparatively rare as      compared to hallucinations of sight and hearing; they are      commoner in women than in men and they not infrequently occur at      periods of sexual disturbance, at adolescence, in puerperal      fever, at the change of life, in women with ovarian troubles, and      in old people troubled with sexual desires or remorse for such      desires. They have often been noted as specially frequent in      cases of excessive masturbation.        Krafft-Ebing, who found olfactory hallucinations common in      various sexual states, considers that they are directly dependent      on sexual excitement (_Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie_,      bd. 34, ht. 4, 1877). Conolly Norman believes in a distinct and      frequent association between olfactory hallucinations and sexual      disturbance (_Journal of Mental Science_, July, 1899, p. 532).      Savage is also impressed by the close association between sexual      disturbance or changes in the reproductive organs and      hallucinations of smell as well as of touch. He has found that      persistent hallucinations of smell disappeared when a diseased      ovary was removed, although the patient remained insane. He      considers that such hallucinations of smell are allied to      reversions. (G.H. Savage, \"Smell, Hallucinations of,\" Tuke's      _Dictionary of Psychological Medicine_; cf. the same author's      manual of _Insanity and Allied Neuroses_.) Matusch, while not      finding olfactory hallucinations common at the climacteric,      states that when they are present they are connected with uterine      trouble and sexual craving. He finds them more common in young      women. (Matusch, \"Der Einfluss des Climacterium auf Entstchung      und Form der Geistesstoerung,\" _Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer      Psychiatrie_, vol. xlvi, ht. 4). Fere has related a significant      case of a young man in whom hallucinations of smell accompanied      the sexual orgasm; he subsequently developed epilepsy, to which      the hallucination then constituted the aura (_Comptes Rendus de      la Societe de Biologie_, December, 1896). The prevalence of a      sexual element in olfactory hallucinations has been investigated      by Bullen, who examined into 95 cases of hallucinations of smell      among the patients in several asylums. (In a few cases there were      reasons for believing that peripheral conditions existed which      would render these hallucinations more strictly illusions.) Of      these, 64 were women. Sixteen of the women were climacteric      cases, and 3 of them had sexual hallucinations or delusions.      Fourteen other women (chiefly cases of chronic delusional      insanity) had sexual delusions. Altogether, 31 men and women had      sexual delusions. This is a large proportion. Bullen is not,      however, inclined to admit any direct connection between the      reproductive system and the sense of smell. He finds that other      hallucinations are very frequently associated with the olfactory      hallucinations, and considers that the co-existence of olfactory      and sexual troubles simply indicates a very deep and widespread      nervous disturbance. (F. St. John Bullen, \"Olfactory      Hallucinations in the Insane,\" _Journal of Mental Science_, July,      1899.) In order to elucidate the matter fully we require further      precise inquiries on the lines Bullen has laid down.        It may be of interest to note, in this connection, that smell and      taste hallucinations appear to be specially frequent in forms of      religious insanity. Thus, Dr. Zurcher, in her inaugural      dissertation on Joan of Arc (_Jeanne d'Arc_, Leipzig, 1895, p.      72), estimates that on the average in such insanity nearly 50 per      cent, of the hallucinations affect smell and taste; she refers      also to the olfactory hallucinations of great religious leaders,      Francis of Assisi, Katherina Emmerich, Lazzaretti, and the      Anabaptists.    It may well be, as Zwaardemaker has suggested in his _Physiologie des  Geruchs_, that the nasal congestion at menstruation and similar phenomena  are connected with that association of smell and sexuality which is  observable throughout the whole animal world, and that the congestion  brings about a temporary increase of olfactory sensitiveness during the  stage of sexual excitation.[43] Careful investigation of olfactory  acuteness would reveal the existence of such menstrual heightening of its  acuity.    In a few exceptional, but still quite healthy people, smell would appear  to possess an emotional predominance which it cannot be said to possess in  the average person. These exceptional people are of what Binet in his  study of sexual fetichism calls olfactive type; such persons form a group  which, though of smaller size and less importance, is fairly comparable to  the well-known groups of visual type, of auditory type, and of psychomotor  type. Such people would be more attentive to odors, more moved by  olfactory sympathies and antipathies, than are ordinary people. For these,  it may well be, the supremacy accorded to olfactory influences in Jaeger's  _Entdeckung der Seele_, though extravagantly incorrect for ordinary  persons, may appear quite reasonable.    It is certain also that a great many neurasthenic people, and  particularly those who are sexually neurasthenic, are peculiarly  susceptible to olfactory influences. A number of eminent poets and  novelists--especially, it would appear, in France--seem to be in this  case. Baudelaire, of all great poets, has most persistently and most  elaborately emphasized the imaginative and emotional significance of odor;  the _Fleurs du Mal_ and many of the _Petits Poemes en Prose_ are, from  this point of view, of great interest. There can be no doubt that in  Baudelaire's own imaginative and emotional life the sense of smell played  a highly important part; and that, in his own words, odor was to him what  music is to others. Throughout Zola's novels--and perhaps more especially  in _La Faute de l'Abbe Mouret_--there is an extreme insistence on odors of  every kind. Prof. Leopold Bernard wrote an elaborate study of this aspect  of Zola's work[44]; he believed that underlying Zola's interest in odors  there was an abnormally keen olfactory sensibility and large development  of the olfactory region of the brain. Such a supposition is, however,  unnecessary, and, as a matter of fact, a careful examination of Zola's  olfactory sensibility, conducted by M. Passy, showed that it was somewhat  below normal.[45] At the same time it was shown that Zola was really a  person of olfactory psychic type, with a special attention to odors and a  special memory for them; as is frequently the case with perfumers with  less than normal olfactory acuity he possessed a more than normal power of  discriminating odors; it is possible that in early life his olfactory  acuity may also have been above normal. In the same way Nietzsche, in his  writings,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#19)"],[1,"he was 10 a nursery governess, to      gratify her own desires, placed his finger in her vagina; in      adult life he developed urolagnic tendencies.        In a case of Moll's the development of a youthful admiration for      the nates in a coprolagnic direction may be clearly traced. In      this case a young man, a merchant, in a good position, sought to      come in contact with women defecating; and with this object would      seek to conceal himself in closets; the excretal odor was      pleasurable to him, but was not essential to gratification, and      the sight of the nates was also exciting and at the same time not      essential to gratification; the act of defecation appears,      however, to have been regarded as essential. He never sought to      witness prostitutes in this situation; he was only attracted to      young, pretty and innocent women. The coprolagnia here, however,      had its source in a childish impression of admiration for the      nates. When 5 or 6 years old he crawled under the clothes of a      servant girl, his face coming in contact with her nates, an      impression that remained associated in his mind with pleasure.      Three or four years later he used to experience much pleasure      when a young girl cousin sat on his face; thus was strengthened      an association which developed naturally into coprolagnia. (Moll,      _Untersuchungen ueber die Libido Sexualis_, bd. i, p. 837.)        It is scarcely necessary to remark that an admiration for the      nates, even when reaching a fetichistic degree, by no means      necessarily involves, even after many years, any attraction to      the excreta. A correspondent for whom the nates have constituted      a fetich for many years writes: \"I find my craving for women with      profuse pelvic or posterior development is growing and I wish to      copulate from behind; but I would feel a sickening feeling if any      part of my person came in contact with the female anus. It is      more pleasing to me to see the nates than the mons, yet I loathe      everything associated with the anal region.\"    Moll has recorded in detail a case of what may be described as \"ideal  coprolagnia\"--that is to say, where the symbolism, though fully developed  in imagination, was not carried into real life--which is of great interest  because it shows how, in a very intelligent subject, the deviated  symbolism may become highly developed and irradiate all the views of life  in the same way as the normal impulse. (The subject's desires were also  inverted, but from the present point of view the psychological interest of  the case is not thereby impaired.) Moll's case was one of symbolism of  act, the excreta offering no attraction apart from the process of  defecation. In a case which has been communicated to me there was, on the  other hand, an olfactory fetichistic attraction to the excreta even in the  absence of the person.        In Moll's case, the patient, X., 23 years of age, belongs to a      family which he himself describes as nervous. His mother, who is      anaemic, has long suffered from almost periodical attacks of      excitement, weakness, syncope and palpitation. A brother of the      mother died in a lunatic asylum, and several other brothers      complain much of their nerves. The mother's sisters are very      good-natured, but liable to break out in furious passions; this      they inherit from their father. There appears to be no nervous      disease on the patient's father's side. X.'s sisters are also      healthy.        X. himself is of powerful undersized build and enjoys good      health, injured by no excesses. He considers himself nervous. He      worked hard at school and was always the first in his class; he      adds, however, that this is due less to his own abilities than      the laziness of his school-fellows. He is, as he remarks, very      religious and prays frequently, but seldom goes to church.        In regard to his psychic characters he says that he has no      specially prominent talent, but is much interested in languages,      mathematics, physics and philosophy, in fact, in abstract      subjects generally. \"While I take a lively interest in every kind      of intellectual work,\" he says, \"it is only recently that I have      been attracted to real life and its requirements. I have never      had much skill in physical exercises. For external things until      recently I have only had contempt. I have a delicately      constituted nature, loving solitude, and only associating with a      few select persons. I have a decided taste for fiction, poetry      and music; my temperament is idealistic and religious, with      strict conceptions of duty and morality, and aspirations towards      the good and beautiful. I detest all that is common and coarse,      and yet I can think and act in the way you will learn from the      following pages.\"        Regarding his sexual life, X. made the following communication:      \"During the last two years I have become convinced of the      perversion of my sexual instinct. I had often previously thought      that in me the impulse was not quite normal, but it is only      lately that I have become convinced of my complete perversion. I      have never read or heard of any case in which the sexual feelings      were of the same kind. Although I can feel a lively inclination      towards superior representatives of the female sex, and have      twice felt something like love, the sight or the recollection      even of a beautiful woman have never caused sexual excitement.\"      In the two exceptional instances mentioned it appears that X. had      an inclination to kiss the women in question, but that the      thought of coitus had no attraction. \"In my voluptuous dreams,      connected with the emission of semen, women in seductive      situations have never appeared. I have never had any desire to      visit a _puella publica_. The love-stories of my fellow-students      seemed very silly, dances and balls were a horror to me, and only      on very rare occasions could I be persuaded to go into society.      It will be easy to guess the diagnosis in my case: I suffer from      the sexual attraction of my own sex, I am a lover of boys.        \"You cannot imagine what a world of thoughts, wishes, feelings      and impulses the words 'knabe,' 'pais,' 'garcon,' 'boy,'      'ragazzo' have for me; one of these words, even in an unmeaning      clause of a translation-book, calls before me the whole sum of      associations which in course of time have become bound up with      this idea, and it is only with an effort that I can scare away      the wild band. This group of thoughts shows a wonderful mixture      of warm sensuality and ideal love, it unites my lowest and      highest impulses, the strength and the weakness of my nature, my      curse and my blessing. My inclination is especially towards boys      of the age of 12 to 15; though they may be rather younger or      older. That I should prefer beautiful and intelligent boys is      comprehensible. I do not want a prostitute, but a friend or a      son, whose soul I love, whom I can help to become a more perfect      man, such as I myself would willingly be.        \"When I myself belonged to that happy age (i.e., below 15) I had      no dearer wish than to possess a friend of similar tastes. I have      sought, hoped, waited, grieved, and been at last disillusioned,      overcome by desire and despair, and have not found that friend.      Even later the hope often reappeared, but always in vain, and I      cannot boast of that sure recognition which one reads of in the      autobiographies of Urnings. I do not know personally a single      fellow-sufferer. It is also doubtful whether such an      acquaintanceship would greatly help me, for I have a very      peculiar conception of homosexuality. As you will see, I have      little more in common with what are called paederasts than sexual      indifference to the female sex, and I often ask myself: 'Does any      other man in the whole world feel like you? Are you alone in the      earth with your morbid desires? Are you a pariah of pariahs, or      is there, perhaps, another soul with similar longings living near      you? How often in summer have I gone to the lakes and streams      outside cities to seek boys bathing; but I always came back      unsatisfied, whether I found any or not. And in winter I have      been irresistibly impelled to return to the same spots, as if it      were sanctified by the boys, but my darlings had vanished and      cold winds blew over the icy floods, so that I would return      feeling as though I had buried all my happiness.        \"It must be borne in mind, therefore, that what I have to say      regarding my sexual impulses only refers to fancies and never to      their practical realization. My sensual impulses are not      connected with the sexual organs; all my voluptuous ideas are not      in the least connected with these parts. For this reason I have      never practiced onanism and _immissio membri in anum_ is as      repulsive to me as to a normal man. Even every imitation of      coitus is, for me, without attraction. In a boy's body two things      specially excite me: _his belly and his nates_, the first as      containing the digestive tract, the second as holding the opening      of the bowels. Of the vegetable processes of life in the boy none      interest me nearly so much as the progress of his digestion and      the process of defecation. It is incredible to what an extent      this part of physiology has occupied me from youth. If as a boy I      wanted to read something of a piquantly exciting character I      sought in my father's encyclopaedia for articles like:      Obstruction, Constipation, Haemorrhoids, Faeces, etc. No function      of the body seemed to be so significant as this, and I"]]]
