All life is short, with thee the  dance and song. Man cannot be satisfied with wealth, we could  obtain wealth, as long as we did not reach you we live only as  long as thou pleasest. The boon which I choose I have said.\"  Yama said, \"One thing is good, another is pleasant. Blessed is  he who takes the good, but he who chooses the pleasant loses  the object of man. But thou considering the objects of desire,  hast abandoned them. These two, ignorance (whose object is    60    what is pleasant) and knowledge (whose object is what is good),  are known to be far asunder, and to lead to different goals.  Believing that this world exists and not the other, the careless  youth is subject to my sway. That knowledge which thou hast  asked is not to be obtained by argument. I know worldly happiness  is transient for that firm one is not to be obtained by what  is not firm. The wise by concentrating on the soul, knowing him  whom it is hard to behold, leaves both grief and joy. Thee  O Naciketas, I believe to be like a house whose door is open to  Brahman. Brahman is deathless, whoever knows him obtains  whatever he wishes. The wise man is not born; he does not die;  he is not produced from anywhere. Unborn, eternal, the soul is  not slain, though the body is slain; subtler than what is subtle,  greater than what is great, sitting it goes far, lying it goes everywhere.  Thinking the soul as unbodily among bodies, firm among  fleeting things, the wise man casts off all grief. The soul cannot  be gained by eloquence, by understanding, or by learning. It  can be obtained by him alone whom it chooses. To him it reveals  its own nature [Footnote ref 1].\" So long as the Self identifies itself  with its desires, he wills and acts according to them and reaps the  fruits in the present and in future lives. But when he comes to know the  highest truth about himself, that he is the highest essence and principle  of the universe, the immortal and the infinite, he ceases to have  desires, and receding from all desires realizes the ultimate truth  of himself in his own infinitude. Man is as it were the epitome  of the universe and he holds within himself the fine constituents  of the gross body (_annamaya ko@sa_), the vital functions (_pra@namaya  ko@sa_) of life, the will and desire (_manomaya_) and the  thoughts and ideas (_vijnanamaya_), and so long as he keeps himself  in these spheres and passes through a series of experiences  in the present life and in other lives to come, these experiences  are willed by him and in that sense created by him. He suffers  pleasures and pains, disease and death. But if he retires from  these into his true unchangeable being, he is in a state where he  is one with his experience and there is no change and no movement.  What this state is cannot be explained by the use of  concepts. One could only indicate it by pointing out that it is  not any of those concepts found in ordinary knowledge; it is not    _________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Ka@tha II. The translation is not continuous. There are some  parts in the extract which may be differently interpreted.]    61    whatever one knows as this and this (_neti neti_). In this infinite  and true self there is no difference, no diversity, no _meum_ and  _tuum_. It is like an ocean in which all our phenomenal existence  will dissolve like salt in water. \"Just as a lump of salt when put  in water will disappear in it and it cannot be taken out separately  but in whatever portion of water we taste we find the salt, so,  Maitreyi, does this great reality infinite and limitless consisting  only of pure intelligence manifesting itself in all these (phenomenal  existences) vanish in them and there is then no phenomenal knowledge\"  (B@rh. II. 4. 12). The true self manifests itself in all the  processes of our phenomenal existences, but ultimately when it  retires back to itself, it can no longer be found in them. It is a  state of absolute infinitude of pure intelligence, pure being, and  pure blessedness.    62        CHAPTER IV      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SYSTEMS  OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY      In what Sense is a History of Indian Philosophy possible?    It is hardly possible to attempt a history of Indian philosophy  in the manner in which the histories of European philosophy have  been written. In Europe from the earliest times, thinkers came  one after another and offered their independent speculations  on philosophy. The work of a modern historian consists in  chronologically arranging these views and in commenting upon  the influence of one school upon another or upon the general  change from time to time in the tides and currents of philosophy.  Here in India, however, the principal systems of philosophy had  their beginning in times of which we have but scanty record, and  it is hardly possible to say correctly at what time they began,  or to compute the influence that led to the foundation of so many  divergent systems at so early a period, for in all probability these  were formulated just after the earliest Upani@sads had been composed  or arranged.    The systematic treatises were written in short and pregnant  half-sentences (_sutras_) which did not elaborate the subject in  detail, but served only to hold before the reader the lost threads  of memory of elaborate disquisitions with which he was already  thoroughly acquainted. It seems, therefore, that these pithy half-sentences  were like lecture hints, intended for those who had had  direct elaborate oral instructions on the subject. It is indeed  difficult to guess from the sutras the extent of their significance,  or how far the discussions which they gave rise to in later days were  originally intended by them. The sutras of the Vedanta system,  known as the S'ariraka-sutras or Brahma-sutras of Badaraya@na  for example were of so ambiguous a nature that they gave rise  to more than half a dozen divergent interpretations, each one  of which claimed to be the only faithful one. Such was the high  esteem and respect in which these writers of the sutras were held  by later writers that whenever they had any new speculations to    63    offer, these were reconciled with the doctrines of one or other of  the existing systems, and put down as faithful interpretations of  the system in the form of commentaries. Such was the hold of  these systems upon scholars that all the orthodox teachers since  the foundation of the systems of philosophy belonged to one or  other of these schools. Their pupils were thus naturally brought  up in accordance with the views of their teachers. All the independence  of their thinking was limited and enchained by the faith of the school  to which they were attached. Instead of producing a succession of  free-lance thinkers having their own systems to propound and establish,  India had brought forth schools of pupils who carried the traditionary  views of particular systems from generation to generation, who explained  and expounded them, and defended them against the attacks of other  rival schools which they constantly attacked in order to establish  the superiority of the system to which they adhered. To take an  example, the Nyaya system of philosophy consisting of a number  of half-sentences or sutras is attributed to Gautama, also called  Ak@sapada. The earliest commentary on these sutras, called the  _Vatsyayana bha@sya_, was written by Vatsyayana. This work was  sharply criticized by the Buddhist Di@nnaga, and to answer these  criticisms Udyotakara wrote a commentary on this commentary  called the _Bha@syavattika_ [Footnote ref 1]. As time went on the original  force of this work was lost, and it failed to maintain the old dignity of  the school. At this Vacaspati Mis'ra wrote a commentary called  _Varttika-tatparya@tika_ on this second commentary, where he tried  to refute all objections against the Nyaya system made by other  rival schools and particularly by the Buddhists. This commentary,  called _Nyaya-tatparya@tika_, had another commentary called  _Nyaya-tatparya@tika-paris'uddhi_ written by the great Udayana. This  commentary had another commentary called _Nyaya-nibandha-prakas'a_  written by Varddhamana the son of the illustrious Ga@nges'a. This  again had another commentary called _Varddha-manendu_ upon it by  Padmanabha Mis'ra, and this again had another named  _Nyaya-tatparyama@n@dana_ by S'a@nkara Mis'ra. The names of  Vatsyayana, Vacaspati, and Udayana are indeed very great,  but even they contented themselves by writing commentaries  on commentaries, and did not try to formulate any    _______________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: I have preferred to spell Di@nnaga after Vacaspati's  _Tatparyatika_ (p. I) and not Dignnaga as it is generally spelt.]    64    original system. Even S'a@nkara, probably the greatest man of  India after Buddha, spent his life in writing commentaries on the  _Brahma-sutras_, the Upani@sads, and the _Bhagavadgita_.    As a system passed on it had to meet unexpected opponents  and troublesome criticisms for which it was not in the least prepared.  Its adherents had therefore to use all their ingenuity and  subtlety in support of their own positions, and to discover the  defects of the rival schools that attacked them. A system as it was  originally formulated in the sutras had probably but few problems  to solve, but as it fought its way in the teeth of opposition of  other schools, it had to offer consistent opinions on other problems  in which the original views were more or less involved but to  which no attention had been given before.    The contributions of the successive commentators served to  make each system more and more complete in all its parts, and  stronger and stronger to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12975"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#19)"],[1,"Curry's wit, introduced after a defeat in a conversational  contest with Lady Morgan. \"It was the fashion then for ladies to  wear very short sleeves; and Lady Morgan, albeit not a young woman,  with true provincial exaggeration, wore none--a mere strap over her  shoulders.
