There surely was a reason for it if He  was so sweepingly rejected. So John in his old age writes. His chief  thought is to show that from the first Jesus was _accepted by individuals_  as well as _rejected by the nation_. These two things run neck and neck  through his twenty-one chapters, along the pathway he makes of witnessed,  established facts regarding Jesus. The nation--the small, powerfully  entrenched group of men who held the nation's leadership in their  tenacious fingers--the nation rejects. It's true. But the ugly reason is  plain to all, even the Roman who gave final sentence. From the first,  Jesus was accepted by men of all classes, including the most thoughtful  and scholarly.    He is writing to the generation that has grown up since Jesus has gone,  and so to all after generations that knew of Him first by _hearing_ of  Him. He is writing after the Jewish capital has been leveled to the  ground, and the nation utterly destroyed as a nation, and to people away  from Palestine. So he explains Jewish usages and words as well as places  in Palestine, to make the story plain and vivid to all. And the one point  at which he drives constantly is to make it clear to all after  generations that men of every sort of Jesus' own generation believed;  questioned, doubted, examined, weighed, _believed_, with whole-hearted  loving loyalty followed this Jesus.    This decides the order in which, with such rare wisdom, the churchmen  later arranged the four gospels in grouping the New Testament books. The  order is that of the growth of the new faith of the church from the Jewish  outward. Next to the Hebrew pages lies the gap gospel, then the earliest,  simplest telling, then the outsiders' gospel, and then the gospel for  after generations.        <u>The Surprised Church.</u>      Man proposes. God disposes. Man may for a time set aside God's plan, but  through any series of contrary events God holds steadily to His own plan.  Temporary defeat is only adjournment, paving the way for later and greater  victory. Another surprise is for the church, that is, the church of later  generations, including our own. The old Jew saw only a triumphant king,  not a suffering king. He saw only a kingdom. There was no hint of any such  thing as a church. The church to-day, and since the day of Constantine,  sees only a church. The kingdom has merged into the church or slipped out  of view.    There seems to be a confused mixing of church and kingdom, but always with  the church the big thing, and the kingdom a sort of vague,  indefinite--folks don't seem to know just what--an ideal, a spiritual  conception, or something like that. The church is supposed to have taken  the place of the kingdom. Its mission seems to be supposed to be the doing  for the world what the kingdom was to do, but, being set aside, failed to  do.    In reading the old Book there is a handy sort of explanation largely in  use that applies all that can be fitted into the theory in hand, and  calmly ignores or conveniently adjusts the rest. The Old Testament  blessings for the Jewish kingdom are appropriated and applied to the  church. The curses there are handed over to the Jews or ignored. There  seems to be a plan of interpreting one part of the Bible one way and  another part in a different way. This part is to be taken literally. This  other not literally, spiritually, the only guiding principle being the  man's preconceived idea of what should be. The air seems quite a bit foggy  sometimes. A man has to go off for a bit of fresh air and get straightened  out with himself inside.    A whiff of keen, sharp air seems needed to clear the fog and bring out the  old outlines--a whiff?--a gale! Yet it must needs blow, like God's wind of  grace always blows, as a soft gentle breeze. The common law among folk in  all other matters for understanding any book or document is that some one  rule of interpretation be applied consistently to all its parts. If we  attempt to apply here the rule of first-flush, common sense meaning, as  would be done to a house lease or an insurance policy, it brings out this  surprising thing. The church is distinct from the kingdom. It came  through the kingdom failing to come. It fits into a gap in the kingdom  plan. It has a mission quite distinct from that of the kingdom.    The church is to complete its mission and go. The kingdom, in the plain  meaning of the word kingdom, is to come, and be the dominant thing before  the eyes of all men. The church goes up and out. The kingdom comes in and  down. Later the church is to be a part of the executive of the kingdom.  This seems to be the simple standpoint of the Book.    The tragic break does not hinder the working of the plan. It simply  _retards_ it awhile. A _long_ while? Yes--to man, who counts time by the  bulky measurement of years, and can't seem to shake off the _time_ idea;  who gets absorbed in moments and hours and loses the broad swing of  things. To God?--No. He lives in eternities, and reckons things by events.  His eye never loses the whole, nor a single detail of the whole.    But yet more. That break leads to an _enriching_ of the plan. Out of hate  God reveals love. Not a greater love, but a greater opportunity for  greatly revealing love. Man's unwillingness and opposition may _delay_  God's plan, but cannot hinder it. A man can hinder it for his own self if  he so insist. But for others he can only delay, not hinder. Though God may  patiently yield His own plan, for a time, to something else, through which  meanwhile His main purpose is being served, yet He never loses sight of  His own plan--the highest expression of His love. And when He does so  yield, it is that _through_ the interruption He may in the long run work  out the higher and the highest.    And so in the fulfilment of God's plan as given by His Hebrew spokesmen,  there is a sort of sliding scale. A partial fulfilment takes place,  leaving the full fulfilment for the full working out of the plan. The  fulfilment takes place in two stages, the first being only less full than  the final. Thus Elijah is to come. But first comes John, a man with most  striking resemblance to Elijah. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit  prophesied in Joel is to be upon _all_ flesh. But before that takes place,  comes the Pentecost outpouring, filling out the Joel prophecy in spirit,  but not in the full measure.    As a matter of good faith the King must come back and carry out the  kingdom plan in full. And judging simply by the character of God and of  Jesus, I haven't a bit of doubt that He will do it. No amount of  disturbance ever alters the love of God, nor His love-plan in the long  run, however patiently He may bear with breaks.    Even this phase is in the minor strain of the old Hebrew. \"They shall look  upon Him whom they have _pierced;_ and they shall _mourn_ for Him, as one  mourneth for his only son.\" _There_ is a future meeting of the rejected  King and His rejecting people, and this time with sorrow for their former  conduct, which implies different conduct at this meeting time. And to this  agrees the whole swing of the New Testament teaching. Peter says the  going away of Jesus is to be \"_until_ the restitution of all things.\" He  is to return and carry out the old plan.    It's a bit unfortunate that some earnest, lovable people have pushed this  phase of truth so much to the front as to get it out of its proportion in  the whole circle of truth. Truth must always be kept in its place in the  circle of truth. Truth is fact in right proportion. Out of that it begins  to breed misstatement and error. Jesus' coming back is not to wind things  up. It is to begin things anew. There will be certain phases of judgment,  doubtless, a clearing of the deck for action, but no general judgment till  long after. The kingdom is to swing to the front, and bring a new life to  the earth for a very long time. Then after that the wind-up.    The gospel preached in the Acts is the \"gospel of the _kingdom_.\" They are  always expecting it to come. Paul constantly alludes to the Master's  return as the great thing to look forward to, as distinctly at the close  as at the beginning of his ministry. The book of Revelation is distinctly  a kingdom book, and however it may, with the versatility of Scripture to  serve a double purpose, foreshadow the characteristics of history for the  centuries since its writing, plainly its first meaning has to do with the  time when \"the kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and  of His Christ.\" The King is coming back to straighten matters out, and  organize a new running of things. This is the church's surprise, and a  great surprise it will apparently be to a great many folks, though not to  all.        <u>The Surprising Jew.</u>      There is a third surprise growing out of this tragic break, the greatest  of all--_the Jew_. The first surprises were for the Jew, the later  surprise for the church; this surprise has been and is for all the world.  The Jew has been the running puzzle of history. A strange, elusive,  surprising puzzle he has been to historians and all others. Not a nation,  only a people, flagless, countryless, without any semblance of  organization, they have been mixed in with all the peoples of the earth,  yet always distinctly separate.    They have been persecuted, bitterly, cruelly, persistently persecuted, as  no other people has ever been, yet with a power of recovery of none other  too. With an astonishing vitality, resourcefulness, and leadership, they  have taken front rank in every circle of life and every phase of activity,  in art, music, science, commerce, philanthropy, statesmanship; holding the  keys of government for great nations, of treasure boxes, and of exclusive  social circles; making their own standards regardless of others, and with  the peculiarity of strongest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#19)"],[1,"their troops and their cannon, and a great fight  took place, and soon the ground was covered with dead bodies. And the  Sultan commanded them to stop, as the women and children in the city  were being killed by the cannon-balls, but the General said:    \"If you give your daughter to Bantugan we shall fight forever or  until we die.\"    Then the Sultan sent for Bantugan and said:    \"We must deceive the Spaniard in order to get him to go away. Let us  tell him that neither of you will marry my daughter, and then after  he has gone, we shall have the wedding.\"    Bantugan agreed to this, and word was sent to the Spaniards that the  fighting must cease since many women and children were being killed. So  it was agreed between the Spaniard and Bantugan that neither of them  should marry the Princess. Then they both sailed away to their homes.    Bantugan soon returned, however, and married the Princess, and  on the way back to his home they found his son and took him with  them. For about a week the Spanish general sailed toward his home  and then he, too, turned about to go back, planning to take the  Princess by force. When he found that she had already been carried  away by Bantugan, his wrath knew no bounds. He destroyed the Sultan,  his city, and all its people. And then he sailed away to prepare a  great expedition with which he should utterly destroy Bantugan and  his country as well.    One morning Bantugan looked out and saw at the mouth of the Rio Grande  the enormous fleet of the Spaniards whose numbers were so great that  in no direction could the horizon be seen. His heart sank within him,  for he knew that he and his country were doomed.    Though he could not hope to win in a fight against such great numbers,  he called his headmen together and said:    \"My Brothers, the Christian dogs have come to destroy the land. We  cannot successfully oppose them, but in the defense of the fatherland  we can die.\"    So the great warship was again prepared, and all the soldiers of  Islam embarked, and then with Bantugan standing at the bow they sailed  forth to meet their fate.    The fighting was fast and furious, but soon the great warship of  Bantugan filled with water until at last it sank, drawing with it  hundreds of the Spanish ships. And then a strange thing happened. At  the very spot where Bantugan's warship sank, there arose from the sea a  great island which you can see today not far from the mouth of the Rio  Grande. It is covered with bongo palms, and deep within its mountains  live Bantugan and his warriors. A Moro sailboat passing this island  is always scanned by Bantugan's watchers, and if it contains women  such as he admires, they are snatched from their seats and carried  deep into the heart of the mountain. For this reason Moro women fear  even to sail near the island of Bongos.    When the wife of Bantugan saw that her husband was no more and that  his warship had been destroyed, she gathered together the remaining  warriors and set forth herself to avenge him. In a few hours her  ship was also sunk, and in the place where it sank there arose the  mountain of Timaco.    On this thickly wooded island are found white monkeys, the servants  of the Princess, who still lives in the center of the mountain. On  a quiet day high up on the mountain side one can hear the chanting  and singing of the waiting-girls of the wife of Bantugan.            CHRISTIANIZED TRIBES        Introduction      When the Spaniards discovered the Philippines in the sixteenth century,  they found the tribes along the coasts of the different islands already  somewhat influenced by trade with China, Siam, and the islands to  the south.    Under Spanish rule the coast inhabitants, with the exception of the  Moro, soon became converts to Christianity and adopted the dress of  their conquerors, though they retained their several dialects and  many of their former customs. Then, no longer being at war with one  another, they made great advances in civilization, while the hill  tribes have remained isolated, retaining their old customs and beliefs.    The tales of the Christianized tribes include a great mixture of  old ideas and foreign influences obtained through contact with the  outside world.        The Monkey and the Turtle    _Ilocano_      A monkey, looking very sad and dejected, was walking along the bank  of the river one day when he met a turtle.    \"How are you?\" asked the turtle, noticing that he looked sad.    The monkey replied, \"Oh, my friend, I am very hungry. The squash of  Mr. Farmer were all taken by the other monkeys, and now I am about  to die from want of food.\"    \"Do not be discouraged,\" said the turtle; \"take a bolo and follow me  and we will steal some banana plants.\"    So they walked along together until they found some nice plants which  they dug up, and then they looked for a place to set them. Finally  the monkey climbed a tree and planted his in it, but as the turtle  could not climb he dug a hole in the ground and set his there.    When their work was finished they went away, planning what they should  do with their crop. The monkey said:    \"When my tree bears fruit, I shall sell it and have a great deal  of money.\"    And the turtle said: \"When my tree bears fruit, I shall sell it and  buy three varas of cloth to wear in place of this cracked shell.\"    A few weeks later they went back to the place to see their plants and  found that that of the monkey was dead, for its roots had had no soil  in the tree, but that of the turtle was tall and bearing fruit.    \"I will climb to the top so that we can get the fruit,\" said the  monkey. And he sprang up the tree, leaving the poor turtle on the  ground alone.    \"Please give me some to eat,\" called the turtle, but the monkey threw  him only a green one and ate all the ripe ones himself.    When he had eaten all the good bananas, the monkey stretched his arms  around the tree and went to sleep. The turtle, seeing this, was very  angry and considered how he might punish the thief. Having decided  on a scheme, he gathered some sharp bamboo which he stuck all around  under the tree, and then he exclaimed:    \"Crocodile is coming! Crocodile is coming!\"    The monkey was so startled at the cry that he fell upon the sharp  bamboo and was killed.    Then the turtle cut the dead monkey into pieces, put salt on it, and  dried it in the sun. The next day, he went to the mountains and sold  his meat to other monkeys who gladly gave him squash in return. As  he was leaving them he called back:    \"Lazy fellows, you are now eating your own body; you are now eating  your own body.\"    Then the monkeys ran and caught him and carried him to their own home.    \"Let us take a hatchet,\" said one old monkey, \"and cut him into very  small pieces.\"    But the turtle laughed and said: \"That is just what I like, I have  been struck with a hatchet many times. Do you not see the black scars  on my shell?\"    Then one of the other monkeys said: \"Let us throw him into the water,\"    At this the turtle cried and begged them to spare his life, but they  paid no heed to his pleadings and threw him into the water. He sank  to the bottom, but very soon came up with a lobster. The monkeys  were greatly surprised at this and begged him to tell them how to  catch lobsters.    \"I tied one end of a string around my waist,\" said the turtle. \"To  the other end of the string I tied a stone so that I would sink.\"    The monkeys immediately tied strings around themselves as the turtle  said, and when all was ready they plunged into the water never to  come up again.    And to this day monkeys do not like to eat meat, because they remember  the ancient story. [149]        The Poor Fisherman and His Wife    _Ilocano_      Many, many years ago a poor fisherman and his wife lived with their  three sons in a village by the sea. One day the old man set his snare  in the water not far from his house, and at night when he went to look  at it, he found that he had caught a great white fish. This startled  the old man very much, for he had never seen a fish like this before,  and it occurred to him that it was the priest of the town.    He ran to his wife as fast as he could and cried:    \"My wife, I have caught the priest.\"    \"What?\" said the old woman, terrified at the sight of her frightened  husband.    \"I have caught the priest,\" said the old man again.    They hurried together to the river where the snare was set, and when  the old woman saw the fish, she cried:    \"Oh, it is not the priest but the governor.\"    \"No, it is the priest,\" insisted the old man, and they went home  trembling with fear.    That night neither of them was able to sleep for thought of the  terrible thing that had happened and wondering what they should do. Now  the next day was a great holiday in the town. At four o'clock in the  morning cannons were fired and bells rang loudly. The old man and  woman, hearing all the noise and  not knowing the reason for it,  thought that their crime had been discovered, and the people were  searching for them to punish them, so they set out as fast as they  could to hide in the woods. On and on they went, stopping only to  rest so as to enable them to resume their flight.    The next morning they reached the woods near Pilar, where there also  was a great holiday, and the sexton was ringing the bells to call  the people to mass. As soon as the old man and woman heard the bells  they thought the people there had been notified of their escape,  and that they, too, were trying to catch them. So they turned and  started home again.    As they reached their house, the three sons came home with their one  horse and tied it to the trunk of the caramay tree. Presently the  bells began to ring again, for it was twelve o'clock at noon. Not  thinking what time of day it was, the old man and woman ran out  of doors in terror, and seeing the horse jumped on its back with  the intention of"]]]
