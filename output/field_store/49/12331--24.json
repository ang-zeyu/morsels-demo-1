That Point is a Being like ourselves,  but confined to the non-dimensional Gulf.  He is himself his own World,  his own Universe; of any other than himself he can form no conception;  he knows not Length, nor Breadth, nor Height, for he has had no  experience of them; he has no cognizance even of the number Two; nor  has he a thought of Plurality; for he is himself his One and All, being  really Nothing.  Yet mark his perfect self-contentment, and hence learn  his lesson, that to be self-contented is to be vile and ignorant, and  that to aspire is better than to be blindly and impotently happy.  Now  listen.\"    He ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny,  low, monotonous, but distinct tinkling, as from one of your Spaceland  phonographs, from which I caught these words, \"Infinite beatitude of  existence!  It is; and there is nothing else beside It.\"    \"What,\" said I, \"does the puny creature mean by 'it'?\"  \"He means  himself,\" said the Sphere:  \"have you not noticed before now, that  babies and babyish people who cannot distinguish themselves from the  world, speak of themselves in the Third Person?  But hush!\"    \"It fills all Space,\" continued the little soliloquizing Creature, \"and  what It fills, It is.  What It thinks, that It utters; and what It  utters, that It hears; and It itself is Thinker, Utterer, Hearer,  Thought, Word, Audition; it is the One, and yet the All in All.  Ah,  the happiness, ah, the happiness of Being!\"    \"Can you not startle the little thing out of its complacency?\" said I.  \"Tell it what it really is, as you told me; reveal to it the narrow  limitations of Pointland, and lead it up to something higher.\" \"That is  no easy task,\" said my Master; \"try you.\"    Hereon, raising by voice to the uttermost, I addressed the Point as  follows:    \"Silence, silence, contemptible Creature.  You call yourself the All in  All, but you are the Nothing:  your so-called Universe is a mere speck  in a Line, and a Line is a mere shadow as compared with--\" \"Hush, hush,  you have said enough,\" interrupted the Sphere, \"now listen, and mark  the effect of your harangue on the King of Pointland.\"    The lustre of the Monarch, who beamed more brightly than ever upon  hearing my words, shewed clearly that he retained his complacency; and  I had hardly ceased when he took up his strain again.  \"Ah, the joy,  ah, the joy of Thought!  What can It not achieve by thinking!  Its own  Thought coming to Itself, suggestive of its disparagement, thereby to  enhance Its happiness!  Sweet rebellion stirred up to result in  triumph!  Ah, the divine creative power of the All in One!  Ah, the  joy, the joy of Being!\"    \"You see,\" said my Teacher, \"how little your words have done.  So far  as the Monarch understand them at all, he accepts them as his own--for  he cannot conceive of any other except himself--and plumes himself upon  the variety of 'Its Thought' as an instance of creative Power.  Let us  leave this God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his  omnipresence and omniscience:  nothing that you or I can do can rescue  him from his self-satisfaction.\"    After this, as we floated gently back to Flatland, I could hear the  mild voice of my Companion pointing the moral of my vision, and  stimulating me to aspire, and to teach others to aspire.  He had been  angered at first--he confessed--by my ambition to soar to Dimensions  above the Third; but, since then, he had received fresh insight, and he  was not too proud to acknowledge his error to a Pupil.  Then he  proceeded to initiate me into mysteries yet higher than those I had  witnessed, shewing me how to construct Extra-Solids by the motion of  Solids, and Double Extra-Solids by the motion of Extra-Solids, and all  \"strictly according to Analogy,\" all by methods so simple, so easy, as  to be patent even to the Female Sex.          SECTION 21  How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions              to my Grandson, and with what success      I awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before  me.  I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of  Flatland.  Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three  Dimensions be proclaimed.  I would begin with my Wife.    Just as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard the sound  of many voices in the street commanding silence.  Then followed a  louder voice.  It was a herald's proclamation.  Listening attentively,  I recognized the words of the Resolution of the Council, enjoining the  arrest, imprisonment, or execution of any one who should pervert the  minds of people by delusions, and by professing to have received  revelations from another World.    I reflected.  This danger was not to be trifled with.  It would be  better to avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation, and by  proceeding on the path of Demonstration--which after all, seemed so  simple and so conclusive that nothing would be lost by discarding the  former means.  \"Upward, not Northward\"--was the clue to the whole  proof.  It had seemed to me fairly clear before I fell asleep; and when  I first awoke, fresh from my dream, it had appeared as patent as  Arithmetic; but somehow it did not seem to me quite so obvious now.  Though my Wife entered the room opportunely at just that moment, I  decided, after we had exchanged a few words of commonplace  conversation, not to begin with her.    My Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing, and physicians  of no mean reputation, but not great in mathematics, and, in that  respect, unfit for my purpose.  But it occurred to me that a young and  docile Hexagon, with a mathematical turn, would be a most suitable  pupil.  Why therefore not make my first experiment with my little  precocious Grandson, whose casual remarks on the meaning of  three-to-the-third had met with the approval of the Sphere?  Discussing  the matter with him, a mere boy, I should be in perfect safety; for he  would know nothing of the Proclamation of the Council; whereas I could  not feel sure that my Sons--so greatly did their patriotism and  reverence for the Circles predominate over mere blind affection--might  not feel compelled to hand me over to the Prefect, if they found me  seriously maintaining the seditious heresy of the Third Dimension.    But the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way the curiosity  of my Wife, who naturally wished to know something of the reasons for  which the Circle had desired that mysterious interview, and of the  means by which he had entered the house.  Without entering into the  details of the elaborate account I gave her,--an account, I fear, not  quite so consistent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland might  desire,--I must be content with saying that I succeeded at last in  persuading her to return quietly to her household duties without  eliciting from me any reference to the World of Three Dimensions.  This  done, I immediately sent for my Grandson; for, to confess the truth, I  felt that all that I had seen and heard was in some strange way  slipping away from me, like the image of a half-grasped, tantalizing  dream, and I longed to essay my skill in making a first disciple.    When my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door.  Then,  sitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets,--or, as  you would call them, Lines--I told him we would resume the lesson of  yesterday.  I taught him once more how a Point by motion in One  Dimension produces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two Dimensions  produces a Square.  After this, forcing a laugh, I said, \"And now, you  scamp, you wanted to make believe that a Square may in the same way by  motion 'Upward, not Northward' produce another figure, a sort of extra  square in Three Dimensions.  Say that again, you young rascal.\"    At this moment we heard once more the herald's \"O yes! O yes!\" outside  in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council.  Young though  he was, my Grandson--who was unusually intelligent for his age, and  bred up in perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles--took in  the situation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared.  He  remained silent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away,  and then, bursting into tears, \"Dear Grandpapa,\" he said, \"that was  only my fun, and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not  know anything then about the new Law; and I don't think I said anything  about the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about  'Upward, not Northward,' for that would be such nonsense, you know.  How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward?  Upward and not  Northward!  Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd as that.  How silly it is!  Ha! ha! ha!\"    \"Not at all silly,\" said I, losing my temper; \"here for example, I take  this Square,\" and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square, which was  lying at hand--\"and I move it, you see, not Northward but--yes, I move  it Upward--that is to say, Northward but I move it somewhere--not  exactly like this, but somehow--\"  Here I brought my sentence to an  inane conclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner,  much to the amusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder  than ever, and declared that I was not teaching him, but joking with  him; and so saying he unlocked the door and ran out of the room.  Thus  ended my first attempt to convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three  Dimensions.          SECTION 22  How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three              Dimensions by other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#18)"],[1,"sea the bows of a ship make the worst possible bed, for they  toss up and down with sickening rapidity and jar quickly from side to  side; but when a vessel is plowing through a long-running ground swell,  the bows of the ship move with a sway more soothing than the swing of a  hammock in a wind. Under these circumstances Harrigan was lulled to  sleep.    He woke at length with a consciousness, not of a light shining in his  face, but of one that had just been flashed across his eyes. Then a  guarded voice said: \"He's dead to the world; he won't hear nothin'.\"    Peering cautiously up from under the shelter of his eyelashes, he made  out a bulky figure leaning above him.    \"Sure he's dead to the world,\" said a more distant voice. \"After the  day he must have put in with Campbell, he won't wake up till he's  dragged out. I know!\"    \"Lift his foot and let it drop,\" advised another. \"If you can do that  to a man without waking him, you know he's not going to be waked up by  any talkin'.\"    Harrigan's foot was immediately raised and dropped. He merely sighed as  if in sleep, and continued to breathe heavily, regularly. After a  moment he was conscious that the form above him had disappeared. Then  very slowly he turned his head and raised his eyelids merely enough to  peer through the lashes. The sailors sat cross-legged in a loose circle  on the floor of the forecastle. At the four corners of the group sat  four significant figures. They were like the posts of the prize ring  supporting the rope; that is to say, the less important sailors who sat  between them. Each of the four was a man of mark.    Facing Harrigan were Jacob Flint and Sam Hall. The former was a little  man, who might have lived unnoticed forever had it not been for a  terrible scar which deformed his face. It was a cut received in a knife  fight at a Chinese port. The white, gleaming line ran from the top of  his temple, across the side of his right eye, and down to the  cheekbone. The eye was blind as a result of the wound, but in healing  the cut had drawn the skin so that the lids of the eye were pulled awry  in a perpetual, villainous squint. It was said that before this wound  Flint had been merely an ordinary sailor, but that afterward he was  inspired to live up to the terror of his deformed face.    Sam Hall, the \"corner post,\" at Flint's right, was a type of blond  stupidity, huge of body, with a bull throat and a round, featureless  face. You looked in vain to find anything significant in this fellow  beyond his physical strength, until your glance lingered on his eyes.  They were pale blue, expressionless, but they hinted at possibilities  of berserker rage.    The other two, whose backs were toward Harrigan, were Garry Cochrane  and Jim Kyle. The latter might have stood for a portrait of a pirate of  the eighteenth century, with a drooping, red mustache and bristling  beard. The reputation of this monster, however, was far less terrible  than that of any of the other three, certainly far less than Garry  Cochrane. This was a lean fellow with bright black eyes, glittering  like a suspicious wolf's.    Between these corner posts sat the less distinguished sailors. They  might have been notable cutthroats in any other assemblage of  hard-living men, but here they granted precedence willingly to the four  more notable heroes.    Around the circle walked Jerry Hovey like a shepherd about his flock.  It was apparent that they all held him in high favor. His chief claim  to distinction, or perhaps his only one, was that he had served as  bos'n for ten years under White Henshaw; but this record was enough to  win the respect of even Garry Cochrane.    It was Jim Kyle who had peered into the face of Harrigan, for now he  was pushing to one side the lantern he had used and settling back into  his place in the circle. He gestured over his shoulder with his thumb.    \"How'd you happen to miss out with the Irishman, Jerry?\"    \"Talk low or you may wake him,\" warned Hovey. \"I lost him because the  fool ain't sailed long enough to know White Henshaw. He has an idea  that mutiny at night is like hittin' a man when he's down--as if there  was any other way of hittin' Henshaw an' gettin' away with it!\"    The chuckle of the sailors was like the rumble of the machinery below,  blended and lost with that sound.    \"So he's out--an' you know what that means,\" went on Hovey.    A light came into the pale eyes of Sam Hall, and his thick lips pulled  back in a grin.    \"Aye,\" he growled, \"we do! He's a strong man, but\"--and here he raised  his vast arms and stretched them--\"I'll tend to Harrigan!\"    The voice of the bos'n was sharp: \"None o' that! Wait till I give  orders, Sam, before you raise a hand. We're too far from the coast. Let  old Henshaw bring us close inshore, an' then we'll turn loose.\"    \"What I don't see,\" said one of the sailors, \"is how we make out for  hard cash after we hit the coast. We beach the Heron--all right; but  then we're turned loose in the woods without a cent.\"    \"You're a fool,\" said Garry Cochrane. \"We loot the ship before we  abandon her. There'll be money somewhere.\"    \"Aye,\" said Hovey, \"there's money. That's what I got you together for  tonight. There's money, and more of it than you ever dreamed of.\"    He waited for his words to take effect in the brains of the men,  running his glance around the circle, and a light flashed in response  to each eye as it met his.    He continued: \"White Henshaw cashed in every cent of his property  before he sailed in the _Heron_. I know, because he used me for some of  his errands. And I know that he had a big safe put into his cabin. For  ten years everything that White Henshaw has looked at turned into gold.  I know! All that gold he's got in that safe--you can lay to that.\"    He turned to the sailor who had first raised the question: \"Money?  You'll have your share of the loot--if you can carry it!\"    They drew in their breath as if they were drinking.    Hovey continued: \"Now, lads, I know you're gettin' excited and  impatient. That's why I've got you together. You've got to wait. And  until I give the word, you've got to keep your eyes on the deck an' run  every time one of the mates of White Henshaw--damn his heart!--gives  the word. Why? Because one wrong word--one queer look--will tip off the  skipper that something's wrong, and once he gets suspicious, you can  lay to it that he'll find out what we're plannin'. I _know!_\"    There was a grim significance in that repeated phrase, \"I _know_,\" for  it hinted at a knowledge more complete and evil than falls to the share  of the ordinary mortal.    \"Lads, keep your eyes on the deck and play the game until I give the  word! If the wind of this comes to the captain, it's overboard for  Jerry Hovey. I'd rather give myself to the sharks than to White  Henshaw. That's all.    \"Now, lads, it's come to the point where we've got to know what we'll  do. There's two ways. One is to crowd all them what ain't in the mutiny  into one cabin an' keep 'em there till we beach the boat.\"    \"So that they can get out and tell the land sharks what we've done?\"  suggested Garry Cochrane in disgust.    \"Garry,\" said Hovey with deep feeling, \"you're a lad after my heart.  And you're right. If one of them lives, he'll be enough to put a halter  around the necks of each of us. We couldn't get away. If we're once  described, there ain't no way we could dodge the law.\"    He grinned sardonically as he looked about the circle: \"There's  something about us, lads, that makes us different from other men.\"    The sailors glanced appreciatively at the scarred countenances of their  fellows and laughed hoarsely.    \"So the second way is the only way,\" went on Hovey, seeing that he had  scored his point. \"The rest of the crew that ain't with us has got to  go under. Are you with me?\"    \"Aye,\" croaked the chorus, and every man looked down at the floor. Each  one had picked out the man he hated the most, and was preparing the  manner of the killing.    \"Good,\" said Hovey; \"and now that we've agreed on that, we've got to  choose--\"    He stopped, going rigid and blank of face. He had seen the open,  chilling blue eye of Harrigan, who, drawn on into forgetfulness, had  lain for some time on his bunk watching the scene without caution.          CHAPTER 21      \"He's heard!\" stammered Hovey, pointing. \"Guard the door! Get him!\"    \"Bash in his head an' overboard with the lubber!\" growled Sam Hall.    Not one of the others spoke; their actions were the more significant.  Some leaped to the door and barred the exit.    Others started for Harrigan. The latter leaped off his bunk and,  sweeping up a short-legged, heavy stool, sprang back against the wall.  This he held poised, ready to drive it at the first man who approached.  Their semicircle grew compact before him, but still they hesitated, for  the man who made the first move would die.    \"You fools!\" said Harrigan, brandishing his stool. \"Keep off!\"    He was thinking desperately, quickly.    \"Harrigan,\" said Hovey, edging his way to the front of the sailors,  \"you heard!\"    \"I did!\"    They growled, infuriated. His death was certain now, but they kept back  for another moment, astonished that this man would sign his own  sentence of doom. From marlinspikes to pocketknives, every man held  some sort of a weapon. Garry Cochrane, flattening himself against the  wall at one side, edged inch by inch toward Harrigan.    \"I heard it all,\" said the Irishman, \"and until the last word I thought  you were a lot of bluffin' cowards.\"    \"You had your chance, Harrigan,\" said Hovey, \"an' you turned me down.  Now you get what's due you.\"    The sailors crouched a little as if at a command to leap forward in the  attack. Cochrane was perilously near.    \"If I get my due,\" said Harrigan coolly, \"you'll go down on your knees.  Stand back, Cochrane, or I'll brain ye! You'll go down on your knees  an' thank God that I'"]]]
