Where it does well, and then only as a wall plant, this and  its varieties are charming shrubs with neat foliage and an abundance of  showy flowers. The double-flowered varieties are very handsome, but they  are more suitable for glass culture than planting in the open.    M. LUMA (_syn Eugenia apiculata_ and _E. Luma_).--Chili. Though  sometimes seen growing out of doors, this is not to be recommended for  general planting, it being best suited for greenhouse culture.    M. UGNI (_syn Eugenia Ugni_).--Valdivia, 1845. A small-growing,  Myrtle-like shrub, that is only hardy in favoured parts of the country.  It is of branching habit, with small, wiry stems, oval, coriacious  leaves, and pretty pinky flowers. The edible fruit is highly ornamental,  being of a pleasing ruddy tinge tinted with white. This dwarf-growing  shrub wants the protection of a wall, and when so situated in warm  seaside parts of the country soon forms a bush of neat and pleasing  appearance.      NEILLIA.    NEILLIA OPULIFOLIA (_syn Spiraea opulifolia_).--Nine Bark. North  America, 1690. A hardy shrub, nearly allied to Spiraea. It produces a  profusion of umbel-like corymbs of pretty white flowers, that are  succeeded by curious swollen membraneous purplish fruit. N. opulifolia  aurea is worthy of culture, it being of free growth and distinct from  the parent plant.    N. THYRSIFLORA, Nepaul, 1850, would seem to be quite as hardy as N.  opulifolia, and is of more evergreen habit. The leaves are doubly  serrated and three lobed, and cordate-ovate. Flowers white in spicate,  thyrsoid racemes, and produced rather sparsely.      NESAEA.    NESAEA SALICIFOLIA (_syn Heimia salicifolia_).--Mexico, 1821. This can  only be styled as half hardy, but with wall protection it forms a pretty  bush often fully a yard in height. The leaves resemble those of some  species of Willow, being long and narrow, while the showy yellow flowers  are freely produced in August and September. It thrives best when  planted in light, dry soil, and in a sheltered position.      NEVIUSA.    NEVIUSA ALABAMENSIS.--Alabama Snow Wreath. Alabama, 1879. This is a rare  American shrub, with leaves reminding one of those of the Nine Bark,  Neillia opulifolia, and the flowers, which are freely produced along the  full length of the shoots, are white or yellowish-green, with prominent  stamens of a tufted brush-like character. It is usually treated as a  green-house plant, but may be seen growing and flowering freely in the  open ground at Kew.      NUTTALLIA.    NUTTALLIA CERASIFORMIS.--Osoberry. California, 1848. This shrub is of  great value on account of the flowers being produced in the early weeks  of the year, and when flowers are few and far between. It grows from 6  feet to 10 feet high, with a thick, twiggy head, and drooping racemes of  white flowers borne thickly all over the plant. Few soils come amiss to  this neglected shrub, it growing and flowering freely even on poor  gravelly clay, and where only a limited number of shrubs could succeed.      OLEARIA.    OLEARIA HAASTII.--New Zealand, 1872. This Composite shrub is only hardy  in the milder parts of England and Ireland. It is of stiff, dwarf  growth, rarely growing more than 4 feet high, but of neat and compact  habit. Flowering as it does in late summer it is rendered of special  value, the Daisy-like white blossoms being produced in large and flat  clusters at the branch tips. The leaves are neat and of leathery  texture, and being evergreen lend an additional charm to the shrub.    O. MACRODONTA (_syn O. dentata_), from New Zealand, 1886, is tolerably  hardy, and may be seen in good form both at Kew and in the South of  Ireland. The large Holly-like leaves are of a peculiar silvery-green  tint above, and almost white on the under sides. Flowers white, and  produced in dense heads in June and July.    O. Forsterii and O. Gunniana (_syn Eurybia Gunniana_) are nearly hardy  species, the latter, from New Zealand, bearing a profusion of white  Daisy-like flowers on dense, twiggy branches.      ONONIS.    ONONIS ARVENSIS.--Restharrow. A native undershrub of very variable size,  according to the position in which it is found growing. It creeps along  the ground, the shoots sending out roots as they proceed, and is usually  found on dry sandy banks. The flowers when at their best are very  ornamental, being bright pink, and with the standard streaked with a  deeper shade. They are abundantly produced, and render the plant very  conspicuous during the summer and autumn months. When planted on an old  wall, and allowed to roam at will, the Restharrow is, perhaps, seen to  best advantage.      OSMANTHUS.    OSMANTHUS AQUIFOLIUM ILLICIFOLIUS.--Holly-leaved Osmanthus. Japan. This  is a handsome evergreen shrub, with Holly-like leaves, and not very  conspicuous greenish-white flowers. It is a very desirable shrub, of  which there are varieties named O.A. ilicifolius argenteo-variegatus,  O.A. ilicifolius aureo-variegatus, and O.A. ilicifolius nanus, the  names of which will be sufficient to define their characters.    O.A. ILICIFOLIUS MYRTIFOLIUS.--Myrtle-leaved Osmanthus. A very distinct  and beautiful shrub, with unarmed leaves. It is of dwarf, compact  growth, with small, sharply-pointed leaves, and inconspicuous flowers.  For the front line of a shrubbery this is an invaluable shrub, its  pretty leaves and neat twiggy habit making it a favourite with planters.  The variety rotundifolius is seldom seen in cultivation, but being  distinct in foliage from any of the others is to be recommended. They  grow freely in any good garden soil, but all the better if a little peat  is added at the time of planting.      OSTRYA.    OSTRYA CARPINIFOLIA (_syn O. vulgaris_).--Common Hop Hornbeam. South  Europe, 1724. A much-branched, round-headed tree, with cordate-ovate,  acuminate leaves. Both this and the following species, by reason of the  resemblance between their female catkins and those of the Hop, and  between their leaves and those of the Hornbeam, have acquired the very  descriptive name of Hop Hornbeam. This is a large-growing tree,  specimens in various parts of the country ranging in height from 50 feet  to 60 feet.    O. VIRGINICA.--Virginian Hop Hornbeam. Eastern United States, 1692.  Resembles the latter, but is of smaller growth, rarely exceeding 40 feet  in height. They grow fairly well in almost any class of soil, and on  account of the long and showy catkins are well worthy of cultivation.      OXYDENDRUM.    OXYDENDRUM ARBOREUM (_syn Andromeda arborea_).--Sorrel-tree. Eastern  United States, 1752. Unfortunately this species is not often found under  cultivation, being unsuitable generally for our climate. In some  instances, however, it has done well, a specimen in the Knap Hill  Nursery, Surrey, being 30 feet high, and with a dense rounded head. The  flowers are very beautiful, being of a waxy white, and produced  abundantly. It wants a free rich soil, and not too exposed site.      OZOTHAMNUS.    OZOTHAMNUS ROSMARINIFOLIUS.--Australia, 1827. A pretty little Australian  Composite, forming a dense, twiggy shrub, with narrow, Rosemary-like  leaves, and small, whitish, Aster-like flowers which resemble those of  its near relative, the Olearia, and are produced so thickly that the  plant looks like a sheet of white when the blooms are fully developed.  It flowers in June and July. In most parts of the country it will  require protection, but can be classed as fairly hardy. Cuttings root  freely if placed in sandy soil in a cool frame.      PAEONIA.    PAEONIA MOUTAN.--Moutan Paeony, or Chinese Tree Paeony. China and Japan,  1789. A beautiful shrubby species introduced from China about one  hundred years ago. The first of the kind introduced to England had  single flowers, and the plant is figured in Andrews' _Botanists'  Repository_ (tab. 463) under the name of P. papaveracea. The flowers are  white with a dark red centre. In the _Botanical Magazine_ (tab. 2175),  the same plant is figured under the name of P. Moutan var. papaveracea.  This is perfectly hardy in our gardens, and is the parent of many  beautiful and distinct varieties, including double and single white,  pink, crimson, purple, and striped.      PALIURUS.    PALIURUS ACULEATUS (_syn P. australis_).--Christ's Thorn, or Garden  Thorn. Mediterranean region, 1596. A densely-branched, spiny shrub, with  small leaves, and not very showy, yellowish-green flowers. It grows and  flowers freely enough in light, peaty earth, but is not very hardy, the  tips of the branches being usually killed back should the winter be at  all severe.      PARROTIA.    PARROTIA PERSICA.--Persia, 1848. Well known for the lovely autumnal  tints displayed by the foliage when dying off. But for the flowers, too,  it is well worthy of culture, the crimson-tipped stamens of the male  flowers being singularly beautiful and uncommon. In February it is no  unusual sight to see on well-established plants whole branches that are  profusely furnished with these showy flowers. For planting in a warm  corner of a rather dry border it seems to be well suited; but it is  perfectly hardy and free of growth when suited with soil and site. It is  as yet rare in cultivation, but is sure, when better known and more  widely disseminated, to become a general favourite with lovers of hardy  shrubs.      PASSIFLORA.    PASSIFLORA CAERULEA.--Passion Flower. Brazil and Peru, 1699. Though not  perfectly hardy, yet this handsome climbing plant, if cut down to the  ground, usually shoots up freely again in the spring. The flowers, which  are produced very freely, but particularly in maritime districts, vary  from white to blue, and the prettily-fringed corona and centre of the  flower render the whole peculiarly interesting and beautiful. P.  caerulea Constance Elliott has greenish-white flowers; and P. caerulea  Colvillei has white sepals and a blue fringe."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"of hell, which was the region of  tormenting cold. Antmus, stooping, like the leaning tower of Bologna,  to take them up, gathered them in his arms, and, depositing them in the  gulf below, raised himself to depart like the mast of a ship.[42]    Had I hoarse and rugged words equal to my subject, says the poet, I  would now make them fuller of expression, to suit the rocky horror of  this hole of anguish; but I have not, and therefore approach it with  fear, since it is no jesting enterprise to describe the depths of the  universe, nor fit for a tongue that babbles of father and mother.[43]  Let such of the Muses assist me as turned the words of Amphion into  Theban walls; so shall the speech be not too far different from the  matter.    Oh, ill-starred creatures! wretched beyond all others, to inhabit a  place so hard to speak of--better had ye been sheep or goats.    The poet was beginning to walk with his guide along the place in which  the giant had set them down, and was still looking up at the height from  which he had descended, when a voice close to him said, \"Have a care  where thou treadest. Hurt not with thy feet the heads of thy unhappy  brethren.\"    Dante looked down and before him, and saw that he was walking on a lake  of ice, in which were Murderous Traitors up to their chins, their teeth  chattering, their faces held down, their eyes locked up frozen with  tears. Dante saw two at his feet so closely stuck together, that the  very hairs of their heads were mingled. He asked them who they were, and  as they lifted up their heads for astonishment, and felt the cold doubly  congeal them, they dashed their heads against one another for hate and  fury. They were two brothers who had murdered each other.[44] Near them  were other Tuscans, one of whom the cold had deprived of his ears; and  thousands more were seen grinning like dogs, for the pain.    Dante, as he went along, _kicked_ the face of one of them, whether by  chance, or fate, or _will_,[45] he could not say. The sufferer burst  into tears, and cried out, \"Wherefore dost thou torment me? Art thou  come to revenge the defeat at Montaperto?\" The pilgrim at this question  felt eager to know who he was; but the unhappy wretch would not tell.  His countryman seized him by the hair to force him; but still he said  he would not tell, were he to be scalped a thousand times. Dante, upon  this, began plucking up his hairs by the roots, the man _barking_,[46]  with his eyes squeezed up, at every pull; when another soul exclaimed,  \"Why, Bocca, what the devil ails thee? Must thou needs bark for cold as  well as chatter?\" [47]    \"Now, accursed traitor, betrayer of thy country's standard,\" said Dante,  \"be dumb if thou wilt; for I shall tell thy name to the world.\"    \"Tell and begone!\" said Bocca; \"but carry the name of this babbler with  thee; 'tis Buoso, who left the pass open to the enemy between Piedmont  and Parma; and near him is the traitor for the pope, Beccaria; and  Ganellone, who betrayed Charlemagne; and Tribaldello, who opened Faenza  to the enemy at night-time.\"    The pilgrims went on, and beheld two other spirits so closely locked up  together in one hole of the ice, that the head of one was right over the  other's, like a cowl; and Dante, to his horror, saw that the upper head  was devouring the lower with all the eagerness of a man who is famished.  The poet asked what could possibly make him skew a hate so brutal;  adding, that if there were any ground for it, he would tell the story to  the world.[48]    The sinner raised his head from the dire repast, and after wiping his  jaws with the hair of it, said, \"You ask a thing which it shakes me to  the heart to think of. It is a story to renew all my misery. But since  it will produce this wretch his due infamy, hear it, and you shall see  me speak and weep at the same time. How thou tamest hither I know not;  but I perceive by thy speech that thou art Florentine.    \"Learn, then, that I was the Count Ugolino, and this man was Ruggieri  the Archbishop. How I trusted him, and was betrayed into prison, there  is no need to relate; but of his treatment of me there, and how cruel a  death I underwent, bear; and then judge if he has offended me.    \"I had been imprisoned with my children a long time in the tower which  has since been called from me the Tower of Famine; and many a new moon  had I seen through the hole that served us for a window, when I dreamt a  dream that foreshadowed to me what was coming. Methought that this man  headed a great chase against the wolf, in the mountains between Pisa  and Lucca. Among the foremost in his party were Gualandi, Sismondi, and  Lanfranchi, and the hounds were thin and eager, and high-bred; and in a  little while I saw the hounds fasten on the flanks of the wolf and the  wolf's children, and tear them. At that moment I awoke with the voices  of my own children in my ears, asking for bread. Truly cruel must thou  be, if thy heart does not ache to think of what I thought then. If thou  feel not for a pang like that, what is it for which thou art accustomed  to feel? We were now all awake; and the time was at hand when they  brought us bread, and we had all dreamt dreams which made us anxious. At  that moment I heard the key of the horrible tower turn in the lock of  the door below, and fasten it. I looked at my children, and said not a  word. I did not weep. I made a strong effort upon the soul within me.  But my little Anselm said, 'Father, why do you look so? Is any thing the  matter?' Nevertheless I did not weep, nor say a word all the day, nor  the night that followed. In the morning a ray of light fell upon us  through the window of our sad prison, and I beheld in those four little  faces the likeness of my own face, and then I began to gnaw my hands for  misery. My children, thinking I did it for hunger, raised themselves on  the floor, and said, 'Father, we should be less miserable if you would  eat our own flesh. It was you that gave it us. Take it again.' Then I  sat still, in order not to make them unhappier: and that day and  the next we all remained without speaking. On the fourth day, Gaddo  stretched himself at my feet, and said, 'Father, why won't you help me?'  and there he died. And as surely as thou lookest on me, so surely I  beheld the whole three die in the same manner. So I began in my misery  to grope about in the dark for them, for I had become blind; and three  days I kept calling on them by name, though they were dead; till famine  did for me what grief had been unable to do.\"    With these words, the miserable man, his eyes starting from his head,  seized that other wretch again with his teeth, and ground them against  the skull as a dog does with a bone.    O Pisa! scandal of the nations! since thy neighbours are so slow to  punish thee, may the very islands tear themselves up from their roots in  the sea, and come and block up the mouth of thy river, and drown every  soul within thee. What if this Count Ugolino did, as report says he did,  betray thy castles to the enemy? his children had not betrayed them; nor  ought they to have been put to an agony like this. Their age was their  innocence; and their deaths have given thee the infamy of a second  Thebes.[49]    The pilgrims passed on, and beheld other traitors frozen up in swathes  of ice, with their heads upside down. Their very tears had hindered them  from shedding more; for their eyes were encrusted with the first they  shed, so as to be enclosed with them as in a crystal visor, which forced  back the others into an accumulation of anguish. One of the sufferers  begged Dante to relieve him of this ice, in order that he might vent a  little of the burden which it repressed. The poet said he would do so,  provided he would disclose who he was. The man said he was the friar  Alberigo, who invited some of his brotherhood to a banquet in order to  slay them.    \"What!\" exclaimed Dante, \"art thou no longer, then, among the living?\"    \"Perhaps I appear to be,\" answered the friar; \"for the moment any one  commits a treachery like mine, his soul gives up his body to a demon,  who thenceforward inhabits it in the man's likeness. Thou knowest Branca  Doria, who murdered his father-in-law, Zanche? He seems to be walking  the earth still, and yet he has been in this place many years.\" [50]    \"Impossible!\" cried Dante; \"Branca Doria is still alive; he eats,  drinks, and sleeps, like any other man.\"    \"I tell thee,\" returned the friar, \"that the soul of the man he slew had  not reached that lake of boiling pitch in which thou sawest him, ere the  soul of his slayer was in this place, and his body occupied by a demon  in its stead. But now stretch forth thy hand, and relieve mine eyes.\"    Dante relieved them not. Ill manners, he said, were the only courtesy  fit for such a wretch.[51]    O ye Genoese! he exclaims,--men that are perversity all over, and full  of every corruption to the core, why are ye not swept from the face of  the earth? There is one of you whom you fancy to be walking about like  other men, and he is all the while in the lowest pit of hell!    \"Look before thee,\" said Virgil, as they advanced: \"behold the banners  of the King of Hell.\"    Dante looked, and beheld something which appeared like a windmill in  motion, as seen from a distance on a dark night. A wind of inconceivable  sharpness came from it.    The souls of those who had been traitors to their benefactors were here  frozen up in depths of pellucid ice, where they were seen in a variety  of attitudes, motionless; some upright, some downward, some bent double,  head to foot.    At length they came to where the being stood who was once eminent for  all fair seeming.[52] This was the figure that seemed tossing its arms  at a distance like a windmill.    \"Satan,\" whispered Virgil; and put himself in front of Dante to  re-assure him, halting him at the same time, and bidding him summon all"]]]
