Lucian, most probably, by this tract totally  knocked up some of the historians who had given an account of it,  and prevented many others, who were intimidated by the severity of  his strictures, attempting to transmit the history of it to  posterity.    {19b} This saying is attributed to Empedocles.    {20a} The most famous of the Pontic cities, and well known as the  residence of the renowned Cynic philosopher.  It is still called by  the same name, and is a port town of Asiatic Turkey, on the Euxine.    {20b} A kind of school or gymnasium where the young men performed  their exercises.  The choice of such a place by a philosopher to  roll a tub in heightens the ridicule.    {21} See Homer's \"Odyssey,\" M 1. 219.    {23} Alluding to the story he set out with.    {24a} [Greek]. Gr.  The Latin translation renders it \"octava  duplici.\"  See Burney's \"Dissertation on Music,\" Sect. 1.    {24b} Gr. [Greek], aspera arteria, or the wind-pipe.  The comparison  is strictly just and remarkably true, as we may all recollect how  dreadful the sensation is when any part of our food slips down what  is generally called \"the wrong way.\"    {25a} See Homer's \"Iliad,\" [Greek] 1. 227, and Virgil's \"Camilla,\"  in the 7th book of the \"AEneid.\"    {25b} See Homer's \"Iliad,\" [Greek] 1. 18.  One of the blind bard's  speciosa miracula, which Lucian is perpetually laughing at.    {26} [Greek], or cerussa.  Painting, we see, both amongst men and  women, was practised long ago, and has at least the plea of  antiquity in its favour.  According to Lucian, the men laid on  white; for the [Greek] was probably ceruse, or white lead; the  ladies, we may suppose, as at present, preferred the rouge.    {29} Dinocrates.  The same story is told of him, with some little  alteration, by Vitruvius.  Mention is made of it likewise by Pliny  and Strabo.    {35} \"His buckler's mighty orb was next displayed;        Tremendous Gorgon frowned upon its field,        And circling terrors filled the expressive shield.        Within its concave hung a silver thong,        On which a mimic serpent creeps along,                 His azure length in easy waves extends,        Till, in three heads, th' embroidered monster ends.\"                          See Pope's \"Homer's Iliad,\" book xi., 1. 43.  Lucian here means to ridicule, not Homer, but the historian's absurd  imitation of him.    {39} The Greek expression was proverbial.  Horace has adopted it:  \"Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.\"    {40} Lucian adds, [Greek], ut est in proverbio, by which it appears  that barbers and their shops were as remarkable for gossiping and  tittle-tattle in ancient as they are in modern times.  Aristophanes  mentions them in his \"Plutus,\" they are recorded also by Plutarch,  and Theophrastus styles them [Greek].    {41} See Thucydides, book ii., cap. 34.    {42} Who fell upon his sword.  See the \"Ajax\" of Sophocles.    {43} For a description of this famous statue, see Pausanias.    {44} The [Greek], or scarus, is mentioned by several ancient  authors, as a fish of the most delicate flavour, and is supposed to  be of the same nature with our chars in Cumberland, and some other  parts of this kingdom.  I have ventured, therefore, to call it by  this name, till some modern Apicius can furnish me with a better.    {45} Dragons, or fiery serpents, were used by the Parthians, and  Suidas tells us, by the Scythians also, as standards, in the same  manner as the Romans made use of the eagle, and under every one of  these standards were a thousand men.  See Lips. de Mil. Rom., cap.  4.    {46} See Arrian.    {47} The idea here so deservedly laughed at, of a history of what  was to come, if treated, not seriously, as this absurd writer  treated it, but ludicrously, as Lucian would probably have treated  it himself, might open a fine field for wit and humour.  Something  of this kind appeared in a newspaper a few years ago, which, I  think, was called \"News for a Hundred Years Hence;\" and though but a  rough sketch, was well executed.  A larger work, on the same ground,  and by a good hand, might afford much entertainment.    {49} This kind of scholastic jargon was much in vogue in the time of  Lucian, and it is no wonder he should take every opportunity of  laughing at it, as nothing can be more opposite to true genius, wit,  and humour, than such pedantry.    {50} Milo, the Crotonian wrestler, is reported to have been a man of  most wonderful bodily strength, concerning which a number of lies  are told, for which the reader, if he pleases, may consult his  dictionary.  He lost his life, we are informed, by trying to rend  with his hands an old oak, which wedged him in, and pressed him to  death; the poet says--                                 \"--he met his end,       Wedged in that timber which he strove to rend.\"    Titornus was a rival of Milo's, and, according to AElian, who is not  always to be credited, rolled a large stone with ease, which Milo  with all his force could not stir.  Conon was some slim Macaroni of  that age, remarkable only for his debility, as was Leotrophides  also, of crazy memory, recorded by Aristophanes, in his comedy  called The Birds.    {51} The Broughtons of antiquity; men, we may suppose, renowned in  their time for teaching the young nobility of Greece to bruise one  another secundum artem.    {53a} See Diodorus Siculus, lib. vii., and Plutarch.    {53b} Concerning some of these facts, even recent as they were then  with regard to us, historians are divided.  Thucydides and Plutarch  tell the story one way, Diodorus and Justin another.  Well might our  author, therefore, find fault with their uncertainty.    {55a} Lucian alludes, it is supposed, to Ctesias, the physician to  Artaxerxes, whose history is stuffed with encomiums on his royal  patron.  See Plutarch's \"Artaxerxes.\"    {55b} The Campus Nisaeus, a large plain in Media, near the Caspian  mountains, was famous for breeding the finest horses, which were  allotted to the use of kings only; or, according to Xenophon, those  favourites on whom the sovereign thought proper to bestow them.  See  the \"Cyropaed.,\" book viii.    {56} This fine picture of a good historian has been copied by Tully,  Strabo, Polybius, and other writers; it is a standard of perfection,  however, which few writers, ancient or modern, have been able to  reach.  Thuanus has prefixed to his history these lines of Lucian;  but whether he, or any other historian, hath answered in every point  to the description here given, is, I believe, yet undetermined.    {57a} The saying is attributed to Aristophanes, though I cannot find  it there.  It is observable that this proverbial kind of expression,  for freedom of words and sentiments, has been adopted into almost  every language, though the image conveying it is different.  Thus  the Greeks call a fig a fig, etc.  We say, an honest man calls a  spade a spade; and the French call \"un chat un chat.\"  Boileau says,  \"J'appelle un chat un chat, et Rolet un fripon.\"    {57b} Herodotus's history is comprehended in nine books, to each of  which is prefixed the name of a Muse; the first is called Clio, the  second Euterpe, and so on.  A modern poet, I have been told, the  ingenious Mr. Aaron Hill, improved upon this thought, and christened  (if we may properly so call it), not his books, but his daughters by  the same poetical names of Miss Cli, Miss Melp-y, Miss Terps-y, Miss  Urania, etc.    {58} Both Thucydides and Livy are reprehensible in this particular;  and the same objection may be made to Thuanus, Clarendon, Burnet,  and many other modern historians.    {59} How just is this observation of Lucian's, and at the same time  how truly poetical is the image which he makes use of to express it!  It puts us in mind of his rival critic Longinus, who, as Pope has  observed, is himself the great sublime he draws.    {60} By this very just observation, Lucian means to censure all  those writers--and we have many such now amongst us--who take so  much pains to smooth and round their periods, as to disgust their  readers by the frequent repetition of it, as it naturally produces a  tiresome sameness in the sound of them; and at the same time  discovers too much that laborious art and care, which it is always  the author's business as much as possible to conceal.    {61} See Homer's \"Iliad,\" bk. xiii., 1. 4.    {62a} The famous Lacedaemonian general.  The circumstance alluded to  is in Thucydides, bk. iv.    {62b} Gr. [Greek], a technical term, borrowed from music, and  signifying that tone of the voice which exactly corresponds with the  instrument accompanying it.    {66a} A coarse fish that came from Pontus, or the Black Sea.--  Saperdas advehe Ponto.  See Pers. Sat. v. 1. 134.    {66b} Here doctors differ.  Several of Thucydides's descriptions are  certainly very long, many of them, perhaps, rather tedious.    {67} Lucian is rather severe on this writer.  Cicero only says, De  omnibus omnia libere palam dixit; he spoke freely of everybody.  Other writers, however, are of the same opinion with our satirist  with regard to him.  See Dions. Plutarch.  Cornelius Nepos, etc.    {69} Alluding to the story of Diogenes, as related in the beginning.    {75} See Homer's \"Odyssey.\"--The strange stories which Lucian here  mentions may certainly be numbered, with all due deference to so  great a name, amongst the nugae canorae of old Homer.  Juvenal  certainly considers them in this light when he says:--         Tam vacui capitis populum Phaeaca putavit.    Some modern critics, however, have endeavoured to defend them.    {77} Here the history begins, what goes before may be considered as  the author's preface, and should have been marked as such in the  original.    {79} Among the Greek wines, so much admired by ancient Epicures,  those of the islands of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#19)"],[1," unless a plan was reported he would  be in the position of returning empty-handed to the United States. I  urged him in the circumstances to secure the adoption of a resolution by  the delegates similar in nature, if not in language, to the draft which  was enclosed, thereby avoiding a state of affairs which would be very  disheartening to the advocates of a League of Nations and cause general  discontent among all peoples who impatiently expected evidence that the  restoration of peace was not far distant.    It would be presumptuous on my part to speculate on the President's  feelings when he received and read my letter and the proposed  resolution. It was never answered or acknowledged, and he did not act  upon the suggestion or discuss acting upon it, to my knowledge, with any  of his colleagues. On the contrary, he summoned the Commission on the  League of Nations to meet on February 3, eleven days before the date  fixed for his departure for the United States, and laid before that body  his revised draft of a Covenant which formed the groundwork for the  Commission's report presented to the Conference on February 14.    The question naturally arises--Why did the President ask me to complete  and send to him the resolution embodying a series of declarations if he  did not intend to make it a subject of consideration and discussion? It  is a pertinent question, but the true answer remains with Mr. Wilson  himself. Possibly he concluded that the only way to obtain his plan for  a League was to insist upon its practical acceptance before peace was  negotiated, and that, unless he took advantage of the universal demand  for peace by making the acceptance of the Covenant a condition  precedent, he would be unable to obtain its adoption. While I believe  this is a correct supposition, it is not responsive to the question as  to the reason why he wished me to deliver to him a draft resolution. In  fact it suggests another question--What, from the President's point of  view, was to be gained by having the resolution in his hands?    I think the answer is not difficult to find when one remembers that Mr.  Wilson had disapproved a resolution of that sort and that the Council of  Ten had seemed disposed to approve it. There was no surer way to prevent  me from bringing the subject again before the Council than by having the  proposed resolution before him for action. Having submitted it to him I  was bound, on account of our official relationship, to await his  decision before taking any further steps. In a word, his request for a  draft practically closed my mouth and tied my hands. If he sought to  check my activities with the members of the Council in favor of the  proposed course of action, he could have taken no more effectual way  than the one which he did take. It was undoubtedly an effective means of  \"pigeonholing\" a resolution, the further discussion of which might  interfere with his plan to force through a report upon the Covenant  before the middle of February.    This opinion as to the motive which impelled the President to pursue the  course that he did in regard to a resolution was not the one held by me  at the time. It was formed only after subsequent events threw new light  on the subject. The delay perplexed me at the time, but the reason for  it was not evident. I continued to hope, even after the Commission on  the League of Nations had assembled and had begun its deliberations,  that the policy of a resolution would be adopted. But, as the days went  by and the President made no mention of the proposal, I realized that he  did not intend to discuss it, and the conviction was forced upon me that  he had never intended to have it discussed. It was a disappointing  result and one which impressed me with the belief that Mr. Wilson was  prejudiced against any suggestion that I might make, if it in any way  differed with his own ideas even though it found favor with others.          CHAPTER X    THE GUARANTY IN THE REVISED COVENANT      During the three weeks preceding the meeting of the Commission on the  League the work of revising the President's original draft of the  Covenant had been in progress, the President and Colonel House holding  frequent interviews with the more influential delegates, particularly  the British and French statesmen who had been charged with the duty of  studying the subject. While I cannot speak from personal knowledge, I  learned that the suggested changes in terms and language were put into  form by members of the Colonel's office staff. In addition to  modifications which were made to meet the wishes of the foreign  statesmen, especially the British, Mr. Gordon Auchincloss, the  son-in-law and secretary of Colonel House, and Mr. David Hunter Miller,  Auchincloss's law partner and one of the accredited legal advisers of  the American Commission, prepared an elaborate memorandum on the  President's draft of a Covenant which contained comments and also  suggested changes in the text. On account of the intimate relations  existing between Messrs. Miller and Auchincloss and Colonel House it  seems reasonable to assume that their comments and suggestions were  approved by, if they did not to an extent originate with, the Colonel.  The memorandum was first made public by Mr. William C. Bullitt during  his hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in  September, 1919 (Senate Doc. 106, 66th Congress, 1st Session, pages 1177  _et seq._).    The most important amendment to the Covenant suggested by these advisers  was, in my judgment, the one relating to Article III of the draft, which  became Article 10 in the Treaty. After a long criticism of the  President's proposed guaranty, in which it is declared that \"such an  agreement would destroy the Monroe Doctrine,\" and that \"any guaranty of  independence and integrity means war by the guarantor if a breach of the  independence or integrity of the guaranteed State is attempted and  persisted in,\" the memorandum proposed that the following be  substituted:       \"Each Contracting Power severally covenants and guarantees that it     will not violate the territorial integrity or impair the political     independence of any other Contracting Power.\"    This proposed substitute should be compared with the language of the  \"self-denying covenant\" that I sent to the President on December 23,  1918, the pertinent portion of which is repeated here for the purpose of  such comparison:       \"Each power signatory or adherent hereto severally covenants and     guarantees that it will not violate the territorial integrity or     impair the political sovereignty of any other power signatory or     adherent to this convention, ...\"    The practical adoption of the language of my proposed substitute in the  memorandum furnishes conclusive proof that Colonel House was \"entirely  converted\" to my form of a guaranty as he had frankly assured me that he  was on the evening of January 6. I am convinced also that Mr. Henry  White and General Bliss held the same views on the subject. It is  obvious that President Wilson was the only one of the American  representatives at Paris who favored the affirmative guaranty, but, as  he possessed the constitutional authority to determine independently the  policy of the United States, his form of a guaranty was written into the  revised draft of a Covenant submitted to the Commission on the League of  Nations and with comparatively little change was finally adopted in the  Treaty of Peace with Germany.    The memorandum prepared by Messrs. Miller and Auchincloss was apparently  in the President's hands before the revised draft was completed, for  certain changes in the original draft were in accord with the  suggestions made in their memorandum. His failure to modify the guaranty  may be considered another rejection of the \"self-denying covenant\" and a  final decision to insist on the affirmative form of guaranty in spite of  the unanimous opposition of his American colleagues.    In view of what later occurred a very definite conclusion may be reached  concerning the President's rejection of the proposed substitute for his  guaranty. Article 10 was from the first the storm center of opposition  to the report of the Commission on the League of Nations and the chief  cause for refusal of consent to the ratification of the Treaty of  Versailles by the Senate of the United States. The vulnerable nature of  the provision, which had been so plainly pointed out to the President  before the Covenant was submitted to the Commission, invited attack. If  he had listened to the advice of his colleagues, in fact if he had  listened to any American who expressed an opinion on the subject, the  Treaty would probably have obtained the speedy approval of the Senate.  There would have been opposition from those inimical to the United  States entering any international organization, but it would have been  insufficient to prevent ratification of the Treaty.    As it was, the President's unalterable determination to have his form of  guaranty in the Covenant, in which he was successful, and his firm  refusal to modify it in any substantial way resulted in strengthening  the opponents to the League to such an extent that they were able to  prevent the Treaty from obtaining the necessary consent of two thirds of  the Senators.    The sincerity of Mr. Wilson's belief in the absolute necessity of the  guaranty, which he proposed, to the preservation of international peace  cannot be doubted. While his advisers were practically unanimous in the  opinion that policy, as well as principle, demanded a change in the  guaranty, he clung tenaciously to the affirmative form. The result was  that which was feared and predicted by his colleagues. The President,  and the President alone, must bear the responsibility for the result.
