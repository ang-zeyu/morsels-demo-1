Since then,  however, new sees have been founded which are under no such  restrictions: by the creation of dioceses either in native states  (Travancore and Cochin), or out of the existing dioceses (Chota  Nagpur, Lucknow, &c.). In the latter case there is no _legal_  subdivision of the older diocese, the new bishop administering  such districts as belonged to it under commission from its bishop,  provision being made, however, that in all matters ecclesiastical  there shall be no appeal but to the metropolitan of India.      _Spiritual autonomy._    (3) By degrees, also, the relations of colonial churches to the  archbishop of Canterbury have changed. Until 1855 no colonial bishop  was consecrated outside the British Isles, the first instance being  Dr. MacDougall of Labuan, consecrated in India under a commission  from the archbishop of Canterbury; and until 1874 it was held to be  unlawful for a bishop to be consecrated in England without taking the  suffragan's oath of due obedience. This necessity was removed by  the Colonial Clergy Act of 1874, which permits the archbishop at his  discretion to dispense with the oath. This, however, has not been done  in all cases; and as late as 1890 it was taken by the metropolitan of  Sydney at his consecration. Thus the constituent parts of the Anglican  communion gradually acquire autonomy: missionary jurisdictions develop  into organized dioceses, and dioceses are grouped into provinces with  canons of their own. But the most complete autonomy does not involve  isolation. The churches are in full communion with one another, and  act together in many ways; missionary jurisdictions and dioceses are  mapped out by common arrangement, and even transferred if it seems  advisable; _e.g._ the diocese Honolulu (Hawaii), previously under the  jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury, was transferred in 1900  to the Episcopal Church in the United States on account of political  changes. Though the see of Canterbury claims no primacy over the  Anglican communion analogous to that exercised over the Roman Church  by the popes, it is regarded with a strong affection and deference,  which shows itself by frequent consultation and interchange of  greetings. There is also a strong common life emphasized by common  action.    [v.02 p.0021]      _Pan-Anglican Congress._    The conference of Anglican bishops from all parts of the world,  instituted by Archbishop Longley in 1867, and known as the Lambeth  Conferences (_q.v._), though even for the Anglican communion they  have not the authority of an ecumenical synod, and their decisions  are rather of the nature of counsels than commands, have done much to  promote the harmony and co-operation of the various branches of the  Church. An even more imposing manifestation of this common life was  given by the great pan-Anglican congress held in London between the  12th and 24th of June 1908, which preceded the Lambeth conference  opened on the 5th of July. The idea of this originated with Bishop  Montgomery, secretary to the Society for the Propagation of the  Gospel, and was endorsed by a resolution of the United Boards of  Mission in 1903. As the result of negotiations and preparations  extending over five years, 250 bishops, together with delegates,  clerical and lay, from every diocese in the Anglican communion, met in  London, the opening service of intercession being held in Westminster  Abbey. In its general character, the meeting was but a Church congress  on an enlarged scale, and the subjects discussed, _e.g._. the attitude  of churchmen towards the question of the marriage laws or that of  socialism, followed much the same lines. The congress, of course,  had no power to decide or to legislate for the Church, its main value  being in drawing its scattered members closer together, in bringing  the newer and more isolated branches into consciousness of their  contact with the parent stem, and in opening the eyes of the Church  of England to the point of view and the peculiar problems of the  daughter-churches.    The Anglican communion consists of the following:--(1) The Church of  England, 2 provinces, Canterbury and York, with 24 and 11 dioceses  respectively. (2) The Church of Ireland, 2 provinces, Armagh and  Dublin, with 7 and 6 dioceses respectively. (3) The Scottish Episcopal  Church, with 7 dioceses. (4) The Protestant Episcopal Church of  the United States, with 89 dioceses and missionary jurisdictions,  including North Tokyo, Kyoto, Shanghai, Cape Palmas, and the  independent dioceses of Hayti and Brazil. (5) The Canadian Church,  consisting of (a) the province of Canada, with 10 dioceses; (b) the  province of Rupert's Land, with 8 dioceses. (6) The Church in India  and Ceylon, 1 province of 11 dioceses. (7) The Church of the West  Indies, 1 province of 8 dioceses, of which Barbados and the Windward  Islands are at present united. (8) The Australian Church, consisting  of (a) the province of New South Wales, with 10 dioceses; (b) the  province of Queensland, with 5 dioceses; (c) the province of Victoria,  with 5 dioceses. (9) The Church of New Zealand, 1 province of 7  dioceses, together with the missionary jurisdiction of Melanesia.  (10) The South African Church, 1 province of 10 dioceses, with the 2  missionary jurisdictions of Masbonaland and Lebombo. (11) Nearly 30  isolated dioceses and missionary jurisdictions holding mission from  the see of Canterbury.

ANGLING, the art or practice of the sport of catching fish by means of  a baited hook or \"angle\" (from the Indo-European root _ank-_, meaning  \"bend\").[1] It is among the most ancient of human activities, and may  be said to date from the time when man was in the infancy of the Stone  Age, eking out a precarious existence by the slaughter of any living  thing which he could reach with the rude weapons at his command. It is  probable that attack on fishes was at first much the same as attack  on animals, a matter of force rather than of guile, and conducted by  means of a rude spear with a flint head. It is probable, too, that the  primitive harpooners were not signally successful in their efforts,  and so set their wits to work to devise other means of getting at the  abundant food which waited for them in every piece of water near their  caves. Observation would soon show them that fish fed greedily on each  other and on other inhabitants of the water or living things that fell  into it, and so, no doubt, arose the idea of entangling the prey by  means of its appetite. Hence came the notion of the first hook, which,  it seems certain, was not a hook at all but a \"gorge,\" a piece of  flint or stone which the fish could swallow with the bait but which it  could not eject afterwards. From remains found in cave-dwellings and  their neighbourhood in different parts of the world it is obvious that  these gorges varied in shape, but in general the idea was the same, a  narrow strip of stone or flake of flint, either straight or slightly  curved at the ends, with a groove in the middle round which the line  could be fastened. Buried in the bait it would be swallowed end  first; then the tightening of the line would fix it cross-wise in the  quarry's, stomach or gullet and so the capture would be assured. The  device still lingers in France and in a few remote parts of England in  the method of catching eels which is known as \"sniggling.\" In this a  needle buried in a worm plays the part of the prehistoric gorge.    The evolution of the fish-hook from the slightly curved gorge is  easily intelligible. The ends became more and more curved, until  eventually an object not unlike a double hook was attained. This  development would be materially assisted by man's discovery of the  uses of bronze and its adaptability to his requirements. The single  hook, of the pattern more or less familiar to us, was possibly a  concession of the lake-dweller to what may even then have been a  problem--the \"education\" of fish, and to a recognition of the fact  that sport with the crude old methods was falling off. But it is  also not improbable that in some parts of the world the single hook  developed _pari passu_ with the double, and that, on the sea-shore  for instance, where man was able to employ so adaptable a substance as  shell, the first hook was a curved fragment of shell lashed with fibre  to a piece of wood or bone, in such a way that the shell formed the  bend of the hook while the wood or bone formed the shank. Both  early remains and recent hooks from the Fiji Islands bear out this  supposition. It is also likely that flint, horn and bone were pressed  into service in a similar manner. The nature of the line or the rod  that may have been used with these early hooks is largely a matter  of conjecture. The first line was perhaps the tendril of a plant, the  first rod possibly a sapling tree. But it is fairly obvious that the  rod must have been suggested by the necessity of getting the bait out  over obstacles which lay between the fisherman and the water, and  that it was a device for increasing both the reach of the arm and the  length of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#19)"],[1,"of dem old age pensions, but dey ain't give me nothin'  yet, so I jus' wuk when I kin, and hope dat it won't be long 'fore I has  plenty again.\"          OLD SLAVE STORY    DELLA BRISCOE  Macon, Georgia    By Adella S. Dixon [HW: (Colored)]  [JUL 28 1937]      Della Briscoe, now living in Macon, is a former slave of Mr. David Ross,  who owned a large plantation in Putnam County. Della, when a very tiny  child, was carried there with her father and mother, Sam and Mary Ross.  Soon after their arrival the mother was sent to work at the \"big house\"  in Eatonton. This arrangement left Della, her brother and sister to the  care of their grandmother, who really posed as their mother. The  children grew up under the impression that their mother was an older  sister and did not know the truth until just after the close of the  Civil War, when the mother became seriously ill and called the children  to her bedside to tell them goodbye.    Mr. David Ross had a large family and was considered the richest planter  in the county. Nearly every type of soil was found on his vast estate,  composed of hilly sections as well as acres of lowlands. The highway  entering Eatonton divided the plantation and, down this road every  Friday, Della's father drove the wagon to town with a supply of fresh  butter, for Mrs. Ross' thirty head of cows supplied enough milk to  furnish the city dwellers with butter.    Refrigeration was practically unknown, so a well was used to keep the  butter fresh. This cool well was eighty feet deep and passed through a  layer of solid rock. A rope ladder was suspended from the mouth of the  well to the place where the butter was lowered for preservation. For  safety, and to shield it from the sun, reeds were planted all around the  well. And as they grew very tall, a stranger would not suspect a well  being there.    In addition to marketing, Della's father trapped beavers which were  plentiful in the swampy part of the plantation bordering the Oconee,  selling their pelts to traders in the nearby towns of Augusta and  Savannah, where Mr. Ross also marketed his cotton and large quantities  of corn. Oxen, instead of mules, were used to make the trips to market  and return, each trip consuming six or seven days.    The young children were assigned small tasks, such as piling brush in  \"new grounds\", carrying water to field hands, and driving the calves to  pasture.    Punishment was administered, though not as often as on some plantations.  The little girl, Della, was whipped only once--for breaking up a  turkey's nest she had found. Several were accused of this, and because  the master could not find the guilty party, he whipped each of the  children.    Crime was practically unknown and Mr. Ross' slaves never heard of a jail  until they were freed.    Men were sometimes placed in \"bucks\", which meant they were laid across  blocks with their hands and feet securely tied. An iron bar was run  between the blocks to prevent any movement; then, after being stripped,  they were whipped. Della said that she knew of but one case of this  type of punishment being administered a Ross slave. Sickness was  negligible--childbirth being practically the only form of a Negro  woman's \"coming down\".    As a precaution against disease, a tonic was given each slave every  spring. Three were also, every spring, taken from the field each day  until every one had been given a dose of calomel and salts. Mr. Ross  once bought two slaves who became ill with smallpox soon after their  arrival. They were isolated in a small house located in the center of a  field, while one other slave was sent there to nurse them. All three  were burned to death when their hut was destroyed by fire.    In case of death, even on a neighboring place, all work was suspended  until the dead was buried.    Sunday, the only day of rest, was often spent in attending religious  services, and because these were irregularly held, brush arbor meetings  were common. This arbor was constructed of a brush roof supported by  posts and crude joists. The seats were usually made of small saplings  nailed to short stumps.    Religion was greatly stressed and every child was christened shortly  after its birth. An adult who desired to join the church went first to  the master to obtain his permission. He was then sent to the home of a  minister who lived a short distance away at a place called Flat Rock.  Here, his confession was made and, at the next regular service, he was  formally received into the church.    Courtships were brief.    The \"old man\", who was past the age for work and only had to watch what  went on at the quarters, was usually the first to notice a budding  friendship, which he reported to the master. The couple was then  questioned and, if they consented, were married without the benefit of  clergy.    Food was distributed on Monday night, and for each adult slave the  following staple products were allowed--        Weekly ration:                On Sunday:    3-1/2 lbs. meat               One qt. syrup    1 pk. of meal                 One gal. flour    1 gal. shorts                 One cup lard    Vegetables, milk, etc., could be obtained at the \"big house\", but fresh  meat and chickens were never given. The desire for these delicacies  often overcame the slaves' better natures, and some frequently went  night foraging for small shoats and chickens.    The \"old man\" kept account of the increase or decrease in live stock and  poultry and reported anything missing each day. When suspicion fell on a  visitor of the previous night, this information was given to his master,  who then searched the accused's dinner pail and cabin. If meat was found  in either the culprit was turned over to his accuser for punishment.  After being whipped, he was forbidden for three months to visit the  plantation where he had committed the theft.    One of Della's grandmother's favorite recipes was made of dried beef and  wheat. The wheat was brought from the field and husked by hand. This,  added to the rapidly boiling beef, was cooked until a mush resulted,  which was then eaten from wooden bowls with spoons of the same material.  White plates were never used by the slaves.    Cloth for clothing was woven on the place. Della's grandmother did most  of the spinning, and she taught her child to spin when she was so small  that she had to stand on a raised plank to reach the wheel. After the  cloth was spun it was dyed with dye made from \"shoemake\" (sumac) leaves,  green walnuts, reeds, and copperas. One person cut and others sewed. The  dresses for women were straight, like slips, and the garments of the  small boys resembled night shirts. If desired, a bias fold of  contrasting colour was placed at the waist line or at the bottom of  dresses. The crudely made garments were starched with a solution of  flour or meal and water which was strained and then boiled.    As a small child Della remembers hearing a peculiar knock on the door  during the night, and a voice which replied to queries, \"No one to hurt  you, but keep that red flannel in your mouth. Have you plenty to eat?  Don't worry; you'll be free.\" No one would ever tell, if they knew, to  whom this voice belonged.    Just before the beginning of the Civil War a comet appeared which was so  bright that the elder people amused themselves by sitting on the rail  fence and throwing pins upon the ground where the reflection was cast.  The children scrambled madly to see who could find the most pins.    During the early part of the war Mr. Ross fought with the Confederates,  leaving his young son, Robert, in charge of his affairs. The young  master was very fond of horses and his favorite horse--\"Bill\"--was  trained to do tricks. One of these was to lie down when tickled on his  flanks. The Yankees visited the plantation and tried to take this  horse. Robert, who loved him dearly, refused to dismount, and as they  were about to shoot the horse beneath him, the slaves began to plead.  They explained that the boy was kind to every one and devoted to  animals, after which explanation, he was allowed to keep his horse.    The breastworks at Savannah required many laborers to complete their  construction, and as the commanders desired to save the strength of  their soldiers, slave labor was solicited. Two slaves from each nearby  plantation were sent to work for a limited number of days. The round  trip from the Ross plantation required seven days.    Nearly every man had a family and when they returned from these long  trips they drove to the quarters and fell on their knees to receive the  welcome caresses of their small children.    Recreational facilities were not provided and slave children had little  knowledge of how to play. Their two main amusements were building frog  houses and sliding down a steep bank on a long board. One day, as they  played up and down the highway, building frog houses at irregular  intervals, little Della looked up and saw a group of Yankee calvarymen  approaching. She screamed and began running and so attracted the  attention of Mr. Ross who was at home on a furlough.    He saw the men in time to find a hiding place. Meanwhile, the soldiers  arrived and the leader, springing from his horse, snatched Della up and  spanked her soundly for giving the alarm, as they had hoped to take her  master by surprise. Della said this was the first \"white slap\" she ever  received.    Some of the Yankees entered the house, tore up the interior, and threw  the furniture out doors. Another group robbed the smokehouse and smashed  so many barrels of syrup that it ran in a stream through the yard. They  carried much of the meat off with them and gave the remainder to the  slaves. Chickens were caught, dressed, and fried on the spot as each  soldier carried his own frying pan, and a piece of flint rock and a  sponge with which to make a fire. The men were skilled in dressing fowls  and cleaned them in a"]]]
