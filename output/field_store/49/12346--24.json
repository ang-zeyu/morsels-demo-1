This was  the crisis of the battle. But the Athenian van was disorganized by its  own previous successes; and, yielding to the unexpected charge thus made  on it by troops in perfect order, and of the most obstinate courage, it  was driven back in confusion upon the other divisions of the army that  still continued to press forward. When once the tide was thus turned,  the Syracusans passed rapidly from the extreme of panic to the extreme  of vengeful daring, and with all their forces they now fiercely assailed  the embarrassed and receding Athenians. In vain did the officers of the  latter strive to reform their line. Amid the din and the shouting of the  fight, and the confusion inseparable upon a night engagement, especially  one where many thousand combatants were pent and whirled together in a  narrow and uneven area, the necessary manoeuvres were impracticable; and  though many companies still fought on desperately, wherever the  moonlight showed them the semblance of a foe, they fought without  concert or subordination; and not infrequently, amid the deadly chaos,  Athenian troops assailed each other. Keeping their ranks close, the  Syracusans and their allies pressed on against the disorganized masses  of the besiegers, and at length drove them, with heavy slaughter, over  the cliffs, which an hour or two before they had scaled full of hope and  apparently certain of success.    This defeat was decisive of the event of the siege. The Athenians  afterward struggled only to protect themselves from the vengeance which  the Syracusans sought to wreak in the complete destruction of their  invaders. Never, however, was vengeance more complete and terrible. A  series of sea-fights followed, in which the Athenian galleys were  utterly destroyed or captured. The mariners and soldiers who escaped  death in disastrous engagements, and a vain attempt to force a retreat  into the interior of the island, became prisoners of war. Nicias and  Demosthenes were put to death in cold blood, and their men either  perished miserably in the Syracusan dungeons or were sold into slavery  to the very persons whom, in their pride of power, they had crossed the  seas to enslave.    All danger from Athens to the independent nations of the West was now  forever at an end. She, indeed, continued to struggle against her  combined enemies and revolted allies with unparalleled gallantry, and  many more years of varying warfare passed away before she surrendered to  their arms. But no success in subsequent contests could ever have  restored her to the preeminence in enterprise, resources, and maritime  skill which she had acquired before her fatal reverses in Sicily. Nor  among the rival Greek republics, whom her own rashness aided to crush  her, was there any capable of reorganizing her empire, or resuming her  schemes of conquest. The dominion of Western Europe was left for Rome  and Carthage to dispute two centuries later, in conflicts still more  terrible, and with even higher displays of military daring and genius  than Athens had witnessed either in her rise, her meridian, or her fall.          RETREAT OF THE TEN THOUSAND GREEKS    B.C. 401-399    XENOPHON      (The expedition of the Greeks, generally known as the \"Retreat of the  Ten Thousand,\" was conducted by Xenophon, a Greek historian, essayist,  and military commander. Xenophon was a pupil of Socrates, of whom he  left a famous memoir. In B.C. 401 he accepted the invitation of his  friend Proxenus of Boeotia, a general of Greek mercenaries, to take  service under Cyrus the Younger, brother of Artaxerxes Mnemon, king of  Persia.    Cyrus had considered himself as deeply wronged by his elder brother, who  had thrown him into prison on the death of their father, Darius.  Escaping from prison, he formed a design to wrest the throne from  Artaxerxes. For this purpose he engaged the forces of Proxenus, and to  this army Xenophon attached himself. The rendezvous was Sardis, from  which the army marched east under the pretext of chastising the  revolting mountaineers of Pisidia. Instead of attacking the Pisidians,  the followers of Cyrus proceeded east through Asia and Babylonia till  they met the forces of Artaxerxes at Cunaxa. A furious battle took  place, and the rout of the king's army had begun when Cyrus, elated with  the victory that seemed just within his grasp, challenged his brother to  single combat. In the duel that ensued Cyrus was slain. Proxenus had  already fallen, and the virtual command of the Greek army soon devolved  upon Xenophon, who thereupon began the famous retreat.    A vivid account of battles, and of hardships endured from the cold, in  the struggle through mountain snows, through almost impassable forests,  and across bridgeless rivers, is given in Xenophon's _Anabasis_, the  celebrated work, in seven books, which forms the classical narrative of  the campaign and the retreat. Soon after the death of Cyrus, in  September, B.C. 401, the seizure and murder of the leading Greek  generals by the treacherous Persian satrap, Tissaphernes, placed the  Greek army in great peril. Xenophon, who now took practical command,  counselled and exhorted the surviving leaders, and on the next day the  Greeks formed in a hollow square, the baggage in the centre, and began  their retreat, which led them along the Tigris to the territory of the  Carduchi [Kurds], through Armenia, and across Georgia, the enemy often  harassing them.    At the point where the climax of the story, which is presented here, may  be said to begin, the Greeks have entered Armenia, passed the sources of  the Tigris, and reached the Teleboas. Having made a treaty with  Tiribazus, governor of the province, and discovered his insincerity, and  that he was ready to attack them in their passage over the mountains,  they resolved upon a quick resumption of their march.    When, in the fifth month of the retreat the Greeks at last from a  hilltop beheld the Euxine, they sent up a cry, \"The sea! the sea!\" which  has echoed through succeeding ages as one of the great historic  jubilations of humanity. At the end of the retreat their numbers were  reduced to about six thousand, and from the starting-point at Cunaxa to  the middle of the southern coast of the Black Sea they had travelled as  much as two thousand miles. From Ephesus to Cunaxa and thence to the  Black Sea region they had marched in fifteen months [February, B.C. 401,  to June, 400], and nine months more passed before they joined the  Spartan army in Asia Minor, and their task was fully accomplished. Their  great performance is regarded as having prepared the way for Alexander's  triumphant advances in the East. The young conqueror, on the eve of the  battle of Issus, declared that he owed inspiration to the feat of the  Ten Thousand.)      It was thought necessary to march away as fast as possible, before the  enemy's force should be reassembled, and get possession of the pass.    Collecting their baggage at once, therefore, they set forward through a  deep snow, taking with them several guides, and, having the same day  passed the height on which Tiribazus had intended to attack them, they  encamped. Hence they proceeded three days' journey through a desert  tract of country, a distance of fifteen _parasangs_, to the river  Euphrates, and passed it without being wet higher than the middle. The  sources of the river were said not to be far off. From hence they  advanced three days' march, through much snow and a level plain, a  distance of fifteen parasangs; the third day's march was extremely  troublesome, as the north wind blew full in their faces, completely  parching up everything and benumbing the men. One of the augurs, in  consequence, advised that they should sacrifice to the wind, and a  sacrifice was accordingly offered, when the vehemence of the wind  appeared to everyone manifestly to abate. The depth of the snow was a  fathom, so that many of the baggage cattle and slaves perished, with  about thirty of the soldiers.    They continued to burn fires through the whole night, for there was  plenty of wood at the place of encampment. But those who came up late  could get no wood; those, therefore, who had arrived before and had  kindled fires would not admit the late comers to the fire unless they  gave them a share of the corn or other provisions that they had brought.  Thus they shared with each other what they respectively had. In the  places where the fires were made, as the snow melted, there were formed  large pits that reached down to the ground, and here there was  accordingly opportunity to measure the depth of the snow.    From hence they marched through snow the whole of the following day, and  many of the men contracted the _bulimia_.[28] Xenophon, who commanded in  the rear, finding in his way such of the men as had fallen down with it,  knew not what disease it was. But as one of these acquainted with it  told him that they were evidently affected with bulimia, and that they  would get up if they had something to eat, he went round among the  baggage and wherever he saw anything eatable he gave it out, and sent  such as were able to run to distribute it among those diseased, who, as  soon as they had eaten, rose up and continued their march. As they  proceeded, Chirisophus came, just as it grew dark, to a village, and  found, at a spring in front of the rampart, some women and girls  belonging to the place fetching water. The women asked them who they  were, and the interpreter answered, in the Persian language, that they  were people going from the king to the satrap. They replied that he was  not there, but about a parasang off.    [Footnote 28: Spelman quotes a description of the bulimia from Galen, in  which it is said to be \"a disease in which the patient frequently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#19)"],[1,"an admixture of it. It possesses the valuable  property of being welded by hammering; and hence its adaptation to the  numerous purposes of civilized life.        Metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries, and a      twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to      consist of this metal. Blood owes its colour of redness to the      quantity of iron it contains, and rain and snow are seldom      perfectly free from it. In the arts it is employed in three      states,--as _cast_ iron, _wrought_ iron, and _steel_. In each of      these it largely enters into the domestic economy, and stoves,      grates, and the general implements of cookery, are usually      composed of it. In antiquity, its employment was, comparatively      speaking, equally universal. The excavations made at Pompeii      have proved this. The accompanying cuts present us with      specimens of stoves, both ancient and modern. Fig. 2 is the      remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of Pansa, at      Pompeii, and would seem, in its perfect state, not to have been      materially different from such as are in use at the present day.      Fig. 3 is a self-acting, simple open range in modern use, and      may be had of two qualities, ranging, according to their      dimensions, from L3. 10s. and L3. 18s. respectively, up to L4.      10s. and L7. 5s. They are completely fitted up with oven,      boiler, sliding cheek, wrought-iron bars, revolving shelves, and      brass tap. Fig. 4, is called the Improved Leamington Kitchener,      and is said to surpass any other range in use, for easy cooking      by one fire. It has a hot plate, which is well calculated for an      ironing-stove, and on which as many vessels as will stand upon      it, may be kept boiling, without being either soiled or injured.      Besides, it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wrought-iron      roaster, with movable shelves, draw-out stand, double      dripping-pan, and meat-stand. The roaster can be converted into      an oven by closing the valves, when bread and pastry can be      baked in it in a superior manner. It also has a large iron      boiler with brass tap and steam-pipe, round and square gridirons      for chops and steaks, ash-pan, open fire for roasting, and a set      of ornamental covings with plate-warmer attached. It took a      first-class prize and medal in the Great Exhibition of 1851, and      was also exhibited, with all the recent improvements, at the      Dublin Exhibition in 1853. Fig. 5 is another kitchener, adapted      for large families. It has on the one side, a large ventilated      oven; and on the other, the fire and roaster. The hot plate is      over all, and there is a back boiler, made of wrought iron, with      brass tap and steam-pipe. In other respects it resembles Fig. 4,      with which it possesses similar advantages of construction.      Either maybe had at varying prices, according to size, from L5.      15s. up to L23. 10s. They are supplied by Messrs. Richard & John      Slack 336, Strand, London.    [Illustration: _Fig_. 2.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 3.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 4.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 5.]    66. FROM KITCHEN RANGES to the implements used in cookery is but a step.  With these, every kitchen should be well supplied, otherwise the cook  must not be expected to \"perform her office\" in a satisfactory manner.  Of the culinary utensils of the ancients, our knowledge is very limited;  but as the art of living, in every civilized country, is pretty much the  same, the instruments for cooking must, in a great degree, bear a  striking resemblance to each other. On referring to classical  antiquities, we find mentioned, among household utensils, leather bags,  baskets constructed of twigs, reeds, and rushes; boxes, basins, and  bellows; bread-moulds, brooms, and brushes; caldrons, colanders,  cisterns, and chafing-dishes; cheese-rasps, knives, and ovens of the  Dutch kind; funnels and frying-pans; handmills, soup-ladles, milk-pails,  and oil-jars; presses, scales, and sieves; spits of different sizes, but  some of them large enough to roast an ox; spoons, fire-tongs, trays,  trenchers, and drinking-vessels; with others for carrying food,  preserving milk, and holding cheese. This enumeration, if it does  nothing else, will, to some extent, indicate the state of the simpler  kinds of mechanical arts among the ancients.    [Illustration: _Fig_. 6.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 7.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 8.]        In so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the      kitchen utensils enumerated above, they bore a great resemblance      to our own. This will be seen by the accompanying cuts. Fig. 6      is an ancient stock-pot in bronze, which seems to have been made      to hang over the fire, and was found in the buried city of      Pompeii. Fig. 7 is one of modern make, and may be obtained      either of copper or wrought iron, tinned inside. Fig. 8 is      another of antiquity, with a large ladle and colander, with      holes attached. It is taken from the column of Trajan. The      modern ones can be obtained at all prices, according to size,      from 13s. 6d. up to L1. 1s.    67. IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE UTENSILS, bronze metal seems to have  been much in favour with the ancients. It was chosen not only for their  domestic vessels, but it was also much used for their public sculptures  and medals. It is a compound, composed of from six to twelve parts of  tin to one hundred of copper. It gives its name to figures and all  pieces of sculpture made of it. Brass was another favourite metal, which  is composed of copper and zinc. It is more fusible than copper, and not  so apt to tarnish. In a pure state it is not malleable, unless when hot,  and after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer. To  render it capable of being wrought, it requires 7 lb. of lead to be put  to 1 cwt. of its own material.        The Corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver, gold,      and copper. A fine kind of brass, supposed to be made by the      cementation of copper plates with calamine, is, in Germany,      hammered out into leaves, and is called Dutch metal in this      country. It is employed in the same way as gold leaf. Brass is      much used for watchworks, as well as for wire.    68. The braziers, ladles, stewpans, saucepans, gridirons, and colanders  of antiquity might generally pass for those of the English manufacture  of the present day, in so far as shape is concerned. In proof of this we  have placed together the following similar articles of ancient and  modern pattern, in order that the reader may, at a single view, see  wherein any difference that is between them, consists.    [Illustration: _Fig_. 9. Modern.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 10. Ancient.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 11. Modern.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 12. Ancient.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 13. Modern.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 14. Ancient.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 15. Modern.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 16. Modern.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 17. Ancient.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 18. Ancient.]        _Figs_. 9 and 10 are flat sauce or _saute_ pans, the ancient one      being fluted in the handle, and having at the end a ram's head.      Figs. 11 and 12 are colanders, the handle of the ancient one      being adorned, in the original, with carved representations of a      cornucopia, a satyr, a goat, pigs, and other animals. Any      display of taste in the adornment of such utensils, might seem      to be useless; but when we remember how much more natural it is      for us all to be careful of the beautiful and costly, than of      the plain and cheap, it may even become a question in the      economy of a kitchen, whether it would not, in the long run, be      cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity      in their manufacture, than such as are so perfectly plain as to      have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to      the purposes for which they are made. Figs. 13 and 14 are      saucepans, the ancient one being of bronze, originally copied      from the cabinet of M. l'Abbe Charlet, and engraved in the      Antiquities of Montfaucon. Figs. 15 and 17 are gridirons, and 16      and 18 dripping-pans. In all these utensils the resemblance      between such as were in use 2,000 years ago, and those in use at      the present day, is strikingly manifest.    69. SOME OF THE ANCIENT UTENSILS represented in the above cuts, are  copied from those found amid the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii. These  Roman cities were, in the first century, buried beneath the lava of an  eruption of Vesuvius, and continued to be lost to the world till the  beginning of the last century, when a peasant, in digging for a well,  gradually discovered a small temple with some statues. Little notice,  however, was taken of this circumstance till 1736, when the king of  Naples, desiring to erect a palace at Portici, caused extensive  excavations to be made, when the city of Herculaneum was slowly unfolded  to view. Pompeii was discovered about 1750, and being easier cleared  from the lava in which it had so long been entombed, disclosed itself as  it existed immediately before the catastrophe which overwhelmed it,  nearly two thousand years ago. It presented, to the modern world, the  perfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient Roman city. The  interior of its habitations, shops, baths, theatres, and temples, were  all disclosed, with many of the implements used by the workmen in their  various trades, and the materials on which they were employed, when the  doomed city was covered with the lavian stream.    70. AMONGST THE MOST ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS of the kitchen are scales or  weighing-machines for family use. These are found to have existed among  the ancients, and must, at a very early age, have been both publicly and  privately employed for "]]]
