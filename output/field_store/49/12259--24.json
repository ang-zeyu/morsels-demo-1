He grins a good-humoured grin as he  reads--poor old Bill is just as thick-headed and obstinate as ever--just  as far gone on his old fad. It's rather rough on Jim, because he's too  far off to argue; but, if he's very earnest on the subject, he'll sit  down and write, using all his old arguments to prove that the man who  wrote that rot was a fool. This is one of the few things that will make  them write to each other. Or else Jim will wait till he comes across a  paragraph in another paper which barracks for his side of the argument,  and, in his opinion; rather knocks the stuffing out of Bill's man; then  he marks it with more and bigger crosses and a grin, and sends it along  to Bill. They are both democrats--these old mates generally are--and  at times one comes across a stirring article or poem, and marks it with  approval and sends it along. Or it may be a good joke, or the notice of  the death of an old mate. What a wave of feeling and memories a little  par can take through the land!    Jim is a sinner and a scoffer, and Bill is an earnest, thorough,  respectable old freethinker, and consequently they often get a _War Cry_  or a tract sent inside their exchanges--somebody puts it in for a joke.    Long years ago--long years ago Bill and Jim were sweet on a rose of the  bush--or a lily of the goldfields--call her Lily King. Both courted her  at the same time, and quarrelled over her--fought over her, perhaps--and  were parted by her for years. But that's all bygones. Perhaps she loved  Bill, perhaps she loved Jim--perhaps both; or, maybe, she wasn't sure  which. Perhaps she loved neither, and was only stringing them on.  Anyway, she didn't marry either the one or the other. She married  another man--call him Jim Smith. And so, in after years, Bill comes  across a paragraph in a local paper, something like the following:        On July 10th, at her residence, Eureka Cottage, Ballarat-street,      Tally Town, the wife of James Smith of twins (boy and girl);      all three doing well.    And Bill marks it with a loud chuckle and big crosses, and sends it  along to Jim. Then Bill sits and thinks and smokes, and thinks till the  fire goes out, and quite forgets all about putting that necessary patch  on his pants.    And away down on Auckland gum-fields, perhaps, Jim reads the par with a  grin; then grows serious, and sits and scrapes his gum by the flickering  firelight in a mechanical manner, and--thinks. His thoughts are far away  in the back years--faint and far, far and faint. For the old, lingering,  banished pain returns and hurts a man's heart like the false wife  who comes back again, falls on her knees before him, and holds up  her trembling arms and pleads with swimming, upturned eyes, which are  eloquent with the love she felt too late.    It is supposed to be something to have your work published in an English  magazine, to have it published in book form, to be flattered by critics  and reprinted throughout the country press, or even to be cut up well  and severely. But, after all, now we come to think of it, we would  almost as soon see a piece of ours marked with big inky crosses in the  soiled and crumpled rag that Bill or Jim gets sent him by an old mate  of his--the paper that goes thousands of miles scrawled all over with  smudgy addresses and tied with a piece of string.          MITCHELL DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE SACK        \"If ever I do get a job again,\" said Mitchell, \"I'll stick to it while  there's a hand's turn of work to do, and put a few pounds together. I  won't be the fool I always was. If I'd had sense a couple of years ago,  I wouldn't be tramping through this damned sand and mulga now. I'll get  a job on a station, or at some toff's house, knocking about the stables  and garden, and I'll make up my mind to settle down to graft for four or  five years.\"    \"But supposing you git the sack?\" said his mate.    \"I won't take it. Only for taking the sack I wouldn't be hard up to-day.  The boss might come round and say:    'I won't want you after this week, Mitchell. I haven't got any more work  for you to do. Come up and see me at the office presently.'    \"So I'll go up and get my money; but I'll be pottering round as usual  on Monday, and come up to the kitchen for my breakfast. Some time in the  day the boss'll be knocking round and see me.    \"'Why, Mitchell,' he'll say, 'I thought you was gone.'    \"'I didn't say I was going,' I'll say. 'Who told you that--or what made  you think so?'    \"'I thought I told you on Saturday that I wouldn't want you any more,'  he'll say, a bit short. 'I haven't got enough work to keep a man going;  I told you that; I thought you understood. _Didn't I give you the sack  on Saturday_?'    \"'It's no use;' I'll say, 'that sort of thing's played out. I've been  had too often that way; I've been sacked once too often. Taking the  sack's been the cause of all my trouble; I don't believe in it. If I'd  never taken the sack I'd have been a rich man to-day; it might be all  very well for horses, but it doesn't suit me; it doesn't hurt you, but  it hurts me. I made up my mind that when I got a place to suit me, I'd  stick in it. I'm comfortable here and satisfied, and you've had no cause  to find fault with me. It's no use you trying to sack me, because I  won't take it. I've been there before, and you might as well try to  catch an old bird with chaff.'    \"'Well, I won't pay you, and you'd better be off,' he'll say, trying not  to grin.    \"'Never mind the money,' I'll say, 'the bit of tucker won't cost you  anything, and I'll find something to do round the house till you have  some more work. I won't ask you for anything, and, surely to God I'll  find enough to do to pay for my grub!'    \"So I'll potter round and take things easy and call up at the kitchen as  usual at meal times, and by and by the boss'll think to himself: 'Well,  if I've got to feed this chap I might as well get some work out of him.'    \"So he'll find me, something regular to do--a bit of fencing, or  carpentering, or painting, or something, and then I'll begin to call up  for my stuff again, as usual.\"           SHOOTING THE MOON        We lay in camp in the fringe of the mulga, and watched the big, red,  smoky, rising moon out on the edge of the misty plain, and smoked and  thought together sociably. Our nose-bags were nice and heavy, and we  still had about a pound of nail-rod between us.    The moon reminded my mate, Jack Mitchell, of something--anything  reminded him of something, in fact.    \"Did you ever notice,\" said Jack, in a lazy tone, just as if he didn't  want to tell a yarn--\"Did you ever notice that people always shoot the  moon when there's no moon? Have you got the matches?\"    He lit up; he was always lighting up when he was reminded of something.    \"This reminds me--Have you got the knife? My pipe's stuffed up.\"    He dug it out, loaded afresh, and lit up again.    \"I remember once, at a pub I was staying at, I had to leave without  saying good-bye to the landlord. I didn't know him very well at that  time.    \"My room was upstairs at the back, with the window opening on to  the backyard. I always carried a bit of clothes-line in my swag or  portmanteau those times. I travelled along with a portmanteau those  times. I carried the rope in case of accident, or in case of fire, to  lower my things out of the window--or hang myself, maybe, if things got  too bad. No, now I come to think of it, I carried a revolver for that,  and it was the only thing I never pawned.\"    \"To hang yourself with?\" asked the mate.    \"Yes--you're very smart,\" snapped Mitchell; \"never mind---. This reminds  me that I got a chap at a pub to pawn my last suit, while I stopped  inside and waited for an old mate to send me a pound; but I kept the  shooter, and if he hadn't sent it I'd have been the late John Mitchell  long ago.\"    \"And sometimes you lower'd out when there wasn't a fire.\"    \"Yes, that will pass; you're improving in the funny business. But about  the yarn. There was two beds in my room at the pub, where I had to go  away without shouting for the boss, and, as it happened, there was a  strange chap sleeping in the other bed that night, and, just as I raised  the window and was going to lower my bag out, he woke up.    \"'Now, look here,' I said, shaking my fist at him, like that, 'if you  say a word, I'll stoush yer!'    \"'Well,' he said, 'well, you needn't be in such a sweat to jump down a  man's throat. I've got my swag under the bed, and I was just going to  ask you for the loan of the rope when you're done with it.'    \"Well, we chummed. His name was Tom--Tom--something, I forget the other  name, but it doesn't matter. Have you got the matches?\"    He wasted three matches, and continued--    \"There was a lot of old galvanized iron lying about under the window,  and I was frightened the swag would make a noise; anyway, I'd have to  drop the rope, and that was sure to make a noise. So we agreed for one  of us to go down and land the swag. If we were seen going down without  the swags it didn't matter, for we could say we wanted to go out in the  yard for something.\"    \"If you had the swag you might pretend you were walking in your sleep,\"  I suggested, for the want of something funnier to say.    \"Bosh,\" said Jack, \"and get woke up with a black eye. Bushies don't  generally carry their swags out of pubs in their sleep, or walk neither;  it's only city swells who do that. Where's the blessed matches?    \"Well, Tom agreed to go, and presently I saw a shadow under the window,  and lowered away.    \"'All right?' I asked in a whisper.    \"'All right!\" whispered the shadow.    \"I lowered the other swag.    \"'All right?'    \"'All right!' said the shadow, and just then the moon came out.    \"'All right!' says the shadow.    \"But it wasn't all right. It was the landlord himself!    \"It seems he got up and went out to the back in the night, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#18)"],[1,"in the predicate, and then  transpose, placing these words wherever they can properly go_:--    Mountains, glad, by and by.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 53.
