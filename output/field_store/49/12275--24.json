The steward who waited on him, McGuire, from London,  says Mr. Ismay came dashing into the dining room, and throwing himself  in a chair, said: 'Hurry, for God's sake, and get me something to eat;  I'm starved. I don't care what it costs or what it is; bring it to me.'    \"McGuire brought Mr. Ismay a load of stuff and when he had finished  it, he handed McGuire a two dollar bill. 'Your money is no good on this  ship,' McGuire told him. 'Take it.'      {illust. caption = DIAGRAM OF THE TITANIC'S ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT    The Titanic was far and away the largest and finest vessel ever built,  excepting only her sister-ship, the Olympic. Her dimensions were:  Length, 882 1/2 feet; Beam, 92 feet, Depth (from keel to tops of  funnels), 175 feet Tonnage, 45,000. Her huge hull, divided into thirty  watertight compartments, contained nine steel decks, and provided  accommodation for 2,500 passengers, besides a crew of 890.}    {illust. caption = UPPER DECK OF THE TITANIC, LOOKING FORWARD}      insisted Mr. Ismay, shoving the bill in McGuire's hand. I am well able  to afford it. I will see to it that the boys of the Carpathia are well  rewarded for this night's work.' This promise started McGuire making  inquiries as to the identity of the man he had waited on. Then we  learned that he was Mr. Ismay. I did not see Mr. Ismay after the first  few hours. He must have kept to his cabin.\"    A passenger on the Carpathia said there was no wonder that none of the  wireless telegrams addressed to Mr. Ismay were answered until the one  that he sent yesterday afternoon to his line, the White Star.    \"Mr. Ismay was beside himself,\" said this woman passenger, \"and on  most of the voyage after we had picked him up he was being quieted with  opiates on orders of the ship's doctor.      FIVE DOGS AND ONE PIG SAVED    \"Five women saved their pet dogs, carrying them in their arms. Another  woman saved a little pig, which she said was her mascot. Though her  husband is an Englishman and she lives in England she is an American and  was on her way to visit her folks here. How she cared for the pig aboard  ship I do not know, but she carried it up the side of the ship in a big  bag. I did not mind the dogs so much, but it seemed to me to be too much  when a pig was saved and human beings went to death.    \"It was not until noon on Monday that we cleared the last of the ice,  and Monday night a dense fog came up and continued until the following  morning, then a strong wind, a heavy sea, a thunderstorm and a dense fog  Tuesday night, caused some uneasiness among the more unnerved, the fog  continuing all of Tuesday.    \"A number of whales were sighted as the Carpathia was clearing the last  of the ice, one large one being close by, and all were spouting like  geysers.\"      VOTE OF THANKS TO CARPATHIA    \"On Tuesday afternoon a meeting of the uninjured survivors was called in  the main saloon for the purpose of devising means of assisting the more  unfortunate, many of whom had lost relatives and all their personal  belongings, and thanking Divine Providence for their deliverance.  The meeting was called to order and Mr. Samuel Goldenberg was elected  chairman. Resolutions were then passed thanking the officers, surgeons,  passengers and crew of the Carpathia for their splendid services in  aiding the rescued and like resolutions for the admirable work done by  the officers, surgeons and crew of the Titanic.    \"A committee was then appointed to raise funds on board the Carpathia to  relieve the immediate wants of the destitute and assist them in reaching  their destinations and also to present a loving cup to the officers of  the Carpathia and also a loving cup to the surviving officers of the  Titanic.    \"Mr. T. G. Frauenthal, of New York, was made chairman of the Committee  on Subscriptions.    \"A committee, consisting of Mrs. J. J. Brown, Mrs William Bucknell and  Mrs. George Stone, was appointed to look after the destitute. There  was a subscription taken up and up to Wednesday the amount contributed  totaled $15,000.    \"The work of the crew on board the Carpathia in rescuing was most noble  and remarkable, and these four days that the ship has been overcrowded  with its 710 extra passengers could not have been better handled. The  stewards have worked with undying strength--although one was overcome  with so much work and died and was put to his grave at sea.    \"I have never seen or felt the benefits of such royal treatment. I have  heard the captain criticised because he did not answer telegrams, but  all that I can say is that he showed us every possible courtesy, and if  we had been on our own boats, having paid our fares there, we could not  have had better food or better accommodations.    \"Men who had paid for the best staterooms on the Carpathia left their  rooms so that we might have them. They fixed up beds in the smoking  rooms, and mattresses everywhere. All the women who were rescued  were given the best staterooms, which were surrendered by the regular  passengers. None of the regular passengers grumbled because their trip  to Europe was interrupted, nor did they complain that they were put to  the inconvenience of receiving hundreds of strangers.    \"The women on board the Carpathia were particularly kind. It shows that  for every cruelty of nature there is a kindness, for every misfortune  there is some goodness. The men and women took up collections on board  for the rescued steerage passengers. Mrs. Astor, I believe, contributed  $2000, her check being cashed by the Carpathia. Altogether something  like $15,000 was collected and all the women were provided with  sufficient money to reach their destination after they were landed in  New York.\"    Under any other circumstances the suffering would have been intolerable.  But the Good Samaritans on the Carpathia gave many women heart's-ease.    The spectacle on board the Carpathia on the return trip to New York at  times was heartrending, while at other times those on board were quite  cheerful.        CHAPTER XI. PREPARATIONS ON LAND TO RECEIVE THE SUFFERERS    POLICE ARRANGEMENTS--DONATIONS OF MONEY AND SUPPLIES--HOSPITALS AND  AMBULANCES MADE READY--PRIVATE HOUSES THROWN OPEN--WAITING FOR THE  CARPATHIA TO ARRIVE--THE SHIP SIGHTED!    NEW YORK CITY, touched to the heart by the great ocean calamity and  desiring to do what it could to lighten the woes and relieve the  sufferings of the pitiful little band of men and women rescued from the  Titanic, opened both its heart and its purse.    The most careful and systematic plans were made for the reception and  transfer to homes, hotels or institutions of the Titanic's survivors.  Mayor Gaynor, with Police Commissioner Waldo, arranged to go down the  bay on the police boat Patrol, to come up with the Carpathia and take  charge of the police arrangements at the pier.    In anticipation of the enormous number that would, for a variety of  reasons, creditable or otherwise, surge about the Cunard pier at the  coming of the Carpathia, Mayor Gaynor and the police commissioner had  seen to it that the streets should be rigidly sentineled by continuous  lines of policemen Under Inspector George McClusky, the man of most  experience, perhaps, in handling large crowds, there were 200 men,  including twelve mounted men and a number in citizens' clothes. For two  blocks to the north, south and east of the docks lines were established  through which none save those bearing passes from the Government and the  Cunard Line could penetrate.    With all arrangements made that experience or information could suggest,  the authorities settled down to await the docking of the Carpathia. No  word had come to either the White Star Line or the Cunard Line, they  said, that any of the Titanic's people had died on that ship or that  bodies had been recovered from the sea, but in the afternoon Mayor  Gaynor sent word to the Board of Coroners that it might be well for  some of that body to meet the incoming ship. Coroners Feinberg and  Holtzhauser with Coroner's Physician Weston arranged to go down the  bay on the Patrol, while Coroner Hellenstein waited at the pier. An  undertaker was notified to be ready if needed. Fortunately there was no  such need.      EVERY POSSIBLE MEASURE THOUGHT OF    Every possible measure of relief for the survivors that could be thought  of by officials of the city, of the Federal Government, by the heads of  hospitals and the Red Cross and relief societies was arranged for.  The Municipal Lodging House, which has accommodations for 700 persons,  agreed to throw open its doors and furnish lodging and food to any of  the survivors as long as they should need it. Commissioner of Charities  Drummond did not know, of course, just how great the call would be for  the services of his department. He went to the Cunard pier to direct his  part of the work in person. Meanwhile he had twenty ambulances ready  for instant movement on the city's pier at the foot of East Twenty-sixth  Street. They were ready to take patients to the reception hospital  connected with Bellevue or the Metropolitan Hospital on Blackwell's  Island. Ambulances from the Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn were also  there to do their share. All the other hospitals in the city stood ready  to take the Titanic's people and those that had ambulances promised to  send them. The Charities ferryboat, Thomas S. Brennan, equipped as a  hospital craft, lay off the department pier with nurses and physicians  ready to be called to the Cunard pier on the other side of the city.  St. Vincent's Hospital had 120 beds ready, New York Hospital twelve,  Bellevue and the reception hospital 120 and Flower Hospital twelve.

Mavis, as the diplomatic  widow, with grey hair and tortoise-shell-rimmed spectacles, looked at  least fifty, and preserved her disguise admirably. As for Merle, not a  soul in the audience would have recognised her as Augustus. She wore  Clive's Eton suit and overcoat, had a brown wig and a moustache, and  affected a deep-toned fashionable drawl. Clive, arrayed in some of Mrs.  Ramsay's garments, with a hat and veil and a fur, looked a thorough  member of the smart set and acted the most modern of modern damsels. He  entered, affectionately leaning on the arm of Augustus, and almost  embarrassed that youth by his attentions.    Bevis, as Uncle Cashbags, with white hair, long beard, false eyebrows,  and a gouty foot, came limping on to the stage, and was received with  effusion by the widow and Augustus, and especially by Isabella, who was a  minx, and set herself to captivate the old gentleman. In vain the  luckless Augustus tried to ingratiate himself with his rich relation; he  was unfortunate enough to tumble over the gouty leg and make several  other most exasperating mistakes, which ended in Uncle Cashbags  wrathfully repudiating him as his heir, and announcing his intention of  marrying Isabella himself, finally hobbling away with the fair and  faithless damsel clinging fondly to his arm and blowing a good-bye kiss  to her former fiancé.    Mischievous Clive was in his element, and played the part with such  tremendous zeal that the audience, who had not yet grasped his youth and  his sex, watched his manoeuvres breathlessly, and several old ladies  looked quite scandalised and disapproving. It was only when called before  the curtain that, at a whisper from Mavis, he pulled off hat and veil,  revealing his unmistakably boyish head, whereupon a great shout of  laughter arose from the benches and a perfect storm of applause.    \"It has been capital! Capital!\" said Mrs. Glyn Williams. \"One of the best  entertainments we've ever had at the Institute! Didn't Babbie look sweet  as 'Sophia'? We must have some more tableaux another time. Gwen, you  ought to have been in too! The Castletons were splendid! Such a number of  nice young people here! We ought to have a little dance. They must all  come up to The Warren to-morrow evening, and we'll clear the drawing-room.  I'll telephone to Dr. Tremayne and say I'm keeping you four till  Friday. Your dresses? Oh, we'll send over for them. I'm sure your Mother  won't mind your staying!\"    There was no possibility of refusal, for Mrs. Glyn Williams had quite  settled the matter, and invited the Castletons and the Macleods and the  Colvilles and several other people on the spot. The Ramsays, who had made  plans of their own for the following evening, felt a little caught,  especially as Bevis looked glum and reproachful.    \"How _could_ you?\" he said to Mavis in an agonized whisper.    \"How could I help it?\"    \"We were shot sitting,\" murmured Merle. \"Cheer up, Bevis! A dance is a  dance, anyway. I hope I haven't spoilt Clive's Etons for him!\"    Mrs. Glyn Williams really meant to be very kind and to give the young  people pleasure, and if Bevis did not entirely appreciate her hospitality  it was no doubt his own fault. The fact was that the snubs which he had  received as Bevis Hunter still rankled, and though as Bevis Talland he  was on a very different footing, he found it difficult entirely to forget  all that had gone before.    \"I was exactly the same as I am now, but no one would notice me till I  came into the estate--except you and Merle!\" he said once rather bitterly  to Mavis. \"I sometimes feel their friendship is hardly worth having!\"    \"It's the way of the world, and you have to take people just as they  are,\" she replied. \"It's no use keeping up ill-feeling, Bevis. If they  hold out the olive branch, it's more gracious to accept it, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, I'll behave myself! But all the same, I discriminate between my old  friends and my new acquaintances; I'd rather not call them by the name of  friends!\"    There were great preparations next day at The Warren. The furniture was  carried out of the drawing-room, the parquet floor was polished, and  Chinese lanterns were hung up in the conservatory, and the cook was busy  preparing light refreshments. It was a pretty house for a dance, and  looked very gay and festive with its Christmas decorations of holly and  ivy, and its blazing fire of logs in the hall. Mavis's and Merle's party  dresses duly arrived, and they made careful toilets, coming downstairs  shyly, to feel a little in the shade by the side of Gwen the magnificent,  who, alack! was trying to copy the up-to-date manners of some of her new  school friends, with rather unhappy results. Perhaps kind little Babbie  noticed the Ramsays' embarrassment, for she went to them at once to give  them their programmes.    \"How nice you look!\" she said. \"Isn't it always a horrid time, just when  every one is arriving? It's ever so much nicer when the first dance has  started!\"    There were a great many people present whom Mavis and Merle did not know.  Some of these were introduced by Tudor, and asked for dances, and very  soon the sisters were separated and gliding over the polished floor with  partners.    Mrs. Glyn Williams, having welcomed the young guests, retired to a sofa  for a chat with some other dowagers, and left them to fill up their  programmes as they liked. There were far more ladies present than  gentlemen, so it was a case of girls dancing with one another. Merle  readily whisked away with Tattie, or Nan, or Lizzie, but shy Mavis, after  the first two-step, stood in a corner unnoticed. Gwen was enjoying  herself very much with the pick of the partners, Beata and Romola floated  by together, and Clive was carefully performing his steps in company with  a much amused married lady. Mavis acted wallflower for several dances,  feeling considerably out of it, till Bevis's voice sounded suddenly in  her ear.    \"Why, here you are! I've been looking for you everywhere! How many dances  can you give me? I've kept my programme as free as I could till I found  you. I thought the pixies must have spirited you away! What did you say?  I ought to ask Gwen? It isn't necessary in the least. You know I'm a  duffer at it, and I should probably tread on her toes and she'd hate me  for evermore. May I have these four?\"    \"Give half to Merle!\"    \"Soeurette's perfectly happy with the kids! If you won't let me have them  I won't dance at all. I'll hide in the conservatory, or run away into the  garden. You promised to be my teacher!\"    \"So I will, but I feel I mustn't monopolise you. Oh, dear! Well, if  you've written them down I suppose it will have to be!\"    \"May I have the pleasure, Miss Ramsay?\" twinkled Bevis, offering his arm.    \"Thanks very much! You may!\" laughed Mavis.    \"I'm always glad when I get my own way!\" chuckled Bevis, as they started  a valse.    Three of the dances which Bevis had appropriated on Mavis's programme  came in succession, and as their steps went well together they thoroughly  enjoyed themselves. At the close of the third they were walking into the  hall to get lemonade when Mrs. Glyn Williams smilingly stopped them.    \"I want to introduce you to some fresh partners. There are plenty of  people anxious to know you!\" she said to Bevis archly. Then, tapping  Mavis with her fan, she continued, laughing, \"Naughty girl! You mustn't  keep him _all_ to yourself! I really _can't!_ allow it!\"    Poor Mavis blushed magenta, and stood aside while her hostess whisked the  unwilling Bevis away and remorselessly fixed up the rest of his programme  for him. She did not attempt to find a partner for Mavis, who was too  overwhelmed with confusion to care to dance even with Lizzie Colville,  and who backed towards the piano and began to turn over the music.  Inwardly Mavis was raging, though she had sufficient pride to preserve an  outward calm.    \"If there's anything here you know I'd be grateful if you could play it  and give me a rest, my hands are so stiff,\" said Mrs. Colville, who had  volunteered to act as pianist for the evening.    \"I'll try with pleasure!\" answered Mavis, taking her place.    She was glad to have an excuse for not dancing. She only wished she could  have run away from The Warren and gone straight home and poured out her  troubles to her mother. The Glyn Williams had cut Bevis in the old days  and poured scorn on the Ramsays for knowing him, and it seemed too bad  that their present hospitality to him should still be a subject for  blame. Mavis's pride kept her at the piano all the rest of the evening.  She was a good reader, and assured Mrs. Colville that she liked playing.  She shook her head when Bevis came for his fourth dance.    \"_Please_ get another partner! I'm busy here! Mrs. Glyn Williams  will find you somebody!\"    Whereupon Bevis, muttering very uncomplimentary remarks about his hostess  under his breath, deliberately passed by several eligible wallflowers,  chose out the youngest child in the room, and led her off in a valse.    Merle, who was still an absolute schoolgirl and revelled in anything in  the nature of a party, enjoyed her evening supremely. Mavis was very glad  when it was all over and she was quiet in bed. Some new element seemed to  have entered to-night into her old happy world and to have rubbed the  bloom off her innocent friendship with Bevis.    \"It was so jolly in the old days when we hunted for primroses and had  picnics in Blackthorn Bower!\" she thought. \"It's not ourselves who have  changed, but other people who won't allow us to be the same. Why couldn't  things go on as they were? If this is society I don't like it! Oh, dear!  I wish we could always stay exactly as we are and never grow up at all!\"          CHAPTER X    The Mumps      When the Christmas holidays were over, a very important decision was  arrived at with regard to Clive.
