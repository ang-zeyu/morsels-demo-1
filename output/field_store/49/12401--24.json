What scars?\"    \"Ain't you noticed 'em.\"    It was bedtime, so Ronicky Doone took off his coat and shirt. The  rounded body, alive with playing muscles, was striped, here and there,  with white streaks--scars left by healed wounds.    \"At your age? A kid like you with scars?\" Bill Gregg had been asking,  and then he saw the exposed scars and gasped. \"How come, Ronicky,\" he  asked huskily in his astonishment, \"that you got all those and ain't  dead yet?\"    \"I dunno,\" said the other. \"I wonder a pile about that, myself. Fact is  I'm a lucky gent, Bill Gregg.\"    \"They say back yonder in your country that you ain't never been beaten,  Ronicky.\"    \"They sure say a lot of foolish things, just to hear themselves talk,  partner. A gent gets pretty good with a gun, then they say he's the best  that ever breathed--that he's never been beat. But they forget things  that happened just a year back. No, sir; I sure took my lickings when I  started.\"    \"But, dog-gone it, Ronicky, you ain't twenty-four now!\"    \"Between sixteen and twenty-two I spent a pile of time in bed, Bill, and  you can lay to that!\"    \"And you kept practicing?\"    \"Sure, when I found out that I had to. I never liked shooting much.  Hated to think of having a gent's life right inside the crook of my  trigger finger. But, when I seen that I had to get good, why I just let  go all holds and practiced day and night. And I still got to practice.\"    \"I seen that,\" said Bill Gregg. \"Every day, for an hour or two, you work  with your guns.\"    \"It's like being a musician,\" said Ronicky without enthusiasm. \"I heard  about it once. Suppose a gent works up to be a fine musician, maybe at  the piano. You'd think, when he got to the top and knew everything, he  could lay off and take things easy the rest of his life. But not him!  Nope, he's got to work like a slave every day.\"    \"But how come you felt them scars pricking as a bad-luck sign, Ronicky?\"  he asked after a time. \"Is there anything that's gone wrong, far as you  see?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky gravely. \"Maybe not, and maybe so. I ain't a  prophet, but I don't like having everything so smooth--not when they's a  gent like the man with the sneer on the other end of the wire. It means  he's holding back some cards on us, and I'd sure like to see the color  of what he's got. What I'm going to work for is this, Bill: To get  Caroline's brother, Jerry Smith, and rustle him out of town.\"    \"But how can you do that when John Mark has a hold on him?\"    \"That's a pile of bunk, Bill. I figure Mark is just bluffing. He ain't  going to turn anybody over to the police. Less he has to do with the  police the happier he'll be. You can lay to that. Matter of fact, he's  been loaning money to Caroline's brother. You heard her say that. Also,  he thinks that Mark is the finest and most generous gent that ever  stepped. Probably a selfish skunk of a spoiled kid, this brother of  hers. Most like he puts Mark up as sort of an ideal. Well, the thing to  do is to get hold of him and wake him up and pay off his debts to Mark,  which most like run to several thousand.\"    \"Several thousand, Ronicky? But where'll we get the money?\"    \"You forget that I can always get money. It grows on the bushes for me.\"  He grinned at Bill Gregg.    \"Once we get Jerry Smith, then the whole gang of us will head straight  West, as fast as we can step. Now let's hit the hay.\"    Never had the mind of Ronicky Doone worked more quickly and surely to  the point. The case of Jerry Smith was exactly what he had surmised. As  for the crime of which John Mark knew, and which he held like a club  over Jerry Smith, it had been purely and simply an act of self-defense.  But, to Caroline and her brother, Mark had made it seem clear that the  shadow of the electric chair was before the young fellow.    Mark had worked seriously to win Caroline. She was remarkably dexterous;  she was the soul of courage; and, if he could once make her love her  work, she would make him rich. In the meantime she did very well indeed,  and he strengthened his hold on her through her brother. It was not hard  to do. If Jerry Smith was the soul of recklessness, he was the soul of  honor, also, in many ways. John Mark had only to lead the boy toward a  life of heavy expenditures and gaming, lending him, from time to time,  the wherewithal to keep it up. In this way he anchored Jerry as a  safeguard to windward, in case of trouble.    But, now that Ronicky Doone had entered the tangle, everything was  changed. That clear-eyed fellow might see through to the very bottom of  Mark's tidewater plans. He might step in and cut the Gordian knot by  simply paying off Jerry's debts. Telling the boy to laugh at the danger  of exposure, Doone could snatch him away to the West. So Mark came to  forestall Ronicky, by sending Jerry out of town and out of reach, for  the time being. He would not risk the effect of Ronicky's tongue. Had  not Caroline been persuaded under his very eyes by this strange  Westerner?    Very early the next morning John Mark went straight to the apartment of  his protege. It was his own man, Northup, who answered the bell and  opened the door to him. He had supplied Northup to Jerry Smith,  immediately after Caroline accomplished the lifting of the Larrigan  emeralds. That clever piece of work had proved the worth of the girl and  made it necessary to spare no expense on Jerry. So he had given him the  tried and proven Northup.    The moment he looked into the grinning face of Northup he knew that the  master was not at home, and both the chief and the servant relaxed. They  were friends of too long a term to stand on ceremony.    \"There's no one here?\" asked Mark, as a matter of form.    \"Not a soul--the kid skipped--not a soul in the house.\"    \"Suppose he were to come up behind the door and hear you talk about him  like this, Northup? He's trim you down nicely, eh?\"    \"Him?\" asked Northup, with an eloquent jerk of his hand. \"He's a husky  young brute, but it ain't brute force that I work with.\" He smiled  significantly into the face of the other, and John Mark smiled in  return. They understood one another perfectly.    \"When is he coming back?\"    \"Didn't leave any word, chief.\"    \"Isn't this earlier than his usual time for starting the day?\"    \"It is, by five hours. The lazy pup don't usually crack an eye till one  in the afternoon.\"    \"What happened this morning.\"    \"Something rare--something it would have done your heart good to see!\"    \"Out with it, Northup.\"    \"I was routed out of bed at eight by a jangling of the telephone. The  operator downstairs said a gentleman was calling on Mr. Smith. I said,  of course, that Mr. Smith couldn't be called on at that hour. Then the  operator said the gentleman would come up to the door and explain. I  told him to come ahead.    \"At the door of the apartment I met as fine looking a youngster as I  ever laid eyes on, brown as a berry, with a quick, straight look about  the eyes that would have done you good to see. No booze or dope in that  face, chief. He said--\"    \"How tall was he?\" asked the chief.    \"About my height. Know him?\"    \"Maybe. What name did he give?\"    \"Didn't give a name. 'I've come to surprise Jerry,' he says to me.    \"'Anybody would surprise Jerry at this hour of the morning,'\" says I.    \"'It's too early, I take it?' says he.    \"'About five hours,' says I.    \"'Then this is going to be one of the exceptions,' says he.    \"'If you knew Jerry better you wouldn't force yourself on him,' says I.    \"'Son,' says this fresh kid--\"    \"Is this the way you talk to Smith?\" broke in Mark.    \"No, I can polish up my lingo with the best of 'em. But this brown-faced  youngster was a card. Son,' he says to me, 'I'll do my own explaining.  Just lead me to his dugout.'    \"I couldn't help laughing. 'You'll get a hot reception,' says I.    \"'I come from a hot country,' says he, 'and I got no doubt that Jerry  will try to make me at home,' and he grinned with a devil in each eye.    \"'Come in, then,' says I, and in he steps. 'And mind your fists,' says  I, 'if you wake him up sudden. He fights sometimes because he has to,  but mostly because it's a pleasure to him.'    \"'Sure,' says he. 'That's the way I like to have 'em come.'\"    \"And he went in?\" demanded John Mark.    \"What's wrong with that?\" asked Northup anxiously.    \"Nothing. Go ahead.\"    \"Well, in he went to Jerry's room. I listened at the door. I heard him  call Jerry, and then Jerry groaned like he was half dead.    \"'I don't know you,' says Jerry.    \"'You will before I'm through with you,' says the other.    \"'Who the devil are you?' asks Jerry.    \"'Doone is my name,' says he.    \"'Then go to the devil till one o'clock,' says Jerry. 'And come back  then if you want to. Here's my time for a beauty sleep.'    \"'If it's that time,' says Doone, 'you'll have to go ugly today. I'm  here to talk.'    \"I heard Jerry sit up in bed.    \"'Now what the devil's the meaning of this?' he asked.    \"'Are you awake?' says Doone.    \"'Yes, but be hung to you!' says Jerry.    \"Don't be hanging me,' says Doone. 'You just mark this day down in  red--it's a lucky one for you, son.'    \"'An' how d'you mean that?' says Jerry, and I could hear by his voice  that he was choking, he was that crazy mad.    \"'Because it's the day you met me,' says Doone; 'that's why it's a lucky  one for you.'    \"'Listen to me,' says Jerry, 'of all the nervy, cold-blooded fakers that  ever stepped you're the nerviest.'    \"'Thanks,' says Doone. 'I think I am doing pretty well.'    \"'If I wanted to waste the time,' says Jerry, 'I'd get up and throw you  out.'    \"'It's a wise man,' says Doone, 'that does his talking from the other  side of a rock.'    \"'Well,' says Jerry, 'd'you think I can't throw you out?'    \"'Anyway,' says Doone, 'I'm still here.'    \"I heard the springs squeal, as Jerry went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11894"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#19)"],[1,"superiors.  Obtaining even the entire world, thy pride never increased! O son of  Pritha, thou ever worshippest Brahmanas, and gods, and the _Pitris_,  with _Swadhas_, and other forms of worship! O son of Pritha, thou hast  ever gratified the Brahmanas by fulfilling every wish of theirs! _Yatis_  and _Sannyasins_ and mendicants of domestic lives have always been fed  in thy house from off plates of gold where I have distributed (food)  amongst them. Unto the _Vanaprasthas_ thou always givest gold and food.  There is nothing in thy house thou mayest not give unto the Brahmanas!  In the _Viswadeva_ sacrifice, that is, for thy peace, performed in thy  house, the things consecrated are first offered unto guests and all  creatures while thou livest thyself with what remaineth (after  distribution)! _Ishtis Pashubandhas_, sacrifices for obtaining fruition  of desire, the religious rites of (ordinary) domesticity, _Paka_  sacrifices, and sacrifices of other kinds, are ever performed in thy  house. Even in this great forest, so solitary and haunted by robbers,  living in exile, divested of thy kingdom, thy virtue hath sustained no  diminution! The _Aswamedha_, the _Rajasuya_, the _Pundarika_, and  _Gosava_, these grand sacrifices requiring large gifts have all been  performed by thee! O monarch, impelled by a perverse sense during that  dire hour of a losing match at dice, thou didst yet stake and lose thy  kingdom, thy wealth, thy weapons, thy brothers, and myself! Simple,  gentle, liberal, modest, truthful, how, O king could thy mind be  attracted to the vice of gambling? I am almost deprived of my sense, O  king, and my heart is overwhelmed with grief, beholding this thy  distress, and this thy calamity! An old history is cited as an  illustration for the truth that men are subjects to the will of God and  never to their own wishes! The Supreme Lord and Ordainer of all  ordaineth everything in respect of the weal and woe, the happiness and  misery, of all creatures, even prior to their births guided by the acts  of each, which are even like a seed (destined to sprout forth into the  tree of life). O hero amongst men, as a wooden doll is made to move its  limbs by the wirepuller, so are creatures made to work by the Lord of  all. O Bharata, like space that covereth every object, God, pervading  every creature, ordaineth its weal or woe. Like a bird tied with a  string, every creature is dependent on God. Every one is subject to God  and none else. No one can be his own ordainer. Like a pearl on its  string, or a bull held fast by the cord passing through its nose, or a  tree fallen from the bank into the middle of the stream, every creature  followeth the command of the Creator, because imbued with His Spirit and  because established in Him. And man himself, dependent on the Universal  Soul, cannot pass a moment independently. Enveloped in darkness,  creatures are not masters of their own weal or woe. They go to heaven or  hell urged by God Himself. Like light straws dependent on strong winds,  all creatures, O Bharatas, are dependent on God! And God himself,  pervading all creatures and engaged in acts right and wrong, moveth in  the universe, though none can say _This is God!_ This body with its  physical attributes is only the means by which God--the Supreme Lord of  all maketh (every creature) to reap fruits that are good or bad. Behold  the power of illusion that hath been spread by God, who confounding with  his illusion, maketh creatures slay their fellows! Truth-knowing _Munis_  behold those differently. They appear to them in a different light, even  like the rays of the Sun (which to ordinary eyes are only a pencil of  light, while to eyes more penetrating seem fraught with the germs of  food and drink). Ordinary men behold the things of the earth otherwise.  It is God who maketh them all, adopting different processes in their  creation and destruction. And, O Yudhishthira, the Self-create Grandsire,  Almighty God, spreading illusion, slayeth his creatures by the  instrumentality of his creatures, as one may break a piece of inert and  senseless wood with wood, or stone with stone, or iron with iron. And  the Supreme Lord, according to his pleasure, sporteth with His  creatures, creating and destroying them, like a child with his toy (of  soft earth). O king, it doth seem to me that God behaveth towards his  creatures like a father or mother unto them. Like a vicious person, He  seemeth to bear himself towards them in anger! Beholding superior and  well-behaved and modest persons persecuted, while the sinful are happy,  I am sorely troubled. Beholding this thy distress and the prosperity of  Suyodhana, I do not speak highly of the Great Ordainer who suffereth  such inequality! O sir, what fruits doth the Great Ordainer reap by  granting prosperity to Dhritarashtra's son who transgresseth the  ordinances, who is crooked and covetous, and who injureth virtue and  religion! If the act done pursueth the doer and none else, then  certainly it is God himself who is stained with the sin of every act. If  however, the sin of an act done doth not attach to the doer, then  (individual) might (and not God) is the true cause of acts, and I grieve  for those that have no might!'\"      SECTION XXXI    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Thy speech, O Yajnaseni, is delightful, smooth and  full of excellent phrases. We have listened to it (carefully). Thou  speakest, however, the language of atheism. O princess, I never act,  solicitous of the fruits of my actions. I give away, because it is my  duty to give; I sacrifice because it is my duty to sacrifice! O Krishna,  I accomplish to the best of my power whatever a person living in  domesticity should do, regardless of the fact whether those acts have  fruits or not. O thou of fair hips, I act virtuously, not from the  desire of reaping the fruits of virtue, but of not transgressing the  ordinances of the Veda, and beholding also the conduct of the good and  wise! My heart, O Krishna, is naturally attracted towards virtue. The  man who wisheth to reap the fruits of virtue is a trader in virtue. His  nature is mean and he should never be counted amongst the virtuous. Nor  doth he ever obtain the fruits of his virtues! Nor doth he of sinful  heart, who having accomplished a virtuous act doubteth in his mind,  obtain the fruits of his act, in consequence of that scepticism of his!  I speak unto thee, under the authority of the Vedas, which constitute  the highest proof in such matters, that never shouldst thou doubt  virtue! The man that doubteth virtue is destined to take his birth in  the brute species. The man of weak understanding who doubteth religion,  virtue or the words of the Rishis, is precluded from regions of  immortality and bliss, like Sudras from the Vedas! O intelligent one, if  a child born of a good race studieth the Vedas and beareth himself  virtuously, royal sages of virtuous behaviour regard him as an aged sage  (not withstanding his years)! The sinful wretch, however, who doubteth  religion and transgresseth the scriptures, is regarded as lower even  than Sudras and robbers! Thou hast seen with thy own eyes the great  ascetic Markandeya of immeasurable soul come to us! It is by virtue  alone that he hath acquired immortality in the flesh. Vyasa, and  Vasistha and Maitreya, and Narada and Lomasa, and Suka, and other Rishis  have all, by virtue alone, become of pure soul! Thou beholdest them with  thy own eyes as furnished with prowess of celestial asceticism,  competent to curse or bless (with effect), and superior to the very  gods! O sinless one, these all, equal to the celestials themselves,  behold with their eyes what is written in the Vedas, and describe virtue  as the foremost duty! It behoveth thee not, therefore, O amiable Queen,  to either doubt or censure God or act, with a foolish heart. The fool  that doubteth religion and disregardeth virtue, proud of the proof  derived from his own reasoning, regardeth not other proofs and holdeth  the Rishis, who are capable of knowing the future as present as mad men.  The fool regardeth only the external world capable of gratifying his  senses, and is blind to everything else. He that doubteth religion hath  no expiation for his offence. That miserable wretch is full of anxiety  and acquireth not regions of bliss hereafter. A rejector of proofs, a  slanderer of the interpretation of the Vedic scriptures, a transgressor  urged by lust and covetousness, that fool goeth to hell. O amiable one,  he on the other hand, who ever cherisheth religion with faith, obtaineth  eternal bliss in the other world. The fool who cherisheth not religion,  transgressing the proofs offered by the Rishis, never obtaineth  prosperity in any life, for such transgression of the scriptures. It is  certain, O handsome one, that with respect to him who regardeth not the  words of the Rishis or the conduct of the virtuous as proof, neither  this nor the other world existeth. Doubt not, O Krishna, the ancient  religion that is practised by the good and framed by Rishis of universal  knowledge and capable of seeing all things! O daughter of Drupada,  religion is the only raft for those desirous of going to heaven, like a  ship to merchants desirous of crossing the ocean. O thou faultless one,  if the virtues that are practised by the virtuous had no fruits, this  universe then would be enveloped in infamous darkness. No one then would  pursue salvation, no one would seek to acquire knowledge nor even  wealth, but men would live like beasts. If asceticism, the austerities  of celibate life, sacrifices, study of the Vedas, charity,  honesty,--these all were fruitless, men would not have practised virtue  generation after generation. If acts were all fruitless, a dire  confusion would ensue. For what then do Rishis and gods and Gandharvas  and Rakshasas who are all independent of human conditions, cherish  virtue with such affection? Knowing it"]]]
