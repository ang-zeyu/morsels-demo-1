Since the Chief Consul has made it his town-residence, this is the  new denomination given to the _Palais des Tuileries_, thus called,  because a tile-kiln formerly stood on the site where it is erected.  At that time, this part of Paris was not comprised within its walls,  nothing was to be seen here, in the vicinity of the tile-kiln, but a  few coppices and scattered habitations.    Catherine de Medicis, wishing to enlarge the capital on this side,  visited the spot, and liking the situation, directed PHILIBERT DE  L'ORME and JEAN BULLAN, two celebrated French architects, to present  her with a plan, from which the construction of this palace was begun  in May 1564. At first, it consisted only of the large square pavilion  in the centre of the two piles of building, which have each a terrace  towards the garden, and of the two pavilions by which they are  terminated.    Henry IV enlarged the original building, and, in 1600, began the  grand gallery which joins it to the _Louvre_, from the plan of DU  CERCEAU. Lewis XIII made some alterations in the palace; and in 1664,  exactly a century from the date of its construction being begun,  Lewis XIV directed LOUIS DE VEAU to finish it, by making the  additions and embellishments which have brought it to its present  state. These deviations from the first plan have destroyed the  proportions required by the strict rules of art; but this defect  would, probably, be overlooked by those who are not connoisseurs, as  the architecture, though variously blended, presents, at first sight,  an _ensemble_ which is magnificent and striking.    The whole front of the palace of the _Tuileries_ consists of five  pavilions, connected by four piles of building, standing on the same  line, and extending for the space of one thousand and eleven feet.  The first order of the three middle piles is Ionic, with encircled  columns. The two adjoining pavilions are also ornamented with Ionic  pillars; but fluted, and embellished with foliage, from the third of  their height to the summit. The second order of these two pavilions  is Corinthian. The two piles of building, which come next, as well as  the two pavilions of the wings, are of a Composite order with fluted  pillars. From a tall iron spindle, placed on the pinnacle of each of  the three principal pavilions is now seen floating a horizontal  tri-coloured streamer. Till the improvements made by Lewis XIV, the  large centre pavilion had been decorated with the Ionic and Corinthian  orders only, to these was added the Composite.    On the façade towards the _Place du Carrousel_, the pillars of all  these orders are of brown and red marble. Here may be observed the  marks of several cannon-balls, beneath each of which is inscribed, in  black, 10 AOÛT.    This tenth of August 1792, a day ever memorable in the history of  France, has furnished many an able writer with the subject of an  episode; but, I believe, few of them were, any more than myself,  actors in that dreadful scene. While I was intently remarking the  particular impression of a shot which struck the edge of one of the  casements of the first floor of the palace, my _valet de place_ came  up to know at which door I would have the carriage remain in waiting.    On turning round, I fancied I beheld the man who \"drew Priam's  curtain in the dead of night.\" That messenger, I am sure, could not  have presented a visage more pale, more spiritless than my Helvetian.  Recollecting that he had served in the Swiss guards, I was the less  at a loss to account for his extreme agitation. \"In what part of the  _château_ were you, Jean,\" said I, \"when these balls were aimed at  the windows?\"----\"There was my post,\" replied he, recovering himself,  and pointing to one of the centre casements.--\"Is it true,\" continued  I, \"that, by way of feigning a reconciliation, you threw down  cartridges by handfuls to the Marseillese below, and called out;  _vive la nation?\"_----\"It is but too true,\" answered Jean; \"we then  availed ourselves of the moment when they advanced under the  persuasion that they were to become our friends, and opened on them a  tremendous fire, by which we covered the place with dead and dying.  But we became victims of our own treachery: for our ammunition being,  by this _ruse de guerre_, the sooner expended, we presently had no  resource left but the bayonet, by which we could not prevent the mob  from closing on us.\"--\"And how did you contrive to escape,\" said I?  --\"Having thrown away my Swiss uniform,\" replied he, \"in the general  confusion, I fortunately possessed myself of the coat of a national  volunteer, which he had taken off on account of the hot weather. This  garment, bespattered with blood, I instantly put on, as well as his  hat with a tri-coloured cockade.\"--\"This disguise saved your life,\"  interrupted I.--\"Yes, indeed;\" rejoined he. \"Having got down to the  vestibule, I could not find a passage into the garden; and, to  prevent suspicion, I at once mixed with the mob on the place where we  are now standing.\"--\"How did you get off at last,\" said I?--\"I was  obliged,\" answered he, \"to shout and swear with the _poissardes_,  while the heads of many of my comrades were thrown out of the  windows.\"--\"The _poissardes_,\" added I, \"set no bounds to their  cruelty?\"--\"No,\" replied he, \"I expected every moment to feel its  effects; my disguise alone favoured my escape: on the dead bodies of  my countrymen they practised every species of mutilation.\" Here Jean  drew a picture of a nature too horrid to be committed to paper. My  pen could not trace it.----In a word, nothing could exceed the  ferocity of the infuriate populace; and the sacking of the palace of  the Trojan king presents but a faint image of what passed here on the  day which overset the throne of the Bourbons.    According to a calculation, founded as well on the reports of the  police as on the returns of the military corps, it appears that the  number of men killed in the attack of the palace of the _Tuileries_  on the 10th of August 1792, amounted in the whole to very near six  thousand, of whom eight hundred and fifty-two were on the side of the  besieged, and three thousand seven hundred and forty on the side of  the besiegers.    The interior of this palace is not distinguished by any particular  style of architecture, the kings who have resided here having made  such frequent alterations, that the distribution throughout is very  different from that which was at first intended. Here it was that  Catherine de Medicis shut herself up with the Guises, the Gondis, and  Birague, the chancellor, in order to plan the horrible massacre of  that portion of the French nation whose religious tenets trenched on  papal power, and whose spirit of independence alarmed regal jealousy.    Among the series of entertainments, given on the marriage of the king  of Navarre with Marguerite de Valois, was introduced a ballet, in  which the papists, commanded by Charles IX and his brothers, defended  paradise against the huguenots, who, with Navarre at their head, were  all repulsed and driven into hell. Although this pantomime, solely  invented by Catherine, was evidently meant as a prelude to the  dreadful proscription which awaited the protestants, they had no  suspicion of it; and four days after, was consummated the massacre,  where that monster to whom nature had given the form of a woman,  feasted her eyes on the mangled corpses of thousands of bleeding  victims!    No sooner was the Pope informed of the horrors of St. Bartholemew's  day; by the receipt of Admiral de Coligny's head which Catherine  embalmed and sent to him, than he ordered a solemn procession, by way  of returning thanks to heaven for the _happy event_. The account of  this procession so exasperated a gentlemen of Anjou, a protestant of  the name of Bressaut de la Rouvraye, that he swore he would make  eunuchs of all the monks who should fall into his hands; and he  rendered himself famous by keeping his word, and wearing the trophies  of his victory.    The _Louvre_ and the palace of the _Tuileries_ were alternately the  residence of the kings of France, till Lewis XIV built that of  Versailles, after which it was deserted till the minority of Lewis  XV, who, when a little boy, was visited here by Peter the Great, but,  in 1722, the court quitted Paris altogether for Versailles, where it  continued fixed till the 5th of October 1789.    During this long interval, the palace was left under the direction of  a governor, and inhabited only by himself, and persons of various  ranks dependent on the bounty of the crown. When Lewis XVI and his  family were brought hither at that period, the two wings alone were  in proper order; the remainder consisted of spacious apartments  appointed for the king's reception when he came occasionally to  Paris, and ornamented with stately, old-fashioned furniture, which  had not been deranged for years. The first night of their arrival,  they slept in temporary beds, and on the king being solicited the  next day to choose his apartments, he replied: \"Let everyone shift  for himself; for my part, I am very well where I am.\" But this fit of  ill-humor being over, the king and queen visited every part of the  palace, assigning particular rooms to each person of their suite, and  giving directions for sundry repairs and alterations.    Versailles was unfurnished, and the vast quantity of furniture  collected in that palace, during three successive reigns, was  transported to the _Tuileries_ for their majesties' accommodation.  The king chose for himself three rooms on the ground-floor, on the  side of the gallery to the right as you enter the vestibule from the  garden; on the entresol, he established his geographical study; and"]]]
