He was green, and let the boys about here jump him\"--and the rest of his  sentence was confided to his hat, which he had removed to wipe his manly  brow with his red bandanna.    I asked him who was the original proprietor.    \"His name war Fagg.\"    I went to see him. He looked a little older and plainer. He had worked  hard, he said, and was getting on \"so-so.\" I took quite a liking to  him and patronized him to some extent. Whether I did so because I was  beginning to have a distrust for such fellows as Rattler and Mixer is  not necessary for me to state.    You remember how the Coyote Tunnel went in, and how awfully we  shareholders were done! Well, the next thing I heard was that Rattler,  who was one of the heaviest shareholders, was up at Mugginsville keeping  bar for the proprietor of the Mugginsville Hotel, and that old Fagg had  struck it rich, and didn't know what to do with his money. All this was  told me by Mixer, who had been there, settling up matters, and likewise  that Fagg was sweet upon the daughter of the proprietor of the aforesaid  hotel. And so by hearsay and letter I eventually gathered that old  Robins, the hotel man, was trying to get up a match between Nellie  Robins and Fagg. Nellie was a pretty, plump, and foolish little thing,  and would do just as her father wished. I thought it would be a good  thing for Fagg if he should marry and settle down; that as a married man  he might be of some account. So I ran up to Mugginsville one day to look  after things.    It did me an immense deal of good to make Rattler mix my drinks for  me--Rattler! the gay, brilliant, and unconquerable Rattler, who had  tried to snub me two years ago. I talked to him about old Fagg and  Nellie, particularly as I thought the subject was distasteful. He never  liked Fagg, and he was sure, he said, that Nellie didn't. Did Nellie  like anybody else? He turned around to the mirror behind the bar and  brushed up his hair! I understood the conceited wretch. I thought I'd  put Fagg on his guard and get him to hurry up matters. I had a long talk  with him. You could see by the way the poor fellow acted that he was  badly stuck. He sighed, and promised to pluck up courage to hurry  matters to a crisis. Nellie was a good girl, and I think had a sort of  quiet respect for old Fagg's unobtrusiveness. But her fancy was already  taken captive by Rattler's superficial qualities, which were obvious and  pleasing. I don't think Nellie was any worse than you or I. We are more  apt to take acquaintances at their apparent value than their intrinsic  worth. It's less trouble, and, except when we want to trust them, quite  as convenient. The difficulty with women is that their feelings are apt  to get interested sooner than ours, and then, you know, reasoning is out  of the question. This is what old Fagg would have known had he been of  any account. But he wasn't. So much the worse for him.    It was a few months afterward and I was sitting in my office when in  walked old Fagg. I was surprised to see him down, but we talked over the  current topics in that mechanical manner of people who know that they  have something else to say, but are obliged to get at it in that formal  way. After an interval Fagg in his natural manner said:    \"I'm going home!\"    \"Going home?\"    \"Yes--that is, I think I'll take a trip to the Atlantic States. I came  to see you, as you know I have some little property, and I have executed  a power of attorney for you to manage my affairs. I have some papers I'd  like to leave with you. Will you take charge of them?\"    \"Yes,\" I said. \"But what of Nellie?\"    His face fell. He tried to smile, and the combination resulted in one  of the most startling and grotesque effects I ever beheld. At length he  said:    \"I shall not marry Nellie--that is\"--he seemed to apologize internally  for the positive form of expression--\"I think that I had better not.\"    \"David Fagg,\" I said with sudden severity, \"you're of no account!\"    To my astonishment his face brightened. \"Yes,\" said he, \"that's it!--I'm  of no account! But I always knew it. You see I thought Rattler loved  that girl as well as I did, and I knew she liked him better than she did  me, and would be happier I dare say with him. But then I knew that old  Robins would have preferred me to him, as I was better off--and the  girl would do as he said--and, you see, I thought I was kinder in the  way--and so I left. But,\" he continued, as I was about to interrupt him,  \"for fear the old man might object to Rattler, I've lent him enough  to set him up in business for himself in Dogtown. A pushing, active,  brilliant fellow, you know, like Rattler can get along, and will soon be  in his old position again--and you needn't be hard on him, you know, if  he doesn't. Good-by.\"    I was too much disgusted with his treatment of that Rattler to be at all  amiable, but as his business was profitable, I promised to attend to  it, and he left. A few weeks passed. The return steamer arrived, and a  terrible incident occupied the papers for days afterward. People in all  parts of the State conned eagerly the details of an awful shipwreck, and  those who had friends aboard went away by themselves, and read the long  list of the lost under their breath. I read of the gifted, the gallant,  the noble, and loved ones who had perished, and among them I think I was  the first to read the name of David Fagg. For the \"man of no account\"  had \"gone home!\"          MLISS      CHAPTER I    Just where the Sierra Nevada begins to subside in gentler undulations,  and the rivers grow less rapid and yellow, on the side of a great red  mountain, stands \"Smith's Pocket.\" Seen from the red road at sunset,  in the red light and the red dust, its white houses look like the  outcroppings of quartz on the mountainside. The red stage topped  with red-shirted passengers is lost to view half a dozen times in the  tortuous descent, turning up unexpectedly in out-of-the-way places, and  vanishing altogether within a hundred yards of the town. It is probably  owing to this sudden twist in the road that the advent of a stranger  at Smith's Pocket is usually attended with a peculiar circumstance.  Dismounting from the vehicle at the stage office, the too-confident  traveler is apt to walk straight out of town under the impression that  it lies in quite another direction. It is related that one of the tunnel  men, two miles from town, met one of these self-reliant passengers  with a carpetbag, umbrella, Harper's Magazine, and other evidences of  \"Civilization and Refinement,\" plodding along over the road he had just  ridden, vainly endeavoring to find the settlement of Smith's Pocket.    An observant traveler might have found some compensation for his  disappointment in the weird aspect of that vicinity. There were huge  fissures on the hillside, and displacements of the red soil, resembling  more the chaos of some primary elemental upheaval than the work of  man; while halfway down, a long flume straddled its narrow body and  disproportionate legs over the chasm, like an enormous fossil of some  forgotten antediluvian. At every step smaller ditches crossed the road,  hiding in their sallow depths unlovely streams that crept away to a  clandestine union with the great yellow torrent below, and here and  there were the ruins of some cabin with the chimney alone left intact  and the hearthstone open to the skies.    The settlement of Smith's Pocket owed its origin to the finding of a  \"pocket\" on its site by a veritable Smith. Five thousand dollars were  taken out of it in one half-hour by Smith. Three thousand dollars were  expended by Smith and others in erecting a flume and in tunneling. And  then Smith's Pocket was found to be only a pocket, and subject like  other pockets to depletion. Although Smith pierced the bowels of the  great red mountain, that five thousand dollars was the first and last  return of his labor. The mountain grew reticent of its golden secrets,  and the flume steadily ebbed away the remainder of Smith's fortune.  Then Smith went into quartz-mining; then into quartz-milling; then into  hydraulics and ditching, and then by easy degrees into saloonkeeping.  Presently it was whispered that Smith was drinking a great deal; then it  was known that Smith was a habitual drunkard, and then people began to  think, as they are apt to, that he had never been anything else. But the  settlement of Smith's Pocket, like that of most discoveries, was happily  not dependent on the fortune of its pioneer, and other parties projected  tunnels and found pockets. So Smith's Pocket became a settlement, with  its two fancy stores, its two hotels, its one express office, and its  two first families. Occasionally its one long straggling street was  overawed by the assumption of the latest San Francisco fashions,  imported per express, exclusively to the first families; making outraged  Nature, in the ragged outline of her furrowed surface, look still more  homely, and putting personal insult on that greater portion of the  population to whom the Sabbath, with a change of linen, brought merely  the necessity of cleanliness without the luxury of adornment. Then there  was a Methodist Church, and hard by a Monte Bank, and a little beyond,  on the mountainside, a graveyard; and then a little schoolhouse.    \"The Master,\" as he was known to his little flock, sat alone one night  in the schoolhouse, with some open copybooks before him, carefully  making those bold and full characters which are supposed to combine the  extremes of chirographical and moral excellence, and had got as far as  \"Riches are deceitful,\" and was elaborating"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"fathoms, sandy  ground, two or three miles from some rocky islets which lie off the west  side of No. 2. The flood tide at this anchorage came from the north-east,  one mile per hour.    We got under way again in the morning [WEDNESDAY 29 SEPTEMBER 1802]; but  the wind being light and unfavourable, and the tide adverse, I went off  in the whale boat, accompanied by Messrs. Brown and Westall, to examine  the passage between the rocky islets and No. 2, directing lieutenant  Fowler to follow with the ship when the signal should be made. We first  landed at the islets, where the same kind of pine as seen at Port Bowen  and other places, was abundant; and leaving the two gentlemen there, I  sounded the passage, which was a mile and a half wide, with a sandy  bottom of 8 to 13 fathoms deep, and sheltered from all eastern winds. The  signal was then made to the ship; and so soon as she was brought to  anchor, I went to examine a little cove, or basin, into which the height  of the surrounding hills gave expectation of finding a run of fresh  water. The entrance is little more than wide enough for the oars of a  rowing boat, the basin, within side, is mostly dry at low water, and the  borders are over-run with the tiresome mangrove; but when the tide is in,  it is one of the prettiest little places imaginable. In searching round  the skirts, between the mangroves and feet of the hills, a torrent-worn  gully was found with several holes of water; and one in particular, near  the edge of the mangroves, where, by cutting a rolling way for the casks,  the holds of the two vessels might be filled; and at a beach without side  of the entrance to the basin, several hauls of the seine were made with  good success.    THURSDAY 30 SEPTEMBER 1802    Early next morning, lieutenant Fowler landed with a party of men prepared  to cut through the mangroves; but fresh water was discovered to ooze out  from amongst them, much below high-water mark; and by digging in the sand  at half ebb, our casks might be filled more easily, and with better water  than in the gully. Whilst this duty was going on, the carpenters were  sent to cut fire wood and pine logs upon the rocky islets, the botanical  gentlemen followed their pursuits where it best pleased them, and my time  was occupied in surveying. From a hill near the head of the basin, I took  bearings of all the objects to the south and westward; amongst which, the  five following were the most important to the connexion of the survey.      Mount Westall on the main (not distinct),               S. 23 deg. 5' E.  Northumberland Islands, the 4th, a peak,                S. 18 20  E.  Northumberland Islands, the 7th, station on the hill,   S. 19 30  W.  Northumberland Islands, a peaked I. marked 'h', S. 89 deg. 55' to N. 87 35 W.  Northumberland Islands, high northmost, marked 'i',     N. 57  0  W.      The circle was completed in the afternoon, from a higher part of the  island near the north point; and the weather being tolerably clear,  nearly the whole of the Northumberland Islands were comprehended in the  bearings from one or the other station. Two distant pieces of land in the  N. W. by N., marked _k_ and _k1_, situate near the eastern Cumberland  Islands of captain Cook, were also distinguished; but to the north-east,  where I expected to see a continuation of the reefs discovered by captain  Campbell of the brig Deptford, in 1797, neither reef nor island was  visible.    SATURDAY 2 OCTOBER 1802    On the 2nd of October, Mr. Brown accompanied me to No. 1, the  southernmost of the Percy Isles, which is near five miles long, and the  second of the group in magnitude. Fresh water was found in ponds near the  shore, and there were clusters of pine trees; but in general, this island  is inferior to No. 2, both in soil and productions. Of the two peaked  hills upon it, the south-easternmost is highest; but being craggy and  difficult to be ascended, my bearings were taken from the western hill.  In returning to the ship in the evening, we passed between No. 6 and the  east side of No. 2, and round the north end of the latter island, in  order to see the form of its coasts: the water was deep, and there  appeared to be no hidden dangers.    SUNDAY 3 OCTOBER 1802    On the 3rd, Mr. Bauer, the natural-history painter, went with me to the  northern Percy Isles, upon each of which is a hill somewhat peaked; but  that on No. 3 is much the most so, and the highest; and being thickly  covered with pine trees, is called _Pine Peak_: it lies in 21 deg. 311/2' south  and 150 deg. 141/2' east. My principal object was to take angles for the  survey; and not being able to ascend Pine Peak, from its great acclivity,  we went onward to the two smaller islands No. 4; and from the top of the  easternmost, a third Cumberland Island, marked _k2_, was distinguished,  and the following amongst many other bearings, were taken.      Percy Isle No. 3, Pine Peak, distant 21/2 miles,      S   2 deg.  5' W.  The ship, at anchor under No. 2,                    S. 10  48  W.  Northumberland I., the 7th, station,                S. 14   0  W.  Northumberland I., the peak marked 'h',             S. 67  35  W.  Northumberland I., the high, northmost, marked 'i', N. 73  10  W.  Cumberland I., marked 'k', centre,                  N. 36   0  W.  Cumberland I., marked 'k2', centre,                 N. 42  50  W.      There is no shelter amongst the northern Percy Isles against east winds;  but ships may pass between them, taking care to avoid a rock which lies  one mile northward from the Pine Peak, and is dry at low water. Nothing  was seen on these islands to merit more particular notice; and their  forms and situations will be best learned from the chart.    On returning to the ship at nine in the evening, I found lieutenant  Fowler had quitted the shore with his tents and people, the holds were  completed with water, and both vessels ready for sea.    No. 2, the largest of the Percy Isles, is about thirteen miles in  circumference; and in its greatest elevation perhaps a thousand feet. The  stone is mostly of two kinds. A concreted mass of different substances,  held together by a hard, dark-coloured cement, was the most abundant; I  did not see either coral or pumice-stone in the composition, but it  otherwise much resembled that of Aken's Island in Shoal-water Bay, and  still more a stratum seen at the north-west part of Long Island: it was  found at the tops of the highest hills, as well as in the lower parts.  The second kind of stone is light, close-grained, and easily splits, but  not in layers; it is of a yellowish colour, and probably argillaceous.    The surface of the island is either sandy or stony, or both, with a small  proportion of vegetable soil intermixed. It is generally covered with  grass and wood; and some of the vallies round the basin might be made to  produce vegetables, especially one in which there was a small run, and  several holes of fresh water. The principal wood is the _eucalyptus_, or  gum tree, but it is not large; small cabbage palms grow in the gullies,  and also a species of fig tree, which bears its fruit on the stem,  instead of the ends of the branches; and pines are scattered in the most  rocky places.    No inhabitants were seen upon any of the islands, but there were deserted  fire places upon all. The Indians probably come over from the main land  at certain times, to take turtle, in which they must be much more  dexterous than we were; for although many turtle were seen in the water,  and we watched the beaches at night, not one was caught. There are no  kangaroos upon the Percy Isles; nor did we see any useful birds. The  large bats or vampyres, common to this country, and called flying-foxes  at Port Jackson, were often found hanging by the claws, with their heads  downward, under the shady tops of the palm trees; and one solitary eel of  a good size, was caught on clearing out the hole where our water casks  had been first intended to be filled.    Pines, fresh water, and fish will be some inducement to visit the Percy  Isles; as perhaps may be the hump-backed whales, of which a considerable  number was seen in the vicinity. The best and most convenient anchorage,  and indeed the only one to be recommended, is that where the Investigator  lay, directly off the basin; in mid-channel between No. 2 and the western  pine islets. It is sheltered at fourteen points to the eastward, and  three towards the west; and there being a clear passage out, both to the  north and south, no danger is to be apprehended: the bottom, however,  does not hold very well.    A wet dock might be made of the basin without other trouble or expense  than a little deepening of the narrow entrance, and throwing a pair of  gates across; and were the mud to be cleared out, the basin would contain  fifteen or twenty sail of merchant ships with great ease.    The flood _tide_ came from the north and the ebb from the south, past the  anchorage; but on the outside, they run south-west and north-east. It is  not extraordinary that the rise and fall by the shore did not exactly  coincide with the swinging of the ship; but that the time of high water  should differ three hours, and the rise twenty feet from Broad Sound, is  remarkable. According to Mr. Fowler's observations in the basin, it was  high water there _eight hours after_ the moon's passage; and the rise at  the neaps and springs appeared to be from eight to twelve feet.    Three meridian observations to the north, taken by lieutenant Flinders,  gave the _latitude_ of our anchorage,  21 deg. 39' 31\" S.    _Longitude_, according to the position of Upper Head and the survey from  thence, 150 deg. 12' E.    _Variation_ of the needle, observed on the low south-west point of No. 2,  8 deg. 28' E.    Three compasses on board the ship at anchor, gave 5 deg. 34' when the head  was east, or corrected to the meridian, 8 deg. 4' E.    Upon the different elevated"]]]
