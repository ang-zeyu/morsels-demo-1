Near the western  end of Lake Ontario the two Sulpician missionaries met another  Frenchman, Jolliet, who had come down to Lake Superior by way of the  Detroit passage, which is really the portion of the St. Lawrence  connecting Lake Huron with Lake Erie. Jolliet told the missionary de  Casson of a great tribe in the far west, the Pottawatomies, who had  asked for missionaries, and who were of Algonkin stock. La Salle, on  the other hand, was determined to make for the rumoured Ohio River,  which lay somewhere to the south-west of Lake Erie.    The two Sulpicians wintered in \"the earthly paradise\" to the north of  Lake Erie, passing a delightful six months there in the amazing  abundance of game and fish. They then met with various disasters to  their canoes, and consequently gave up their western journey, passing  northwards through Detroit and Lake St. Clair into Lake Huron, and  thence to the Jesuit mission station of the Sault Ste. Marie. Here  they were received rather coldly, as being rivals in the mission field  and in exploration. They in their turn accused the Jesuits of thinking  mainly, if not entirely, of the foundation of French colonies, and  very little of evangelizing the natives.    JOLLIET, a Canadian by birth,[8] was dispatched by the Viceroy of  Canada in 1672 to explore the far west. Two years--1670--previously  the French Government had for the first time adopted a really definite  policy about Canada, and had taken formal possession of the Lake  region and of all the territories lying between the lakes and the  Mississippi. A great assembly of Indians was held at Sault Ste. Marie,  near the east end of Lake Superior; and here a representative of the  French Government, accompanied by numerous missionaries and by  Jolliet, read a proclamation of the sovereignty of King Louis XIV of  France and Navarre. Below a tall cross was erected a great shield  bearing the arms of France. Father Allouez addressed the Indians in  the Algonkin language, and told them of the all-powerful Louis XIV,  who \"had ten thousand commanders and captains, each as great as the  Governor of Quebec\". He reminded them how the troops of this king had  beaten the unconquerable Iroquois, of how he possessed innumerable  soldiers and uncountable ships; that at times the ground of France  shook with the discharge of cannon, while the blaze of musketry was  like the lightning. He pictured the king covered with the blood of his  enemies and riding in the middle of his cavalry, and ordering so many  of his enemies to be slain that no account could be kept of the number  of their scalps, whilst their blood flowed in rivers. The Amerindians  being what they were, addicted to warfare, and only recognizing the  right of the strongest, it may be that this gospel of force was not  quite so shocking and unchristian as it reads to us nearly 250 years  afterwards, though it jars very much as coming from the lips of a  missionary of Christianity. However, it must be remembered that but  for the valour of the French soldiers in the awful period between 1648  and 1666 (when the Mohawks received a thorough and well-deserved  thrashing) many of the tribes addressed on this occasion by the Jesuit  missionaries would have been completely exterminated; the Iroquois  would have depopulated much of north-eastern America. It is obvious,  indeed, from our study of the conditions of life amongst the  Amerindians, that one reason why the New World was so poorly populated  at the time of its discovery by Europeans was the wars of  extermination between tribe and tribe; for America between the Arctic  regions and Tierra del Fuego is marvellously well supplied with  natural food products--game, fish, fruits, nuts, roots, and  grain--much more so than any area of similar extent in the Old World.    [Footnote 8: Born at Quebec in 1645.]    Jolliet was to be accompanied on his westward expedition by Father  JACQUES MARQUETTE,[9] a Jesuit missionary who had become well  acquainted with the tribes visiting Lake Superior, and had learnt the  Siou dialect of the Illinois people. On May 17, 1673, Jolliet and  Marquette started from the Straits of Michili-Makinak with only two  bark canoes and five Amerindians. They coasted along the north coast  of Lake Michigan, passed into Green Bay, and thence up the River Fox.  They were assisted by the Maskutins, or Fire Indians, and were given  Miami guides. Thence the natives assisted them to transport their  canoes and baggage over the very short distance that separates the  upper waters of the Fox River from the Wisconsin River, and down the  Wisconsin they glided till they reached the great Mississippi. The  Governor of Quebec, who had sent Jolliet on this mission, believed  that the Great River of the west would lead them to the Gulf of  California, which was then called the Vermilion Sea by the Spaniards,  because it resembled in shape and colour the Red Sea.    [Footnote 9: Father Jacques Marquette was born in the province of  Champagne, eastern France. He came to Canada when he was twenty-nine  years old, having already been prepared by the Jesuits for priesthood  and missionary work since his seventeenth year. He spent nine years in  Canada, and died at the age of thirty-eight. He has left an enduring  memory for goodness, courage, and purity of life.]    \"On the 17th of June (1673)\", writes Father Marquette, \"we safely  entered the Mississippi with a joy that I cannot express. Its current  is slow and gentle, the width very unequal. On its banks there are  hardly any woods or mountains. The islands are most beautiful, and  they are covered with fine trees. We saw deer and cattle (bison),  geese, and swans. From time to time we came upon monstrous fish, one  of which struck our canoe with such violence that I thought it was a  great tree. On another occasion we saw on the water a monster with the  head of a tiger, a sharp nose like that of a wild cat, with whiskers  and straight erect ears. The head was grey, and the neck quite black  (possibly a lynx).... We found that turkeys had taken the place of  game, and the _pisikiou_, or wild cattle, that of the other animals.\"    Father Marquette, of course, by his wild cattle means the bison, of  which he proceeds to give an excellent description. He adds: \"They are  very fierce, and not a year passes without their killing some savages.  When attacked, they catch a man on their horns if they can, toss him  in the air, throw him on the ground, then trample him under foot and  kill him. If a person fires at them from a distance with either a bow  or a gun, he must immediately after the shot throw himself down and  hide in the grass, for if they perceive him who has fired they run at  him and attack him.\"    Soon after entering the Mississippi, Marquette noticed some rocks  which by their height and length inspired awe. \"We saw upon one of  them two painted monsters which at first made us afraid, and upon  which the boldest savages dare not long rest their eyes. They are as  large as a calf; they have horns on their heads like those of deer, a  horrible look, red eyes, a beard like a tiger's, a face somewhat like  a man's, a body covered with scales, and so long a tail that it winds  all round the body and ends like that of a fish. Green, red, and black  are the three colours composing the picture. Moreover, these two  monsters are so well painted that we cannot believe that any savage is  their author, for good painters in France would find it difficult to  paint so well, and, besides, they are so high up on the rock that it  is difficult to reach that place conveniently to paint them.\"[10]    [Footnote 10: These remarkable rock pictures were situated immediately  above the present city of Alton, Illinois. In 1812 they still remained  in a good state of preservation, but the thoughtless Americans had  gradually destroyed them by 1867 in quarrying the rock for building  stone.]    As the Jolliet expedition paddled down the Mississippi--ever so easily  and swiftly--a marvellous panorama unfolded itself before the  Frenchmen's fascinated gaze. Immense herds of bison occasionally  appeared on the river banks, flocks of turkeys flew up from the glades  and roosted in the trees and on the river bank. Everywhere the natives  seemed friendly, and Father Marquette was usually able to communicate  with them through his knowledge of the Illinois Algonkin dialect,  which the Siou understood.    [Illustration: INDIANS HUNTING BISON]    On their first meeting with the Mississippi Indians, the French  explorers were not only offered the natives' pipes to smoke in token  of peace, but an old man amongst the latter uttered these words to  Jolliet: \"How beautiful the sun is, O Frenchman, when thou comest to  visit us. Our village awaits thee, and thou shalt enter all our cabins  in peace.\"... \"There was a crowd of people,\" writes Marquette; \"they  devoured us with their eyes, but nevertheless preserved profound  silence. We could, however, hear these words addressed to us from time  to time in a low voice: 'How good it is, my brothers, that you should  visit us'.    \"... The council was followed by a great feast, consisting of four  dishes, which had to be partaken of in accordance with all their  fashions. The first course was a great wooden platter full of  sagamite, that is to say, meal of Indian corn boiled in water, and  seasoned with fat. The Master of the Ceremonies filled a spoon with  sagamite three or four times, and put it to my mouth as if I were a  little child. He did the same to Monsieur Jollyet. As a second course  he caused a second platter to be brought, on which were three fish. He  took some pieces of them, removed the bones therefrom, and, after  blowing upon them to cool them, he put them in our mouths as one would  give food to a bird. For the third course, they brought a large dog  that had just been killed, but, when they learned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#19)"],[1,"truth; but, as  a pledge that I will fulfil my promise, I will give to you, as  hostages, my wife and boy. Stay your avenging hand, I pray you, until  my desire shall have been attained.\"    Umanosuke, who was a brave and honest youth, as famous in the clan for  the goodness of his heart as for his skill in the use of arms, when he  heard Sanza's humble petition, relented, and said--    \"I agree to wait, and will take your wife and boy as hostages for your  return.\"    \"I humbly thank you,\" said Sanza. \"When I shall have chastised  Banzayemon, I will return, and you shall claim your revenge.\"    So Sanza went his way to Yedo to seek for Banzayemon, and Umanosuke  mourned over his father's grave.    Now Banzayemon, when he arrived in Yedo, found himself friendless and  without the means of earning his living, when by accident he heard of  the fame of Chobei of Bandzuin, the chief of the Otokodate, to whom he  applied for assistance; and having entered the fraternity, supported  himself by giving fencing-lessons. He had been plying his trade for  some time, and had earned some little reputation, when Sanza reached  the city and began his search for him. But the days and months passed  away, and, after a year's fruitless seeking, Sanza, who had spent all  his money without obtaining a clue to the whereabouts of his enemy,  was sorely perplexed, and was driven to live by his wits as a  fortune-teller. Work as he would, it was a hard matter for him to gain  the price of his daily food, and, in spite of all his pains, his  revenge seemed as far off as ever, when he bethought him that the  Yoshiwara was one of the most bustling places in the city, and that if  he kept watch there, sooner or later he would be sure to fall in with  Banzayemon. So be bought a hat of plaited bamboo, that completely  covered his face, and lay in wait at the Yoshiwara.    One day Banzayemon and two of Chobei's apprentices Token Gombei and  Shirobei, who, from his wild and indocile nature, was surnamed \"the  Colt,\" were amusing themselves and drinking in an upper storey of a  tea-house in the Yoshiwara, when Token Gombei, happening to look down  upon the street below, saw a Samurai pass by, poorly clad in worn-out  old clothes, but whose poverty-stricken appearance contrasted with  his proud and haughty bearing.    \"Look there!\" said Gombei, calling the attention of the others; \"look  at that Samurai. Dirty and ragged as his coat is, how easy it is to  see that he is of noble birth! Let us wardsmen dress ourselves up in  never so fine clothes, we could not look as he does.\"    \"Ay,\" said Shirobei, \"I wish we could make friends with him, and ask  him up here to drink a cup of wine with us. However, it would not be  seemly for us wardsmen to go and invite a person of his condition.\"    \"We can easily get over that difficulty,\" said Banzayemon. \"As I am a  Samurai myself, there will be no impropriety in my going and saying a  few civil words to him, and bringing him in.\"    The other two having joyfully accepted the offer, Banzayemon ran  downstairs, and went up to the strange Samurai and saluted him,  saying--    \"I pray you to wait a moment, Sir Samurai. My name is Fuwa Banzayemon  at your service. I am a Ronin, as I judge from your appearance that  you are yourself. I hope you will not think me rude if I venture to  ask you to honour me with your friendship, and to come into this  tea-house to drink a cup of wine with me and two of my friends.\"    The strange Samurai, who was no other than Sanza, looking at the  speaker through the interstices of his deep bamboo hat, and  recognizing his enemy Banzayemon, gave a start of surprise, and,  uncovering his head, said sternly--    \"Have you forgotten my face, Banzayemon?\"    For a moment Banzayemon was taken aback, but quickly recovering  himself, he replied, \"Ah! Sir Sanza, you may well be angry with me;  but since I stole the Muramasa sword and fled to Yedo I have known no  peace: I have been haunted by remorse for my crime. I shall not resist  your vengeance: do with me as it shall seem best to you; or rather  take my life, and let there be an end of this quarrel.\"    \"Nay,\" answered Sanza, \"to kill a man who repents him of his sins is a  base and ignoble action. When you stole from me the Muramasa blade  which had been confided to my care by my lord, I became a disgraced  and ruined man. Give me back that sword, that I may lay it before my  lord, and I will spare your life. I seek to slay no man needlessly.\"    \"Sir Sanza, I thank you for your mercy. At this moment I have not the  sword by me, but if you will go into yonder tea-house and wait awhile,  I will fetch it and deliver it into your hands.\"    Sanza having consented to this, the two men entered the tea-house,  where Banzayemon's two companions were waiting for them. But  Banzayemon, ashamed of his own evil deed, still pretended that Sanza  was a stranger, and introduced him as such, saying--    \"Come Sir Samurai, since we have the honour of your company, let me  offer you a wine-cup.\"    Banzayemon and the two men pressed the wine-cup upon Sanza so often  that the fumes gradually got into his head and he fell asleep; the two  wardsmen, seeing this, went out for a walk, and Banzayemon, left alone  with the sleeping man, began to revolve fresh plots against him in his  mind. On a sudden, a thought struck him. Noiselessly seizing Sanza's  sword, which he had laid aside on entering the room, he stole softly  downstairs with it, and, carrying it into the back yard, pounded and  blunted its edge with a stone, and having made it useless as a weapon,  he replaced it in its scabbard, and running upstairs again laid it in  its place without disturbing Sanza, who, little suspecting treachery,  lay sleeping off the effects of the wine. At last, however, he awoke,  and, ashamed at having been overcome by drink, he said to Banzayemon--    \"Come, Banzayemon, we have dallied too long; give me the Muramasa  sword, and let me go.\"    \"Of course,\" replied the other, sneeringly, \"I am longing to give it  back to you; but unfortunately, in my poverty, I have been obliged to  pawn it for fifty ounces of silver. If you have so much money about  you, give it to me and I will return the sword to you.\"    \"Wretch!\" cried Sanza, seeing that Banzayemon was trying to fool him,  \"have I not had enough of your vile tricks? At any rate, if I cannot  get back the sword, your head shall be laid before my lord in its  place. Come,\" added he, stamping his foot impatiently, \"defend  yourself.\"    \"With all my heart. But not here in this tea-house. Let us go to the  Mound, and fight it out.\"    \"Agreed! There is no need for us to bring trouble on the landlord.  Come to the Mound of the Yoshiwara.\"    So they went to the Mound, and drawing their swords, began to fight  furiously. As the news soon spread abroad through the Yoshiwara that a  duel was being fought upon the Mound, the people flocked out to see  the sight; and among them came Token Gombei and Shirobei, Banzayemon's  companions, who, when they saw that the combatants were their own  friend and the strange Samurai, tried to interfere and stop the fight,  but, being hindered by the thickness of the crowd, remained as  spectators. The two men fought desperately, each driven by fierce rage  against the other; but Sanza, who was by far the better fencer of the  two, once, twice, and again dealt blows which should have cut  Banzayemon down, and yet no blood came forth. Sanza, astonished at  this, put forth all his strength, and fought so skilfully, that all  the bystanders applauded him, and Banzayemon, though he knew his  adversary's sword to be blunted, was so terrified that he stumbled and  fell. Sanza, brave soldier that he was, scorned to strike a fallen  foe, and bade him rise and fight again. So they engaged again, and  Sanza, who from the beginning had had the advantage, slipped and fell  in his turn; Banzayemon, forgetting the mercy which had been shown to  him, rushed up, with bloodthirsty joy glaring in his eyes, and stabbed  Sanza in the side as he lay on the ground. Faint as he was, he could  not lift his hand to save himself; and his craven foe was about to  strike him again, when the bystanders all cried shame upon his  baseness. Then Gombei and Shirobei lifted up their voices and said--    \"Hold, coward! Have you forgotten how your own life was spared but a  moment since? Beast of a Samurai, we have been your friends hitherto,  but now behold in us the avengers of this brave man.\"    With these words the two men drew their dirks, and the spectators fell  back as they rushed in upon Banzayemon, who, terror-stricken by their  fierce looks and words, fled without having dealt the death-blow to  Sanza. They tried to pursue him, but he made good his escape, so the  two men returned to help the wounded man. When he came to himself by  dint of their kind treatment, they spoke to him and comforted him, and  asked him what province he came from, that they might write to his  friends and tell them what had befallen him. Sanza, in a voice faint  from pain and loss of blood, told them his name and the story of the  stolen sword, and of his enmity against Banzayemon. \"But,\" said he,  \"just now, when I was fighting, I struck Banzayemon more than once,  and without effect. How could that have been?\" Then they looked at his  sword, which had fallen by his side, and saw that the edge was all  broken away. More than ever they felt indignant at the baseness of  Banzayemon's heart, and redoubled their kindness to Sanza; but, in.  spite of all their efforts, he grew weaker and weaker, until at last  his breathing ceased altogether. So they buried the corpse honourably  in an adjoining temple, and wrote to Sanza's wife and son, describing  to them the manner of his death.    Now when Sanza's wife, who had long been anxiously expecting her  husband's return, opened the letter and learned the cruel  circumstances of his "]]]
