The point off which this occurred  was named Cape Kidnapper. As there was no appearance of a harbour, Cook  altered his course to the north at Cape Turnagain, 40 degrees 34 minutes  South, to see if he could not do better in the other direction.    All the canoes seen along this coast were well made, far in advance of  anything they had seen before, and the grotesque carving and ornamental  work was admirably executed. The dresses warn were usually two  cloak-shaped garments, one warn round the shoulders, the other round the  loins, and were made of a substance like hemp, some being very fine.  Banks had purchased something like them at Rio de Janeiro, for which he  gave thirty-six shillings, thinking it cheap, but these were as fine, if  not finer, in texture. Dogs, which were used as food, and rats were the  only quadrupeds seen. Whilst Banks and Solander were collecting, they  discovered a large natural arch, which the former describes as the most  magnificent surprise he had ever met with. It was sketched by Parkinson,  and is engraved in the History. Cook also made a pen-and-ink sketch of  it, which is in the British Museum.    COOK'S WASHING STOLEN.    On 31st October they rounded East Cape, and following the coast, which  trended more to the west, they saw a great number of villages and patches  of cultivation, some of the last looking as if freshly ploughed. The  whole aspect of the country was changing for the better, but the  inhabitants did not seem more peaceably inclined. Five canoes came out to  the ship fully armed, and apparently bent on mischief. Cook was very  busy, and did not want them on board, so to keep them off ordered a  musket to be fired over them; but as it only caused them to stop for a  moment, a round shot was sent over them, and they hurriedly turned tail.  The place was given the name Cape Runaway. White Island was named, but it  must have been quiescent as there is no note of its being a volcano. As  they sailed along the coast they met with canoes from which fish,  lobsters, and mussels were purchased, and trading seemed well  established, when one gentleman took a fancy to Cook's sheets, which were  trailing overboard (they were in the wash), and refused to give them up.  Muskets were fired over them and they fled, and Cook lost his sheets.  From near White Island, Mount Edgecombe was seen, named after the  sergeant of marines. It is a high round mountain, and forms a conspicuous  landmark on both sides of the North Island. During this day they had  noticed several small villages perched on difficult eminences and  surrounded by palisades, which Tupia declared were \"Mories or places of  worship,\" but, says Cook:    \"I rather think they are places of retreat or strongholds, where they  defend themselves against the attack of an enemy, as some of them seem'd  not ill design'd for that purpose.\"    British soldiers have since discovered that a Maori Pah is \"not ill  designed for that purpose.\" Cook most unfortunately missed the Harbour of  Tauranga, the only safe port on the east coast between Auckland and  Wellington for ships of any size.    NATIVE ACCOUNT.    In what is now known as Cook's Bay, they managed to induce the natives to  trade, and purchased crayfish, over which Parkinson waxes enthusiastic,  and \"Mackerell as good as ever was eat,\" the latter in such large  quantities that they were able to salt a considerable number, thus saving  their sea stores. After an observation of a transit of Mercury, in which  they were not very successful (Wharton thinks they were taken by  surprise, the transit occurring somewhat earlier than expected; Green  says: \"Unfortunately for the seamen, their look-out was on the wrong side  of the sun. The end was likewise as grossly mistaken\"), they returned to  the ship and found that there had been a difficulty with the natives, who  had assumed a very threatening manner, and one attempted to run off with  a piece of calico which was at that time a subject of barter. Mr. Gore  seized a musket and fired, killing his man. Colonel Mundy, in Our  Antipodes, says he saw a man named Taniwha, in 1848, who remembered  Cook's visit, and imitated his walk, with the peculiar manner he had of  waving his right hand, and also told of the kindly way Cook had with the  children. Taniwha told Mundy that after the man was shot, the Maoris  landed, consulted over the body, and decided that as the corpse  \"commenced the quarrel by the theft of the calico, his death should not  be revenged, but that he should be buried in the cloth which he had paid  for with his life.\" Colonel Wynyard took down the same story from  Taniwha's lips in 1852, when he was supposed to be about ninety-three,  and says: \"His faculties were little impaired, and his great age  perceptible more from a stoop and grey hairs than any other infirmity.\"  Cook expressed very strong disapproval of Mr. Gore's conduct.    Next day Cook and Banks explored a river that entered near where they  were anchored, the east side of which was very barren, but the west was  much better, no signs of cultivation showing on either. Wild fowl were  plentiful, and oysters, \"as good as ever came from Colchester,\" and of  about the same size, says Banks, were taken on board in large quantities:    \"laid down under the booms, and employed the ship's company very well,  who, I sincerely believe, did nothing but eat them from the time they  came on board till night, by which time a large part were expended. But  this gave us no kind of uneasiness, since we well knew that not the boat  only, but the ship might be loaded in one tide almost, as they are dry at  half ebb.\"    Cook thinks the inhabitants lived on fish, and shell-fish, with fern  roots for bread, for very large heaps of shells were found, but no signs  of cultivation.    A fortified village was visited, the inhabitants good-naturedly  conducting them all over, and showing whatever they expressed a wish to  see. It was built on a high promontory, whose sides were in some places  quite inaccessible, in others very difficult, except where it faced the  narrow edge of the hill. Here it was defended by a double ditch and bank,  with two rows of pickets, the inner row being on the bank, leaving  standing-room for the defenders. The inner ditch was 24 feet from bottom  to top of the bank. A stage about 30 feet high, 40 feet long, and 6 feet  wide, was erected inside the fence, with a second, a few paces from it,  placed at right angles; from these the garrison were able to throw their  spears and stones on to the heads of their enemies. The whole village was  surrounded by a strong picket fence, running close to the edge of the  hill. The entire surface of the top of the hill was cut up into small  squares, each surrounded by its own fence, and communicating by narrow  lanes, with little gateways, so that if the outer defences were forced  each square could be defended in turn. Cook says:    \"I look upon it to be a very strong and well choose Post, and where a  small number of resolute men might defend themselves a long time against  a vast superior force, armed in the manner as these people are.\"    He noticed, with quick eye, the great failing in these native fortresses,  that is, the want of storage for water. In these Maori villages it was  remarked that sanitary arrangements were provided, such as, says Beckmann  in his History of Inventions, did not exist in the palace of the King of  Spain at that time.    Large quantities of iron sand were noted here, but the use was quite  unknown to the natives, who were indifferent to the iron tools or spikes  which had hitherto been such a valuable medium of exchange elsewhere. A  large supply of wild celery and a fresh boat-load of oysters were put on  board; a tree was marked with the name of the ship, the date, and one or  two other particulars, the flag was hoisted, saluted, and possession  taken of the country, and the ship sailed again on her journey.    AT THE THAMES.    Running closely along the coast, they hauled round Cape Colville into  \"the Entrance of a Straight, Bay or River,\" and anchored for the night,  and in the morning they stood on along the east side. Canoes came off,  and from the behaviour of the occupants, some of whom came on board at  the first invitation, it was judged that favourable accounts had been  heard of the ship. After running about 5 leagues the water shoaled to  about 6 fathoms, and the ship anchored, and boats were sent out to sound.  No great increase of depth being found, the pinnace and long-boat went up  a river about 9 miles away, and on account of a fancied resemblance named  it the Thames. They landed at a village near the mouth, being well  received, but desiring to take advantage of the flood-tide which ran \"as  strong as it does in the River Thames below bridge,\" they made no stay;  they went up about 14 miles, and then, finding little alteration in the  appearance of the country, landed to inspect some large trees of a kind  they had previously noticed. One was carefully measured, and was found to  be 19 feet 6 inches girth at 6 feet from the ground, and, by means of  Cook's quadrant, 89 feet to the lowest branch. It was perfectly straight,  and tapered very slightly, and some were seen that were even larger. This  was the Black Pine; to the Maoris, Matoi, and to the naturalist,  Podocarpus.    On the way down the river their friends of the morning came out and  \"traffick'd with us in the most friendly manner imaginable, until they  had disposed of the few trifles they had.\" When the boats got outside  they had to anchor, as a strong tide and breeze were against them, and  they did not reach the ship till next morning, when the breeze

[Footnote *: Aided by experimenter.]        The data of table 6 indicate for this problem only three pronounced  reactive tendencies: (a) As the initial tendency, the choice of the  second box from the right end. This proved surprisingly weak, in view of  the animal's long training on problem 2, and it disappeared quickly. (b)  Choice of the end boxes, and (c) direct choice of the right box.    For this, as for the other problems, extreme differences in method and  in time and degree of success appear for the different settings. Thus,  while settings 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10 proved to be easy, settings 4, 5,  8, and 9 were evidently more difficult.    [Illustration: FIGURE 20.--Error curve of learning for the solution of  problem 3 (alternately the first box at the left end and the first at  the right end) by Sobke.]    From the first this problem promised to be much easier for Sobke than  problem 2, and although the actual number of trials necessary for the  solution is greater by sixty for problem 3 than for problem 2,  comparison of the data of the tables justifies the statement that the  third problem was both easier and more nearly adequately solved than the  second. This is not surprising when the nature of the two problems is  considered, for whereas problem 2 requires choice by perception of the  relationship of secondness from the right end of the group, problem 3  requires, instead, the choice of the end member of the group each time,  with the additional variation of alternation of ends. Now as it happens,  the end member is easily selected by the monkey, and it appears further  that alternation was relatively easy for Sobke to acquire. Consequently,  the combination of end and alternation proved easier than the choice of  the second from the right end of the group.    The above statements are supported by comparison of the curves of  learning. The curve for problem 2, figure 19, is extremely irregular;  that for problem 3, figure 20, much more regular. Similarly, the daily  ratios of right to wrong choices as exhibited in tables 5 and 6 indicate  smaller variations for the third problem than for the second.    Sobke made ten correct first choices in the third series for July 17,  but he was working very uncertainly and it seemed rather a matter of  good luck than good management that he succeeded in presenting this  perfect series: For this reason and also because it did not seem  feasible to have Sunday intervene between the final and perfect regular  series and the control series, an additional regular series was given on  July 19, in which, as the table indicates, a single mistake occurred, in  trial 5. The monkey was working perfectly. The series of trials required  only ten minutes, and it was evident that carelessness and eagerness to  obtain food were chiefly responsible for the mistake.    The control series given on July 19 immediately after the series just  described resulted similarly in one failure and nine successes. The  choices were made easily and with certainty, and the only mistake, that  of setting 7, was apparently due to carelessness.    This excellent showing for the control series wholly justifies the  comparison of problems 2 and 3 as to difficultness, made above. Whereas  in both problems 1 and 2 the control trials caused confusion, in the  case of problem 3, they did not essentially alter the behavior of the  animal. The fact seems to be that for this problem the particular  setting is of relatively little importance; while turning alternately to  the extreme left and the extreme right is of prime importance. That  Sobke had the idea of alternation or of the end box, there seems no more  reason for insisting than that he had the idea of secondness from the  right end in problem 2. It is possible, even probable, that these ideas  existed rather vaguely in his consciousness, but there is obviously no  necessity for insisting that the solution of the problems depended upon  them.      _Problem 4. Middle_    As the available time for the continuation of the experiment was  limited, it was decided to proceed with work on problem 4 immediately  upon the completion of problem 3, and on July 20, the problem of the  middle door was presented to Sobke. Since it was anticipated that this  sudden change would confuse and discourage him greatly, the only form of  punishment administered was the momentary lowering of the entrance door  of the wrong box. As in the previous problem, he was aided after ten  successive wrong choices. As might have been anticipated, he  persistently entered the end boxes of the groups, and this in some  instances probably would have been kept up for many minutes had not the  experimenter lured him into the right box by slightly raising the exit  door. In the first series, he had to be aided in five of the ten trials.  The total time for the series was forty-five minutes, the total number  of choices, eighty-eight. In the second series, he was aided in four of  the trials. The total time required was seventy-two minutes, and the  total number of choices was seventy-six.    Throughout the first series, "]]]
