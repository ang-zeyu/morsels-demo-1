Besides all this light of nature, and evidence of the Old Testament, for  the ruler's political punitive power for offences against God, there are  divers places in the New Testament showing that a civil punitive power  rests still in the civil magistrate: witness those general expressions  in those texts--Rom. xiii. 3, 4: \"Rulers are not a terror to good works,  but to the evil. If thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he  beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger  _to execute_ wrath upon him that doeth evil.\" 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14: \"Submit  yourselves unto every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it  be to the king as to the supreme, or unto governors which are sent for  the _punishment_ of evil-doers,[28] and the praise of them that do  well.\" Now, (as Mr. Burroughs[29] notes,) seeing the Scripture speaks  thus generally, except the nature of the thing require, why should we  distinguish where the Scripture doth not? so that these expressions may  be extended to those sorts of evil-doing against the first as well as  against the second table; against murdering of souls by heresy, as well  as murdering of men's bodies with the sword; against the blaspheming of  the God of heaven, as well as against blaspheming of kings and rulers,  that are counted gods on earth. That place seems to have much force in  it to this purpose, Heb. x. 28, 29: \"He that despised Moses' law, died  without mercy under two or three witnesses. Of how much sorer  punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden  under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant,  wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto  the Spirit of grace?\" Yea, what deserve such as deny the Spirit to be of  God? Papists exempt their clergy from the judgment of the civil power,  though they be delinquents against it; and their states, both civil  and spiritual, from civil taxes, tributes, and penalties, both which we  deny to ours: for, 1st, This is repugnant to the law of nature, that  church officers and members, as parts and members of the commonwealth,  should not be subject to the government of that commonwealth whereof  they are parts. 2d, Repugnant to the laws and practices of the Old  Testament, under which we read of no such exemptions. Yea, we have  instance of Abiathar the high-priest, who, for his partnership with  Adonijah in his rebellion, was exiled by king Solomon, and so  consequently deprived of the exercise of his office, 1 Kings ii. 26, 27.  3d, Inconsistent with our Saviour's example, who, as subject to the law,  held himself obliged to pay tribute to avoid offence, (Matt. xvii. 26,)  which was an active scandal; and he confesses Pilate's power to condemn  or release him was _given him from above_, John xix. 11. 4th, And  finally, contrary to the apostolical precepts, _enjoining all to be  subject to superior powers_, Rom. xiii. 1-4; 1 Pet. ii. 13-15.    Now, all the former power that is granted, or may be granted to the  magistrate about religion, is only cumulative and objective, as divines  used to express it; thus understand them:--    Cumulative, not privative; adding to, not detracting from any liberties  or privileges granted her from Christ. The heathen magistrate may be a  _nurse-father_, Isa. xlix. 23; 1 Tim. ii. 2, may not be a _step-father_:  may protect the Church, religion, &c., and order many things in a  political way about religion; may not extirpate or persecute the Church;  may help her in reformation; may not hinder her in reforming herself,  convening synods in herself, as in Acts xv., &c., if he will not help  her therein; otherwise her condition were better without than with a  magistrate. The Christian magistrate much less ought to hinder her  therein, otherwise her state were worse under the Christian than under  the pagan magistrate.    Objective or objectively ecclesiastical, as being exercised about  objects ecclesiastical, but politically, not ecclesiastically. His  proper power is _about_, not _in_ religious matters. He may politically,  outwardly exercise his power about objects or matters spiritual; but not  spiritually, inwardly, formally act any power in the Church. He may act  in church affairs as did Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah; not as did  Corah, Saul, Uzzah, or Uzziah. He is an overseer of things without, not  of things within. And in a word, his whole power about church offices  and religion is merely, properly, and formally civil or political.[30]    Nor is this only our private judgment, or the opinion of some few  particular persons touching the granting or bounding of the magistrate's  power about matters of religion; but with us we have the suffrage of  many reformed churches, who, in their Confessions of Faith published to  the world, do fully and clearly express themselves to the same effect.    The Helvetian church thus: Since every magistrate is of God, it is  (unless he would exercise tyranny) his chief duty, all blasphemy being  repressed, to defend and provide for religion, and to execute this to  his utmost strength, as the prophet teacheth out of the word; in which  respect the pure and free preaching of God's word, a right, diligent,  and well-instituted discipline of youth, citizens and scholars; a just  and liberal maintenance of the ministers of the church, and a solicitous  care of the poor, (whereunto all ecclesiastical means belong,) have the  first place. After this, &c.    The French churches thus: He also therefore committed the sword into the  magistrates' hands, that they might repress faults committed not only  against the second table, but also against the first; therefore we  affirm, that their laws and statutes ought to be obeyed, tribute to be  paid, and other burdens to be borne, the yoke of subjection voluntarily  to be undergone, yea, though the magistrates should be infidels, so long  as the supreme government of God remains perfect and untouched, Matt.  xxiv.; Acts iv. 17, and v. 19; Jude verse 8.    The church of Scotland thus: Moreover we affirm, that the purging and  conserving of religion is the first and most especial duty of kings,  princes, governors, and magistrates. So that they are ordained of God  not only for civil polity, but also for the conservation of true  religion, and that all idolatry and superstition may be suppressed: as  is evident in David, Jehoshaphat, Josiah, Hezekiah, and others, adorned  with high praises for their singular zeal.    The Belgic church thus: Therefore he hath armed the magistrates with a  sword, that they may punish the bad and defend the good. Furthermore, it  is their duty not only to be solicitous about preserving of civil  polity, but also to give diligence that the sacred ministry may be  preserved, all idolatry and adulterate worship of God may be taken out  of the way, the kingdom of antichrist may be pulled down, but Christ's  kingdom propagated. Finally, it is their part to take course, that the  holy word of the gospel be preached on every side, that all may freely  and purely serve and worship God according to the prescript of his word.  And all men, of whatsoever dignity, condition, or state they be, ought  to be subject to lawful magistrates, to pay them tribute and subsidies,  to obey them in all things which are not repugnant to the word of God;  to pour out prayers for them, that God would vouchsafe to direct them in  all their actions, _and that we may under them lead a quiet and  peaceable life in all godliness and honesty_. Wherefore we detest the  Anabaptists and all turbulent men who cast off superior dominions and  magistrates, pervert laws and judgments, make all goods common, and  finally abolish or confound all orders and degrees which God hath  constituted for honesty's sake among men.    The church in Bohemia thus: They teach also that it is commanded in the  word of God that _all should be subject to the higher powers_ in all  things, yet in those things only which are not repugnant to God and his  word. But as touching those things which concern men's souls, faith, and  salvation, they teach that men should hearken only to God's word, &c.,  his ministers, as Christ himself saith, _Render to Caesar the things  that are Caesar's, and to God those things that are God's._ But if any  would compel them to those things which are against God, and fight and  strive against his word, which abideth forever; they teach them to make  use of the apostle's example, who thus answered the magistrate at  Jerusalem: _It is meet_ (say they) _to obey God rather than men_.    Finally, the church in Saxony hath expressed herself notably in this  point, saying, among many other passages, God will have all men, yea,  even unregenerate men, to be ruled and restrained by political  government. And in this government the wisdom, justice, and goodness of  God to mankind do shine forth. His wisdom, order declares, which is the  difference of virtues and vices, and the consociation of men by lawful  governments and contracts ordained in wonderful wisdom. God's justice  also is seen in political government, who will have manifest  wickednesses to be punished by magistrates; and when they that rule  punish not the guilty, God himself wonderfully draws them to punishment,  and regularly punishes heinous faults with heinous penalties in this  life, as it is said, _He that takes the sword shall perish by the  sword_; and, _Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge_.

This was not broken, but a part of the bark was abraded, and even torn  up from the wood as if by the impact of some hard substance, as a stone  thrown with great force. He examined the ground, but there was no stone  visible, and on again looking at the bark he concluded that it had not  been done with a stone at all, because the abraded portion was not cut.  The blow had been delivered by something without edges or projections.  He had now no longer any doubt that the lesser branch outside had been  broken, and the large inside branch bruised, by the passage of a  Bushman's throw-club.    These, their only missile weapons, are usually made of crab-tree, and  consist of a very thin short handle, with a large, heavy, and smooth  knob. With these they can bring down small game, as rabbits or hares, or  a fawn (even breaking the legs of deer), or the large birds, as the  wood-turkeys. Stealing up noiselessly within ten yards, the Bushman  throws his club with great force, and rarely misses his aim. If not  killed at once, the game is certain to be stunned, and is much more  easily secured than if wounded with an arrow, for with an arrow in its  wing a large bird will flutter along the ground, and perhaps creep into  sedges or under impenetrable bushes.    Deprived of motion by the blow of the club, it can, on the other hand,  be picked up without trouble and without the aid of a dog, and if not  dead is despatched by a twist of the Bushman's fingers or a thrust from  his spud. The spud is at once his dagger, his knife and fork, his  chisel, his grub-axe, and his gouge. It is a piece of iron (rarely or  never of steel, for he does not know how to harden it) about ten inches  long, an inch and a half wide at the top or broadest end, where it is  shaped and sharpened like a chisel, only with the edge not straight but  sloping, and from thence tapering to a point at the other, the pointed  part being four-sided, like a nail.    It has, indeed, been supposed that the original spud was formed from a  large wrought-iron nail, such as the ancients used, sharpened on a stone  at one end, and beaten out flat at the other. This instrument has a  handle in the middle, half-way between the chisel end and the point. The  handle is of horn or bone (the spud being put through the hollow of the  bone), smoothed to fit the hand. With the chisel end he cuts up his game  and his food; the edge, being sloping, is drawn across the meat and  divides it. With this end, too, he fashions his club and his traps, and  digs up the roots he uses. The other end he runs into his meat as a  fork, or thrusts it into the neck of his game to kill it and let out the  blood, or with it stabs a sleeping enemy.    The stab delivered by the Bushman can always be distinguished, because  the wound is invariably square, and thus a clue only too certain has  often been afforded to the assassin of many an unfortunate hunter.  Whatever the Bushman in this case had hurled his club at, the club had  gone into the willow bush, snapping the light branch and leaving its  mark upon the bark of the larger. A moment's reflection convinced Felix  that the Bushman had been in chase of a pheasant. Only a few moments  previously a pheasant had flown before them down the track, and where  there was one pheasant there were generally several more in the  immediate neighbourhood.    The Bushmen were known to be peculiarly fond of the pheasant, pursuing  them all the year round without reference to the breeding season, and so  continuously, that it was believed they caused these birds to be much  less numerous, notwithstanding the vast extent of the forests, than they  would otherwise have been. From the fresh appearance of the snapped  bough, the Bushman must have passed but a few hours previously, probably  at the dawn, and was very likely concealed at that moment near at hand  in the forest, perhaps within a hundred yards.    Felix looked carefully round, but could see nothing; there were the  trees, not one of them large enough to hide a man behind it, the furze  branches were small and scattered, and there was not sufficient fern to  conceal anything. The keenest glance could discern nothing more. There  were no footmarks on the ground, indeed, the dry, dead leaves and fir  needles could hardly have received any impression, and up in the firs  the branches were thin, and the sky could be seen through them. Whether  the Bushman was lying in some slight depression of the ground, or  whether he had covered himself with dead leaves and fir needles, or  whether he had gone on and was miles away, there was nothing to show.  But of the fact that he had been there Felix was perfectly certain.    He returned towards Oliver, thoughtful and not without some anxiety, for  he did not like the idea (though there was really little or no danger)  of these human wild beasts being so near Aurora, while he should so soon  be far away. Thus occupied he did not heed his steps, and suddenly felt  something soft under his feet, which struggled. Instantaneously he  sprang as far as he could, shuddering, for he had crushed an adder, and  but just escaped, by his involuntary and mechanical leap, from its  venom.    In the warm sunshine the viper, in its gravid state, had not cared to  move as usual on hearing his approach; he had stepped full upon it. He  hastened from the spot, and rejoined Oliver in a somewhat shaken state  of mind. Common as such an incident was in the woods, where sandy soil  warned the hunter to be careful, it seemed ominous that particular  morning, and, joined with the discovery of Bushman traces, quite  destroyed his sense of the beauty of the day.    On hearing the condition of the willow boughs Oliver agreed as to the  cause, and said that they must remember to warn the Baron's shepherds  that the Bushmen, who had not been seen for some time, were about. Soon  afterwards they emerged from the sombre firs and crossed a wide and  sloping ground, almost bare of trees, where a forest fire last year had  swept away the underwood. A verdant growth of grass was now springing  up. Here they could canter side by side. The sunshine poured down, and  birds were singing joyously. But they soon passed it, and checked their  speed on entering the trees again.    Tall beeches, with round smooth trunks, stood thick and close upon the  dry and rising ground; their boughs met overhead, forming a green  continuous arch for miles. The space between was filled with brake fern,  now fast growing up, and the track itself was green with moss. As they  came into this beautiful place a red stag, startled from his browsing,  bounded down the track, his swift leaps carried him away like the wind;  in another moment he left the path and sprang among the fern, and was  seen only in glimpses as he passed between the beeches. Squirrels ran up  the trunks as they approached; they could see many on the ground in  among the trees, and passed under others on the branches high above  them. Woodpeckers flashed across the avenue.    Once Oliver pointed out the long, lean flank of a grey pig, or fern-hog,  as the animal rushed away among the brake. There were several glades,  from one of which they startled a few deer, whose tails only were seen  as they bounded into the underwood, but after the glades came the  beeches again. Beeches always form the most beautiful forest, beeches  and oak; and though nearing the end of their journey, they regretted  when they emerged from these trees and saw the castle before them.    The ground suddenly sloped down into a valley, beyond which rose the  Downs; the castle stood on a green isolated low hill, about half-way  across the vale. To the left a river wound past; to the right the beech  forest extended as far as the eye could see. The slope at their feet had  been cleared of all but a few hawthorn bushes. It was not enclosed, but  a neatherd was there with his cattle half a mile away, sitting himself  at the foot of a beech, while the cattle grazed below him.    Down in the valley the stockade began; it was not wide but long. The  enclosure extended on the left to the bank of the river, and two fields  on the other side of it. On the right it reached a mile and a half or  nearly, the whole of which was overlooked from the spot where they had  passed. Within the enclosures the corn crops were green and flourishing;  horses and cattle, ricks and various buildings, were scattered about it.  The town or cottages of the serfs were on the bank of the river  immediately beyond the castle. On the Downs, which rose a mile or more  on the other side of the castle, sheep were feeding; part of the ridge  was wooded and part open. Thus the cultivated and enclosed valley was  everywhere shut in with woods and hills.    The isolated round hill on which the castle stood was itself enclosed  with a second stockade; the edge of the brow above that again was  defended by a stout high wall of flints and mortar, crenellated at the  top. There were no towers or bastions. An old and ivy-grown building  stood inside the wall; it dated from the time of the ancients; it had  several gables, and was roofed with tiles. This was the dwelling-house.  The gardens were situated on the slope between the wall and the inner  stockade. Peaceful as the scene appeared, it had been the site of  furious fighting not many years ago. The Downs trended to the south,  where the Romany and the Zingari resided, and a keen watch was kept both  from the wall and from the hills beyond.    They now rode slowly down the slope, and in a few minutes reached the  barrier or gateway in the outer stockade. They had been observed, and  the guard called by the warden, but as they approached were recognised,  and the gate swang open before them. Walking their horses they crossed  to the hill, and were as easily admitted to the second"]]]
