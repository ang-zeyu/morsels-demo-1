What her beliefs were now I was wise enough to leave unquestioned, and  Frances, to my great relief, kept the conversation well away from such  inappropriate topics. It was clear, however, that the woman had in  herself some secret source of joy, that she was now an aggressive,  positive force, sure of herself, and apparently afraid of nothing in  heaven or hell. She radiated something very like hope and courage about  her, and talked as though the world were a glorious place and everybody  in it kind and beautiful. Her optimism was certainly infectious.    The Towers were mentioned only in passing. The name of Marsh came up--  not the Marsh, it so happened, but a name in some book that was being  discussed--and I was unable to restrain myself. Curiosity was too  strong. I threw out a casual enquiry Mabel could leave unanswered if she  wished. But there was no desire to avoid it. Her reply was frank and  smiling.    \"Would you believe it? She married,\" Mabel told me, though obviously  surprised that I remembered the housekeeper at all; \"and is happy as the  day is long. She's found her right niche in life. A sergeant--\"    \"The army!\" I ejaculated.    \"Salvation Army,\" she explained merrily.    Frances exchanged a glance with me. I laughed too, for the information  took me by surprise. I cannot say why exactly, but I expected at least  to hear that the woman had met some dreadful end, not impossibly by  burning.    \"And The Towers, now called the Rest House,\" Mabel chattered on, \"seems  to me the most peaceful and delightful spot in England--\"    \"Really,\" I said politely.    \"When I lived there in the old days--while you were there, perhaps,  though I won't be sure.\"    Mabel went on, \"the story got abroad that it was haunted. Wasn't it odd?  A less likely place for a ghost I've never seen. Why, it had no  atmosphere at all.\" She said this to Frances, glancing up at me with a  smile that apparently had no hidden meaning. \"Did you notice anything  queer about it when you were there?\"    This was plainly addressed to me.    \"I found it--er--difficult to settle down to anything,\" I said, after an  instant's hesitation. \"I couldn't work there--\"    \"But I thought you wrote that wonderful book on the Deaf and Blind while  you stayed with me,\" she asked innocently.    I stammered a little. \"Oh no, not then. I only made a few notes--er--at  The Towers. My mind, oddly enough, refused to produce at all down there.  But--why do you ask? Did anything--was anything supposed to happen  there?\"    She looked searchingly into my eyes a moment before she answered:    \"Not that I know of,\" she said simply."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'!

Give him a new toy and he wants to take it to bed with  him. Ever notice?\"    \"Surely.\"    \"That's the way with me. When I go to bed nothin' matters with me except  that I have my lariat around. I generally like to have it hangin' on a  nail at the head of my bunk. The fellers always laugh at me, but I can't  help it; makes me feel more at home.\"    And with that, still smiling at his own folly in a rather shamefaced  way, he turned in the blankets and dropped the big coil of the lariat  over a nail which projected from the boards just over the head of his  bunk. The noose was outermost and could be disengaged from the nail by a  single twist of the cowpuncher's hand as he lay passive in the bunk.    On this noose Bard cast a curious eye. To cityfolk a piece of rope is a  harmless thing with which one may make a trunk secure or on occasion  construct a clothes line on the roof of the apartment building, or in  the kitchen on rainy Mondays.    To a sailor the rope is nothing and everything at once. Give a seaman  even a piece of string and he will amuse himself all evening making  lashings and knots. A piece of rope calls up in his mind the stout lines  which hold the masts steady and the yards true in the gale, the  comfortable cable which moors the ship at the end of the dreary voyage,  and a thousand things between.    To the Westerner a rope is a different thing. It is not so much a useful  material as a weapon. An Italian, fighting man to man, would choose a  knife; a Westerner would take in preference that same harmless piece of  rope. In his hands it takes on life, it gains a strange and sinister  quality. One instant it lies passive, or slowly whirled in a careless  circle--the next its noose darts out like the head of a striking cobra,  the coil falls and fastens, and then it draws tighter and tighter,  remorselessly as a boa constrictor, paralyzing life.    Something of all this went through the mind of Bard as he lay watching  the limp noose of the cowboy's lariat, and then he nodded smiling.    \"I suppose that seems an odd habit to some men, but I sympathize with  it. I have it myself, in fact. And whenever I'm out in the wilds and  carry a gun I like to have it under my head when I sleep. That's even  queerer than your fancy, isn't it?\"    And he slipped his revolver under the blankets at the head of his bunk.          CHAPTER XIX      THE CANDLE    \"Yes,\" said Nash, \"that's a queer stunt, because when you're lyin' like  that with your head right over the gun and the blankets in between, it'd  take you a couple of seconds to get it out.\"    \"Not when you're used to it. You'd be surprised to see how quickly a man  can get the gun out from under.\"    \"That so?\"    \"Yes, and shooting while you're lying on your back is pretty easy, too,  when you've had practice.\"    \"Sure, with a rifle, but not with a revolver.\"    \"Well, do you see that bit of paper in the corner there up on the  rafter?\"    \"Yes.\"    The hand of Bard whipped under his head, there was a gleam and whirl of  steel, an explosion, and the bit of paper came fluttering slowly down  from the rafter, like a wounded bird struggling to keep upon the air. A  draft caught the paper just before it landed and whirled it through the  doorless entrance and out into the night.    He was yawning as he restored the gun beneath the blanket, but from the  corner of his eye he saw the hardening of Nash's face, a brief change  which came and went like the passing of a shadow.    \"That's something I'll remember,\" drawled the cowpuncher.    \"You ought to,\" answered the other quickly, \"it comes in handy now and  then.\"    \"Feel sleepy?\"    The candle guttered and flickered on the floor midway between the two  bunks, and Bard, glancing to it, was about to move from his bed and  snuff it; but at the thought of so doing it seemed to him as if he could  almost sense with prophetic mind the upward dart of the noose about his  shoulders. He edged a little lower in the blankets.    \"Not a bit. How about you?\"    \"Me? I most generally lie awake a while and gab after I hit the hay.  Makes me sleep better afterward.\"    \"I do the same thing when I've any one who listens to me--or talks to  me.\"    \"Queer how many habits we got the same, eh?\"    \"It is. But after all, most of us are more alike than we care to  imagine.\"    \"Yes, there ain't much difference; sometimes the difference ain't as  much as a split-second watch would catch, but it may mean that one  feller passes out and the other goes on.\"    They lay half facing each other, each with his head pillowed on an arm.    \"By Jove! lucky we reached this shelter before the rain came.\"    \"Yep. A couple of hours of this and the rivers will be up--may take up  all day to get back to the ranch if we have to ride up to the ford on  the Saverack.\"    \"Then we'll swim 'em.\"    The other smiled drily.    \"Swim the Saverack when she's up? No, lad, we won't do that.\"    \"Then I'll have to work it alone, I suppose. You see, I have that date  in Eldara for tomorrow night.\"    Nash set his teeth, to choke back the cough. He produced papers and  tobacco, rolled a cigarette with lightning speed, lighted it, and  inhaled a long puff.    \"Sure, you ought to keep that date, but maybe Sally would wait till the  night after.\"    \"She impressed me, on the whole, as not being of the waiting kind.\"    \"H-m! A little delay does 'em good; gives 'em a chance to think.\"    \"Why, every man has his own way with women, I suppose, but my idea is,  keep them busy--never give them a chance to think. If you do, they  generally waste the chance and forget you altogether.\"    Another coughing spell overtook Nash and left him frowning down at the  glowing end of his butt.    \"She ain't like the rest.\"    \"I wonder?\" mused the Easterner.    He had an infinite advantage in this duel of words, for he could watch  from under the shadow of his long, dark lashes the effect of his  speeches on the cowboy, yet never seem to be looking. For he was  wondering whether the enmity of Nash, which he felt as one feels an  unknown eye upon him in the dark, came from their rivalry about the  girl, or from some deeper cause. He was inclined to think that the girl  was the bottom of everything, but he left his mind open on the subject.    And Nash, pondering darkly and silently, measured the strength of the  slender stranger and felt that if he were the club the other was the  knife which made less sound but might prove more deadly. Above all he  was conscious of the Easterner's superiority of language, which might  turn the balance against him in the ear of Sally Fortune. He dropped  the subject of the girl.    \"You was huntin' over on the old place on the other side of the range?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Pretty fair run of game?\"    \"Rather.\"    \"I think you said something about Logan?\"    \"Did I? I've been thinking a good deal about him. He gave me the wrong  tip about the way to Eldara. When I get back to the old place--\"    \"Well?\"    The other smiled unpleasantly and made a gesture as if he were snapping  a twig between his hands.    \"I'll break him in two.\"    The eyes of Nash grew wide with astonishment; he was remembering that  same phrase on the lips of the big, grey man, Drew.    He murmured: \"That may give you a little trouble. Logan's a peaceable  chap, but he has his record before he got down as low as sheepherdin'.\"    \"I like trouble--now and then.\"    A pause.    \"Odd old shack over there.\"    \"Drew's old house?\"    \"Yes. There's a grave in front of it.\"    \"And there's quite a yarn inside the grave.\"    The cowpuncher was aware that the other stirred--not much, but as if he  winced from a drop of cold water; he felt that he was close on the trail  of the real reason why the Easterner wished to see Drew.    \"A story about Drew's wife?\"    \"You read the writing on the headstone, eh?\"    \"'Joan, she chose this place for rest,'\" quoted Bard.    \"That was all before my time; it was before the time of any others in  these parts, but a few of the grey-beards know a bit about the story and  I've gathered a little of it from Drew, though he ain't much of a  talker.\"    \"I'd like to hear it.\"    Sensitively aware of Bard, as a photographic plate is aware of light on  exposures, the cowpuncher went on with the tale.    And Bard, his glance probing among the shadowy rafters of the room,  seemed to be searching there for the secret on whose trail he rode.  Through the interims the rain crashed and volleyed on the roof above  them; the cold spray whipped down on them through the cracks; the wind  shook and rattled the crazy house; and the drawling voice of Nash went  on and on.          CHAPTER XX      JOAN    \"Them were the days when this was a man's country, which a man could  climb on his hoss with a gun and a rope and touch heaven and hell in one  day's ridin'. Them good old days ain't no more. I've heard the old man  tell about 'em. Now they've got everybody stamped and branded with law  an' order, herded together like cattle, ticketed, done for. That's the  way the range is now. The marshals have us by the throat. In the old  days a sheriff that outlived his term was probably crooked and runnin'  hand in hand with the long-riders.\"    \"Long-riders?\" queried Bard.    \"Fellers that got tired of workin' and took to ridin' for their livin'.  Mostly they worked in little gangs of five and six. They was called  long-riders, I guess, partly because they was in the saddle all the  time, and partly because they done their jobs so far apart. They'd ride  into Eldara and blow up the safe in the bank one day, for instance, and  five days later they'd be two hundred and fifty miles away stoppin' a  train at Lewis Station.    \"They never hung around no one part of the"]]]
