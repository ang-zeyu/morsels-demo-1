Well, good-by!\"    He found gigantic arms spreading before him.    \"Andy,\" insisted the big man, \"it ain't too late for me to double-cross  'em. Let me go out first and you come straight behind me. They won't  fire; they'll think I've got a new plan for givin' you up. When we get  to the circle of 'em, because they're all round the cabin, we'll drive  at 'em together. Come on!\"    \"Wait a minute. Is Hal Dozier out there?\"    \"Yes. Oh, go on and curse me, Andy. I'm cursin' myself!\"    \"If he's there, it's no use. But there's no use two dyin' when I try to  get through. Only one thing, Hank; if you want to keep your self-respect  don't take the reward money.\"    \"I'll see it burn first, and I'm goin' with you, Andy!\"    \"You stay where you are; this is my party. Before the finish of the  dance I'm going to see if some of those sneaks out yonder, lyin' so  snug, won't like to step right out and do a caper with me!\"    And before the trapper could make a protest he had drawn back into the  horse shed.    There he led the chestnut to the door, and, looking through the crack,  he scanned the surface of the ground. It was sadly broken and chopped  with rocks, but the gelding might make headway fast enough. It was a  short distance to the trees--twenty-five to forty yards, perhaps. And if  he burst out of that shed on the back of the horse, spurred to full  speed, he might take the watchers, who perhaps expected a signal from  the trapper before they acted, quite unawares, and he would be among the  sheltering shadows of the forest while the posse was getting up  its guns.    There was an equally good chance that he would ride straight into a nest  of the waiting men, and, even if he reached the forest, he would be  riddled with bullets.    Now, all these thoughts and all this weighing of the chances occupied  perhaps half a second, while Andrew stood looking through the crack.  Then he swung into the saddle, leaning far over to the side so that he  would have clearance under the doorway, kicked open the swinging door,  and sent the chestnut leaping into the night.          CHAPTER 22      If only the night had been dark, if the gelding had had a fair start;  but the moon was bright, and in the thin mountain air it made a radiance  almost as keen as day and just sufficiently treacherous to delude a  horse, which had been sent unexpectedly out among rocks by a cruel pair  of spurs. At the end of the first leap the gelding stumbled to his knees  with a crash and snort among the stones. The shock hurled Andrew  forward, but he clung with spurs and hand, and as he twisted back into  the saddle the gelding rose valiantly and lurched ahead again.    Yet that double sound might have roused an army, and for the keen-eared  watchers around the clearing it was more than an ample warning. There  was a crash of musketry so instant and so close together that it was  like a volley delivered by a line of soldiers at command. Bullets sang  shrill and small around Andrew, but that first discharge had been a  burst of snap-shooting, and by moonlight it takes a rare man indeed to  make an accurate snapshot. The first discharge left both Andrew and the  horse untouched, and for the moment the wild hope of unexpected success  was raised in his heart. And he had noted one all-important fact--the  flashes, widely scattered as they were, did not extend across the exact  course of his flight toward the trees. Therefore, none of the posse  would have a point-blank shot at him. For those in the rear and on the  sides the weaving course of the gelding, running like a deer and  swerving agilely among the rocks, as if to make up for his first  blunder, offered the most difficult of all targets.    All this in only the space of a breath, yet the ground was already  crossed and the trees were before him when Andrew saw a ray of  moonlight flash on the long barrel of rifle to his right, and he knew  that one man at least was taking a deliberate aim. He had his revolver  on the fellow in the instant, and yet he held his fire. God willing, he  would come back to Anne Withero with no more stains on his hands!    And that noble, boyish impulse killed the chestnut, for a moment later a  stream of fire spouted out, long and thin, from the muzzle of the rifle,  and the gelding struck at the end of a stride, like a ship going down in  the sea; his limbs seemed to turn to tallow under him, and he crumpled  on the ground.    The fall flung Andrew clean out of the saddle; he landed on his knees  and leaped for the woods, but now there was a steady roar of guns behind  him. He was struck heavily behind the left shoulder, staggered.  Something gashed his neck like the edge of a red-hot knife, his whole  left side was numb.    And then the merciful dark of the trees closed around him.    For fifty yards he raced through an opening in the trees, while a  yelling like wild Indians rose behind him; then he leaped into cover and  waited. One thing favored him still. They had not brought horses, or at  least they had left their mounts at some distance, for fear of the  chance noises they might make when the cabin was stalked. And now,  looking down the lane among the trees, he saw men surge into it.    All his left side was covered with a hot bath, but, balancing his  revolver in his right hand, he felt a queer touch of joy and pride at  finding his nerve still unshaken. He raised the weapon, covered their  bodies, and then something like an invisible hand forced down the muzzle  of his gun. He could not shoot to kill!    He did what was perhaps better; he fired at that mass of legs, and even  a child could not have failed to strike the target. Once, twice, and  again; then the crowd melted to either side of the path, and there was a  shrieking and forms twisting and writhing on the ground.    Some one was shouting orders from the side; he was ordering them to the  right and left to surround the fugitive; he was calling out that Lanning  was hit. At least, they would go with caution down his trail after that  first check. He left his sheltering tree and ran again down the ravine.    By this time the first shock of the wounds and the numbness were leaving  him, but the pain was terrible. Yet he knew that he was not fatally  injured if he could stop that mortal drain of his wounds.    He heard the pursuit in the distance more and more. Every now and then  there was a spasmodic outburst of shooting, and Andrew grinned in spite  of his pain. They were closing around the place where they thought he  was making his last stand, shooting at shadows which might be the man  they wanted.    Then he stopped, tore off his shirt, and ripped it with his right hand  and his teeth into strips. He tied one around his neck, knotting it  until he could only draw his breath with difficulty. Several more strips  he tied together, and then wound the long bandage around his shoulder  and pulled. The pain brought him close to a swoon, but when his senses  cleared he found that the flow from his wounds had eased.    But not entirely. There was still some of that deadly trickling down his  side, and, with the chill of the night biting into him, he knew that it  was life or death to him if he could reach some friendly house within  the next two miles. There was only one dwelling straight before him, and  that was the house of the owner of the bay mare. They would doubtless  turn him over to the posse instantly. But there was one chance in a  hundred that they would not break the immemorial rule of mountain  hospitality. For Andrew there was no hope except that tenuous one.    The rest of that walk became a nightmare. He was not sure whether he  heard the yell of rage and disappointment behind him as the posse  discovered that the bird had flown or whether the sound existed only in  his own ringing head. But one thing was certain--they would not trail  Andrew Lanning recklessly in the night, not even with the moon to  help them.    So he plodded steadily on. If it had not been for that ceaseless drip he  would have taken the long chance and broken for the mountains above him,  trying through many a long day ahead to cure the wounds and in some  manner sustain his life. But the drain continued. It was hardly more  than drop by drop, but all the time a telltale weakness was growing in  his legs. In spite of the agony he was sleepy, and he would have liked  to drop on the first mat of leaves that he found.    That crazy temptation he brushed away, and went on until surely, like a  star of hope, he saw the light winking feebly through the trees, and  then came out on the cabin.    He remembered afterward that even in his dazed condition he was  disappointed because of the neat, crisp, appearance of the house. There  must be women there, and women meant screams, horror, betrayal.    But there was no other hope for him now. Twice, as he crossed the  clearing before he reached the door of the cabin, his foot struck a rock  and he pitched weakly forward, with only the crumbling strength of his  right arm to keep him from striking on his face. Then there was a  furious clamor and a huge dog rushed at him.    He heeded it only with a glance from the corner of his eye. And then,  his dull brain clearing, he realized that the dog no longer howled at  him or showed his teeth, but was walking beside him, licking his hand  and whining with sympathy. He dropped again, and this time he could  never have regained his feet had not his right arm flopped helplessly  across the back of the big dog, and the beast cowered and growled, but  it did not attempt to slide from under his weight.    He managed to get erect again, but when he reached the low flight of  steps to the front door he was reeling drunkenly from side to side. He  fumbled for the knob, and it turned with a grating sound.    \"Hold on! Keep out!\" shrilled a voice inside. \"We got guns here. Keep  out, you dirty bum!\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],[0,"Black Jack (#18)"],[1,"on her, Terry remained standing in the middle of the  room watching the flame in the oil lamp she had lighted flare and rise at  the corner, and then steady down to an even line of yellow; but he was  not seeing it; he was listening to that peculiar silence in the house. It  seemed to have spread over the entire village, and he heard no more of  those casual noises which he had noticed on his coming.    He went to the window and raised it to let whatever wind was abroad enter  the musty warmth of the room. He raised the sash with stealthy caution,  wondering at his own stealthiness. And he was oddly glad when the window  rose without a squeak. He leaned out and looked up and down the street.  It was unchanged. Across the way a door flung open, a child darted out  with shrill laughter and dodged about the corner of the house, escaping  after some mischief.    After that the silence again, except that before long a murmur began on  the veranda beneath him where the half-dozen obscure figures had been  sitting when he entered. Why should they be mumbling to themselves? He  thought he could distinguish the voice of the widow Rickson among the  rest, but he shrugged that idle thought away and turned back into his  room. He sat down on the side of the bed and pulled off his boots, but  the minute they were off he was ill at ease. There was something  oppressive about the atmosphere of this rickety old hotel. What sort of a  world was this he had entered, with its whispers, its cold glances?    He cast himself back on his bed, determined to be at ease. Nevertheless,  his heart kept bumping absurdly. Now, Terry began to grow angry. With the  feeling that there was danger in the air of Craterville--for him--there  came a nervous setting of the muscles, a desire to close on someone and  throttle the secret of this hostility. At this point he heard a light  tapping at the door. Terry sat bolt upright on the bed.    There are all kinds of taps. There are bold, heavy blows on the door that  mean danger without; there are careless, conversational rappings; but  this was a furtive tap, repeated after a pause as though it contained a  code message.    First there was a leap of fear--then cold quiet of the nerves. He was  surprised at himself. He found himself stepping into whatever adventure  lay toward him with the lifting of the spirits. It was a stimulus.    He called cheerfully: \"Come in!\"    And the moment he had spoken he was off the bed, noiselessly, and half  the width of the room away. It had come to him as he spoke that it might  be well to shift from the point from which his voice had been heard.    The door opened swiftly--so swiftly was it opened and closed that it made  a faint whisper in the air, oddly like a sigh. And there was no click of  the lock either in the opening or the closing. Which meant an  incalculably swift and dexterous manipulation with the fingers. Terry  found himself facing a short-throated man with heavy shoulders; he wore a  shapeless black hat bunched on his head as though the whole hand had  grasped the crown and shoved the hat into place. It sat awkwardly to one  side. And the hat typified the whole man. There was a sort of shifty  readiness about him. His eyes flashed in the lamplight as they glanced at  the bed, and then flicked back toward Terry. And a smile began somewhere  in his face and instantly went out. It was plain that he had understood  the maneuver.    He continued to survey Terry insolently for a moment without announcing  himself. Then he stated: \"You're him, all right!\"    \"Am I?\" said Terry, regarding this unusual visitor with increasing  suspicion. \"But I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.\"    The big-shouldered man raised a stubby hand. He had an air of one who  deprecates, and at the same time lets another into a secret. He moved  across the room with short steps that made no sound, and gave him a  peculiar appearance of drifting rather than walking. He picked up a chair  and placed it down on the rug beside the bed and seated himself in it.    Aside from the words he had spoken, since he entered the room he had made  no more noise than a phantom.    \"You're him, all right,\" he repeated, balancing back in the chair. But he  gathered his toes under him, so that he remained continually poised in  spite of the seeming awkwardness of his position.    \"Who am I?\" asked Terry.    \"Why, Black Jack's kid. It's printed in big type all over you.\"    His keen eyes continued to bore at Terry as though he were striving to  read features beneath a mask. Terry could see his visitor's face more  clearly now. It was square, with a powerfully muscled jaw and features  that had a battered look. Suddenly he teetered forward in his chair and  dropped his elbows aggressively on his knees.    \"D'you know what they're talking about downstairs?\"    \"Haven't the slightest idea.\"    \"You ain't! The old lady is trying to fix up a bad time for you.\"    \"She's raising a crowd?\"    \"Doing her best. I dunno what it'll come to. The boys are stirring a  little. But I think it'll be all words and no action. Four-flushers, most  of 'em. Besides, they say you bumped old Minter for a goal; and they  don't like the idea of messing up with you. They'll just talk. If they  try anything besides their talk--well, you and me can fix 'em!\"    Terry slipped into the only other chair which the room provided, but he  slid far down in it, so that his holster was free and the gun butt  conveniently under his hand.    \"You seem a charitable sort,\" he said. \"Why do you throw in with me?\"    \"And you don't know who I am?\" said the other.    He chuckled noiselessly, his mouth stretching to remarkable proportions.    \"I'm sorry,\" said Terry.    \"Why, kid, I'm Denver. I'm your old man's pal, Denver! I'm him that done  the Silver Junction job with old Black Jack, and a lot more jobs, when  you come to that!\"    He laughed again. \"They were getting sort of warm for me out in the big  noise. So I grabbed me a side-door Pullman and took a trip out to the old  beat. And think of bumping into Black Jack's boy right off the bat!\"    He became more sober. \"Say, kid, ain't you got a glad hand for me? Ain't  you ever heard Black Jack talk?\"    \"He died,\" said Terry soberly, \"before I was a year old.\"    \"The hell!\" murmured the other. \"The hell! Poor kid. That was a rotten  lay, all right. If I'd known about that, I'd of--but I didn't. Well, let  it go. Here we are together. And you're the sort of a sidekick I need.  Black Jack, we're going to trim this town to a fare-thee-well!\"    \"My name is Hollis,\" said Terry. \"Terence Hollis.\"    \"Terence hell,\" snorted the other. \"You're Black Jack's kid, ain't you?  And ain't his moniker good enough for you to work under? Why, kid, that's  a trademark most of us would give ten thousand cash for!\"    He broke off and regarded Terry with a growing satisfaction.    \"You're his kid, all right. This is just the way Black Jack would of  sat--cool as ice--with a gang under him talking about stretching his  neck. And now, bo, hark to me sing! I got the job fixed and--But wait a  minute. What you been doing all these years? Black Jack was known when he  was your age!\"    With a peculiar thrill of awe and of aversion Terry watched the face of  the man who had known his father so well. He tried to make himself  believe that twenty-four years ago Denver might have been quite another  type of man. But it was impossible to re-create that face other than as a  bulldog in the human flesh. The craft and the courage of a fighter were  written large in those features.    \"I've been leading--a quiet life,\" he said gently.    The other grinned. \"Sure--quiet,\" he chuckled. \"And then you wake up and  bust Minter for your first crack. You began late, son, but you may go  far. Pretty tricky with the gat, eh?\"    He nodded in anticipatory admiration.    \"Old Minter had a name. Ain't I had my run-in with him? He was smooth  with a cannon. And fast as a snake's tongue. But they say you beat him  fair and square. Well, well, I call that a snappy start in the world!\"    Terry was silent, but his companion refused to be chilled.    \"That's Black Jack over again,\" he said. \"No wind about what he'd done.  No jabber about what he was going to do. But when you wanted something  done, go to Black Jack. Bam! There it was done clean for you and no talk  afterward. Oh, he was a bird, was your old man. And you take after him,  right enough!\"    A voice rose in Terry. He wanted to argue. He wanted to explain. It was  not that he felt any consuming shame because he was the son of Black Jack  Hollis. But there was a sort of foster parenthood to which he owed a  clean-minded allegiance--the fiction of the Colby blood. He had  worshipped that thought for twenty years. He could not discard it in an  instant.    Denver was breezing on in his quick, husky voice, so carefully toned that  it barely served to reach Terry.    \"I been waiting for a pal like you, kid. And here's where we hit it off.  You don't know much about the game, I guess? Neither did Black Jack. As a  peterman he was a loud ha-ha; as a damper-getter he was just an amateur;  as a heel or a houseman, well, them things were just outside him. When it  come to the gorilla stuff, he was there a million, though. And when there  was a call for fast, quick, soft work, Black Jack was the man. Kid, I can  see that you're cut right on his pattern. And here's where you come in  with me. Right off the bat there's going to be velvet. Later on I'll  educate you. In three months you'll be worth your salt. Are you on?\"    He hardly waited for Terry to reply. He rambled on.    \"I got a plant that can't fail to blossom into the long green, kid. The  store safe. You know what's in it? I'll tell you. Ten thousand cold. Ten  thousand bucks, boy. Well, well, and how did it get there? Because a lot  of the boobs around here have put their spare cash in the safe for  safekeeping!\"    He "]]]
