A quiet conversation  with his dearly loved friend and master had assured him in the  confidence of innocence, and though the color on his cheek had through  excitement sunk into two bright red spots, he looked wonderfully noble  and winning as he stood before the boys in the centre of the room. His  appearance caused a little reaction in his favor, and a murmur of  applause followed his answer.    \"Good,\" said Avonley; \"who will prosecute on the part of the school?\"    There was a pause. Nobody seemed to covet the office.    \"Very well; if no one is willing to prosecute, the charge drops.\"    \"I will do it,\" said Gibson, a Rowlandite, one of the study boys at the  top of the fifth form. He was a clever fellow, and Eric liked the little  he had seen of him.    \"Have you any objection, Williams, to the jury being composed of the  sixth form? or are there any names among them which you wish to  challenge?\"    \"No,\" said Eric, glancing round with confidence.    \"Well, now, who will defend the accused?\"    Another pause, and Upton got up.    \"No,\" said Eric, at once. \"You were inclined to distrust me, Upton, and  I will only be defended by somebody who never doubted my innocence.\"    Another pause followed, and then, blushing crimson, Russell got up. \"I  am only a Shell-boy,\" he said, \"but if Eric doesn't mind trusting his  cause to me, I will defend him, since no other fifth-form fellow stirs.\"    \"Thank you, Russell, _I wanted_ you to offer, I could wish no better  defender.\"    \"Will Owen, Duncan, and Montagu help me, if they can?\" asked Russell.    \"Very willingly,\" they all three said, and went to take their seats by  him. They conversed eagerly for a few minutes, and then declared  themselves ready.    \"All I have got to do,\" said Gibson, rising, \"is to bring before the  school the grounds for suspecting Williams, and all the evidence which  makes it probable that he is the offender. Now, first of all, the thing  must have been done between Friday evening and Saturday morning; and  since the school-room door is generally locked soon after school, it was  probably done in the short interval between six and a quarter past. I  shall now examine some witnesses.\"    The first boy called upon was Pietrie, who deposed, that on Friday  evening, when he left the room, having been detained a few minutes, the  only boy remaining in it was Williams.    Carter, the school-servant, was then sent for, and deposed, that he had  met Master Williams hastily running out of the room, when he went at a  quarter past six to lock the door.    Examined by Gibson.--\"Was any boy in the room when you did lock the  door?\"    \"No one.\"    \"Did you meet any one else in the passage?\"    \"No.\"    Cross-examined by Russell.--\"Do boys ever get into the room after the  door is locked?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"By what means?\"    \"Through the side windows.\"    \"That will do.\"    Russell here whispered something to Duncan, who at once left the room,  and on returning, after a few minutes' absence, gave Russell a  significant nod.    Barker was next brought forward, and questioned by Gibson.    \"Do you know that Williams is in the habit of using a particular kind of  ink?\"    \"Yes; it is of a violet color, and has a peculiar smell.\"    \"Could you recognise anything written with it?\"    \"Yes.\"    Gibson here handed to Barker the paper which had caused so much trouble.    \"Is that the kind of ink?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you know the handwriting on that paper?\"    \"Yes; it is Williams' hand.\"    \"How can you tell?\"    \"He makes his r's in a curious way.\"    \"Turn the paper over. Have you ever seen those kind of wafers before?\"    \"Yes; Williams has a box of them in his desk.\"    \"Has any other boy, that you are aware of, wafers like those?\"    \"No.\"    Cross-examined by Duncan.--\"_How_ do you know that Williams has wafers  like those?\"    \"I have seen him use them.\"    \"For what purpose?\"    \"To fasten letters.\"    \"I can't help remarking that you seem very well acquainted with what he  does. Several of those who know him best, and have seen him oftenest,  never heard of these wafers. May I ask,\" he said, \"if any one else in  the school will witness to having seen Williams use these wafers?\"    No one spoke, and Barker, whose malice seemed to have been changed into  uneasiness, sat down.    Upton was the next witness. Gibson began--\"You have seen a good deal of  Williams?\"    \"Yes,\" said Upton smiling.    \"Have you ever heard him express any opinion of Mr. Gordon?\"    \"Often.\"    \"Of what kind?\"    \"Dislike and contempt,\" said Upton, amidst general laughter.    \"Have you ever heard him say anything which implied a desire to injure  him?\"    \"The other day Mr. Gordon gave him a Georgic as an imposition, and I  heard Williams say that he would like to pay him out.\"    This last fact was new to the school, and excited a great sensation.    \"When did he say this?\"    \"On Friday afternoon.\"    Upton had given his evidence with great reluctance, although, being  simply desirous that the truth should come out, he concealed nothing  that he knew. He brightened up a little when Russell rose to  cross-examine him.    \"Have you ever known Williams to do any mean act?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Do you consider him a boy _likely_ to have been guilty on this  occasion?\"    \"Distinctly the reverse. I am convinced of his innocence.\"    The answer was given with vehement emphasis, and Eric felt greatly  relieved by it.    One or two other boys were then called on as witnesses to the great  agitation which Eric had shown during the investigation in the  school-room, and then Gibson, who was a sensible, self-contained fellow,  said, \"I have now done my part. I have shown that the accused had a  grudge against Mr. Gordon at the time of the occurrence, and had  threatened to be revenged on him; that he was the last boy in the room  during the time when the offence must have been committed; that the  handwriting is known to resemble his, and that the ink and wafers  employed were such as he, and he only, was known to possess. In addition  to all this, his behavior, when the matter was first publicly noticed,  was exactly such as coincides with the supposition of his guilt. I think  you will all agree in considering these grounds of suspicion very  strong; and leaving them to carry their full weight with you, I close  the case for the prosecution.\"    The school listened to Gibson's quiet formality with a kind of grim and  gloomy satisfaction, and when he had concluded, there were probably few  but Eric's own immediate friends who were not fully convinced of his  guilt, however sorry they might be to admit so unfavorable an opinion of  a companion whom they all admired.    After a minute or two, Russell rose for the defence, and asked, \"Has  Williams any objection to his desk being brought, and any of its  contents put in as evidence?\"    \"Not the least; there is the key, and you will find it in my place in  school.\"    The desk was brought, but it was found to be already unlocked, and  Russell looked at some of the note-paper which it contained. He then  began--\"In spite of the evidence adduced, I think I can show that  Williams is not guilty. It is quite true that he dislikes Mr. Gordon,  and would not object to any open way of showing it; it is quite true  that he used the expressions attributed to him, and that the ink and  wafers are such as may be found in his desk, and that the handwriting is  not unlike his. But is it probable that a boy intending to post up an  insult such as this, would do so in a manner, and at a time so likely to  involve him in immediate detection, and certain punishment? At any rate,  he would surely disguise his usual handwriting. Now, I ask any one to  look at this paper, and tell me whether it is not clear, on the  contrary, that these letters were traced slowly and with care, as would  be the case with an elaborate attempt to imitate?\" Russell here handed  the paper to the jury, who again narrowly examined it.    \"Now the evidence of Pietrie and Carter is of no use, because Carter  himself admitted that boys often enter the room by the window; a fact to  which we shall have to allude again.    \"We admit the evidence about the ink and wafers. But it is rather  strange that Barker should know about the wafers, since neither I, nor  any other friend of Williams, often as we have sat by him when writing  letters, have ever observed that he possessed any like them.\"    Several boys began to look at Barker, who was sitting very ill at ease  on the corner of a form, in vain trying to appear unconcerned.    \"There is another fact which no one yet knows, but which I must mention.  It will explain Williams' agitation when Dr. Rowlands read out the words  on that paper; and, confident of his innocence, I am indifferent to its  appearing to tell against him. I myself once heard Williams use the very  words written on that paper, and not only heard them, but expostulated  with him strongly for the use of them. I need hardly say how very  unlikely it is, that remembering this, he should thus publicly draw my  suspicions on him, if he meant to insult Mr. Gordon, undiscovered. But,  besides myself, there was another boy who accidentally overheard that  expression. That boy was Barker.    \"I have to bring forward a new piece of evidence which at least ought to  go for something. Looking at this half-sheet of note-paper, I see that  the printer's name on the stamp in the corner is 'Graves, York.' Now, I  have just found that there is no paper at all like this in Williams'  desk; all the note-paper it contains is marked 'Blakes, Ayrton.'    \"I might bring many witnesses to prove how very unlike Williams' general  character a trick of this kind would be. But I am not going to do this.  We think we know the real offender. We have had one trial, and now  demand another.

But these  have been, and should always be, kept completely distinct. [It is a  condition with the Society of Arts, never to give a reward to any thing  for which a patent has been, or is to be, taken out.]    Let us now consider the case of platina. A new process was discovered of  rendering it malleable, and the mere circumstance of so large a quantity  having been sent into the market, was a positive benefit, of no ordinary  magnitude, to many of the arts. The discoverer of this valuable process  selected that course for which no reasonable man could blame him;  and from some circumstance, or perhaps from accident, he preserved no  written record of the manipulations. Had Providence appointed for that  disorder, which terminated too fatally, a more rapid career, all the  knowledge he had acquired from the long attention he had devoted to the  subject, would have been lost to mankind. The hand of a friend recorded  the directions of the expiring philosopher, whose anxiety to render  useful even his unfinished speculations, proves that the previous  omission was most probably accidental.    Under such circumstances it was published to the world in the  Transactions of the Royal Society. But what could induce that body  to bestow on it their medal? To talk of adding lustre to the name of  Wollaston by their medal, is to talk idly. They must have done it then  as an example, as a stimulus to urge future inquiries in the career of  discovery. But did they wish discoveries to be so endangered?    The discoveries of Professor Mitscherlick, of Berlin, had long been  considered, by a few members of the Society, as having strong claims on  one of its honorary rewards; but difficulties had arisen, from so few  members of the Council having any knowledge of discoveries which had  long been familiar to Europe. The Council were just on the point of  doing justice to the merits of the Prussian philosopher, when it was  suggested that its medal should be given to Dr. Wollaston, and they  immediately altered their intention, and thus enabled themselves to  reserve their medal to Professor Mitscherlick for another year; at  which period, for aught they knew, his discoveries might possess the  additional merit of having been made prior to the limit allowed by their  regulations. That medal was, in fact, voted at a meeting, at which no  one member present was at all conversant with the subjects rewarded. I  shall, however, say no more on this subject. They erred from feeling,  an error so very rare with them, that it might be pardoned even for its  singularity.    I will, however, add one word to those whose censures have been unjustly  dealt, to those who have reproached the philosopher for receiving  pecuniary advantage from his inventions.    Amongst the many and varied contrivances for the demands of science,  or the arts of life, with which we were enriched by the genius of  Wollaston, was it too much to allow him to retain, during his fleeting  career, one out of the multitude, to furnish that: pecuniary supply,  without which, the man will want food for his body, and the philosopher  be destitute of tools for his inventions? Had he been, as, from the rank  he held in science, he certainly would have been in other kingdoms, rich  in the honours his country could bestow, and receiving from her a reward  in some measure commensurate with his deserts,--then, indeed, there  might have been reason for that reproach; but I am convinced that,  in such circumstances, the philosopher would have balanced, with no  \"niggard\" hand, the claims of his country, and would have given to it,  unreservedly, the produce of his powerful mind.          SECTION 9. OF THE FAIRCHILD LECTURE.    Mr. Fairchild left by will twenty-five pounds to the Royal Society. This  was increased by several subscriptions, and 100L. 3 per cent. South  Sea Annuities was purchased, the interest of which was to be devoted  annually to pay for a sermon to be preached at St.Leonard's, Shoreditch.    Few members of the Society, perhaps, are aware, either of the bequest or  of its annual payment. I shall merely observe, that for five years,  from 1800 to 1804, it was regularly given to Mr. Ascough; and that for  twenty-six years past, it has been as regularly given to the Rev. Mr.  Ellis.    The annual amount is too trifling to stimulate to any extraordinary  exertions; yet, small as it is, it might, if properly applied, be  productive of much advantage to religion, and of great honour to the  Society. For this purpose, it would be desirable that it should be  delivered at some church or chapel, more likely to be attended by  members of the Royal Society. Notice of it should be given at the place  of worship appointed, at least a week previous to its delivery, and at  the two preceding weekly meetings of the Royal Society. The name of the  gentleman nominated for that year, and the church at which the sermon is  to be preached, should be stated.    With this publicity attending it, and by a judicious selection of the  first two or three gentlemen appointed to deliver it, it would soon  be esteemed an honour to be invited to compose such a lecture, and the  Society might always find in its numerous list of members or aspirants,  persons well qualified to fulfil a task as beneficial for the promotion  of true religion, as it ever must be for the interest of science. I am  tempted to believe that such a course would call forth exertions of the  most valuable character, as well as give additional circulation to what  is already done on that subject.    The geological speculations which have been adduced, perhaps with too  much haste by some, as according with the Mosaic history, and by  others, as inconsistent with its truth, would, if this subject had been  attentively considered, have been allowed to remain until the fullest  and freest inquiry had irrevocably fixed their claim to the character  of indisputable facts. But, I will not press this subject further on  my reader's attention, lest he should think I am myself delivering the  lecture. All that I could have said on this point has been so much more  ably stated by one whose enlightened view of geological science has  taken away some difficulties from its cultivators, and, I hope, removed  a stumbling-block from many respectable individuals, that I should only  weaken by adding to the argument. [I allude to the critique of Dr. Ure's  Geology in the British Review, for July, 1829; an Essay, equally worthy  of a philosopher and a Christian.]          SECTION 10. OF THE CROONIAN LECTURE.    The payment [Three pounds.] for this Lecture, like that of the  preceding, is small. It was instituted by Dr. Croone, for an annual  essay on the subject of Muscular Motion. It is a little to be regretted,  that it should have been so restricted; and perhaps its founder, had he  foreseen the routine into which it has dwindled, might have endeavoured  to preserve it, by affording it a wider range.    By giving it to a variety of individuals, competition might have been  created, and many young anatomists have been induced to direct their  attention to the favourite inquiry of the founder of the Lecture;  but from causes which need not here be traced, this has not been the  custom--one individual has monopolized it year after year, and it seems,  like the Fairchild Lecture, rather to have been regarded as a pension.  There have, however, been some intervals; and we are still under  obligations to those who have supported THE SYSTEM, for not appointing  Sir Everard Home to read the Croonian Lecture twenty years in  SUCCESSION. Had it been otherwise, we might have heard of vested rights.          SECTION 11. OF THE CAUSES OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.    The best friends of the Royal Society have long admitted, whilst they  regretted, its declining fame; and even those who support whatever  exists, begin a little to doubt whether it might not possibly be  amended.    The great and leading cause of the present state to which the Royal  Society is reduced, may be traced to years of misrule to which it has  been submitted. In order to understand this, it will be necessary  to explain the nature of that misrule, and the means employed in  perpetuating it.    It is known, that by the statutes, the body of the Society have the  power of electing, annually, their President, Officers, and Council;  and it is also well known, that this is a merely nominal power, and  that printed lists are prepared and put into the hands of the members  on their entering the room, and thus passed into the balloting box. If  these lists were, as in other scientific societies, openly discussed in  the Council, and then offered by them as recommendations to the Society,  little inconvenience would arise; but the fact is, that they are private  nominations by the President, usually without notice, to the Council,  and all the supporters of the system which I am criticizing, endeavour  to uphold the right of this nomination in the President, and prevent or  discourage any alteration.    The Society has, for years, been managed by a PARTY, or COTERIE, or  by whatever other name may be most fit to designate a combination of  persons, united by no expressed compact or written regulations, but who  act together from a community of principles. That each individual has  invariably supported all the measures of the party, is by no means the  case; and whilst instances of opposition amongst them have been very  rare, a silent resignation to circumstances has been the most usual mode  of meeting measures they disapproved. The great object of this, as of  all other parties, has been to maintain itself in power, and to divide,  as far as it could, all the good things amongst its members. It has  usually consisted of persons of very moderate talent, who have had  the prudence, whenever they could, to associate with"]]]
