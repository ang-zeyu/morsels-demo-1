[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11758"],[0,"Baldy of Nome (#19)"],[1," He  plunged forward, and relentlessly \"Scotty\" followed. Hour after hour  the chase continued, until Fisher realized, at length, the futility of  it all; and thoroughly exhausted, crouched shivering in the snow,  waiting for the punishment that lay in the coils of the long black whip  in the man's hand.    When some little distance from him, Allan paused and called to Fisher.    The dog listened. There was something compelling in the tone, something  he could not resist; and so in spite of the temptation to make one more  wild dash for liberty, the dog crawled to \"Scotty's\" feet in fear and  trembling. And instead of the sting of the lash he had expected, a  kindly touch fell upon him, and a friendly voice said, \"It's a good  thing, old fellow, you decided to come to me of your own free will.    \"It means a bone instead of a beating--remember that always,\" and a  delicious greasy bone was taken from a capacious pocket and given him.    So Fisher went back to the stable with \"Scotty \"; where Jack McMillan  and other ex-rebels, but now loyal subjects, ignored, with a politeness  born of similar experiences, the little episode that taught Fisher once  for all that respect for authority eliminates the necessity for a  whipping. Which is, perhaps, the canine version of Virtue being its own  Reward.    The drive back to town was pleasant but uneventful. Ben, perfectly well  again, was eager to begin his school work and lay a foundation for the  wonderful education that Moose Jones had in mind for him, while Baldy  was glad to be at home once more where he could settle down to his  regular duties. It was with a contentment quite new to him, for in  \"Scotty\" Allan there was evident a growing recognition of his earnest  desire to be of real use. And with that certainty he ceased to worry  over the short-sightedness of a world which, till now, had appeared to  him unable to grasp the idea that while beauty is only fur deep, ability  goes to the bone.    Tom, Dick and Harry might attract the notice of strangers by their  persuasive ways; Jack McMillan compel admiration by his magnificence;  Irish and Rover win caresses by their affectionate demonstrations. But  after all, in storm and stress, with perhaps a life at stake, it was to  him, to Baldy the obscure, to Baldy \"formerly of Golconda, now of  Nome,\" that his master had turned in his hour of greatest need.    [Illustration:]          IX    With the Flight of Time    [Illustration:]          [Illustration]    CHAPTER IX    WITH THE FLIGHT OF TIME      The town of Nome, extending along the shore of Bering Sea for nearly two  miles, is not built back to any extent on the tundra, which stretches  away, a bog in summer, to the low-lying hills in the distance. In winter  this is, however, a wide sweep of spotless snow crossed by well-defined  trails--and it was here that the dogs were given their exercise.    There were many pleasant diversions in this daily training; visits to  the outlying camps, where they were lauded and petted by the miners, and  surreptitiously banqueted by the camp cooks.    Then there were impromptu races into town if by chance they encountered  other teams coming back after the day's work; when the leaders, eying  one another critically, even scornfully, would, without so much as a  bark by way of discussion, start headlong for Nome, which was visible in  the shadowy gray twilight only by its curling smoke and twinkling  lights.    On they would come, over the Bridge, and up the steep banks of Dry  Creek, turning into Front Street, and dashing down that main  thoroughfare at a pace that took little heed of city speed limits.    It was an hour when baby-sleds and small children were not in evidence;  and so they were always urged on to a spirited finish by the eager  voices of bystanders, to whom sport is more important than home and  dinner.    The unmarked days have slipped into the fast-flying weeks, and they into  the months; till, suddenly, as from a lethargy, the North arouses itself  to greet the first unfailing herald of spring--the Dog Races of Nome.  And about the second week in February the serious work that is the  forerunner of these spring races is begun; and Baldy found his time full  to overflowing with the duties that had long since become joys.    Many luxuries were added to their usual comforts, and all sorts of  improvements made in equipment. There were beautiful patent leather  collars stuffed with caribou hair and faced with rattan, so there should  be no chafing of the neck; they were as \"fine and becoming,\" the Woman  said, \"as feather boas.\" All extra weight was eliminated. The harness  was of thin linen webbing; snaps and buckles gave place to ivory  toggles; wooden whiffletrees were replaced by those made of aluminum,  and the tow-line, light and flexible, and of incredible strength, was of  walrus hide.    Most wonderful of all, it seemed to Ben, George and Dan, was the racing  sled, built on delicate lines, but of tough, almost unbreakable hickory,  and lashed with reindeer sinew. It weighed but little more than thirty  pounds--\"as trim a bark as ever sailed the uncharted trails,\" according  to Pete Bernard; and surely a sight to gladden the eyes of a Dog Musher  of the North.    To the front of this was attached a delicately adjusted combination of  scales and springs, by which Allan could tell when the draft of the team  equaled a pound to the dog; and if more was indicated he was always  behind pushing and adding all of the strength he possessed to that of  those steel-muscled animals each of whom can start, on runners, several  hundred pounds on level snow.    The Kennel was at all times delightful and spotless from its frequent  coats of whitewash. It was airy in summer, and protected in winter; and  the mangers used for beds and stuffed with clean, dry straw, were far  enough off the floor so that there could be no dampness. Electric lights  in the long dark months made it possible to keep the place easily in  perfect order; but with increased activity came increased conveniences  such as hooks in the stalls to hold each dog's harness, which was marked  with the wearer's name, and many other trouble-saving devices that would  prevent confusion when they were preparing for their frequent runs.    Of course the Allan and Darling dogs were all docked. That it was  correct, and gave them a trim appearance, would not have impressed Baldy  in the least; but that it kept their tails from freezing when going  through overflows in icy streams, which causes much personal agony, and  injury to the eyes of the dog in the rear, was a matter of signal  importance.    Always well-groomed, the care of the Kennel inmates now became the sole  task of Matt, who examined them thoroughly twice a day; cutting and  filing their nails when necessary, that they might not split, and  currying and brushing their hair till the Big Man observed that these  elaborate preparations suggested a beauty contest rather than a dog  race.    Ben Edwards was about constantly, when not in school, to assist Matt;  and under his unremitting attention Baldy was fast becoming, if not  handsome, at least far from unsightly.    Then, too, Ben would often help \"Scotty\" by taking Baldy and several of  the steady dogs out, to give the former as much experience in the wheel  as possible; for Baldy was being seriously considered as a permanent  wheeler in the Racing Team. His qualifications were not brilliant, but  he had proved in the Juvenile Race that he possessed the power to  enforce his authority on flighty and reckless dogs; and on the trip to  the Hot Springs that his courage was equal to his energy.    Many of the dogs had been in several of the Sweepstakes teams and they  realized that these short, snappy spins were for speed and not  endurance, which is the main feature of the great race.    Baldy watched with much anxiety the lack of intelligent interest on the  part of a few of the recruits, and tried to infuse the proper zest into  them by the force of a good example. That not proving entirely  satisfactory, he had been known, when really necessary, to use the  prerogative of a loose leader, and bite the dog in front of him when he  wished to suggest more readiness, or a closer attention to business. But  that was contrary to Baldy's peace policy, and was always a last resort.    The old guard were naturally the mentors, and it was a pleasure to watch  the skill with which they performed their tasks. It was a stupid or  unwilling dog indeed who could not learn much from the agile Tolmans, or  the gentle Irish Setters, in whom the fierce strong blood of some huskie  grandparent would never be suspected except for a certain toughness that  manifested itself in trail work alone.    As for Kid, capable from the first, he was fast developing a justifiable  confidence in himself, and a perfect control over the rest of the team,  and \"Scotty\" was jubilant over such a leader.    \"We have a good team,\" he said to the Woman as they stood watching the  dogs at play out in the corral with Ben, George and Dan. \"And we need  it. Matt tells me that Seward Peninsula has been scoured quietly, from  one end to the other, to add finer dogs to last year's seasoned entries.  And all of the drivers will be men who know the game.\" Which meant a  severe struggle; for strength and speed in the dogs, and real  generalship and a masterly comprehension of all phases of the trail, in  the driver, are the chief requisites in this wonderful contest.    \"They're in great form,\" observed the Woman with pride and admiration.  \"I don't think I have ever seen them looking better.\"    \"True,\" agreed \"Scotty.\" \"But don't count too much on that, for the year  we had that strange epidemic in the Kennel, something like distemper,  they seemed perfectly well till almost the day of the race. And that was  the race,\" grimly, \"when the dear little Fuzzy-wuzzy Lap Dogs, as you  call them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11772"],[0,"Narrative of a Voyage to Senegal in 1816 (#19)"],[1,"nt: among this number was an  unhappy gardener, and the wife of a soldier: this poor woman, exhausted  with fatigue, told her husband to abandon her, for, that it was impossible  for her to proceed; the soldier in despair, said to her in a rage: \"well,  since you cannot walk, to hinder you from being devoured alive by wild  beasts, or carried into captivity among the Moors, I will run you through  the body with my sabre;\" he did not execute this threat, which he had  probably conceived in a moment of despair; but the poor woman fell, and  died under the most cruel sufferings.    Some persons having strayed from the main body, were taken by the natives  of the country, and carried into the camp of the Moors; an officer remained  above a month with them, and was afterwards brought to the Isle of St.  Louis. The naturalist, Kummer, and Mr. Rogery, having separated from the  troops, were forced to wander from one horde to another, and were at last  conducted to Senegal. Their story, which we are now going to give, will  complete the narrative of the adventures of our shipwrecked companions who  traversed the desert.    After the stranding of the long-boat, Mr. Kummer quitted the caravan,  formed by the persons wrecked, and proceeded in an easterly direction, in  the hope of meeting with some Moors, who would give him food, to appease  the hunger and thirst which he had endured for two days. Shortly after his  departure, Mr. Rogery took the same resolution as our naturalist, and  followed a route parallel to that taken by Mr. Kummer. This latter walked  the whole day without meeting with any body; towards the evening he  perceived, at a distance, some fires on the heights which generally lie  round the ponds. This sight filled him with joy, and with hopes of meeting,  at length, with some Moors who would conduct him to the Isle of St. Louis,  and give him food of which he was much in need; he advanced with a firm and  rapid step, went up to the Moors, who were under their tents, with much  assurance, pronouncing as well as he could, a few words in Arabic, in which  language he had taken some lessons while in France, and which he  accompanied with profound salutations: \"Receive,\" said he, \"in your tents,  the son of an unfortunate Mahometan woman, whom I am going to join in Upper  Egypt; a shipwreck has thrown me on your coast, and I come in the name of  the great prophet, to ask you for hospitality and assistance.\" At the name  of the great prophet, Mr. Kummer bowed his face to the earth, and made the  customary salutation: the Moors did the same, and doubted not but that they  saw, before them, a follower of Mahomet.    They received him with joy, asked him to enter their tents, and to give a  short account of his adventures. Milk, and flour of millet, were given him,  and this food revived his strength. Then the Moors made him promise to  conduct them to the place where the long-boat had stranded; they hoped to  get possessions of the numerous effects, which they supposed the persons  shipwrecked to have abandoned on the shore. Having made this promise, Mr.  Kummer went to examine the tents, and the flocks of the chief of this tribe  who conducted him himself, and boasted of his wealth and his dignity: he  told him that he was the Prince Fune Fahdime Muhammed, son of Liralie  Zaide, King of the Moors, called Trazas, and that, when he returned from  the sea coast, he would take him to the King, his father, and that he would  see there, his numerous slaves, and his innumerable flocks. While they were  walking about the camp, Prince Muhammed perceived that Mr. Kummer had a  watch: he desired to see it; of course, he could not refuse to shew it; the  prince took it, and told Mr. Kummer that he would return it him when they  should arrive at Andar, which promise he punctually performed. They arrived  at last at the head of the flock, and our naturalist was astonished at the  extraordinary care which these people take of their beasts. The horses and  camels were in a separate place, and the whole flock was on the border of a  large salt pond; behind them, the slaves had formed a line of fires of  great extent, to drive away the mosquitoes and other insects, which torment  these animals: they were all remarkably beautiful. While traversing, with  the chief, the various quarters of the camp, Mr. Kummer beheld with  surprise, their manner of cleaning their beasts. Upon an order of the  Prince, the men, charged with this employment, take the strongest oxen by  the horns, and throw them down on the sand with astonishing ease; the  slaves then take the animal, and clear its whole body from the insects,  which, notwithstanding the fires that surround the flocks, get among the  hair of the cattle, which they torment cruelly. After this first operation,  they are washed with care, particularly the cows, which are then milked.  These various operations generally employ the slaves, and even the masters,  till eleven o'clock at night. Mr. Kummer was afterwards invited to repose  in the Prince's tent; but before, he could go to sleep, he was assailed  with a multitude of questions. The history of the French Revolution has  penetrated to these people; and they put questions to our naturalist which  surprised him much; they afterwards asked him why our vessels no longer  came to Portendick and the Isles of Arguin; after this, they allowed him to  take a few moments' repose; but the poor Toubabe, (the name which the Moors  give to the whites) did not dare to indulge himself in sleep; he feared the  perfidy of the Moors, and their rapacious spirit; however, exhausted by  three days incessant fatigue, he fell asleep for a few moments; he had but  a very disturbed slumber; during which, the barbarians took away his purse,  which still contained thirty pieces of 20 francs each, his cravat, pocket  handkerchief, great-coat, shoes, waistcoat, and some other things which he  carried in his pockets: he had nothing left but a bad pair of pantaloons  and a hunting jacket; his shoes were, however, returned to him.    The next morning, at sun-rise, the Moors made their salam, (a Mahometan  prayer): then about eight o'clock, the Prince, four of his subjects, Mr.  Kummer, and a slave, set out for the sea-coast, in order to look for the  wreck of the long-boat. They proceeded first towards the _South_, then to  the _West_, then to the _North_, which made Mr. Kummer imagine that they  were conducting him to Morocco. The Moors have no other method of finding  their way, than to go from one eminence to another, which obliges them to  take all sorts of directions; after they had proceeded five or six leagues  to the East, they again turned to the _West_, then to the _South West_.  After walking a considerable time longer, they arrived at the shore, where  they found but few things. What particularly attracted their attention, was  pieces of copper: they took them away, resolving to return and fetch the  fragments of the long-boat, and several barrel, which the currents had  driven on the coast. After taking whatever they could carry away, they set  out towards the _East_, and at the end of about two leagues, they met some  other Moors, also subjects of Prince Muhammed; they stopped and lay down  under their tents: the Prince lay down under the finest, and ordered  refreshments to be given to the _Toubabe_, who was worn out with fatigue  and want of nourishment. Here Mr. Kummer was tormented by the women and  children, who came every moment to touch and feel the fineness of his skin,  and to take away some fragments of his shirt, and the few things which he  had left. During the evening, fresh questions were put to him respecting  the cruel wars which desolated France; he was obliged to trace the account  of them, on the sand in Arabic letters. It was this extreme complaisance,  and his pretended quality of the son of a Christian and of a Mahometan  woman, which caused him to be upon very good terms with Prince Muhammed,  and in general, with all the Moors whom he met with, on his journey. Every  moment of the day, the Prince begged Mr. Kummer, to make the wheels of his  watch go, the motions of which, much astonished the Moors; our traveller  was on his side equally surprised, to see among the hordes, children five  or six years of age, who wrote Arabic perfectly well.    The next day, July 8, at day-break, the Moors went and stationed themselves  on the summit of a hill. There, prostrated with their faces turned towards  the East, they waited for the rising of the sun, to perform their salam,  which they begin the moment he appears in the horizon. Mr. Kummer followed  them, imitated them in all their ceremonies, and never failed in the  sequel, to perform his devotions at the same time as they did. The ceremony  being over, the prince and his suite, continued their route in the  direction of the _South East_, which again frightened the poor _Toubabe_;  he thought that the Moors were going to resume their course to the _North_,  and that in the end they would take him to Morocco; then he endeavoured to  impart his uneasiness to Prince Muhammed, who at last comprehended him; but  to make it quite clear, Mr. Kummer drew upon the sand, a part of the map of  Africa; mean time, he heard them continually pronounce the word _Andar_,  which did not at all diminish his alarms; but by the lines which he traced,  he soon understood that the Moors meant the Isle of St. Louis; of which he  was convinced when he had written the name of the European factory, by the  side of that of Andar. The Moors let him know that they had comprehended  him; and shewed great joy that a white could understand their language.    At noon, they stopped on the side of a great pond or lake. Mr. Kummer, who  was extremely fatigued, lay down on the sand, and fell asleep immediately.  During his sleep, the Moors went to look for a fruit, produced by a tree  which generally grows on the"]]]
