This Spartan rule applies                      To every one.                In theatres, as in life,                      Each has her line                This partthe Grand Duke's wife                      (Oh agony!) is mine!                A maxim new I do not start                The canons of dramatic art                Decree that this repulsive part                      (The Grand Duke's wife)                            Is mine!

Oh, listen to me, dear                      I love him only, darling!                            Remember, oh, my pet,                            On him my heart is set                This kindness do me, dear-                      Nor leave me lonely, darling!                            Be merciful, my pet,                            Our love do not forget!      JULIA.      Now don't be foolish, dear                      You couldn't play it, darling!                            It's \"leading business\", pet                            And you're but a soubrette.                So don't be mulish, dear-                      Although I say it, darling,                            It's not your line, my pet                            I play that part, you bet!                                  I play that part                            I play that part, you bet!      (LISA overwhelmed with grief.)      NOT.  The lady's right. Though Julia's engagement                            Was for the stage meant          It certainly frees Ludwig from his                            Connubial promise.          Though marriage contractsor whate'er you call 'em                            Are very solemn,          Dramatic contracts (which you all adore so)                            Are even more so!

Enter a procession of the members of the theatrical company (now          dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida), carrying          garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and          heralding the return of LUDWIG and JULIA from the marriage          ceremony, which has just taken place.      CHORUS.            As before you we defile,                      Eloia!  Eloia!          Pray you, gentles, do not smile          If we shout, in classic style,                      Eloia!

For as gaily we pass on          Probably we shall, anon,          Sing a Diergeticon                      Eloia! Eloia!                      Opoponax! Eloia!      RECIT.LUDWIG.            Your loyalty our Ducal heartstrings touches:          Allow me to present your new Grand Duchess.          Should she offend, you'll graciously excuse her          And kindly recollect I didn't choose her!                             SONGLUDWIG.      At the outset I may mention it's my sovereign intention          To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best,    For the company possesses all the necessary dresses          And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the    rest.    We've a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)          Who respond to the choreut of that cultivated age,    And our clever chorus-master, all but captious criticaster          Would accept as the choregus of the early Attic stage.    This return to classic ages is considered in their wages,          Which are always calculated by the day or by the week    And I'll pay 'em (if they'll back me) all in oboloi and drachm,          Which they'll get (if they prefer it) at the Kalends that                are Greek!      (Confidentially to audience.)          At this juncture I may mention                That this erudition sham          Is but classical pretension,                The result of steady \"cram.\":          Periphrastic methods spurning,          To this audience discerning          I admit this show of learning                Is the fruit of steady \"cram.\"!      CHORUS.     Periphrastic methods, etc.      In the period Socratic every dining-room was Attic          (Which suggests an architecture of a topsy-turvy kind),    There they'd satisfy their thirst on a recherche cold {Greek    word}          Which is what they called their lunchand so may you if                you're inclined.    As they gradually got on, they'd {four Greek words)          (Which is Attic for a steady and a conscientious drink).    But they mixed their wine with waterwhich I'm sure they didn't                oughter          And we modern Saxons know a trick worth two of that, I                think!    Then came rather risky dances (under certain circumstances)          Which would shock that worthy gentleman, the Licenser of                Plays,    Corybantian maniac kickDionysiac or Bacchic          And the Dithyrambic revels of those undecorous days.      (Confidentially to audience.)                And perhaps I'd better mention,                      Lest alarming you I am,                That it isn't our intention                      To perform a Dithyramb                It displays a lot of stocking,                Which is always very shocking,                And of course I'm only mocking                      At the prevalence of \"cram\"!      CHORUS.                 It displays a lot, etc.      Yes, on reconsideration, there are customs of that nation          Which are not in strict accordance with the habits of our                day,    And when I come to codify, their rules I mean to modify,          Or Mrs. Grundy, p'r'aps, may have a word or two to say.    For they hadn't macintoshes or umbrellas or goloshes          And a shower with their dresses must have played the very                deuce,    And it must have been unpleasing when they caught a fit of                sneezing,          For, it seems, of pocket-handkerchiefs they didn't know the                use.    They wore little underclothingscarcely anythingor nothing          And their dress of Coan silk was quite transparent in                design    Well, in fact, in summer weather, something like the \"altogether\"          And it's there, I rather fancy, I shall have to draw the                line!      (Confidentially to audience.)                And again I wish to mention                      That this erudition sham                Is but classical pretension,                      The result of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8102"],[0,"The Forme of Cury: A Roll of Ancient English Cookery Compiled, about A.D. 1390 (#18)"],[1,"[4] serve yt forthe.
