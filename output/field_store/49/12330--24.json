I shall therefore change the  suppositions. I shall say that I know with certainty that he is not to  put his hand into the fire and hold it there till it be consumed: And  this event, I think I can foretell with the same assurance, as that, if  he throw himself out at the window, and meet with no obstruction, he  will not remain a moment suspended in the air. No suspicion of an  unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the former event, which  is so contrary to all the known principles of human nature. A man who at  noon leaves his purse full of gold on the pavement at Charing-Cross, may  as well expect that it will fly away like a feather, as that he will  find it untouched an hour after. Above one half of human reasonings  contain inferences of a similar nature, attended with more or less  degrees of certainty proportioned to our experience of the usual conduct  of mankind in such particular situations.    71. I have frequently considered, what could possibly be the reason why  all mankind, though they have ever, without hesitation, acknowledged the  doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and reasoning, have yet  discovered such a reluctance to acknowledge it in words, and have rather  shown a propensity, in all ages, to profess the contrary opinion. The  matter, I think, may be accounted for after the following manner. If we  examine the operations of body, and the production of effects from their  causes, we shall find that all our faculties can never carry us farther  in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that particular  objects are _constantly conjoined_ together, and that the mind is  carried, by a _customary transition,_ from the appearance of one to the  belief of the other. But though this conclusion concerning human  ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject, men  still entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate  farther into the powers of nature, and perceive something like a  necessary connexion between the cause and the effect. When again they  turn their reflections towards the operations of their own minds, and  _feel_ no such connexion of the motive and the action; they are thence  apt to suppose, that there is a difference between the effects which  result from material force, and those which arise from thought and  intelligence. But being once convinced that we know nothing farther of  causation of any kind than merely the _constant conjunction_ of objects,  and the consequent _inference_ of the mind from one to another, and  finding that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have  place in voluntary actions; we may be more easily led to own the same  necessity common to all causes. And though this reasoning may contradict  the systems of many philosophers, in ascribing necessity to the  determinations of the will, we shall find, upon reflection, that they  dissent from it in words only, not in their real sentiment. Necessity,  according to the sense in which it is here taken, has never yet been  rejected, nor can ever, I think, be rejected by any philosopher. It may  only, perhaps, be pretended that the mind can perceive, in the  operations of matter, some farther connexion between the cause and  effect; and connexion that has not place in voluntary actions of  intelligent beings. Now whether it be so or not, can only appear upon  examination; and it is incumbent on these philosophers to make good  their assertion, by defining or describing that necessity, and pointing  it out to us in the operations of material causes.    72. It would seem, indeed, that men begin at the wrong end of this  question concerning liberty and necessity, when they enter upon it by  examining the faculties of the soul, the influence of the understanding,  and the operations of the will. Let them first discuss a more simple  question, namely, the operations of body and of brute unintelligent  matter; and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and  necessity, except that of a constant conjunction of objects, and  subsequent inference of the mind from one to another. If these  circumstances form, in reality, the whole of that necessity, which we  conceive in matter, and if these circumstances be also universally  acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind, the dispute is  at an end; at least, must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But  as long as we will rashly suppose, that we have some farther idea of  necessity and causation in the operations of external objects; at the  same time, that we can find nothing farther in the voluntary actions of  the mind; there is no possibility of bringing the question to any  determinate issue, while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition. The  only method of undeceiving us is to mount up higher; to examine the  narrow extent of science when applied to material causes; and to  convince ourselves that all we know of them is the constant conjunction  and inference above mentioned. We may, perhaps, find that it is with  difficulty we are induced to fix such narrow limits to human  understanding: But we can afterwards find no difficulty when we come to  apply this doctrine to the actions of the will. For as it is evident  that these have a regular conjunction with motives and circumstances and  characters, and as we always draw inferences from one to the other, we  must be obliged to acknowledge in words that necessity, which we have  already avowed, in every deliberation of our lives, and in every step of  our conduct and behaviour.[17]        [17] The prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted      for, from another cause, viz. a false sensation or seeming      experience which we have, or may have, of liberty or      indifference, in many of our actions. The necessity of any      action, whether of matter or of mind, is not, properly      speaking, a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or      intelligent being, who may consider the action; and it consists      chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the      existence of that action from some preceding objects; as      liberty, when opposed to necessity, is nothing but the want of      that determination, and a certain looseness or indifference,      which we feel, in passing, or not passing, from the idea of one      object to that of any succeeding one. Now we may observe,      that, though, in _reflecting_ on human actions, we seldom feel      such a looseness, or indifference, but are commonly able to      infer them with considerable certainty from their motives, and      from the dispositions of the agent; yet it frequently happens,      that, in _performing_ the actions themselves, we are sensible      of something like it: And as all resembling objects are readily      taken for each other, this has been employed as a demonstrative      and even intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel, that our      actions are subject to our will, on most occasions; and imagine      we feel, that the will itself is subject to nothing, because,      when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we feel, that it      moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself (or a      _Velleity,_ as it is called in the schools) even on that side,      on which it did not settle. This image, or faint motion, we      persuade ourselves, could, at that time, have been compleated      into the thing itself; because, should that be denied, we find,      upon a second trial, that, at present, it can. We consider not,      that the fantastical desire of shewing liberty, is here the      motive of our actions. And it seems certain, that, however we      may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves, a spectator can      commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and      even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might,      were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our      situation and temper, and the most secret springs of our      complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of      necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.    73. But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the  question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question of  metaphysics, the most contentious science; it will not require many  words to prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of  liberty as well as in that of necessity, and that the whole dispute, in  this respect also, has been hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by  liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot surely mean that  actions have so little connexion with motives, inclinations, and  circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of  uniformity from the other, and that one affords no inference by which we  can conclude the existence of the other. For these are plain and  acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean _a  power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the  will;_ that is, if we choose to remain at rest, we may; if we choose to  move, we also may. Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed  to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains. Here, then,  is no subject of dispute.    74. Whatever definition we may give of liberty, we should be careful to  observe two requisite circumstances; _first,_ that it be consistent with  plain matter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#18)"],[1,"rubber  covered bottles or tubes, to be inserted under the canisters or thwarts  of the life-boats in ocean-going vessels, and this can be done at a  simple interest on the first outlay, without any loss by depreciation,  as it will always be worth its cost, and be invaluable in case of need.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ACIDS OF WOOL OIL.      All wools contain a certain amount of animal oil or grease, which  permeates every portion of the fleece. The proportion of oil varies with  the breed of sheep. A difference in climate and soil materially affects  the yield of oil. This is shown by analyses made of different kinds of  wool, both foreign and domestic. Spanish wool was found to have but  eight per cent. grease; Australian wool fifteen per cent.; while in some  fleeces of Pennsylvania wool as high as forty per cent. was obtained. To  extract the oil from the wool, a fleece was put in a tall cylinder and  naphtha poured on it. The naphtha on being allowed to drain through  slowly dissolved out the grease. This naphtha solution was distilled;  the naphtha passing off while grease remained--a dark oil having high  specific gravity and remaining nearly solid at the ordinary temperature.  I am indebted to Mrs. Richards for this method of extracting the oil.  The process is quick and inexpensive, and is applicable to the treatment  of large quantities of wool.    The object of these experiments was to find the readiest method of  separating wool oil into its bases and acids, and further to identify  the various fatty acids. A solution of the oil in naphtha was cooled to  15 deg. C. This caused a separation of the oil into two portions: a white  solid fat and a fluid dark oil. The first on examination proved to be a  mixture of palmitic and stearic acids existing uncombined in the wool  oil. The original wool oil was saponified by boiling with alcoholic  potash.    The soap formed was separated into two portions by shaking with ether  and water. On standing, the solution separated into two layers, the  upper or murial solution containing the bases, the lower or aqueous  solution containing the acids. This method of separation is very slow.  In one case it worked very well, but as a rule appeared to be almost  impracticable. Benzol and naphtha were tried, instead of ether, but the  results were less satisfactory. On suggestion of Prof. Ordway, potassium  chloride was added to the soap solution partially separated by ether and  water. This caused an immediate and complete separation. By the use of  potassium chloride it was found possible to effect a separation with  benzol and water, also with naphtha and water.    Another means of separation was tried by precipitating the calcium  salts, from a solution of the potash soap. From the portion of the  calcium salts insoluble in alcohol, a fatty acid was obtained with a  melting point and composition almost identical with the melting point  and composition of palmitic acid. The aqueous portion of the separation  effected by water and ether was examined for the fatty acid. The lead  salts of the fatty acids were digested with ether, which dissolved out  the lead oleate. From this oleic acid was obtained. This was further  purified by forming the Boreum salt of oleic acid. The lead salts not  soluble in ether were decomposed by acid. The fatty acids set free were  saponified by carbonate of potassium. A fractional precipitation was  effected by adding lead acetate in successive portions; each portion  sufficient to precipitate one-fourth of all the acids present.    The acid obtained from the first fractionation had the melting point at  75 deg.-76 deg., indicating an acid either in carbon then stearic or palmitic  acids.    The acids obtained from the third fractionation had a melting point of  53 deg.-54 deg. C. This acid in composition and general properties was very  similar to that obtained by freezing the naphtha solution of the oil,  and is probably a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids. These acids,  being in combination with the bases of the oil, would be set free only  on saponifying the oil and subsequently decomposing with acid.    In conclusion, I should say that but a small proportion of the fatty  acids exist in the wool oil uncombined; that the proportion of oleic  acid is small, and can only be obtained in an oxidized condition; that  the main portion of the fatty acids is composed of stearic and palmitic  acids in nearly equal proportions; that the existence of a fatty acid,  containing a higher per cent. of carbon than those mentioned, is not  fully established.--_N.W. Shedd, M.I.T._           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW ABSORBENT FOR OXYGEN.      OTTO, BARON V.D. PFORDTEN.--The author makes use of a solution of  chromous chloride, which he prepares as follows:    He first heats chromic acid with concentrated hydrochloric acid, so  as to obtain a strong green solution of chromic chloride free from  chlorine. This is then reduced with zinc and hydrochloric acid. The blue  chromous chloride solution thus obtained is poured into a saturated  solution of sodium acetate in an atmosphere of carbonic acid. A  red precipitate of chromous acetate is formed, which is washed by  decantation in water containing carbonic acid. This salt is relatively  stable, and can be preserved for an indefinite time in a moist condition  in stoppered bottles filled with carbonic acid.    In this process the following precautions are to be observed:    Spongy flocks always separate from the zinc used in the reduction, which  float about in the acid liquid for a long time and give off minute gas  bubbles. If poured into the solution of sodium acetate, they would  contaminate the precipitate; and when dissolved in hydrochloric acid,  would occasion a slight escape of hydrogen. The solution of chromous  chloride must therefore be freed from the zinc by filtration in the  absence of air. For this purpose the reduction is carried on in a flask  fitted up like a washing bottle. The long tube is bent down outside the  flask, and is here provided with a small bulb tube containing glass wool  or asbestos. The hydrogen gas liberated during reduction is at first let  escape through this tube; afterward its outer end is closed, and it is  pressed down into the liquid. The hydrogen must now pass through the  shorter tube (the mouthpiece of the washing bottle), which has an India  rubber valve. When the reduction is complete, the blue liquid is driven  up in the long tube by introducing carbonic acid through the short tube,  so that it filters through the asbestos into the solution of sodium  acetate into which the reopened end of the long tube dips. When washing  out the red precipitate, at first a little acetic acid is added to  dissolve any basic zinc carbonate which has been deposited. In this  manner a chromous acetate is obtained perfectly free from zinc.    For the absorption of oxygen the compound just described is decomposed  with hydrochloric acid in the following simple washing apparatus: Upon  a shelf there are fixed side by side two ordinary preparation glasses,  closed with caoutchouc stoppers, each having three perforations. Each  two apertures receive the glass tubes used in gas washing bottles, while  the third holds a dropping funnel. It is filled with dilute hydrochloric  acid, and after the expulsion of the air by a current of gas, plentiful  quantities of chromous acetate are passed into the bottles. When the  current of gas has been passed in for some time, the hydrochloric acid  is let enter, which dissolves the chromous acetate, and thus, in the  absence of air, produces a solution of blue chromous chloride. It is  advisable to use an excess of chromous acetate or an insufficient  quantity of hydrochloric acid, so that there may be no free hydrochloric  acid in the liquid. To keep back any free acetic acid which might be  swept over by the current of gas, there is introduced after the washing  apparatus another washing bottle with sodium carbonate. Also solid  potassium carbonate may be used instead of calcium chloride for drying  the gas. If the two apertures of the washing apparatus are fitted with  small pinch cocks, it is ready for use, and merely requires to be  connected with the gas apparatus in action in order to free the gas  generated from oxygen. As but little chromous salt is decomposed by the  oxygen such a washing apparatus may serve for many experiments.           *       *       *       *       *          GAIFFE'S NEW MEDICAL GALVANOMETER.      In this apparatus, which contains but one needle, and has no directing  magnet, proportionability between the intensities and deflections is  obtained by means of a special form given the frame upon which the wire  is wound.    We give herewith a figure of the curve that Mr. Gaiffe has fixed upon  after numerous experiments. Upon examination it will be seen that the  needle approaches the current in measure as the directing action of  the earth increases; and experiment proves that the two actions  counterbalance each other, and render the deflections very sensibly  proportional to the intensities up to an angle of from 65 to 75 degrees.    [Illustration]    Another important fact has likewise been ascertained, and that is that,  under such circumstances, the magnetic intensity of the needle may  change without the indications ceasing to have the same exactness up to  65 degrees. As well known, Mr. Desains has demonstrated that this occurs  likewise in sinus or tangent galvanometers; but these have helices that  are very large in proportion to the needle. In medical galvanometers the  proportions are no longer the same, and the needle is always very near  the directing helix. If this latter is square, or even elliptical, it is  found that, beyond an angle of 15 degrees, there are differences of 4 or  5 degrees in the indications given with the same intensity "]]]
