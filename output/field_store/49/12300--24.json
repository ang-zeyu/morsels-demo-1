In some  cases evidently the jurors entered into such details of the live stock  maintained by the manor as to justify the indignant words of the Saxon  chronicler, that not \"an ox nor a cow nor a swine was left that was not  set down in his writing.\"    The object of all this is plain enough. It was an assessment of the  property of the kingdom for purposes of taxation. The king wished to find  out, as indeed we are told in what may be considered a copy or an  abstract of the original writ directing the commissioners as to their  inquiries, whether he could get more from the kingdom in taxes than he  was then getting. But the record of this inquest has served far different  purposes in later times. It is a storehouse of information on many sides  of history, personal, family, geographical, and especially economic. It  tells us much also of institutions, but less than we could wish, and less  than it would have told us if its purpose had been less narrowly  practical. Indeed, this limiting of the record to a single definite  purpose, which was the controlling interest in making it, renders the  information which it gives us upon all the subjects in which we are now  most interested fragmentary and extremely tantalizing, and forces us to  use it with great caution. It remains, however, even with this  qualification, a most interesting collection of facts, unique in all the  Middle Ages, and a monument to the practical genius of the monarch who  devised it.    On August 1 of the same year in which the survey was completed, in a  great assembly on Salisbury Plain, an oath of allegiance to the king was  taken by all the land-holding men of England, no matter of whom they  held. This has been represented as an act of new legislation of great  institutional importance, but the view cannot be maintained. It is  impossible to suppose that all land-owners were present or that such an  oath had not been generally taken before; and the Salisbury instance was  either a renewal of it such as was occasionally demanded by kings of this  age, or possibly an emphatic enforcement of the principle in cases where  it had been neglected or overlooked, now perhaps brought to light by the  survey.    Already in 1083 Queen Matilda had died, to the lasting and sincere grief  of her husband; and now William's life was about to end in events which  were a fitting close to his stormy career. Border warfare along the  French boundary was no unusual thing, but something about a raid of the  garrison of Mantes, into Normandy, early in 1087, roused William's  especial anger. He determined that plundering in that quarter should  stop, and reviving old claims which had long been dormant he demanded the  restoration to Normandy of the whole French Vexin, of which Mantes was  the capital city. Philip treated his claims with contempt, and added a  coarse jest on William's corpulence which roused his anger, as personal  insults always did, to a white heat. The land around Mantes was cruelly  laid waste by his orders, and by a sudden advance the city was carried  and burnt down, churches and houses together. The heat and exertion of  the attack, together with an injury which he received while riding  through the streets of the city, by being thrown violently against the  pummel of his saddle by the stumbling of his horse, proved too much for  William in his physical condition, and he was carried back to Rouen to  die after a few weeks.    A monastic chronicler of a little later date, Orderic Vitalis, gives us a  detailed account of his death-bed repentance, but it was manifestly  written rather for the edification of the believer than to record  historical fact. It is interesting to note, however, that while William  is made to express the deepest sorrow for the numerous acts of wrong  which were committed in the process of the Conquest of England, there is  no word which indicates any repentance for the Conquest itself or belief  on William's part that he held England unjustly. He admits that it did  not come to him from his fathers, but the same sentence which contains  this admission affirms that he had gained it by the favour of God. It has  been strongly argued from these words, and from others like them, which  are put into the mouth of William later in this dying confession, when he  comes to dispose of his realms and treasures, that William was conscious  to himself that he did not possess any right to the kingdom of England  which he could pass on hereditarily to his heirs. These words might  without violence be made to yield this meaning, and yet it is impossible  to interpret them in this way on any sound principle of criticism,  certainly not as the foundation of any constitutional doctrine. There is  not a particle of support for this interpretation from any other source;  everything else shows that his son William succeeded him in England by  the same right and in the same way that Robert did in Normandy. William  speaks of himself in early charters, as holding England by hereditary  right. He might be ready to acknowledge that it had not come to him by  such right, but never that once having gained it he held it for himself  and his family by any less right than this. The words assigned to William  on his death-bed should certainly be interpreted by the words of the same  chronicler, after he has finished the confession; and these indicate some  doubt on William's part as to the effect of his death on the stability of  his conquest in England, and his great desire to hasten his son William  off to England with directions to Lanfranc as to his coronation before  the news of his own death should be spread abroad. They imply that he is  not sure who may actually become king in the tumults which may arise when  it becomes known that his own strong rule is ended; that rests with God:  but they express no doubt of the right of his heirs, nor of his own right  to determine which one among them shall succeed him.    With reluctance, knowing his disposition, William conceded Normandy to  Robert. The first-born son was coming to have special rights. More  important in this case was the fact that Robert's right to Normandy had  been formally recognized years before, and that recognition had never  been withdrawn. The barons of the duchy had sworn fealty to him as his  father's successor, and there was no time to put another heir in his  place, or to deal with the opposition that would surely result from the  attempt. William was his father's choice for England, and he was  despatched in all haste to secure the crown with the aid of Lanfranc. To  Henry was given only a sum of money, joined with a prophecy that he  should eventually have all that the king had had, a prophecy which was  certainly easy after the event, when it was written down, and which may  not have been difficult to a father who had studied carefully the  character of his sons. William was buried in the church of St. Stephen,  which he had founded in Caen, and the manner in which such foundations  were frequently made in those days was illustrated by the claim, loudly  advanced in the midst of the funeral service, that the land on which the  participants stood had been unjustly taken from its owners for the  Conqueror's church. It was now legally purchased for William's burial  place. The son, who was at the moment busy securing his kingdom in  England, afterwards erected in it a magnificent tomb to the memory of his  father.

CHAPTER IV      FEUDALISM AND A STRONG KING    William, the second son of the Conqueror, followed with no filial  compunction his father's command that he should leave his death-bed and  cross the channel at once to secure the kingdom of England. At the port  of embarkation he learned that his father had died, but he did not turn  back. Probably the news only hastened his journey, if this were possible.  In England he went first to Winchester to get possession of his father's  great treasure, and then to Canterbury with his letter to Lanfranc.  Nowhere is there any sign of opposition to his succession, or of any  movement in favour of Robert, or on Robert's part, at this moment. If the  archbishop had any doubts, as a man of his good judgment might well have  had, knowing the new king from his boyhood, they were soon quieted or he  resolved to put them aside. He had, indeed, no alternative. There is  nothing to indicate that the letter of his dying master allowed him any  choice, nor was there any possible candidate who gave promise of a better  reign, for Lanfranc must have known Robert as well as he knew William.  Together they went up to London, and on September 26, 1087, hardly more  than two weeks after he left his father's bedside, William was crowned  king by Lanfranc. The archbishop took of him the customary oath to rule  justly and to defend the peace and liberty of the Church, exacting a  special promise always to be guided by his advice; but there is no  evidence of any unusual assembly in London of magnates or people, of any  negotiations to gain the support of persons of influence, or of any  consent asked or given. The proceedings throughout were what we should  expect in a kingdom held by hereditary right, as the chancery of the  Conqueror often termed it, and by such a right descending to the heir.  This appearance may possibly have been given to these events by haste and  by the necessity of forestalling any opposition. Men may have found  themselves with a new king crowned and consecrated as soon as they  learned of the death of the old one; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#18)"],[1,"in  regard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be  new and interesting, we will undertake a brief description. The factory  is located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power. A  portion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,  the slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the  evaporating department. Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,  and with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large  bins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which  the apples are delivered from the teams. The floor in each of these has  a sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a  grate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough  half submerged in the pond.    The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds  as follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,  considerable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a  distance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the  basement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular  fall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit  the escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are  thoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter. Such is the  friction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing  of the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed  sections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away  with other impurities. From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an  endless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with  iron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story  of the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater. The press  is wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,  being actuated by the water power. The cheese is built up with layers  inclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden  time, and serves also to strain the cider. As it is expressed from  the press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the  defecator.    This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet  wide. At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in  diameter and closed at both ends. Lying between and connecting  these two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,  penetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and  under surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2  inches apart. When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as  manifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the  pan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch  underneath their outer surfaces.    The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about  three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Steam is introduced to the large  or manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at  a pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch. Trap valves  are provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the  pipes. The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities  and perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it. All portions of  pomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,  expand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider. An  ingeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it  over the side of the pan. To facilitate this removal, one side of the  pan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is  curved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined  plane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a  trough and carried away. A secondary purpose served by the defecator  is that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the  specific gravity of about 20 deg. Baume. When of this consistency the liquid  is drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a  siphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the  same framework and just below the defecator.    The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each  twelve feet long and three inches in diameter. These are each jacketed  or inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted  with steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space  surrounding the copper tubes. The latter are open at both ends  permitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the  steam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame  so as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of  the current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular  succession. Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam  gauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other  pipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity. Steam being  let on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of  sirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes  any impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;  passing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel  connected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the  whole system. The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from  20 deg. to 23 deg. Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes  later at a consistency of from 30 deg. to 32 deg. Baume, which is found on  cooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly. This point is found to  vary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon  bruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in  expressing the juice from the cheese. The least fermentation occasions  the necessity for a lower reduction. To guard against this, no cheese  is allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no  cider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large  water tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by  means of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,  trough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and  cleansed. Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the  defecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and  purified. If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,  the matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the  evaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe. If boiled cider  instead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn  off from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency  desired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing  the steam pressure.    As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub  holding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little  variations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit  used are equalized. From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,  into the various packages in which it is shipped to market. A favorite  form of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden  bucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds  respectively. The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience  in handling. The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to  1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours. It is calculated that  improvements now in progress will increase this to something more than a  ton per day. Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds  of jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than  earlier varieties. Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,  natural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all  varieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general  quality.    As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground  under a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a  succession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing. Here it  is occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of  the trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds  becoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp  floats away upon the stream. A succession of troughs serves to remove  nearly all the seeds. The value of the apple seeds thus saved is  sufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole  establishment. The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half  cubic feet being accounted a bushel.    This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,  who buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the  accounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one  sawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs  into short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds  the apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the  defecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman  and engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general  helper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever  needed. The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,  and manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides  considerable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled  cider.    The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was  six to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents. The proprietor  hopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels."]]]
