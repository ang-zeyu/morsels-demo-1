'The only thing we can do here, it seems, is to  try to frighten our little sisters.'    'He didn't, really, and I'm not so VERY little,' said Jane, rather  ungratefully.    Robert was silent. It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they had  better take the money and go.    'That wouldn't be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn't be  good, whatever way you look at it,' said Anthea, 'to take money that's  not ours.'    'We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged,'  said Cyril.    'That wouldn't make it right to steal,' said Anthea, stoutly.    'I don't know,' said Cyril. They were all standing up now. 'Stealing is  taking things that belong to some one else, and there's no one else.'    'It can't be stealing if--'    'That's right,' said Robert, with ironical approval; 'stand here all day  arguing while the candles burn out. You'll like it awfully when it's all  dark again--and bony.'    'Let's get out, then,' said Anthea. 'We can argue as we go.' So they  rolled up the carpet and went. But when they had crept along to the  place where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way  blocked by a great stone, which they could not move.    'There!' said Robert. 'I hope you're satisfied!'    'Everything has two ends,' said the Phoenix, softly; 'even a quarrel or  a secret passage.'    So they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first with  one of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to talk about  bones. And Cyril carried the carpet.    'I wish you hadn't put bones into our heads,' said Jane, as they went  along.    'I didn't; you always had them. More bones than brains,' said Robert.    The passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings and  dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing. The passage ended  in a flight of steps. Robert went up them.    Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane, and  everybody screamed, 'Oh! what is it?'    'I've only bashed my head in,' said Robert, when he had groaned for some  time; 'that's all. Don't mention it; I like it. The stairs just go right  slap into the ceiling, and it's a stone ceiling. You can't do good and  kind actions underneath a paving-stone.'    'Stairs aren't made to lead just to paving-stones as a general rule,'  said the Phoenix. 'Put your shoulder to the wheel.'    'There isn't any wheel,' said the injured Robert, still rubbing his  head.    But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already shoving  his hardest against the stone above. Of course, it did not give in the  least.    'If it's a trap-door--' said Cyril. And he stopped shoving and began to  feel about with his hands.    'Yes, there is a bolt. I can't move it.'    By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his father's  bicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs, and he lay  on his back, with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down  among his young relations, and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust  and oil fell down on his face. One even went into his mouth--open, as he  panted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position. Then  he tried again, but still the bolt would not move. So now he tied his  handkerchief--the one with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it--to the  bolt, and Robert's handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannot  come undone however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighter  the more you pull it. This must not be confused with a granny knot,  which comes undone if you look at it. And then he and Robert pulled,  and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too, and  suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch, and they all rolled  together to the bottom of the stairs--all but the Phoenix, which had  taken to its wings when the pulling began.    Nobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their fall; and  now, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose, for  the stone allowed them to heave it up. They felt it give; dust fell  freely on them.    'Now, then,' cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper, 'push all  together. One, two, three!'    The stone was heaved up. It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, and  showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it fell back with a  bang against something that kept it upright. Every one climbed out,  but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the  little paved house where they found themselves, so when the Phoenix had  fluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down, and it closed  like a trap-door, as indeed it was.    You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. Fortunately  there was no one to see them but each other. The place they were in  was a little shrine, built on the side of a road that went winding up  through yellow-green fields to the topless tower. Below them were fields  and orchards, all bare boughs and brown furrows, and little houses and  gardens. The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front wall--just a  place for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good. So the Phoenix  told them. There was an image that had once been brightly coloured, but  the rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine,  and the poor image was dull and weather-stained. Under it was written:  'St Jean de Luz. Priez pour nous.' It was a sad little place, very  neglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that poor  travellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry and worry  of their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and think about  being good. The thought of St Jean de Luz--who had, no doubt, in his  time, been very good and kind--made Anthea want more than ever to do  something kind and good.    'Tell us,' she said to the Phoenix, 'what is the good and kind action  the carpet brought us here to do?'    'I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tell  them about it,' said Cyril.    'And give it them ALL?' said Jane.    'Yes. But whose is it?'    'I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of the  castle,' said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one.    They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. A  little way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of the hillside and  falling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hart's-tongue  ferns, now hardly green at all. Here the children washed their hands  and faces and dried them on their pocket-handkerchiefs, which always,  on these occasions, seem unnaturally small. Cyril's and Robert's  handkerchiefs, indeed, rather undid the effects of the wash. But in  spite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before.    The first house they came to was a little white house with green  shutters and a slate roof. It stood in a prim little garden, and down  each side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to grow  in; but all the flowers were dead now.    Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of poles  and trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it. It was wider than our  English verandas, and Anthea thought it must look lovely when the  green leaves and the grapes were there; but now there were only dry,  reddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few withered leaves caught in  them.    The children walked up to the front door. It was green and narrow. A  chain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite openly to a  rusty bell that hung under the porch. Cyril had pulled the bell and  its noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all.  Cyril spoke it.    'My hat!' he breathed. 'We don't know any French!'    At this moment the door opened. A very tall, lean lady, with pale  ringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before them. She  had an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron. Her eyes were small  and grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as though she had been  crying.    She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign  language, and ended with something which they were sure was a question.  Of course, no one could answer it.    'What does she say?' Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of his  jacket, where the Phoenix was nestling. But before the Phoenix could  answer, the whitey-brown lady's face was lighted up by a most charming  smile.    'You--you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!' she cried. 'I love so much  the England. Mais entrez--entrez donc tous! Enter, then--enter all. One  essuyes his feet on the carpet.' She pointed to the mat.    'We only wanted to ask--'    'I shall say you all that what you wish,' said the lady. 'Enter only!'    So they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and putting  the carpet in a safe corner of the veranda.    'The most beautiful days of my life,' said the lady, as she shut the  door, 'did pass themselves in England. And since long time I have not  heard an English voice to repeal me the past.'    This warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for the  floor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, and  the floor of the sitting-room so very shiny--like a black  looking-glass--that each felt as though he had on far more boots than  usual, and far noisier.    There was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the hearth--neat  little logs laid on brass fire-dogs. Some portraits of powdered ladies  and gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls. There were silver  candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and there were chairs and a table, very  slim and polite, with slender legs. The room was extremely bare, but  with a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way of  its own. At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#18)"],[1,"who had  formerly performed, during the time of his appointment, some political  service in the Somali country, with great credit both to his mission  and himself. In consequence of this he was nicknamed El Balyuz, or the  Ambassador.    Balyuz was a clever Hindostani scholar, and, as I ultimately found,  possessed such honesty of purpose and straightforwardness of  character, as rendered him a perfect _rara avis_ amongst all Somali.  He was of the Mijjertaine tribe. Travelling in his company, after my  experiences with Sumunter and Ahmed, was verily a luxury. I parted  with him at the termination of the expedition with pure feelings of  affection.    Lieutenant Burton now conceived the idea of suppressing the system of  Abbanship, thinking that, as the Somali had access to Aden without any  impost, Englishmen ought to enjoy a corresponding freedom to travel in  Somali Land. This perhaps was scarcely the right time to dictate a  policy which would be distasteful as well as injurious (in a monetary  sense) to the people among whom we were about to travel, and with whom  it was highly essential to our interest to be on the most friendly  terms.[26]    I now applied to the Government for some Somali policemen, but  unfortunately there were then too few hands present to carry on the  duties of the office, and I could not have them. I therefore engaged,  by the orders of Lieutenant Burton, a dozen men of various races  (Egyptians, Nubians, Arabs, and Seedis), to form an escort, and armed  them with my sabres and muskets. They were all raw recruits, and  unaccustomed to warfare. Still we could get no others. With a little  practice they learned to shoot at a mark with tolerable accuracy.    Seven of these men, together with the eight camels I brought across  from Bunder Gori, were despatched direct to Berbera, whilst the  remaining five, and some ponies I purchased in Aden, remained with me.  I then took a bag of dollars for purchasing camels; some dates and  rice for the consumption of the party; and with the Balyuz and the old  servants, Imam the butler and Farhan the gamekeeper, all was ready for  my second adventure on the 20th March 1855.

Even  before we could sail out of the harbour, the first row commenced. The  Nakhoda (captain), as is often the case in these primitive countries,  kept no regular sailors, but trusted to finding men desirous of going  to their country, who would work his vessel for him--all Somali being  by nature sailors.    The men he had now on board were of the Habr Gerhajis and Habr Teljala  tribes, who occupy the coast-line near Kurrum, and had waited the  opportunity of obtaining a passage over there in company with me. They  were all dreadfully uproarious, and would not by any persuasion on my  part keep quiet. On inquiring from the Balyuz the cause of their  violent discussions, he informed me they were drawing lots to see who  should be my Abban, and those of the seven foreign servants I had with  me. The bare idea of eight Abbans was too ridiculous, and their  persistency made it beyond a joke. I instantly ordered the sails to be  hauled down, and had my instructions from Lieutenant Burton about  Abbans proclaimed to the whole crew: that the Balyuz was my Ras  Cafila, and the other foreigners my protectors. The Somali were  evidently determined not to be done. If I had been allowed to have but  one Abban with me, this could not have occurred. As it was, I said if  they determined on wrangling any more, I should 'bout ship and settle  the difference with them in a less ceremonious manner in the harbour.  This effectually stopped their tongues, and we again proceeded on the  journey. After two entire days' sailing across the Gulf with variable  and gentle breezes, we arrived at our destination, Kurrum, in safety,  on the third evening, the 24th March, and at once sent some Government  letters to the Akils, ordering their attendance, and to proclaim  publicly the nature of my business, in order that camels might be  brought for sale. I found all the people extremely obliging; they  tried to make my residence as comfortable as they could; showed me  great deference because I was an Englishman, and brought their camels  readily, though, of course, as might be expected, they were canny in  their mode of dealing, trying to dispose of their worst animals first,  and asking prices much above the market tariff. For poor animals they  asked from four to five and a half dollars, which, though not a third  of the price I paid in the Warsingali country, was full price for the  finest animals at Berbera. Berbera during the fair time is undoubtedly  the cheapest place to purchase camels in of all the coast-line, and  the farther you leave it the more expensive animals become, increasing  in price at the same ratio as the extent of distance. Whilst halting  here I heard of the existence of the Victoria N'yanza. The Somali  described its dimensions as equal in extent to the Gulf of Aden, and  further alluded to its being navigated by white men. None of the men  present had been there to see it, though it was currently known as a  positive fact amongst them. I did not believe the story in the light  they expressed it, supposing they confounded an inland sea with the  Western or Atlantic Ocean. Colonel Rigby, H.B.M. Consul at Zanzibar,  tells me he also heard of this lake when he was travelling in this  country some years previously. It is strange this story was never  published earlier. The white navigators alluded to are evidently the  expeditionists who were sent by Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, up the  White Nile as far as Gondokoro, about twelve or fourteen years ago,  and the Nile and lake have been confounded as one water in the  transmission of the intelligence, though both were seen.    The minds of the Kurrum people seemed greatly discomposed about  various rumours which they heard. One was that the English intended to  suppress the slave-trade, and they wished me to tell them if such was  not a fact--saying it would be unjust for us to do so, as slaving was  an acknowledged right given them in the Koran, and handed down by  their Russool Mahamed.    The other bugbear which alarmed them was a report that the English  intended either to take possession of Berbera, or that they would give  it to Shermarky--a native chief and ally of ours who lives at Zeylah.  In short, these numerous fears arose from Herne's long residence at  Berbera. It looked suspicious seeing him take notes there of  everything, and they naturally put the worst interpretation on all his  actions. What could be the use of his watching the trade, if our  Government did not want to take the country?--of watching the  slave-trade, if it did not mean stopping it? And then the suppression  of Abbanships was the crowning of all.    The village of Kurrum consisted of a single fort and a large  collection of mat huts, all grouped together, situated close to the  shore. The maritime plain consisted of sandy-brown soil, very  uninteresting, with scarcely any vegetation growing on it, and was  here only about half a mile broad. The hills in the background were  very insignificant, not half so high as any I had seen, and were dull  and brown, like those one sees when travelling down the Red Sea. The  people say that in their recesses and ravines acacias and other  gum-trees grow as they do elsewhere. Gum only exudes in the dry hot  season; and the confined air in the ravines is described as being so  hot that people can hardly stay there, and many of the gum-pickers who  do, become deaf in consequence of it.    The water which the villagers used was so brackish as to be hardly  drinkable. I lived here five days, enjoying sour camel's milk,  gossiping with the natives, and roaming about the place. The  difference between the life I was now living, attributable principally  to the sagacity and good-heartedness of the Balyuz, was a charming  contrast to my wretched existence when with the Warsingali. I bought  twenty-five camels, at an average rate of five and a half dollars  a-head, and then stopped purchasing, as I heard by letter from Herne  he had then got nearly sufficient for our requirements--that camels  were very plentiful at Berbera, and he was buying them at a cheaper  rate than I could.    On the 29th March, at 4 P.M., I broke ground with all my camels and  ponies, and commenced the march on Berbera. At sundown, after  travelling three miles along the sea-shore, we encamped in a  water-course called Goldéra. The water we found here, in a little well  in its bed, was deliciously sweet--so pleasant after the brackish  Kurrum wells. No one who had not been deprived for a long time of the  pure element, can conceive the greed with which a man first plunges  his head into clear sweet water. It is the natural fluid for man, and  for no other beverage does abstinence produce so keen an appetite.    The following morning, a little after daybreak, the caravan was ready,  and we soon got under way. Travelling with tedious slowness,  aggravated by the dreary monotony of the road and the sandy plain,  constantly crossing dry, shallow watercourses, lined on both sides by  fringes of stunted acacias or other salsolacious plants, we at last  arrived at a hot spring of sweet water, called Golamiro, and rested  here for several hours during the great heat of the mid-day sun. When  the day became cooler we resumed the march, and travelled until after  dark to a grazing-ground one mile short of Ain Tarad, and"]]]
