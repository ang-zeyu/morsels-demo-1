Is not this as childish as the childishness of the  savage, and barbarians, in their Mumbo-Jumbo conceptions? Let us leave  this phase of the subject.    The Higher Yogi Teachings hold to no such ideas or theories. It holds  that the Answer to the Secret is vested in the Infinite alone, and that  finite \"guesses\" regarding the \"Why\" are futile and pitiful. It holds  that while one should use the Reason to the full, still there are  phases of Being that can be considered only in Love, Faith, and  Confidence in THAT from which All Things flow, and in which we live and  move and have our being. It recognizes that the things of the Spirit,  are known by the Mind. It explores the regions of the Universal Mind to  its utmost limits, fearlessly--but it pauses before the Closed Door of  The Spirit, reverently and lovingly.    But, remember this--that while the Higher Yogi Teachings contain no  \"guess,\" or speculative theory, regarding the \"Why\" of the Divine  Manifestation, still they do not deny the existence of a \"Why\". In  fact, they expressly hold that the Absolute Manifestation of the Many  is in pursuance of some wondrous Divine Plan, and that the Unfoldment  of the Plan proceeds along well-established and orderly lines, and  according to Law. They trust in the Wisdom and Love of the Absolute  Being, and manifest a perfect Confidence, Trust and Peaceful Patience  in the Ultimate Justice, and Final Victory of the Divine Plan. No doubt  disturbs this idea--it pays no attention to the apparent contradictions  in the finite phenomenal world, but sees that all things are proceeding  toward some far-away goal, and that \"All is Well with the Universe\".    But they do not think for a moment, or teach in the slightest degree,  that all this Unfoldment, and Plan of the Universe, has for its object  any advantage, benefit or gain to the Absolute--such a thought would be  _folly_, for the Absolute is already Perfect, and Its Perfection cannot  be added to, or taken away from. But they do positively teach that  there is a great beneficial purpose in all the Plan, accruing in the  end to the developed souls that have evolved through the workings of  the plan. These souls do not possess the qualities of the  Infinite--they are Finite, and thus are capable of receiving benefits;  of growing, developing, unfolding, attaining. And, therefore, the Yogis  teach that this building up of Great Souls seems to be the idea of the  Infinite, so far as may be gained from an observation of the Workings  of the Plan. The Absolute cannot _need these_ Great Souls for Its own  pleasure, and therefore their building-up must be for their own  advantage, happiness and benefit.    The Yogis teach, on this subject, that there can be only ONE Real  Perfect Being--Perfect without experience--Perfect from the  Beginning--but only ONE! In other words, they teach that there can be  no such thing as Absolute Perfection, outside of the Absolute  Itself--and that not even the Absolute Being can create another  Absolute Being, for in that case there would be no Absolute Being at  all, but only _two Relative Beings_.    Think over this for a moment, and you will see its truth. The ABSOLUTE  must always be \"the One without a Second\", as the Yogis express  it--there cannot be _two_ Perfect ones. And so, all Finite Beings,  being Finite, must work their way up toward the plane of Perfection by  The Path of Life, with all of its lessons, tasks, cares, pains, and  strivings. This is the only way open to them--and even the Absolute  cannot have it otherwise, and still be the Absolute. There is a fine  point here--the Absolute is All-Powerful, but even that All-Power is  not sufficient to enable It to destroy Its Absolute Being. And so, you  who have wondered, perhaps you may now understand our words in the  First Lesson of this series, in which we said that the message of the  Absolute to some of the Illumined has been: \"All is being done in the  best and only possible way--I am doing the best I can--all is well--and  in the end will so appear.\"    And, as we also said in that First Lesson: \"The Absolute, instead of  being an indifferent and unmoved spectator to its own creation, is a  striving, longing, active, suffering, rejoicing, feeling Spirit,  partaking of the feelings of Its manifestations, rather than callously  witnessing them. It lives in us--with us--through us. Back of all the  pain in the world, may be found a great feeling and suffering love.\"  And in this thought there is comfort to the doubting soul--peace to the  troubled mind.    In the Sixth Lesson, we shall proceed to deliver to you the further  Message of Truth, concerning \"how\" the One Absolute manifests Its  Mental Images as Universe; Universal Life; and Forms and Shapes; and  Individualities, and Personalities. We had hoped to include the whole  Message in this Fifth Lesson, but now find that we have merely laid the  steps by which the student may reach the Essential Truth.    But, lest the student may be left in an uncertain state of mind,  awaiting the conclusion of the consideration of the subject--and lest  he may think that we intend teaching him that the Universe, and all in  it, including himself are \"Dreams,\" because we have said that All  Things are Thought-Forms in the Mind of the Absolute--lest this  misunderstanding may arise, we wish to add a few parting words to what  we have said.    We wish to impress upon the mind of the student that though all Things  are but Thought-Forms in the Mind of the Absolute Being, and that while  it is true that the entire Universe of Universes is simply a  Thought-Form held in the Mind of the Absolute--still this fact does not  mean that all Things are \"illusions\" or \"dreams.\" Remember this, now  and forever, O Student--that that which is held in the Absolute Mind as  a Thought-Form IS, and is all there IS, outside of the Absolute Itself.  When the Absolute forms a Thought-Form, It forms it out of Its own  mental substance--when the Absolute \"holds anything in Its Mind,\" It  holds it in Itself--for the Absolute is ALL-MIND.    The Absolute is not a material Being, from which Material Beings are  created. It is a Spiritual Being--a Being whose Substance is akin to  that which we call \"Mind,\" only raised to Infinity and Absolute  Perfection and Power. And this is the only way it can \"create\"--by  creating a Thought-Form in Its Mental, or Spiritual Substance. The  faintest \"Thought\" of the Absolute is more real and durable than  anything that man can create--in fact, man can \"create\" nothing, for  all the hard and real material he uses in his \"creations,\" such as  steel, diamonds, granite, are but some of the minor Forms, \"thought\"  into being by the Absolute.    And also remember this, that the Absolute cannot \"think\" of anything,  without putting Itself in that thing, as its Essence. Just as a man's  Mental Images are not only _in_ his mind, _but his mind is in them,  also_.    Why, you doubting and timorous ones, does not even the finite  \"thinking\" of Man manifest itself in physical and material changes of  form and shape?--does not a man's every thought actually \"create\"  physical forms and shapes, in his brain-cells and physical tissue? You  who are reading these words--yea, _while_ you are reading these  words--are \"creating\" changes of form and shape in your brain-cells,  and physical organism. Your mind is constantly at work, also, in  building up your physical body, along the lines of the Instinctive Mind  (see previous series of lessons)--you are mentally creating in a  miniature universe, every moment of your life. And yet, the idea of the  Absolute \"creating\" a Universe by pure Thought, in Its own Mind, and  thereafter causing the work of the Universe to proceed according to  Law, by simply \"Willing\" it so, causes you to wonder, and perhaps to  doubt.    O, ye of little faith, you would deny to the Absolute even the power  you possess yourself. You plan things in your mind every day, and then  proceed to cause them to appear in material manifestation, and yet you  doubt the ability of the Absolute to do likewise. Why even the poets,  or writers of fiction, create characters in their minds--and these seem  so real, that even you imagine them to be actual entities, and you weep  over their pains, and smile at their joys--and yet all this is on the  finite plane. Why, even the \"imaginations\" of your petty finite,  undeveloped minds, have sufficient power to make your physical bodies  sick, or well, or even to cause you to \"die,\" from some imagined  ailment. And yet you doubt the power of the Absolute, to \"think\" things  into being! You tiny students in the great Kindergarten of Life--you  must learn better lessons from your little blocks and games. And you  _will_--this is the Law.    And you who are filled with the sense of your smallness, and  \"unreality\"--know you that so long as you are \"held in the Mind of  God,\" then so long are you \"remembered\" by Him. And so long as you are  remembered by Him, no real harm can befall you, and your Reality is  second only to His own. Even though you pass out of your mortal  frame--doth he remember you in His Mind, and keeping you there, he  holds you safe and unharmed. The greatest satisfaction that can come to  one, is to be able to fully realize that he, or she, is held firmly IN  THE MIND OF THE INFINITE BEING. To such comes the knowledge that in  THAT LIFE there can be NO DEATH.    Peace be with you in this Realization. May you make it your own!          THE SIXTH LESSON      WITHIN THE MIND OF THE ONE.    In our last lesson we gave you the Inner Teachings of the Yogi  Philosophy, relating to the real nature of the Universe, and all that  is therein contained. We trust that you have pondered well and  carefully the statements contained in that lesson, for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#19)"],[1,"the hair is an egg beaten up and rubbed well into the hair,  and afterwards washed out with several washes of warm water.    5. THE ONLY SENSIBLE AND SAFE HAIR OIL.--The following is considered  a most valuable preparation: Take of extract of yellow Peruvian bark,  fifteen grains; extract of rhatany root, eight grains; extract of  burdoch root and oil of nutmegs (fixed), of each two drachms; camphor  (dissolve with spirits of wine), fifteen grains; beef marrow, two  ounces; best olive oil, one ounce; citron juice, half a drachm;  aromatic essential oil, as much as sufficient to render it fragrant;  mix and make into an ointment. Two drachms of bergamot, and a few  drops of attar of roses would suffice.    6. HAIR WASH.--A good hair wash is soap and water, and the oftener it  is applied the freer the surface of the head will be from scurf. The  hair-brush should also be kept in requisition morning and evening.    7. TO REMOVE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.--With those who dislike the use of  arsenic, the following is used for removing superfluous hair from  the skin: Lime, one ounce; carbonate of potash, two ounces; charcoal  powder, one drachm. For use, make it into a paste with a little warm  water, and apply it to the part, previously shaved close. As soon as  it has become thoroughly dry, it may be washed off with a little warm  water.    8. COLORING FOR EYELASHES AND EYEBROWS.--In eyelashes the chief  element of beauty consists in their being long and glossy; the  eyebrows should be finely arched and clearly divided from each other.  The most innocent darkener of the brow is the expressed juice of the  elderberry, or a burnt clove.    [Illustration: JAPANESE MOUSINE MAKING HER TOILET.]    9. CRIMPING HAIR.--To make the hair stay in crimps, take five cents  worth of gum arabic and add to it just enough boiling water to  dissolve it. When dissolved, add enough alcohol to make it rather  thin. Let this stand all night and then bottle it to prevent the  alcohol from evaporating. This put on the hair at night, after it is  done up in papers or pins, will make it stay in crimp the hottest day,  and is perfectly harmless.    10. TO CURL THE HAIR.--There is no preparation that will make  naturally straight hair assume a permanent curl. The following will  keep the hair in curl for a short time: Take borax, two ounces; gum  arabic, one drachm; and hot water, not boiling, one quart; stir, and,  as soon as the ingredients are dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of  strong spirits of camphor. On retiring to rest, wet the hair with the  above liquid, and roll in twists of paper as usual. Do not disturb the  hair until morning, when untwist and form into ringlets.    11. FOR FALLING OR LOOSENING OF THE HAIR.--Take:    Alcohol, a half pint.    Salt, as much as will dissolve.    Glycerine, a tablespoonful.    Flour of sulphur, teaspoonful. Mix.    Rub on the scalp every morning.    12. TO DARKEN THE HAIR WITHOUT BAD EFFECTS.--Take:    Blue vitriol (powdered), one drachm.    Alcohol, one ounce.    Essence of roses, ten drops.    Rain-water, a half-pint.    Shake together until they are thoroughly dissolved.    13. GRAY HAIR.--There are no known means by which the hair can be  prevented from turning gray, and none which can restore it to its  original hue, except through the process of dyeing. The numerous \"hair  color restorers\" which are advertised are chemical preparations  which act in the manner of a dye or as a paint, and are nearly always  dependent for their power on the presence of lead. This mineral,  applied to the skin, for a long time, will lead to the most disastrous  maladies--lead-palsy, lead colic, and other symptoms of poisoning. It  should, therefore, never be used for this purpose.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    HOW TO CURE PIMPLES OR OTHER FACIAL ERUPTIONS.      1. It requires self-denial to get rid of pimples, for persons troubled  with them will persist in eating fat meats and other articles of food  calculated to produce them. Avoid the use of rich gravies, or pastry,  or anything of the kind in excess. Take all the out-door exercise you  can and never indulge in a late supper. Retire at a reasonable hour,  and rise early in the morning. Sulphur to purify the blood may be  taken three times a week--a thimbleful in a glass of milk before  breakfast. It takes some time for the sulphur to do its work,  therefore persevere in its use till the humors, or pimples, or  blotches, disappear. Avoid getting wet while taking the sulphur.    2. TRY THIS RECIPE: Wash the face twice a day in warm water, and rub  dry with a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion made  of two ounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one-half  ounce of liquor potasse. Persons subject to skin eruptions should  avoid very salty or fat food. A dose of Epsom salts occasionally might  prove beneficial.    3. Wash the face in a dilution of carbolic acid, allowing one  teaspoonful to a pint of water. This is an excellent and purifying  lotion, and may be used on the most delicate skins. Be careful about  letting this wash get into the eyes.    4. Oil of sweet almonds, one ounce; fluid potash, one drachm. Shake  well together, and then add rose water, one ounce; pure water, six  ounces. Mix. Rub the pimples or blotches for some minutes with a rough  towel, and then dab them with the lotion.    5. Dissolve one ounce of borax, and sponge the face with it every  night. When there are insects, rub on flower of sulphur, dry after  washing, rub well and wipe dry; use plenty of castile soap.    6. Dilute corrosive sublimate with oil of almonds. A few days'  application will remove them.             *       *       *       *       *    BLACK-HEADS AND FLESH WORMS.      [Illustration: A REGULAR FLESH WORM GREATLY MAGNIFIED.]      This is a minute little creature, scientifically called _Demodex  folliculorum_, hardly visible to the naked eye, with comparatively  large fore body, a more slender hind body and eight little stumpy  processes that do duty as legs. No specialized head is visible,  although of course there is a mouth orifice. These creatures live  on the sweat glands or pores of the human face, and owing to the  appearance that they give to the infested pores, they are usually  known as \"black-heads.\" It is not at all uncommon to see an otherwise  pretty face disfigured by these ugly creatures, although the insects  themselves are nearly transparent white. The black appearance is  really due the accumulation of dirt which gets under the edges of  the skin of the enlarged sweat glands and cannot be removed in the  ordinary way by washing, because the abnormal, hardened secretion of  the gland itself becomes stained. These insects are so lowly organized  that it is almost impossible to satisfactory deal with them and  they sometimes cause the continual festering of the skin which they  inhabit.    REMEDY.--Press them out with a hollow key or with the thumb and  fingers, and apply a mixture of sulphur and cream every evening. Wash  every morning with the best toilet soap, or wash the face with hot  water with a soft flannel at bedtime.    [Illustration: A HEALTHY COMPLEXION.]             *       *       *       *       *    LOVE.        But there's nothing half so sweet in life    As love's young dream.--MOORE.      All love is sweet,    Given or returned. Common as light is love,    And its familiar voice wearies not ever.--SHELLEY.      Doubt thou the stars are fire,    Doubt that the sun doth move;    Doubt truth to be a liar,    But never doubt I love.--SHAKESPEARE.      Let those love now who never loved before,    Let those that always loved now love the more.      1. LOVE BLENDS YOUNG HEARTS.--Love blends young hearts in blissful  unity, and, for the time, so ignores past ties and affections, as to  make willing separation of the son from his father's house, and the  daughter from all the sweet endearments of her childhood's home, to  go out together and rear for themselves an altar, around which shall  cluster all the cares and delights, the anxieties and sympathies, of  the family relationship; this love, if pure, unselfish, and discreet,  constitutes the chief usefulness and happiness of human life.    2. WITHOUT LOVE.--Without love there would be no organized households,  and, consequently, none of that earnest endeavor for competence and  respectability, which is the mainspring to human effort; none of those  sweet, softening, restraining and elevating influences of domestic  life, which can alone fill the earth with the glory of the Lord and  make glad the city of Zion. This love is indeed heaven upon earth; but  above would not be heaven without it; where there is not love, there  is fear; but, \"love casteth out fear.\" And yet we naturally do offend  what we most love.    3. LOVE IS THE SUN OF LIFE.--Most beautiful in morning and evening,  but warmest and steadiest at noon. It is the sun of the soul. Life  without love is worse than death; a world without a sun. The love  which does not lead to labor will soon die out, and the thankfulness  which does not embody itself in sacrifices is already changing to  gratitude. Love is not ripened in one day, nor in many, nor even in  a human lifetime. It is the oneness of soul with soul in appreciation  and perfect trust. To be blessed it must rest in that faith in the  Divine which underlies every other motion. To be true, it must be  eternal as God himself.    4. LOVE IS DEPENDENT.--Remember that love is dependent upon forms;  courtesy of etiquette guards and protects courtesy of heart. How many  hearts have been lost irrevocably, and how many averted eyes and  cold looks have been gained from what seemed, perhaps, but a trifling  negligence of forms.
